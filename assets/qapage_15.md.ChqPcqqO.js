This is the regulation required method of packaging for wool, to keep it uncontaminated and readily identifiable. A \\"bale of wool\\" is also the standard trading unit for wool on the wholesale national and international markets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPackaging of wool has not changed much for centuries except that the early wool packs were made from jute, prior to the use of synthetic fibres. Jute packs were relatively heavy, weighing several kilograms each. In the 1960s polypropylene and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) packs were manufactured and used to make wool bales. Loose fibres from these packs caused contamination of the wool in the bale and led to nylon becoming the regulation fabric used in Australia,[1] In South Africa woven paper was tested but discontinued in 1973 due to poor wet strength and high cost.[2] Regulation standard white nylon packs now have a 280?mm (11?in) label sewn onto the top flap of the wool pack for inclusion of the farm brand, wool description, bale number, woolclasser stencil number and bin code. Each bale of wool packs contains 50 packs that measure 70?cm G?70?cm (27.6?in G?27.6?in) x 98?cm (38.6?in) and have 46?cm (18.1?in) flaps.[3]\\r\\nVery early wool presses were made from wood boards and had a wire winch mechanism to compress the wool and also hollow logs where the wool was tramped into a pack. During the late 19th century various forms of wooden wool press became the standard. Most popular models were the Koerstz and the Ferrier. The Koerstz was a smaller press than the Ferrier. The Ferrier press was manufactured under license by Humble & Nicholson (later Humble & Sons), Geelong, Victoria, and they had sold 2,000 presses between about 1871 and 1918. These presses were distributed throughout Australia, but were also sent overseas to New Zealand, South America, and North Africa.[4] The steel Ajax wool presses were also used. Woolpressing with a manual woolpress was hard, tiring work that required tramping the wool into a box and then pressing it further with a manually operated lever activated cable. Nowadays power operated, self-pinning wool presses with inbuilt scales have made a major contribution to shearing shed productivity.[2]\\r\\nWool bales have been transported by camel, horse teams, bullock wagons, paddle steamer, boats and later by rail and trucks.[5]\\r\\nPressing and branding are typically carried out by a woolpresser in the larger shearing sheds.[6] In small sheds, the pressing may be done by the woolclasser, wool handler or sheep owner. A woolpresser may perform the combined duties of woolpressing and penning up the sheep for the shearers. The latter arrangement means less interruption to the flow of the wool across the table and into the wool bins.[5]\\r\\nThe woolclasser oversees the duties of the woolpresser during the entire shearing. The presser ensures that the wool pack is free of any contaminants before he places it into the wool press and secures it there. He then carries the wool from the selected wool bin, removing any contamination, before placing it into the press.[5]\\r\\nIt takes about 60 skirted fleeces to fill a wool bale, depending on the size and age of the sheep. The presser closes the bale with four internal and five external metal bale fasteners, before weighing the bale, if the press does not have an inbuilt scale. Bales should weigh between 110?kg (243?lb) and 204?kg (450?lb), unless the wool is under 18.6 microns, in which case they may be a minimum gross weight of 90?kg (198?lb). Bales that weigh less than 110?kg (243?lb) are known as a butt and those over 204?kg (450?lb) will not be sold at auction without repacking at the vendors expense. The maximum wool bale length is 1.25 metres (49.2 inches). Overlong bales may create problems with over wide loads when trucking, in brokers' stores and in the jamming of dumping equipment.[7]The presser is responsible for completing the wool book and then branding the bale head and face with the owners brand, contents description, number and wool classer ID. [3]\\r\\nFollowing shearing at the farm, woollen fleeces are placed together in \\"sheets\\", that is to say large sacks containing about 20 rolled fleeces each. These sheets are bulky yet are light (weighing about 60?kg or 132?lb) and convenient for the small famer to transport to his local wool collection centre. Here they are opened for grading and sorting into one of several dozen different qualities, based on breed of sheep, which dictates fineness of wool, and physical condition of the wool, for example damp dirty or stained fleeces will be graded lowly.[citation needed]\\r\\nOnce a sufficient volume of fleeces of a particular grade has filled a grading bin, the wool is compressed into a bale by a packing machine, producing a single bale equivalent to the capacity of some 5 1/2 wool sheets, a weight of 330?kg (728?lb). Such bales are most economical for shipping purposes, but clearly require mechanised lifting equipment.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe collection process for wool in England has remained the same for many centuries. Shepherds brought their fleeces to a local collection point, for example Chipping Camden for wool from the Cotswolds, where it would be graded, paid for, consolidated into bales, sold to wholesalers and shipped to the manufacturer. The existence of bales in ancient times is attested by the custom of the English Lord Chancellor to sit on the so-called Woolsack from which he presides over the House of Lords. This seat is therefore not in reality a \\"sack\\", in which the shepherds probably brought 20 or so fleeces, probably two per mule, being the equivalent of today's \\"sheet\\", but is rather a bale, compacted by the weight of human feet at the merchant's premises.[citation needed]\\r\\nMost Australian wool is sold at auction sales in Sydney, Melbourne, Newcastle, and Fremantle which are conducted by the Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX). There are about 80 brokers and agents throughout Australia.[2]\\r\\nAfter transportation by rail or road to the woolbrokers store, each wool bales brand is carefully inspected to see that it corresponds with the classers report. It is then weighed by sworn weighers (this weight is marked on the bale and recorded and is the basis on which buyers are invoiced), and then core sampled. This sample will then be tested for micron, yield and vegetable matter as a minimum. Wool that is to be sold by sample has a minimum of one grab, of a specified weight, taken from each bale and a minimum of 20 grabs, from each lot. Specialty wool is often traditionally displayed in original wool bales with the test results displayed. Wool not sold by the traditional display system will be directed to various parts in the warehouse for stacking and storing. An index is maintained showing the location of all bales so that, when their turn of offering-which is based on the equitable method of order of receipt into store approaches, they may be easily found.[2]\\r\\nThe sale's programme in all centres is arranged, in the first place, by the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers after consultation with the buyers' organisations. Later, state allocation committees attend to details, such as individual sale dates and the quantity of wool to be offered by each broker in each series of sales at the centres concerned.[8]\\r\\nThe traditionally displayed bales of wool on the floor are opened for examination by the brokers, buyers and wool growers. The sale by sample lots will have their grab samples displayed in boxes across the show floor. Catalogues are prepared by the woolbroker which list all test and other details of each lot of wool.[2]\\r\\nA valuation of every lot, based on current market rates, is also made by the brokers' staff, this being used by the growers as a guideline for the subsequent auction. The lots are sold by nominating each lot in turn and it is sold by open cry auction.\\r\\nAfter the wool is sold at auction the bales are usually dumped i.e. compressed to a higher density, still in the original wool bale, for shipment to overseas mills. Three bales that have been dumped and secured with a metal band are known as a tri pack.[2]","context":"How many sheep to make a bale of wool?"},{"output":"payment in the form of land holdings","context":"A knight is a person granted an honorary title of knighthood by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors.[1] During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings.[2] The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback.\\r\\nKnighthood in the Middle Ages was closely linked with horsemanship (and especially the joust) from its origins in the 12th century until its final flowering as a fashion among the high nobility in the Duchy of Burgundy in the 15th century. This linkage is reflected in the etymology of chivalry, cavalier and related terms (see Etymology section below). The special prestige accorded to mounted warriors finds a parallel in the furusiyya in the Muslim world, and the Greek hippeus (???) and Roman eques of classical antiquity.[3]\\r\\nIn the late medieval period, new methods of warfare began to render classical knights in armour obsolete, but the titles remained in many nations. Today, a number of orders of knighthood continue to exist in Christian Churches, as well as in several historically Christian countries and their former territories, such as the Roman Catholic Order of the Holy Sepulchre, the Protestant Order of Saint John, as well as the English Order of the Garter, the Swedish Royal Order of the Seraphim, and the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. Each of these orders has its own criteria for eligibility, but knighthood is generally granted by a head of state, monarch, or prelate to selected persons to recognise some meritorious achievement, as in the British honours system, often for service to the Church or country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame.\\r\\nHistorically, the ideals of chivalry were popularized in medieval literature, particularly the literary cycles known as the Matter of France, relating to the legendary companions of Charlemagne, and the Matter of Britain, relating to the legend of King Arthur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word knight, from Old English cniht (\\"boy\\" or \\"servant\\"),[4] is a cognate of the German word Knecht (\\"servant, bondsman\\").[5] This meaning, of unknown origin, is common among West Germanic languages (cf Old Frisian kniucht, Dutch knecht, Danish kn?gt, Swedish knekt, Norwegian knekt, Middle High German kneht, all meaning \\"boy, youth, lad\\", as well as German Knecht \\"servant, bondsman, vassal\\").[4] Middle High German had the phrase guoter kneht, which also meant knight; but this meaning was in decline by about 1200.[6]\\r\\nThe meaning of cniht changed over time from its original meaning of \\"boy\\" to \\"household retainer\\". ?lfric's homily of St. Swithun describes a mounted retainer as a cniht. While cnihtas might have fought alongside their lords, their role as household servants features more prominently in the Anglo-Saxon texts. In several Anglo-Saxon wills cnihtas are left either money or lands. In his will, King ?thelstan leaves his cniht, Aelfmar, eight hides of land.[7]\\r\\nA rdcniht, \\"riding-servant\\", was a servant delivering messages or patrolling coastlines on horseback.[citation needed]\\r\\nA narrowing of the generic meaning \\"servant\\" to \\"military follower of a king or other superior\\" is visible by 1100. The specific military sense of a knight as a mounted warrior in the heavy cavalry emerges only in the Hundred Years' War. The verb \\"to knight\\" (to make someone a knight) appears around 1300; and, from the same time, the word \\"knighthood\\" shifted from \\"adolescence\\" to \\"rank or dignity of a knight\\".\\r\\nAn Equestrian (Latin, from eques \\"horseman\\", from equus \\"horse\\")[8] was a member of the second highest social class in the Roman Republic and early Roman Empire. This class is often translated as \\"knight\\"; the medieval knight, however, was called miles in Latin (which in classical Latin meant \\"soldier\\", normally infantry).[9][10][11]\\r\\nIn the later Roman Empire, the classical Latin word for horse, equus, was replaced in common parlance by the vulgar Latin caballus, sometimes thought to derive from Gaulish caballos.[12] From caballus arose terms in the various Romance languages cognate with the (French-derived) English cavalier: Italian cavaliere, Spanish caballero, French chevalier (whence chivalry), Portuguese cavaleiro, and Romanian cavaler.[13] The Germanic languages have terms cognate with the English rider: German Ritter, and Dutch and Scandinavian ridder. These words are derived from Germanic rؐdan, \\"to ride\\", in turn derived from the Proto-Indo-European root reidh-.[14]\\r\\nIn ancient Rome there was a knightly class Ordo Equestris (order of mounted nobles). Some portions of the armies of Germanic peoples who occupied Europe from the 3rd century AD onward had been mounted, and some armies, such as those of the Ostrogoths, were mainly cavalry.[15] However, it was the Franks who generally fielded armies composed of large masses of infantry, with an infantry elite, the comitatus, which often rode to battle on horseback rather than marching on foot. When the armies of the Frankish ruler Charles Martel defeated the Umayyad Arab invasion at the Battle of Tours in 732, the Frankish forces were still largely infantry armies, with elites riding to battle but dismounting to fight.\\r\\nIn the Early Medieval period any well-equipped horseman could be described as a knight, or miles in Latin.[16] The first knights appeared during the reign of Charlemagne in the 8th century.[17][18][19] As the Carolingian Age progressed, the Franks were generally on the attack, and larger numbers of warriors took to their horses to ride with the Emperor in his wide-ranging campaigns of conquest. At about this time the Franks increasingly remained on horseback to fight on the battlefield as true cavalry rather than mounted infantry, with the discovery of the stirrup, and would continue to do so for centuries afterwards.[20] Although in some nations the knight returned to foot combat in the 14th century, the association of the knight with mounted combat with a spear, and later a lance, remained a strong one. The older Carolingian ceremony of presenting a young man with weapons influenced the emergence of knighthood ceremonies, in which a noble would be ritually given weapons and declared to be a knight, usually amid some festivities.[21]\\r\\nThese mobile mounted warriors made Charlemagnes far-flung conquests possible, and to secure their service he rewarded them with grants of land called benefices.[17] These were given to the captains directly by the Emperor to reward their efforts in the conquests, and they in turn were to grant benefices to their warrior contingents, who were a mix of free and unfree men. In the century or so following Charlemagne's death, his newly empowered warrior class grew stronger still, and Charles the Bald declared their fiefs to be hereditary. The period of chaos in the 9th and 10th centuries, between the fall of the Carolingian central authority and the rise of separate Western and Eastern Frankish kingdoms (later to become France and Germany respectively) only entrenched this newly landed warrior class. This was because governing power and defense against Viking, Magyar and Saracen attack became an essentially local affair which revolved around these new hereditary local lords and their demesnes.[18]\\r\\nIn the course of the 12th century knighthood became a social rank, with a distinction being made between milites gregarii (non-noble cavalrymen) and milites nobiles (true knights).[22] As the term \\"knight\\" became increasingly confined to denoting a social rank, the military role of fully armoured cavalryman gained a separate term, \\"man-at-arms\\". Although any medieval knight going to war would automatically serve as a man-at-arms, not all men-at-arms were knights. The first military orders of knighthood were those of the Knights Hospitallers and of the Holy Sepulchre, both founded at the First Crusade of 1099, followed by the Order of Saint Lazarus (1100), Knights Templars (1118) and the Teutonic Knights (1190). At the time of their foundation, these were intended as monastic orders, whose members would act as simple soldiers protecting pilgrims. It was only over the following century, with the successful conquest of the Holy Land and the rise of the crusader states, that these orders became powerful and prestigious.\\r\\nThe great European legends of warriors such as the paladins, the Matter of France and the Matter of Britain popularized the notion of chivalry among the warrior class.[23][24] The ideal of chivalry as the ethos of the Christian warrior, and the transmutation of the term \\"knight\\" from the meaning \\"servant, soldier\\", and of chevalier \\"mounted soldier\\", to refer to a member of this ideal class, is significantly influenced by the Crusades, on one hand inspired by the military orders of monastic warriors, and on the other hand also cross-influenced by Islamic (Saracen) ideals of furusiyya.[24][25]\\r\\nThe institution of knights was already well-established by the 10th century.[26] While the knight was essentially a title denoting a military office, the term could also be used for positions of higher nobility such as landholders. The higher nobles grant the vassals their portions of land (fiefs) in return for their loyalty, protection, and service. The nobles also provided their knights with necessities, such as lodging, food, armour, weapons, horses, and money.[27] The knight generally held his lands by military tenure which was measured through military service that usually lasted 40?days a year. The military service was the quid pro quo for each knight's fief. Vassals and lords could maintain any number of knights, although knights with more military experience were those most sought after. Thus, all petty nobles intending to become prosperous knights needed a great deal of military experience.[26] A knight fighting under another's banner was called a knight bachelor while a knight fighting under his own banner was a knight banneret.\\r\\nA knight had to be born of nobility ÿ typically sons of knights or lords.[27] In some cases commoners could also be knighted as a reward for extraordinary military service. Children of the nobility were cared for by noble foster-mothers in castles until they reached age seven.\\r\\nThe seven-year-old boys were given the title of page and turned over to the care of the castle's lords. They were placed on an early training regime of hunting with huntsmen and falconers, and academic studies with priests or chaplains. Pages then become assistants to older knights in battle, carrying and cleaning armour, taking care of the horses, and packing the baggage. They would accompany the knights on expeditions, even into foreign lands. Older pages were instructed by knights in swordsmanship, equestrianism, chivalry, warfare, and combat (but using wooden swords and spears).\\r\\nWhen the boy turned 15, he became a squire. In a religious ceremony the new squire swore on a sword consecrated by a bishop or priest, and attended to assigned duties in his lords household. During this time the squires continued training in combat and were allowed to own armour (rather than borrowing it).\\r\\nSquires were required to master the seven points of agilities ÿ riding, swimming and diving, shooting different types of weapons, climbing, participation in tournaments, wrestling, fencing, long jumping, and dancing ÿ the prerequisite skills for knighthood. All of these were even performed while wearing armour.[28]\\r\\nUpon turning 21, the squire was eligible to be knighted.\\r\\nThe accolade or knighting ceremony was usually held during one of the great feasts or holidays, like Christmas or Easter, and sometimes at the wedding of a noble or royal. The knighting ceremony usually involved a ritual bath on the eve of the ceremony and a prayer vigil during the night. On the day of the ceremony, the would-be knight would swear an oath and the master of the ceremony would dub the new knight on the shoulders with a sword.[26][27] Squires could also be conferred knighthood early if they showed valor and efficiency in battle.\\r\\nKnights were expected, above all, to fight bravely and to display military professionalism and courtesy. When knights were taken as prisoners of war, they were customarily held for ransom in somewhat comfortable surroundings. This same standard of conduct did not apply to non-knights (archers, peasants, foot-soldiers, etc.) who were often slaughtered after capture, and who were viewed during battle as mere impediments to knights' getting to other knights to fight them.[29]\\r\\nChivalry developed as an early standard of professional ethics for knights, who were relatively affluent horse owners and were expected to provide military services in exchange for landed property. Early notions of chivalry entailed loyalty to one's liege lord and bravery in battle, similar to the values of the Heroic Age. During the Middle Ages, this grew from simple military professionalism into a social code including the values of gentility, nobility and treating others reasonably.[30] In The Song of Roland (c. 1100), Roland is portrayed as the ideal knight, demonstrating unwavering loyalty, military prowess and social fellowship. In Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival (c. 1205), chivalry had become a blend of religious duties, love and military service. Ramon Llull's Book of the Order of Chivalry (1275) demonstrates that by the end of the 13th century, chivalry entailed a litany of very specific duties, including riding warhorses, jousting, attending tournaments, holding Round Tables and hunting, as well as aspiring to the more ?thereal virtues of \\"faith, hope, charity, justice, strength, moderation and loyalty.\\"[31]\\r\\nKnights of the late medieval era were expected by society to maintain all these skills and many more, as outlined in Baldassare Castiglione's The Book of the Courtier, though the book's protagonist, Count Ludovico, states the \\"first and true profession\\" of the ideal courtier \\"must be that of arms.\\"[32] Chivalry, derived from the French word chevalier ('cavalier'), simultaneously denoted skilled horsemanship and military service, and these remained the primary occupations of knighthood throughout the Middle Ages.\\r\\nChivalry and religion were mutually influenced during the period of the Crusades. The early Crusades helped to clarify the moral code of chivalry as it related to religion. As a result, Christian armies began to devote their efforts to sacred purposes. As time passed, clergy instituted religious vows which required knights to use their weapons chiefly for the protection of the weak and defenseless, especially women and orphans, and of churches.[33]\\r\\nWith the rise of Renaissance humanism and moral relativism, the knightÿand chivalry along with himÿlost much of his relevance to society, and the idealism of chivalric romance was fundamentally rejected in Niccol Machiavelli's Il Principe (1532) and more directly derided in Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote (1605ÿ1615). The medieval literary genre of chivalric romance had been the high-water mark of idealism and romanticism in literature, but in the 16th century Machiavelli instructed aspiring political rulers to be ruthlessly pragmatic and to apply the principle that the ends justify the means, directly counter to the high-flown idealism of late medieval chivalry. Later, the high-flown values of chivalric romance were heavily satirized in Cervantes's Don Quixote, which portrayed the charmingly idealistic protagonist as a lovable but hopelessly delusional imbecile.\\r\\nIn peacetime, knights often demonstrated their martial skills in tournaments, which usually took place on the grounds of a castle.[34][35] Knights can parade their armour and banner to the whole court as the tournament commenced. Medieval tournaments were made up of martial sports called hastiludes, and were not only a major spectator sport but also played as a real combat simulation. It usually ended with many knights either injured or even killed. One contest was a free-for-all battle called a melee, where large groups of knights numbering hundreds assembled and fought one another, and the last knight standing was the winner. The most popular and romanticized contest for knights was the joust. In this competition, two knights charge each other with blunt wooden lances in an effort to break their lance on the opponent's head or body or unhorse them completely. The loser in these tournaments had to turn his armour and horse over to the victor. The last day was filled with feasting, dancing and minstrel singing.\\r\\nBesides formal tournaments, they were also unformalized judicial duels done by knights and squires to end various disputes.[36][37] Countries like Germany, Britain and Ireland practiced this tradition. Judicial combat was of two forms in medieval society, the feat of arms and chivalric combat.[36] The feat of arms were done to settle hostilities between two large parties and supervised by a judge. The chivalric combat was fought when one party's honor was disrespected or challenged upon in which the conflict cannot be resolved in court. Weapons were standardized and must be of the same caliber. The duel lasted until the other party was too weak to fight back and in early cases, the defeated party were then subsequently executed. Examples of these brutal duels were the judicial combat known as the Combat of the Thirty in 1351, and the trial by combat fought by Jean de Carrouges in 1386. A far more chivalric duel which became popular in the Late Middle Ages was the pas d'armes or \\"passage of arms\\". In this hastilude, a knight or a group of knights would claim a bridge, lane or city gate, and challenge other passing knights to fight or be disgraced.[38] If a lady passed unescorted, she would leave behind a glove or scarf, to be rescued and returned to her by a future knight who passed that way.\\r\\nOne of the greatest distinguishing marks of the knightly class was the flying of coloured banners, to display power and to distinguish knights in battle and in tournaments.[39] Knights are generally armigerous (bearing a coat of arms), and indeed they played an essential role in the development of heraldry.[40][41] As heavier armour, including enlarged shields and enclosed helmets, developed in the Middle Ages, the need for marks of identification arose, and with coloured shields and surcoats, coat armoury was born. Armourial rolls were created to record the knights of various regions or those who participated in various tournaments.\\r\\nKnights and the ideals of knighthood featured largely in medieval and Renaissance literature, and have secured a permanent place in literary romance.[42] While chivalric romances abound, particularly notable literary portrayals of knighthood include The Song of Roland, Cantar de Mio Cid, The Twelve of England, Geoffrey Chaucer's The Knight's Tale, Baldassare Castiglione's The Book of the Courtier, and Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote, as well as Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur and other Arthurian tales (Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, the Pearl Poet's Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, etc.).\\r\\nGeoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain), written in the 1130s, introduced the legend of King Arthur, which was to be important to the development of chivalric ideals in literature. Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (The Death of Arthur), written in 1485, was important in defining the ideal of chivalry, which is essential to the modern concept of the knight, as an elite warrior sworn to uphold the values of faith, loyalty, courage, and honour.\\r\\nInstructional literature was also created. Geoffroi de Charny's \\"Book of Chivalry\\" expounded upon the importance of Christian faith in every area of a knight's life, though still laying stress on the primarily military focus of knighthood.\\r\\nIn the early Renaissance greater emphasis is laid upon courtliness. The ideal courtierthe chivalrous knightof Baldassarre Castiglione's The Book of the Courtier became a model of the ideal virtues of nobility.[43] Castiglione's tale took the form of a discussion among the nobility of the court of the Duke of Urbino, in which the characters determine that the ideal knight should be renowned not only for his bravery and prowess in battle, but also as a skilled dancer, athlete, singer and orator, and he should also be well-read in the Humanities and classical Greek and Latin literature.[44]\\r\\nLater Renaissance literature, such as Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote, rejected the code of chivalry as unrealistic idealism.[45] The rise of Christian humanism in Renaissance literature demonstrated a marked departure from the chivalric romance of late medieval literature, and the chivalric ideal ceased to influence literature over successive centuries until it saw some pockets of revival in post-Victorian literature.\\r\\nBy the end of the 15th century, knights were becoming obsolete as countries started creating their own professional armies that were quicker to train, cheaper and easier to mobilize.[46][47] The advancement of high-powered firearms eradicated the use of plate armour, as the time it takes to train soldiers with guns is much less compared to that of the knight. The cost of equipment is also significantly lower and guns give a reasonable chance to easily penetrate a knight's armour. In the 14th century the use of infantrymen armed with pikes and fighting in close formation also proved effective against heavy cavalry. An example of this was seen in the Battle of Nancy, when Charles the Bold and his armoured cavalry were decimated by Swiss soldiers only armed with pikes.[48] As the feudal system came to an end, lords saw no further use of knights. Many landowners found the duties of knighthood too expensive and so contented themselves with the use of squires. Mercenaries also became an economic alternative to knights when conflicts arose.\\r\\nArmies of the time started adopting a more realistic approach to warfare than the honor-bound code of chivalry. Soon, the remaining knights were absorbed into professional armies. Although they have a higher rank than most soldiers because of their valuable lineage, they have lost their distinctive identity that previously set them apart from other common soldiers.[46] As the age of knights dissolved, some still survived as knightly orders who still exist even by the end of the Medieval Age. They adopted newer technology while still retaining their age-old chivalric traditions. Examples of holy orders that existed beyond the Middle Ages were the Knights Hospitallers and Teutonic Knights.[49]\\r\\nOther orders were established in the Iberian peninsula, under the influence of the orders in the Holy Land and the Crusader movement of the Reconquista:\\r\\nAfter the Crusades, the military orders became idealized and romanticized, resulting in the late medieval notion of chivalry, as reflected in the Arthurian romances of the time. The creation of chivalric orders was fashionable among the nobility in the 14th and 15th centuries, and this is still reflected in contemporary honours systems, including the term order itself. Examples of notable orders of chivalry are:\\r\\nFrom roughly 1560, purely honorific orders were established, as a way to confer prestige and distinction, unrelated to military service and chivalry in the more narrow sense. Such orders were particularly popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, and knighthood continues to be conferred in various countries:\\r\\nThere are other monarchies and also republics that also follow this practice. Modern knighthoods are typically conferred in recognition for services rendered to society, which are not necessarily martial in nature. The British musician Elton John, for example, is a Knight Bachelor, thus entitled to be called Sir Elton. The female equivalent is a Dame, for example Dame Julie Andrews.\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, honorific knighthood may be conferred in two different ways:\\r\\nThe first is by membership of one of the pure Orders of Chivalry such as the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle and the dormant Order of Saint Patrick, of which all members are knighted. In addition, many British Orders of Merit, namely the Order of the Bath, the Order of St Michael and St George, the Royal Victorian Order and the Order of the British Empire are part of the British honours system, and the award of their highest ranks (Knight/Dame Commander and Knight/Dame Grand Cross), comes together with an honorific knighthood, making them a cross between orders of chivalry and orders of merit. By contrast, membership of other British Orders of Merit, such as the Distinguished Service Order, the Order of Merit and the Order of the Companions of Honour does not confer a knighthood.\\r\\nThe second is being granted honorific knighthood by the British sovereign without membership of an order, the recipient being called Knight Bachelor.\\r\\nIn the British honours system the knightly style of Sir is accompanied by the given name, and optionally the surname. So, Elton John may be called Sir Elton or Sir Elton John, but never Sir John. Similarly, actress Judi Dench DBE may be addressed as Dame Judi or Dame Judi Dench, but never Dame Dench.\\r\\nWives of knights, however, are entitled to the honorific pre-nominal \\"Lady\\" before their husband's surname. Thus Sir Paul McCartney's ex-wife was formally styled Lady McCartney (rather than Lady Paul McCartney or Lady Heather McCartney). The style Dame Heather McCartney could be used for the wife of a knight; however, this style is largely archaic and is only used in the most formal of documents, or where the wife is a Dame in her own right (such as Dame Norma Major, who gained her title six years before her husband Sir John Major was knighted). The husbands of Dames have no honorific pre-nominal, so Dame Norma's husband remained John Major until he received his own knighthood.\\r\\nSince the reign of Edward VII a clerk in holy orders in the Church of England has not normally received the accolade on being appointed to a degree of knighthood. He receives the insignia of his honour and may place the appropriate letters after his name or title but he may not be called Sir and his wife may not be called Lady. This custom is not observed in Australia and New Zealand, where knighted Anglican clergymen routinely use the title \\"Sir\\". Ministers of other Christian Churches are entitled to receive the accolade. For example, Sir Norman Cardinal Gilroy did receive the accolade on his appointment as Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1969. A knight who is subsequently ordained does not lose his title. A famous example of this situation was The Revd Sir Derek Pattinson, who was ordained just a year after he was appointed Knight Bachelor, apparently somewhat to the consternation of officials at Buckingham Palace.[50] A woman clerk in holy orders may be made a Dame in exactly the same way as any other woman since there are no military connotations attached to the honour. A clerk in holy orders who is a baronet is entitled to use the title Sir.\\r\\nOutside the British honours system it is usually considered improper to address a knighted person as 'Sir' or 'Dame'. Some countries, however, historically did have equivalent honorifics for knights, such as Cavaliere in Italy (e.g. Cavaliere Benito Mussolini), and Ritter in Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire (e.g. Georg Ritter von Trapp).\\r\\nState Knighthoods in the Netherlands are issued in three orders, the Order of William, the Order of the Netherlands Lion, and the Order of Orange Nassau. Additionally there remain a few hereditary knights in the Netherlands.\\r\\nIn Belgium, honorific knighthood (not hereditary) can be conferred by the King on particularly meritorious individuals such as scientists or eminent businessmen, or for instance to astronaut Frank De Winne, the second Belgian in space. This practice is similar to the conferal of the dignity of Knight Bachelor in the United Kingdom. In addition, there still are a number of hereditary knights in Belgium (see below).\\r\\nIn France and Belgium, one of the ranks conferred in some Orders of Merit, such as the Lgion d'Honneur, the Ordre National du Mrite, the Ordre des Palmes acadmiques and the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France, and the Order of Leopold, Order of the Crown and Order of Leopold II in Belgium, is that of Chevalier (in French) or Ridder (in Dutch), meaning Knight.\\r\\nIn the PolishÿLithuanian Commonwealth the monarchs tried to establish chivalric orders but the hereditary lords who controlled the Union did not agree and managed to ban such assemblies. They feared the King would use Orders to gain support for absolutist goals and to make formal distinctions among the peerage which could lead to its legal breakup into two separate classes, and that the King would later play one against the other and eventually limit the legal privileges of hereditary nobility. But finally in 1705 King August II managed to establish the Order of the White Eagle which remains Poland's most prestigious order of that kind. The head of state (now the President as the acting Grand Master) confers knighthoods of the Order to distinguished citizens, foreign monarchs and other heads of state. The Order has its Chapter. There were no particular honorifics that would accompany a knight's name as historically all (or at least by far most) its members would be royals or hereditary lords anyway. So today, a knight is simply referred to as \\"Name Surname, knight of the White Eagle (Order)\\".\\r\\nIn continental Europe different systems of hereditary knighthood have existed or do exist. Ridder, Dutch for \\"knight\\", is a hereditary noble title in the Netherlands. It is the lowest title within the nobility system and ranks below that of \\"Baron\\" but above \\"Jonkheer\\" (the latter is not a title, but a Dutch honorific to show that someone belongs to the untitled nobility). The collective term for its holders in a certain locality is the Ridderschap (e.g. Ridderschap van Holland, Ridderschap van Friesland, etc.). In the Netherlands no female equivalent exists. Before 1814, the history of nobility is separate for each of the eleven provinces that make up the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In each of these, there were in the early Middle Ages a number of feudal lords who often were just as powerful, and sometimes more so than the rulers themselves. In old times, no other title existed but that of knight. In the Netherlands only 10 knightly families are still extant, a number which steadily decreases because in that country ennoblement or incorporation into the nobility is not possible anymore.\\r\\nLikewise Ridder, Dutch for \\"knight\\", or the equivalent French Chevalier is a hereditary noble title in Belgium. It is the second lowest title within the nobility system above cuyer or Jonkheer/Jonkvrouw and below Baron. Like in the Netherlands, no female equivalent to the title exists. Belgium still does have about 232 registered knightly families.\\r\\nThe German and Austrian equivalent of an hereditary knight is a Ritter. This designation is used as a title of nobility in all German-speaking areas. Traditionally it denotes the second lowest rank within the nobility, standing above \\"Edler\\" (Noble) and below \\"Freiherr\\" (baron). For its historical association with warfare and the landed gentry in the Middle Ages, it can be considered roughly equal to the titles of \\"Knight\\" or \\"Baronet\\".\\r\\nThe Royal House of Portugal historically bestowed hereditary knighthoods to holders of the highest ranks in the Royal Orders. Today, the head of the Royal House of Portugal HRH Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza bestows hereditary knighthoods for extraordinary acts of sacrifice and service to the Royal House. There are very few hereditary knights and they are entitled to wear a breast star with the crest of the House of Braganza.\\r\\nIn France, the hereditary knighthood existed in regions formerly under Holy Roman Empire control. One family ennobled with that title is the house of Hauteclocque (by letters patents of 1752), even if its most recent members used a pontifical title of count.\\r\\nItaly and Poland also had the hereditary knighthood that existed within the nobility system.\\r\\nThere are traces of the Continental system of hereditary knighthood in Ireland. Notably all three of the following belong to the Welsh-Norman FitzGerald dynasty, created by the Earls of Desmond, acting as Earls Palatine, for their kinsmen.\\r\\nAnother Irish family were the O'Shaughnessys, who were created knights in 1553 under the policy of Surrender and regrant[51] (first established by Henry VIII of England). They were attainted in 1697 for participation on the Jacobite side in the Williamite wars. [52]\\r\\nSince 1611, the British Crown has awarded a hereditary title in the form of the baronetcy.[53] Like knights, baronets are accorded the title Sir. Baronets are not peers of the Realm, and have never been entitled to sit in the House of Lords, therefore like knights they remain commoners in the view of the British legal system. However, unlike knights, the title is hereditary and the recipient does not receive an accolade. The position is therefore more comparable with hereditary knighthoods in continental European orders of nobility, such as ritter, than with knighthoods under the British orders of chivalry. However, unlike the continental orders, the British baronetcy system was a modern invention, designed specifically to raise money for the Crown with the purchase of the title.\\r\\nWomen were appointed to the Order of the Garter almost from the start. In all, 68 women were appointed between 1358 and 1488, including all consorts. Though many were women of royal blood, or wives of knights of the Garter, some women were neither. They wore the garter on the left arm, and some are shown on their tombstones with this arrangement. After 1488, no other appointments of women are known, although it is said that the Garter was conferred upon Neapolitan poet Laura Bacio Terricina, by King Edward VI. In 1638, a proposal was made to revive the use of robes for the wives of knights in ceremonies, but this did not occur. Queen consorts have been made Ladies of the Garter since 1901 (Queens Alexandra in 1901,[54] Mary in 1910 and Elizabeth in 1937). The first non-royal woman to be made Lady Companion of the Garter was The Duchess of Norfolk in 1990,[55] the second was The Baroness Thatcher in 1995[56] (post-nominal: LG). On 30 November 1996, Lady Fraser was made Lady of the Thistle,[57] the first non-royal woman (post-nominal: LT). (See Edmund Fellowes, Knights of the Garter, 1939; and Beltz: Memorials of the Order of the Garter). The first woman to be granted a knighthood in modern Britain seems to have been H.H. Nawab Sikandar Begum Sahiba, Nawab Begum of Bhopal, who became a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) in 1861, at the foundation of the order. Her daughter received the same honor in 1872, as well as her granddaughter in 1910. The order was open to \\"princes and chiefs\\" without distinction of gender. The first European woman to have been granted an order of knighthood was Queen Mary, when she was made a Knight Grand Commander of the same order, by special statute, in celebration of the Delhi Durbar of 1911.[58] She was also granted a damehood in 1917 as a Dame Grand Cross, when the Order of the British Empire was created[59] (it was the first order explicitly open to women). The Royal Victorian Order was opened to women in 1936, and the Orders of the Bath and Saint Michael and Saint George in 1965 and 1971 respectively.[60]\\r\\nMedieval French had two words, chevaleresse and chevalire, which were used in two ways: one was for the wife of a knight, and this usage goes back to the 14th century. The other was possibly for a female knight. Here is a quote from Menestrier, a 17th-century writer on chivalry: \\"It was not always necessary to be the wife of a knight in order to take this title. Sometimes, when some male fiefs were conceded by special privilege to women, they took the rank of chevaleresse, as one sees plainly in Hemricourt where women who were not wives of knights are called chevaleresses.\\" Modern French orders of knighthood include women, for example the Lgion d'Honneur (Legion of Honor) since the mid-19th century, but they are usually called chevaliers. The first documented case is that of Anglique Br?lon (1772ÿ1859), who fought in the Revolutionary Wars, received a military disability pension in 1798, the rank of 2nd lieutenant in 1822, and the Legion of Honor in 1852. A recipient of the Ordre National du Mrite recently requested from the order's Chancery the permission to call herself \\"chevalire,\\" and the request was granted (AFP dispatch, Jan 28, 2000).[60]\\r\\nAs related in Orders of Knighthood, Awards and the Holy See by H. E. Cardinale (1983), the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary was founded by two Bolognese nobles Loderingo degli Andal and Catalano di Guido in 1233, and approved by Pope Alexander IV in 1261. It was the first religious order of knighthood to grant the rank of militissa to women. However, this order was suppressed by Sixtus V in 1558.[60]\\r\\nAt the initiative of Catherine Baw in 1441, and 10 years later of Elizabeth, Mary, and Isabella of the house of Hornes, orders were founded which were open exclusively to women of noble birth, who received the French title of chevalire or the Latin title of equitissa. In his Glossarium (s.v. militissa), Du Cange notes that still in his day (17th century), the female canons of the canonical monastery of St. Gertrude in Nivelles (Brabant), after a probation of 3 years, are made knights (militissae) at the altar, by a (male) knight called in for that purpose, who gives them the accolade with a sword and pronounces the usual words.[60]\\r\\nTo honour those women who defended Tortosa against an attack by the Moors, Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona, created the Order of the Hatchet (Orden de la Hacha) in 1149.[60]\\r\\nThe inhabitants [of Tortosa] being at length reduced to great streights, desired relief of the Earl, but he, being not in a condition to give them any, they entertained some thoughts of making a surrender. Which the Women hearing of, to prevent the disaster threatening their City, themselves, and Children, put on men's Clothes, and by a resolute sally, forced the Moors to raise the Siege. The Earl, finding himself obliged, by the gallentry of the action, thought fit to make his acknowlegements thereof, by granting them several Privileges and Immunities, and to perpetuate the memory of so signal an attempt, instituted an Order, somewhat like a Military Order, into which were admitted only those Brave Women, deriving the honour to their Descendants, and assigned them for a Badge, a thing like a Fryars Capouche, sharp at the top, after the form of a Torch, and of a crimson colour, to be worn upon their Head-clothes. He also ordained, that at all publick meetings, the women should have precedence of the Men. That they should be exempted from all Taxes, and that all the Apparel and Jewels, though of never so great value, left by their dead Husbands, should be their own. These Women having thus acquired this Honour by their personal Valour, carried themselves after the Military Knights of those days.","input":"What were knights paid in the middle ages?"},{"output":"March 28, 1979","context":"The Three Mile Island accident occurred on March 28, 1979, in reactor number 2 of Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station (TMI-2) in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, near Harrisburg. It was the most significant accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant history.[2] The incident was rated a five on the seven-point International Nuclear Event Scale: Accident with wider consequences.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accident began with failures in the non-nuclear secondary system, followed by a stuck-open pilot-operated relief valve in the primary system, which allowed large amounts of nuclear reactor coolant to escape. The mechanical failures were compounded by the initial failure of plant operators to recognize the situation as a loss-of-coolant accident due to inadequate training and human factors, such as human-computer interaction design oversights relating to ambiguous control room indicators in the power plant's user interface. In particular, a hidden indicator light led to an operator manually overriding the automatic emergency cooling system of the reactor because the operator mistakenly believed that there was too much coolant water present in the reactor and causing the steam pressure release.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accident crystallized anti-nuclear safety concerns among activists and the general public, resulted in new regulations for the nuclear industry, and has been cited as a contributor to the decline of a new reactor construction program that was already underway in the 1970s.[6] The partial meltdown resulted in the release of radioactive gases and radioactive iodine into the environment. Worries were expressed by anti-nuclear movement activists;[7] however, epidemiological studies analyzing the rate of cancer in and around the area since the accident, determined there was a small statistically non-significant increase in the rate and thus no causal connection linking the accident with these cancers has been substantiated.[8][9][10][11][12][13] Cleanup started in August 1979, and officially ended in December 1993, with a total cleanup cost of about $1?billion.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the nighttime hours preceding the incident, the TMI-2 reactor was running at 97% of power, while the companion TMI-1 reactor was shut down for refueling.[16] The main chain of events leading to the partial core meltdown began at 4:37?am EST on March 28, 1979, in TMI-2's secondary loop, one of the three main water/steam loops in a pressurized water reactor (PWR).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial cause of the accident happened eleven hours earlier, during an attempt by operators to fix a blockage in one of the eight condensate polishers, the sophisticated filters cleaning the secondary loop water. These filters are designed to stop minerals and impurities in the water from accumulating in the steam generators and increasing corrosion rates in the secondary side.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlockages are common with these resin filters and are usually fixed easily, but in this case the usual method of forcing the stuck resin out with compressed air did not succeed. The operators decided to blow the compressed air into the water and let the force of the water clear the resin. When they forced the resin out, a small amount of water forced its way past a stuck-open check valve and found its way into an instrument air line. This would eventually cause the feedwater pumps, condensate booster pumps, and condensate pumps to turn off around 4:00?am, which would in turn cause a turbine trip.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the steam generators no longer receiving feedwater, heat and pressure increased in the reactor coolant system, causing the reactor to perform an emergency shutdown (SCRAM). Within eight seconds, control rods were inserted into the core to halt the nuclear chain reaction. The reactor continued to generate decay heat and, because steam was no longer being used by the turbine, heat was no longer being removed from the reactor's primary water loop.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the secondary feedwater pumps stopped, three auxiliary pumps activated automatically. However, because the valves had been closed for routine maintenance, the system was unable to pump any water. The closure of these valves was a violation of a key Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) rule, according to which the reactor must be shut down if all auxiliary feed pumps are closed for maintenance. This was later singled out by NRC officials as a key failure.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loss of heat removal from the primary loop and the failure of the auxiliary system to activate caused the primary loop pressure to increase, triggering the pilot-operated relief valve  at the top of the pressurizer?ÿ a pressure active-regulator tank?ÿ to open automatically. The relief valve should have closed when the excess pressure had been released, and electric power to the solenoid of the pilot was automatically cut, but the relief valve stuck open because of a mechanical fault. The open valve permitted coolant water to escape from the primary system, and was the principal mechanical cause of the primary coolant system depressurization and partial core disintegration that followed.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nCritical user interface engineering problems were revealed in the investigation of the reactor control system's user interface. Despite the valve being stuck open, a light on the control panel ostensibly indicated that the valve was closed. In fact the light did not indicate the position of the valve, only the status of the solenoid being powered or not, thus giving false evidence of a closed valve.[21] As a result, the operators did not correctly diagnose the problem for several hours.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design of the pilot-operated relief valve indicator light was fundamentally flawed. The bulb was simply connected in parallel with the valve solenoid, thus implying that the pilot-operated relief valve was shut when it went dark, without actually verifying the real position of the valve. When everything was operating correctly, the indication was true and the operators became habituated to rely on it. However, when things went wrong and the main relief valve stuck open, the unlighted lamp was actually misleading the operators by implying that the valve was shut. This caused the operators considerable confusion, because the pressure, temperature and coolant levels in the primary circuit, so far as they could observe them via their instruments, were not behaving as they would have if the pilot-operated relief valve were shut. This confusion contributed to the severity of the accident because the operators were unable to break out of a cycle of assumptions that conflicted with what their instruments were telling them. The problem was not correctly diagnosed until a fresh shift came in who did not have the mindset of the first shift of operators. By this time major damage had occurred.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe operators had not been trained to understand the ambiguous nature of the pilot-operated relief valve indicator and to look for alternative confirmation that the main relief valve was closed. There was a temperature indicator downstream of the pilot-operated relief valve in the tail pipe between the pilot-operated relief valve and the pressurizer relief tank that could have told them the valve was stuck open by showing that the temperature in the tail pipe remained higher than it should have been had the pilot-operated relief valve been shut. This temperature indicator, however, was not part of the \\"safety grade\\" suite of indicators designed to be used after an incident, and the operators had not been trained to use it. Its location on the back of the seven-foot-high instrument panel also meant that it was effectively out of sight of the operators.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the pressure in the primary system continued to decrease, reactor coolant continued to flow, but it was boiling inside the core. First, small bubbles of steam formed and immediately collapsed, known as nucleate boiling. As the system pressure decreased further, steam pockets began to form in the reactor coolant. This departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) into the regime of \\"film boiling\\" caused steam voids in coolant channels, blocking the flow of liquid coolant and greatly increasing the fuel cladding temperature. The overall water level inside the pressurizer was rising despite the loss of coolant through the open pilot-operated relief valve, as the volume of these steam voids increased much more quickly than coolant was lost. Because of the lack of a dedicated instrument to measure the level of water in the core, operators judged the level of water in the core solely by the level in the pressurizer. Since it was high, they assumed that the core was properly covered with coolant, unaware that because of steam forming in the reactor vessel, the indicator provided misleading readings.[24] Indications of high water levels contributed to the confusion, as operators were concerned about the primary loop \\"going solid,\\" (i.e. no steam pocket buffer existing in the pressurizer) which in training they had been instructed to never allow. This confusion was a key contributor to the initial failure to recognize the accident as a loss-of-coolant accident, and led operators to turn off the emergency core cooling pumps, which had automatically started after the pilot-operated relief valve stuck and core coolant loss began, due to fears the system was being overfilled.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the pilot-operated relief valve still open, the pressurizer relief tank that collected the discharge from the pilot-operated relief valve overfilled, causing the containment building sump to fill and sound an alarm at 4:11?am. This alarm, along with higher than normal temperatures on the pilot-operated relief valve discharge line and unusually high containment building temperatures and pressures, were clear indications that there was an ongoing loss-of-coolant accident, but these indications were initially ignored by operators.[26] At 4:15?am, the relief diaphragm of the pressurizer relief tank ruptured, and radioactive coolant began to leak out into the general containment building. This radioactive coolant was pumped from the containment building sump to an auxiliary building, outside the main containment, until the sump pumps were stopped at 4:39?am.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter almost 80?minutes of slow temperature rise, the primary loop's four main reactor coolant pumps began to cavitate as a steam bubble/water mixture, rather than water, passed through them. The pumps were shut down, and it was believed that natural circulation would continue the water movement. Steam in the system prevented flow through the core, and as the water stopped circulating it was converted to steam in increasing amounts. About 130?minutes after the first malfunction, the top of the reactor core was exposed and the intense heat caused a reaction to occur between the steam forming in the reactor core and the Zircaloy nuclear fuel rod cladding, yielding zirconium dioxide, hydrogen, and additional heat. This reaction melted the nuclear fuel rod cladding and damaged the fuel pellets, which released radioactive isotopes to the reactor coolant, and produced hydrogen gas that is believed to have caused a small explosion in the containment building later that afternoon.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 6?am, there was a shift change in the control room. A new arrival noticed that the temperature in the pilot-operated relief valve tail pipe and the holding tanks was excessive and used a backup valve?ÿ called a \\"block valve\\"?ÿ to shut off the coolant venting via the pilot-operated relief valve, but around 32,000?US?gal (120,000?l) of coolant had already leaked from the primary loop.[29] It was not until 165 minutes after the start of the problem that radiation alarms activated as contaminated water reached detectors; by that time, the radiation levels in the primary coolant water were around 300?times expected levels, and the general containment building was seriously contaminated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 6:57?am, a plant supervisor declared a site area emergency, and less than 30?minutes later station manager Gary Miller announced a general emergency, defined as having the \\"potential for serious radiological consequences\\" to the general public.[30] Metropolitan Edison (Met Ed) notified the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA), which in turn contacted state and local agencies, Governor Richard L. Thornburgh and lieutenant governor William Scranton III, to whom Thornburgh assigned responsibility for collecting and reporting on information about the accident.[31] The uncertainty of operators at the plant was reflected in fragmentary, ambiguous, or contradictory statements made by Met Ed to government agencies and to the press, particularly about the possibility and severity of off-site radioactivity releases. Scranton held a press conference in which he was reassuring, yet confusing, about this possibility, stating that though there had been a \\"small release of radiation...no increase in normal radiation levels\\" had been detected. These were contradicted by another official, and by statements from Met Ed, who both claimed that no radioactivity had been released.[32] In fact, readings from instruments at the plant and off-site detectors had detected radioactivity releases, albeit at levels that were unlikely to threaten public health as long as they were temporary, and providing that containment of the then highly contaminated reactor was maintained.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nAngry that Met Ed had not informed them before conducting a steam venting from the plant, and convinced that the company was downplaying the severity of the accident, state officials turned to the NRC.[34] After receiving word of the accident from Met Ed, the NRC had activated its emergency response headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland and sent staff members to Three Mile Island. NRC chairman Joseph Hendrie and commissioner Victor Gilinsky[35] initially viewed the accident, in the words of NRC historian Samuel Walker, as a \\"cause for concern but not alarm\\".[36] Gilinsky briefed reporters and members of Congress on the situation and informed White House staff, and at 10:00?a.m. met with two other commissioners. However, the NRC faced the same problems in obtaining accurate information as the state, and was further hampered by being organizationally ill-prepared to deal with emergencies, as it lacked a clear command structure and the authority to tell the utility what to do, or to order an evacuation of the local area.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2009 article, Gilinsky wrote that it took five weeks to learn that \\"the reactor operators had measured fuel temperatures near the melting point\\".[38] He further wrote: \\"We didn't learn for years?ÿ until the reactor vessel was physically opened?ÿ that by the time the plant operator called the NRC at about 8:00?a.m., roughly half of the uranium fuel had already melted.\\"[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was still not clear to the control room staff that the primary loop water levels were low and that over half of the core was exposed. A group of workers took manual readings from the thermocouples and obtained a sample of primary loop water. Seven hours into the emergency, new water was pumped into the primary loop and the backup relief valve was opened to reduce pressure so that the loop could be filled with water. After 16?hours the primary loop pumps were turned on once again, and the core temperature began to fall. A large part of the core had melted, and the system was still dangerously radioactive.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the third day following the accident, a hydrogen bubble was discovered in the dome of the pressure vessel, and became the focus of concern. A hydrogen explosion might not only breach the pressure vessel, but, depending on its magnitude, might compromise the integrity of the containment vessel leading to large-scale release of radioactive material. However, it was determined that there was no oxygen present in the pressure vessel, a prerequisite for hydrogen to burn or explode. Immediate steps were taken to reduce the hydrogen bubble, and by the following day it was significantly smaller. Over the next week, steam and hydrogen were removed from the reactor using a catalytic recombiner and, controversially, by venting straight to the atmosphere.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe release occurred when the cladding was damaged while the pilot-operated relief valve was still stuck open. Fission products were released into the reactor coolant. Since the pilot-operated relief valve was stuck open and the loss of coolant accident was still in progress, primary coolant with fission products and/or fuel was released, and ultimately ended up in the auxiliary building. The auxiliary building was outside the containment boundary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was evidenced by the radiation alarms that eventually sounded. However, since very little of the fission products released were solids at room temperature, very little radiological contamination was reported in the environment. No significant level of radiation was attributed to the TMI-2 accident outside of the TMI-2 facility. According to the Rogovin report, the vast majority of the radioisotopes released were the noble gases xenon and krypton. The report stated, \\"During the course of the accident, approximately 2.5?MCi (93?PBq) of radioactive noble gases and 15?Ci (560?GBq) of radioiodines were released.\\" This resulted in an average dose of 1.4?mrem (14?Sv) to the two million people near the plant. The report compared this with the additional 80?mrem (800?Sv) per year received from living in a high altitude city such as Denver.[39] As further comparison, a patient receives 3.2?mrem (32?Sv) from a chest X-ray ÿ more than twice the average dose of those received near the plant.[40]  Measures of beta radiation were excluded from the report.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin hours of the accident, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began daily sampling of the environment at the three stations closest to the plant. Continuous monitoring at 11?stations was not established until April 1, and was expanded to 31 stations on April 3. An inter-agency analysis concluded that the accident did not raise radioactivity far enough above background levels to cause even one additional cancer death among the people in the area, but measures of beta radiation were not included. The EPA found no contamination in water, soil, sediment or plant samples.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers at nearby Dickinson College?ÿ which had radiation monitoring equipment sensitive enough to detect Chinese atmospheric atomic weapons-testing?ÿ collected soil samples from the area for the ensuing two weeks and detected no elevated levels of radioactivity, except after rainfalls (likely due to natural radon plate-out, not the accident).[42] Also, white-tailed deer tongues harvested over 50?mi (80?km) from the reactor subsequent to the accident were found to have significantly higher levels of cesium-137 than in deer in the counties immediately surrounding the power plant. Even then, the elevated levels were still below those seen in deer in other parts of the country during the height of atmospheric weapons testing.[43] Had there been elevated releases of radioactivity, increased levels of iodine-131 and cesium-137 would have been expected to be detected in cattle and goat's milk samples. Yet elevated levels were not found.[44] A later study noted that the official emission figures were consistent with available dosimeter data,[45] though others have noted the incompleteness of this data, particularly for releases early on.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the official figures, as compiled by the 1979 Kemeny Commission from Metropolitan Edison and NRC data, a maximum of 480?PBq (13?MCi) of radioactive noble gases (primarily xenon) were released by the event.[47] However, these noble gases were considered relatively harmless,[48] and only 481ÿ629?GBq (13.0ÿ17.0?Ci) of thyroid cancer-causing iodine-131 were released.[47] Total releases according to these figures were a relatively small proportion of the estimated 370?EBq (10?GCi) in the reactor.[48] It was later found that about half the core had melted, and the cladding around 90% of the fuel rods had failed,[15][49] with 5?ft (1.5?m) of the core gone, and around 20 short tons (18?t) of uranium flowing to the bottom head of the pressure vessel, forming a mass of corium.[50] The reactor vessel?ÿ the second level of containment after the cladding?ÿ maintained integrity and contained the damaged fuel with nearly all of the radioactive isotopes in the core.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnti-nuclear political groups disputed the Kemeny Commission's findings, claiming that independent measurements provided evidence of radiation levels up to seven times higher than normal in locations hundreds of miles downwind from TMI.[52] Arnie Gundersen, a nuclear engineer and former nuclear industry manager, said \\"I think the numbers on the NRC's website are off by a factor of 100 to 1,000\\".[48][53]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome other insiders[who?] make the same claim; Gundersen, a former nuclear industry executive who is now an expert witness in nuclear safety issues,[54][55] offers evidence, based on pressure monitoring data, for a hydrogen explosion shortly before 2:00?p.m. on March 28, 1979, which would have provided the means for a high dose of radiation to occur.[48] Gundersen cites affidavits from four reactor operators according to which the plant manager was aware of a dramatic pressure spike, after which the internal pressure dropped to outside pressure. Gundersen also notes that the control room shook and doors were blown off hinges. However official NRC reports refer merely to a \\"hydrogen burn.\\"[48] The Kemeny Commission referred to \\"a burn or an explosion that caused pressure to increase by 28?pounds per square inch in the containment building\\".[56] The Washington Post reported that \\"At about 2:00?pm, with pressure almost down to the point where the huge cooling pumps could be brought into play, a small hydrogen explosion jolted the reactor.\\"[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty-eight hours after the accident began, William Scranton III, the lieutenant governor, appeared at a news briefing to say that Metropolitan Edison, the plant's owner, had assured the state that \\"everything is under control\\".[58] Later that day, Scranton changed his statement, saying that the situation was \\"more complex than the company first led us to believe.\\"[58] There were conflicting statements about radioactivity releases.[59] Schools were closed and residents were urged to stay indoors. Farmers were told to keep their animals under cover and on stored feed.[58][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor Dick Thornburgh, on the advice of NRC chairman Joseph Hendrie, advised the evacuation \\"of pregnant women and pre-school age children...within a five-mile radius of the Three Mile Island facility.\\" The evacuation zone was extended to a 20-mile radius on Friday, March 30.[60] Within days, 140,000 people had left the area.[15][58][61] More than half of the 663,500 population within the 20-mile radius remained in that area.[62][60] According to a survey conducted in April 1979, 98% of the evacuees had returned to their homes within three weeks.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nPost-TMI surveys have shown that less than 50% of the American public were satisfied with the way the accident was handled by Pennsylvania State officials and the NRC, and people surveyed were even less pleased with the utility (General Public Utilities) and the plant designer.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral state and federal government agencies mounted investigations into the crisis, the most prominent of which was the President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island, created by Jimmy Carter in April 1979.[64] The commission consisted of a panel of twelve people, specifically chosen for their lack of strong pro- or anti-nuclear views, and headed by chairman John G. Kemeny, president of Dartmouth College. It was instructed to produce a final report within six months, and after public hearings, depositions, and document collection, released a completed study on October 31, 1979.[65] The investigation strongly criticized Babcock & Wilcox, Met Ed, GPU, and the NRC for lapses in quality assurance and maintenance, inadequate operator training, lack of communication of important safety information, poor management, and complacency, but avoided drawing conclusions about the future of the nuclear industry.[66] The heaviest criticism from the Kemeny Commission concluded that \\"fundamental changes were necessary in the organization, procedures, practices 'and above all ÿ in the attitudes' of the NRC [and the nuclear industry.]\\"[67] Kemeny said that the actions taken by the operators were \\"inappropriate\\" but that the workers \\"were operating under procedures that they were required to follow, and our review and study of those indicates that the procedures were inadequate\\" and that the control room \\"was greatly inadequate for managing an accident.\\"[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kemeny Commission noted that Babcock & Wilcox's pilot-operated relief valve had previously failed on 11?occasions, nine of them in the open position, allowing coolant to escape. More disturbing, however, was the fact that the initial causal sequence of events at TMI had been duplicated 18?months earlier at another Babcock & Wilcox reactor, the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station owned at that time by Toledo Edison. The only difference was that the operators at Davis-Besse identified the valve failure after 20?minutes, where at TMI it took 80 minutes, and the Davis-Besse facility was operating at 9% power, against TMI's 97%. Although Babcock engineers recognized the problem, the company failed to clearly notify its customers of the valve issue.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pennsylvania House of Representatives conducted its own investigation, which focused on the need to improve evacuation procedures[citation needed].\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1985, a television camera was used to see the interior of the damaged reactor. In 1986, core samples and samples of debris were obtained from the corium layers on the bottom of the reactor vessel and analyzed.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the IAEA, the Three Mile Island accident was a significant turning point in the global development of nuclear power.[71] From 1963ÿ1979, the number of reactors under construction globally increased every year except 1971 and 1978. However, following the event, the number of reactors under construction in the U.S. declined every year from 1980ÿ1998.[citation needed] Many similar Babcock & Wilcox reactors on order were canceled; in total, 51?U.S. nuclear reactors were canceled from 1980ÿ1984.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1979 TMI accident did not initiate the demise of the U.S. nuclear power industry, but it did halt its historic growth. Additionally, as a result of the earlier 1973 oil crisis and post-crisis analysis with conclusions of potential overcapacity in base load, forty planned nuclear power plants already had been canceled before the TMI accident. At the time of the TMI incident, 129 nuclear power plants had been approved, but of those, only 53 (which were not already operating) were completed. During the lengthy review process, complicated by the Chernobyl Disaster seven years later, Federal requirements to correct safety issues and design deficiencies became more stringent, local opposition became more strident, construction times were significantly lengthened and costs skyrocketed.[73]  Until 2012,[74] no U.S. nuclear power plant had been authorized to begin construction since the year before TMI.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlobally, the end of the increase in nuclear power plant construction came with the more catastrophic Chernobyl disaster in 1986 (see graph).\\r\\n\\r\\nThree Mile Island Unit?2 was too badly damaged and contaminated to resume operations; the reactor was gradually deactivated and permanently closed. TMI-2 had been online only 13?months but now had a ruined reactor vessel and a containment building that was unsafe to walk in. Cleanup started in August 1979 and officially ended in December 1993, with a total cleanup cost of about $1?billion.[14] Benjamin K. Sovacool, in his 2007 preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, estimated that the TMI accident caused a total of $2.4?billion in property damages.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, efforts focused on the cleanup and decontamination of the site, especially the defueling of the damaged reactor. Starting in 1985, almost 100 short tons (91?t) of radioactive fuel were removed from the site. The first major phase of the cleanup was completed in 1990, when workers finished shipping 150 short tons (140?t) of radioactive wreckage to Idaho for storage at the Department of Energy's National Engineering Laboratory. However, the contaminated cooling water that leaked into the containment building had seeped into the building's concrete, leaving the radioactive residue too impractical to remove. In 1988, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced that, although it was possible to further decontaminate the Unit?2 site, the remaining radioactivity had been sufficiently contained as to pose no threat to public health and safety. Accordingly, further cleanup efforts were deferred to allow for decay of the radiation levels and to take advantage of the potential economic benefits of retiring both Unit?1 and Unit?2 together.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the accident, investigations focused on the amount of radioactivity released by the accident. In total approximately 2.5 megacuries (93?PBq) of radioactive gases, and approximately 15 curies (560?GBq) of iodine-131 was released into the environment.[76] According to the American Nuclear Society, using the official radioactivity emission figures, \\"The average radiation dose to people living within ten?miles of the plant was eight?millirem, and no more than 100?millirem to any single individual. Eight?millirem is about equal to a chest X-ray, and 100?millirem is about a third of the average background level of radiation received by US residents in a year.\\"[51][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on these emission figures, early scientific publications, according to Mangano, on the health effects of the fallout estimated no additional cancer deaths in the 10?mi (16?km) area around TMI.[52] Disease rates in areas further than 10?miles from the plant were never examined.[52] Local activism in the 1980s, based on anecdotal reports of negative health effects, led to scientific studies being commissioned. A variety of epidemiology studies have concluded that the accident had no observable long term health effects.[8][12][78][79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Radiation and Public Health Project, an organization with little credibility amongst epidemiologists,[80] cited calculations by its member Joseph Mangano?ÿ who has authored 19?medical journal articles and a book on Low Level Radiation and Immune Disease?ÿ that reported a spike in infant mortality in the downwind communities two years after the accident.[52][81] Anecdotal evidence also records effects on the region's wildlife.[52] For example, according to one anti-nuclear activist, Harvey Wasserman, the fallout caused \\"a plague of death and disease among the area's wild animals and farm livestock\\", including a sharp fall in the reproductive rate of the region's horses and cows, reflected in statistics from Pennsylvania's Department of Agriculture, though the Department denies a link with TMI.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Gofman used his own, non-peer reviewed low-level radiation health model to predict 333 excess cancer or leukemia deaths from the 1979 Three Mile Island accident.[7] A peer-reviewed research article by Dr. Steven Wing found a significant increase in cancers from 1979ÿ1985 among people who lived within ten miles of TMI;[83] in 2009 Dr. Wing stated that radiation releases during the accident were probably \\"thousands of times greater\\" than the NRC's estimates. A retrospective study of Pennsylvania Cancer Registry found an increased incidence of thyroid cancer in counties south of TMI and in high-risk age groups but did not draw a causal link with these incidences and to the accident.[9][10] The Talbott lab at the University of Pittsburgh reported finding only a few, small, mostly statistically non-significant, increased cancer risks within the TMI population, such as a non-significant excess leukemia among males being observed.[11] The ongoing TMI epidemiological research has been accompanied by a discussion of problems in dose estimates due to a lack of accurate data, as well as illness classifications.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe TMI accident enhanced the credibility of anti-nuclear groups, who had predicted an accident,[85] and triggered protests around the world.[86] (President Carterwho had specialized in nuclear power while in the United States Navytold his cabinet after visiting the plant that the accident was minor, but reportedly declined to do so in public in order to avoid offending left-wing Democrats who opposed nuclear power.[87])\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of the American public, concerned about the release of radioactive gas from the accident, staged numerous anti-nuclear demonstrations across the country in the following months. The largest demonstration was held in New York City in September 1979 and involved 200,000?people, with speeches given by Jane Fonda and Ralph Nader.[88][89][90] The New York rally was held in conjunction with a series of nightly \\"No Nukes\\" concerts given at Madison Square Garden from September 19ÿ23 by Musicians United for Safe Energy. In the previous May, an estimated 65,000?people?ÿ including California Governor Jerry Brown?ÿ attended a march and rally against nuclear power in Washington, D.C.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1981, citizens' groups succeeded in a class action suit against TMI, winning $25?million in an out-of-court settlement. Part of this money was used to found the TMI Public Health Fund.[91] In 1983, a federal grand jury indicted Metropolitan Edison on criminal charges for the falsification of safety test results prior to the accident.[92] Under a plea-bargaining agreement, Met Ed pleaded guilty to one count of falsifying records and no contest to six other charges, four of which were dropped, and agreed to pay a $45,000?fine and set up a $1?million account to help with emergency planning in the area surrounding the plant.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Eric Epstein, chair of Three Mile Island Alert, the TMI plant operator and its insurers paid at least $82?million in publicly documented compensation to residents for \\"loss of business revenue, evacuation expenses and health claims\\".[94] Also according to Harvey Wasserman, hundreds of out-of-court settlements have been reached with alleged victims of the fallout, with a total of $15?million paid out to parents of children born with birth defects.[95] However, a class action lawsuit alleging that the accident caused detrimental health effects was rejected by Harrisburg U.S. District Court Judge Sylvia Rambo. The appeal of the decision to U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals also failed.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Three Mile Island accident inspired Charles Perrow's Normal Accident Theory, in which an accident occurs, resulting from an unanticipated interaction of multiple failures in a complex system. TMI was an example of this type of accident because it was \\"unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable.\\"[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nPerrow concluded that the failure at Three Mile Island was a consequence of the system's immense complexity. Such modern high-risk systems, he realized, were prone to failures however well they were managed. It was inevitable that they would eventually suffer what he termed a 'normal accident'. Therefore, he suggested, we might do better to contemplate a radical redesign, or if that was not possible, to abandon such technology entirely.[98] \\r\\n\\"Normal\\" accidents, or system accidents, are so-called by Perrow because such accidents are inevitable in extremely complex systems. Given the characteristic of the system involved, multiple failures which interact with each other will occur, despite efforts to avoid them.[99]  Such events appear trivial to begin with before unpredictably cascading through the system creates a large event with severe consequences.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nNormal Accidents contributed key concepts to a set of intellectual developments in the 1980s that revolutionized the conception of safety and risk. It made the case for examining technological failures as the product of highly interacting systems, and highlighted organizational and management factors as the main causes of failures. Technological disasters could no longer be ascribed to isolated equipment malfunction, operator error or acts of God.[98] \\r\\nFollowing the Three Mile Island (TMI) power plant's partial core melt on March 28, 1979, President Jimmy Carter commissioned a study, Report of the President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island (1979).[101] Subsequently, Admiral Hyman G. Rickover was asked to testify before Congress in the general context of answering the question as to why naval nuclear propulsion (as used in submarines) had succeeded in achieving a record of zero reactor-accidents (as defined by the uncontrolled release of fission products to the environment resulting from damage to a reactor core) as opposed to the dramatic one that had just taken place at Three Mile Island. In his testimony, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the years, many people have asked me how I run the Naval Reactors Program, so that they might find some benefit for their own work. I am always chagrined at the tendency of people to expect that I have a simple, easy gimmick that makes my program function. Any successful program functions as an integrated whole of many factors. Trying to select one aspect as the key one will not work. Each element depends on all the others.[102]\\r\\nOn March 16, 1979, twelve days before the accident, the movie The China Syndrome premiered, and was initially met with backlash from the nuclear power industry, claiming it to be \\"sheer fiction\\" and a \\"character assassination of an entire industry.\\"[103] In the film, television reporter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her cameraman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) secretly filmed a major accident at a nuclear power plant while taping a series on nuclear power. Plant supervisor Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) discovers potentially catastrophic safety violations at the plant and with Wells' assistance attempts to raise public awareness of these violations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the release of the film, Fonda began lobbying against nuclear power. In an attempt to counter her efforts, the then elderly Edward Teller, a nuclear physicist and long-time government science adviser best known for contributing to the Teller-Ulam design breakthrough that made hydrogen bombs possible, personally lobbied in favor of nuclear power.[104] Teller suffered a heart attack shortly after the incident and joked that he was the only person whose health was affected.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnit?1 had its license temporarily suspended following the incident at Unit?2. Although the citizens of the three counties surrounding the site voted by an overwhelming margin to retire Unit?1 permanently in a non-binding resolution in 1982, it was permitted to resume operations in 1985 following a 4-1 vote by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.[106][107] General Public Utilities Corporation, the plant's owner, formed General Public Utilities Nuclear Corporation (GPUN) as a new subsidiary to own and operate the company's nuclear facilities, including Three Mile Island. The plant had previously been operated by Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed), one of GPU's regional utility operating companies. In 1996, General Public Utilities shortened its name to GPU Inc. Three Mile Island Unit?1 was sold to AmerGen Energy Corporation, a joint venture between Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO), and British Energy, in 1998. In 2000, PECO merged with Unicom Corporation to form Exelon Corporation, which acquired British Energy's share of AmerGen in 2003. Today, AmerGen LLC is a fully owned subsidiary of Exelon Generation and owns TMI Unit?1, Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, and Clinton Power Station. These three units, in addition to Exelon's other nuclear units, are operated by Exelon Nuclear Inc., an Exelon subsidiary.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Public Utilities was legally obliged to continue to maintain and monitor the site, and therefore retained ownership of Unit?2 when Unit?1 was sold to AmerGen in 1998. GPU Inc. was acquired by FirstEnergy Corporation in 2001, and subsequently dissolved. FirstEnergy then contracted out the maintenance and administration of Unit?2 to AmerGen. Unit?2 has been administered by Exelon Nuclear since 2003, when Exelon Nuclear's parent company, Exelon, bought out the remaining shares of AmerGen, inheriting FirstEnergy's maintenance contract. Unit?2 continues to be licensed and regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in a condition known as Post Defueling Monitored Storage (PDMS).[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe TMI-2 reactor has been permanently shut down with the reactor coolant system drained, the radioactive water decontaminated and evaporated, radioactive waste shipped off-site, reactor fuel and core debris shipped off-site to a Department of Energy facility, and the remainder of the site  being monitored. The owner planned to keep the facility in long-term, monitoring storage until the operating license for the TMI-1 plant expired, at which time both plants would be decommissioned.[15] In 2009, the NRC granted a license extension which allowed the TMI-1 reactor to operate until April 19, 2034.[109][110]\\r\\nIn 2017 it was announced that operations would cease by 2019   due to financial pressure from cheap natural gas.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 400912N 764331W? / ?40.153293N 76.72534W? / 40.153293; -76.72534","input":"When did the three mile island accident happen?"},{"output":"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs","context":"","input":"What was disney's 1930 first feature- length animation?"},{"output":"Donatello","context":"Renaissance art is the painting, sculpture and decorative arts of the period of European history , emerging as a distinct style in Italy in about 1400, in parallel with developments which occurred in philosophy, literature, music, and science. Renaissance art, perceived as the noblest of ancient traditions, took as its foundation the art of Classical antiquity, but transformed that tradition by absorbing recent developments in the art of Northern Europe and by applying contemporary scientific knowledge. Renaissance art, with Renaissance Humanist philosophy, spread throughout Europe, affecting both artists and their patrons with the development of new techniques and new artistic sensibilities. Renaissance art marks the transition of Europe from the medieval period to the Early Modern age.\\r\\nIn many parts of Europe, Early Renaissance art was created in parallel with Late Medieval art.\\r\\nThe influences upon the development of Renaissance men and women in the early 15th century are those that also affected Philosophy, Literature, Architecture, Theology, Science, Government, and other aspects of society. The following list presents a summary, dealt with more fully in the main articles that are cited above.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Italy in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, the sculpture of Nicola Pisano and his son Giovanni Pisano, working at Pisa, Siena and Pistoia shows markedly classicising tendencies, probably influenced by the familiarity of these artists with ancient Roman sarcophagi. Their masterpieces are the pulpits of the Baptistery and Cathedral of Pisa.\\r\\nContemporary with Giovanni Pisano, the Florentine painter Giotto developed a manner of figurative painting that was unprecedentedly naturalistic, three-dimensional, lifelike and classicist, when compared with that of his contemporaries and teacher Cimabue. Giotto, whose greatest work is the cycle of the Life of Christ at the Arena Chapel in Padua, was seen by the 16th century biographer Giorgio Vasari as \\"rescuing and restoring art\\" from the \\"crude, traditional, Byzantine style\\" prevalent in Italy in the 13th century.\\r\\nThe painters of the Low Countries at this period included Jan van Eyck, his brother Hubert van Eyck, Robert Campin, Hans Memling, Rogier van der Weyden and Hugo van der Goes. Their painting developed independently of Early Italian Renaissance painting, and without the influence of a deliberate and conscious striving to revive antiquity. The style of painting grew directly out of the Medieval arts of tempera painting, stained glass and book illumination. The media used was oil paint, which had long been utilised for painting leather ceremonial shields and accoutrements, because it was flexible and relatively durable. The earliest Netherlandish oil paintings are meticulous and detailed like tempera paintings. The material lent itself to the depiction of tonal variations and texture, so facilitating the observation of nature in great detail.\\r\\nThe Netherlandish painters did not approach the creation of a picture through a framework of linear perspective and correct proportion. They maintained a Medieval view of hierarchical proportion and religious symbolism, while delighting in a realistic treatment of material elements, both natural and man-made. Jan van Eyck, with his brother Hubert painted The Altarpiece of the Mystical Lamb. It is probable that Antonello da Messina became familiar with Van Eyck's work, while in Naples or Sicily. In 1475, Hugo van der Goes' Portinari Altarpiece arrived in Florence where it was to have a profound influence on many painters, most immediately Domenico Ghirlandaio who painted an altarpiece imitating its elements.\\r\\nAlthough both the Pisanos and Giotto had students and followers, the first truly Renaissance artists were not to emerge in Florence until 1401 with the competition to sculpt a set of bronze doors of the Baptistery of Florence Cathedral which drew entries from seven young sculptors including Brunelleschi, Donatello and the winner, Lorenzo Ghiberti. Brunelleschi, most famous as the architect of the dome of Florence Cathedral and the Church of San Lorenzo, created a number of sculptural works, including a lifesized Crucifix in Santa Maria Novella, renowned for its naturalism. His studies of perspective are thought to have influenced the painter Masaccio. Donatello became renowned as the greatest sculptor of the Early Renaissance, his masterpieces being his Humanist and unusually erotic statue of David, one of the icons of the Florentine republic, and his great monument to Gattamelata, the first large equestrian bronze to be created since Roman times.\\r\\nThe contemporary of Donatello, Masaccio, was the painterly descendant of Giotto, furthering the trend towards solidity of form and naturalism of face and gesture that he had begun a century earlier. Masaccio completed several panel paintings but is best known for the fresco cycle that he began in the Brancacci Chapel with the older artist Masolino and which had profound influence on later painters, including Michelangelo. Masaccio's developments were carried forward in the paintings of Fra Angelico, particularly in his frescos at the Convent of San Marco in Florence.\\r\\nThe treatment of the elements of perspective and light in painting was of particular concern to 15th-century Florentine painters. Uccello was so obsessed with trying to achieve an appearance of perspective that, according to Vasari, it disturbed his sleep. His solutions can be seen in his masterpiece, the Battle of San Romano. Piero della Francesca made systematic and scientific studies of both light and linear perspective, the results of which can be seen in his fresco cycle of The History of the True Cross in San Francesco, Arezzo.\\r\\nIn Naples, the painter Antonello da Messina began using oil paints for portraits and religious paintings at a date that preceded other Italian painters, possibly about 1450. He carried this technique north and influenced the painters of Venice. One of the most significant painters of Northern Italy was Andrea Mantegna, who decorated the interior of a room, the Camera degli Sposi for his patron Ludovico Gonzaga, setting portraits of the family and court into an illusionistic architectural space.\\r\\nThe end of the Early Renaissance in Italian art is marked, like its beginning, by a particular commission that drew artists together, this time in cooperation rather than competition. Pope Sixtus IV had rebuilt the Papal Chapel, named the Sistine Chapel in his honour, and commissioned a group of artists, Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Rosselli to decorate its wall with fresco cycles depicting the Life of Christ and the Life of Moses. In the sixteen large paintings, the artists, although each working in his individual style, agreed on principals of format, and utilised the techniques of lighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, anatomy, foreshortening and characterisation that had been carried to a high point in the large Florentine studios of Ghiberti, Verrocchio, Ghirlandaio and Perugino.\\r\\nThe artists of France, (including duchies such as Burgundy) were often associated with courts, providing illuminated manuscripts and portraits for the nobility as well as devotional paintings and altarpieces. Among the most famous were the Limbourg brothers, Flemish illuminators and creators of the Trs Riches Heures du Duc de Berry. Jean Fouquet, painter of the royal court, visited Italy in 1437 and reflects the influence of Florentine painters such as Paolo Uccello. Although best known for his portraits such as that of Charles VII of France Fouquet also created illuminations, and is thought to be the inventor of the portrait miniature. There were a number of artists at this date who painted famed altarpieces, that are stylistically quite distinct from both the Italian and the Flemish. These include two enigmatic figures, Enguerrand Quarton to whom is ascribed the Pieta of Villeneuve-ls-Avignon, and Jean Hey, otherwise known as \\"the Master of Moulins\\" after his most famous work, the Moulins Altarpiece. In these works realism and close observation of the human figure, emotions and lighting are combined with a Medieval formality, which includes gilt backgrounds.\\r\\nThe \\"universal genius\\" Leonardo da Vinci was to further perfect the aspects of pictorial art (lighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, anatomy, foreshortening and characterisation) that had preoccupied artists of the Early Renaissance, in a lifetime of studying and meticulously recording his observations of the natural world. His adoption of oil paint as his primary media meant that he could depict light and its effects on the landscape and objects more naturally and with greater dramatic effect than had ever been done before, as demonstrated in the Mona Lisa. His dissection of cadavers carried forward the understanding of skeletal and muscular anatomy, as seen in the unfinished St Jerome. His depiction of human emotion in The Last Supper set the benchmark for religious painting.\\r\\nThe art of Leonardo's younger contemporary Michelangelo took a very different direction. Michelangelo, in neither his painting nor his sculpture demonstrates any interest in the observation of any natural object except the human body. He perfected his technique in depicting it, while in his early twenties, by the creation of the enormous marble statue of David and the group the Pieta, in St Peter's Basilica, Rome. He then set about an exploration of the expressive possibilities of the human anatomy. His commission by Pope Julius II to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling resulted in the supreme masterpiece of figurative composition, which was to have profound effect on every subsequent generation of European artists.\\r\\nStanding alongside Leonardo and Michelangelo as the third great painter of the High Renaissance was the younger Raphael, who in a short life span painted a great number of lifelike and engaging portraits, including those of Pope Julius II and his successor Pope Leo X, and numerous portrayals of the Madonna and Christ Child, including the Sistine Madonna.\\r\\nIn Northern Italy the High Renaissance represented by the religious paintings of Giovanni Bellini which include several large altarpieces of a type known as \\"Sacred Conversation\\" which show a group of saints around the enthroned Madonna. His contemporary Giorgione left a small number of enigmatic works, including The Tempest, the subject of which has remained a matter of speculation. The earliest works of Titian date from the era of the High Renaissance, including a massive altarpiece The Assumption of the Virgin which combines human action and drama with spectacular colour and atmosphere.\\r\\nGerman Renaissance art falls into the broader category of the Renaissance in Northern Europe, also known as the Northern Renaissance. Renaissance influences began to appear in German art in the 15th century, but this trend was not widespread. Gardner's Art Through the Ages identifies Michael Pacher, a painter and sculptor, as the first German artist whose work begins to show Italian Renaissance influences. According to that source, Pacher's painting, St. Wolfgang Forces the Devil to Hold His Prayerbook (c.1481), is Late Gothic in style, but also shows the influence of the Italian artist, Mantegna.[4] Artisans, such as engravers, became more concerned with aesthetics rather than just perfecting their craft. Germany had master engravers, such as Martin Schongauer, who did metal engravings in the late 1400s. Gardner relates this mastery of the graphic arts to advances in printing which occurred in Germany, and says that metal engraving began to replace the woodcut during the Renaissance.[5] However, some artists, such as Albrecht Drer, continued to do woodcuts. Both Gardner and Russell describe the fine quality of Drer's woodcuts, with Russell stating, in The World of Drer, that Drer \\"elevated them into high works of art.\\"[6]\\r\\nIn the 1500s, Renaissance art in Germany became more common as, according to Gardner, \\"The art of northern Europe during the sixteenth century is characterized by a sudden awareness of the advances made by the Italian Renaissance and by a desire to assimilate this new style as rapidly as possible.\\"[7] One of the best known practitioners of German Renaissance art was Albrecht Drer (1471ÿ1528). Drer's fascination with classical ideas led him to Italy to study art. Both Gardner and Russell recognized the importance of Durer's contribution to German art in bringing Italian Renaissance styles and ideas to Germany.[6][8] Russell calls this \\"Opening the Gothic windows of German art,\\"[6] while Gardner calls it Drer's \\"life mission.\\"[8] Importantly, as Gardner points out, Drer \\"was the first northern artist who fully understood the basic aims of the southern Renaissance,\\"[8] although his style did not always reflect that. The same source says that Hans Holbein the Younger (1497ÿ1543) successfully assimilated Italian ideas while also keeping \\"northern traditions of close realism.\\"[9] This is contrasted against Drer's tendency to work in \\"his own native German style\\"[8] instead of combining German and Italian styles. Other important artists of the German Renaissance were Grnewald, Albrecht Altdorfer, and Lucas Cranach the Elder.[10]\\r\\nHieronymus Bosch was a painter of the Netherlands, who employed the type of fanciful forms that were often utilized to decorate borders and letters in illuminated manuscripts, combining plant and animal forms with architectonic ones. When taken from the context of the illumination and peopled with humans, these forms give Bosch's paintings a surreal quality which have no parallel in the work of any other Renaissance painter. His masterpiece is the triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights.\\r\\nBritain was very late to late to develop a Renaissance style and most artists of the Tudor court were imported foreigners, usually from the Low countries, including Hans Holbein the Younger, who died in England. One exception was the portrait miniature, which artists including Nicholas Hilliard developed into a distinct genre, well before it became popular in the rest of Europe. Renaissance art in Scotland was similarly dependent on imported artists, and largely restricted to the court.\\r\\nRenaissance artists painted a wide variety of themes. Religious altarpieces, fresco cycles, and small works for private devotion were very popular. For inspiration, painters in both Italy and northern Europe frequently turned to Jacobus de Voragine's Golden Legend (1260), a highly influential source book for the lives of saints that had already had a strong influence on Medieval artists. The rebirth of classical antiquity and Renaissance humanism also resulted in many Mythological and history paintings. Ovidian stories, for example, were very popular. Decorative ornament, often used in painted architectural elements, was especially influenced by classical Roman motifs.\\r\\nMain articles: Early Netherlandish painting for 15th-century artists, Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting for 16th-century artists","input":"Who was the first major figure of the renaissance art movement?"},{"output":"twice as fast at the loop of the whip","context":"Whipcracking is the act of producing a cracking sound through the use of a whip. Used during livestock driving and horse riding, it has also become an art. A rhythmic whipcracking  belongs to the traditional culture among various Germanic peoples of Bavaria (Goa?lschnalzen), various Alpine areas (Aperschnalzen), Austria, and Hungary (Ostorozs).  Today it is a performing art, a part of rodeo show in United States, a competitive sport in Australia and increasingly popular in the United Kingdom, where it crosses boundaries of sport, hobby and performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crack a whip makes is produced when a section of the whip moves faster than the speed of sound creating a small sonic boom. The creation of the sonic boom was confirmed in 1958 [1] by analyzing the high-speed shadow photography taken in 1927.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently, an additional, purely geometrical factor was recognized: the tip of the whip moves twice as fast at the loop of the whip, just like the top of a car's wheel moves twice as fast as the car itself.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nA common explanation is to derive the behavior from the conservation of energy law. However it was noted that the energy is also conserved when the crack sizzles, therefore derivations from purely conservation laws, including conservation of momentum and some others are insufficient.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on simulations, the high speed of the tip of the whip has been proposed to be a result of a \\"chain reaction of levers and blocks\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997 the Discover Magazine reported about the possibility of the \\"whipcracking\\" effect millions of years ago. As part of the joint computer scientists' and paleontologists' research into the motion of dinosaurs, Nathan Myhrvold, a chief technology officer from Microsoft, carried out a computer simulation of an apatosaurus, which has a very long, tapering tail resembling a whip. Basing on the reasoning described above, Myhrvold concluded that sauropods were capable of producing a crack comparable to the sound of a cannon.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoa?lschnalzen, Goa?lschnalzn, Goasslschnoizen is translated as \\"whip-cracking\\", from the Bavarian word Goa?l (German: Gei?el) for coachwhip. In earlier centuries, the carriage drivers used elaborate crack sequences to signal their approach and to identify them. Over time horse-drawn transport dwindled, but the tradition remained, and coaches practiced their skill in their spare time.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday the Goa?lschnalzer (\\"whipsnappers\\") do concert performances, often as bands that include conventional musical instruments. Whipsnapping is also a traditional sport in Bavaria. There are many whip-cracking associations in Bavaria.\\r\\n\\r\\nAperschnalzen or Apaschnoizn in Bavarian is an old tradition of competitive whipcracking revived in the first half of the 20th century. The word \\"aper\\" means \\"area free of snow\\", and it has been thought that this tradition had a pagan meaning of \\"driving the winter away\\" by whipcracking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British Whipcracking Convention is a place for all who are interested in whip cracking. This ranges from complete novices who have never picked up a whip, through intermediate skills to expert skill sharing. There are workshops for the differing skill levels as well as competitions and targets. The third convention was  held in Aldersley Leisure Village, Aldersley Road, Wolverhampton on 14 July 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, attempts to preserve traditional crafts, along with a resurgence of interest in Western performance arts and the release of films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark (in which the hero, Indiana Jones, uses a bullwhip as a tool), led to an increased interest in whipcracking as a hobby and performance art, as well as a competitive sport.  Whip cracking competitions have become especially popular in Australia. They focus on the completion of complex, multiple-cracking routines and precise target work. Various whips, apart from bullwhips, are used in such competitions.  The most common whip used in Australian competitions is an Australian stockwhip, a whip unique to Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn cracking routines, the judging criteria are the presentation and making audible cracks in prescribed moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1986  an Australian whip-cracker Gary Brophy managed to crack a giant whip for the Guinness Book of Records. the whip measured a staggering 42?m (140?ft) in length.\\r\\nGary and his family now tour the world performing their wild west act in circuses and rodeos.","input":"How fast is the tip of a whip?"},{"output":"by 1867","context":"Wild rabbits are a serious mammalian pest and invasive species in Australia causing millions of dollars of damage to crops. Rabbits in Australia are European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in the Lagomorph family.\\r\\nThey were introduced to Australia in the 18th century with the First Fleet and eventually became widespread, probably through the emergence of strong crossbreeds. Various methods in the 20th century have been attempted to control the population. Conventional methods include shooting rabbits and destroying their warrens, but these had only limited success. In 1907, a rabbit-proof fence was built in Western Australia in an unsuccessful attempt to contain the rabbits. The myxoma virus, which causes myxomatosis, was introduced into the rabbit population in the 1950s and had the effect of severely reducing the rabbit population. However, the survivors have since adapted and partially recovered their previous numbers.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRabbits were introduced to Australia by the First Fleet in 1788.[2] They were bred as food animals, probably in cages. In the first decades, they do not appear to have been numerous, judging from their absence from archaeological collections of early colonial food remains. However, by 1827 in Tasmania, a newspaper article noted \\"...the common rabbit is becoming so numerous throughout the colony, that they are running about on some large estates by thousands. We understand, that there are no rabbits whatever in the elder colony\\" i.e., New South Wales.[3] This clearly shows a localised rabbit population explosion was underway in Tasmania in the early 19th century. At the same time in NSW, Cunningham noted, \\"... rabbits are bred around houses, but we have yet no wild ones in enclosures...\\" He also noted the scrubby, sandy soil between Sydney and Botany Bay would be ideal for farming rabbits.[4] Enclosures appear to mean more extensive rabbit-farming warrens, rather than cages. The first of these, in Sydney at least, was one built by Alexander Macleay at Elizabeth Bay House, \\"a preserve or rabbit-warren, surrounded by a substantial stone wall, and well stocked with that choice game.\\"[5] In the 1840s, rabbit-keeping became even more common, with examples of the theft of rabbits from ordinary peoples' houses appearing in court records and rabbits entering the diets of ordinary people.\\r\\nIn 1857ÿ1858 Alexander Buchanan, overseer for F. H. Dutton's Anlaby Estate in the Mid-North of South Australia, released a number of rabbits for hunting sport. Their population remained fairly stable until around 1866, presumed to have been kept in check by native carnivores and were protected by an Act of Parliament, but by 1867 was out of control.[6] The population explosion was ascribed to the disappearance of native predators, but is easily explained by the emergence of a hardier breed by natural selection.\\r\\nThe current infestation appears to have originated with the release of 24 wild rabbits[7] by Thomas Austin for hunting purposes in October 1859, on his property, Barwon Park, near Winchelsea, Victoria. While living in England, Austin had been an avid hunter, regularly dedicating his weekends to rabbit shooting. Upon arriving in Australia, which had no native rabbit population, Austin asked his nephew William Austin in England to send him twelve grey rabbits, five hares, seventy-two partridges and some sparrows so he could continue his hobby in Australia by creating a local population of the species. William could not source enough grey rabbits to meet his uncle's order, so he topped it up by buying domestic rabbits. One theory as to why the Barwon Park rabbits adapted so well to Australia is that the hybrid rabbits that resulted from the interbreeding of the two distinct types were much more suited to Australian conditions.[8] Many other farms released their rabbits into the wild after Austin.\\r\\nAt the time he had stated, \\"The introduction of a few rabbits could do little harm and might provide a touch of home, in addition to a spot of hunting.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe rabbits were extremely prolific creatures and spread rapidly across the southern parts of the country. Australia had ideal conditions for a rabbit population explosion. With mild winters, rabbits were able to breed the entire year. With widespread farming, areas that might otherwise have been scrub or woodlands were instead turned into vast areas with low vegetations, creating ideal habitats for rabbits.\\r\\nIn a classic example of unintended consequences, rabbits had become so prevalent within ten years of their introduction in 1859 that two million could be shot or trapped annually without having any noticeable effect on the population. It was the fastest spread ever recorded of any mammal anywhere in the world. Today, rabbits are entrenched in the southern and central areas of the country, with scattered populations in the northern deserts.\\r\\nAlthough the rabbit is a notorious pest, it proved useful to many people during the depressions of the 1890s and 1930s and during wartime. Trapping rabbits helped farmers, stockmen, and stationhands by providing food and extra income, and in some cases helped pay off farming debts. Rabbits were fed to working dogs and boiled to be fed to poultry. Later, frozen rabbit carcasses were traded locally and exported. Pelts, too, were used in the fur trade and are still used in the felt-hat industry.[10]\\r\\nSince their introduction from Europe in the 19th century, the effect of rabbits on the ecology of Australia has been devastating. They are suspected of being the most significant known factor in species loss in Australia.[citation needed] Rabbits are believed to have had an immense impact on the abundance of natural resource availability, primarily concerning overgrazing. The rabbits would first deplete the natural pasture vegetation, and would then resort to consuming woody-vegetation, which included small shrubs, and the leaves and bark of trees. [11]The extent of plant species' loss is unknown at this time though it is known that rabbits often kill young trees in orchards, forests, and on properties by ringbarking them.[10]\\r\\nRabbits are also responsible for serious erosion problems, as they eat native plants, leaving the topsoil exposed and vulnerable to sheet, gully, and wind erosion. The removal of this topsoil is devastating to the land, as it takes many hundreds of years to regenerate.[12]\\r\\nBy 1887, losses from rabbit damage compelled the New South Wales Government to offer a S25,000 reward for \\"any method of success not previously known in the Colony for the effectual extermination of rabbits\\".[13] The Commission received 1456 suggestions, including several schemes involving biological controls (see below), but none was found both safe and effective.[14]\\r\\nA Royal Commission was held to investigate the situation in 1901. Once the problem was understood, various control methods were tried to limit or reduce the population of rabbits in Australia. These methods had limited success until the introduction of biological control methods in the latter half of the 20th century.\\r\\nShooting rabbits is one of the most common control methods and can successfully be used to keep already low populations in check whilst providing food for people or pets, though large scale eradication requires different means.\\r\\nDestroying warrens through ripping (a procedure wherein rabbits are dismembered or buried alive as a bulldozer dragging sharp tines is driven over their warrens/burrows),[15] ploughing, blasting, and fumigating is widely used, especially on large farms (known as \\"stations\\"). The sandy soil in many parts of Australia makes ripping and ploughing a viable method of control, and both tractors and bulldozers are used for this operation.\\r\\nPoisoning is probably the most widely used of the conventional techniques, as it requires the least effort, and capable of destroying a local population, though of course re-infestation by the highly mobile pest is almost inevitable. Laying baits of pollard laced with a phosphorus-based poison, such as \\"S.A.P.\\" manufactured by Sayers, Allport & Potter, was an early method. The advantage of phosphorus is that in dry weather, assuming it has not been laid in clumps (obviated by use of a poison cart), it soon degrades to innocuous phosphoric acid and presents no further danger to livestock or pets. It does, however, present a real fire risk, and concentrated fumes can be toxic to operators.[16] More modern poisons for rabbit control are sodium fluoroacetate (\\"1080\\") and pindone.[17]\\r\\nAnother technique is hunting using ferrets, wherein ferrets are deployed to chase the rabbits out to be shot or into nets set over the burrows. Since the number of rabbits ferrets can kill is limited,[18] this is more a hunting activity than a serious control method. Although, ferrets and other mustelid species are used as a control measure, Australia has significantly less wild mustelids to prey on the invasive rabbits than other countries, such as Europe and America, while in their warrens or burrows contributing to rabbit success.?[19]\\r\\nHistorically, trapping was also frequently used; steel-jawed leg-holding traps were banned in most states in the 1980s on animal cruelty grounds, though trapping continues at a lower level using rubber-jawed traps. All of these techniques are limited to working only in settled areas and are quite labour-intensive.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1893, a rabbit-proof fence was commenced in Queensland. It was progressively extended through the years. In 1997, a final segment was built connecting it to the Dingo Fence. It extends from Mount Gipps (near Rathdowney) to Goombi between Chinchilla and Miles.[20]\\r\\nIn 1907, the rabbit-proof fence was built in Western Australia between Cape Keraudren and Esperance to try to control the spread of the rabbit population from the east into Western Australian pastoral areas. However, since European rabbits can both jump very high and burrow underground,[21] even a perfectly intact fence stretching for hundreds of kilometres, and whose gates farmers or graziers did not leave open for livestock or machinery, would not likely succeed.[citation needed]As an example the Number 1 Rabbit-Proof Fence, which was erected in 1901, failed to keep the rabbit population away from the protected area.[22] Even after this large scale fence had failed, smaller scale fencing projects continued to make a successful appearance.[23]\\r\\nReleasing rabbit-borne diseases has proven somewhat successful in controlling the population of rabbits in Australia, but what success has been achieved did not occur as quickly as was hoped.\\r\\nThe NSW government's offer of a S25,000 reward attracted the attention of Louis Pasteur, who proposed using the chicken cholera bacillus (now known as Pasteurella multocida), and while this measure was not proven viable, the association with Pasteur accelerated the introduction of microbiology into Australia.[24]\\r\\nOn 16 April 1888 the NSW Government appointed a Royal Commission \\"to make a full and diligent inquiry as to whether or not the introduction of contagious diseases amongst rabbits by inoculation or otherwise, or the propagation of diseases natural to rabbits ... will be accompanied or followed by danger to human health or life, or to animal life other than rabbits, or to interfere injuriously with the profitable carrying on of agricultural or pastoral pursuits ...\\" Under the aegis of the Commission, tests were conducted at Rodd Island, but it was proved that although rabbits who ingested food adulterated with chicken cholera virus were killed, there was no evidence of the contagion spreading to healthy rabbits.[14]\\r\\nIn 1885 Professor Watson of Adelaide University suggested releasing rabbits inoculated with rabbit scab into an enclosed trial area.[25][26] Limited trials proved however that this measure would be ineffective in the drier parts of the continent.\\r\\nIn September 1887, Dr Herbert Butcher (1854ÿ1893) of Wilcannia found at Tintinallogy Station a number of dead emaciated rabbits, which he and Dr H. Ellis of Sydney concluded had died of a novel disease which they dubbed Tintinallogy virus, and could be an effective control measure. Unfortunately whatever they died from was never proved to be infectious or contagious?; it may have been simple starvation caused by natural elements.[14]\\r\\nIn 1906 and 1907 Jean Danysz, of the Pasteur Institute of Paris, conducted trials on Broughton Island, New South Wales of a strain of Pasteurella bacteria he had developed, which proved to be specific to rabbits but less than satisfactory as a control measure. Dr Danysz considered that Broughton Island was a poor choice and that extensive experiments should be conducted on the mainland. Frank Tidswell, who was his chief Australian collaborator, continued Danysz's trials after he left in 1907, also began trials of the Yalgogrin, Gundagai and Picton microbes (named for the stations where infected rabbits were found). But the financial support that would be necessary from the Federal government (or collaboration of affected States) to prove it safe and effective was lacking. The fact that these pathogens did not wipe out whole populations might have raised doubts as to their efficacy.[27]\\r\\nIn 1950, after research was conducted by Frank Fenner, myxoma virus was deliberately released into the rabbit population, causing it to drop from an estimated 600 million[28] to around 100 million. Genetic resistance in the remaining rabbits allowed the population to recover to 200ÿ300 million by 1991.\\r\\nTo combat this trend, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) comprehensively tested, over three years from June 1991, the release of calicivirus to cause rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD).[29] The virus escaped from a quarantine compound on Wardang Island, South Australia, where field tests were being carried out on the potential of the virus for biological control of wild rabbits, and by late October 1995 it was recorded in rabbits at Yunta and Gum Creek, in northeastern South Australia.[30] By the winter of 1996, the virus was established in Victoria, New South Wales, the Northern Territory and Western Australia.[31] The virus was discovered in these area by analyzing livers of deceased rabbits. The success of the virus was found to be higher in dry areas, because of a benign calicivirus found in the colder, wetter areas of Australia, which was immunizing rabbits against the more virulent form.[32]\\r\\nA legal vaccine exists in Australia for RHD. There is no cure for either myxomatosis or RHD, and many affected pets are euthanised. In Europe, where rabbits are farmed on a large scale, they are protected against myxomatosis and calicivirus with a genetically modified virus.[33] The vaccine was developed in Spain.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe team of virologist Francisco Parra, working with the University of Oviedo, in Asturias, northern Spain identified a new variant of the virus in 2012.[34] The pathogen, a new strain of K5 (RHDV1) causes rabbit haemorrhagic disease and is both extremely lethal and highly contagious.[35] In 2017 it was released by Australian authorities throughout its territory to wipe out its wild rabbit populations. The virus was released at around 600 points on the continent; owners of domestic rabbits were advised to vaccinate their animals.[36]\\r\\nIn southern Europe, the scarcity of rabbits threatens the conservation of predator species higher up the food chain that are endangered and depend on small-game such as rabbits. These include the Iberian lynx and the Iberian imperial eagle. For that reason biological warfare in Australia is a serious concern for conservation experts working in other parts of the world where the preservation of a viable rabbit population is problematic.[37]","input":"When did rabbits become a problem in australia?"},{"output":"Midnight green","context":"National Football League (1933ÿpresent)\\r\\nMidnight green, Silver, Black, White[2][3]\\r\\nLeague championships (4)\\r\\nConference championships (4)\\r\\nDivision championships (13)\\r\\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are a professional American football franchise based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Bell, Chuck Bednarik, Bob Brown, Brian Dawkins, Reggie White, Steve Van Buren, Tommy McDonald, Greasy Neale, Pete Pihos, Sonny Jurgensen, and Norm Van Brocklin have been inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\\r\\nThe team has an intense rivalry with the New York Giants. This rivalry is the oldest in the NFC East and is among the oldest in the NFL. It was ranked by NFL Network as the number one rivalry of all-time and Sports Illustrated ranks it amongst the Top 10 NFL rivalries of all-time at number four,[4] and according to ESPN, it is one of the fiercest and most well-known rivalries in the American football community.[5] They also have a bitter rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys, which has become more high-profile since the 1960s, as well as a historic rivalry with the Washington Redskins. Their rivalry with the Pittsburgh Steelers is another bitter rivalry, roughly dating back to 1933, that mostly arises from the two teams' statuses as being from opposite ends of the same state.[6]\\r\\nThe team consistently ranks in the top three in attendance and has sold out every game since the 1999 season.[7][8] In a Sports Illustrated poll of 321 NFL players, Eagles fans were selected the most intimidating fans in the NFL.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMidway through the 1931 season, the Frankford Yellow Jackets went bankrupt and ceased operations.[10] After more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement, the NFL granted an expansion franchise to a syndicate headed by Bert Bell and Lud Wray and awarded them the franchise rights of the failed Yellow Jackets organization. The Bell-Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3,500 (equal to $40,230 today) and assumed a total debt of $11,000 that was owed to three other NFL franchises.[11] Drawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle insignia of the National Recovery Administrationthe centerpiece of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal[11]Bell and Wray named the new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles. Neither the Eagles nor the NFL officially regard the two franchises as the same, citing the aforementioned period of dormancy. Furthermore, almost no Yellow Jackets players were on the Eagles' first roster. The Eagles, along with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the now-defunct Cincinnati Reds, joined the NFL as expansion teams.\\r\\nIn 1937, the Eagles moved to Shibe Park (renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1954) and played their home games at the stadium through 1957, except for the 1941 season, which was played at Municipal Stadium, where they had played from 1936 to 1939.\\r\\nTo accommodate football at Shibe Park during the winter, management set up stands in right field, parallel to 20th Street. Some 20 feet high, these \\"east stands\\" had 22 rows of seats. The goalposts stood along the first base line and in left field. The uncovered east stands enlarged capacity of Shibe Park to over 39,000, but the Eagles rarely drew more than 25 to 30,000.[12]\\r\\nThe Eagles struggled over the course of their first decade, enduring repeated losing seasons. In December 1940, Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney sold his franchise to Alexis Thompson for $160,000 and then used half of the proceeds to buy a half interest in the Eagles from Bell, his longtime friend.[13] Soon after, Bell and Rooney traded the Eagles franchise to Thompson and moved it to Pittsburgh (as the \\"Steelers\\"), while Thompson moved the Steelers franchise to Philadelphia (as the \\"Eagles\\").[13]\\r\\nIn 1943, when manpower shortages stemming from World War II made it impossible to fill the roster, the team merged with the Pittsburgh Steelers forming the \\"Phil-Pitt Eagles\\" and were known as the \\"Steagles.\\" (The merger, never intended as a permanent arrangement, was dissolved at the end of the 1943 season.) By the late 1940s, head coach Earle \\"Greasy\\" Neale and running back Steve Van Buren led the team to three consecutive NFL Championship Games, winning two of them in 1948 and 1949. Those two championships mark the Eagles as the only NFL team ever to win back-to-back championships by shutouts, defeating the Chicago Cardinals, 7ÿ0, in 1948in a blizzardand the Los Angeles Rams, 14ÿ0, in 1949.\\r\\nAfter the 1957 season, the Eagles moved from Connie Mack Stadium to Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin Field would seat over 60,000 for the Eagles, whereas Connie Mack had a capacity of 39,000.[14] The stadium switched from grass to AstroTurf in 1969. It was the first NFL stadium to use artificial turf.\\r\\nIn 1960, the Eagles won their third NFL championship, under the leadership of future Pro Football Hall of Famers Norm Van Brocklin and Chuck Bednarik; the head coach was Buck Shaw. The 1960 Eagles, by a score of 17ÿ13, became the only team to defeat Vince Lombardi and his Green Bay Packers in the playoffs.\\r\\nThe Eagles had a decent 1961 season and then fell on hard times in 1962. Jerry Wolman, after consulting his longtime friend Brandon Sturrock, bought the franchise in 1963 from the \\"Happy Hundred\\", a group of investors who owned the team from 1949ÿ1963, for $5,505,000 (equal to $44,004,098 today).[14]\\r\\nIn 1969, Leonard Tose bought the Eagles from Wolman for $16,155,000[15] (equal to $107,807,505 today), then a record for a professional sports franchise. Tose's first official act was to fire Coach Joe Kuharich after a disappointing 24ÿ41ÿ1 record during his five-year reign. He followed this by naming former Eagles receiving great Pete Retzlaff as General Manager and Jerry Williams as coach.\\r\\nWith the merger of the NFL and AFL in 1970, the Eagles were placed in the NFC East Division with their archrivals the New York Giants, the Washington Redskins, and the Dallas Cowboys. Their heated rivalry with the Giants is the oldest of the NFC East rivalries, dating all the way back to 1933 and is often named as one of the best rivalries in the NFL.[16][17]\\r\\nIn 1976, Dick Vermeil was hired from UCLA to coach the Eagles, who had only one winning season from 1962ÿ1975.[18] Starting in 1978, head coach Dick Vermeil and quarterback Ron Jaworski led the team to four consecutive playoff appearances.\\r\\nVermeil's 1980 team won their first NFC East title. They were matched up against their hated rival the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC Championship game, which they won 20ÿ7. However, the Eagles lost to the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XV in 1981. The following year, the Eagles were eliminated in the wildcard round at home against the New York Giants. In the aftermath of the disappointing and strike-shortened season of 1982, head coach Dick Vermeil resigned, claiming that he was \\"burned out\\". Vermeil was replaced by defensive coordinator Marion Campbell.\\r\\nIn January 1983, Tose announced that his daughter, Susan Fletcher, the Eagles' vice president and legal counsel, would eventually succeed him as primary owner of the Eagles. Then in 1984, rumors were circulating that Leonard Tose was thinking about moving the team to Phoenix, Arizona due to financial reasons.\\r\\nIn 1985, Tose was forced to sell the Eagles to Norman Braman and Ed Leibowitz, highly successful automobile dealers from Florida, for a reported $65?million (equal to $147,899,134 today) to pay off his more than $25?million (equal to $56,884,282 today) in gambling debts at Atlantic City casinos.\\r\\nPhiladelphia football struggled through the Marion Campbell years of the mid-1980s and was marked by a malaise in fan participation. However, in the 1985 Supplemental draft, the Eagles acquired the rights to Memphis Showboats' elite pass rusher Reggie White. In 1986, the arrival of head coach Buddy Ryan and his fiery attitude rejuvenated team performance and ignited the fan base, but the Eagles failed to win a playoff game during Ryan's tenure. Possibly the worst of these losses was the so-called Fog Bowl in 1988 against the Chicago Bears, which happened to be Ryan's former team that he helped lead to a Super Bowl XX victory as defensive coordinator. Ryan was fired on January 7, 1991, after an upset home playoff loss to the Redskins. Offensive coordinator Rich Kotite was promoted to head coach three days later.\\r\\nAfter All Pro defensive tackle Jerome Brown was killed in an automobile accident, the team and fanbase became dedicated to \\"bring it home for Jerome\\" in the 1992 season. Kotite did lead the Eagles to a playoff victory against the New Orleans Saints during the 1992 season, but they lost all-time sacks leader Reggie White to free agency in the offseason. Kotie's contract was not renewed after a disappointing 1994 season in which the Eagles went 7ÿ9, losing their last seven games after starting the season 7ÿ2. From 1988 to 1996, the Eagles qualified for the playoffs during six out of those nine seasons, but they won the NFC East only once, in 1988. Among the team's offensive stars during that period were quarterback Randall Cunningham, tight end Keith Jackson, and running back Herschel Walker. But the \\"Gang Green\\" defense is possibly what defined the team, led by Reggie White, Jerome Brown, Clyde Simmons, Seth Joyner, Wes Hopkins, Mike Golic, Byron Evans, Eric Allen, Andre Waters and Mark McMillian.\\r\\nJeffrey Lurie bought the Eagles on May 6, 1994 from then-owner Norman Braman for an estimated $185?million. The club is now estimated to be the 17th most valuable sports team, worth $1.314?billion, as valuated in 2014 by Forbes.[19]\\r\\nIn Lurie's first season as owner, the team only had 7 wins, but that was followed by a 10 win season in 1995. Besides the 10 wins and a playoff berth, 1996 was an eventful year. The uniforms changed from the classic shade of Kelly Green to a darker midnight green, quarterback Randall Cunningham left after 11 seasons, and future fan favorite 13-year starter Brian Dawkins was drafted in the 2nd round. After slipping to 6ÿ9ÿ1, and then to 3ÿ13, head coach Ray Rhodes was fired after four seasons.\\r\\nIn 1999, the Eagles hired head coach Andy Reid and drafted quarterback Donovan McNabb. From 1999 until 2004, the team continually improved, going from 5ÿ11 in 1999, returning to the playoffs in with an 11ÿ5 record in 2000, surpassing the Buccaneers in the Wild Card round before losing in the divisional. Moreover, the Eagles played in four straight NFC Championship Games between 2001 and 2004. In 2001, the Eagles stayed at 11ÿ5, beating the Buccaneers and Bears to advance to the NFC championship, where they lost to the St. Louis Rams. In 2002, the Eagles drafted running back Brian Westbrook, got the 1st round bye with the 2nd seed in the NFC with a 12ÿ4 record, but the Tampa Bay Buccaneers got their revenge in the Championship and eliminated the Eagles. In 2003, they won the NFC first seed, but Westbrook went down in Week 17, culminating in a loss to the Carolina Panthers in their 3rd straight NFC Championship.\\r\\nIn 2004, the Philadelphia Eagles had their best season since 1960, going 13ÿ1 before resting their starters and losing their next 2, clinching the 1st seed for the second year in a row. McNabb set career highs, completing 64% of his passes for 3,875 yards, though he didn't play all 16 games. McNabb became the first quarterback ever to throw more than 30 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season. His success could be attributed to the fact that he had a reliable receiver, Terrell Owens, who got 1,200 yards and 14 touchdowns in 14 games. After beating the Vikings and Falcons the Eagles advanced to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they dueled the New England Patriots. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14ÿ14 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles and scored ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left on the clock secured their fate.\\r\\nThe team took a step back in 2005 with a 6ÿ10 record. McNabb had played with a sports hernia and a broken thumb, starting 4ÿ2 but losing three in a row, before McNabb finally succumbs to injury and is out for the rest of the season. For obnoxious behavior and a feud with McNabb, Owens was suspended after 7 games, eventually being cut. In 2006, the team lost McNabb 10 games in and went into turmoil, but Westbrook stepped up, and the Eagles earned their fifth NFC East title under Coach Reid, with a 10ÿ6 record and a win in the wild card round, but they had an 8ÿ8 2007 season. In 2008, the team won their 500th game, and they also drafted DeSean Jackson, a receiving threat when paired with McNabb.[21]\\r\\nOn January 11, 2009, the team defeated the defending Super Bowl champion and 1st seed New York Giants 23ÿ11 en route to their 5th NFC Championship Game in 8 years and 5th in the 10 years the Eagles have been coached by Andy Reid. In the 2008 NFC Championship Game, the Eagles made a rally, going from 24ÿ6 at halftime to 25ÿ24 with three minutes left in the 4th, but they lost to the Arizona Cardinals by a score of 32ÿ25 after quarterback Kurt Warner scored a last minute touchdown. As of the conclusion of the 2016 season, during the Lurie era, the Eagles are 1ÿ4 in conference championship games and 0ÿ1 in Super Bowls.\\r\\nOn August 13, 2009, the Eagles signed quarterback Michael Vick.[22] On December 6, 2009, Andy Reid became only the 5th coach in NFL history to win 100 or more games with a single team in a single decade. The other four are Tom Landry, Don Shula, Tony Dungy, and Bill Belichick, all Super Bowl winners.[23] McNabb finally had a complete receiving corps, between first round draft pick Jeremy Maclin, DeSean Jackson's 1,000 yard season, and Brent Celek ranking among the top 5 tight ends in the league. Without Brian Dawkins, defensive end Trent Cole stepped up and became the dominant force on defense with 12 sacks, earning him his second trip to the Pro Bowl and All-Pro honors. In 2009, the Eagles started 5ÿ4, but moved up to 11ÿ4, and could clinch the NFC 2nd seed if they won their next game. After a shutout at the hands of the Dallas Cowboys in week 17, the Eagles missed the 1st round bye. but with a record of 11ÿ5, but they were the NFC 6th seed and they narrowly made the playoffs. In the 2009 NFC Wild Card Game, the Eagles played against the Cowboys for the second consecutive week and lost 34ÿ14. Despite many errors from many players, and a great season before the breakdown in Dallas, McNabb took the brunt of the blow and was heavily criticized. Coach Andy Reid said up until April 1, 2010, that McNabb would remain the starter.\\r\\nOn March 5, 2010, Brian Westbrook was cut from the Eagles after eight seasons with the team. On April 4, 2010, the team traded long-time starting quarterback Donovan McNabb to the Washington Redskins in exchange for a second round draft pick.[24] Kevin Kolb was immediately named the starter, but after suffering a concussion in week 1 against the Packers, Vick took over as the starter. Vick led the Eagles to its sixth NFC East division title in ten seasons. With a record of 10ÿ6 the Eagles clinched the 3rd seed and had to play a Wild Card Playoff Game. During the 2010 NFC Wild Card Game, the Eagles faced off against the eventual Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers and lost 21ÿ16.\\r\\nThe 2011 season for the Eagles was a major disappointment, as they only managed to finish 8ÿ8 and did not qualify for the playoffs, although they did win the last 4 games of the season. Because of several free agent acquisitions, Vince Young, a back up quarterback, stated that the Eagles were a Dream Team. The Philadelphia fan base and faithful never did concur with the comment as some national outlets may comment. Many Eagles fans believe that Vince Young saying that the Eagles were a 'Dream Team' is the reason that the Eagles had such a horrible season.\\r\\nEagles fans had high expectations going into the 2012 season. The Eagles started off winning three out of their four first games, but that changed when they lost the next eight games, and were eliminated from the playoff hunt. They only won one out of their last four games. After a loss to the New York Giants on December 30, 2012, longtime head coach Andy Reid was fired after fourteen seasons with the team.[25]\\r\\nOn January 16, 2013, the Eagles brought in University of Oregon head coach Chip Kelly to succeed Reid as head coach after a 4ÿ12 season.[26] The Philadelphia Eagles named Michael Vick starting quarterback going into the 2013 season with much promise running Chip Kelly's fast-paced spread offense.\\r\\nThe 2013 season proved to be more successful for the Eagles. A hamstring injury took Michael Vick out after a 1ÿ3 start, but his backup, Nick Foles, led the team to a 10ÿ6 regular season record, and its seventh NFC East title in 13 seasons. Before throwing his first interception in Week 14, Foles threw 19 touchdowns, which was just one shy of the all-time NFL record of consecutive touchdowns without an interception to start a season, set earlier in the season by Peyton Manning. Foles also tied Manning for most touchdown passes in a single-game with seven against the Oakland Raiders which also made him the youngest player in NFL history to throw that many touchdowns in a game. Foles finished the regular season with 27 touchdown passes and only 2 interceptions, giving him the then-best TD-INT ratio in NFL history. (That record was later broken by Tom Brady, in the 2016 season.) He also finished with a 119.0 passer rating, third highest in league history behind only Aaron Rodgers in 2011 and Peyton Manning in 2004. He was also only the second quarterback in NFL history to have a game in which he topped 400 passing yards and a perfect passer rating. LeSean McCoy finished his Pro Bowl season as the league's top rusher with 1,607 rushing yards (also a franchise record) and 2,146 total yards from scrimmage, also best in the NFL. As a whole, the Eagles offense scored 51 touchdowns, most in franchise history passing the previous season high set back in 1948.\\r\\nThe Eagles opened the 2014 season winning their first three games and making NFL history as the only team ever to trail by ten or more points in their first three games and come back to win.[27] Nick Foles struggled with turnovers, but ultimately did well and led the Eagles to a 6ÿ2 record, before breaking his collarbone, resulting in his job getting taken over by Mark Sanchez, who outplayed Foles despite facing more playoff teams. The Eagles held the divisional title from week one to week 15 against the Cowboys. After going 9ÿ3 with their crucial win over the Cowboys, the Eagles lost their next 3, and a week after losing the NFC East title, they lost an upset against the 3ÿ11 Redskins and were eliminated from playoff contention with the Cowboys' win over the Colts.\\r\\nFollowing the 2014 season, Chip Kelly was given total control and made some controversial moves. He traded LeSean McCoy, who had become the team's all-time leading rusher after the 2014 season, for linebacker Kiko Alonso, a player Kelly coached at Oregon who had missed the entire 2014 season.[28] He also cut ten-year veteran and starter, Trent Cole, who was still a consistent threat on defense and was second only to legend Reggie White on the Eagles all-time sack list.[29] He also made a trade where the highly successful Nick Foles was traded for Sam Bradford, who had missed the entire 2014 season with an ACL tear.[30] Kelly tried to re-sign Jeremy Maclin, who had stepped up as the team's leading wide receiver, but he signed with the Kansas City Chiefs instead. However, the Eagles also acquired league leading rusher DeMarco Murray,[31] which not only helped the Eagles, but hurt their rivals, the Dallas Cowboys. They also obtained Super Bowl champion Byron Maxwell,[32] who left the Seattle Seahawks in free agency to sign a six-year, $63 million contract. The first two games of the season were disastrous, as they started 0ÿ2. Bradford had a 2ÿ4 TD-INT ratio, Maxwell was constantly beaten by Falcons receiver Julio Jones, and Murray was held to 11 yards on 21 carries. After Murray was injured, Ryan Mathews rushed for over 100 yards in a Week 3 win against the New York Jets. Kelly made Murray the unquestioned starter and although Murray's play improved over the season, he never regained his dominant form and was held to a career low 3.6 yards per carry average.\\r\\nOn December 29, 2015, with one game left in the season, head coach Chip Kelly was released by the Eagles. Offensive Coordinator Pat Shurmur was named Interim Coach for the final game against the rival New York Giants, which Shurmur won 35ÿ30.[33] Former player and current running backs coach Duce Staley was the first coach to be interviewed for the opening head coaching job on January 2, 2016.[34]\\r\\nThe Eagles hired Chiefs offensive coordinator Doug Pederson as their next head coach. The team made the official announcement on January 18, 2016. Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said in a statement:\\r\\n\\"Doug is a strategic thinker, a compelling leader and communicator, and someone who truly knows how to get the best out of his players. All of these factors were what initially attracted us to Doug and we believe that he is the right man to help us achieve our ultimate goal.\\"\\r\\nPederson had been with the Chiefs for the preceding three years after spending the four seasons previous to those with the Eagles. He served as a quality control assistant for the Eagles in 2009 and 2010 before being promoted to quarterbacks coach for the 2011 and 2012 seasons. He was praised for his work with Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith over the preceding few seasons, particularly 2015, as the Chiefs moved into the top 10 in scoring offense.[35][36]\\r\\nAt the end of the 2015 season, the Eagles had the 13th pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. They traded Byron Maxwell, Kiko Alonso, and their pick to the Miami Dolphins for the #8 pick. Later, they traded the #8 pick, their third-round pick, their fourth-round pick, a 2017 first-round pick, and a 2018 second-round pick to the Cleveland Browns for the #2 pick and a 2017 fourth-round pick. They used the #2 pick to draft North Dakota State quarterback Carson Wentz. On September 3, 2016, the Eagles traded starting quarterback Sam Bradford to the Minnesota Vikings, who had lost Teddy Bridgewater for the season, for a 2017 first-round pick and a 2018 fourth-round pick. Following the trade, the Eagles named Wentz the starting quarterback for Week 1 of the 2016 season.[37] First-time head coach Pederson led the Eagles to a 3ÿ0 start to the season. His rookie quarterback started with 5 touchdowns, no interceptions and over 255 yards per game. The Week 4 bye took a toll on the Eagles, and they lost four out of the next five games, including a loss to every rival team in their division. They also lost right tackle Lane Johnson to a 10-game suspension following the Week 5 loss againist the Lions which damaged Carson Wentz's hot start. In those four games, their average margin of loss was just under 5 points.[38] Pederson and the Eagles won just 3 of their last 7 games. Those included gruesome road losses against the Seattle Seahawks, the Cincinnati Bengals, and the Baltimore Ravens. Although Wentz started off the season well, the 6ÿ5 quarterback finished with a TDÿINT ratio of 16:14. The rookie head coach and rookie quarterback tandem led the Eagles to a disappointing year, finishing with a 7ÿ9 record and coming in last in the division.\\r\\nDuring the following offseason, the team made several acquisitions on the offensive side of the ball. The Eagles either traded or released notable players from the Chip Kelly era like Ryan Mathews, Matt Tobin, Allen Barbre, Jordan Matthews and Marcus Smith II. They signed more notable players to improve its wide receiver corps that have struggled the last two seasons like Alshon Jeffery, and Torrey Smith as well as 2016 Super Bowl champion, Legarrette Blount. They also added veterans on defense such as Patrick Robinson, Chris Long, Corey Graham, Tim Jernigan and Ronald Darby. The team addressed its defense mostly in the draft, using its top three picks on defensive players. The Eagles drafted Derek Barnett with the 14th overall pick. The Eagles had completely revamped their offense and strengthened their defense heading into the 2017 season. They opened the season on the road versus the Washington Redskins and won the game 30ÿ17. The team lost to the Kansas City Chiefs the following week, 27ÿ20, in Pederson's return to face Andy Reid. The Eagles then won six consecutive games, including signature wins at the Carolina Panthers, 28ÿ23, and versus the Washington Redskins, 34ÿ24, in a Monday Night contest. On the morning of October 31, 2017, just before the NFL trade deadline, the Eagles made a blockbuster move sending a fourth-round pick to the Miami Dolphins for star running back Jay Ajayi. The move immediately paid dividends for the Eagles heading into their next game versus the Denver Broncos as Ajayi rushed for 77 yards on just eight attempts including a 46-yard TD near the end of the second quarter. Ajayi and Wentz led the Eagles to a 51ÿ23 rout of the top defense in the NFL.\\r\\nThe Eagles headed into their bye week with the best record in the NFL (8ÿ1), and with Wentz leading the NFL MVP discussion with an NFL-leading 23 touchdowns to 5 interceptions. During their bye, the Eagles signed former Giants offensive tackle Will Beatty and former Saints linebacker Dannell Ellerbe to not only add depth but also players with Super Bowl experiences. Coming off of the bye week, the Philadelphia Eagles entered a Sunday night showdown with the defending NFC East champion Dallas Cowboys. The Eagles came out sluggish and trailed 9ÿ7 at the half. The team exploded in the second half though, rattling off 30 unanswered points to soundly defeat their rival by a final score of 37ÿ9. The Eagles were rolling on a nine-game winning streak after a huge blowout win over the Chicago Bears.[28] The Eagles traveled to Seattle in Week 13 in a huge Sunday Night showdown against Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks. The Eagles struggled throughout the whole game, blowing many scoring opportunities and allowing Wilson to throw 3 touchdowns. The Eagles lost 24ÿ10, ending their win streak. However, the Eagles bounced back in Week 14 win over the Los Angeles Rams in a tough 43ÿ35 win. However, Carson Wentz left the game in the third quarter with a knee injury. It was later found out that Wentz tore his ACL, ending his MVP caliber season. Backup Nick Foles would once again take over as starting quarterback. In Foles's first start against the New York Giants, he would lead them back from a 20ÿ7 deficit and score 4 touchdowns and win the game 34ÿ29. Foles struggled in the last two games of the season against the Oakland Raiders and the Dallas Cowboys, and threw a touchdown and 2 interceptions in that span. Despite this, the Eagles finished 13ÿ3 and secured the top seed in the NFC. The Eagles opened as the underdogs, the first time in history that a No. 1 seed has opened up the postseason as an underdog. Despite this, Foles would lead the Eagles past the Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round 15ÿ10. In the next game Foles and the Eagles annihilated the Minnesota Vikings 38ÿ7 in the NFC Championship nicknamed the Minneapolis Massacre, mocking the Minneapolis Miracle from their previous playoff victory. Foles had his best game since week 15 and threw for 352 passing yards and 3 touchdowns including an impressive flea flicker touchdown pass. This win marked the franchise's third Super Bowl appearance and a berth in Super Bowl LII for a 2005 rematch against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.\\r\\nWith Foles at the helm, the Eagles started off the game strong, leading the Patriots 22ÿ12 at halftime. In the second half the Patriots gained momentum and for the first time took the lead in the 4th quarter 33ÿ32. The Eagles rallied back and scored an 11-yard Touchdown to tight end Zach Ertz. Later the Eagles converted on a 46-yard field goal by Jake Elliott to lead 41ÿ33. On the final play of the game with 9 seconds left, Brady threw a hail-mary pass directed toward tight end Rob Gronkowski which was bobbled by Patrick Robinson before being dropped in the end-zone as time expired, securing the win for the Eagles 41ÿ33, and ending the 58-year long championship drought. This would be Philadelphia's first Super Bowl win and their fourth league championship (their first championship since 1960). Foles won Super Bowl MVP going 28ÿ43 with 373 passing yards, 3 touchdowns, and an interception. Nick Foles became the first backup quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl since his opponent Tom Brady won as the backup for Drew Bledsoe in 2001.\\r\\nOne of the NFL's oldest, this rivalry began on October 15, 1933[39] when the Giants defeated the newly founded Eagles 56ÿ0. The Giants lead the all-time series 84ÿ82ÿ2. Three of the best known comebacks against the Giants are labeled as \\"Miracle In The Meadowlands ÿ Herm Edwards\\", \\"Miracle In The Meadowlands II ÿ Brian Westbrook\\" and \\"Miracle In The New Meadowlands ÿ DeSean Jackson\\".\\r\\nThe Cowboys have been one of the Eagles' biggest rivals. The Eagles won the first game in this rivalry 27ÿ25 on September 30, 1960. Dallas leads the all-time series 63ÿ51ÿ0. They have been close in recent years, with Dallas winning 12 games from 2006 to the present while the Eagles have also won 12. There is much hostility between the two teams' fan bases, with incidents such as the 1989 Bounty Bowl.\\r\\nNot as big as the rivalries between the Giants and Cowboys, that with division rivals Washington Redskins is still fierce. It started in 1934 when the Washington Redskins were first known as the Boston Redskin; the Redskins defeated the Eagles 6ÿ0, and lead the all-time series 85ÿ76ÿ6. The rivalry has been very even since 2010 overall. However, the Eagles swept the Redskins during the 2017 season for the first time since the 2013 season.\\r\\nThe Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933. From that season, through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams as both were part of the same division. In 1967, they were placed in separate divisions but remained in the same conference for three years. Finally, in 1970, the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year. Currently they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season, the most recent meeting being in 2016 at Philadelphia, with the Eagles winning 34-3. The Steelers have lost nine straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the Super Bowl era. The Eagles lead the all-time series 47ÿ28ÿ3.\\r\\nFor several decades, the Eagles' colors were kelly green, silver, and white. In 1954, the Eagles, along with the Baltimore Colts, became the second team ever in the NFL to put a logo on their helmets, with silver wings on a kelly green helmet. In 1969, the team wore two helmet versions: Kelly green with white wings in road games, and white with kelly green wings at home. From 1970 to '73, they wore the white helmets with Kelly green wings exclusively before switching back to Kelly green helmets with silver wings. By 1974, Joseph A. Scirrotto Jr. designed the silver wings took on a white outline, and this style on a kelly green helmet became standard for over two decades.\\r\\nFrom 1948ÿ95, the team logo was an eagle in flight carrying a football in its claws, although from '69ÿ72, the eagle took on a more stylized look. As the design was similar to the Apollo 11 emblem, and its moon-landing craft was dubbed Eagle, players wore the flight's mission patch on their jerseys during 1969.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1973, the team's name was added below the eagle, which returned to its pre-'69 look.\\r\\nHowever, both the logo and uniforms were radically altered in 1996. The primary kelly green color was changed to a darker shade, officially described as \\"midnight green.\\" Silver was practically abandoned, as uniform pants moved to either white or midnight green. The traditional helmet wings were changed to a primarily white color, with silver and black accents. The team's logo combination (the eagle and club name lettering) also changed in 1996, with the eagle itself limited to a white (bald eagle) head, drawn in a less realistic, more cartoon-based style, and the lettering changing from calligraphic to block letters.\\r\\nSince the 1996 alterations, the team has made only minor alterations, mostly relating to jersey/pant combinations worn during specific games. For example, in 1997, against the San Francisco 49ers, the team wore midnight green jerseys and pants for the first of only two occasions in team history. The second occasion was in 2002, during the final regular season game at Veterans Stadium, a win over the division-rival Washington Redskins. A year later, in the first two games of the 2003 season (both home losses to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New England Patriots), the Eagles wore white jerseys with white pants. Since 2003, the white jerseys along with white pants have been worn during preseason games.\\r\\nThe 2003 season also saw the first (though only subtle) change to the 1996-style uniform. On both white and green jerseys, black shadows and silver trim were added to both the green and white numbering. The stripe on the pants changed from black-green-black to black-silver-green on the white pants, and from a solid black stripe to one stripe of black, another of silver, with one small white stripe in between for the midnight blue pants. The 2003 season also saw the team debut black alternate jerseys, with a green (instead of black) shadow on white numbers, and silver trim. These black jerseys have been worn for two selected home games each season (usually the first home game after bye week and the season finale). In the 2003 and 2004 regular season home finales, the team wore the green road pants with the black alternate jerseys, but lost each game. Since then, the Eagles have only worn the black jerseys with the white pants. However, due to the special 75th anniversary uniforms serving as the \\"alternates\\" for one game in 2007, the Eagles could not wear the alternate black jersey that season per league rules (alternate uniforms are permitted twice per season but only one can be used). The black jerseys with white pants, however, re-appeared for the 2008 Thanksgiving night game against the Arizona Cardinals. The black jerseys were most recently used in a December 21, 2016 game against the New York Giants, in which they won 24-19. From 2006ÿ2013, the Eagles have only worn the alternate black jerseys once a season and for the last November home game, but did not use them in 2007, 2010, and 2011. For the 2007 and 2010 seasons, the Eagles used throwback uniforms in place of the black alternates for their anniversary to commemorate past teams. The team also started wearing black shoes exclusively in 2004. Since 2014, the Eagles have worn the black jersey twice per season. In 2016, they wore the black jersey three times.\\r\\nTo celebrate the team's 75th anniversary, the 2007 uniforms featured a 75th-season logo patch on the left shoulder. In addition, the team wore \\"throwback\\" jerseys in a 2007 game against the Detroit Lions. The yellow and blue jerseys, the same colors found on Philadelphia's city flag, are based on those worn by the Philadelphia Eagles in the team's inaugural season, and were the same colors used by the former Frankford Yellow Jackets franchise prior to their suspension of operations in 1931. The Eagles beat Detroit, 56ÿ21.[41]\\r\\nThe Philadelphia Eagles wear their white jerseys at home for preseason games and daytime games in the first half of the regular season from September to mid-October when the temperature is warmer. In night contests in the first half of the regular season, the Eagles do not need to wear white at home since the temperature is cooler. However, there have been exceptions, such as the home opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2003 and the Washington Redskins in 2007 that were played at night. In late October or beginning in November, the Eagles start to wear their colors at home (although they have done it earlier before), be it the midnight green jerseys or a third jersey. On one occasion the Eagles wore white at home after October in a meeting against the Dallas Cowboys on November 4, 2007 to make the Cowboys wear their road blue jerseys. Since moving to Lincoln Financial Field in 2003, the Eagles have worn white at home for at least their home opener, with the exceptions for the 2010 home opener (see next paragraph), the 2011 home opener against the New York Giants, the 2016 home opener against the Cleveland Browns, and the 2017 home opener against the Giants.\\r\\nIn the 2010 season against the Green Bay Packers, on September 12, 2010, the Eagles wore uniforms similar to the ones that were worn by the 1960 championship team in honor the 50th anniversary of that team.[42] In weeks 4 and 6 of the 2010 season, the Eagles wore their white jerseys in a match-up against the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons respectively before reverting to their midnight green jerseys for the rest of their home games. For the 2011 season, the Eagles did not wear white for any of their home games.\\r\\nFor the 2012 season Nike took over from Reebok as the NFL's official apparel licensee but the Eagles decided that they would not be adopting Nike's \\"Elite 51\\" uniform technology. Aside from the Nike logo replacing the Reebok logo, the only other change is the league-wide revision of the NFL shield on the uniform (replacing the NFL Equipment logo), other than that the uniforms essentially remain unchanged. The Eagles also revived their black alternate jersey.\\r\\nFor the 2013 season, the Eagles started to wear white pants, as an alternate to their green pants, with their white jerseys, in the regular season.\\r\\nFor the 2014 season the Eagles have officially adopted the \\"Elite 51 style uniform from Nike. Recently the team has discussed bringing back the \\"Kelly Green\\" uniforms similar to the uniforms worn in the 1960 NFL Championship season and which were last worn in the 2010 season opener vs. Green Bay. Traditionally kelly green, silver and white had been the official team color until 1996 season when it switched to the current \\"Midnight Green\\" uniforms. But due to the NFL rules and restrictions having a team go through a waiting period before any major uniform changes and alterations can be made, it would most likely be quite some time before any uniform changes are officially made.\\r\\nIn Week 6 of 2014 against the New York Giants, the team introduced black pants to complement their black jerseys, giving them a blackout uniform set, the Eagles won the game 27ÿ0. The victory was their first shutout in 18 years. The blackout uniform was most recently worn in a Week 16 victory, 19-10, against the Raiders in 2017. The Eagles are 6ÿ3 in their blackout uniforms: winning three times against the Giants and once against each of the Minnesota Vikings, Denver Broncos, and Oakland Raiders, and losing against the Seattle Seahawks, Arizona Cardinals, and Green Bay Packers.\\r\\nThe Eagles previously held their preseason training camp from the end of July through mid-August each year at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley.[43] With the addition of new head coach Chip Kelly, the Eagles recently moved their training camp to the NovaCare Complex in Philadelphia.[44][45] Training camps were previously held at Chestnut Hill Academy in 1935, Saint Joseph's University in 1939 and 1943, Saranac Lake from 1946ÿ1948, Hershey from 1951ÿ1967, Albright College from 1968ÿ1972, Widener University from 1973ÿ1979, and West Chester University from 1980ÿ1995.[45]\\r\\nThis fight song is heard during Eagles' home games after touchdowns and before the team is introduced prior to kickoff.\\r\\nAlthough the method may vary, studies that attempt to rank the 32 fan bases in the NFL consistently place Eagles fans among the best in the league, noting their \\"unmatched fervor.\\"[46] Eagles fans have numerous dedicated web communities, ranking the Eagles just behind the Phillies as the dominant Philadelphia sports presence on the web.[47]\\r\\nThe American City Business Journals, which conducts a regular study to determine the most loyal fans in the NFL, evaluates fans based primarily on attendance-related factors,[48] and ranked Eagles fans third in both 1999[49] and 2006.[50] The 2006 study called the fans \\"incredibly loyal\\", noting that they filled 99.8% of the seats in the stadium over the previous decade.[51] Forbes placed the Eagles fans first in its 2008 survey,[52] which was based on the correlation between team performance and fan attendance.[53] ESPN.com placed Eagles fans fourth in the league in its 2008 survey, citing the connection between the team's performance and the mood of the city.[54] The last home game which was blacked out on television in the Philadelphia market as a result of not being sold out was against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, September 12, 1999, which was Andy Reid's first home game as new head coach of the Eagles.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe studies note thatwin or loseEagles fans can be counted on to pack their stadium. As of August 2008, the team had sold out 71 consecutive games, and 70,000 were on the team's waiting list for season tickets.[54] Despite finishing with a 6ÿ10 record in the 2005 season, the Eagles ranked second in the NFL in merchandise sales, and single-game tickets for the next season were sold out minutes after phone and Internet lines opened.[55]\\r\\nEagles fans have also been known to chant the famous, \\"E-A-G-L-E-S ÿ Eagles!!\\" at Flyers, Phillies, and 76ers games when the team is getting blown out late in a game and a loss is inevitable, signifying their displeasure with the given team's performance, and that they are instead putting their hope into the Eagles.\\r\\nAlong with their fierce devotion, Eagles fans have a reputation for bad behavior and sports-related violence, especially when the team plays its rivals.[56] In If Football's a Religion, Why Don't We Have a Prayer?, Jere Longman described the fans of the 700 Level of Veterans Stadium as having a reputation for \\"hostile taunting, fighting, public urination and general strangeness.\\"[57] So many incidents occurred at a 1997 game against the 49ers that at the following home game, Judge Seamus McCaffery began presiding over a temporary courtroom at the stadium; 20 suspects came before him that day.[56] Fan behavior improved after the team's move to Lincoln Financial Field, and \\"Eagles Court\\" ended in December 2003.[58]\\r\\nThe team also has its own cheerleading squad, which performs a variety of dance moves for the fans and the Eagles on the sideline.[59] The squad also releases a swimsuit calendar each year, and is the first squad in the league to release the calendar on the Android and iOS mobile systems.[60][61]\\r\\nRunning backs\\r\\nWide receivers\\r\\nTight ends\\r\\nDefensive linemen\\r\\nDefensive backs\\r\\nSpecial teams\\r\\n\\r\\nRoster updated April 4, 2018\\r\\nDepth chart ?

Shelley started writing the story when she was 18, and the first edition of the novel was published anonymously in London on 1 January 1818, when she was 20.[2] Her name first appeared on the second edition, published in France in 1823.\\r\\n\\r\\nShelley travelled through Europe in 1814, journeying along the river Rhine in Germany with a stop in Gernsheim, which is 17 kilometres (11?mi) away from Frankenstein Castle, where, two centuries before, an alchemist was engaged in experiments.[3][4][5] Later, she travelled in the region of Geneva (Switzerland)where much of the story takes placeand the topic of galvanism and occult ideas were themes of conversation among her companions, particularly her lover and future husband, Percy Shelley. Mary, Percy and Lord Byron decided to have a competition to see who could write the best horror story. After thinking for days, Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made; her dream later evolved into the novel's story.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrankenstein is infused with elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement. At the same time, it is an early example of science fiction. Brian Aldiss has argued that it should be considered the first true science fiction story because, in contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction, the central character \\"makes a deliberate decision\\" and \\"turns to modern experiments in the laboratory\\" to achieve fantastic results.[6] It has had a considerable influence in literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of horror stories, films and plays.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the novel's publication, the name \\"Frankenstein\\" has often been used to refer to the monster itself. This usage is sometimes considered erroneous, but usage commentators regard it as well-established and acceptable.[7][8][9] In the novel, the monster is identified by words such as \\"creature\\", \\"monster\\", \\"demon\\", \\"wretch\\", \\"abortion\\", \\"fiend\\" and \\"it\\". Speaking to Victor Frankenstein, the monster says \\"I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel\\" (which ties to Lucifer in Paradise Lost, which the monster reads, and which relates to the disobedience of Prometheus in the book's subtitle).\\r\\n\\r\\nFrankenstein is written in the form of a frame story that starts with Captain Robert Walton writing letters to his sister. It takes place at an unspecified time in the 18th century, as the letters' dates are given as \\"17\\". In the story following the letters by Walton, the readers find that Victor Frankenstein creates a monster that brings tragedy to his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe novel Frankenstein is written in epistolary form, documenting a fictional correspondence between Captain Robert Walton and his sister, Margaret Walton Saville. Walton is a failed writer and captain who sets out to explore the North Pole and expand his scientific knowledge in hopes of achieving fame. During the voyage, the crew spots a dog sled driven by a gigantic figure. A few hours later, the crew rescues a nearly frozen and emaciated man named Victor Frankenstein. Frankenstein has been in pursuit of the gigantic man observed by Walton's crew. Frankenstein starts to recover from his exertion; he sees in Walton the same obsession that has destroyed him, and recounts a story of his life's miseries to Walton as a warning. The recounted story serves as the frame for Frankenstein's narrative.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictor begins by telling of his childhood. Born in Naples, Italy, into a wealthy Genevan family, Victor and his brothers, Ernest and William, all three being sons of Alphonse Frankenstein by the former Caroline Beaufort, are encouraged to seek a greater understanding of the world through chemistry. As a young boy, Victor is obsessed with studying outdated theories that focus on simulating natural wonders. When Victor is five years old, his parents adopt Elizabeth Lavenza, the orphaned daughter of an expropriated Italian nobleman, with whom Victor (allegedly) later falls in love. During this period, Victor's parents, Alphonse and Caroline, take in yet another orphan, Justine Moritz, who becomes William's nanny.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeeks before he leaves for the University of Ingolstadt in Germany, his mother dies of scarlet fever; Victor buries himself in his experiments to deal with the grief. At the university, he excels at chemistry and other sciences, soon developing a secret technique to impart life to non-living matter. Eventually, he undertakes the creation of a humanoid, but due to the difficulty in replicating the minute parts of the human body, Victor makes the Creature tall, about 8 feet (2.4?m) in height and proportionally large. Despite Victor selecting its features as beautiful, upon animation the creature is instead hideous, with watery white eyes and yellow skin that barely conceals the muscles and blood vessels underneath. Repulsed by his work, Victor flees and dismisses him when it awakens. While wandering the streets, he meets his childhood friend, Henry Clerval, and takes Henry back to his apartment, fearful of Henry's reaction if he sees the monster. However, the Creature has escaped.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictor falls ill from the experience and is nursed back to health by Henry. After a four-month recovery, he returns home when he learns of the murder of his brother William. Upon arriving in Geneva, Victor sees the Creature near the crime scene and climbing a mountain, leading him to believe his creation is responsible. Justine Moritz, William's nanny, is convicted of the crime after William's locket, which had contained a miniature portrait of Caroline, is found in her pocket. Victor is helpless to stop her from being hanged, as he knows no one would believe his story.\\r\\n\\r\\nRavaged by grief and guilt, Victor retreats into the mountains. The Creature finds him and pleads for Victor to hear his tale.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntelligent and articulate, the Creature relates his first days of life, living alone in the wilderness and finding that people were afraid of and hated him due to his appearance, which led him to fear and hide from them. While living in an abandoned structure connected to a cottage, he grew fond of the poor family living there, and discreetly collected firewood for them. Secretly living among the family for months, the Creature learned to speak by listening to them and he taught himself to read after discovering a lost satchel of books in the woods. When he saw his reflection in a pool, he realized his physical appearance was hideous, and it terrified him as it terrifies normal humans. Nevertheless, he approached the family in hopes of becoming their friend. Initially he was able to befriend the blind father figure of the family, but the rest of them were frightened and they all fled their home, resulting in the Creature leaving, disappointed. He traveled to Victor's family estate using details from Victor's journal, murdered William, and framed Justine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Creature demands that Victor create a female companion like himself. He argues that as a living being, he has a right to happiness. The Creature promises that he and his mate will vanish into the South American wilderness, never to reappear, if Victor grants his request. Should Victor refuse his request, The Creature also threatens to kill Victor's remaining friends and loved ones and not stop until he completely ruins him.\\r\\n\\r\\nFearing for his family, Victor reluctantly agrees. The Creature says he will watch over Victor's progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nClerval accompanies him to England, but they separate at Victor's insistence at Perth, Scotland. Victor suspects that the Creature is following him. Working on the female creature on the Orkney Islands, he is plagued by premonitions of disaster, such as the female hating the Creature or becoming more evil than him, but more particularly the two creatures might lead to the breeding of a race that could plague mankind. He tears apart the unfinished female creature after he sees the Creature, who had indeed followed Victor, watching through a window. The Creature later confronts and tries to threaten Victor into working again, but Victor is convinced that the Creature is evil and that its mate would be evil as well, and the pair would threaten all humanity. Victor destroys his work and the Creature vows that he will \\"be with [him] on [his] wedding night\\". Victor interprets this as a threat upon his life, believing that the Creature will kill him after he finally becomes happy. When Victor lands in Ireland, he is soon imprisoned for Clerval's murder, as the Creature had strangled Clerval to death and left the corpse to be found where his creator had arrived, causing the latter to suffer another mental breakdown in prison. After being acquitted, Victor returns home with his father, who has restored to Elizabeth some of her father's fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Geneva, Victor is about to marry Elizabeth and prepares to fight the Creature to the death, arming himself with pistols and a dagger. The night following their wedding, Victor asks Elizabeth to stay in her room while he looks for \\"the fiend\\". While Victor searches the house and grounds, the Creature strangles Elizabeth to death. From the window, Victor sees the Creature, who tauntingly points at Elizabeth's corpse; Victor tries to shoot him, but the Creature escapes. After Victor gets back to Geneva, Victor's father, weakened by age and by the death of his precious Elizabeth, dies a few days later. Seeking revenge, Victor pursues the Creature to the North Pole, but collapses from exhaustion and hypothermia before he can find his quarry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of Victor's narrative, Captain Walton resumes the telling of the story, closing the frame around Victor's recounting. A few days after the Creature vanished, the ship becomes trapped in pack ice and multiple crewmen die in the cold, before the rest of Walton's crew insists on returning south once it is freed. Upon hearing the crew's pleas to their captain, Victor, angered, lectures them with a powerful speech: it is hardship, not comfort and easiness, that defines a glorious undertaking such as theirs; he urges them to be men, not cowards. The ship is freed and Walton, owing it to the will of his men, albeit regretfully, decides to return South. Victor, even though in very weak condition, states that he will go on by himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictor dies shortly thereafter, telling Walton, with his last words, to seek \\"happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition\\". Walton discovers the Creature on his ship, mourning over Victor's body. The Creature tells Walton that Victor's death has not brought him peace; rather, his crimes have left him completely alone. The Creature vows to kill himself so that no others will ever know of his existence. Walton watches as the Creature drifts away on an ice raft that is soon \\"lost in darkness and distance\\", never to be seen again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow I, then a young girl, came to think of, and to dilate upon, so very hideous an idea?\\r\\nDuring the rainy summer of 1816, the \\"Year Without a Summer\\", the world was locked in a long cold volcanic winter caused by the eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815.[11] Mary Shelley, aged 18, and her lover (and later husband) Percy Bysshe Shelley visited Lord Byron at the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva in Switzerland. The weather was consistently too cold and dreary that summer to enjoy the outdoor holiday activities they had planned, so the group retired indoors until dawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nSitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves by reading German ghost stories translated into French from the book Fantasmagoriana,[12] then Byron proposed that they \\"each write a ghost story\\".[13] Unable to think of a story, young Mary became anxious: \\"Have you thought of a story? I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative.\\"[14] During one evening in the middle of summer, the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life. \\"Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated\\", Mary noted, \\"galvanism had given token of such things\\".[15] It was after midnight before they retired, and unable to sleep, she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the grim terrors of her \\"waking dream\\".[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half vital motion. Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2011, astronomer Donald Olson, after a visit to the Lake Geneva villa the previous year and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars, concluded that her \\"waking dream\\" took place \\"between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m.\\" on 16 June 1816, several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that they each write a ghost story.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began writing what she assumed would be a short story. With Percy Shelley's encouragement, she expanded the tale into a full-fledged novel.[19] She later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment \\"when I first stepped out from childhood into life\\".[20] Shelley wrote the first four chapters in the weeks following the suicide of her half-sister Fanny.[21] This was one of many personal tragedies that impacted Shelley's work. Shelley's first child died in infancy, and when she began composing Frankenstein in 1816, she was likely nursing her second child, who would also be dead at Frankenstein's publication.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nByron managed to write just a fragment based on the vampire legends he heard while travelling the Balkans, and from this John Polidori created The Vampyre (1819), the progenitor of the romantic vampire literary genre. Thus two seminal horror tales originated from the conclave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group talked about Enlightenment and Counter-Enlightenment ideas as well. Shelley believed the Enlightenment idea that society could progress and grow if political leaders used their powers responsibly; however, she also believed the Romantic ideal that misused power could destroy society (Bennett 36ÿ42).[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nShelley's manuscripts for the first three-volume edition in 1818 (written 1816ÿ1817), as well as the fair copy for her publisher, are now housed in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. The Bodleian acquired the papers in 2004, and they belong now to the Abinger Collection.[24] In 2008, the Bodleian published a new edition of Frankenstein, edited by Charles E. Robinson, that contains comparisons of Mary Shelley's original text with Percy Shelley's additions and interventions alongside.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nShelley completed her writing in April/May 1817, and Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus was published on 1 January 1818[26] by the small London publishing house Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor, & Jones.[27][28] It was issued anonymously, with a preface written for Mary by Percy Bysshe Shelley and with a dedication to philosopher William Godwin, her father. It was published in an edition of just 500 copies in three volumes, the standard \\"triple-decker\\" format for 19th-century first editions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second edition of Frankenstein was published on 11 August 1823 in two volumes (by G. and W. B. Whittaker) following the success of the stage play Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein by Richard Brinsley Peake.[29] This edition credited Mary Shelley as the book's author on its title page.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 31 October 1831, the first \\"popular\\" edition in one-volume appeared, published by Henry Colburn & Richard Bentley.[30] This edition was heavily revised by Mary Shelley, partially to make the story less radical. It included a lengthy new preface by the author, presenting a somewhat embellished version of the genesis of the story. This edition is the one most widely published and read now, although a few editions follow the 1818 text.[31] Some scholars prefer the original version, arguing that it preserves the spirit of Mary Shelley's vision (see Anne K. Mellor's \\"Choosing a Text of Frankenstein to Teach\\" in the W. W. Norton Critical edition).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, a new edition of the novel, titled The Original Frankenstein, edited by Charles E. Robinson, was published. Robinson examined the original manuscript by Mary Shelley and noted the edits that Percy Bysshe Shelley made to it.[32]\\r\\nPart of Frankenstein's rejection of his creation is the fact that he does not give it a name, which causes a lack of identity. Instead it is referred to by words such as \\"wretch\\", \\"monster\\", \\"creature\\", \\"demon\\", \\"devil\\", \\"fiend\\", and \\"it\\". When Frankenstein converses with the creature in Chapter 10, he addresses it as \\"vile insect\\", \\"abhorred monster\\", \\"fiend\\", \\"wretched devil\\", and \\"abhorred devil\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a telling of Frankenstein, Shelley referred to the creature as \\"Adam\\".[34][not in citation given] Shelley was referring to the first man in the Garden of Eden, as in her epigraph:\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the creature would be described in later works as a composite of whole body parts grafted together from cadavers and reanimated by the use of electricity, this description is not consistent with Shelley's work; both the use of electricity and the cobbled-together image of Frankenstein's monster were more the result of James Whale's popular 1931 film adaptation of the story, and other early motion-picture works based upon the creature. In Shelley's original work, Dr. Frankenstein discovers a previously unknown but elemental principle of life, and that insight allows him to develop a method to imbue vitality into inanimate matter, though the exact nature of the process is left largely ambiguous. After a great deal of hesitation in exercising this power, Frankenstein spends two years painstakingly constructing the creature's proportionally large body (one anatomical feature at a time, from raw materials supplied by \\"the dissecting room and the slaughter-house\\"), which he then brings to life using his unspecified process.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creature has often been mistakenly called \\"Frankenstein\\". In 1908 one author said \\"It is strange to note how well-nigh universally the term \\"Frankenstein\\" is misused, even by intelligent people, as describing some hideous monster\\".[35] Edith Wharton's The Reef (1916) describes an unruly child as an \\"infant Frankenstein.\\"[36] David Lindsay's \\"The Bridal Ornament\\", published in The Rover, 12 June 1844, mentioned \\"the maker of poor Frankenstein.\\" After the release of Whale's cinematic Frankenstein, the public at large began speaking of the creature itself as \\"Frankenstein\\". This also occurs in Frankenstein films, including Bride of Frankenstein (1935) and several subsequent films, as well as in film titles such as Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. Furthermore, the 1939 film Son of Frankenstein introduced an evil laboratory assistant, Ygor (Bela Lugosi), who never existed in the original narrative.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary Shelley maintained that she derived the name Frankenstein from a dream-vision. Despite her public claims of originality, however, a number of other sources have been suggested as Shelley's actual inspiration. The German name Frankenstein means \\"stone of the Franks\\", and it is associated with various places in Germany, including Frankenstein Castle (Burg Frankenstein) in Darmstadt, Hesse, and Frankenstein Castle in Frankenstein, a town in the Palatinate. There is also a castle called Frankenstein in Bad Salzungen, Thuringia, and a municipality called Frankenstein in Saxony. Until 1945, Z?bkowice ?l?skie, now a city in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Poland, was mainly populated by Germans and named Frankenstein in German, and was the site of a scandal involving gravediggers in 1606, which has been suggested as an inspiration to the author.[37] Finally, the name is borne by the aristocratic House of Franckenstein from Franconia.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadu Florescu argues that Mary and Percy Shelley visited Frankenstein Castle near Darmstadt in 1814 during their return to England from their elopement to Switzerland. It was at this castle that a notorious alchemist, Conrad Dippel, had experimented with human bodies, and Florescu reasons that Mary suppressed mention of her visit in order to maintain her public claim of originality.[38] A literary essay by A.?J. Day supports Florescu's position that Mary Shelley knew of and visited Frankenstein Castle before writing her debut novel.[39] Day includes details of an alleged description of the Frankenstein castle that exists in Mary Shelley's 'lost' journals. According to J?rg Helne, the 'lost journals', as well as Florescu's claims, cannot be verified.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nA possible interpretation of the name Victor is derived from Paradise Lost by John Milton, a great influence on Shelley (a quotation from Paradise Lost is on the opening page of Frankenstein and Shelley even has the monster himself read it).[41][42] Milton frequently refers to God as \\"the Victor\\" in Paradise Lost, and Shelley sees Victor as playing God by creating life. In addition, Shelley's portrayal of the monster owes much to the character of Satan in Paradise Lost; indeed, the monster says, after reading the epic poem, that he empathizes with Satan's role in the story.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many similarities between Victor and Percy Shelley, Mary's husband. Victor was a pen name of Percy Shelley's, as in the collection of poetry he wrote with his sister Elizabeth, Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire.[43] There is speculation that one of Mary Shelley's models for Victor Frankenstein was Percy, who at Eton had \\"experimented with electricity and magnetism as well as with gunpowder and numerous chemical reactions\\", and whose rooms at Oxford were filled with scientific equipment.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nPercy Shelley was the first-born son of a wealthy country squire with strong political connections and a descendant of Sir Bysshe Shelley, 1st Baronet of Castle Goring, and Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel.[45] Victor's family is one of the most distinguished of that republic and his ancestors were counselors and syndics. Percy had a sister named Elizabeth; Victor had an adopted sister named Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 22 February 1815, Mary Shelley gave birth to a baby two months prematurely, and the baby died two weeks later. Percy did not care about the condition of this premature infant and left with Claire, Mary's stepsister, for a lurid affair.[46] When Victor saw the creature come to life he fled the apartment, though the newborn creature approached him, as a child would a parent. The question of Victor's responsibility to the creature is one of the main themes of the book.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Modern Prometheus is the novel's subtitle (though some modern editions now drop the subtitle, mentioning it only in an introduction).[47] Prometheus, in later versions of Greek mythology, was the Titan who created mankind at the behest of Zeus. He made a being in the image of the gods that could have a spirit breathed into it.[48] Prometheus taught man to hunt, read, and heal their sick, but after he tricked Zeus into accepting poor-quality offerings from humans, Zeus kept fire from mankind. Prometheus, being the creator, took back the fire from Zeus to give to man. When Zeus discovered this, he sentenced Prometheus to be eternally punished by fixing him to a rock of Caucasus, where each day an eagle would peck out his liver, only for the liver to regrow the next day because of his immortality as a god. He was intended to suffer alone for eternity, but eventually Heracles (Hercules) released him.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrometheus was also a myth told in Latin, but was a very different story. In this version Prometheus makes man from clay and water, again a very relevant theme to Frankenstein, as Victor rebels against the laws of nature (how life is naturally made) and as a result is punished by his creation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Titan in the Greek mythology of Prometheus parallels Victor Frankenstein. Victor's work by creating man by new means reflects the same innovative work of the Titan in creating humans.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome have argued that Mary Shelley saw Prometheus not as a hero but rather as something of a devil, and blamed him for bringing fire to man and thereby seducing the human race to the vice of eating meat (fire brought cooking which brought hunting and killing).[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nByron was particularly attached to the play Prometheus Bound by Aeschylus, and Percy Shelley would soon write his own Prometheus Unbound (1820). The term \\"Modern Prometheus\\" was actually coined by Immanuel Kant in reference to Benjamin Franklin and his experiments with electricity.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nShelley incorporated a number of different sources into her work, one of which was the Promethean myth from Ovid. The influence of John Milton's Paradise Lost, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, are also clearly evident within the novel. Mary is likely to have acquired some ideas for Frankenstein's character from Humphry Davy's book Elements of Chemical Philosophy, in which he had written that \\"science has ... bestowed upon man powers which may be called creative; which have enabled him to change and modify the beings around him ...\\". References to the French Revolution run through the novel; a possible source may lie in Fran?ois-Flix Nogaret?(fr)'s Le Miroir des vnemens actuels, ou la Belle au plus offrant (1790): a political parable about scientific progress featuring an inventor named Frankste?n who creates a life-sized automaton.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nPercy Bysshe Shelley's 1816 poem \\"Mutability\\" is also quoted and its theme of the role of the subconscious is discussed in prose. The monster or Being also quotes a passage of the poem. His name has never appeared as the author of the poem although other poets are cited by name in the novel, implying that Mary wrote the poem and developed the psychological ideas. Another potential reason is to conceal his contributions to the novel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the past thirty years or so, many writers and historians have attempted to associate several then popular natural philosophers (now called physical scientists) with Shelley's work on account of several notable similarities. Two of the most notable natural philosophers among Shelley's contemporaries were Giovanni Aldini, who made many public attempts at human reanimation through bio-electric Galvanism in London[52] and Johann Konrad Dippel, who was supposed to have developed chemical means to extend the life span of humans. While Shelley was obviously aware of both these men and their activities, she makes no mention of or reference to them or their experiments in any of her published or released notes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrankenstein has been both well received and disregarded since its anonymous publication in 1818. Critical reviews of that time demonstrate these two views, along with confused speculation as to the identity of the author. The Belle Assemble described the novel as \\"very bold fiction\\" (139). The Quarterly Review stated that \\"the author has the power of both conception and language\\" (185). Sir Walter Scott, writing in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, congratulated \\"the author's original genius and happy power of expression\\" (620), although he is less convinced about the way in which the monster gains knowledge about the world and language.[54] The Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany hoped to see \\"more productions from this author\\" (253). On the other hand, the Quarterly Review described it \\"a tissue of horrible and disgusting absurdity\\".[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn two other reviews where the author is known as the daughter of William Godwin, the criticism of the novel makes reference to the feminine nature of Mary Shelley. The British Critic attacks the novel's flaws as the fault of the author: \\"The writer of it is, we understand, a female; this is an aggravation of that which is the prevailing fault of the novel; but if our authoress can forget the gentleness of her sex, it is no reason why we should; and we shall therefore dismiss the novel without further comment\\" (438). The Literary Panorama and National Register attacks the novel as a \\"feeble imitation of Mr. Godwin's novels\\" produced by the \\"daughter of a celebrated living novelist\\" (414). Despite the reviews, Frankenstein achieved an almost immediate popular success. It became widely known especially through melodramatic theatrical adaptationsMary Shelley saw a production of Presumption; or The Fate of Frankenstein, a play by Richard Brinsley Peake, in 1823. A French translation appeared as early as 1821 (Frankenstein: ou le Promthe Moderne, translated by Jules Saladin).\\r\\n\\r\\nCritical reception of Frankenstein has been largely positive since the mid-20th century.[56] Major critics such as M. A. Goldberg and Harold Bloom have praised the \\"aesthetic and moral\\" relevance of the novel,[57] although there are also critics such as Germaine Greer, who criticized the novel as terrible due to technical and narrative defects (such as it featuring three narrators that speak in the same way).[58] In more recent years the novel has become a popular subject for psychoanalytic and feminist criticism: Lawrence Lipking states: \\"[E]ven the Lacanian subgroup of psychoanalytic criticism, for instance, has produced at least half a dozen discrete readings of the novel\\".[59] The novel today is generally considered to be a landmark work of romantic and gothic literature, as well as science fiction.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilm director Guillermo del Toro describes Frankenstein as \\"the quintessential teenage book\\", adding \\"You don't belong. You were brought to this world by people that don't care for you and you are thrown into a world of pain and suffering, and tears and hunger. It's an amazing book written by a teenage girl. It's mind-blowing.\\"[61] Professor of philosophy Patricia MacCormack says the creature, brought to life by Victor Frankenstein, addresses the most fundamental human questions: \\"It's the idea of asking your maker what your purpose is. Why are we here, what can we do?\\"[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are numerous novels retelling or continuing the story of Frankenstein and his monster.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoose adaptations","input":"When was mary shelley's frankenstein first published?"},{"output":"Harvard, Princeton, Yale and Columbia","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ivy League is a collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private universities in the Northeastern United States. The conference name is also commonly used to refer to those eight schools as a group beyond the sports context.[2] The eight members are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University. The term Ivy League has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the term was in use as early as 1933, it became official only after the formation of the NCAA Division?I athletic conference in 1954.[3] Seven of the eight schools were founded during the United States colonial period; Cornell was founded in 1865. Ivy League institutions account for seven of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution; the other two are Rutgers University and the College of William & Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIvy League schools are generally viewed as some of the most prestigious, and are ranked among the best universities worldwide by U.S. News & World Report.[4] All eight universities place in the top fourteen of the U.S. News & World Report 2018 national university rankings, including the top four schools and five of the top eight.[5] U.S. News has named a member of the Ivy League as the best national university in each of the past eighteen years ending with the 2018 rankings: Princeton eleven times, Harvard twice, and the two schools tied for first five times.\\r\\n\\r\\nUndergraduate enrollments range from about 4,000 to 14,000,[6] making them larger than those of a typical private liberal arts college and smaller than a typical public state university. Total enrollments, including graduate students,  range from approximately 6,400 at Dartmouth to over 20,000 at Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, and Penn. Ivy League financial endowments range from Brown's $3.5 billion to Harvard's $34.5 billion,[7] the largest financial endowment of any academic institution in the world.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIvy League universities have some of the largest university financial endowments in the world, which allows the universities to provide many resources for their academic programs and research endeavors. As of 2014, Harvard University has an endowment of $36.4 billion.[9] Additionally, each university receives millions of dollars in research grants and other subsidies from federal and state governments.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents have long revered the ivied walls of older colleges. \\"Planting the ivy\\" was a customary class day ceremony at many colleges in the 1800s. In 1893, an alumnus told The Harvard Crimson, \\"In 1850, class day was placed upon the University Calendar.... the custom of planting the ivy, while the ivy oration was delivered, arose about this time.\\"[29] At Penn, graduating seniors started the custom of planting ivy at a university building each spring in 1873 and that practice was formally designated as \\"Ivy Day\\" in 1874.[30] Ivy planting ceremonies are reported for Yale,[31] Simmons,[32] Bryn Mawr[33] and many others. Princeton's \\"Ivy Club\\" was founded in 1879.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first usage of Ivy in reference to a group of colleges is from sportswriter Stanley Woodward (1895ÿ1965).\\r\\n\\r\\nA proportion of our eastern ivy colleges are meeting little fellows another Saturday before plunging into the strife and the turmoil.\\r\\nThe first known instance of the term Ivy League being used appeared in The Christian Science Monitor on February 7, 1935.[3][36][37] Several sportswriters and other journalists used the term shortly later to refer to the older colleges, those along the northeastern seaboard of the United States, chiefly the nine institutions with origins dating from the colonial era, together with the United States Military Academy (West Point), the United States Naval Academy, and a few others. These schools were known for their long-standing traditions in intercollegiate athletics, often being the first schools to participate in such activities. However, at this time, none of these institutions made efforts to form an athletic league.\\r\\n\\r\\nA common folk etymology attributes the name to the Roman numeral for four (IV), asserting that there was such a sports league originally with four members. The Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins helped to perpetuate this belief. The supposed \\"IV League\\" was formed over a century ago and consisted of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and a fourth school that varies depending on who is telling the story.[38][39][40] However, it is clear that Harvard, Princeton, Yale and Columbia met on November 23, 1876 at the so-called Massasoit Convention to decide on uniform rules for the emerging game of American football, which rapidly spread.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven out of the eight Ivy League schools were founded before the American Revolution; Cornell was founded just after the American Civil War. These seven were the primary colleges in the Northern and Middle Colonies, and their early faculties and founding boards were largely drawn from other Ivy League institutions. There were also some British graduates from the University of Cambridge, the University of Oxford, the University of St. Andrews, the University of Edinburgh, and elsewhere on their boards. Similarly, the founder of The College of William & Mary, in 1693, was a British graduate of the University of Edinburgh. Cornell provided Stanford University with its first president.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe influence of these institutions on the founding of other colleges and universities is notable. This included the Southern public college movement which blossomed in the decades surrounding the turn of the 19th century when Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia established what became the flagship universities for each of these states. In 1801, a majority of the first board of trustees for what became the University of South Carolina were Princeton alumni. They appointed Jonathan Maxcy, a Brown graduate, as the university's first president. Thomas Cooper, an Oxford alumnus and University of Pennsylvania faculty member, became the second president of the South Carolina college. The founders of the University of California came from Yale, hence the school colors of University of California are Yale Blue and California Gold.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the Ivy League schools have identifiable Protestant roots, while others were founded as non-sectarian schools. Church of England King's College broke up during the Revolution and was reformed as public nonsectarian Columbia College. In the early nineteenth century, the specific purpose of training Calvinist ministers was handed off to theological seminaries, but a denominational tone and such relics as compulsory chapel often lasted well into the twentieth century. Penn and Brown were officially founded as nonsectarian schools. Brown's charter promised no religious tests and \\"full liberty of conscience\\", but placed control in the hands of a board of twenty-two Baptists, five Quakers, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians. Cornell has been strongly nonsectarian from its founding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Ivy League\\" is sometimes used as a way of referring to an elite class, even though institutions such as Cornell University were among the first in the United States to reject racial and gender discrimination in their admissions policies. This dates back to at least 1935.[43] Novels[44] and memoirs[45] attest this sense, as a social elite; to some degree independent of the actual schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Second World War, the present Ivy League institutions slowly widened their selection of their students. They had always had distinguished faculties; some of the first Americans with doctorates had taught for them; but they now decided that they could not both be world-class research institutions and be competitive in the highest ranks of American college sport; in addition, the schools experienced the scandals of any other big-time football programs, although more quietly.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first formal athletic league involving eventual Ivy League schools (or any US colleges, for that matter) was created in 1870 with the formation of the Rowing Association of American Colleges. The RAAC hosted a de facto national championship in rowing during the period 1870ÿ1894. In 1895, Cornell, Columbia, and Penn founded the Intercollegiate Rowing Association, which remains the oldest collegiate athletic organizing body in the US. To this day, the IRA Championship Regatta determines the national champion in rowing and all of the Ivies are regularly invited to compete.\\r\\n\\r\\nA basketball league was later created in 1902, when Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Yale and Princeton formed the Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League; they were later joined by Penn and Dartmouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1906, the organization that eventually became the National Collegiate Athletic Association was formed, primarily to formalize rules for the emerging sport of football. But of the 39 original member colleges in the NCAA, only two of them (Dartmouth and Penn) later became Ivies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1903, intercollegiate wrestling began when Yale accepted a challenge from Columbia, published in the Yale News. The dual meet took place prior to a basketball game hosted by Columbia and resulted in a tie. Two years later, Penn and Princeton also added wrestling teams, leading to the formation of the student-run Intercollegiate Wrestling Association, now the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association (EIWA), the first and oldest collegiate wrestling league in the US.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1930, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Penn, Princeton and Yale formed the Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League; they were later joined by Harvard, Brown, Army and Navy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the formal establishment of the Ivy League, there was an \\"unwritten and unspoken agreement among certain Eastern colleges on athletic relations\\". The earliest reference to the \\"Ivy colleges\\" came in 1933, when Stanley Woodward of the New York Herald Tribune used it to refer to the eight current members plus Army.[3]  In 1935, the Associated Press reported on an example of collaboration between the schools:\\r\\nThe athletic authorities of the so-called \\"Ivy League\\" are considering drastic measures to curb the increasing tendency toward riotous attacks on goal posts and other encroachments by spectators on playing fields.\\r\\nDespite such collaboration, the universities did not seem to consider the formation of the league as imminent. Romeyn Berry, Cornell's manager of athletics, reported the situation in January 1936 as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nI can say with certainty that in the last five yearsand markedly in the last three monthsthere has been a strong drift among the eight or ten universities of the East which see a good deal of one another in sport toward a closer bond of confidence and cooperation and toward the formation of a common front against the threat of a breakdown in the ideals of amateur sport in the interests of supposed expediency.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease do not regard that statement as implying the organization of an Eastern conference or even a poetic \\"Ivy League\\". That sort of thing does not seem to be in the cards at the moment.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin a year of this statement and having held month-long discussions about the proposal, on December 3, 1936, the idea of \\"the formation of an Ivy League\\" gained enough traction among the undergraduate bodies of the universities that the Columbia Daily Spectator, The Cornell Daily Sun, The Dartmouth, The Harvard Crimson, The Daily Pennsylvanian, The Daily Princetonian and the Yale Daily News would simultaneously run an editorial entitled \\"Now Is the Time\\", encouraging the seven universities to form the league in an effort to preserve the ideals of athletics.[51] Part of the editorial read as follows:\\r\\nThe Ivy League exists already in the minds of a good many of those connected with football, and we fail to see why the seven schools concerned should be satisfied to let it exist as a purely nebulous entity where there are so many practical benefits which would be possible under definite organized association. The seven colleges involved fall naturally together by reason of their common interests and similar general standards and by dint of their established national reputation they are in a particularly advantageous position to assume leadership for the preservation of the ideals of intercollegiate athletics.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ivies have been competing in sports as long as intercollegiate sports have existed in the United States. Rowing teams from Harvard and Yale met in the first sporting event held between students of two U.S. colleges on Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire, on August 3, 1852. Harvard's team, \\"The Oneida\\", won the race and was presented with trophy black walnut oars from then presidential nominee General Franklin Pierce.\\r\\nThe proposal did not succeedon January 11, 1937, the athletic authorities at the schools rejected the \\"possibility of a heptagonal league in football such as these institutions maintain in basketball, baseball and track.\\" However, they noted that the league \\"has such promising possibilities that it may not be dismissed and must be the subject of further consideration.\\"[53]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1945 the presidents of the eight schools signed the first Ivy Group Agreement, which set academic, financial, and athletic standards for the football teams. The principles established reiterated those put forward in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Presidents' Agreement of 1916. The Ivy Group Agreement established the core tenet that an applicant's ability to play on a team would not influence admissions decisions:\\r\\nThe members of the Group reaffirm their prohibition of athletic scholarships. Athletes shall be admitted as students and awarded financial aid only on the basis of the same academic standards and economic need as are applied to all other students.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1954, the presidents extended the Ivy Group Agreement to all intercollegiate sports, effective with the 1955ÿ56 basketball season. This is generally reckoned as the formal formation of the Ivy League. As part of the transition, Brown, the only Ivy that hadn't joined the EIBL, did so for the 1954ÿ55 season. A year later, the Ivy League absorbed the EIBL. The Ivy League claims the EIBL's history as its own. Through the EIBL, it is the oldest basketball conference in Division I.[55][56]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs late as the 1960s many of the Ivy League universities' undergraduate programs remained open only to men, with Cornell the only one to have been coeducational from its founding (1865) and Columbia being the last (1983) to become coeducational. Before they became coeducational, many of the Ivy schools maintained extensive social ties with nearby Seven Sisters women's colleges, including weekend visits, dances and parties inviting Ivy and Seven Sisters students to mingle. This was the case not only at Barnard College and Radcliffe College, which are adjacent to Columbia and Harvard, but at more distant institutions as well. The movie Animal House includes a satiric version of the formerly common visits by Dartmouth men to Massachusetts to meet Smith and Mount Holyoke women, a drive of more than two hours. As noted by Irene Harwarth, Mindi Maline, and Elizabeth DeBra, \\"The 'Seven Sisters' was the name given to Barnard, Smith, Mount Holyoke, Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, and Radcliffe, because of their parallel to the Ivy League mens colleges.\\"[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1982 the Ivy League considered adding two members, with Army, Navy, and Northwestern as the most likely candidates; if it had done so, the league could probably have avoided being moved into the recently created Division I-AA (now Division I FCS) for football.[58] In 1983, following the admission of women to Columbia College, Columbia University and Barnard College entered into an athletic consortium agreement by which students from both schools compete together on Columbia University women's athletic teams, which replaced the women's teams previously sponsored by Barnard.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Army and Navy departed the Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League in 1992, all intercollegiate competition involving the eight schools became united under the Ivy League banner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ivy League schools are highly selective, with acceptance rates since 2000 ranging from 6 to 16 percent at each of the universities. Admitted students come from around the world, although students from New England and the Northeastern United States make up a significant proportion of students.[67][68][69]\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of the League have been highly ranked by various university rankings.  In addition to the broad rankings listed in the accompanying chart, several Ivy League schools are highly ranked in the current 2018 US News & World Report assessment of Best Undergraduate Teaching:  1. Princeton; 2. Dartmouth; 3. Brown; 10. Yale.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther, Ivy League members have produced many Nobel laureates, winners of the Nobel Prize and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. According to the Nobel Foundation's website, as of 2016 the number of prize-winners affiliated with each Ivy League university at the time of their awards is: Brown, 2; Columbia, 17; Cornell, 8; Dartmouth, 0; Harvard, 36; Penn, 4; Princeton, 14; and Yale, 8.[74] In addition, each university self-reports their number of affiliated Nobel laureates, but they use varying definitions for which Nobel winners they claim (for example, alumni, active faculty, former faculty, visiting faculty, adjunct faculty, etc.)\\r\\n\\r\\nCollaboration between the member schools is illustrated by the student-led Ivy Council that meets in the fall and spring of each year, with representatives from every Ivy League school. The governing body of the Ivy League is the Council of Ivy Group Presidents, composed of each university president. During meetings, the presidents often discuss common procedures and initiatives for the universities.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent fashion trends and styles have emerged from Ivy League campuses over time, and fashion trends such as Ivy League and Preppy are styles often associated with the Ivy League and its culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIvy League style is a style of men's dress, popular during the late 1950s, believed to have originated on Ivy League campuses. The clothing stores J. Press and Brooks Brothers represent perhaps the quintessential Ivy League dress manner. The Ivy League style is said to be the predecessor to the preppy style of dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreppy fashion started around 1912 to the late 1940s and 1950s as the Ivy League style of dress.[75] J. Press represents the quintessential preppy clothing brand, stemming from the collegiate traditions that shaped the preppy subculture. In the mid-twentieth century J. Press and Brooks Brothers, both being pioneers in preppy fashion, had stores on Ivy League school campuses, including Harvard, Princeton, and Yale.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome typical preppy styles also reflect traditional upper class New England leisure activities, such as equestrian, sailing or yachting, hunting, fencing, rowing, lacrosse, tennis, golf, and rugby. Longtime New England outdoor outfitters, such as L.L. Bean,[76] became part of conventional preppy style. This can be seen in sport stripes and colours, equestrian clothing, plaid shirts, field jackets and nautical-themed accessories. Vacationing in Palm Beach, Florida, long popular with the East Coast upper class, led to the emergence of bright colour combinations in leisure wear seen in some brands such as Lilly Pulitzer.[76] By the 1980s, other brands such as Lacoste, Izod[77] and Dooney & Bourke became associated with preppy style.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, these styles continue to be popular on Ivy League campuses, throughout the U.S., and abroad, and are oftentimes labeled as \\"Classic American style\\" or \\"Traditional American style\\".[78][79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ivy League is often associated with the upper class White Anglo-Saxon Protestant community of the Northeast, Old Money, or more generally, the American upper middle and upper classes.[80][81][82][83] Although most Ivy League students come from upper middle- and upper-class families, the student body has become increasingly more economically and ethnically diverse. The universities provide significant financial aid to help increase the enrollment of lower income and middle class students.[84]  Several reports suggest, however, that the proportion of students from less-affluent families remains low.[85][86]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhrases such as \\"Ivy League snobbery\\"[87] are ubiquitous in nonfiction and fiction writing of the early and mid-twentieth century. A Louis Auchincloss character dreads \\"the aridity of snobbery which he knew infected the Ivy League colleges\\".[44] A business writer, warning in 2001 against discriminatory hiring, presented a cautionary example of an attitude to avoid (the bracketed phrase is his):\\r\\n\\r\\nWe Ivy Leaguers [read: mostly white and Anglo] know that an Ivy League degree is a mark of the kind of person who is likely to succeed in this organization.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrase Ivy League historically has been perceived as connected not only with academic excellence, but also with social elitism. In 1936, sportswriter John Kieran noted that student editors at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell, Columbia, Dartmouth, and Penn were advocating the formation of an athletic association. In urging them to consider \\"Army and Navy and Georgetown and Fordham and Syracuse and Brown and Pitt\\" as candidates for membership, he exhorted:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be well for the proponents of the Ivy League to make it clear (to themselves especially) that the proposed group would be inclusive but not \\"exclusive\\" as this term is used with a slight up-tilting of the tip of the nose.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nAspects of Ivy stereotyping were illustrated during the 1988 presidential election, when George H. W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis (graduate of Harvard Law School) for having \\"foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique.\\"[90] New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd asked \\"Wasn't this a case of the pot calling the kettle elite?\\" Bush explained, however, that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was \\"so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it.... Harvard boutique to me has the connotation of liberalism and elitism\\" and said Harvard in his remark was intended to represent \\"a philosophical enclave\\" and not a statement about class.[91] Columnist Russell Baker opined that \\"Voters inclined to loathe and fear elite Ivy League schools rarely make fine distinctions between Yale and Harvard. All they know is that both are full of rich, fancy, stuck-up and possibly dangerous intellectuals who never sit down to supper in their undershirt no matter how hot the weather gets.\\"[92] Still, the last five presidents have all attended Ivy League schools for at least part of their education George H. W. Bush (Yale undergrad), Bill Clinton (Yale Law School), George W. Bush (Yale undergrad, Harvard Business School), Barack Obama (Columbia undergrad, Harvard Law School), and Donald Trump (Penn undergrad).\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the 45 men who have served as President of the United States, 16 have graduated from an Ivy League university. Of them, eight have degrees from Harvard, five from Yale, three from Columbia, two from Princeton and one from Penn. Twelve presidents have earned Ivy undergraduate degrees.  Three of these were transfer students:  Donald Trump transferred from Fordham University, Barack Obama transferred from Occidental College and John F. Kennedy transferred from another Ivy, Princeton, where he had been class of 1939. John Adams was the first president to graduate from college, graduating from Harvard in 1755.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents of the Ivy League largely hail from the Northeast, largely from the New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia areas. As all eight Ivy League universities are within the Northeast, it is no surprise that most graduates end up working and residing in the Northeast after graduation. An unscientific survey of Harvard seniors from the Class of 2013 found that 42% hailed from the Northeast and 55% overall were planning on working and residing in the Northeast.[97] Boston and New York City are traditionally where many Ivy League graduates end up living.[98][99][100][101]\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents of the Ivy League, both graduate and undergraduate, come primarily from upper middle and upper class families. In recent years, however, the universities have looked towards increasing socioeconomic and class diversity, by providing greater financial aid packages to applicants from lower, working, and middle class American families.[84][102]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, 46% of Harvard undergraduate students came from families in the top 3.8% of all American households (i.e., over $200,000 annual income).[102] In 2012, the bottom 25% of the American income distribution accounted for only 3ÿ4% of students at Brown, a figure that had remained unchanged since 1992.[103] In 2014, 69% of incoming freshmen students at Yale College came from families with annual incomes of over $120,000, putting most Yale College students in the upper middle and/or upper class. (The median household income in the U.S. in 2013 was $52,700.)[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2011ÿ2012 academic year, students qualifying for Pell Grants (federally funded scholarships on the basis of need) comprised 20% at Harvard, 18% at Cornell, 17% at Penn, 16% at Columbia, 15% at Dartmouth and Brown, 14% at Yale, and 12% at Princeton. Nationally, 35% of American university students qualify for a Pell Grant.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nIvy champions are recognized in sixteen men's and sixteen women's sports. In some sports, Ivy teams actually compete as members of another league, the Ivy championship being decided by isolating the members' records in play against each other; for example, the six league members who participate in ice hockey do so as members of ECAC Hockey, but an Ivy champion is extrapolated each year. The Ivy League was the last Division I basketball conference to institute a conference postseason tournament; the first tournaments for men and women were held at the end of the 2016ÿ17 season. The tournaments only award the Ivy League automatic bids for the NCAA Division?I Men's and Women's Basketball Tournaments; the official conference championships continue to be awarded based solely on regular-season results.[106] Before the 2016ÿ17 season, the automatic bids were based solely on regular-season record, with a one-game playoff (or series of one-game playoffs if more than two teams were tied) held to determine the automatic bid.[107] The Ivy League is one of only two Division I conferences which award their official basketball championships solely on regular-season results; the other is the Southeastern Conference.[108][109] Since its inception, an Ivy League school has yet to win either the men's or women's Division I NCAA Basketball Tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn average, each Ivy school has more than 35 varsity teams. All eight are in the top 20 for number of sports offered for both men and women among Division I schools. Unlike most Division I athletic conferences, the Ivy League prohibits the granting of athletic scholarships; all scholarships awarded are need-based (financial aid).[110] In addition, the Ivies have a rigid policy against redshirting, even for medical reasons; an athlete loses a year of eligibility for every year enrolled at an Ivy institution.[111] Ivy League teams' non-league games are often against the members of the Patriot League, which have similar academic standards and athletic scholarship policies (although unlike the Ivies, the Patriot League allows redshirting).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the time before recruiting for college sports became dominated by those offering athletic scholarships and lowered academic standards for athletes, the Ivy League was successful in many sports relative to other universities in the country. In particular, Princeton won 26 recognized national championships in college football (last in 1935), and Yale won 18 (last in 1927).[112] Both of these totals are considerably higher than those of other historically strong programs such as Alabama, which has won 15, Notre Dame, which claims 11 but is credited by many sources with 13, and USC, which has won 11. Yale, whose coach Walter Camp was the \\"Father of American Football,\\" held on to its place as the all-time wins leader in college football throughout the entire 20th century, but was finally passed by Michigan on November 10, 2001. Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Penn each have over a dozen former scholar-athletes enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. Currently Dartmouth holds the record for most Ivy League football titles, with 18, followed closely by Harvard and Penn, each with 17 titles. In addition, the Ivy League has produced Super Bowl winners Kevin Boothe (Cornell), two-time Pro Bowler Zak DeOssie (Brown), Sean Morey (Brown), All-Pro selection Matt Birk (Harvard), Calvin Hill (Yale), Derrick Harmon (Cornell) and 1999 \\"Mr. Irrelevant\\" Jim Finn (Penn).\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning with the 1982 football season, the Ivy League has competed in Division I-AA (renamed FCS in 2006).[113] The Ivy League teams are eligible for the FCS tournament held to determine the national champion, and the league champion is eligible for an automatic bid (and any other team may qualify for an at-large selection) from the NCAA.  However, the Ivy League has not played any postseason games at all since 1956 due to the league's concerns about the extended December schedule's effects on academics.  For this reason, any Ivy League team invited to the FCS playoffs turns down the bid.  The Ivy League plays a strict 10-game schedule, compared to other FCS members' schedules of 11 (or, in some seasons, 12) regular season games, plus post-season, which was most recently expanded in 2013 to five rounds with 24 teams, with a bye week for the top eight teams.  Football is the only sport in which the Ivy League declines to compete for a national title.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to varsity football, Penn, Princeton and Cornell also field teams in the eight-team Collegiate Sprint Football League, in which all players must weigh 172 pounds or less. Penn and Princeton are the last remaining founding members of the league from its 1934 debut, and Cornell is the next-oldest, joining in 1937. Yale and Columbia previously fielded teams in the league but no longer do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ivy League is home to some of the oldest college rugby teams in the United States. Although these teams are not \\"varsity\\" sports, they compete annually in the Ivy Rugby Conference.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table above includes the number of team championships won from the beginning of official Ivy League competition (1956ÿ57 academic year) through 2016-17. Princeton and Harvard have on occasion won ten or more Ivy League titles in a year, an achievement accomplished 10 times by Harvard and 24 times by Princeton, including a conference-record 15 championships in 2010ÿ11. Only once has one of the other six schools earned more than eight titles in a single academic year (Cornell with nine in 2005ÿ06). In the 38 academic years beginning 1979ÿ80, Princeton has averaged 10 championships per year, one-third of the conference total of 33 sponsored sports.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 12 academic years beginning 2005ÿ06 Princeton has won championships in 31 different sports, all except wrestling and men's tennis.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nRivalries run deep in the Ivy League. For instance, Princeton and Penn are longstanding men's basketball rivals;[117] \\"Puck Frinceton\\" T-shirts are worn by Quaker fans at games.[118] In only 11 instances in the history of Ivy League basketball, and in only seven seasons since Yale's 1962 title, has neither Penn nor Princeton won at least a share of the Ivy League title in basketball,[119] with Princeton champion or co-champion 26 times and Penn 25 times. Penn has won 21 outright, Princeton 19 outright. Princeton has been a co-champion 7 times, sharing 4 of those titles with Penn (these 4 seasons represent the only times Penn has been co-champion). Harvard won its first title of either variety in 2011, losing a dramatic play-off game to Princeton for the NCAA tournament bid, then rebounded to win outright championships in 2012, 2013, and 2014. Harvard also won the 2013 Great Alaska Shootout, defeating TCU to become the only Ivy League school to win the now-defunct tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nRivalries exist between other Ivy league teams in other sports, including Cornell and Harvard in hockey, Harvard and Princeton in swimming, and Harvard and Penn in football (Penn and Harvard have won 28 Ivy League Football Championships since 1982, Penn-16; Harvard-12). During that time Penn has had 8 undefeated Ivy League Football Championships and Harvard has had 6 undefeated Ivy League Football Championships.[120] In men's lacrosse, Cornell and Princeton are perennial rivals, and they are the only two Ivy League teams to have won the NCAA tournament. In 2009, the Big Red and Tigers met for their 70th game in the NCAA tournament.[121] No team other than Harvard or Princeton has won the men's swimming conference title outright since 1972, although Yale, Columbia, and Cornell have shared the title with Harvard and Princeton during this time.  Similarly, no program other than Princeton and Harvard has won the women's swimming championship since Brown's 1999 title.  Princeton or Cornell has won every indoor and outdoor track and field championship, both men's and women's, every year since 2002ÿ03, with one exception (Columbia women won indoor championship in 2012).  Harvard and Yale are football and crew rivals although the competition has become unbalanced; Harvard has won all but one of the last 15 football games and all but one of the last 13 crew races.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Yale-Princeton series is the nation's second longest, exceeded only by \\"The Rivalry\\" between Lehigh and Lafayette, which began later in 1884 but included two or three games in each of 17 early seasons.[122]  For the first three decades of the Yale-Princeton rivalry, the two played their season-ending game at a neutral site, usually New York City, and with one exception (1890: Harvard), the winner of the game also won at least a share of the national championship that year, covering the period 1869 through 1903.[123][124]  This phenomenon of a finale contest at a neutral site for the national title created a social occasion for the society elite of the metropolitan area akin to a Super Bowl in the era prior to the establishment of the NFL in 1920.[125][126] These football games were also financially profitable for the two universities, so much that they began to play baseball games in New York City as well, drawing record crowds for that sport also, largely from the same social demographic.[127] In a period when the only professional sports were fledgling baseball leagues, these high-profile early contests between Princeton and Yale played a role in popularizing spectator sports, demonstrating their financial potential and raising public awareness of Ivy universities at a time when few people attended college.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis list, which is current through July 1, 2015,[128] includes NCAA championships and women's AIAW championships  (one each for Yale and Dartmouth).  Excluded from this list are all other national championships earned outside the scope of NCAA competition, including football titles and retroactive Helms Foundation titles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term Ivy is often used to connote a positive comparison to or association with the Ivy League, often along academic lines. The term has been used to describe the Little Ivies, a grouping of small liberal arts colleges in the Northeastern United States.[131] Other uses include the Southern Ivies, Hidden Ivies, and the Public Ivies. The 2007 edition of Newsweek's How to Get Into College Now, the editors designated 25 schools as \\"New Ivies\\".[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term Ivy Plus is sometimes used to refer to the Ancient Eight plus several other schools for purposes of alumni associations,[133][134] university affiliations,[134][135][136][137] or endowment comparisons.[138][139][140][141] In his book Untangling the Ivy League, Zawel writes, \\"The inclusion of nonÿIvy League schools under this term is commonplace for some schools and extremely rare for others. Among these other schools, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University are almost always included. The University of Chicago and Duke University are often included as well.\\"[134] In their 2015 book Acing Admissions, Mehta and Dixit write, \\"The [Ivy Plus schools] include, but are not limited to: Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Stanford University and Northwestern University.  Besides selectivity, these Ivy Plus colleges are thought to share similar values around academic and professional excellence, intellectual curiosity, leadership and civil engagement.\\"[142]","input":"What are the four original ivy league schools?"},{"output":"Oceanus Hopkins","context":"Peregrine White (c. November 20, 1620?ÿ July 20, 1704) was the first baby boy born on the Mayflower in the harbor of Massachusetts, the second baby born on the Mayflower's historic voyage, and the first known English child born to the Pilgrims in America.[1] His parents, William White and his pregnant wife Susanna, with their son Resolved White and two servants, came on the Pilgrim ship Mayflower in 1620. Peregrine White was born while the Mayflower lay at anchor in the harbor at Cape Cod. In later life he became a person of note in Plymouth Colony, active in both military and government affairs.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPeregrine White[5] was the second son of Mayflower pilgrim William White and his wife Susanna Winslow White. His mother Susanna was pregnant during the Mayflower voyage and gave birth to Peregrine in late November 1620 while the ship was anchored at Cape Cod, now Provincetown Harbor.[2][4][6]\\r\\nThe Whites are believed to have boarded the Mayflower as part of the London merchant group, and not as members of the Leiden Holland religious movement. Evidence of the William White family coming to the Mayflower from England and not Holland comes from William Bradfords Mayflower passenger list which has \\"Mr. William White\\" in his section for London merchants along with Mr. Christopher Martin, Mr. William Mullins, Mr. Stephen Hopkins, Mr. Richard Warren and John Billington. It is believed that if William White had been a member of the Leiden congregation, his name would have appeared in Bradfords work for that section, but it does not. There is no evidence to associate William White and his family with Leiden, Holland. And regarding the various White family ancestries which erroneously place the William White family in them, the Mayflower Society states that Little is known about William White.[4][7]\\r\\nThe White family, as recalled by William Bradford in 1651: Mr. William White, and Susana, his wife, and one son, called Resolved, and one borne a ship-bord, called Peregrine; and *2* servants, named William Holbeck and Edward Thomson.[8]\\r\\nThe Mayflower departed Plymouth, England on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ships timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.[9]\\r\\nAt some point along the journey, the first baby was born on the Mayflower, Oceanus Hopkins, to the passengers Stephen and Elizabeth Hopkins.\\r\\nOn November 9/19, 1620, after about 3 months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day.[9][10][11]\\r\\nPeregrine Whites father William White, died on February 21, 1621. With her husband's death, Susanna, with her newborn son Peregrine and five-year-old Resolved, became the only surviving widow out of the many families who perished that first winter. On May 12, 1621 Peregrines mother Susanna married widower Edward Winslow, a Mayflower and later a Plymouth colony notable with whom she had five children, one of whom was Josiah Winslow, future Plymouth governor.[2][4][12][13]\\r\\nIn the 1627 Division of Cattle, both Resolved (sic) and his brother Peregrine were listed in the Third Lot under Capt. Standish in the family of Edward Winslow, his wife Susanna and their sons Edward and John Winslow.[2][14]\\r\\nIn 1636, the family, now numbering 6 - Edward and Susanna, Resolved and Peregrine White, and the two children born to Edward and Susanna, Josias and Elizabeth Winslow - moved to the new settlement of Marshfield, north of Plymouth.[15]\\r\\nPeregrine served in the militia at age 16 and continued to serve, first as a lieutenant and then a captain. He was also a farmer. At some point he also served his community as a representative to the General Court.[16]\\r\\nOn October 23, 1643 Peregrine White at Marshfield sold to Mannasses Kempton of Plymouth, land at Eel River given to him the previous year by his stepfather Edward Winslow.[17]\\r\\nAt the court on March 6, 1648/9, Peregrine White and Sarah his wife, both of Marshfield, were presented (fined) for fornication before marriage. Since records show their first child, Daniel, was born in 1649, they seemingly married after becoming pregnant.[17][18]\\r\\nPeregrine's in-laws, the Bassets, had a great deal of land in Marshfield and Peregrine and Sarah moved there, eventually buying several adjacent pieces of property as the years progressed.[16]\\r\\nOn June 3, 1651, Lt. Peregrine White was admitted as a Freeman.[17]\\r\\nOn June 3, 1652 William Bassett Sr. of Duxburrow gave his son-in-law Lt. Peregrine White 40 acres of upland.[15]\\r\\nIn 1655 he was granted land as the first of the English that was borne in these ptes.[19]\\r\\nOn June 16, 1656 as written, William Bassett Sr. of Duxborrow (sic), now living at Bridgewater, gave his lands in Scituate to his sons Peregrine White and Nathaniel Bassett.[17]\\r\\nOn October 2, 1658 he was chosen to the council of war.[17]\\r\\nOn June 3, 1662 Peregrine was chosen deputy for Marshfield.[17]\\r\\nOn March 4, 1673/4 Lt. Peregrine White was granted 100 acres at Titicut.[20][21]\\r\\nOn August 19, 1674 Peregrine White of Marshfield deeded son Daniel White, in consideration of his intended marriage, various buildings and lands in Marshfield from the time of his death, except if he died before his wife Sarah and Daniel was to pay monies to sister Sarah and Mercy when they became or married.[21]\\r\\nOn May 22, 1696 Capt. Peregrine White the first born Child of New England born November 1620 was admitted into the Marshfield Church in his 78th year. At age 78, Peregrine officially joined the Marshfield church.[21]\\r\\nPeregrine White married before March 6, 1648/9 Sarah Bassett, daughter of William and Elizabeth/Elisabeth Bassett.[22] William Bassett came to Plymouth in 1621 on the Fortune as a single man, but by the 1623 division was allotted two acres showing he had married before that date. Bassetts name as Wm Bassett, Sen appears on the 1643 Able to Bear Arms list for Duxborrow (sic). William Bassett became a Plymouth Colony person of historic note.[4][23][24]\\r\\nSarah Bassett was born in Plymouth c.1630 and died in Marshfield January 22, 1711. They had seven children between c.1649 and c.1670.[15][25]\\r\\nChildren of Peregrine White and his wife Sarah:\\r\\nIn 1704 - The will of Peregrine White (which is owned by and displayed at Pilgrim Hall in Plymouth), dated July 14, 1704 and proved August 14 of the same year states: Peregrine White of Marshfield..Being aged and under many Weaknesses and Bodily Infirmities devised to his wife Sarah everything not otherwise disposed of by the will to his eldest son Daniel personal items and land .. as well as various personal items and land to daughters Sarah and Mercy and sons Jonathan and Peregrine. His will was signed with the initials PW The mark of Peregrine White who was then aged almost 84 years.[33][34]\\r\\nPeregrine White died on July 20, 1704 in Marshfield, Massachusetts at age 83 years and 8 months. He was buried in Winslow Cemetery in Marshfield, Massachusetts. His wife Sarah died on January 22, 1711 and was also buried in Winslow Cemetery. Additionally, Peregrines elder brother Resolved White, his wife Judith and their mother Susanna were all buried in Winslow Cemetery. Winslow Cemetery has a substantial stone monument to The Early Settlers of Green Harbor Marshfield naming, among others, Resolved and Peregrine White, their wives and mother Susanna as well as her second husband Edward Winslow.[4][15][25][35]\\r\\nMarshfield vital records note the death of Capt.

Confucian ideas provided the foundation for a system of strict social prescriptions. At the top of the social order, although below the Emperor, the shgun, daimys (lords), and the samurai were the ruling class. The peasants (heimin) lived in villages and produced agricultural goods. Increasing urbanization and rising consumerism created merchant and artisan classes in towns and cities. Social mobility during this period was highly limited. As wealth became concentrated outside of the samurai class, conflicts between class arose and the social order became increasingly challenged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tokugawa government intentionally created a social order called the Four divisions of society (shinksh), that would stabilize the country. This system was based on the ideas of Confucianism that spread to Japan from China. By this system, society was composed of samurai ( shi), farming peasants ( n), artisans (W k) and merchants (j sh). Samurai were placed at the top of society because they started an order and set a high moral example for others to follow. The system was meant to reinforce their position of power in society by justifying their ruling status. Peasants came second because they produced the most important commodity, food. According to Confucian philosophy, society could not survive without agriculture.[1] Third were artisans because they produced nonessential goods.\\r\\nMerchants were at the bottom of the social order because they generated wealth without producing any goods. As this indicates, the classes were not arranged by wealth or capital but by what philosophers described as their moral purity.\\r\\nIn actuality, shinksh does not accurately describe Tokugawa society.[2] Buddhist and Shinto priests; or court nobles (kuge); and outcast classes including eta and hinin (those sold or sentenced into indentured servitude) were not included in this description of hierarchy. In some cases, a poor samurai could be little better off than a peasant and the lines between the classes could blur, especially between artisans and merchants in urban areas. Still, the theory provided grounds for restricting privileges and responsibilities to different classes and it gave a sense of order to society. In practice, solidified social relationships in general helped create the political stability that defined the Edo period. [3]\\r\\nSamurai functioned as the warrior class in Japan; they constituted about 7ÿ8% of the population. The other classes were prohibited from possessing long swords such as the tachi or katana. Carrying both a long and a short sword became the symbol of the samurai class.\\r\\nDuring the feudal period, samurai were warriors that fought for a lord in a feudal relationship. The Edo period, however, was largely free from both external threats and internal conflicts. Instead, the samurai maintained their fighting skills more as an art than to fight. Samurai were paid a stipend from their lord, limiting their ties to the economic base. In addition, samurai could not own land, which would have given them income independent from their duty. Samurai generally lived around their daimy's castle, creating a thriving town or city environment around the middle of a domain.\\r\\nThere were social stratifications within the samurai class. Upper-level samurai had direct access to their daimy and could hold his most trusted positions. Some achieved a level of wealth that allowed them to retain their own samurai vassals. Mid-level samurai held military and bureaucratic positions and had some interactions with their daimy if needed. Low-level samurai could be paid as little as a subsistence wage and worked as guards, messengers and clerks. Positions within the class were largely hereditary and talented samurai could not rise above a few social steps beyond their birth.[4]\\r\\nOutside the traditional samuraiÿlord relationship were rnin, or masterless samurai were generally afforded very low levels of respect, had no income, and often became gamblers, bandits, or other similar occupations.\\r\\nLife for rural peasants focused on their villages. Peasants rarely moved beyond their villages, and journeys and pilgrimages required a permit, but young people occasionally sought seasonal employment outside of their village. As a result, people were highly suspicious of outsiders. Social bonding, critical to the survival of the whole village, also reinforced through seasonal festivals. Villages were highly collective; there were strong pressures to conform and no room to deviate from custom.[5] Though there were conflicts, they were seen as disruptive to the village and order and were to be limited as much as possible.[6]\\r\\nThe peasant class owned land, but rights to tax this land were given to the daimy. Peasants worked to produce enough food for themselves and still meet the tax burden. Most agriculture during this time was cultivated by families on their own land in contrast to the plantation or hacienda model, implemented elsewhere.[7]\\r\\nPeasants could amass relatively large amounts of wealth but remained in the same class because of their association with the land. Wealthier families and those that held their own land and paid taxes were held in much higher regard and had more political influence in village matters. However, the survival of the village depended on every household cooperating to meet the tax burden and overcome natural disasters such as famines. During the reign of the third Tokugawa shgun, Iemitsu, farmers were not allowed to eat any of the rice they grew. They had to hand it all over to their daimyo and then wait for him to give some back as charity.\\r\\nBy 1800, as much as 10% of the population of Japan may have lived in large towns and cities, one of the highest levels in the world at the time.[8] The daimys and their samurai did not produce any goods themselves, but they used the tax surplus from the land to fuel their consumption. Their needs were met by artisans, who moved to be around the castles, and merchants, who traded local and regional goods. Each class in the city was restricted to living in its own quarter.\\r\\nMerchants grew increasingly powerful during this period. Wealthy merchant houses arose to organize distributors and hold legal monopolies. As their wealth grew, merchants wanted to consume and display their wealth in the same manner as the samurai, but laws prevented them from doing so overtly. Still, their consumption combined with that of the samurai served to reinforce the growth of the merchant and artisan classes.\\r\\nA woman's life varied immensely according to her family's social status. Women in samurai families were expected to submit to their male heads of household, but as they aged, they could become the ranking household member if their husband died. Children were enjoined to respect both of their parents, even as adults. Women from the lower classes were much less restricted by social expectations and could play an integral part in the family's business.[9] Peasant women were expected to do household chores in the early morning before working in the fields with their male relatives and, regardless of age, were important, working members of their families.\\r\\nMarriage was not based on romantic attraction. Families tried to use marriage as a way to increase their social standing or, among wealthier groups, to increase one's influence and holdings. Most often, however, marriage occurred between two families of equal status.[10] Female virginity at marriage was important in the samurai classes; it was much less important to the lower classes.[11] After marriage, women were restricted from taking additional sexual partners. Males of the upper classes, however, were able to take concubines and have relations with unmarried women. Divorce was common, and a woman from a poor household could very easily leave her husband and return to her original family.\\r\\nThe foundation of this period was its stable social order. However, as wealth became increasingly concentrated outside of the samurai class, social conflict grew. The fixed stipends on which samurai lived did not increase despite the rising cost of commodities and the increasingly burdensome cost of proper social etiquette so many samurai became in debt to wealthy merchant families. The wealthy merchants, in turn, were restricted from showing their wealth for fear of violating the laws that restricted privileges to the samurai class. That created deepening resentment but also increasing interdependence between the two classes.[12] Some scholars began to question the Confucian beliefs that provided the foundation of society.[13]\\r\\nChanges in rural areas were also creating conflict. New technology increased productivity and allowed some families to produce a surplus of food that could be used to support ventures beyond farming. Some peasants also became indebted to their wealthier neighbors, and more families lost ownership of their land. This sparked resentment that sometimes erupted in violence towards landlords and village elite.\\r\\nThe challenges laid the foundation for the changes that would follow during the Meiji period.","input":"What role did samurai play in japanese society?"},{"output":"theocracy","context":"The politics of Iran take place in a framework of a theocracy in a format of syncretic politics that is guided by Islamic ideology. The December 1979 constitution, and its 1989 amendment, define the political, economic, and social order of the Islamic Republic of Iran, declaring that Shia Islam of the Twelver school of thought is Iran's official religion.\\r\\nIran has an elected president, parliament (or Majlis), \\"Assembly of Experts\\" (which elects the Supreme Leader), and local councils. According to the constitution all candidates running for these positions must be vetted by the Guardian Council before being elected.\\r\\nIn addition, there are representatives elected from appointed organizations (usually under the Supreme Leader's control) to \\"protect the state's Islamic character\\".[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early days of the revolutionary government were characterized by political tumult. In November 1979 the American embassy was seized and its occupants taken hostage and kept captive for 444 days because of support of the American Government to the King of Iran (Shah of Iran). The eight-year IranÿIraq War killed hundreds of thousands and cost the country billions of dollars. By mid-1982, power struggles eliminated first the center of political spectrum and then the Republicans[2][3][4] leaving the revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini and his supporters in power.\\r\\nIran's post-revolution challenges have included the imposition of economic sanctions and suspension of diplomatic relations with Iran by the United States because of the hostage crisis, political support to Iraq and other acts of terrorism that the U.S. government and some others have accused Iran of sponsoring. Emigration has lost Iran millions of entrepreneurs, professionals, technicians, and skilled craftspeople and their capital.\\"[5][6] For this and other reasons Iran's economy has not prospered.[citation needed] Poverty rose in absolute terms by nearly 45% during the first 6 years since Iraqi invasion on Iran started[7] and per capita income has yet to reach pre-revolutionary levels when Iraqi invasion ended in 1988.[8][9]\\r\\nThe Islamic Republic Party was Iran's ruling political party and for years its only political party until its dissolution in 1987. After the war, new reformist/progressive parties had started to form. The country had no functioning political parties until the Executives of Construction Party formed in 1994 to run for the fifth parliamentary elections, mainly out of executive body of the government close to the then-president Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. After the election of Mohammad Khatami in 1997, more parties started to work, mostly of the reformist movement and opposed by hard-liners. This led to incorporation and official activity of many other groups, including hard-liners. After the war ended in 1988, reformist and progressive candidates won four out of six presidential elections in Iran and Right-wing nationalist party of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won twice.\\r\\nThe Iranian Government is opposed by several Militias, including the Mojahedin-e-Khalq, the People's Fedayeen, and the Kurdish Democratic Party. For other political parties see List of political parties in Iran.\\r\\nThe Supreme Leader of Iran[10] is the head of state and highest ranking political and religious authority in the Islamic Republic of Iran (above the President). The armed forces, judicial system, state television, and other key governmental organizations are under the control of the Supreme Leader. There have been only two Supreme Leaders since the founding of the Islamic Republic, and the current leader (Ali Khamenei), has been in power since 1989. His powers extend to issuing decrees and making final decisions on the economy, environment, foreign policy, education, national planning of population growth,[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] the amount of transparency in elections in Iran,[19] and who is to be fired and reinstated in the Presidential cabinet.[20][21]\\r\\nThe Supreme Leader is appointed and supervised by the Assembly of Experts. However, all candidates to the Assembly of Experts, the President and the Majlis (Parliament), are selected by the Guardian Council, half of whose members are selected by the Supreme Leader of Iran.[22] Also, all directly-elected members after the vetting process by the Guardian Council still have to be approved by the Supreme Leader.[23][24] As such, the Assembly has never questioned the Supreme Leader.[25]\\r\\nThe Guardian Council is an appointed and constitutionally mandated 12-member council with considerable power. It approves or vetoes legislative bills from the Islamic Consultative Assembly (the Iranian Parliament), and approves or forbids candidates seeking office to the Assembly of Experts, the Presidency and the parliament,[26] Six of the twelve members are Islamic faqihs (expert in Islamic Law) selected by the Supreme Leader of Iran, and the other six are jurists nominated by the Head of the Judicial system (who is also appointed by the Supreme Leader),[27], and approved by the Iranian Parliament.[28]\\r\\nThese are the most recent elections that have taken place.\\r\\nActive student groups include the pro-reform \\"Office for Strengthening Unity\\" and \\"the Union of Islamic Student Societies';\\r\\nThe military and the Corps of the Guardians (often mistranslated as guards) of the Islamic Revolution (or Sepaah in Persian meaning the Corps) are charged with defending Iran's borders and Baseej (Persian for Mobilization) militia are charged with maintaining both external and internal security.\\r\\nIran's fiscal year goes from 21 to 20 March of the following year.\\r\\nIran has two types of budget:\\r\\nIran's budget is established by the Management and Planning Organization of Iran and then proposed by the government to the parliament/Majlis. Once approved by Majlis, the bill still needs to be ratified by the Guardian Council. The bill will be sent back to the parliament for amendments if it is voted down by the Guardian Council. The Expediency Council acts as final arbiter in any dispute.[15]\\r\\nFollowing annual approval of the governments budget by Majlis, the central bank presents a detailed monetary and credit policy to the Money and Credit Council (MCC) for approval. Thereafter, major elements of these policies are incorporated into the five-year economic development plan.[31] The 5-year plan is part of \\"Vision 2025\\", a strategy for long-term sustainable growth.[32]\\r\\nA unique feature of Iran's economy is the large size of the religious foundations (called Bonyads) whose combined budgets make up more than 30% that of the central government.[33][34][35]\\r\\nSetad, another organization worth more than $95 billion, has been described as \\"secretive\\" and \\"little known\\".[36] It is not overseen by the Iranian Parliament, as that body voted in 2008 to \\"prohibit itself from monitoring organizations that the supreme leader controls, except with his permission\\". It is, however, an important factor in the Supreme Leader's power, giving him financial independence from parliament and the national budget.[36]\\r\\nThe National Development Fund of Iran (NDFI) does not depend on Iran's budget.[37] But according to the Santiago Principles, NDFI must coordinate its investment decisions and actions with the macro-economic and monetary policies of the government of Iran.\\r\\nOfficials in Iran estimate that Iran's annual oil and gas revenues could reach $250 billion by 2015 once the current projects come on stream.[38]\\r\\nIn 2004, about 45 percent of the government's budget came from exports of oil and natural gas revenues, although this varies with the fluctuations in world petroleum markets and 31 percent came from taxes and fees.[30] Overall, an estimated 50 percent of Iran's GDP was exempt from taxes in FY 2004.[39]\\r\\nAs of 2010, oil income accounts for 80% of Iran's foreign currency revenues and 60% of the nation's overall budget.[40] Any surplus revenues from the sale of crude oil and gas are to be paid into the Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF). The approved \\"total budget\\", including state owned commercial companies, was $295 billion for the same period.[41]\\r\\nThe Government seeks to increase the share of tax revenue in the budget through the implementation of the economic reform plan through more effective tax collection from businesses.\\r\\nAs of 2016, the formula set by law is that, for sales of oil at or below the budget's price assumption, 14.5% remains with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), 20% goes to the National Development Fund (NDF), 2% goes to deprived and oil-producing provinces, and 63.5% goes to the government treasury.[42]\\r\\nBecause of changes in the classification of budgetary figures, comparison of categories among different years is not possible. However, since the Revolution the government's general budget payments have averaged:[39]\\r\\nFor a breakdown of expenditures for social and economic purposes, see attached chart.\\r\\nIn FY 2004, central government expenditures were divided as follows:[39]\\r\\nAmong current expenditures, wages and salaries accounted for 36 percent; subsidies and transfers to households accounted for 22 percent (not including indirect subsidies). Earmarked expenditures totaled 13 percent of the central government total. Between FY 2000 and FY 2004, total expenditures and net lending accounted for about 26 percent of GDP.[39] According to the Vice President for Parliamentary Affairs, Iran's subsidy reforms would save 20 percent of the country's budget.[43]\\r\\nAccording to the head of the Department of Statistics of Iran, if the rules of budgeting were observed in this structure, the government could save at least 30 to 35 percent on its expenses.[44]\\r\\nIn 2013 Iran's external debts stood at $7.2 billion compared with $17.3 billion in 2012.[45] Meanwhile, Iran's banks and financial institutions total claims on the public sector (government and governmental institutions) amounted to 929 trillion IRR ($34.8 billion) in 2014, which must be reduced according to the IMF.[46][47][48] IMF estimates that public debt could be as high as 40% of GDP once government arrears to the private sector are recognized.[49]\\r\\nMoney flow chart.\\r\\nIran's balance of payment (2003-2007)\\r\\nIran's total debt service as percent of exports of goods services and income increased sixfold between 1990 and 1997\\r\\nIran's oil vs non-oil real GDP growth projections.\\r\\nMilitary expenditures (% GDP)\\r\\nUS dollar/Iranian rial exchange rate (2003-2014 est.)\\r\\nOil and gas production (1970-2030 est.)\\r\\nIranian budget process.\\r\\n(realized)\\r\\n(2007ÿ08)[51][54]\\r\\n(approved budget)\\r\\n(realized)\\r\\n(realized)\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\n1) Since 2002, the latest International Monetary Fund Guidelines on government financial statistics have been used as a model to prepare annual budgetary acts.

The Iranian Parliament also approved a total budget of $500 billion (5,170 trillion rials) that factors in $54 billion from price hikes and subsidy cuts and aside from the government (or public budget) also includes spending for state-owned companies.[58][59] The budget is based on an oil price of $80 per barrel. The value of the US dollar is estimated at IRR 10,500 for the same period. the 2011-total budget shows a 45-percent increase compared with that of 2011 which stood at $368 billion.[60]\\r\\nThe proposed budget for 2011ÿ2012 amounts to 5.1 quadrillion rials (approximately $416 billion).[61] The funding for running the government has been decreased by 5.6 percent and the government's tax revenues have been envisaged to rise by 20 percent.[61] The defense budget shows an increase of 127 percent. The government also is seeking higher sums for development, research, and health projects.[62] Approved budget of 5,660 trillion Rials $477 billion is based on an oil price of $85 per barrel and the average value of the U.S. dollar for the fiscal year has been projected to be 12,260 rials, allowing the government to gain $53.8 billion from subsidy cut.[63] The approved total state budget figure shows an 11% increase in Rial terms, in comparison to the previous year's budget. Of this amount, $134 billion relates to the government's general budget and the remaining $343 billion relates to state-owned companies and organizations. Of the $134 billion for the government's general budget, $117 billion relates to operating expenditure and $17 billion is for infrastructure developments. The government's general budget for 2012ÿ13 shows a 3.5% decline in comparison to the previous year, while the budget for state-owned companies and organisations has risen by 18.5%. Revenues from crude oil make up 37% of the state's total revenues in the budget. Revenues from taxes have been projected at 458 trillion Rials ($37 billion), which shows a 10% increase year-on-year.[64] In the first half of 2012, Iran announced in Majlis that it has taken in only 25% of its budgeted annual revenue.[65] According to Apicorp, Iran needs oil to average $127 a barrel in 2012 for its fiscal budget to break even.[66]\\r\\nIn May 2013, the Iranian parliament approved a 7.27-quadrillion-rial (about $593 billion) national budget bill for 2013ÿ14. The new national budget has forecast a 40% drop in oil revenues compared to the previous year's projected figure. The bill has set the price of oil at $95 per barrel, based on the official exchange rate of 12,260 rials for a U.S. dollar, which has been fixed by the Central Bank of Iran.[67] The budget law also includes income of 500 trillion Rials from the subsidies reform plan. Out of this amount, 410 trillion Rials is allocated for direct cash handouts to those eligible who have registered and for social funds.[68]\\r\\nIran's earmarked government spending for the year starting in March 2014 at $75 billion, calculated on an open-market exchange rate, with an overall/\\"total\\" budget ceiling estimated at about $265 billion. The draft budget estimates oil exports at about 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd). The 2014 budget assumes an average oil price of $100 per barrel, inflation at 21%, GDP growth at 3% and the official USD/IRR exchange rate at 26,000 Iranian rials.[69][70][71][72] The budget bill permits the government to use more than $35 billion in foreign finance.[73] Capital expenditure is set to rise by 9.7%.[74] The administration has set the goal of 519 trillion rials, (about $20.9 billion) government's income from implementation of the subsidy reform plan in budget bill and will be likely forced to double fuel prices.[75] In February 2014, Parliament approved a total budget bill worth 7,930 trillion rials ($319 billion at the official exchange rate).[76] The International Monetary Fund has estimated Iran needs an oil price above $130 a barrel to balance its 2015-state budget; Brent crude was below $80 a barrel in November 2014. The IMF estimated in October 2014 that Iran would run a general government deficit of $8.6 billion in 2015, at the official exchange rate, to be compensated by drawing on the National Development Fund.[77]\\r\\nIran's 2015 proposed budget is nearly $300 billion. The overall/\\"total\\" budget shows a 4% growth compared with the 2014 budget. The budget assumes that the country exports 1 million barrels per day of crude oil and 0.3 million barrels per day of gas condensates at an average price of $72 per barrel of crude.[78] The official exchange rate is projected to be on average 28,500 USD/IRR.[79] Dependency on oil exports in this overall budget bill has dropped to 25% (down from over 30% of government revenues in 2014.)[15] The plan is to increase taxation on large organizations by reducing tax evasion/exemption. The Iranian state is the biggest player in the economy, and the annual budget strongly influences the outlook of local industries and the stock market. The 2015 budget is not expected to bring much growth for many of the domestic industries.[79][80] An average oil price of $50 for the coming year would result in a deficit of $7.5 billion. The government can lower this deficit by increasing the official exchange rate but this will trigger higher inflation.[81] The proposed expenses are $58 billion including $39 billion is salary and pension payments to government employees. Proposed development expenditure amounts to $17 billion.[81] R&Ds share in the GNP is at 0.06% (where it should be 2.5% of GDP)[82][83] and industry-driven R&D is almost non?existent.[79]\\r\\nProposed government budget is 9.52-quadrillion Iranian rials (about 262 billion US dollars).[84] Assumptions made in the budget are $50 billion in foreign investment and foreign loans, 5-6% GDP growth and 11% inflation.[84] Sixty-five percent of the budget is to be financed through taxation and the remaining 35% from oil sales, based on 2.25 million barrels of oil sales per day, an average oil price of 40 dollars a barrel and US dollar-Iranian rial exchange rate at 29,970.[84]\\r\\nAccording to the sixth five-year development plan (2016-2021), the subsidy reform plan is to continue until 2021.[84]\\r\\nAn amendment to the budget was passed in August 2016. This amendment allows the government to issue debt based instruments and the use of forex reserves in an attempt to clear its debt to the private sector, including contractors, banks and insurers.[85]\\r\\nAccording to the constitution, the Guardian Council oversees and approves electoral candidates for most national elections in Iran. The Guardian Council has 12 members, six clerics, appointed by the Supreme Leader and six jurists, elected by the Majlis from among the Muslim jurists nominated by the Head of the Judicial System, who is appointed by the Supreme Leader. According to the current law, the Guardian Council approves the Assembly of Experts candidates, who in turn supervise and elect the Supreme Leader.\\r\\nThe reformists say this system creates a closed circle of power.[86] Iranian reformists, such as Mohammad-Ali Abtahi have considered this to be the core legal obstacle for the reform movement in Iran.[87][88][89][90][91]","input":"What type of government system does iran have?"},{"output":"June 1915","context":"\\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\", commonly known as \\"Prufrock\\", is the first professionally published poem by American-born, British poet T. S. Eliot (1888ÿ1965). Eliot began writing \\"Prufrock\\" in February 1910, and it was first published in the June 1915 issue of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse[2] at the instigation of Ezra Pound (1885ÿ1972). It was later printed as part of a twelve-poem pamphlet (or chapbook) titled Prufrock and Other Observations in 1917.[1] At the time of its publication, Prufrock was considered outlandish,[3] but is now seen as heralding a paradigmatic cultural shift from late 19th-century Romantic verse and Georgian lyrics to Modernism.\\r\\nThe poem's structure was heavily influenced by Eliot's extensive reading of Dante Alighieri[4] and makes several references to the Bible and other literary worksincluding William Shakespeare's plays Henry IV Part II, Twelfth Night, and Hamlet, the poetry of seventeenth-century metaphysical poet Andrew Marvell, and the nineteenth-century French Symbolists. Eliot narrates the experience of Prufrock using the stream of consciousness technique developed by his fellow Modernist writers. The poem, described as a \\"drama of literary anguish\\", is a dramatic interior monologue of an urban man, stricken with feelings of isolation and an incapability for decisive action that is said \\"to epitomize frustration and impotence of the modern individual\\" and \\"represent thwarted desires and modern disillusionment\\".[5]\\r\\nPrufrock laments his physical and intellectual inertia, the lost opportunities in his life and lack of spiritual progress, and he is haunted by reminders of unattained carnal love. With visceral feelings of weariness, regret, embarrassment, longing, emasculation, sexual frustration, a sense of decay, and an awareness of mortality, \\"Prufrock\\" has become one of the most recognised voices in modern literature.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEliot wrote \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" between February 1910 and July or August 1911. Shortly after arriving in England to attend Merton College, Oxford, Eliot was introduced to American expatriate poet Ezra Pound, who instantly deemed Eliot \\"worth watching\\" and aided the start of Eliot's career. Pound served as the overseas editor of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse and recommended to the magazine's founder, Harriet Monroe, that Poetry publish \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\", extolling that Eliot and his work embodied a new and unique phenomenon among contemporary writers. Pound claimed that Eliot \\"has actually trained himself AND modernized himself ON HIS OWN. The rest of the promising young have done one or the other, but never both.\\"[7] The poem was first published by the magazine in its June 1915 issue.[2][8]\\r\\nIn November 1915 \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\"along with Eliot's poems \\"Portrait of a Lady,\\" \\"The Boston Evening Transcript,\\" \\"Hysteria,\\" and \\"Miss Helen Slingsby\\"was included in Catholic Anthology 1914ÿ1915 edited by Ezra Pound and printed by Elkin Mathews in London.[9]:297 In June 1917 The Egoist, a small publishing firm run by Dora Marsden, published a pamphlet entitled Prufrock and Other Observations (London), containing twelve poems by Eliot. \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" was the first in the volume.[1] Also Eliot was appointed assistant editor of the Egoist in June 1917.[9]:290\\r\\nAccording to Eliot biographer Lyndall Gordon, when Eliot was writing the first drafts of Prufrock in his notebook in 1910ÿ1911, he intentionally kept four pages blank in the middle section of the poem.[10] According to the notebooks, now in the collection of the New York Public Library, Eliot finished the poem that was originally published sometime in July and August 1911when he was 22 years old.[11] In 1912, Eliot revised the poem and included a 38-line section now called \\"Prufrock's Pervigilium\\" which was inserted on those blank pages, and intended as a middle section for the poem.[10] However, Eliot removed this section soon after seeking the advice of his fellow Harvard acquaintance and poet Conrad Aiken.[12] This section would not be included in the original publication of Eliot's poem but was included when published posthumously in the 1996 collection of Eliot's early, unpublished drafts in Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909ÿ1917.[11] This Pervigilium section describes the \\"vigil\\" of Prufrock through an evening and night[11]:41, 43ÿ44, 176ÿ90 described by one reviewer as an \\"erotic foray into the narrow streets of a social and emotional underworld\\" that portray \\"in clammy detail Prufrock's tramping 'through certain half-deserted streets' and the context of his 'muttering retreats / Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels.'\\"[13]\\r\\nIts reception in London can be gauged from an unsigned review in The Times Literary Supplement on 21 June 1917. \\"The fact that these things occurred to the mind of Mr. Eliot is surely of the very smallest importance to anyone, even to himself. They certainly have no relation to poetry.\\"[14]\\r\\nThe Harvard Vocarium at Harvard College recorded Eliot's reading of Prufrock and other poems in 1947, as part of their ongoing series of poetry readings by their authors.[15]\\r\\nIn his early drafts, Eliot gave the poem the subtitle \\"Prufrock among the Women.\\"[11]:41 This subtitle was apparently discarded before publication. Eliot called the poem a \\"love song\\" in reference to Rudyard Kipling's poem \\"The Love Song of Har Dyal,\\" first published in Kipling's collection Plain Tales from the Hills (1888).[16] In 1959, Eliot addressed a meeting of the Kipling Society and discussed the influence of Kipling upon his own poetry:\\r\\nTraces of Kipling appear in my own mature verse where no diligent scholarly sleuth has yet observed them, but which I am myself prepared to disclose. I once wrote a poem called \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\": I am convinced that it would never have been called \\"Love Song\\" but for a title of Kipling's that stuck obstinately in my head: \\"The Love Song of Har Dyal\\".[16]\\r\\nHowever, the origin of the name Prufrock is not certain, and Eliot never remarked on its origin other than to claim he was unsure of how he came upon the name. Many scholars and indeed Eliot himself have pointed towards the autobiographical elements in the character of Prufrock, and Eliot at the time of writing the poem was in the habit of rendering his name as \\"T.?Stearns Eliot,\\" very similar in form to that of J. Alfred Prufrock.[17] It is suggested that the name \\"Prufrock\\" came from Eliot's youth in St. Louis, Missouri, where the Prufrock-Litton Company, a large furniture store, occupied one city block downtown at 420ÿ422 North Fourth Street.[18][19][20] In a 1950 letter, Eliot said, \\"I did not have, at the time of writing the poem, and have not yet recovered, any recollection of having acquired this name in any way, but I think that it must be assumed that I did, and that the memory has been obliterated.\\"[21]\\r\\nThe draft version of the poem's epigraph comes from Dante's Purgatorio (XXVI, 147ÿ148):[11]:39, 41\\r\\n'sovegna vos a temps de ma dolor'.\\r\\nPoi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina.\\r\\n'be mindful in due time of my pain'.\\r\\nThen dived he back into that fire which refines them.[22]\\r\\nHe finally decided not to use this, but eventually used the quotation in the closing lines of his 1922 poem The Waste Land. The quotation that Eliot did choose comes from Dante also. Inferno (XXVII, 61ÿ66) reads:\\r\\nS\`io credesse che mia risposta fosse\\r\\nA persona che mai tornasse al mondo,\\r\\nQuesta fiamma staria senza piu scosse.\\r\\nMa perciocch giammai di questo fondo\\r\\nNon torn vivo alcun, s'i'odo il vero,\\r\\nSenza tema d'infamia ti rispondo.\\r\\nIf I but thought that my response were made\\r\\nto one perhaps returning to the world,\\r\\nthis tongue of flame would cease to flicker.\\r\\nBut since, up from these depths, no one has yet\\r\\nreturned alive, if what I hear is true,\\r\\nI answer without fear of being shamed.[23]\\r\\nIn context, the epigraph refers to a meeting between Dante and Guido da Montefeltro, who was condemned to the eighth circle of Hell for providing counsel to Pope Boniface VIII, who wished to use Guido's advice for a nefarious undertaking. This encounter follows Dante's meeting with Ulysses, who himself is also condemned to the circle of the Fraudulent. According to Ron Banerjee, the epigraph serves to cast ironic light on Prufrock's intent. Like Guido, Prufrock had never intended his story to be told, and so by quoting Guido, Eliot reveals his view of Prufrock's love song.[24]\\r\\nFrederick Locke contends that Prufrock himself is suffering from multiple personalities of sorts, and that he embodies both Guido and Dante in the Inferno analogy. One is the storyteller; the other the listener who later reveals the story to the world. He posits, alternatively, that the role of Guido in the analogy is indeed filled by Prufrock, but that the role of Dante is filled by you, the reader, as in \\"Let us go then, you and I,\\" (1). In that, the reader is granted the power to do as he pleases with Prufrock's love song.[25]\\r\\nBecause the poem is concerned primarily with the irregular musings of the narrator, it can be difficult to interpret. Laurence Perrine wrote, \\"[the poem] presents the apparently random thoughts going through a person's head within a certain time interval, in which the transitional links are psychological rather than logical\\".[26] This stylistic choice makes it difficult to determine exactly what is literal and what is symbolic. On the surface, \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" relays the thoughts of a sexually frustrated middle-aged man who wants to say something but is afraid to do so, and ultimately does not.[26][27] The dispute, however, lies in to whom Prufrock is speaking, whether he is actually going anywhere, what he wants to say, and to what the various images refer.\\r\\nThe intended audience is not evident. Some believe that Prufrock is talking to another person[28] or directly to the reader,[29] while others believe Prufrock's monologue is internal. Perrine writes \\"The 'you and I' of the first line are divided parts of Prufrock's own nature\\",[26] while Mutlu Konuk Blasing suggests that the \\"you and I\\" refers to the relationship between the dilemmas of the character and the author.[30] Similarly, critics dispute whether Prufrock is going somewhere during the course of the poem. In the first half of the poem, Prufrock uses various outdoor images (the sky, streets, cheap restaurants and hotels, fog), and talks about how there will be time for various things before \\"the taking of a toast and tea\\", and \\"time to turn back and descend the stair.\\" This has led many to believe that Prufrock is on his way to an afternoon tea, where he is preparing to ask this \\"overwhelming question\\".[26] Others, however, believe that Prufrock is not physically going anywhere, but rather, is playing through it in his mind.[29][30]\\r\\nPerhaps the most significant dispute lies over the \\"overwhelming question\\" that Prufrock is trying to ask. Many believe that Prufrock is trying to tell a woman of his romantic interest in her,[26] pointing to the various images of women's arms and clothing and the final few lines in which Prufrock laments that the mermaids will not sing to him. Others, however, believe that Prufrock is trying to express some deeper philosophical insight or disillusionment with society, but fears rejection, pointing to statements that express a disillusionment with society, such as \\"I have measured out my life with coffee spoons\\" (line 51). Many believe that the poem is a criticism of Edwardian society and Prufrock's dilemma represents the inability to live a meaningful existence in the modern world.[31] McCoy and Harlan wrote \\"For many readers in the 1920s, Prufrock seemed to epitomize the frustration and impotence of the modern individual. He seemed to represent thwarted desires and modern disillusionment.\\"[29]\\r\\nIn general, Eliot uses imagery which is indicative of Prufrock's character,[26] representing ageing and decay. For example, \\"When the evening is spread out against the sky / Like a patient etherized upon a table\\" (lines 2ÿ3), the \\"sawdust restaurants\\" and \\"cheap hotels,\\" the yellow fog, and the afternoon \\"Asleep...tired... or it malingers\\" (line 77), are reminiscent of languor and decay, while Prufrock's various concerns about his hair and teeth, as well as the mermaids \\"Combing the white hair of the waves blown back / When the wind blows the water white and black,\\" show his concern over aging.\\r\\nLike many of Eliot's poems, \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" makes numerous allusions to other works, which are often symbolic themselves.","input":"When was the lovesong of j alfred prufrock published?"},{"output":"Alvaro Hernndez Ortiz","context":"\\"La Bamba\\" (pronounced?[la ?amba]) is a Mexican folk song, originally from the state of Veracruz, best known from a 1958 adaptation by Ritchie Valens, a top 40 hit in the U.S. charts and one of early rock and roll's best-known songs. Valens' version of \\"La Bamba\\" is ranked number 354 on Rolling Stone magazines list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It is the only song on the list sung in a language other than English.\\r\\n\\"La Bamba\\" has been covered by numerous artists, most notably by Los Lobos, whose version was the title track of the 1987 film La Bamba and reached No. 1 in the U.S. and UK singles charts in the same year. The Los Lobos version remained No. 1 for three weeks in the summer of 1987. The music video for Los Lobos' version, directed by Sherman Halsey, won the 1988 MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"La Bamba\\" is a classic example of the son jarocho musical style, which originated in the Mexican state of Veracruz and combines Spanish, indigenous, and African musical elements. The song is typically played on one or two arpas jarochas (harps) along with guitar relatives the jarana jarocha and the requinto jarocho.[1] Lyrics to the song vary greatly, as performers often improvise verses while performing. However, versions such as those by musical groups Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan and Los Pregoneros del Puerto have survived because of the artists' popularity. The traditional aspect of \\"La Bamba\\" lies in the tune, which remains almost the same through most versions. The name of the dance, which has no direct English translation, is presumably connected with the Spanish verb bambolear, meaning \\"to shake\\" or perhaps \\"to stomp\\".\\r\\nA traditional huapango song, \\"La Bamba\\" is often played during weddings in Veracruz, where the bride and groom perform the accompanying dance. Today this wedding tradition is observed less often than in the past, but the dance is still popular, perhaps through the popularity of ballet folkl܇rico. The dance is performed displaying the newly wed couple's unity through the performance of complicated, delicate steps in unison as well as through creation of a bow from a list܇n, a long red ribbon, using only their feet.\\r\\nThe \\"arriba\\" (literally \\"up\\") part of the song suggests the nature of the dance, in which the footwork, called \\"zapateado\\", is done faster and faster as the music tempo accelerates. A repeated lyric is \\"Yo no soy marinero, soy capitn\\", meaning \\"I am not a sailor, I am a captain\\"; Veracruz is a maritime locale.\\r\\nAlthough an obscure and possibly non-existent 1908 Mexican recording has been cited,[2] the earliest certain recording of the song is that by Alvaro Hernndez Ortiz, credited as El Jarocho, which was released on the Victor label in Mexico in about 1939 (Victor 76102). This recording was reissued on a 1997 compilation by Yazoo Records, The Secret Museum Of Mankind Vol. 4.[3]\\r\\nAccording to a 1945 article in Life magazine, the song and associated dance were brought \\"out of the jungle\\" at Veracruz by American bandleader Everett Hoagland, who introduced it at Ciro's nightclub in Mexico City. It became popular, and the song was adopted by Mexican presidential candidate Miguel Alemn Valds who used it in his successful campaign. Later in 1945, the music and dance were introduced at the Stork Club in New York City by Arthur Murray.[4] A popular version by Andrs Huesca (1917ÿ1957) and his brother Victor, billed as Hermanos Huesca, was issued on Peerless Records in Mexico in about 1945ÿ46. Huesca re-recorded the song for RCA Victor in 1947,[2] and the same year the song featured as a production number in the MGM musical film Fiesta, performed by a group called Los Bocheros and with the songwriting credited to Luis Martinez Serrano.[5]\\r\\nThe Swedish-American folk singer William Clauson recorded the song in several languages in the early and mid 1950s. He claimed to have heard the song in Veracruz, and in performance slowed down the tempo to encourage audience participation.[6][7] Another version, \\"somewhat bowdlerized\\", was recorded by Cynthia Gooding on her 1953 Elektra album, Mexican Folk Songs.[8] The song was also recorded for the French market in 1956 by Juanita Linda and her backing group Los Mont-Real.[9] The same year, Harry Belafonte reportedly recorded the song, but a version by Belafonte was not commercially released until a live recording made at Carnegie Hall in 1960.\\r\\nThe traditional song inspired Ritchie Valens' rock and roll version \\"La Bamba\\" in 1958.[10] Valens' \\"La Bamba\\" infused the traditional tune with a rock drive, in part provided by session musicians Earl Palmer and Carol Kaye, making the song popular with a much wider record audience and earning it (and Valens) a place in rock history (he was inducted posthumously into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2001). The musicians on that session were Buddy Clark: string bass, Ernie Freeman: piano, Carol Kaye: acoustic rhythm guitar, Rene Hall: Danelectro guitar (six-string baritone guitar), Earl Palmer: drums, Ritchie Valens: vocals, lead guitar.[11]\\r\\nThe song features a simple verse-chorus form. Valens, who was proud of his Mexican heritage, was hesitant at first to merge \\"La Bamba\\" with rock and roll but then agreed. The song ranked No. 98 in VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Rock and Roll in 1999, and No. 59 in VH1's 100 Greatest Dance Songs in 2000. Furthermore, Valens' recording of the song was inducted into the Latin Grammy Hall of Fame.[12]\\r\\nWhen the Los Lobos cover of Valens' version peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1987, Valens was retroactively credited with writing a No. 1 single.\\r\\nTrini Lopez performed his own version of \\"La Bamba\\" on his album Trini Lopez Live at PJs, released in 1963; this recording of the tune was later reissued as a single in 1966.\\r\\nThe rock group Los Lobos' 1987 cover of Ritchie Valens \\"La Bamba\\" reached number one on Billboards Hot 100 Chart.\\r\\nThe music video for Los Lobos' version of the song was directed by Sherman Halsey and featured Lou Diamond Phillips (who played Valens in the film named after the song). The music video was the winner of the 1988 MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film.\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\\r\\nThe song has been covered by many artists. In 1956 Harry Belafonte recorded the song on an EP and in 1960 the song was included on the album \\"Belafonte returns to Carnegie Hall. In 1963, Glen Campbell recorded the song on his album The Astounding 12-String Guitar of Glen Campbell. In 1979, singer Antonia Rodriguez recorded a disco version which hit number thirty-four on the American disco chart.[31] Los Lonely Boys, a rock trio from Texas, often include the song in their live stage act. They cite Valens as an influence in their music.[32][33]","input":"Who is the original singer of la bamba?"},{"output":"three","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tenth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television programme Doctor Who, who is played by David Tennant in three series as well as nine specials.  As with previous incarnations of the Doctor, the character has also appeared in other Doctor Who spin-offs. In the programme's narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor can regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality change, and a new actor assumes the role. Tennant's portrayal of the Doctor is of an outwardly charismatic and charming adventurer whose likable and easygoing attitude can quickly turn to righteous fury when provoked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis incarnation's companions include working class shop assistant Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), medical student Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), and fiery temp worker Donna Noble (Catherine Tate). He eventually parts ways with them all by the end of the 2008 series finale, \\"Journey's End\\", after which he attempts to travel alone for the duration of the 2008ÿ2010 specials before being accompanied by Donna Noble's grandfather Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins) on his final adventure in The End of Time.\\r\\n\\r\\nExecutive producer Russell T Davies revived Doctor Who after a 16-year absence with the premiere of \\"Rose\\" in 2005. Following the BBC's announcement of a second series being commissioned, the story broke that Christopher Eccleston, who played the titular Ninth Doctor, would not be returning for the second series. On 16 April 2005, the BBC announced that David Tennant had been selected for the role of the Tenth Doctor.[12] His first appearance in the series was for 20 seconds following the Ninth Doctor's regeneration at the end of \\"The Parting of the Ways\\". His first full episode as the Doctor, barring an appearance in a \\"mini-episode\\" during the 2005 Children in Need show, was the 2005 Christmas Special, \\"The Christmas Invasion\\". He then appeared in the 2006, 2007 and 2008 series. Rather than a traditional series run, 2009 and early 2010 featured Tennant in a series of four specials. He also guest-starred in the 2009 two-part The Sarah Jane Adventures story The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith. Tennant also appears in two animated serials; The Infinite Quest is counted with the third series,[citation needed] and Dreamland is counted amongst the 2008ÿ2010 specials.[citation needed] In 2013, Tennant reprised his role as the Doctor for the 50th anniversary special \\"The Day of the Doctor\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tenth Doctor speaks with an Estuary English accent, rather than the Greater Manchester accent (Christopher Eccleston's own accent) that the Ninth Doctor used, the Received Pronunciation of most earlier Doctors, or Tennant's natural Scottish English. David Tennant told SFX magazine in 2006 that Russell T Davies had asked him to drop his natural Scottish accent, because he felt \\"we'd like to not go for another obvious regional accent, because I suppose they'd done that\\".[13]  In a 23 December interview on BBC Radio 1, Tennant explained that a line had been scripted for the Christmas special explaining that the newly regenerated Doctor had imprinted on Rose Tyler's accent, \\"like a chick hatching from an egg\\", but the line was cut from the final episode.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe depictions of the personalities of the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors shared certain similarities[14][15] e.g. both being youthful, energetic, friendly, childlike, \\"good boyfriend Doctors\\", as Steven Moffat described them[16] and, according to Mark Gatiss \\"very human Doctors\\" when compared to other incarnations.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doctor complains that his tenth incarnation is not \\"ginger\\". However, this incarnation was happy to have sideburns and to have more hair than his previous incarnation. He wears his own brown hair in various ways throughout the series: unstyled in \\"The Christmas Invasion\\", a 1950s-style quiff in \\"The Idiot's Lantern\\", and flattened forwards in \\"The Runaway Bride\\" and \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", but mainly styled it in a spiked up fashion throughout most of the series, with this style being described by friend and later one-time companion Wilfred Mott as being a, \\"Modern style sort of hair. All sticky-uppy\\". He has dark brown eyes and is perceived by most, including companions and other characters such as his future incarnation as \\"slim and a little bit foxy\\".[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis costume was unveiled on July 27, 2005.[20] He generally wears either a dark brown (with blue pinstripes) or a blue (with rust red pinstripes) four-buttoned suit, a shirt and a tie, a light brown faux-suede overcoat (which he claims was given to him by Janis Joplin), and different coloured pairs of Converse All-Star sneakers, depending on his suit. According to an interview on Parkinson, David Tennant and Russell T Davies got the idea for the Tenth Doctor's costume from an outfit Jamie Oliver had worn on Parkinson just after Tennant had taken the role.[21] David Tennant has commented that he would vary the combination of the buttons he fastened on his jacket in different episodes. Tennant thought the look was very geek chic.[20][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doctor dons a pair of dark tortoise-shell rectangular frame glasses, an affectation (along with his signature footwear) borrowed from the Fifth Doctor. He also occasionally sports a pair of Red-Cyan 3D glasses, both as a joke and for practical reasons. The Tenth Doctor's costume became so popular that it has spawned numerous recreations (including a BBC-licensed replica of the Tenth Doctor's overcoat by AbbyShot Clothiers[23] and a white/red version worn by Tennant when he co-hosted Comic Relief), and has been cited by costume designer Louise Page as the costume she is most proud of from her time on Doctor Who.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) regenerates into the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) at the climax of the 2005 series finale, \\"The Parting of the Ways\\"; he re-introduces himself to his companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) in an  Children in Need mini-episode known as \\"Born Again\\". In the Christmas special, he is in a comatose state for most of the episode, following his regeneration. After eventually waking up, he defeats the alien Sycorax and saves Earth; in the process, he loses a hand, which regrows owing to his recent regeneration. Amongst other 2006 series adventures, the Doctor and Rose save Queen Victoria (Pauline Collins) from a werewolf, resulting in the creation of the anti-alien Torchwood Institute. The Doctor shares an adventure with two former companions, journalist Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) and robot dog K-9 (John Leeson), before taking on Rose's boyfriend Mickey (Noel Clarke) as a second companion. The TARDIS slips through a crack in the Time Vortex causing them to be stranded on a parallel Earth, where they encounter the Cybermen. After saving parallel Earth, Mickey decides to stay and help stop the Cybermen around the world despite the Doctor telling him he can never return. He and Rose become stranded on a planet orbiting around a black hole where The Beast is waiting, with a Torchwood team. While there The Beast taunts the Doctor and Rose about Rose's death. During the 2012 Olympic Games, the Doctor picks up the Olympic flame and carries it to the end, starting the Games. The series finale takes place in contemporary London, where modern-day Torchwood is the scene for war between the evil alien Daleks and parallel-universe cyborgs the Cybermen; saving the Earth costs the Doctor Rose, who is stranded in a parallel universe, along with Mickey and her mother, in \\"Doomsday\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the closing scene of \\"Doomsday\\", a mysterious bride (Catherine Tate) inexplicably appears in his TARDIS. The 2006 Christmas special sees the Doctor and bride-to-be Donna Noble save the Earth; Donna saves the Doctor from going too far in his revenge against the alien Racnoss and declines his offer of companionship. In the 2007 series, the Doctor takes on Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman) as his new companion. Together, they witness the mysterious Face of Boe (Struan Rodger) prophecy to the Doctor that \\"you are not alone.\\" They are rejoined by former companion Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) in a three-episode adventure where presumed-deceased archenemy and fellow Time Lord the Master (John Simm) becomes Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and enslaves the Doctor for one year. Martha's plan sees the Doctor infused with the world's psychic energies, and he easily defeats the Master, who seemingly refuses to regenerate and dies in the Doctor's arms. Following this adventure, in the dnouement of series finale \\"Last of the Time Lords\\", Jack and Martha both depart the TARDIS, and the Doctor is shocked to see what appears to be the RMS Titanic crash into it. Set moments prior, another Children in Need mini-episode, \\"Time Crash\\", features a brief encounter between Tennant's Tenth Doctor and the Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison), containing meta-humour surrounding the fact David Tennant had watched and loved Davison's doctor as a child. In parallel with the third series, Tennant lends his voice to the animated serial The Infinite Quest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2007 Christmas special sees the Doctor and a waitress, Astrid (Kylie Minogue), save the Earth from the impending crash of the starship Titanic; Astrid dies heroically, and the Doctor encounters Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins) for the first time. In the 2008 series premire episode, the Doctor is reunited with Donna Noble, Mott's granddaughter, who becomes his regular companion. In \\"Planet of the Ood\\", the alien Ood prophesy the Tenth Doctor's demise. Martha accompanies them for three episodes; in two, the Doctor battles the alien Sontarans, and last of which sees him become a father of sorts to Jenny (Georgia Moffett), in \\"The Doctor's Daughter\\". He meets archaeologist and future companion River Song (Alex Kingston) for the first time from his perspective in the two-parter \\"Silence in the Library\\"/\\"Forest of the Dead\\"; she dies, but he stores her consciousness to a hard drive to live on forever, after accepting that one day she will come to mean a lot to him. After Donna encounters Rose in a parallel world in \\"Turn Left\\", the Doctor realises that Rose's words to Donna  \\"Bad Wolf\\"  must herald the end of the world. In finale episodes \\"The Stolen Earth\\" and \\"Journey's End\\" (which cross over with spin-offs Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures), the Doctor and Donna reunite with former companions Rose, Sarah Jane, Martha, Jack, and Mickey to save the universe from Davros (Julian Bleach), the creator of the Daleks. The Doctor was fatally wounded during the event, aborting in mid-regeneration to maintain his current self while transferring the residual energies in his previously severed hand. This resulted in a metacrisis that created a half-human Doctor who would live with Rose in the parallel universe while imbuing Donna with a Timelord's mind, forcing the Doctor to erase his companion's memories to save her life and leaving her with her family. A Doctor Who Prom mini-episode, \\"Music of the Spheres\\", features a lone Doctor composing his musical Ode to the Universe before being interrupted by the small alien Graske (Jimmy Vee).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn lieu of a 2009 series, Tennant appears as the Tenth Doctor, without a regular companion, in several special episodes over the course of 2008 and 2009, the last of which aired on New Year's Day, 2010.  In the Christmas special \\"The Next Doctor\\", the Doctor mistakenly believes he has met a later incarnation of himself in an amnesiac Londoner (David Morrissey), with whom he saves Victorian-era London. \\"Planet of the Dead\\" (Easter 2009) features jewel thief Lady Christina de Souza (Michelle Ryan) as the Doctor's one-off companion, and the Doctor is presented with a prophecy of his imminent death. Tennant makes a crossover appearance in a The Sarah Jane Adventures two-parter, The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith, in which a powerful being known as the Trickster (Paul Marc Davis) also alludes to the Tenth Doctor's impending demise. In \\"The Waters of Mars\\", the Doctor tries to alter history and avert the death of one-off companion Adelaide Brooke (Lindsay Duncan); when she commits suicide, he begins to feel his mortality weigh down upon him. In the animated serial Dreamland, the Doctor is joined by two one-off companions in 1950s Roswell, New Mexico. In the two-part send-off The End of Time, the Doctor confronts the Ood about their original prophecy and is led to contemporary Earth where, in the second part, the again-resurrected Master (Simm) restores Gallifrey and the Time Lords to existence, although he redeems himself by assisting the Doctor to defeat Time Lord President Rassilon (Timothy Dalton) before disappearing alongside the other Time Lords. The Doctor sacrifices his life to save Mott, exposing himself to 500,000 rads of deadly radiation and triggering his regeneration. He holds it back and is shown visiting several companions.[a] He gives Donna a winning lottery ticket on her wedding day, buying it with money he borrowed from her late father in the past, saves Martha and Mickey from a Sontaran sniper, saves Sarah Jane's son Luke (Tommy Knight) from a car, introduces Jack to a romantic interest (Russell Tovey), and finally, just before regenerating into the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith), he informs Rose in 2005 that she is about to have a \\"great year\\". As he begins regenerating once in the TARDIS, his last words are \\"I don't want to go\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nTennant reprised the role for the show's 50th anniversary in \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" (2013), appearing alongside the Eleventh Doctor (Smith) and a forgotten past incarnation, the War Doctor, played by John Hurt. In the special, in which we view scenes from the Tenth Doctor's time taking place between \\"The Waters of Mars\\" and The End of Time, the Doctor unintentionally marries Queen Elizabeth I (Joanna Page) while luring out a Zygon. He helps the other Doctors in saving Gallifrey at the Time War's conclusion, but will not retain memories of the event.  His final words are, once again \\"I don't want to go\\" after being told that he will die on Trenzalore.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Tennant has also made numerous cameo appearances as the Doctor outside of Doctor Who, frequently in spoof appearances. Singer and actress Charlotte Church spoofs Doctor Who alongside an actor playing the Tenth Doctor in her own The Charlotte Church Show (2006). In an appearance on The Friday Night Project in 2007, Tennant plays a female companion to the Tenth Doctor (Justin Lee Collins) on the Pink Planet, where they are confronted by the alien Gay Lord (Alan Carr). When the show became The Sunday Night Project, Catherine Tate appeared in a skit playing the Tenth Doctor. Tennant starred opposite Catherine Tate in her own The Catherine Tate Show special (2007) as Lauren Cooper's (Tate) teacher Mr. Logan, who Cooper teases for his resemblance to the Doctor; eventually, he reveals himself to be the Tenth Doctor and shrinks Cooper into a 5\\" Rose Tyler action figure. In the final episode of Extras (December 2007), a brief scene shows the Doctor and an unidentified Wren companion attacked by Schlong, a slug-like alien played by Andy Millman (Ricky Gervais). The Tenth Doctor is also featured in political satire; in a 2007 episode of Dead Ringers, when faced by the question of Gordon Brown's succession, Tony Blair (impressionist Jon Culshaw) regenerates into David Tennant after promising \\"New Labour is all about renewal\\", later vowing 100 more years of power. Tennant modifies his first line in \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" (\\"New teeth, that's weird\\"), to \\"New Labour, that's weird\\" and proceeds to address the public in a Tony Blair impression resembling Culshaw's. Tennant also guest voiced his incarnation of the Doctor in an episode of Family Guy (2016). He later played the role in full-costume for a sketch with The Muppets in a live performance at The O2 Arena in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the face of the Doctor Who franchise for 2005ÿ10, the Tenth Doctor appears extensively in Doctor Who spin-off media; in the majority of these series, the character simply takes after the place of the Ninth Doctor, and in turn is replaced by the Eleventh following the debut of the 2010 series. Novels featuring the Tenth Doctor are all published by BBC Books. The character appears in New Series Adventures novels spanning from The Stone Rose (April 2006) to The Krillitane Storm (September 2009). A number  Decide Your Destiny novels were published between July 2007 and March 2008, as well as five books published as a part of Quick Reads Initiative, a government-sponsored adult literacy project. BBC Children's Books released their own 10-part series, The Darksmith Legacy, supported by an interactive tie-in website. Additionally, short stories are frequently published in Doctor Who Magazine, The Doctor Who Storybook series (2007ÿ10 editions), the BBC website, and annuals and suchlike; one example being the story \\"The Lodger\\" by Gareth Roberts, later adapted into an Eleventh Doctor television episode of the same name. National newspapers The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Times have each published one Christmas-themed Tenth Doctor short story. Additionally, the Tenth Doctor appears in a novelisation of his The Sarah Jane Adventures crossover appearance. The Tenth Doctor also appears extensively in comic books, replacing the Ninth Doctor in those published in Doctor Who Magazine,  and the younger-audience Doctor Who Adventures and Doctor Who: Battles in Time. American comic book publisher initially published a 2008 Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones miniseries between January and June 2006. This was later followed by a truly ongoing Tenth Doctor series in July 2009, set during the 2008ÿ2010 specials and lasting sixteen issues before relaunching with the Eleventh Doctor. In stories set after \\"Journey's End\\", the Doctor is accompanied by numerous one-off and recurring companions who do not feature in the television series.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside of Doctor Who literature, penciller Georges Jeanty includes a cameo of the Tenth Doctor and Rose in a panel of Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight story arc \\"No Future for You\\". The Tenth Doctor was utilised in the American satirical political cartoon strip, This Modern World. Arriving in 2003, the Doctor hints to Sparky the Wonder Penguin (the strip's main character) that in five years' time, the next President could be a black man, with the middle name Hussein, whose father was a Muslim, referring to the popularity of Senator Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential election.[25] The character also appeared in a story arc of the webcomic PvP, in which character Brent Sienna hallucinates materialising in the TARDIS.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is the case with the BBC Books novels, the Tenth Doctor replaced the Ninth as the face of the Doctor Who audiobook series, beginning with Pest Control in May 2008 and ending with Dead Air in March 2010. The majority are read by David Tennant, save one read by Michelle Ryan and two by Catherine Tate. A number of Tenth Doctor novels were also abridged to become audiobooks, again featuring David Tennant's voice alongside other cast members such as Freema Agyeman and television series guest stars such as Georgia Moffett, Reggie Yates and Anthony Head; the last of these scheduled is Judgement of the Judoon, for December 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 26 October 2015, it was announced Tennant would reprise his role for The Tenth Doctor Adventures, a series of full-cast audio stories produced by Big Finish Productions. The first volume of stories had the reprise of Catherine Tate as Donna Noble, consisting of Technophobia, Time Reaver, and Death and the Queen, which were released in May 2016.[27] The second volume of stories saw Billie Piper reprise her role as Rose Tyler alongside Tennant, the stories consisted of Infamy of the Zaross (with Camille Coduri as Jackie Tyler), Sword of the Chevalier, and Cold Vengeance, which were released in November 2017.[28] A third volume has been announced for release in May 2019, once again with Catherine Tate as Donna Noble, in the stories No Place (with as Jacqueline King as Sylvia Noble and Bernard Cribbins as Wilfred Mott), One Mile Down and The Creeping Death.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nA series of audiobooks featuring the Tenth Doctor was also produced by Big Finish, The Tenth Doctor Chronicles.

They perform many official government duties, and execute minor judicial powers as part of Barangay Justice System, such as settling disputes between neighbours.

During the Spanish era, the office was known by the title Cabeza de Barangay (literally, \\"head of the barangay\\"), and was an unelected post.\\r\\nAt the beginning of the American Colonial Period, the office was renamed Barrio Lieutenant. Under the Administrative Code of 1917, passed by the Philippine Assembly, these too were not elected but rather were appointed by and under the supervision of the city councillor for the barrio.[3] Councillors were elected at that time by electoral districts. Barrio lieutenants received no pay or other compensation.[3] The lieutenant was to assist the city councillor and his term ended when the councillor's term ended.[3]\\r\\nDuring the American Occupation and after independence in 1946, barangays were known as barrios and barangay leaders were known as Barrio Lieutenants.\\r\\nIn 1991, the position took its present name and form with amendments to the Local Government Code.\\r\\nHere is table showing the number of provinces, municipalities, cities, and barangays in Philippines.","input":"How long is the term of barangay captain?"},{"output":"8ÿ16 November 1942","context":"Coordinates: 350506N 20144W? / ?35.085N 2.029W? / 35.085; -2.029\\r\\n\\r\\n?United States\\r\\n?United Kingdom\\r\\n\\r\\n?Free France\\r\\n\\r\\n?Canada\\r\\n?Netherlands\\r\\n\\r\\n Vichy France\\r\\n\\r\\n Fran?ois Darlan Charles Nogus Frix Michelier\\r\\n\\r\\nOperation Torch (8ÿ16 November 1942, formerly Operation Gymnast) was a AngloÿAmerican invasion of French North Africa, during the North African Campaign of the Second World War. Torch was the debut of the mass involvement of US troops in the EuropeanÿNorth African Theatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Soviet Union had long pressed the US and British to start operations in Europe and open a second front, to reduce the pressure of German forces on the Red Army. While  US commanders favored Operation Sledgehammer, a landing in Occupied Europe as soon as possible, British commanders believed that it was premature and likely to end in disaster and proposed landings in French North Africa. On July 28, the Axis Afrika Korps, under General Erwin Rommel, captured Mersa Matruh, in Egypt, only 140 miles (230?km) from Alexandria.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandings in north-west Africa would reduce pressure on Allied forces in Egypt, secure Allied naval control of the south-west Mediterranean and enable an invasion of Southern Europe in 1943. The U.S. President, Roosevelt, suspected that such landings would rule out an invasion of western Europe in 1943 but agreed to support the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.\\r\\n\\r\\nSenior US commanders remained strongly opposed to the landings and after the western Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) met in Washington on July 30, General George Marshall and Admiral Ernest King declined to approve the plan. Roosevelt gave a direct order that Torch was to have precedence over other operations and was to take place at the earliest possible date, one of only two direct orders he gave to military commanders during the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Allies planned an Anglo-American invasion of north-western Africa/MaghrebMorocco, Algeria and Tunisia, territory nominally in the hands of the Vichy French government. With British forces advancing from Egypt, this would eventually allow the Allies to carry out a pincer operation against Axis forces in North Africa. The Vichy French had around 125,000 soldiers in the territories as well as coastal artillery, 210 operational but out-of-date tanks and about 500 aircraft, half of which were Dewoitine D.520 fightersequal to many British and U.S. fighters.[4] These forces included 60,000 troops in Morocco, 15,000 in Tunisia, and 50,000 in Algeria, with coastal artillery, and a small number of tanks and aircraft.[5] In addition, there were 10 or so warships and 11 submarines at Casablanca.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Allies believed that the Vichy French forces would not fight, partly because of information supplied by American Consul Robert Daniel Murphy in Algiers. The French were former Allies of the U.S. and the American troops were instructed not to fire unless they were fired upon.[6]\\r\\nHowever, they harbored suspicions that the Vichy French navy would bear a grudge over the British attack on Mers-el-Kebir in 1940. An assessment of the sympathies of the French forces in North Africa was essential, and plans were made to secure their cooperation, rather than resistance. German support for the Vichy French came in the shape of air support. Several Luftwaffe bomber wings undertook anti-shipping strikes against Allied ports in Algiers and along the North African coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Dwight D. Eisenhower was given command of the operation, and he set up his headquarters in Gibraltar. The Allied Naval Commander of the Expeditionary Force would be Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham; his deputy was Vice-Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, who would plan the amphibious landings.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlanners identified Oran and also Algiers and Casablanca as key targets. Ideally there would also be a landing at Tunis to secure Tunisia and facilitate the rapid interdiction of supplies travelling via Tripoli to Rommel's forces in Libya. However, Tunis was much too close to the Axis airfields in Sicily and Sardinia for any hope of success. A compromise would be to land at B?ne (Annaba) in eastern Algeria, some 300 miles (480?km) closer to Tunis than Algiers. Limited resources dictated that the Allies could only make three landings and Eisenhowerwho believed that any plan must include landings at Oran and Algiershad two main options: either the western option, to land at Casablanca, Oran and Algiers and then make as rapid a move as possible to Tunis some 500 miles (800?km) east of Algiers once the Vichy opposition was suppressed; or the eastern option, to land at Oran, Algiers and B?ne and then advance overland to Casablanca some 500 miles (800?km) west of Oran. He favoured the eastern option because of the advantages it gave to an early capture of Tunis and also because the Atlantic swells off Casablanca presented considerably greater risks to an amphibious landing there than would be encountered in the Mediterranean.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Combined Chiefs of Staff, however, were concerned that should Operation Torch precipitate Spain to abandon neutrality and join the Axis, the Straits of Gibraltar could be closed cutting the entire Allied force's lines of communication. They therefore chose the Casablanca option as the less risky since the forces in Algeria and Tunisia could be supplied overland from Casablanca (albeit with considerable difficulty) in the event of closure of the straits.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarshalls opposition to Torch delayed the landings by almost a month, and his opposition to landings in Algeria led British military leaders to question his strategic ability; the Royal Navy controlled the Strait of Gibraltar, and Spain was unlikely to intervene as Franco was hedging his bets. The Morocco landings ruled out the early occupation of Tunisia. Eisenhower told Patton that the past six weeks were the most trying of his life.[8] In Eisenhower's acceptance of landings in Algeria and Morocco he pointed out that the decision removed the early capture of Tunis from the probable to only the remotely possible because of the extra time it would afford the Axis to move forces into Tunisia.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 1941, Mieczys?aw S?owikowski (using the codename \\"Rygor\\"Polish for \\"Rigor\\") set up \\"Agency Africa\\", one of the Second World War's most successful intelligence organizations.[10] His Polish allies in these endeavors included Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ci??ki. The information gathered by the Agency was used by the Americans and British in planning the amphibious November 1942 Operation Torch[11][12] landings in North Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo gauge the feeling of the Vichy French forces, Murphy was appointed to the American consulate in Algeria. His covert mission was to determine the mood of the French forces and to make contact with elements that might support an Allied invasion. He succeeded in contacting several French officers, including General Charles Mast, the French commander-in-chief in Algiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese officers were willing to support the Allies but asked for a clandestine conference with a senior Allied General in Algeria. Major General Mark W. Clarkone of Eisenhower's senior commanderswas dispatched to Cherchell in Algeria aboard the British submarine HMS?Seraph and met with these Vichy French officers on 21 October 1942.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith help from the Resistance, the Allies also succeeded in slipping French General Henri Giraud out of Vichy France on HMS Seraphpassing itself off as an American submarineintending to offer him the post of commander in chief of French forces in North Africa after the invasion. However, Giraud would take no position lower than commander in chief of all the invading forces, a job already given to Eisenhower. When he was refused, he decided to remain \\"a spectator in this affair\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Allies organised three amphibious task forces to simultaneously seize the key ports and airports in Morocco and Algeria, targeting Casablanca, Oran and Algiers. Successful completion of these operations was to be followed by an eastwards advance into Tunisia.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Western Task Force (aimed at Casablanca) was composed of American units, with Major General George S. Patton in command and Rear Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt heading the naval operations. This Western Task Force consisted of the U.S. 2nd Armored Division and the U.S. 3rd and 9th Infantry Divisions35,000?troops in a convoy of over 100?ships. They were transported directly from the United States in the first of a new series of UG convoys providing logistic support for the North African campaign.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Center Task Force, aimed at Oran, included the U.S. 2nd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, and the U.S. 1st Armored Divisiona total of 18,500?troops. They sailed from the United Kingdom and were commanded by Major General Lloyd Fredendall, the naval forces being commanded by Commodore Thomas Troubridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nTorch was, for propaganda purposes, a landing by U.S. forces, supported by British warships and aircraft, under the belief that this would be more palatable to French public opinion, than an Anglo-American invasion. For the same reason, Churchill suggested that British soldiers might wear U.S. Army uniforms, although there is no evidence that this tactic was implemented.[14] (Fleet Air Arm aircraft did carry US \\"star\\" roundels during the operation,[15] and two British destroyers flew the Stars and Stripes.[14]) In reality, the Eastern Task Forceaimed at Algierswas commanded by Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson and consisted of a brigade from the British 78th and the U.S. 34th Infantry Divisions, along with two British commando units (No.?1 and No.?6 Commandos), totaling 20,000?troops. During the landing phase, ground forces were to be commanded by U.S. Major General Charles W. Ryder, Commanding General (CG) of the 34th Division and naval forces were commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir Harold Burrough.\\r\\n\\r\\nU-boats, operating in the eastern Atlantic area crossed by the invasion convoys, had been drawn away to attack trade convoy SL 125. Some historians have suggested the timing of this trade convoy was an intentional tactical diversion to prevent submarine attacks on the troop transports.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAerial operations were split into two, east of Cape Tenez in Algeria, with British aircraft under Air Marshal Sir William Welsh and west of Cape Tenez, all American aircraft under Major General Jimmy Doolittle, under the direct command of Major General Patton.\\r\\n\\r\\nP-40s of the 33rd Fighter Group were launched from U.S. Navy escort carriers and landed at Port Lyautey on November 10. Additional air support was provided by the carrier USS?Ranger, whose squadrons intercepted Vichy aircraft and bombed hostile ships.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Western Task Force landed before daybreak on 8 November 1942, at three points in Morocco: Safi (Operation Blackstone), Fedala (Operation Brushwood, the largest landing with 19,000?men), and Mehdiya-Port Lyautey (Operation Goalpost). Because it was hoped that the French would not resist, there were no preliminary bombardments. This proved to be a costly error as French defenses took a toll of American landing forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the night of 7 November, pro-Allied General Antoine Bthouart attempted a coup d'etat against the French command in Morocco, so that he could surrender to the Allies the next day. His forces surrounded the villa of General Charles Nogus, the Vichy-loyal high commissioner. However, Nogus telephoned loyal forces, who stopped the coup. In addition, the coup attempt alerted Nogus to the impending Allied invasion, and he immediately bolstered French coastal defenses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Safi, the objective being capturing the port facilities to land the Western Task Force's medium tanks, the landings were mostly successful.[17] The landings were begun without covering fire, in the hope that the French would not resist at all. However, once French coastal batteries opened fire, Allied warships returned fire. By the time General Ernest Harmon's 2nd Armored Division arrived, French snipers had pinned the assault troops (most of whom were in combat for the first time) on Safi's beaches. Most of the landings occurred behind schedule. Carrier aircraft destroyed a French truck convoy bringing reinforcements to the beach defenses. Safi surrendered on the afternoon of 8 November. By 10 November, the remaining defenders were pinned down, and the bulk of Harmon's forces raced to join the siege of Casablanca.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Port-Lyautey, the landing troops were uncertain of their position, and the second wave was delayed. This gave the French defenders time to organize resistance, and the remaining landings were conducted under artillery bombardment. With the assistance of air support from the carriers, the troops pushed ahead, and the objectives were captured.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Fedala, weather disrupted the landings. The landing beaches again came under French fire after daybreak. Patton landed at 08:00, and the beachheads were secured later in the day. The Americans surrounded the port of Casablanca by 10 November, and the city surrendered an hour before the final assault was due to take place.\\r\\n\\r\\nCasablanca was the principal French Atlantic naval base after German occupation of the European coast. The Naval Battle of Casablanca resulted from a sortie of French cruisers, destroyers, and submarines opposing the landings. A cruiser, six destroyers, and six submarines were destroyed by American gunfire and aircraft. The incomplete French battleship Jean Bartwhich was docked and immobilefired on the landing force with her one working gun turret until disabled by the 16-inch calibre American naval gunfire of the USS Massachusetts, the first such heavy-calibre shells fired by the U.S. Navy anywhere in World War II. Two U.S. destroyers were damaged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Center Task Force was split between three beaches, two west of Oran and one east. Landings at the westernmost beach were delayed because of a French convoy which appeared while the minesweepers were clearing a path. Some delay and confusion, and damage to landing ships, was caused by the unexpected shallowness of water and sandbars; although periscope observations had been carried out, no reconnaissance parties had landed on the beaches to determine the local maritime conditions. This was in contrast to later amphibious assaultssuch as Operation Overlordin which considerable weight was given to pre-invasion reconnaissance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. 1st Ranger Battalion landed east of Oran and quickly captured the shore battery at Arzew. An attempt was made to land U.S. infantry at the harbour directly, in order to quickly prevent destruction of the port facilities and scuttling of ships. The operationcode named Operation Reservistfailed, as the two Banff-class sloops were destroyed by crossfire from the French vessels there. The Vichy French naval fleet broke from the harbor and attacked the Allied invasion fleet, but its ships were all sunk or driven ashore.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench batteries and the invasion fleet exchanged fire throughout 8ÿ9 November, with French troops defending Oran and the surrounding area stubbornly. Heavy fire from the British battleships brought about Oran's surrender on 9 November.\\r\\n\\r\\nTorch was the first major airborne assault carried out by the United States. The 2nd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment flew all the way from Britain, over Spain, intending to drop near Oran and capture airfields at Tafraoui and La Snia, respectively 15 miles (24?km) and 5 miles (8?km) south of Oran.[19] The operation was marked by weather, navigational and communication problems. Poor weather over Spain and the extreme range caused the formation to scatter and forced thirty of the 37 aircraft to land in the dry salt lake to the west of the objective.[20] Nevertheless, both airports were captured.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs agreed at Cherchell, in the early hours of 8 November, 400 mainly Jewish French Resistance fighters[21] staged a coup in the city of Algiers. Starting at midnight, the force under the command of Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie and Jos Aboulker seized key targets, including the telephone exchange, radio station, governor's house and the headquarters of 19th Corps.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Murphy took some men and then drove to the residence of General Alphonse Juin, the senior French Army officer in North Africa. While they surrounded his house (making Juin effectively a prisoner) Murphy attempted to persuade him to side with the Allies. However, he was treated to a surprise: Admiral Fran?ois Darlanthe commander of all French forceswas also in Algiers on a private visit. Juin insisted on contacting Darlan, and Murphy was unable to persuade either to side with the Allies. In the early morning, the local Gendarmerie arrived and released both Juin and Darlan.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 November 1942, the invasion commenced with landings split between three beachestwo west of Algiers and one east. Under overall command of Major General Charles W. Ryder, Commanding General of the U.S. 34th Infantry Division, British 11th Brigade Group from the British 78th Infantry Division, landed on the right hand beach, U.S. 168th Regimental Combat Team, from the 34th Infantry Division, supported by 6th Commando and most of 1st Commando on the middle beach while the U.S. 39th Regimental Combat Team, also from the U.S. 34th Division, supported by the remaining 5 troops from 1st Commando landed on the left hand beach. The British 36th Brigade Group from the British 78th Division stood by in floating reserve.[22] Though some landings went to the wrong beaches, this was immaterial because of the extremely low level of French opposition. All the coastal batteries had been neutralized by French resistance, and one French commander openly welcomed the landing Allies. The only fighting took place in the port of Algiers, where in Operation Terminal, two British destroyers attempted to land a party of U.S. Army Rangers directly onto the dock, in order to prevent the French destroying the port facilities and scuttling their ships. Heavy artillery fire prevented one destroyer from landing, but the other was able to disembark 250 Rangers before it too was driven back to sea.[18] The landed troops pushed quickly inland and General Juin surrendered the city to the Allies at 18:00.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt quickly became clear that Giraud lacked the authority to take command of the French forces. He preferred to wait in Gibraltar for the results of the landing. However, Darlan in Algiers had such authority. Eisenhower, with the support of Roosevelt and Churchill, made an agreement with Darlan, recognizing him as French \\"High Commissioner\\" in North Africa. In return, Darlan ordered all French forces in North Africa to cease resistance to the Allies and to cooperate instead. The deal was made on 10 November, and French resistance ceased almost at once. The French troops in North Africa who were not already captured submitted to and eventually joined the Allied forces.[23] Men from French North Africa would see much combat under the Allied banner as part of the French Expeditionary Corps (consisting of 112,000 troops in April 1944) in the Italian campaign, where Maghrebis (mostly Moroccans) made up over 60% of the unit's soldiers.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Adolf Hitler learned of Darlan's deal with the Allies, he immediately ordered the occupation of Vichy France and sent troops to Tunisia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eisenhower/Darlan agreement meant that the officials appointed by the Vichy regime would remain in power in North Africa. No role was provided for Free France, which was supposed to be France's government-in-exile, and which had taken charge in other French colonies. This deeply offended Charles de Gaulle as head of Free France. It also offended much of the British and American public, who regarded all Vichy French as Nazi collaborators, and Darlan as one of the worst. Eisenhower insisted however that he had no real choice if his forces were to move on against the Axis in Tunisia, rather than fight the French in Algeria and Morocco.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough de Gaulle had no official power in North Africa, much of the population now publicly declared Free French allegiance, putting pressure on Darlan. Then on 24 December, Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle, a French resistance fighter and anti-fascist monarchist, assassinated Darlan. (Bonnier de La Chapelle was arrested on the spot and executed two days later.)\\r\\n\\r\\nGiraud succeeded Darlan but like him replaced few of the Vichy officials. He even ordered the arrest of the leaders of the Algiers coup of 8 November, with no opposition from Murphy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French North African government gradually became active in the Allied war-effort. The weak French troops in Tunisia did not resist German troops arriving by air; Admiral Esteva, the commander there, obeyed orders to that effect from Vichy. The Germans took the airfields there and brought in more troops. The French troops withdrew to the west, and within a few days began to skirmish against the Germans, encouraged by small American and British detachments who had reached the area. While this was of minimal military effect, it committed the French to the Allied side. Later all French forces were withdrawn from action to be properly re-equipped by the Allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiraud supported this but also preferred to maintain the old Vichy administration in North Africa. Under pressure from the Allies and from de Gaulle's supporters, the French rgime shifted, with Vichy officials gradually replaced, and its more offensive decrees rescinded. In June 1943 Giraud and de Gaulle agreed to form the \\"Comit fran?ais de Libration nationale\\" (CFLN), with members from both the North African government and from de Gaulle's \\"French National Committee\\". In November 1943 de Gaulle became head of the CFLN, and de jure head of government of France, recognized by the U.S. and Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another political outcome of Torch (and at Darlan's orders), the previously Vichyite government of French West Africa joined the Allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the terms of the Second Armistice at Compigne agreed to by the Germans was that southern France would remain free of German occupation and self-governed from Vichy. The lack of determined resistance by the Vichy French to the Allied invasions of North Africa and the new de Gaulle policies in North Africa convinced the Germans that France could not be trusted. Moreover, the Anglo-American presence in French North Africa invalidated the only real rationale for not occupying the whole of Metropolitan Franceit was the only practical means to deny the Allies use of the French colonies. The Germans immediately occupied southern France and German troops moved to seize the French fleet in the port of Toulon, beginning on 10 November. The naval strength of the Axis in the Mediterranean would have been greatly increased if the Germans had succeeded in seizing the French ships, but every important ship was scuttled at dock by the French Navy before the Germans could take them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the German and Italian occupation of Vichy France and their unsuccessful attempt to capture the interned French fleet at Toulon (Operation Lila), the French Arme dAfrique sided with the Allies, providing a third corps (XIX Corps) for Anderson. Elsewhere, French warshipssuch as the battleship Richelieurejoined the Allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 9 November, Axis forces started to build up in Tunisia unopposed by the local French forces under General Barr. Wracked with indecision, Barr moved his troops into the hills and formed a defensive line from Teboursouk through Medjez el Bab and ordered that anyone trying to pass through the line would be shot. On 19 November, the German commanderWalter Nehringdemanded passage for his troops across the bridge at Medjez and was refused. The Germans attacked the poorly equipped French units twice and were driven back. However, the French had taken heavy casualties and, lacking artillery and armor, Barr was forced to withdraw.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter consolidating in Algeria, the Allies struck into Tunisia. Elements of the British First Army under Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson came to within 40 miles (64?km) of Tunis before a counterattack at Djedeida thrust them back. In January 1943, German and Italian troops under Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommelretreating westward from Libyareached Tunisia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British Eighth Army in the eastcommanded by Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomerystopped around Tripoli to allow reinforcements to arrive and build up the Allied advantage and to repair the port there. In the west, the forces of the First Army came under attack at the end of January, being forced back from the Fa?d Pass and then suffering a reversal at Sidi Bou Zid on 14ÿ15 February. Axis forces pushed on to Sbeitla and then to the Kasserine Pass on 19 February, where the U.S. II Corps retreated in disarray until heavy Allied reinforcements halted the Axis advance on 22 February. Fredendall was replaced by George Patton.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Sir Harold Alexander arrived in Tunisia in late February to take charge of the new 18th Army Group headquarters, which had been created to take overall control of both the Eighth Army and the Allied forces already fighting in Tunisia. The Axis forces again attacked eastward at Medenine on 6 March but were easily repulsed by the Eighth Army. Rommel counselled Hitler to allow a full retreat to a defensible line but was denied, and on 9 March Rommel left Tunisia to be replaced by Jrgen von Arnim, who had to spread his forces over 100 miles (160?km) of northern Tunisia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe setbacks at Kasserine forced the Allies to consolidate their forces and develop their lines of communication and administration so that they could support a major attack. The First and Eighth Armies then attacked the Axis in April. Hard fighting followed, but the Allies cut off the Germans and Italians from support by naval and air forces between Tunisia and Sicily. On 6 May, as the culmination of Operation Vulcan, the British took Tunis, and American forces reached Bizerte. By 13 May, the Axis forces in Tunisia had surrendered. This opened the way for the Allied invasion of Sicily in July.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite Operation Torch's role in the war and logistical success, it has been largely overlooked in many popular histories of the war and in general cultural influence.[26] The Economist speculated that this is because French forces were the initial enemies of the landing, making for a difficult fit into the war's overall narrative in general histories.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe operation was Americas first armed deployment in the Arab world since the Barbary wars and, according to The Economist, laid the foundations for Americas post-war Middle East policy.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther reading","input":"When did the us invaded africa in ww2?"},{"output":"in 2012","context":"The Miami Marlins are a Major League Baseball team that currently plays in the city of Miami.

Huizenga stated his intention to aggressively pursue an expansion franchise. MLB had announced a few months earlier that it intended to add two new teams to the National League. It was a foregone conclusion that one of them would be placed in Florida; the only question was whether Huizenga would beat out competing groups from Orlando and Tampa Bay. Orlando fielded a very spirited campaign bolstered by its family-oriented tourism industry. Tampa Bay already had a baseball parkthe Florida Suncoast Dome in St. Petersburg, completed in 1990. However, on June 10, 1991, the National League awarded a Miami-based franchise to Huizenga for a $95 million expansion fee. One name considered early on was the Florida Flamingos.[1] The franchise adopted the nickname \\"Marlins\\" from previous minor league teams, the Miami Marlins of the International League from 1956 to 1960, and the Miami Marlins (1962ÿ70) and Miami Marlins (1982ÿ88) teams that played in the Florida State League.\\r\\nIn November 1991, the Marlins hired Fredi Gonzlez as the Marlins first Minor League manager.\\r\\nOn December 16, 1991, they made their first-ever signing, inking 16-year-old Dominican pitcher Clemente N~?ez to a contract.[2] They selected catcher Charles Johnson of the University of Miami with their first-ever first round draft pick in June 1992.

Jeff Conine hit Florida's first homer before a crowd of 6,696 at the Cocoa Expo Sports Complex. The Marlins won their first game on April 5, 1993, against the Dodgers. Charlie Hough was the starting pitcher for that game. Jeff Conine went 4-4 as well, making him an immediate crowd favorite. By the end of his tenure with Florida, he would earn the nickname \\"Mr. Marlin.\\" Gary Sheffield and Bryan Harvey represented the Marlins as the club's first All-Star Game selections, and Sheffield homered in the Marlins first All-Star Game at-bat. The team finished the year five games ahead of the last-place New York Mets and with an attendance of 3,064,847. In that season, the Marlins traded their young set-up reliever Trevor Hoffman and two minor-league prospects to the San Diego Padres for third baseman Gary Sheffield. While Sheffield helped Florida immediately and became an all-star, Hoffman eventually emerged as the best closer in the National League. After the 1993 season, Donald A. Smiley was named the second President in club history. The Marlins finished last (51ÿ64) in their division in the strike-shortened season of 1994 and fourth (67-76) in 1995. Lachemann was replaced as manager midway through the 1996 season by director of player development John Boles.\\r\\nThe Marlins had some bright spots on the mound and behind the plate in 1996. The team's 3.95 ERA ranked third in the NL, thanks in large part to newcomer Kevin Brown, who finished the season with a 17ÿ11 win-loss record and an impressive 1.89 ERA. On May 11, Al Leiter pitched the first no-hitter in Marlins history. Catcher Charles Johnson led the league with a .995 fielding percentage, threw out a league-high 48 percent of base runners, and collected his second straight Gold Glove Award for fielding excellence. After a slow start, the Marlins finished the year with an 80ÿ82 win-loss record to place third in their division. Boles returned to his previous position as director of player development, and former Pittsburgh Pirates manager Jim Leyland was hired to lead the club in 1997.\\r\\nIn addition to hiring Leyland as manager, the Marlins signed third baseman Bobby Bonilla, outfielder Moiss Alou, and pitcher Alex Fernandez to lucrative free-agent contracts, raising expectations to levels far beyond anything in franchise history.\\r\\nThe Marlins franchise got its second no-hitter from ace Kevin Brown on June 10, 1997. Brown nearly had the perfect game, but he hit the Giants' Marvin Benard with a pitch in the 8th inning when Benard attempted to bunt. With Brown, Leiter, and Fernandez heading the rotation, and Robb Nen closing out games, the Marlins' staff was almost systematic during their regular season run. In 1997, the Marlins finished nine games back of the Division Champion Atlanta Braves, but earned the wild card berth. Veteran additions such as LF Moiss Alou, 3B Bobby Bonilla, and trade-deadline additions Darren Daulton and Jim Eisenreich added experience and clutch hits. Talented young stars Luis Castillo (2B) and dgar Rentera (SS) comprised one of the best double play combos in the League. Castillo did not perform to expectations offensively, and was replaced by Craig Counsell before the playoffs began. The Marlins swept the San Francisco Giants 3ÿ0 in the National League Division Series, and then went on to beat the Atlanta Braves 4ÿ2 in the National League Championship Series, overcoming the loss of Alex Fernandez to a torn rotator cuff, and Kevin Brown to a virus. Brown's place was taken in Game 5 by rookie pitcher Livn Hernndez, who had earned a spot in the rotation in the second half of the season, but was not in the rotation during the postseason. Hernandez struck out 15 Braves and outdueled multiple Cy Young Award winner Greg Maddux to a 2ÿ1 victory and a 3ÿ2 series lead. Brown returned to the mound for Game 6, pitching a complete game victory to secure the Marlins their first-ever National League pennant. The underdog Marlins went on to face the Cleveland Indians in the 1997 World Series, and won in seven games. In Game 7, Craig Counsell's sacrifice fly in the bottom of the ninth tied the game at 2, then, with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the 11th, dgar Rentera's soft liner glanced off the glove of Cleveland pitcher Charles Nagy and into center field to score Counsell and give the Marlins the win.\\r\\nFollowing the World Series victory, Huizenga dismantled the team, claiming financial losses despite winning the World Series. He traded most of the club's best players in one of the biggest fire sales in sports history. The first deal came days after the World Series, when outfielder Moiss Alou was traded to the Houston Astros for pitchers Oscar Hernandez and Manuel Barrios. The Marlins then traded Kevin Brown to the San Diego Padres for Derrek Lee and 2 minor leaguers. Finally, in May 1998, they dealt Bobby Bonilla, Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson, Jim Eisenreich, and Manuel Barrios to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile, both of whom would be gone via trades by midseason. On the flip side, these trades brought promising youngsters Derrek Lee and A. J. Burnett.\\r\\nThe Marlins slumped to 54ÿ108 in 1998, the worst record in the major leagues that year, and the most losses in franchise history. They are the only team to lose 100 games a year after winning the World Series. Leyland resigned as manager in October 1998, and was replaced by John Boles. Huizenga soon sold the club to John Henry, a commodities trader from Boca Raton, during the off-season. The Marlins had the second overall pick in the 1999 draft and drafted Josh Beckett, a high school pitcher from the Houston area.\\r\\nIn 1999, the Marlins were the first MLB team to host a game in which instant replay was used.[3] While playing the Cardinals, Cliff Floyd hit a ball to the top of the left field scoreboard. Originally ruled a home run, NL umpire Frank Pulli reversed the call to a double, after consulting a dugout TV monitor. The Cardinals won the game, 5ÿ2. After the game, the NL League Office declared the umpires erred in using instant replay. MLB would not use instant replay again for almost a decade.[4] The Marlins finished the 1999 season with the worst record in baseball at 64ÿ98, and traded World Series MVP Livn Hernndez to the San Francisco Giants. The Marlins also drafted P Johan Santana from Houston in the Rule 5 draft but traded him to Minnesota in a prearranged deal for P Jared Camp.\\r\\nA month prior to the regular season, the Marlins hired David Dombrowski as the third President in club history, making him both President and General Manager. After posting the worst record in baseball for the 1999 season, the Marlins had the first overall pick in the 2000 first-year player draft and selected first baseman Adrian Gonzalez, an 18-year-old native of Bonita, California. The Eastlake High School product agreed to terms with the Marlins that same day. The Marlins went on that season to finish 79ÿ82 and third in the NL East. This was thanks to the emergence of OF Preston Wilson who had 31 home runs and 121 RBIs. Derrek Lee and Luis Castillo broke out this year as well, as Castillo posted a .334 batting average and Lee had 28 homers in his first full season. Antonio Alfonseca posted a then-club record 45 saves.\\r\\nThe club slowly worked its way back to respectability with a third-place finish in 2000, driven by young stars such as A. J. Burnett, Brad Penny, Preston Wilson, Luis Castillo, and Mike Lowell. Burnett pitched the Marlins' third no-hitter on May 12, 2001, against the Padres, despite walking nine batters and throwing only half of his pitches for strikes. Three weeks after the no-no, Manager John Boles was fired and Hall of Famer Tony Prez was named interim manager for the rest of the season. The club finished 76ÿ86 and in fourth place, thanks to Brad Penny's and A. J. Burnett's emergence.\\r\\nThe offseason following the 2001 regular season included an overhaul of the ownership and front office. Tony Prez resigned and returned to his previous role as the front-office Baseball Operations assistant. About a month later, David Dombrowski resigned as President and General Manager of the Florida Marlins and accepted the position as President of the Detroit Tigers. Entering the new year, Henry sold the Marlins to Montreal Expos owner Jeffrey Loria, clearing the way for Henry to buy the Boston Red Sox. Loria brought the entire Expos management and coaching staff to the Marlins. David Samson became team president, Larry Beinfest became General Manager and Jeff Torborg became manager.\\r\\nPrior to the 2002 season, the Marlins traded RHP Matt Clement and RHP Antonio Alfonseca to the Cubs for RHP Julin Tavrez, LHP Dontrelle Willis, RHP Jose Cueto and C Ryan Jorgensen. The Marlins had their ups as Luis Castillo had a team record 35-game hitting streak and Kevin Millar had a 25-game hit streak. Around the All-Star break they made their second big trade, sending OF Cliff Floyd to the Expos for RHP Carl Pavano, RHP Justin Wayne, INF Mike Mordecai, LHP Graeme Lloyd, RHP Don Levinski and INF Wilton Guerrero. The same day, the Fish dealt RHP Ryan Dempster to the Cincinnati Reds for OF Juan Encarnaci܇n and LHP Ryan Snare. The Marlins finished 79ÿ83, the second-best season in team history up to that time, but their fifth straight losing season since winning the World Series.\\r\\nThe Marlins also turned their first ever triple play in franchise history on July 28, 2002.\\r\\nDuring the offseason, the Marlins signed free agent catcher Ivn Rodrguez ÿ a 10-time Gold Glove Award winner ÿ and acquired speedy outfielder Juan Pierre from the Colorado Rockies hoping to offset the loss of sluggers Cliff Floyd and Preston Wilson. The Marlins did acquire P Mike Hampton but dealt him and his hefty contract to the Braves for P Tim Spooneybarger.\\r\\nThe Marlins struggled in the opening stages of the season, going 16ÿ22. During that span, Florida lost its top three pitchers: A. J. Burnett, Josh Beckett, and Mark Redman. On May 11, Florida replaced manager Jeff Torborg with 72-year-old Jack McKeon. On May 22, the Marlins hit bottom with a major league worst record of 19ÿ29, having lost 6 straight games. However, help was on the way.\\r\\nOn May 9, the Marlins called up high-kicking southpaw Dontrelle Willis from the Double-A Carolina Mudcats and helped carry the injury-plagued Marlins with an 11ÿ2 record in his first 17 starts. Miguel Cabrera (also from the Mudcats) filled in well, hitting a walk off home run in his first major league game, against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Pro Player Stadium. Both Willis and Cabrera would later prove to be essential parts of the Marlin's playoff success. Jeff Conine ÿ an original Marlin and member of the 1997 World Series team ÿ returned from Baltimore, and closer Ugueth Urbina arrived from the Texas Rangers. These acquisitions helped to keep the team in contention, and although they finished ten games behind the Braves, the Marlins captured the NL wild card.\\r\\nThe Marlins won the Division Series against the favored San Francisco Giants three games to one. The series ended with a dramatic collision between Marlins catcher Rodrguez and Giants first baseman J. T. Snow, making it the first postseason series ever to end with the potential tying run being thrown out at the plate. It was the second time that the Marlins defeated the Giants in the Division Series, having done so in 1997.\\r\\nOn October 15, the Marlins defeated the Chicago Cubs four games to three in the Championship Series, coming back from a three games to one deficit. A Beckett complete-game shutout in Game 5 kept the Marlins alive. Game 6 saw the Marlins play a role in one of baseball's most infamous moments: \\"The Inning\\" . With 1 one out in the 8th inning and the Cubs 3 runs ahead, Marlins 2nd baseman Luis Castillo hit a pop foul a row into the stands along the third base line. Cubs fan Steve Bartman reached for the ball, preventing Cubs LF Moiss Alou from making the out and setting off an 8-run Marlins rally. The incident with Steve Bartman and a come-from-behind win in Wrigley Field in Game 7 helped the Marlins capture their second NL pennant, keeping the \\"Curse of the Billy Goat\\" alive and well.\\r\\nIn the 2003 World Series, the Marlins defeated the heavily favored New York Yankees in six games, winning the sixth game in Yankee Stadium. Shortstop lex Gonzlez helped the Marlins in Game 4 of the series with a walk off home run in extra innings. Josh Beckett was named the Most Valuable Player for the series after twirling a five-hit complete-game shutout in Game 6. Skipper Jack McKeon became the oldest manager ever to win a World Series title. The Marlins became the first opposing team to win a Series championship on the field at Yankee Stadium since 1981, when the Los Angeles Dodgers did it. The Marlins are also the last team to win a World Series at the original Yankee Stadium; the Yankees themselves would not participate in another World Series until 2009, when they defeated the then-defending champion Philadelphia Phillies at the new Yankee Stadium. The Marlins won the series despite scoring fewer runs (17) than the Yankees (21).\\r\\nThe offseason after their second World Series title, the Marlins made a questionable cost-cutting move as Derrek Lee was traded to Chicago Cubs for Hee-seop Choi and pitcher Mike Nannini. The Marlins also lost key parts of their second championship team, Ugueth Urbina and Ivn Rodrguez left via free agency (signed by the Detroit Tigers). Marlins third base coach Ozzie Guilln also departed to be manager of the Chicago White Sox. The Marlins did get good news though as Dontrelle Willis was named NL Rookie of the Year and Jack McKeon named Manager of the Year. They also signed Mike Lowell to a new four-year contract.\\r\\nAfter winning the 2003 World Series, the Marlins entered 2004 with high hopes and a retooled roster. Retaining a core of stars from their title team and hoping that newly acquired 1B Hee-seop Choi would emerge, the Marlins fell short of reaching the postseason, but they posted the third winning season in franchise history, boasting an 83-79 record. During the season, the Marlins were to make one of the biggest trades in club history as Los Angeles got P Brad Penny, 1B Choi and Double-A left-hander Bill Murphy in exchange for P Guillermo Mota, C Paul Lo Duca and OF Juan Encarnaci܇n. Pitchers Carl Pavano and Armando Bentez turned in record-setting performances. Pavano went 18-8 with a 3.30 ERA, and his 18 wins established a season high by a Marlin. Benitez became the club's season saves leader with 47 (in 51 saves attempts). Pavano, Benitez, Mike Lowell and Miguel Cabrera each enjoyed All-Star seasons, with Cabrera belting 33 homers (second-most ever in a season by a Marlin) while driving in 112 runs.\\r\\nWhile losing All-Stars Carl Pavano and Armando Bentez in the off-season, the Marlins signed P Al Leiter and 1B Carlos Delgado. Delgado's contract was the biggest in franchise history at $52 million over 4 years, with an option for a fifth year. Meanwhile, play-by-play TV broadcaster Len Kasper was also lost to the Chicago Cubs and replaced by Rich Waltz (who had previously been with the Seattle Mariners), and radio announcer John \\"Boog\\" Sciambi was replaced by Roxy Bernstein.\\r\\nWith the addition of Delgado, many sportswriters expected the Marlins to finish the 2005 season in either first or second place in the NL East. However, at the All-Star break they were 44ÿ42, and the NL East was unusually competitive, as all five of its teams had a winning record at the break. While Cabrera, Willis, and several others posted very good first-half numbers, Lowell was one of the least productive regular major-league starters, and Leiter went 3ÿ7 with an ERA of 6.64 before being traded to the New York Yankees on July 15 for a player to be named later. Additionally, Guillermo Mota, who was acquired by Florida in 2004 along with Paul Lo Duca and Juan Encarnaci܇n and was expected to be their closer, was inconsistent, and the Marlins gave the closer job to veteran Todd Jones, whom they signed in the offseason. However, the Marlins did send four players to the All-Star Game (Willis, Lo Duca, Castillo, and Cabrera), tying a team record.\\r\\nThe club was expected to be quite active at the trading deadline (July 31), as Burnett was slated to be a free agent after the season and had already declared his desire to test the market like Pavano did. Burnett was mentioned in possible trades with the Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Toronto Blue Jays, and Texas Rangers, with many rumors also including Lowell or Encarnacion. The Marlins did not make a huge move at the deadline, instead trading minor-leaguer Yorman Bazardo to the Seattle Mariners for left-handed pitcher Ron Villone.\\r\\nThe Marlins did have some pleasant surprises during the season. Dontrelle Willis became the 13th member of the Black Aces when he defeated the Washington Nationals to earn his 20th win. He finished the season 22-10 with a 2.63 ERA, and he was considered a favorite to win the Cy Young Award for much of the season. Also, Jones, a journeyman who had been signed as a setup man, had one of the best years of his career as a closer; he earned 40 saves and had a 2.13 ERA. In addition, late-season call up Jeremy Hermida, a highly regarded prospect who has been compared to the Atlanta Braves' Jeff Francoeur, hit a pinch-hit grand slam in his first major-league at-bat and a game-tying two-run homer in the last game of the season.\\r\\nThe Marlins led the NL wild-card race as late as September 13, then lost 12 of their next 14 games. The Marlins closed the season by sweeping the Braves, and their final record for the season stood at 83ÿ79. After the season, lingering stadium issues forced the Marlins to ponder big moves with their roster and also ponder possible relocation to another city.\\r\\nThe 2005 offseason would prove to be one of busiest for the Marlins in years, Jack McKeon announced his retirement on October 2 after the Marlins' last game of the season. Former Tampa Bay Devil Rays manager Lou Piniella, Braves third base coach Fredi Gonzlez (who previously managed in the Marlins' farm system), New York Yankees bench coach Joe Girardi, and even Yankees manager Joe Torre who most thought could have been let go after a short stint postseason, were named as possible replacements for McKeon.[5] On October 19, Girardi was hired as the new manager. Girardi, who was hired at age 41, became one of the youngest current managers in the major leagues at the time.[6]\\r\\nFew of the coaching staff, aside from infield/first base coach Perry Hill and bullpen coordinator Pierre Arsenault, were expected to return. Pitching coach Mark Wiley and bullpen coach Luis Dorante came under fire during the season due to the late-season struggles of Burnett and the season-long struggles of the Marlins' bullpen. Similarly, hitting coach Bill Robinson was often blamed for the Marlins' offensive woes throughout the season, and in particular for his failure to get Pierre and Lowell out of season-long slumps. Girardi hired Jim Presley as a replacement for Robinson, and also hired Rick Kranitz as the new pitching coach and Bobby Meacham as the new third-base coach.\\r\\nOn October 3, the first day after the end of the regular season, the Marlins made their first offseason moves, releasing relief pitchers John Riedling and Tim Spooneybarger. Riedling had a 4ÿ1 record and a 7.14 ERA during the season; Spooneybarger, who had not played since 2003 due to rehabilitation from Tommy John surgery, had to have the surgery a second time during the season and missed the 2006 season as well. Screwball specialist Jim Mecir retired following the Marlins' last game of the season.\\r\\nCloser Todd Jones, pitchers A. J. Burnett, Brian Moehler, Ismael Valdz, Paul Quantrill, first baseman Jeff Conine, infielder Lenny Harris, outfielder Juan Encarnaci܇n, and shortstop lex Gonzlez were among the Marlins' players whose contracts expired following the 2005 season. Burnett signed a five-year deal with the Toronto Blue Jays worth $55 million and Jones signed for two years with the Detroit Tigers, while Moehler elected to remain with the Marlins. The team declined to offer arbitration to Conine, Valdz, Quantrill, Encarnaci܇n, Damion Easley, and Mike Mordecai, effectively ending their tenures with the club.[7] Soon after announcing a plan to relocate (see below), the Marlins started to shed payroll by dealing their highest-paid players for minor league prospects, in a series of moves reminiscent of the \\"fire sale\\" in the 1997 offseason. In response, the club announced that it was, in their opinion, a \\"market correction\\", brought about by the lack of a stadium deal.[8] On November 24, Josh Beckett, Mike Lowell, and Guillermo Mota were traded to the Red Sox for four minor-league prospects: shortstop Hanley Ramrez, and pitchers Anbal Snchez, Jes~s Delgado, and Harvey Garca. The trade left Dontrelle Willis as the only remaining member of the team's 2005 Opening Day rotation. The Marlins filled most of the remaining rotation spots with young pitchers such as Jason Vargas, Josh Johnson, and Scott Olsen, all of whom they had recalled from their Class AA affiliate during the 2005 season.[9]\\r\\nOn November 23, the Mets and the Marlins agreed on a deal to move Carlos Delgado to the Mets for first baseman Mike Jacobs and pitching prospect Yusmeiro Petit. Also, the Marlins would have to pay $7 million of Delgado's remaining contract. When the deal was made official the next day, the Marlins also received minor-league infielder Grant Psomas. According to the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, the Marlins passed up the Mets' offer to give them center fielder Lastings Milledge, who was at the time ranked the Mets' top prospect according to Baseball America.[10] Combined, the two trades allowed the Marlins to reduce their 2006 payroll by $27 million.\\r\\nHowever, the Marlins were not yet done reducing payroll. Paul Lo Duca was traded to the Mets for two players to be named later, with the Marlins sending pitcher Gabriel Hernandez and outfielder Dante Brinkley to New York to complete the deal. Longtime second baseman Luis Castillo was traded to the Twins for pitchers Travis Bowyer and Scott Tyler, and Juan Pierre to the Cubs for pitchers Sergio Mitre, Ricky Nolasco, and Renyel Pinto. Of the seven players that the Marlins acquired in these three deals, only Mitre and Bowyer had any major-league experience when they came to the Marlins. To replace Castillo, the Marlins signed veteran Pokey Reese, but Reese was released during spring training after going AWOL, and was replaced by Dan Uggla, who had been selected from the Arizona Diamondbacks in the Rule 5 draft. Uggla played in the Arizona organization at the Class AA level in 2005.\\r\\nAt the start of the year, the Marlins had a team salary close to $21 million. Not only was it the lowest team salary in all of MLB, but New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez alone made more money than the entire Marlins team. The Marlins made MLB history when they started six rookies in their Opening Day lineup.[11] Sporting the league's youngest team, the Marlins were predicted before the season to lose more than 100 games. Instead, the youthful squad greatly exceeded expectations, often in historical fashion. After getting off to an 11-31 start, the Marlins found themselves at 73-72 on September 12, making them the first team in the modern baseball era to improve to better than .500 after being as much as 20 games under .500. Also, for the first time in MLB history, four rookies topped double digits in wins: Josh Johnson, Scott Olsen, Ricky Nolasco and Anbal Snchez.\\r\\nOn September 6, 2006, Sanchez threw the fourth no-hitter in franchise history, beating Arizona, 2-0, at Dolphin Stadium. Miguel Cabrera finished second in the N.L. in batting average, and set a franchise season mark with his .339 average. Dan Uggla became the first Rule 5 pick to be selected to the All-Star Game in the season in which he was drafted and won Sporting News Rookie of the Year for the National League and won the Players' Choice award as the league's most outstanding rookie. Hanley Ramrez won the N.L. Rookie of the Year Award, and Joe Girardi was voted N.L. Manager of the Year. Dan Uggla finished third in the voting and starting pitcher Josh Johnson, fourth; starting pitchers Scott Olsen and Anbal Snchez and left fielder Josh Willingham received one third-place vote each.\\r\\nAdditionally, the Marlins had four of their rookie starting pitchers (Anbal Snchez, Josh Johnson, Scott Olsen, and Ricky Nolasco) win at least ten games, becoming the first team in major-league history to do so. The 2006 Marlins also had five ten-game winners for the first time in franchise history (including Dontrelle Willis).\\r\\nShortly after the 2006 season ended and following months of speculation, Marlins manager Joe Girardi was fired on October 3, 2006 not long after winning the National League Manager of the Year award. This was due to a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers earlier in the year in which Girardi did not challenge a call that pitcher Taylor Tankersley thought was a strike and this prompted owner Jeffrey Loria, who was in the stands and a few feet away from the dugout, to call out Girardi who refused to listen to him. This wasn't the only thing that triggered the feud; earlier in the year Girardi reportedly wanted 1B Mike Jacobs to start off the year in triple A, Willingham to start at catcher, Miguel Cabrera to start at first base.[12] Within hours, Atlanta Braves third base coach Fredi Gonzlez was named his replacement and was signed to a three-year contract.\\r\\nAfter a 2006 season which saw them defy expectations time and again, the Marlins entered 2007 hanging on to the belief that they could compete with anyone. It didn't turn out that way. Injuries ravaged the starting rotation and the Marlins struggled all season, ultimately finishing in last place in the National League East for the first time since 1999. Josh Johnson underwent Tommy John surgery and Anbal Snchez had right shoulder surgery. Ricky Nolasco dealt with a sore elbow all season. Suddenly, the strength of the teamthe starting rotationwas minus three key players. Despite a disappointing finish, there certainly were a number of highsKevin Gregg emerged as a dominant closer, Hanley Ramrez developed into a legitimate superstar and Miguel Cabrera proved why he already was onebut none of them could ultimately overcome the odds heavily stacked against the Marlins. On the downside, southpaws Dontrelle Willis and Scott Olsen had disappointing campaigns. What was encouraging was an otherwise disappointing season ended on a high note. The team won five of six to end the season (sweeping the Cubs and taking two of three with the Mets at Shea Stadium). Still, after the season, the franchise went in a different direction. The year was capped by the trading of their two biggest stars, slugger Miguel Cabrera and pitcher Dontrelle Willis. Talks with both the Los Angeles Angels and San Francisco Giants fell apart. On December 5, 2007, the Marlins agreed to the terms of a trade with the Detroit Tigers. The trade would surprisingly send not only Cabrera, but also Willis, to the Tigers. In return, the Marlins did not receive four players, but six. The Marlins received center fielder Cameron Maybin, catcher Mike Rabelo, and pitchers Andrew Miller, Eulogio De La Cruz, Burke Badenhop, and Dallas Trahern.\\r\\nThe Marlins did have some bright spots on offense as they set club records for runs scored (790), hits (1,504), doubles (340), home runs (201), RBIs (749) and slugging percentage (.448). As the Marlins wrapped up the season they announced that pitching coach Rick Kranitz would not be back with the club and extended Larry Beinfest and Michael Hill to long term deals that run through 2015 along with promotions to President of Baseball Operations and Vice President/General Manager, respectively.,[13][14]\\r\\nThe Marlins began 2008 on a positive note. Analysts expected a lackluster performance on the field, citing the low payroll and loss of Dontrelle Willis and Miguel Cabrera during the offseason. However, the Marlins got off to one of the best starts in team history. At one point the Marlins were 30ÿ20, the first time since September 14, 2005 the team had been 10 games over .500. They jumped atop of the National League East in April and May, the first time since 2002 that they held the lead that late in the season. The good start was attributed to powerful offensive production from their core of Mike Jacobs, Hanley Ramrez, Dan Uggla, Josh Willingham, and Jorge Cant~ and quality pitching by southpaw Scott Olsen and right-hander Ricky Nolasco. The Marlins' hot start made them a rare buyer at the July trade deadline, where they were involved in talks on a three-way deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates and Boston Red Sox which could have brought Manny Ramrez to South Florida. The Marlins backed out at the last second when trade talks turned to their coveted power-hitting prospect, Giancarlo Stanton. Instead, Manny Ramrez ended up with the Dodgers and the Marlins wound up trading for Arthur Rhodes.\\r\\nThe team also received encouraging news when injured pitcher Josh Johnson made a fast recovery from Tommy John surgery and Anbal Snchez came back from a torn labrum in the shoulder, both leaping into the rotation right away along with newly called up prized prospect Chris Volstad. In addition, the Marlins sent two players, Hanley Ramrez, who started the game at shortstop, and reserve Dan Uggla to the last All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium. The Marlins signed Hanley Ramrez to a 6-year, $70 million deal, making him the richest Marlin in history.\\r\\nThe team struggled in the month of August, when they went 11ÿ16 due to lack of the offense they had in the early part of the season. In September, the Marlins rallied with a nine-game winning streak, tying the franchise record, thanks in part to prized prospect, Cameron Maybin. However they lost four straight afterwards and were eliminated from playoff contention, although but they did manage to eliminate the New York Mets for the second consecutive season on the final day, winning the final game at Shea Stadium, 4-2.\\r\\nThe team finished with a franchise record for most home runs in a season at 208. Mike Jacobs, Dan Uggla, Hanley Ramrez and Jorge Cant~ made MLB history by becoming the first foursome of infielders to hit at least 25 homers in a season. Just a day after the World Series concluded, the Marlins began wheeling and dealing. They traded first baseman Mike Jacobs to the Royals for reliever Leo N~?ez, who the Marlins hoped could become a setup-man in late innings. A few weeks later, the Marlins traded power hitting outfielder Josh Willingham and southpaw Scott Olsen to the Nationals for utility player Emilio Bonifacio and two minor leaguers. Soon after the Marlins traded closer Kevin Gregg to the Cubs for relief prospect Jos Ceda.\\r\\nA few weeks before the regular season, the Florida Marlins' 15-year quest for a permanent home became a reality by agreeing to bankroll a big share of a $634 million stadium complex to rise on the grounds of the old Orange Bowl site. The Marlins hoped to open at the new stadium on Opening Day 2012 with a new name of Miami Marlins.\\r\\nThe Marlins kicked off the new season with the youngest team in baseball and with the lowest payroll for the fourth consecutive season. New leadoff man Emilio Bonifacio stole the show on Opening Day. He hit the first Opening Day inside-the-park home run since Carl Yastrzemski did it for the Boston Red Sox in 1968 and had three stolen bases to go along with four hits. Hanley Ramrez hit his first career grand slam as the Marlins went on to score 12 runs, the most ever in franchise history on Opening Day.\\r\\nThe Marlins started the 2009 season hot by sweeping the Washington Nationals, only the second time they started the season with sweep since the 1997 Marlins team. The Marlins won their first four games for the first time in franchise history and started 11ÿ1, which included 2 out of 3 wins from the Mets, the first Marlins franchise sweep at Turner Field, and three comeback late-inning wins against the Nationals in Washington, sweeping the teams' second series matchup. The 11ÿ1 start was the best start in Marlins history. They then lost their next seven games starting with the 62-99 Pittsburgh Pirates making them the first team in NL history to win seven straight games then lose the next seven. But even though they were below .500 by as many as five games, they rebounded to 2 games above .500 as of July 1, 2009. Cody Ross, the leader of the rebound, hit 2 grand slams in 2 weeks. The Marlins also amazed many in the final series before the All-Star break against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Originally trailing by seven runs after five innings, the Marlins entered the eighth inning down 7-4, they sent 14 batters to the plate. In the benchmark frame, they collected eight hits, and had eight different players score for a total of ten runs in the inning. In all the Marlins collected 14 unanswered runs as they came back for their 21st come from behind victory of the season. After the first 100 games of the season they stood second in the NL East with a record of 52-48.\\r\\nComing out of the All-Star break, the Marlins were swept in three games by the Phillies, but they responded by sweeping the Padres in San Diego before taking two of three against the Dodgers. That 5-1 West Coast road tripfrom July 20ÿ26reinforced to management that the team was in contention. Instead of being sellers at the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline, first baseman Nick Johnson was acquired from the Nationals for pitching prospect Aaron Thompson, in the hopes that Johnson would bring his renowned plate discipline to the forefront of the Marlins' lineup. However other rumors began to surface that the team was exploring options in deals that would bring major players to Florida, including superstars Roy Halladay and Adrian Gonzalez, as well as closer Heath Bell.\\r\\nIn August, the Marlins offense would take off. Rookie Chris Coghlan set a club record with ten consecutive multihit games. In addition, the Marlins would set a team record with 14 consecutive games with 10 or more hits, becoming the first team since the 1937 St. Louis Browns to reach that milestone.[15][16] August would also see the Marlins sweeping the division leading Philadelphia Phillies after getting swept by the division cellar Washington Nationals. In light of being in the playoff race, the Marlins were rumored to have been targeting veteran pitchers John Smoltz and ex-Marlin Brad Penny.[17][18] The Marlins ended the 2009 Season with their 3rd best record in franchise history, 87-75, topped only by the 1997 (92 wins) and 2003 (91) World Series championship teams. However, the status of Fredi Gonzlez for the 2010 season was put in question when a report by ESPN's Buster Olney said the Marlins had made contact with Bobby Valentine. The Marlins put those rumors to rest days later confirming that the all-time winningest manager in franchise history would remain at the helm. On the other hand, pitching coach Mark Wiley and infield/first-base coach Andy Fox were not retained.\\r\\nSoon after the World Series, the Marlins began their off-season. On November 5, Jeremy Hermida was dealt to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for 2 prospects, pitchers Hunter Jones and Jos lvarez. The team also saw a higher number of awards handed out to the team, as Ramirez notched his second straight Silver Slugger award, and Chris Coghlan was named the National League Rookie of the Year. Miami native and Marlins' Special Assistant to the President Andre Dawson was elected by the eligible members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America to the 2010 Class of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Dawson played with the Marlins in his final two seasons (1995 & 1996)[19] The Marlins were also active on the international front, targeting and offering Cuban defector Aroldis Chapman a five-year offer worth $16 million, but lost out to the Cincinnati Reds, who signed the heralded lefty for $30 million for over six years.[20]\\r\\nThe Marlins announced in a statement on January 5, 2010, in preparation for the move to the new ballpark and name change, that the Marlins road jersey would no longer bear the name \\"Florida\\" on the front. Also the \\"F\\" marlin sleeve patch would no longer be on the jersey.[21]\\r\\nOn January 12, 2010, as part of an agreement between Major League Baseball and the players' union, the Marlins agreed to increase payroll in line with the money it receives each year from revenue sharing. It could have meant that the Marlins would be more inclined to hang on to All-Star second baseman Dan Uggla rather than trade him as they had been trying to do for several months.[22] A few days after agreeing with MLB to increase payroll, the Marlins signed their ace right-hander, Josh Johnson to a four-year deal worth $39 million, the second biggest contract ever for a pitcher heading into his second salary arbitration year. The only bigger deal was signed by Johan Santana, then of the NY Mets, for $40 million over four years. The deal locked up the team's pitching ace beyond the opening of the new stadium in 2012, along with Hanley Ramrez.[23] Not too long after the deal, the Marlins avoided arbitration with all-star second baseman Dan Uggla by signing a one-year, $7.8 million deal which was the third-highest single season total in franchise history behind Ivn Rodrguez's $10 million in 2003 and Gary Sheffield's $14.9 million in 1998.[24]\\r\\nComing out of spring training, there were playoff aspirations for the Marlins, which had held the same nucleus since 2006 despite the fact they had the National League's third-lowest payroll. Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria expressed high hopes saying, \\"I expect us to make the playoffs, we've got all the ammunition we need.\\"\\r\\nHowever, those aspirations proved to be misplaced, as little went right in Miami. In mid-May, Hanley Ramrez was suspended for a game by manager Fredi Gonzlez for not hustling towards a fly ball which cost the team runs and a loss. Nearly two weeks later, Roy Halladay threw a perfect game against Florida, which was the first one thrown against the Marlins in franchise history.\\r\\nOn June 23, with the team sitting at 34-36 along with having a shaky bullpen and inconsistent situational hitting and bench, Loria decided to fire Fredi Gonzlez along with bench coach Carlos Tosca and hitting coach Jim Presley on June 23. At the time of his dismissal, Gonzalez's record for the season was 32-34. Edwin Rodriguez was promoted from Triple-A New Orleans as Florida's new manager. Sandwiched between those two announcements were talks with former Rangers and Mets manager Bobby Valentine but those talks broke down. Edwin Rodriguez's first game was a June 23 win against the Baltimore Orioles.\\r\\nOther disappointments came in the way of injuries to core players, Chris Coghlan, the 2009 NL Rookie of the Year, tore the meniscus in his left knee while jamming a shaving-cream pie in Wes Helms' face. Ricky Nolasco tore the meniscus in his right knee when he took off a shoe. When all was said and done, a club-record 57 players rotated through the clubhouse.\\r\\nAt the All-Star Break, Hanley Ramrez participated in the State Farm Home Run Derby and became the first Marlin to reach the finals. Ramirez lost to David Ortiz but set a Marlins record for most home runs hit in the Derby with 26.\\r\\nAfter the All-Star Break, the Marlins went on a surge, getting off to an 11-5 start thanks in large part to Dan Uggla, who also set a Marlins franchise record for total home runs at 144, passing Mike Lowell. In that same week (July 19-July 25), the Marlins had four walk-off base hits, two by Donnie Murphy and one each from Ronny Paulino and Wes Helms. It was that week which brought up the need to be buyers at the trade deadline. Considered in contention for the playoffs, the Marlins traded Rick VandenHurk to the Baltimore Orioles for lefty Will Ohman to shore up a shaky bullpen.\\r\\nThe second half also saw the emergence of rookie outfielders Michael Stanton and Logan Morrison, who replaced the injured Chris Coghlan. Rookie first baseman Gaby Snchez also put up good numbers, at the top of most lists in home runs, RBIs, and batting average, to contend for the NL Rookie of the Year award.\\r\\nThe Marlins 2010 season was considered a disappointment, as they finished under .500 for the first time since 2007.\\r\\nSoon after the World Series, the team began its offseason on trying to improve its defense and bullpen while filling a dire need at catcher. Out of the gate, the Florida Marlins became one of the most active teams on the market. After retaining Edwin Rodrguez and bringing back defensive guru Perry Hill, the team traded the disappointing results of the notorious Miguel CabreraÿDontrelle Willis trade. Andrew Miller was the first to go when he was traded to the Boston Red Sox on November 12 in exchange for another lefty, Dustin Richardson, a relief pitcher. The next day, the team shipped out young center fielder Cameron Maybin to the San Diego Padres for relief pitchers Ryan Webb and Edward Mujica to help in the expected overhaul of the team's disappointing bullpen.\\r\\nAs soon as the season ended, the team began negotiations for a long-term deal that would keep All-Star second baseman Dan Uggla with the team. After rejecting the team's offer of $48 million over four years because of his desire for a fifth year totaling $71 million,[25] the team reached a stalemate with Uggla, meaning his days with the team were numbered. Days later on November 16, in order to get some kind of return for Uggla, the team dealt him to their divisional rivals, the Atlanta Braves, for fellow All-Star and utility man Omar Infante and relief pitcher Mike Dunn.\\r\\nEarlier in that same day, the team came to terms on a three-year deal with All-Star catcher John Buck, formerly of the Kansas City Royals and Toronto Blue Jays. With even more money left to spend, the team later signed free agent pitcher Javier Vzquez to a one-year, $7 million contract which had a no-trade clause. It signaled a change in the philosophy of the franchise who hadn't made such a free agent signing since 2005 when they had signed Carlos Delgado to a multi-year contract.\\r\\nThe team wasn't done yet, as they signed yet another of their current players to an extension. Ricky Nolasco agreed to a three-year deal that would pay him $26.5 million through 2013, making him one of five players on the roster with a multi-year contract (the others being Hanley Ramrez, Josh Johnson, John Buck, and Randy Choate).\\r\\nAfter the Marlins began the season with the best start in franchise history through 50 games (30ÿ20), they had one of the worst runs in MLB history. Starting the month of June with a .053 winning percentage (1ÿ18), manager Edwin Rodrguez resigned, and the Marlins hired former manager and special assistant to the GM Jack McKeon. The Marlins finished the month at a franchise worst 5ÿ23, but began July at 10ÿ4. The Marlins dropped from the second-best record in the National League to last place in the National League East. In the final 112 games of the season, the Marlins played 40ÿ72, finishing with 72 wins and 90 losses, last in the National League East.\\r\\nFor the first 19?years of its existence, the team played its home games at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens. In 2012, it moved into the newly-constructed Marlins Park in Miami's Little Havana.\\r\\nIn September 2011, the Marlins acquired manager Ozzie Guilln in a trade with the Chicago White Sox. The Marlins unveiled a new set of uniforms and color schemes on November 11, 2011, officially becoming the \\"Miami Marlins\\". They signed several high-profile free agents during the off-season in Jose Reyes, Heath Bell, and former White Sox pitcher Mark Buehrle, who played for Ozzie Guilln from 2004 to 2011. They opened Marlins Park and the 2012 season against the St. Louis Cardinals on April 4, losing 4ÿ1. The Marlins struggled through the first 100 games, only winning 46, despite going a franchise record 21ÿ8 through May, resulting in the trades of Omar Infante, Anbal Snchez, and Hanley Ramrez. The team finished 69ÿ93, its worst record since 1999. This resulted in Guilln being fired after one season. Mike Redmond succeeded him as the Marlins' manager. There was another fire sale, with the sale of almost every other major Marlins player of 2012 but Giancarlo Stanton.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2013, the team started the season with consecutive losses to the Washington Nationals, 0-2, 0-3, and 1-6. The Marlins finished 62ÿ100, the second 100-loss season for the team, and the first since 1998. However, the season ended on a good note, as the Marlins, already out of contention, beat the Detroit Tigers as Henderson lvarez threw the franchise's fifth no-hitter in a 1-0 season-ending victory at Marlins Park and Jos Fernndez won the NL Rookie of the Year.\\r\\nPrior to the 2014 season, the Marlins acquired several hitters in an attempt to supplement their strong pitching and defense, including Garrett Jones, Casey McGehee, Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Rafael Furcal. The Marlins finished 77ÿ85 in 2014, losing both Jos Fernndez and Giancarlo Stanton to major injuries. After the season's conclusion, Stanton was signed to the largest contract in MLB history: 13?years and $325?million. The Marlins then acquired Aaron Crow from the Kansas City Royals, Dee Gordon and Dan Haren from the Los Angeles Dodgers, and Mat Latos from the Cincinnati Reds and then signed free agents Michael Morse and Ichiro Suzuki, who became the first-ever Japanese-born Marlin in franchise history.[26]\\r\\nWith the Marlins' talented roster, they entered the 2015 season with high expectations. However, after beginning the season 16ÿ22, Redmond was fired from the Marlins' managerial position on May 17.[27] Then-general manager Dan Jennings replaced Redmond as manager, despite Jennings having never previously coached or managed in any MLB organization.[28]\\r\\nTragedy struck the Miami Marlins on September 25, 2016, when star pitcher Jos Fernndez died in a boating accident.\\r\\nIn 2017, Jeffrey Loria advertised for bids to sell the Miami Marlins. Former New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter expressed interest in being involved with an ownership group, attempting initially to join a bid with former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Eventually, he became a minority partner in the eventual winning bid, a $1.2-billion offer led by Bruce Sherman, which was accepted on August 11, 2017.[29] The bid was officially submitted to Major League Baseball for analysis and approval on August 15.[30]","input":"When did the florida marlins become miami marlins?"},{"output":"arthrodial joint","context":"The proximal tibiofibular articulation (also called superior tibiofibular joint) is an arthrodial joint between the lateral condyle of the tibia and the head of the fibula.\\r\\nThe contiguous surfaces of the bones present flat, oval facets covered with cartilage and connected together by an articular capsule and by anterior and posterior ligaments.\\r\\nWhen the term \\"tibiofibular articulation\\" is used without a modifier, it refers to the proximal, and not the distal tibiofibular articulation = Inferior tibiofibular joint.\\r\\nThis article incorporates text in the public domain from the 20th edition of Gray's Anatomy (1918)","input":"What type of joint is the proximal tibiofibular?"},{"output":"22,513 students","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBall State University, commonly referred to as Ball State or BSU, is a public coeducational research university in Muncie, Indiana, United States, with two satellite facilities in Fishers and Indianapolis. On July 25, 1917, the Ball brothers, industrialists and founders of the Ball Corporation, acquired the foreclosed Indiana Normal Institute for $35,100 and gave the school and surrounding land to the State of Indiana. The Indiana General Assembly accepted the donation in the spring of 1918, with an initial 235 students enrolling at the Indiana State Normal School ÿ Eastern Division on June 17, 1918.\\r\\n\\r\\nBall State is classified by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education[4] as a doctoral university: higher research activity.  The university is composed of eight academic colleges.  As of  2017[update], total enrollment was 22,513 students,[5] including 17,004 undergraduates and 5,509 postgraduates. The university offers about 190 undergraduate majors and 130 minor areas of study[6] and more than 140 master's, doctoral, certificate, and specialist degrees.[7] There are more than 400 student organizations and clubs on campus,[8] including 34 fraternities and sororities.[9] Ball State athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are known as the Ball State Cardinals. The university is a member of the Mid-American Conference and the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location of today's Ball State University had its start in 1899 as a private university called the Eastern Indiana Normal School. The entire school, including classrooms, library, and president's residence were housed in what is today's Frank A. Bracken Administration Building. The one-building school had a peak enrollment of 256 and charged $10 for a year's tuition. It operated until the spring of 1901, when it was closed by its president, F.A.Z. Kumler, due to lack of funding. A year later, in the autumn of 1902, the school reopened as Palmer University for the next three years when Francis Palmer, a retired Indiana banker, gave the school a $100,000 endowment.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1905 and 1917, the school dropped the Palmer name and operated as the Indiana Normal College. It had two divisions, the Normal School for educating teachers and the College of Applied Sciences. The school had an average enrollment of about 200 students. Due to diminishing enrollment and lack of funding, school president Francis Ingler closed Indiana Normal College at the end of the 1906ÿ1907 school year. Between 1907 and 1912, the campus sat unused. In 1912, a group of local investors led by Michael Kelly reopened the school as the Indiana Normal Institute. To pay for updated materials and refurbishing the once-abandoned Administration Building, the school operated under a mortgage from the Muncie Trust Company. Although the school had its largest student body with a peak enrollment of 806, officials could not maintain mortgage payments, and the school was forced to close once again in June 1917 when the Muncie Trust Company initiated foreclosure proceedings.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 25, 1917, the Ball brothers, local industrialists and founders of the Ball Corporation, bought the Indiana Normal Institute from foreclosure. The Ball Brothers also founded Ball Memorial Hospital and Minnetrista, and were the benefactors of Keuka College, founded by their uncle, George Harvey Ball.[10] For $35,100, the Ball brothers bought the Administration Building and surrounding land. In early 1918, during the Indiana General Assembly's short session, state legislators accepted the gift of the school and land by the Ball Brothers. The state granted operating control of the Muncie campus and school buildings to the administrators of the Indiana State Normal School in Terre Haute. That same year, the Marion Normal Institute relocated to Muncie, adding its resources to what would officially be named the Indiana State Normal School ÿ Eastern Division. An initial 235 students enrolled on June 17, 1918, with William W. Parsons assuming the role as first president of the university.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe close relationship between the Balls and the school led to an unofficial moniker for the college, with many students, faculty, and local politicians casually referring to the school as \\"Ball State,\\" a shorthand alternative to its longer, official name. During the 1922 short session of the Indiana legislature, the state renamed the school as Ball Teachers College. This was in recognition to the Ball family's continuing beneficence to the institution. During this act, the state also reorganized its relationship with Terre Haute and established a separate local board of trustees for the Muncie campus. In 1924, Ball Teachers College's trustees hired Benjamin J. Burris as the successor to President Linnaeus N. Hines. The Ball brothers continued giving to the university and partially funded the construction of the Science Hall (now called Burkhardt Building) in 1924 and an addition to Ball Gymnasium in 1925. By the 1925ÿ1926 school year, Ball State enrollment reached 991 students: 697 women and 294 men. Based on the school's close relationship with the Ball Corporation, a long-running nickname for the school was \\"Fruit Jar Tech.\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the regular legislative session of 1929, the General Assembly nominally separated the Terre Haute and Muncie campuses of the state teachers college system, but it placed the governing of the Ball State campus under the Indiana State Teachers College Board of Trustees based in Terre Haute.[12] With this action, the school was renamed Ball State Teachers College. The following year, enrollment increased to 1,118, with 747 female and 371 male students.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1935, the school added the Fine Arts Building for art, music, and dance instruction. Enrollment that year reached 1,151: 723 women and 428 men. As an expression of the many gifts from the Ball family since 1917, sculptor Daniel Chester French was commissioned by Muncie's chamber of commerce to cast a bronze fountain figure to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Ball brothers' gift to the state. His creation, the statue Beneficence, still stands today between the Administration Building and Lucina Hall where Talley Avenue ends at University Avenue.\\r\\n\\r\\nBall State, like the rest of nation was affected by the onset of World War II. There were a number of dramatic changes on Ball State's campus during World War II. In 1939 Ball State began its Civilian Pilot Training program which had popular enrollment.[13] This program allowed students and local resident to learn to fly, instructed by the Muncie Aviation Company. By the fall of 1941 Ball State reached its peek enrollment to this point of 1,588 students.[13] When the United States ended the war, Ball State like many other college campuses, saw a decline in male enrollment. At this time Ball State partnered with the United States Military and established two training programs on campus, the Army Specialized Training Program and Navy V-1 Program. Each of these programs encouraged male enrollment in the college that also trained them to gone on as pilots in the military service.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nBall State students and Staff also contributed to the war effort by supporting the troops abroad. Students and staff led by Sherly DeMotte, a member of the English faculty, wrote dozens of letters to Ball State students and staff serving overseas.[14] By 1943 a dozen students from Ball State had become war casualties. To bring awareness to their service, in 1943 the War Morale Committee headed by Dr LaFollette in collaboration with the class of 1943, dedicated the Roll of Honor in April. This memorial wall listed the names of all those who served during the war. By the War's end, forty eight students had given their lives in the service and Ball State had trained more than 1,200 pilots in their training program. Those who paid the ultimate sacrifice were honored by Ball State in 1946 in their \\"Gold Star Memorial Service\\" in which surviving family members of those students were invited and to the school and honored by students and staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1961, Ball State became independent of The Indiana State University through the creation of the Ball State College Board of Trustees.[12] The official name of the school was also changed to Ball State College. The Indiana General Assembly approved the development of a state-assisted architecture program, establishing the College of Architecture and Planning, which opened on March 23, 1965. The Center for Radio and Television (now named the College of Communication, Information, and Media) opened the following year, in 1966.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecognizing the college's expanding academic curriculum and growing enrollment (10,066 students), the General Assembly approved renaming the school to Ball State University in 1965. Most of the university's largest residence halls were completed during this period of high growth, including DeHority Complex (1960), Noyer Complex (1962), Studebaker Complex (1965), LaFollette Complex (1967), and Johnson Complex (1969). Academic and athletic buildings, including Irving Gymnasium (1962), Emens Auditorium (1964), Cooper Science Complex (1967), Scheumann Stadium (1967), Carmichael Hall (1969), Teachers College Building (1969), Pruis Hall (1972), and Bracken Library (1974), also expanded the university's capacity and educational opportunities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university experienced another building boom beginning in the 2000s, with the openings of the Art and Journalism Building (2001), Shafer Tower (2001), the Music Instruction Building (2004), the David Letterman Communication and Media Building (2007), Park Hall (2007), Kinghorn Hall (2010), Marilyn K. Glick Center for Glass (2010), and the Student Recreation and Wellness Center (2010).[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the university's 14th president, Dr. Jo Ann Gora, over $520 million was committed to new construction and renovation projects throughout the Ball State campus.[15] Within the last decade, Ball State University adopted Education Redefined as its motto, focusing on \\"immersive learning\\" with the goal of engaging students across all academic programs in real-world projects. To date, there have been over 1,250 immersive learning projects, impacting residents in all of Indiana's 92 counties under the mentoring of faculty from every academic department.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university has also adopted environmental sustainability as a primary component to the university's strategic plan and vision.[16] Starting in the mid-2000s, all building additions and renovations are designed to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification standards.[17] Ball State announced in 2009 that it would begin construction on the largest geothermal energy conversion project in U.S. history.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university was defendant in the U.S. Supreme Court case Vance v. Ball State University, which dealt with who can be regarded as a \\"supervisor\\" for the purposes of harassment lawsuits. The case was argued November 26, 2012. In a 5ÿ4 decision, the court ruled in favor of Ball State on June 24, 2013.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nBall State University's campus spans 731 acres (296?ha) and includes 109 buildings at 7,203,801 square feet (669,255.0?m2)[20] centered mostly on two main quadrangles. (The university also has just over 400 additional acres of research property.) The original quadrangle, \\"Old Quad,\\" anchors the south end of campus and includes most of the university's earliest academic buildings, Christy Woods, and the Wheeler-Thanhauser Orchid Collection and Species Bank. The focal points of the Old Quad are Beneficence and the Fine Arts Building, home to the David Owsley Museum of Art since 1935. The museum contains some 11,000 works valued at more than $40 million.[21] The museum expanded its total exhibition space in 2013 from 17,846-to-26,514-square-foot (1,657.9 to 2,463.2?m2).[22] The Fine Arts Terrace, overlooking the Old Quad, hosts the annual spring commencement ceremonies.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newer quadrangle is located to the north and consists of a variety of modern buildings (1960ÿpresent), with such landmarks as Bracken Library, Emens Auditorium, and the Frog Baby Fountain, located on University Green. Shafer Tower is the focal point of the new quadrangle. Located in the median of McKinley Avenue, Shafer Tower is a 150-foot-tall (46?m) free-standing bell tower with a 48-bell carillon.[24] McKinley Avenue, which runs north-south through campus, acts as a spine or axis of activity connecting the two main quadrangles. The Scramble Light at the intersection of Riverside and McKinley is a pedestrian scramble that halts vehicular traffic in 30-second sequences, allowing pedestrians to cross the intersection in every direction, including diagonally.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of Ball State University's athletic facilities and intramural fields are located on the northernmost portion of campus near the intersection of McGalliard Road and Tillotson Avenue. These include First Merchants Ballpark Complex (Ball Diamond and Softball Field), Briner Sports Complex, Fisher Football Training Complex, and the 22,500-seat Scheumann Stadium, home to Ball State Cardinals football. The 11,500-seat John E. Worthen Arena anchors the central campus athletic facilities, including the Field Sports Building, the Health and Physical Activity Building, Lewellen Aquatic Center, and the Jo Ann Gora Student Recreation and Wellness Center. Other facilities include the Cardinal Creek Tennis Center and Lucina Tennis Courts.  In January 2018, the Earl Yestingsmeier Golf Practice Facility opened after a year of construction.  The 6400 square foot facility features a state of the art 20' x 20' digital simulator.\\r\\n\\r\\nYork Prairie Creek, also known as Cardinal Creek, begins at the pond outside Park Hall on campus, winding northwest connecting to the Duck Pond before heading west toward the White River. The university's campus includes nearly 8,000 trees of about 625 species.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university provides a free shuttle service during the fall and spring semesters. Shuttles run on red, green, and blue loops every five to ten minutes, Monday through Thursday, from 7:15 am to 11:00 pm (7:15 am to 8:00 pm on Fridays), and every ten to 15 minutes on Sundays from 5:00 pm to 11:00 pm.[27] Muncie Indiana Transit System (MITS) also provides free bus service to students on local routes, particularly on Routes 1, 2, 14, and 16 which run through campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost campus facilities feature red or brown brick fa?ades with the exceptions of Elliott and Pruis Halls, each made of Indiana limestone. Completed in 1899 as the university's first building, the Frank A. Bracken Administration Building was built in Neoclassical style with a yellow brick fa?ade.[28] Most campus facilities built prior to 1960 feature Collegiate Gothic architecture, including Ball Gymnasium, Burris Laboratory School, Fine Arts Building, and L. A. Pittenger Student Center.[28] Other examples include Burkhardt Building, North Quad Building, and Lucina Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral modern campus buildings (early-1960s to early-1980s) have been built in Brutalist architecture, embracing blank walls and exposed concrete. Examples of this style include the Architecture Building, Bracken Library, and Whitinger Business Building. The Teachers College Building, built in 1968, is the tallest building on campus, at 10 floors and 138 feet (42?m).[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent building additions and expansions (early-1990s to present) have shied away from Brutalist designs, and instead, have been built to respect the scale and style of the university's older Collegiate Gothic buildings. While red and brown brick accented by limestone have remained the favored fa?ade materials, large windows have become more commonplace in buildings constructed since the late-1990s to emphasize natural lighting. Examples of this architecture include the Alumni Center, Art and Journalism Building, Music Instruction Building, and the David Letterman Communication and Media Building.\\r\\n\\r\\nBall State has adopted environmental sustainability as a primary component to the university's strategic plan and vision.[16] Starting in the mid-2000s, all building additions and renovations are designed to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification standards. Standards include environmentally-friendly site selection, energy and water efficiency, materials selection, and indoor environmental quality, among others.[17] The university diverts 20 percent of its waste from landfills through recycling efforts[30] and also invests in hybrid vehicles, hybrid-electric shuttle buses, and vehicles that use E85.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Spring 2009 Commencement, then-president Jo Ann Gora announced Ball State's plan for the largest geothermal energy project of its kind in the United States.[18] Ball State has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 80,000 tons annually through the installation of a $65 million geothermal heating and cooling system and the closing of all four coal-fired boilers on campus. The move is expected to save the university $2 million in fuel costs annually. The geothermal system will consist of 4,000 boreholes and two energy stations on campus.[32] The system will consist of two underground loops to circulate water for heating and cooling throughout campus.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2007, six campus buildings have achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification. The Marilyn K. Glick Center for Glass is considered LEED certified.

Today, Frog Baby is situated in a fountain on University Green. Since its move and restoration, students have started a new tradition of dressing the statue to reflect weather patterns (scarves and hats in the winter)[87] or current university events (jerseys and helmets for upcoming football games). Despite 24/7 surveillance, the statue has been a repeated target of vandals.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 1926, Homecoming has brought several traditions.[89] Homecoming Parade was first held in 1939.

Over 60 million people were killed, which was about 3% of the 1940 world population (est. 2.3 billion).[1] The tables below give a detailed country-by-country count of human losses. World War II fatality statistics vary, with estimates of total deaths ranging from 50 million to more than 80 million.[2] The higher figure of over 80 million includes deaths from war-related disease and famine. Civilians killed totalled 50 to 55 million, including 19 to 28 million from war-related disease and famine. Military deaths from all causes totalled 21 to 25 million, including deaths in captivity of about 5 million prisoners of war.\\r\\nRecent historical scholarship has shed new light on the topic of Second World War casualties. Research in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union has caused a revision of estimates of Soviet WW2 fatalities.[3] According to Russian government figures, USSR losses within postwar borders now stand at 26.6 million.[4][5] including 8.5 million due to war related famine and disease[6] In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated Poland's dead at between 5.6 and 5.8 million.[7] Historian Rdiger Overmans of the Military History Research Office (Germany) published a study in 2000 that estimated the German military dead and missing at 5.3 million, including 900,000 men conscripted from outside of Germany's 1937 borders, in Austria, and in east-central Europe.[8][9][10] The People's Republic of China puts its war dead at 20 million,[11] while the Japanese government puts its casualties due to the war at 3.1 million.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCompiling or estimating the numbers of deaths caused during wars and other violent conflicts is a controversial subject. Historians often put forward many different estimates of the numbers killed during World War II.[13] The authors of the Oxford Companion to World War II maintain that \\"casualty statistics are notoriously unreliable.\\"[14] The table below gives data on the number of dead for each country, along with population information to show the relative impact of losses. When scholarly sources differ on the number of deaths in a country, a range of war losses is given, in order to inform readers that the death toll is disputed. Since casualty statistics are sometimes disputed the footnotes to this article present the different estimates by official governmental sources as well as historians. Military figures include battle deaths (KIA) and personnel missing in action (MIA), as well as fatalities due to accidents, disease and deaths of prisoners of war in captivity. Civilian casualties include deaths caused by strategic bombing, Holocaust victims, German war crimes, Japanese war crimes, population transfers in the Soviet Union, Allied war crimes, and deaths due to war related famine and disease.\\r\\nThe sources for the casualties of the individual nations do not use the same methods, and civilian deaths due to starvation and disease are not given for Japan, Germany and several other highly stressed populations. The losses listed here are actual deaths; hypothetical losses due to a decline in births are not included with the total dead. The distinction between military and civilian casualties caused directly by warfare and collateral damage is not always clear-cut. For nations that suffered huge losses such as the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Germany, and Yugoslavia, sources can give only the total estimated population loss caused by the war and a rough estimate of the breakdown of deaths caused by military activity, crimes against humanity and war-related famine. The casualties listed here include 19 to 25 million war-related famine deaths in the USSR, China, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, India that are often omitted from other compilations of World War II casualties.[15][16] The footnotes give a detailed breakdown of the casualties and their sources, including data on the number of wounded where reliable sources are available.\\r\\nThe estimated breakdown for each Soviet republic of total war dead[13]^AY4\\r\\nThe source of the figures is Vadim Erlikman.

Erlikman, a Russian historian, notes that these figures are his estimates.\\r\\nIncluded in the figures of total war dead for each nation are victims of the Holocaust.\\r\\nThe Holocaust is the term generally used to describe the genocide of approximately six million European Jews during World War II. Martin Gilbert estimates 5.7 million (78%) of the 7.3 million Jews in German occupied Europe were Holocaust victims.[199] Estimates of Holocaust deaths range between 4.9 and 5.9 million Jews.[200]\\r\\nStatistical breakdown of Jewish dead:\\r\\nThe figures for the pre-war Jewish population and deaths in the table below are from The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust.[200] The low, high and average percentage figures for deaths of the pre-war population have been added.\\r\\nSome scholars maintain that the definition of the Holocaust should also include the other victims persecuted and killed by the Nazis.[212][213]\\r\\nThe following figures are from The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust, the authors maintain that \\"statistics on Gypsy losses are especially unreliable and controversial. These figures (cited below) are based on necessarily rough estimates\\".[224]\\r\\nIncluded with total war dead are victims of Japanese war crimes.\\r\\nThe total war dead in the USSR includes victims of Soviet oppression. The number of deaths in the Gulag labor camps increased as a result of wartime overcrowding and food shortages.[257] The Stalin regime deported the entire populations of ethnic minorities considered to be potentially disloyal.[258] Since 1990 Russian scholars have been given access to the Soviet-era archives and have published data on the numbers of people executed and those who died in Gulag labor camps and prisons.[259] The Russian scholar Viktor Zemskov puts the death toll from 1941ÿ1945 at about 1 million based on data from the Soviet archives.[260] The Soviet-era archive figures on the Gulag labor camps has been the subject of a vigorous academic debate outside Russia since their publication in 1991. J. Arch Getty and Stephen G. Wheatcroft maintain that Soviet-era figures more accurately detail the victims of the Gulag labor camp system in the Stalin era.[261][262] Robert Conquest and Steven Rosefielde have disputed the accuracy of the data from the Soviet archives, maintaining that the demographic data and testimonials by survivors of the Gulag labor camps indicate a higher death toll.[263][264] Rosefielde posits that the release of the Soviet Archive figures is disinformation generated by the modern KGB.[265] Rosefielde maintains that the data from the Soviet archives is incomplete; for example, he pointed out that the figures do not include the 22,000 victims of the Katyn massacre.[266] Rosefielde's demographic analysis puts the number of excess deaths due to Soviet repression at 2,183,000 in 1939ÿ40 and 5,458,000 from 1941ÿ1945.[267] Michael Haynes and Rumy Husun accept the figures from the Soviet archives as being an accurate tally of Stalin's victims, they maintain that the demographic data depicts an underdeveloped Soviet economy and the losses in World War Two rather than indicating a higher death toll in the Gulag labor camps.[268]\\r\\nIn August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated 150,000 Polish citizens were killed due to Soviet repression. Since the collapse of the USSR, Polish scholars have been able to do research in the Soviet archives on Polish losses during the Soviet occupation.[197] Andrzej Paczkowski puts the number of Polish deaths at 90,000ÿ100,000 of the 1.0 million persons deported and 30,000 executed by the Soviets.[269] In 2005 Tadeusz Piotrowski estimated the death toll in Soviet hands at 350,000.[270]\\r\\nThe Estonian State Commission for the Examination of Repressive Policies Carried out During the Occupations put civilian deaths due to the Soviet occupation in 1940ÿ1941 at 33,900 including (7,800 deaths) of arrested people, (6,000) deportee deaths, (5,000) evacuee deaths, (1,100) people gone missing and (14,000) conscripted for forced labor.

The exact number of dead and injured will never be known because of the confusion after the explosions. Persons unaccounted for might have been burned beyond recognition in the falling buildings, disposed of in one of the mass cremations of the first week of recovery, or driven out of the city to die or recover without any record remaining. No sure count of even the prepaid populations existed. Because of the decline in activity in the two port cities, the constant threat of incendiary raids, and the formal evacuation programs of the Government, an unknown number of the inhabitants had either drifter away from the cities or been removed according to plan. In this uncertain situation, estimates of casualties have generally ranged between 100,000 and 180,000 for Hiroshima, and between 50,000 and 100,000 for Nagasaki. The Survey believes the dead at Hiroshima to have been between 70,000 and 80,000, with an equal number injured; at Nagasaki over 35,000 dead and somewhat more than that injured seems the most plausible estimate.

The book is a frame narrative primarily depicting a fictional island society and its religious, social and political customs. Many aspects of More's description of Utopia are reminiscent of life in monasteries.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title De optimo rei publicae statu deque nova insula Utopia literally translates, \\"Of a republic's best state and of the new island Utopia\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is variously rendered as any of the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original name was even longer: Libellus vere aureus, nec minus salutaris quam festivus, de optimo rei publicae statu deque nova insula Utopia. This translates, \\"A truly golden little book, no less beneficial than entertaining, of a republic's best state and of the new island Utopia\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Utopia\\" is derived from the Greek prefix \\"ou-\\" (?), meaning \\"not\\", and topos (??), \\"place\\", with the suffix -i (-?ϫ) that is typical of toponyms; hence the name literally means \\"nowhere\\", emphasizing its fictionality.  In early modern English, Utopia was spelled \\"Utopie\\", which is today rendered Utopy in some editions.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nA common misunderstanding has that \\"Utopia\\" is derived from eu- (e?), \\"good\\", and \\"topos\\", such that it would literally translate as \\"good place\\".[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn English, Utopia is pronounced exactly as Eutopia (the latter word, in Greek ??ϫ [Eutopi], meaning good place, contains the prefix ?- [eu-], \\"good\\", with which the ? of Utopia has come to be confused in the English pronunciation).[4] This is something that More himself addresses in an addendum to his book  Wherfore not Utopie, but rather rightely my name is Eutopie, a place of felicitie.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first edition contained a woodcut map of the island of Utopia, the Utopian alphabet, verses by Pieter Gillis, Gerard Geldenhouwer, and Cornelius Grapheus, and Thomas More's epistle dedicating the work to Gillis.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work begins with written correspondence between Thomas More and several people he had met on the continent: Peter Gilles, town clerk of Antwerp, and Hieronymus van Busleyden, counselor to Charles V. More chose these letters, which are communications between actual people, to further the plausibility of his fictional land. In the same spirit, these letters also include a specimen of the Utopian alphabet and its poetry. The letters also explain the lack of widespread travel to Utopia; during the first mention of the land, someone had coughed during announcement of the exact longitude and latitude. The first book tells of the traveller Raphael Hythlodaeus, to whom More is introduced in Antwerp, and it also explores the subject of how best to counsel a prince, a popular topic at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first discussions with Raphael allow him to discuss some of the modern ills affecting Europe such as the tendency of kings to start wars and the subsequent loss of money on fruitless endeavours. He also criticises the use of execution to punish theft, saying thieves might as well murder whom they rob, to remove witnesses, if the punishment is going to be the same. He lays most of the problems of theft on the practice of enclosurethe enclosing of common landand the subsequent poverty and starvation of people who are denied access to land because of sheep farming.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore tries to convince Raphael that he could find a good job in a royal court, advising monarchs, but Raphael says that his views are too radical and wouldn't be listened to. Raphael sees himself in the tradition of Plato: he knows that for good governance, kings must act philosophically. He, however, points out that:\\r\\n\\r\\nMore seems to contemplate the duty of philosophers to work around and in real situations and, for the sake of political expediency, work within flawed systems to make them better, rather than hoping to start again from first principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nUtopia is placed in the New World and More links Raphael's travels in with Amerigo Vespucci's real life voyages of discovery. He suggests that Raphael is one of the 24 men Vespucci, in his Four Voyages of 1507, says he left for six months at Cabo Frio, Brazil. Raphael then travels further and finds the island of Utopia, where he spends five years observing the customs of the natives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to More, the island of Utopia is \\r\\n\\r\\nThe island was originally a peninsula but a 15-mile wide channel was dug by the community's founder King Utopos to separate it from the mainland. The island contains 54 cities. Each city is divided into four equal parts. The capital city, Amaurot, is located directly in the middle of the crescent island.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach city has not more 6000 households, each family consisting of between 10 and 16 adults. Thirty households are grouped together and elect a Syphograntus (whom More says is now called a phylarchus). Every ten Syphogranti have an elected Traniborus (more recently called a protophylarchus) ruling over them. The 200 Syphogranti of a city elect a Prince in a secret ballot. The Prince stays for life unless he is deposed or removed for suspicion of tyranny.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople are re-distributed around the households and towns to keep numbers even. If the island suffers from overpopulation, colonies are set up on the mainland. Alternatively, the natives of the mainland are invited to be part of these Utopian colonies, but if they dislike them and no longer wish to stay they may return. In the case of under-population the colonists are re-called.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no private property on Utopia, with goods being stored in warehouses and people requesting what they need. There are also no locks on the doors of the houses, and the houses are rotated between the citizens every ten years. Agriculture provides the most important occupation on the island. Every person is taught it and must live in the countryside, farming for two years at a time, with women doing the same work as men. Parallel to this, every citizen must learn at least one of the other essential trades: weaving (mainly done by the women), carpentry, metalsmithing and masonry. There is deliberate simplicity about these trades; for instance, all people wear the same types of simple clothes and there are no dressmakers making fine apparel. All able-bodied citizens must work; thus unemployment is eradicated, and the length of the working day can be minimised: the people only have to work six hours a day (although many willingly work for longer). More does allow scholars in his society to become the ruling officials or priests, people picked during their primary education for their ability to learn. All other citizens, however, are encouraged to apply themselves to learning in their leisure time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlavery is a feature of Utopian life and it is reported that every household has two slaves. The slaves are either from other countries or are the Utopian criminals. These criminals are weighed down with chains made out of gold. The gold is part of the community wealth of the country, and fettering criminals with it or using it for shameful things like chamber pots gives the citizens a healthy dislike of it. It also makes it difficult to steal as it is in plain view. The wealth, though, is of little importance and is only good for buying commodities from foreign nations or bribing these nations to fight each other. Slaves are periodically released for good behaviour. Jewels are worn by children, who finally give them up as they mature.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther significant innovations of Utopia include: a welfare state with free hospitals, euthanasia permissible by the state, priests being allowed to marry, divorce permitted, premarital sex punished by a lifetime of enforced celibacy and adultery being punished by enslavement. Meals are taken in community dining halls and the job of feeding the population is given to a different household in turn. Although all are fed the same, Raphael explains that the old and the administrators are given the best of the food. Travel on the island is only permitted with an internal passport and any people found without a passport are, on a first occasion, returned in disgrace, but after a second offence they are placed in slavery. In addition, there are no lawyers and the law is made deliberately simple, as all should understand it and not leave people in any doubt of what is right and wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several religions on the island: moon-worshipers, sun-worshipers, planet-worshipers, ancestor-worshipers and monotheists, but each is tolerant of the others. Only atheists are despised (but allowed) in Utopia, as they are seen as representing a danger to the state: since they do not believe in any punishment or reward after this life, they have no reason to share the communistic life of Utopia, and will break the laws for their own gain. They are not banished, but are encouraged to talk out their erroneous beliefs with the priests until they are convinced of their error. Raphael says that through his teachings Christianity was beginning to take hold in Utopia. The toleration of all other religious ideas is enshrined in a universal prayer all the Utopians recite.\\r\\n\\r\\nWives are subject to their husbands and husbands are subject to their wives although women are restricted to conducting household tasks for the most part. Only few widowed women become priests. While all are trained in military arts, women confess their sins to their husbands once a month. Gambling, hunting, makeup and astrology are all discouraged in Utopia. The role allocated to women in Utopia might, however, have been seen as being more liberal from a contemporary point of view.\\r\\n\\r\\nUtopians do not like to engage in war. If they feel countries friendly to them have been wronged, they will send military aid, but they try to capture, rather than kill, enemies. They are upset if they achieve victory through bloodshed. The main purpose of war is to achieve that which, if they had achieved already, they would not have gone to war over.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivacy is not regarded as freedom in Utopia; taverns, ale-houses and places for private gatherings are non-existent for the effect of keeping all men in full view, so that they are obliged to behave well.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most troublesome questions about Utopia is Thomas More's reason for writing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost scholars see it as a comment on or criticism of 16th century Catholicism, for the evils of More's day are laid out in Book I and in many ways apparently solved in Book II.[8] Indeed, Utopia has many of the characteristics of satire, and there are many jokes and satirical asides such as how honest people are in Europe, but these are usually contrasted with the simple, uncomplicated society of the Utopians.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, the puzzle is that some of the practices and institutions of the Utopians, such as the ease of divorce, euthanasia and both married priests and female priests, seem to be polar opposites of More's beliefs and the teachings of the Catholic Church of which he was a devout member. Another often cited apparent contradiction is that of the religious tolerance of Utopia contrasted with his persecution of Protestants as Lord Chancellor. Similarly, the criticism of lawyers comes from a writer who, as Lord Chancellor, was arguably the most influential lawyer in England. It can be answered, however, that as a pagan society Utopians had the best ethics that could be reached through reason alone, or that More changed from his early life to his later when he was Lord Chancellor.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne highly influential interpretation of Utopia is that of intellectual historian Quentin Skinner.[9] He has argued that More was taking part in the Renaissance humanist debate over true nobility, and that he was writing to prove the perfect commonwealth could not occur with private property. Crucially, Skinner sees Raphael Hythlodaeus as embodying the Platonic view that philosophers should not get involved in politics, while the character of More embodies the more pragmatic Ciceronian view. Thus the society Raphael proposes is the ideal More would want. But without communism, which he saw no possibility of occurring, it was wiser to take a more pragmatic view.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuentin Skinner's interpretation of Utopia is consistent with the speculation that Stephen Greenblatt made in The Swerve: How the World Became Modern. There, Greenblatt argued that More was under the Epicurean influence of Lucretius's On the Nature of Things and the people that live in Utopia were an example of how pleasure has become their guiding principle of life.[10] Although Greenblatt acknowledged that More's insistence on the existence of an afterlife and punishment for people holding contrary views were inconsistent with the essentially materialist view of Epicureanism, Greenblatt contended that it was the minimum conditions for what the pious More would have considered as necessary to live a happy life.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother complication comes from the Greek meaning of the names of people and places in the work. Apart from Utopia, meaning \\"Noplace,\\" several other lands are mentioned: Achora meaning \\"Nolandia\\", Polyleritae meaning \\"Muchnonsense\\", Macarenses meaning \\"Happiland,\\" and the river Anydrus meaning \\"Nowater\\". Raphael's last name, Hythlodaeus means \\"dispenser of nonsense\\" surely implying that the whole of the Utopian text is 'nonsense'. Additionally the Latin rendering of More's name, Morus, is similar to the word for a fool in Greek (??). It is unclear whether More is simply being ironic, an in-joke for those who know Greek, seeing as the place he is talking about does not actually exist or whether there is actually a sense of distancing of Hythlodaeus' and the More's (\\"Morus\\") views in the text from his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Raphael, though, may have been chosen by More to remind his readers of the archangel Raphael who is mentioned in the Book of Tobit (3:17; 5:4, 16; 6:11, 14, 16, 18; also in chs. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12). In that book the angel guides Tobias and later cures his father of his blindness. While Hythlodaeus may suggest his words are not to be trusted, Raphael meaning (in Hebrew) \\"God has healed\\" suggests that Raphael may be opening the eyes of the reader to what is true. The suggestion that More may have agreed with the views of Raphael is given weight by the way he dressed; with \\"his cloak... hanging carelessly about him\\"; a style which Roger Ascham reports that More himself was wont to adopt. Furthermore, more recent criticism has questioned the reliability of both Gile's annotations and the character of \\"More\\" in the text itself. Claims that the book only subverts Utopia and Hythlodaeus are possibly oversimplistic.\\r\\n\\r\\nUtopia was begun while More was an envoy in the Low Countries in May 1515. More started by writing the introduction and the description of the society which would become the second half of the work and on his return to England he wrote the \\"dialogue of counsel\\", completing the work in 1516. In the same year, it was printed in Leuven under Erasmus's editorship and after revisions by More it was printed in Basel in November 1518. It was not until 1551, sixteen years after More's execution, that it was first published in England as an English translation by Ralph Robinson. Gilbert Burnet's translation of 1684 is probably the most commonly cited version.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work seems to have been popular, if misunderstood: the introduction of More's Epigrams of 1518 mentions a man who did not regard More as a good writer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eponymous title Utopia has since eclipsed More's original story and the term is now commonly used to describe an idyllic, imaginary society. Although he may not have directly founded the contemporary notion of what has since become known as Utopian and dystopian fiction, More certainly popularised the idea of imagined parallel realities, and some of the early works which owe a debt to Utopia must include The City of the Sun by Tommaso Campanella, Description of the Republic of Christianopolis by Johannes Valentinus Andreae, New Atlantis by Francis Bacon and Candide by Voltaire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe politics of Utopia have been seen as influential to the ideas of Anabaptism and communism.[citation needed] While utopian socialism was used to describe the first concepts of socialism, later Marxist theorists tended to see the ideas as too simplistic and not grounded on realistic principles. The religious message in the work and its uncertain, possibly satiric, tone has also alienated some theorists from the work.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn applied example of More's Utopia can be seen in Vasco de Quiroga's implemented society in Michoacn, Mexico, which was directly inspired by More's work.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the opening scene in the film A Man for all Seasons, Utopia is referenced in a conversation. The alleged amorality of England's priests is compared to that of the more highly principled behaviour of the fictional priests in More's Utopia, when a character observes wryly that \\"every second person born in England is fathered by a priest.\\"","input":"What was described in the renaissance publication utopia?"},{"output":"Ed Lee","context":"The Mayor of the City and County of San Francisco is the head of the executive branch of the San Francisco city and county government. The mayor has the duty to enforce city laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, the legislative branch. The mayor serves a four-year term and is limited to two successive terms.[1] Because of San Francisco's status as a consolidated city-county, the mayor also serves as the head of government of the county; both entities have been governed together by a combined set of governing bodies since 1856.[2]\\r\\nThere have been 42 individuals sworn into office. John W. Geary, elected in 1850, was the first mayor of the city. Charles James Brenham, who served as mayor during the 1850s, is the only person who has served two non-consecutive terms. The previous mayor, Gavin Newsom resigned to become the Lieutenant Governor of California on January 10, 2011. Ed Lee was appointed by the Board of Supervisors on the following day to finish out Newsom's term. Lee was elected to his own term on November 8, 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mayor of San Francisco is elected every four years; elections take place one year before United States presidential elections on election day in November. Candidates must live and be registered to vote in San Francisco at the time of the election. The mayor is usually sworn in on the January 8 following the election. The next election for the mayor will be in 2019.\\r\\nUnder the California constitution, all city elections in the state are conducted on a non-partisan basis. As a result, candidates' party affiliations are not listed on the ballot, and multiple candidates from a single party can run in the election since a primary election is not held.[3]\\r\\nMayoral elections were originally run under a two-round system. If no candidate received a simple majority of votes in the general election, the two candidates who received the most votes competed in a second runoff election held several weeks later.[4] In 2002, the election system for city officials was overhauled as a result of a citywide referendum. The new system, known as instant-runoff voting, allows voters to select and rank three candidates based on their preferences. If no one wins more than half of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and second-choice votes (and third-choice votes, if necessary) are counted until a candidate captures the majority. This eliminates the need to hold a separate runoff election and saves money. This was first implemented in the 2004 Board of Supervisors election after two years of preparation.[5] In 2007, the new system was implemented in the mayoral election for the first time.[6]\\r\\nAs of January 2017, the mayor is paid an annual salary of $297,386.84\\r\\nThe mayor has the responsibility to enforce all city laws, administer and coordinate city departments and intergovernmental activities, set forth policies and agendas to the Board of Supervisors, and prepare and submit the city budget at the end of each fiscal year. The mayor has the powers to either approve or veto bills passed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, participate in meetings of the Board of Supervisors and its committees, appoint a replacement to fill vacancies in all city elected offices until elections, appoint a member of the Board as acting mayor in his/her absence, and to direct personnels in the case of emergency.[1]\\r\\nIf the mayor dies in office, resigns, or is unable to carry out his/her duties and he/she did not designate an acting mayor, the president of the Board of Supervisors becomes acting mayor until the full Board select a person to fill the vacancy and finish the previous mayoral term.[7] (In the case that both the president of the Board of Supervisors and the mayor are incapacitated, the order of succession is followed.[1]) This has happened six times: James Otis died in office and was succeeded by George Hewston,[a] Eugene Schmitz was removed and succeeded by Charles Boxton,[b] Charles Boxton resigned and was succeeded by Edward Robeson Taylor,[b] James Rolph resigned and was succeeded by Angelo Rossi,[c] George Moscone was assassinated and was succeeded by Dianne Feinstein,[d] and Gavin Newsom resigned and was succeeded by Ed Lee.[e]\\r\\nTo date, 42 individuals have served as mayor. There have been 43 mayoralties due to Charles James Brenham's serving two non-consecutive terms: he is counted chronologically as both the second and fourth mayor. The longest term was that of James Rolph, who served over 18 years until his resignation to become the California governor. The length of his tenure as mayor was largely due to his popularity. During his term, San Francisco saw the expansion of its transit system, the construction of the Civic Center and the hosting of the World's Fair.[8][9] The shortest term was that of Charles Boxton, who served only eight days before resigning from office. Two mayors have died in office: Otis died from illness and Moscone was assassinated. Dianne Feinstein is the only woman, Willie Brown is the only African American, and Ed Lee is the only Asian American to have served as mayor.\\r\\nEleven mayors are native San Franciscans: Levi Richard Ellert, James D. Phelan, Eugene Schmitz, James Rolph, Elmer Robinson, John F. Shelley, Joseph Alioto, George Moscone, Dianne Feinstein, Frank Jordan and Gavin Newsom. Four mayors are foreign-born: Frank McCoppin and P. H. McCarthy (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, present-day Republic of Ireland), Adolph Sutro (Prussia, present-day Germany) and George Christopher (Greece).\\r\\nThis list does not include all acting mayors, of which there have been many, as an acting mayor is typically appointed by the mayor whenever he or she will be out of the city.\\r\\nThe following is a list of congressional, gubernatorial and other offices held by mayors, before or after their term(s).\\r\\nAs of February 2014, five former mayors are alive, the oldest being Dianne Feinstein (1978ÿ1988; born 1933). The most recent mayor to die is George Christopher (1956ÿ1964; born 1907), on September 14, 2000.","input":"Who is the mayor of san francisco california?"},{"output":"Fireflies","context":"Owl City is an American electronica project created in 2007 in Owatonna, Minnesota; it is one of several projects by singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Adam Young. Young created the project while experimenting with music in his parents' basement. Owl City developed a following on the social networking site MySpace, like many musicians who achieved success in the late 2000s, before signing with Universal Republic Records, now Republic Records, in 2008.\\r\\nAfter two independent releases, Owl City gained mainstream popularity with the 2009 major label debut album Ocean Eyes, which includes the six-time Platinum single \\"Fireflies\\". The album was certified Platinum in the United States in April 2010.\\r\\nIn June 2011, Owl City released its third studio album, All Things Bright and Beautiful, which was followed by The Midsummer Station in August 2012. Owl City has recorded songs for several animated films, including Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole, Wreck-It Ralph, The Croods and The Smurfs 2.[2] Owl City also has released several charting singles, most notably \\"Good Time\\" and \\"Fireflies\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdam Randal Young (Born on July 5, 1986) is Owl City's founder and only constant member. He was born in Ottumwa, Iowa and raised in Owatonna, Minnesota,[3] where he graduated from Owatonna Senior High School and then found work at a Coca-Cola shipping warehouse.[4][5] He began composing melodies in his head while working, which he would then record in his studio in his parents' basement.[6][7]\\r\\nYoung is a devout Christian and stated that his faith is the only thing more important to him than music.[8] He has described himself as introverted and believes he has symptoms of Asperger syndrome; however, it hasn't been diagnosed.[9] This has morphed into a general belief that he does have it.[10][11][12][13]\\r\\nSuffering from insomnia while working loading Coca-Cola trucks, Adam Young began to compose music,[14][15][16] recording with a C-1 Behringer Microphone. Among the software that he began with was Reason from Propellerhead.[17][18] He began uploading songs recorded in his parents' basement to Myspace.[16][19] He started to receive favorable attention for his music and then helped cultivate this nascent fanbase by being an open and accessible web presence, responding to any messages he received and constantly posting blogs.[20] His manager Steve Bursky later highlighted the significance of Young's engaging online manner in building his following saying: \\"People feel like they know him, like they've got a direct connection to him because of how he approaches his connection with them online.\\"[20] Through a deal with the digital aggregator CD Baby, he then started making the songs available for sale through iTunes.[20] In 2007, Owl City released an EP titled Of June, followed by the 2008 release of the album Maybe I'm Dreaming. Of June reached No.?15 on the Billboard Electronic Albums chart, and Maybe I'm Dreaming peaked on the same chart at No.?13.[21]\\r\\nThe viral phenomenon that was building through Myspace caught the attention of Universal Republic presidents Avery and Monte Lipman who approached Young with a view to signing the artist.[20] Republic recommended Young partner up with 27-year-old manager Steve Bursky of Foundations Artist Management and the two began working together in late 2008. When later asked by HitQuarters why the label chose him for a major label act given his relative inexperience, Bursky said:\\r\\n\\"I think they saw Owl City as representing the future of our business. This idea of a kid in a tiny town in rural U.S. being able to make songs in his basement that sound like Top 40 radio could never have happened ten years ago. By hiring a young management company who understands the business circa 2011 over a seasoned industry vet, who might not understand the online spaces well, showed a lot of understanding of where this kid was going to end up having success.\\"[20]\\r\\nOwl City's label deal with Universal Republic was finally confirmed in February 2009.[22] According to Bursky there was initially some disagreement about the direction Owl City should follow, telling HitQuarters: \\"They were ready to send him into the studio with big producers and polish him up to try to become this thing that he wasn't. But we put our foot down and said, 'Look, the reason you signed this kid is because it's working. Whatever it is about himhis music, his interaction with his fans, his brilliance in the online spacethese things are connecting with people, and as soon as you change that you lose what's special about this artist.' To their credit, they really listened and they got it.\\"[20]\\r\\nOcean Eyes, Owl City's major label debut, was released on iTunes on July 14, 2009, with the physical release following on July 28, 2009. The album debuted at No.?27 on the Billboard 200. Owl City released three singles from this album: \\"Umbrella Beach\\", \\"Vanilla Twilight\\" and \\"Fireflies\\".[23] \\"Fireflies\\" topped the US and Canadian charts. Ocean Eyes reached the top ten on the US album charts, topped the US electronic charts, and also reached Amazon MP3's top 10 most downloaded album list. By April 2010, it was certified Platinum in the United States.[24] On January 24, 2010, Owl City reached the No.?1 spot in the UK Top 40 Singles chart with \\"Fireflies\\". The song \\"Tidal Wave\\" also received significant airplay on Christian music radio stations.[25] On January 2, 2011, it was revealed \\"Fireflies\\" was the 20th most downloaded song of all time in the UK.[26]\\r\\nYoung was joined by Breanne Dren on several tracks; the most notable example of which is \\"The Saltwater Room\\". Owl City's live band consists of Breanne Dren (background vocals/keyboards), Matthew Decker (drums), Laura Musten (violin), Hannah Schroeder (cello), and Daniel Jorgensen (vibes).[27][28] Relient K vocalist Matt Thiessen has toured and collaborated with Owl City on several tracks, including \\"Fireflies\\", where Thiessen can be heard providing the backup vocals.

Prior to the July 14, 2009, Internet release of Ocean Eyes, and the \\"Fireflies\\" single, Steve Hoover was hired as a director for a music video for \\"Fireflies\\". The video was to have had an exclusive premiere on MySpace,[29] but had been leaked onto YouTube and Dailymotion hours earlier. \\"Fireflies\\" became a big sleeper hit, topping the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States for the week ending November 7, 2009.[30]\\r\\nOwl City is featured on Soundtrack 90210 with the song, \\"Sunburn\\", which was released on October 13, 2009.[31] Owl City has toured with The Scene Aesthetic, Lights, John Mayer, Maroon 5 and Brooke Waggoner. He was also guest featured in the soundtrack to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland with a song, \\"The Technicolor Phase\\", that had already been featured in his debut album.[32]\\r\\nIn 2010, Young revealed a new musical project known as Sky Sailing, which moved away from his usual electronica genre of music and introduced acoustic guitar and piano accompaniments into his work. The unrefined tracks were recorded in the summer of 2006 before he began making music as Owl City.[33] His first album under this new project is entitled An Airplane Carried Me to Bed, and was released July 13, 2010, via iTunes.[34]\\r\\nIn May 2010, Young collaborated with high-profile British electronic composer, producer, musician, and songwriter Nick Bracegirdle. Under his Chicane alias, Bracegirdle released the single \\"Middledistancerunner\\" on August 1, 2010, featuring Adam Young on vocals. This is the first single from the fourth Chicane album Giants. He also worked with famed Dutch producer Armin van Buuren, appearing on a track called 'Youtopia' from the van Buuren album Mirage. In September, \\"To the Sky\\" was officially released via iTunes on the soundtrack for Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'hoole. On October 25, 2010, Young released a cover version of the praise and worship song \\"In Christ Alone\\" as a streaming MP3 on his website.[35]\\r\\nIn November 2010, a new album called Flight was released on iTunes for one of his other musical projects, Windsor Airlift.[36] A new Christmas single called \\"Peppermint Winter\\" was also released during that month.\\r\\nProduction on Young's third studio album began around mid-2010, with Young being announced as the executive producer of the album.[37][38] On October 18, Young wrote an entry on his blog regarding his third studio album, saying that the album was nearing completion.[39]\\r\\nIn February 2011, the title of the album was announced to be All Things Bright and Beautiful and that the album would be released on May 17. However, on April 6, Young released a statement on his website, along with lengthy previews of four of his songs (Dreams Don't Turn to Dust, Alligator Sky Featuring Shawn Chrystopher, Galaxies, and Deer in the Headlights), that the release date for All Things Bright and Beautiful would be pushed back to June 14.[40][41]\\r\\n\\"Alligator Sky\\" was released as the lead single from the album on iTunes. Later that month and in early April, tickets went on sale for the All Things Bright and Beautiful World Tour,[42][43][44] and All Things Bright and Beautiful became available for preorder.[45] The song, \\"Galaxies\\" would be released as the second single from the album.\\r\\nThe music video for \\"Alligator Sky\\" would be released on May 6. Young discussed the concept in a making-of video posted on Owl City's VEVO account, \\"The concept is basically about these two guys who are leaving Earth. Rather than it being this very dark post-apocalyptic vibe, it's very optimistic, and so it's like people are excited to leave earth.\\"[46]\\r\\n\\"Deer in the Headlights\\", the third single from the album, was released on iTunes on May 23. In June of that year, All Things Bright and Beautiful was released on iTunes. Although only a few days prior on May 20, almost all of the album leaked onto the Internet.[47] The music video for \\"Deer in the Headlights\\" was released. It features Young driving through the night in a replica of the DMC DeLorean featured from the Back to the Future trilogy.[48] Canadian musician Lights also makes a cameo appearance during the video.\\r\\n\\"Lonely Lullaby\\" was released as a single on iTunes, which was previously available only to Owl City Galaxy members, on July 19. Young was interviewed in the August issue of Clich Magazine. He also appeared on the cover of the magazine and the issue also featured some of Young's very own artwork. Later during the month of July at the Club Nokia concert in Los Angeles, Young announced that the concert was being filmed for a Live DVD. The recording was eventually released on iTunes in November 2011.[49]\\r\\nOn November 15, 2011, Jumeirah released a commercial for their famous Burj Al Arab luxury hotel.[50] Young was called upon to compose the music for the commercial.\\r\\nIn Young's final tour dates of 2011, he performed a new song entitled \\"I Hope You Think of Me\\".[51] On January 2, 2012, Young wrote an entry on his blog regarding his fourth full-length album. Young said that he would be collaborating with more producers and songwriters, saying that his new record \\"Marks a flying leap in this direction\\". Young expected the album to be released around late Summer to Fall 2012.[52] In an interview with Billboard, Young revealed that the new album is around 80ÿ85% complete, and that Dr. Luke, JR Rotem, Norwegian production team Stargate, Brian Kennedy and Emily Wright are involved with the production of the album. He was also unsure whether \\"I Hope You Think of Me\\" would make the final track listing.[49]\\r\\nYoung, along with Jewel and Jay Sean, released a song in promotion of the Child Hunger Ends Here campaign by ConAgra Foods entitled \\"Here's Hope\\".[53][54] On April 17, 2012, \\"Dementia\\", a song by Young which was intended to be included on his upcoming album leaked onto the internet. The song features additional vocals by Mark Hoppus of Blink-182.[55]\\r\\nYoung announced that a new EP, Shooting Star, was to be released on May 15 and would feature four songs off his upcoming album, so that fans a could get clear taste of what the album would sound like.[56] On May 24, 2012, Young announced on Twitter that Owl City's fourth studio album would be titled The Midsummer Station,[57] and that it would be released on August 14, 2012, worldwide, apart from in the United Kingdom where it would be released on September 17, 2012.[58] On June 21, 2012, Young announced that the release date of the album would be pushed back to August 21, 2012, but the UK release date would remain the same.[59] On July 12, 2012, Young announced via Twitter that the UK release date would be pushed forward to August 20, 2012.[60]\\r\\nYoung announced via Twitter that he would be collaborating with Carly Rae Jepsen on a new song, claiming that it would be released on June 26, 2012.[61] On June 20, 2012, he released the single, \\"Good Time\\", via his SoundCloud account.[62][63] The song was released on iTunes on June 26, 2012. It received generally positive reviews from critics, including Billboard: \\"It only makes sense that he's joined by Jepsen...[on] a track that could become a radio staple for the rest of the summer,\\"[64] and Entertainment Weekly: \\"'Good Time' goes down easier than a frozen margarita at a beachfront tiki bar.\\"[63] \\"Good Time\\" was written by Matt Thiessen, Brian Lee and Young himself.[65] The song debuted at No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and later peaked at No. 8, becoming he second top 10 in United States.\\r\\nOn August 8, Young announced through his email newsletter that he would be holding a \\"Release Day Listening Party\\" on August 21.[66] and would be doing multiple TV performances, including The Today Show on August 22.[66]\\r\\nOn August 18, Young released a small clip of a studio version of \\"I Hope You Think of Me\\".

The track, called \\"Live It Up\\", was released in the soundtrack album.[84] Owl City released the single \\"Light of Christmas\\", which featured tobyMac, on October 22.[85][86] The song was created for the 2013 VeggieTales Christmas movie Merry Larry and the True Light of Christmas.[87][88]\\r\\n2014 saw the release of the single \\"Beautiful Times\\", which features violinist Lindsey Stirling and was released on April 8.[89] Young stated that he intended to release a steady \\"series of EPs\\" in 2014 rather than one larger recording,[90] though he later considered and then confirmed that he would be releasing a full studio album in 2014.[citation needed] In June, Young announced that the first extended play would be titled Ultraviolet, and it was released on June 27.[91][92] The day before, the \\"Beautiful Times\\" music video also made its debut on Rolling Stone's website.[93][94]\\r\\nOwl City appeared on The Art of McCartney tribute album to Paul McCartney, covering the track \\"Listen to What the Man Said\\".[95]\\r\\nOn October 7, Owl City uploaded the official audio stream for \\"Tokyo\\" featuring singer Sekai no Owari to his official OwlCityVEVO YouTube channel.[96] An official lyric video for another new track, \\"You're Not Alone\\" featuring Britt Nicole, was published on the following day.[97]\\r\\nIn December 2014, Owl City released a new single for Christmas: \\"Kiss Me Babe, It's Christmas Time\\".[98][99]\\r\\nOwl City released a promotional song, \\"2015\\", of him singing that he would be releasing a new album.[100] On May 5, a sneak peek of Owl City's then-upcoming song \\"Verge\\" featuring Aloe Blacc aired on ESPN's \\"Draft Academy.\\" The song was released on May 14.[101]\\r\\nIn April Young stated that Owl City would be returning with a new album, later announcing the release of Mobile Orchestra for July 10 of that year with a lead single \\"Verge\\".[102]\\r\\nAfter the single \\"Verge\\" featuring Aloe Blacc, Owl City released his second single called \\"My Everything\\" from Mobile Orchestra on June 5, 2015, followed by \\"Unbelievable\\" on June 25.\\r\\nAn animated video for \\"Unbelievable\\" was also released on June 29, 2015 and features Hanson.[103]\\r\\nOn December 18, 2015, Young announced that he would focus on a new project: each month [he would] compose and record a score based on a subject of his choice [...] something [he had] wanted to do for a long time.[104][105]\\r\\nOn November 24, 2016, Owl City released \\"Humbug\\", a new Christmas song along with a video.[106][better?source?needed]\\r\\nOn October 30, 2017, Young announced via his social media accounts that he would be releasing a new, 18-song album called Cinematic, with a release date of June 1, 2018.[107]\\r\\nHe revealed that during the eight months from October to June, three EPs, which he has called Reels, will be released with three songs each. He stated that the inspiration for this album is from \\"the amazing people [he's] met and the places that [he's] seen.\\"[108] The album's first single, \\"All My Friends\\", was released on November 3, 2017.[109] On December 1, 2017, Owl City released the first reel, titled Reel 1, containing songs, \\"Fiji Water\\", \\"The 5th of July\\", and \\"All My Friends.\\"[110] On January 12, 2018, a song from the album, \\"Lucid Dream\\", was released.[111]\\r\\nOwl City's music is described as indietronica and synth-pop and is often described as belonging under the electronic music genre.[112] Young has stated that he is inspired by disco and European electronic music, as well as instrumental genres such as drone, ambient, and post-rock. He cites his biggest influences as Johnathon Ford of Unwed Sailor and Thomas Newman. Young also incorporates some of his Christian faith into his music, since he is a vocal Christian.[113][114][115] Young's faith is evident on the album, All Things Bright and Beautiful, especially in \\"Galaxies\\". Explaining why the faith-filled song was added to the mix, he said, \\"I feel like if I were ever to hide the fact that that's what's so important to me, it would be a crime, that I should probably be put in jail for that.\\"[116]\\r\\nOwl City also has been compared to The Postal Service, often critically, for his combination of fuzzy synths, ironic lyrics and use of female guest singers.[117] Pitchfork.com goes to say that \\"The surprise No.?1 single in the country, Owl City's 'Fireflies', jacks the Postal Service in such a bald-faced, obvious manner that getting into specifics feels redundant at best and tacky at worst.\\"[118] In response to the suggestion that his work is derivative, Young suggested in a 2009 interview with The New York Times that Ocean Eyes is perhaps the \\"next chapter\\" after The Postal Service: \\"The Postal Service released a record in 2003, and that was it. There was really nothing to compare it to until some one else came along and wrote the next chapter. Maybe that's this record. Maybe that's this band.\\"[119]\\r\\nOwl City is one of Young's many solo projects, with all music written, composed, recorded, and produced by him.

Its format is a quiz competition in which contestants are presented with general knowledge clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in question form. Many contestants throughout the show's history have received significant media attention because of their success on Jeopardy!, particularly Brad Rutter, who has won the most money on the show, and Ken Jennings, who has the show's longest winning streak; Rutter and Jennings also hold the first- and second-place records respectively for most money ever won on American game shows. Other contestants went on to great accomplishments, including former U.S. senator and presidential candidate, the late John McCain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurns Cameron (born December 11, 1938) won a total of $11,110 in his appearances on Jeopardy!, including a then-record five-game total of $7,070 in December 1965. Cameron was also the winner of the third annual Tournament of Champions in 1966, in which he won $4,040. A still picture of Cameron receiving a \\"dummy\\" check still exists, as well as a still of him being greeted by Mel Brooks as the 2000-year-old man on the Fleming era 2000th show. Cameron is cited as one of the best players of the Art Fleming era of the show.[1] In 1990, when Jeopardy! creator Merv Griffin produced Super Jeopardy!, a separate weekly prime time network version based on the Trebek version of Jeopardy! to air Saturday nights in the summer on ABC, he invited Cameron to compete as the only player to represent the Fleming era. Cameron competed in the fifth quarterfinal game, where he finished in second (by one point) and won $5,000.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. senator and presidential candidate John McCain was a one-day champion in 1965 before he served in Vietnam, spent five and a half years as a POW, and later became a senator.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nHutton \\"Red\\" Gibson won the 1968 Tournament of Champions.[4] Gibson later became a prominent sedevacantist and conspiracy theorist; his son, Mel Gibson, later became an actor.\\r\\n\\r\\nJay Wolpert won the 1969 Tournament of Champions.[4] He later became known as a producer of game shows.\\r\\n\\r\\nJerry Frankel, (February 10, 1953 ÿ July 13, 1987) a musician and composer from Buffalo, New York, was a five-time undefeated champion during Jeopardy's first season, winning $32,650 on the program. He became that version's first ever Tournament of Champions winner, earning the $100,000 grand prize by defeating Bruce Fauman and Steve Rogitz in the two game final.[5]  Frankel died of AIDS less than 2 years after his victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nChuck Forrest (born June 3, 1961[6]) held the record for the largest non-tournament cash winnings total from 1985 to 1989, and the largest all-time winnings from 1986 to 1990. The producers of the show regarded him as one of the best and most memorable contestants of the 1980s.[1] Forrest is widely regarded by other elite Jeopardy! players to be one of the most formidable contestants to ever play.[7][8] Forrest won five consecutive games from September 30 to October 4, 1985, winning a then-record $72,800 and qualifying for the 1986 Tournament of Champions, which he won, earning another $100,000.[9] Forrest later played on the Super Jeopardy! tournament, the Million Dollar Masters tournament, the Ultimate Tournament of Champions and the Battle of the Decades tournament. Forrest implemented a strategy known as the \\"Forrest Bounce\\" to confuse opponents: the strategy involved picking each clue from a different category instead of taking the clues in order. With Mark Lowenthal, Forrest co-wrote the 1992 book Secrets of the Jeopardy! Champions.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nBob Verini was a five-time champion in 1987 and won the 1987 Tournament of Champions, using the money to finance several theatrical productions.[11][12][13][14] He was then the runner-up in Super Jeopardy! and finished third in the Million Dollar Masters. He also appeared in both the Ultimate Tournament of Champions and the Battle of the Decades, both times losing his first game. Prior to Ken Jennings, Verini held the record for most matches appeared in. Verini's career earnings on Jeopardy! and Super Jeopardy! are $276,802.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Cordray (born May 3, 1959) was a five-time Jeopardy! champion in 1987, while still serving as a law clerk, and also appeared in the 1987 Tournament of Champions. Cordray parleyed his success on Jeopardy! into political office, serving as an Ohio State Legislator, Attorney General of Ohio, and later as the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He was a participant in the Battle of the Decades Tournament, but was defeated in the first match and declined the prize money due to his office.\\r\\n\\r\\nMark M. Lowenthal won the 1988 Tournament of Champions.[15] He also appeared on Super Jeopardy!,[16] the Ultimate Tournament of Champions, and the Jeopardy! Battle of the Decades, beating Spangenberg in his initial game. Lowenthal is the co-author (along with Season 2 record-setting five-time champion and Tournament of Champions winner Chuck Forrest) of the 1992 book Secrets of the Jeopardy! Champions, and has also written a college textbook on intelligence and national security.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nTom Cubbage is the only contestant in Jeopardy! history to win both the show's College Championship and the Tournament of Champions. Cubbage became the first ever winner of the College Championship when the format made its debut in May 1989, winning $26,600. In November of that same year, he was the $100,000 grand prize winner of the 1989 Tournament of Champions. He also appeared on Super Jeopardy! in 1990, and earned $5,000 for appearing as a quarterfinalist.[17] 15 years later, in 2005, Cubbage competed in the Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions. In the first round, he lost his game, finishing in second place behind Bob Harris.[18] In 2014, Cubbage returned to Jeopardy! to compete in the show's Battle of the Decades. In his first game of the tournament, he scored a victory over fellow Jeopardy! alumni Bob Verini and Jerome Vered.[19] Cubbage lost his second game to Ken Jennings, but he finished the game with $19,500, allowing him to secure a wild-card spot in the next round.[20] In the semifinals, Cubbage lost again, finishing in third place behind Leszek Pawlowicz and eventual tournament winner Brad Rutter.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nEric Newhouse first appeared on Jeopardy! when he won the 1989 Teen Tournament. He was both a semifinalist in the 1989 Tournament of Champions and Super Jeopardy! After winning the 1998 Teen Reunion Tournament, Newhouse was invited to the Million Dollar Masters, where he placed second to Brad Rutter.[22] Newhouse was one of nine players who advanced directly to the second round of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions, but lost his initial game.\\r\\n\\r\\nBob Blake, an actuary from Vancouver, British Columbia, appeared on Jeopardy in September 1989, won five games (which until 2003, contestants were retired after five appearances), and broke Chuck Forrest's then five-day record with $82,501. Because Bob's winnings were higher than the then-limit of $75,000, $7,501 of his winnings were donated to his selected charity, Oxfam.[23] He also competed in Super Jeopardy![24] in which he was a Semi-Finalist. He was also the winner of the 1990 Tournament of Champions winning him in the process $100,000.[25] He also competed in the Ultimate Tournament of Champions in 2005. He was initially invited to compete in the Battle of the Decades tournament but declined because of conflicts with international travel.\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Frank Spangenberg (born July 26, 1957) garnered fame in 1990 when he set the five-day cumulative winnings record, becoming the first person to win more than $100,000 in five days on the show.[26] He has been called one of the \\"veritable legends\\" of the show.[27] He was also the first to exceed $30,000 (winning $30,600) in a single day.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpangenberg, at the time a member of the New York City Transit Police Department (now the Transit Bureau of the New York City Police Department), won $102,597 in five days. Prior to 2003, winners were retired after five consecutive victories and due to a winnings cap in place on Jeopardy! at the time, Spangenberg was only able to keep $75,000 of his total winnings; he donated the remaining $27,597 to the Gift of Love Hospice, a facility operated by the Missionaries of Charity. The $102,597 record stands as the all-time net five-day record because of 2001 rule changes regarding clue values, and the 2003 abolition of the five-day limit restricts the record to a contestant's first five days.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpangenberg also won Jeopardy!'s 10th Anniversary Tournament in 1993, winning $41,800,[29] and previously appeared in the 1990 Tournament of Champions, Super Jeopardy! earlier that year, and later competed in the 2002 Million Dollar Masters tournament, the 2005 Ultimate Tournament of Champions and the 2014 Battle of the Decades tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nJerome Vered (born March 13, 1958) appeared on Jeopardy! in 1992 and won $96,801 as a five-day champion and retired undefeated. His total winnings at the time were second to Frank Spangenberg's $102,597. During that run, he shattered the one-day record for dollar winnings, earning $34,000 in one episode.[30] After his five-day run, Vered returned for the 1992 Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions, finishing in third place[31] In the 2005 Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions, Vered won five games to advance to a three-game final match against fellow Jeopardy! legends Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. Vered finished in third place, earning $250,000.[32] Behind Rutter and Jennings, respectively, he is the third highest-earning contestant in Jeopardy! history, having won a total of $496,602. He competed in the 2014 Battle of the Decades but lost to Tom Cubbage.\\r\\n\\r\\nRyan \\"Fritz\\" Holznagel is the editor-in-chief of Who2 Biographies and the winner of Jeopardy's Tournament of Champions in 1995.[33] Holznagel also represented the U.S. at the show's first ever Olympic tournament in 1996. He later participated in the Ultimate Tournament of Champions in 2005, and again in the Battle of the Decades in 2014.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael George Dupee (born October 23, 1966) originally appeared on Jeopardy! in 1996, and won the Tournament of Champions that same year.[35] In 2005, Dupe participated in the Ultimate Tournament of Champions. He won his first match,[36] but was defeated by Robert Slaven in his second game of the tournament.[37] Nine years later, in 2014, Dupe competed in the Jeopardy! Battle of the Decades tournament, where he was defeated in the first round by Brad Rutter.[38] Dupe's total winnings on Jeopardy! is $203,901,[citation needed] including $66,401 won during his original five-day run;[39] $100,000 for winning the Tournament of Champions in 1996; $32,500 from the Ultimate Tournament of Champions; and $5,000 from the show's Battle of the Decades. Ken Jennings praised Dupe's book, How to Get on Jeopardy! and Win!, claiming it was the best preparation for competing on Jeopardy![40] In this book, which he wrote following his success on Jeopardy!, Dupe wrote about his experience on the show and also provided practice questions for aspiring contestants.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nBob Harris (born October 15, 1963) is a multi-time contestant on Jeopardy! [42][43] Harris first appeared as a contestant in 1997 and won $58,000 as a five-time champion on the show. The following year, Harris finished in third place in the Tournament of Champions behind Kim Worth and Dan Melia. In the first round of the Jeopardy! Million Dollar Masters tournament in 2002, Harris scored an upset victory over Rachael Schwartz and Frank Spangenberg.[44] He would lose in the semifinals, however, to Eric Newhouse.[45] In 2005, Harris competed again on the show, this time in the Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions. He won $24,400 and defeated fellow Jeopardy! alumni Frank Epstein and Tom Cubbage in Round 1 of the tournament,[18] but lost in Round 2 to fellow contestants Bruce Borchardt and Michael Daunt.[46] In 2014, Harris competed in the Battle of the Decades.

In 2014, Mueller competed in the show's Battle of the Decades.[60] The story about her first match in this tournament, which saw her compete against fellow Jeopardy! champions Dan Melia and Ryan (Fritz) Holznagel, was featured on Who2 Biographies.[61] Muller is slated to appear again in the 2019 Jeopardy! All-Star Games relay tournament with Alan Lin on Burnett's team.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrad Rutter (born January 31, 1978) is the biggest all-time money winner on Jeopardy! and briefly held the record for biggest cumulative game show winnings for any U.S. game show contestant. Rutter retained the record for Jeopardy! winnings with either $4,255,102 or $4,270,102, and a pair of Chevrolet Camaros. Rutter became a five-day undefeated champion on Jeopardy! in 2000, with a total of $55,102.

In twenty games against humans only, Rutter has never lost an official Jeopardy! match, though he was defeated in an exhibition match by the Watson supercomputer and Ken Jennings (who outpointed Rutter in the two-game match).  He is slated to appear again in the 2019 Jeopardy! All-Star Games relay tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nKen Jennings (born May 23, 1974) first appeared on Jeopardy! on June 2, 2004, a time shortly after producers of the game show relaxed the limit on the number of times a contestant could appear on the show. Because the five-game limit was removed, Jennings continued to win and eventually broke the winnings record set by Tom Walsh, who had won $186,900 in eight games earlier in 2004.\\r\\n\\r\\nJennings continued to win and eventually set a record of 74 wins before he was defeated by Nancy Zerg in his seventy-fifth appearance.

In addition, at the end of Season 20, he set a then-new one-day record of $75,000 (which would later be broken by Roger Craig, see below).[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his first run of Jeopardy! appearances, Jennings earned the record for the highest American game show winnings. His total was later surpassed by Brad Rutter, who defeated Jennings in the finals of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions, adding $2,000,000 to his earlier Jeopardy! winnings. Jennings regained the record after appearing on several other game shows, including appearances on 1 vs. 100 and Grand Slam, culminating in an appearance on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? in which he won $500,000. However, Rutter retains the Jeopardy! record by defeating Jennings in the finals of the Battle of the Decades tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter his success on Jeopardy!, Jennings wrote of his experience and explored American trivia history and culture in Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs, published in 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nJennings returned to Jeopardy! finishing runner-up to the Watson Supercomputer (splitting $300,000 with a charity) and again for the Battle of the Decades where he finished runner-up to Brad Rutter again (winning $100,000).

All-Star Games relay tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur Chu (born January 30, 1984) first appeared on Jeopardy! on January 28, 2014 and almost immediately became a lightning rod because of his unusual playing style. His game theory, \\"Forrest Bounce,\\" and furiously pressing his signaling device have made him one of the show's most controversial contestants. As of October 21, 2015, Chu is currently ranked fifth on the list of all-time highest-earning Jeopardy! non-tournament champions,[74] with an eleven-day total of $297,200.

The brand's initial processors were very similar to the earlier Pentium II-branded microprocessors. The most notable differences were the addition of the SSE instruction set (to accelerate floating point and parallel calculations), and the introduction of a controversial serial number embedded in the chip during the manufacturing process.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly to the Pentium II it superseded, the Pentium III was also accompanied by the Celeron brand for lower-end versions, and the Xeon for high-end (server and workstation) derivatives. The Pentium III was eventually superseded by the Pentium 4, but its Tualatin core also served as the basis for the Pentium M CPUs, which used many ideas from the P6 microarchitecture. Subsequently, it was the Pentium M microarchitecture of Pentium M branded CPUs, and not the NetBurst found in Pentium 4 processors, that formed the basis for Intel's energy-efficient Core microarchitecture of CPUs branded Core 2, Pentium Dual-Core, Celeron (Core), and Xeon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Pentium III variant was the Katmai (Intel product code 80525). It was a further development of the Deschutes Pentium II. The Pentium III saw an increase of 2 million transistors over the Pentium II. The differences were the addition of execution units and SSE instruction support, and an improved L1 cache controller[citation needed] (the L2 cache controller was left unchanged, as it would be completely redesigned for Coppermine anyway), which were responsible for the minor performance improvements over the \\"Deschutes\\" Pentium IIs. It was first released at speeds of 450 and 500?MHz in February 1999. Two more versions were released: 550?MHz on May 17, 1999 and 600?MHz on August 2, 1999. On September 27, 1999 Intel released the 533B and 600B running at 533 & 600?MHz respectively. The 'B' suffix indicated that it featured a 133?MHz FSB, instead of the 100?MHz FSB of previous models.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Katmai contains 9.5 million transistors, not including the 512 Kbytes L2 cache (which adds 25 million transistors), and has dimensions of 12.3?mm by 10.4?mm (128?mm2). It is fabricated in Intel's P856.5 process, a 0.25 micrometre CMOS process with five levels of aluminum interconnect.[2] The Katmai used the same slot-based design as the Pentium II but with the newer SECC2 cartridge that allowed direct CPU core contact with the heat sink. There have been some early models of the Pentium?III with 450 and 500?MHz packaged in an older SECC cartridge intended for OEMs.\\r\\n\\r\\nA notable stepping for enthusiasts was SL35D. This version of Katmai was officially rated for 450?MHz, but often contained cache chips for the 600?MHz model and thus usually was capable of running at 600?MHz.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second version, codenamed Coppermine (Intel product code: 80526), was released on October 25, 1999, running at 500, 533, 550, 600, 650, 667, 700, and 733?MHz. From December 1999 to May 2000, Intel released Pentium IIIs running at speeds of 750, 800, 850, 866, 900, 933 and 1000?MHz (1?GHz). Both 100?MHz FSB and 133?MHz FSB models were made. For models that were already available with the same frequency, an \\"E\\" was appended to the model name to indicate cores using the new 0.18 m fabrication process. An additional \\"B\\" was later appended to designate 133?MHz FSB models, resulting in an \\"EB\\" suffix. In terms of overall performance, the Coppermine held a slight advantage over the AMD Athlons it was released against, which was reversed when AMD applied their own die shrink and added an on-die L2 cache to the Athlon. Athlon held the advantage in floating-point intensive code, while the Coppermine could perform better when SSE optimizations were used, but in practical terms there was little difference in how the two chips performed, clock-for-clock. However, AMD were able to clock the Athlon higher, reaching speeds of 1.2?GHz before the launch of the Pentium 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of performance, Coppermine arguably marked a bigger step than Katmai by introducing an on-chip L2 cache (which Intel called Advanced Transfer Cache, or ATC). The ATC operates at the core clock rate and has a capacity of 256?KB, twice that of the on-chip cache previously seen on Mendocino Celerons. It is eight-way set-associative and is accessed via a Double Quad Word Wide 256-bit bus, four times as wide as Katmai's. Furthermore, latency was dropped to a quarter compared to Katmai. Another marketing term by Intel was Advanced System Buffering, which encompassed improvements to better take advantage of a 133 MHz system bus. These include 6 fill buffers (vs. 4 on Katmai), 8 bus queue entries (vs. 4 on Katmai) and 4 write-back buffers (vs. 1 on Katmai).[3] Under competitive pressure from the AMD Athlon, Intel re-worked the internals, finally removing some well-known pipeline stalls.[citation needed] The result was that applications affected by these pipeline stalls ran faster on the Coppermine by up to 30%.[citation needed] The Coppermine contained 29 million transistors and was fabricated in a 0.18?m process. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough its codename gives the impression that it used copper interconnects, its interconnects were in fact aluminium. The Coppermine was packaged in a 370-pin FC-PGA or FC-PGA2 for use with Socket 370, or in SECC2 for Slot 1. Early PGA versions have an exposed die, whereas higher frequency SKUs (866, 933, 1000EB, 1133) were also produced in an FC-PGA2 variant with integrated heat spreader (IHS) to improve contact between the die and the heatsink. This in itself did not improve thermal conductivity, since it added another layer of metal and thermal paste between the die and the heatsink, but it greatly assisted in holding the heatsink flat against the die.  Earlier Coppermines without the IHS made heatsink mounting challenging.[4] If the heatsink was not flat against the die, heat transfer efficiency was greatly reduced. Some heatsink manufacturers began providing pads on their products, similar to what AMD did with the \\"Thunderbird\\" Athlon to ensure that the heatsink was mounted flatly. The enthusiast community went so far as to create shims to assist in maintaining a flat interface.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1.13?GHz version was released in mid-2000 but famously recalled after a collaboration between HardOCP and Tom's Hardware[6] discovered various instabilities with the operation of the new CPU speed grade. The Coppermine core was unable to reliably reach the 1.13?GHz speed without various tweaks to the processor's microcode, effective cooling, additional voltage (1.75 V vs. 1.65 V), and specifically validated platforms.[6] Intel only officially supported the processor on its own VC820 i820-based motherboard, but even this motherboard displayed instability in the independent tests of the hardware review sites. In benchmarks that were stable, performance was shown to be sub-par, with the 1.13?GHz CPU equalling a 1.0?GHz model. Tom's Hardware attributed this performance deficit to relaxed tuning of the CPU and motherboard to improve stability.[7] Intel needed at least six months to resolve the problems using a new cD0 stepping and re-released 1.1?GHz and 1.13?GHz versions in 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft's Xbox game console uses a variant of the Pentium III/Mobile Celeron family in a Micro-PGA2 form factor. The sSpec designator of the chips is SL5Sx, which makes it most similar to the Mobile Celeron Coppermine-128 processor. It shares with the Coppermine-128 Celeron its 128?KB L2 cache, and 180?nm process technology, but keeps the 8-way cache associativity from the Pentium III.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis revision is an intermediate step between Coppermine and Tualatin, with support for lower-voltage system logic present on the latter but core power within previously defined voltage specs of the former so it could work in older system boards.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntel used the latest Coppermines with the cD0-Stepping and modified them so that they worked with low voltage system bus operation at 1.25 V AGTL as well as normal 1.5 V AGTL+ signal levels, and would auto detect differential or single-ended clocking. This modification made them compatible to the latest generation Socket-370 boards supporting FC-PGA2 packaged CPUs while maintaining compatibility with the older FC-PGA boards. The Coppermine T also had two way symmetrical multiprocessing capabilities, but only in FC-PGA2 boards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey can be distinguished from Tualatin processors by their part numbers, which include the digits: 80533  e.g. the 1133?MHz SL5QK P/N is: RK80533PZ006256, while the 1000?MHz SL5QJ P/N is: RK80533PZ001256.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third revision, Tualatin (80530), was a trial for Intel's new 0.13?m process. Tualatin-based Pentium IIIs were released during 2001 until early 2002 at speeds of 1.0, 1.13, 1.2, 1.26, 1.33 and 1.4?GHz. A basic shrink of Coppermine, no new features were added, except for added data prefetch logic similar to Pentium 4 and Athlon XP for potentially better use of the L2 cache, although its use compared to these newer CPUs is limited due to the relatively smaller FSB bandwidth (FSB was still kept at 133?MHz).[10] Variants with 256 and 512?KB L2 cache were produced, the latter being dubbed Pentium III-S; this variant was mainly intended for low-power consumption servers and also exclusively featured SMP support within the Tualatin line.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Socket 370 designation was kept, the use of 1.25 AGTL signaling in place of 1.5V AGTL+ rendered previous motherboards incompatible.[10] This confusion carried over to the chipset naming, where only the B-stepping of the i815 chipset was compatible with Tualatin processors.[11] A new VRM guideline was also designed by Intel, version 8.5, which required finer voltage steps and debuted load line Vcore (in place of fixed voltage regardless of current on 8.4).[12][13][14] Some motherboard manufacturers would mark the change with blue sockets (instead of white), and were often also backwards compatible with Coppermine CPUs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tualatin also formed the basis for the highly popular Pentium III-M mobile processor, which became Intel's front-line mobile chip (the Pentium 4 drew significantly more power, and so was not well-suited for this role) for the next two years. The chip offered a good balance between power consumption and performance, thus finding a place in both performance notebooks and the \\"thin and light\\" category.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tualatin-based Pentium III performed well in some applications compared to the fastest Willamette-based Pentium 4, and even the Thunderbird-based Athlons. Despite this, its appeal was limited due to the aforementioned incompatibility with existing systems, and Intel's only officially supported chipset for Tualatins (except 3rd party server-line chipsets found on expensive server boards), the i815, could only handle 512 MB RAM and had slightly inferior performance because of a maximum in-order queue depth of 4, compared to 8 with the older, incompatible 440BX chipset. However, the enthusiast community found a way to run Tualatins on then-ubiquitous BX chipset based boards, although it was often a non-trivial task and required some degree of technical skills.\\r\\n\\r\\nTualatin-based Pentium III CPUs can usually be visually distinguished from Coppermine-based processors by the metal integrated heat-spreader (IHS) fixed on top of the package. However, the very last models of Coppermine Pentium IIIs also featured the IHS  the integrated heat spreader is actually what distinguishes the FC-PGA2 package from the FC-PGA  both are for Socket 370 motherboards.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the addition of the heat spreader, it was sometimes difficult to install a heatsink on a Pentium III. One had to be careful not to put force on the core at an angle because doing so would cause the edges and corners of the core to crack and could destroy the CPU. It was also sometimes difficult to achieve a flat mating of the CPU and heatsink surfaces, a factor of critical importance to good heat transfer. This became increasingly challenging with the Socket 370 CPUs, compared with their Slot 1 predecessors, because of the force required to mount a socket-based cooler and the narrower, 2-sided mounting mechanism (Slot 1 featured 4-point mounting). As such, and because the 0.13?m Tualatin had an even smaller core surface area than the 0.18?m Coppermine, Intel installed the metal heatspreader on Tualatin and all future desktop processors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tualatin core was named after the Tualatin Valley and Tualatin River in Oregon, where Intel has large manufacturing and design facilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Katmai was built in the same 0.25?m process as Pentium II \\"Deschutes\\", it had to implement SSE using as little silicon as possible.[16] To achieve this goal, Intel implemented the 128-bit architecture by double-cycling the existing 64-bit data paths and by merging the SIMD-FP multiplier unit with the x87 scalar FPU multiplier into a single unit. To utilize the existing 64-bit data paths, Katmai issues each SIMD-FP instruction as two ops. To compensate partially for implementing only half of SSEs architectural width, Katmai implements the SIMD-FP adder as a separate unit on the second dispatch port. This organization allows one half of a SIMD multiply and one half of an independent SIMD add to be issued together bringing the peak throughput back to four floating point operations per cycle  at least for code with an even distribution of multiplies and adds.[2][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue was that Katmais hardware-implementation contradicted the parallelism model implied by the SSE instruction-set. Programmers faced a code-scheduling dilemma: Should the SSE-code be tuned for Katmai's limited execution resources, or should it be tuned for a future processor with more resources?  Katmai-specific SSE optimizations yielded the best possible performance from the Pentium III family but was suboptimal for Coppermine onwards as well as future Intel processors, such as the Pentium 4 and Core series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pentium III was the first x86 CPU to include a unique, retrievable, identification number, called PSN (Processor Serial Number). A Pentium III's PSN can be read by software through the CPUID instruction if this feature has not been disabled through the BIOS.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 29, 1999, the Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA) Panel of the European Parliament, following their report on electronic surveillance techniques asked parliamentary committee members to consider legal measures that would \\"prevent these chips from being installed in the computers of European citizens.\\"[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIntel eventually removed the PSN feature from Tualatin-based Pentium IIIs, and the feature was not present in Pentium 4 or Pentium M.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntel datasheets","input":"When was the intel pentium iii processor introduced?"},{"output":"Norte Chico civilization","context":"The prehistory of the Americas (North, South, and Central America, and the Caribbean) begins with people migrating to these areas from Asia during the height of an Ice Age. These groups are generally believed to have been isolated from peoples of the \\"Old World\\" until the coming of Europeans in the 10th century from Norway and with the voyages of Christopher Columbus in 1492.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ancestors of today's American Indigenous peoples were the Paleo-Indians; they were hunter-gatherers who migrated into North America. The most popular theory asserts that migrants came to the Americas via Beringia, the land mass now covered by the ocean waters of the Bering Strait. Small lithic stage peoples followed megafauna like bison, mammoth (now extinct), and caribou, thus gaining the modern nickname \\"big-game hunters.\\" Groups of people may also have traveled into North America on shelf or sheet ice along the northern Pacific coast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCultural traits brought by the first immigrants later evolved and spawned such cultures as Iroquois on North America and Pirah? of South America. These cultures later developed into civilizations. In many cases, these cultures expanded at a later date than their Old World counterparts. Cultures that may be considered[citation needed] advanced or civilized include Norte Chico, Cahokia, Zapotec, Toltec, Olmec, Maya, Aztec, Chimor, Mixtec, Moche, Mississippian, Puebloan, Totonac, Teotihuacan, Huastec people, Purpecha, Izapa, Mazatec, Muisca, and the Inca.\\r\\nAfter the voyages of Christopher Columbus in 1492, Spanish, Portuguese and later English, French and Dutch colonial expeditions arrived in the New World, conquering and settling the discovered lands, which led to a transformation of the cultural and physical landscape in the Americas. Spain colonized most of the Americas from present-day Southwestern United States, Florida and the Caribbean to the southern tip of South America. Portugal settled in what is mostly present-day Brazil while England established colonies on the Eastern coast of the United States, as well as the North Pacific coast and in most of Canada. France settled in Quebec and other parts of Eastern Canada and claimed an area in what is today the central United States. The Netherlands settled New Netherland (administrative centre New Amsterdam - now New York), some Caribbean islands and parts of Northern South America.\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean colonization of the Americas led to the rise of new cultures, civilizations and eventually states, which resulted from the fusion of Native American and European traditions, peoples and institutions. The transformation of American cultures through colonization is evident in architecture, religion, gastronomy, the arts and particularly languages, the most widespread being Spanish (376 million speakers), English (348 million) and Portuguese (201 million). The colonial period lasted approximately three centuries, from the early 16th to the early 19th centuries, when Brazil and the larger Hispanic American nations declared independence. The United States obtained independence from England much earlier, in 1776, while Canada formed a federal dominion in 1867. Others remained attached to their European parent state until the end of the 19th century, such as Cuba and Puerto Rico which were linked to Spain until 1898. Smaller territories such as Guyana obtained independence in the mid-20th century, while certain Caribbean islands and French Guiana remain part of a European power to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe specifics of Paleo-Indian migration to and throughout the Americas, including the exact dates and routes traveled, are subject to ongoing research and discussion.[1] The traditional theory has been that these early migrants moved into the Beringia land bridge between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska around 40,000 ÿ 17,000 years ago, when sea levels were significantly lowered due to the Quaternary glaciation.[1][2] These people are believed to have followed herds of now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna along ice-free corridors that stretched between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets.[3] Another route proposed is that, either on foot or using primitive boats, they migrated down the Pacific Northwest coast to South America.[4] Evidence of the latter would since have been covered by a sea level rise of a hundred meters following the last ice age.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nArchaeologists contend that the Paleo-Indian migration out of Beringia (eastern Alaska), ranges from 40,000 to around 16,500 years ago.[6][7][8] This time range is a hot source of debate. The few agreements achieved to date are the origin from Central Asia, with widespread habitation of the Americas during the end of the last glacial period, or more specifically what is known as the late glacial maximum, around 16,000 ÿ 13,000 years before present.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Journal of Human Genetics released an article in 2007 stating \\"Here we show, by using 86 complete mitochondrial genomes, that all Indigenous American haplogroups, including Haplogroup X (mtDNA), were part of a single founding population.\\"[10] Amerindian groups in the Bering Strait region exhibit perhaps the strongest DNA or mitochondrial DNA relations to Siberian peoples. The genetic diversity of Amerindian indigenous groups increase with distance from the assumed entry point into the Americas.[11][12] Certain genetic diversity patterns from West to East suggest, particularly in South America, that migration proceeded first down the west coast, and then proceeded eastward.[13] Geneticists have variously estimated that peoples of Asia and the Americas were part of the same population from 42,000 to 21,000 years ago.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew studies shed light on the founding population of indigenous Americans, suggesting that their ancestry traced to both east Asian and western Eurasians who migrated to North America directly from Siberia. A 2013 study in the journal Nature reported that DNA found in the 24,000-year-old remains of a young boy in Malta Siberia suggest that up to one-third of the indigenous Americans may have ancestry that can be traced back to western Eurasians, who may have \\"had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought\\"[15] Professor Kelly Graf said that \\"Our findings are significant at two levels. First, it shows that Upper Paleolithic Siberians came from a cosmopolitan population of early modern humans that spread out of Africa to Europe and Central and South Asia. Second, Paleoindian skeletons with phenotypic traits atypical of modern-day Native Americans can be explained as having a direct historical connection to Upper Paleolithic Siberia.\\" A route through Beringia is seen as more likely than the Solutrean hypothesis.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 3, 2014, the Oregon cave where the oldest DNA evidence of human habitation in North America was found was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The DNA, radiocarbon dated to 14,300 years ago, was found in fossilized human coprolites uncovered in the Paisley Five Mile Point Caves in south central Oregon.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lithic stage or Paleo-Indian period, is the earliest classification term referring to the first stage of human habitation in the Americas, covering the Late Pleistocene epoch. The time period derives its name from the appearance of \\"Lithic flaked\\" stone tools. Stone tools, particularly projectile points and scrapers, are the primary evidence of the earliest well known human activity in the Americas. Lithic reduction stone tools are used by archaeologists and anthropologists to classify cultural periods.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral thousand years after the first migrations, the first complex civilizations arose as hunter-gatherers settled into semi-agricultural communities. Identifiable sedentary settlements began to emerge in the so-called Middle Archaic period around 6000 BCE. Particular archaeological cultures can be identified and easily classified throughout the Archaic period.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late Archaic, on the north-central coastal region of Peru, a complex civilization arose which has been termed the Norte Chico civilization, also known as Caral-Supe. It is the oldest known civilization in the Americas and one of the five sites where civilization originated independently and indigenously in the ancient world, flourishing between the 30th and 18th centuries BC. It pre-dated the Mesoamerican Olmec civilization by nearly two millennia. It was contemporaneous with the Egypt following the unification of its kingdom under Narmer and the emergence of the first Egyptian hieroglyphics.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonumental architecture, including earthwork platform mounds and sunken plazas have been identified as part of the civilization. Archaeological evidence points to the use of textile technology and the worship of common god symbols. Government, possibly in the form of theocracy, is assumed to have been required to manage the region. However, numerous questions remain about its organization. In archaeological nomenclature, the culture was pre-ceramic culture of the pre-Columbian Late Archaic period. It appears to have lacked ceramics and art.\\r\\n\\r\\nOngoing scholarly debate persists over the extent to which the flourishing of Norte Chico resulted from its abundant maritime food resources, and the relationship that these resources would suggest between coastal and inland sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe role of seafood in the Norte Chico diet has been a subject of scholarly debate. In 1973, examining the Aspero region of Norte Chico, Michael E. Moseley contended that a maritime subsistence (seafood) economy had been the basis of society and its early flourishing. This theory, later termed \\"maritime foundation of Andean Civilization\\" was at odds with the general scholarly consensus that civilization arose as a result of intensive grain-based agriculture, as had been the case in the emergence of civilizations in northeast Africa (Egypt) and southwest Asia (Mesopotamia).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile earlier research pointed to edible domestic plants such as squash, beans, lucuma, guava, pacay, and camote at Caral, publications by Haas and colleagues have added avocado, achira, and corn (Zea Mays) to the list of foods consumed in the region. In 2013, Haas and colleagues reported that maize was a primary component of the diet throughout the period of 3000 to 1800 BC.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton was another widespread crop in Norte Chico, essential to the production of fishing nets and textiles. Jonathan Haas noted a mutual dependency, whereby \\"The prehistoric residents of the Norte Chico needed the fish resources for their protein and the fishermen needed the cotton to make the nets to catch the fish.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2005 book 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus, journalist Charles C. Mann surveyed the literature at the time, reporting a date \\"sometime before 3200 BC, and possibly before 3500 BC\\" as the beginning date for the formation of Norte Chico. He notes that the earliest date securely associated with a city is 3500 BC, at Huaricanga in the (inland) Fortaleza area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Norte Chico civilization began to decline around 1800 BC as more powerful centers appeared to the south and north along its coast, and to the east within the Andes Mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the decline of the Norte Chico civilization, several large, centralized civilizations developed in the Western Hemisphere: Chavin, Nazca, Moche, Huari, Quitus, Ca?aris, Chimu, Pachacamac, Tiahuanaco, Aymara and Inca in the Central Andes (Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia); Muisca in Colombia?; Tanos in Dominican Republic (Hispaniola, Espa?ola) and part of Caribbean; and the Olmecs, Maya, Toltecs, Mixtecs, Zapotecs, Aztecs and Purepecha in southern North America (Mexico, Guatemala).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Olmec civilization was the first Mesoamerican civilization, beginning around 1600-1400 BC and ending around 400 BC. Mesoamerica is considered one of the six sites around the globe in which civilization developed independently and indigenously. This civilization is considered the mother culture of the Mesoamerican civilizations. The Mesoamerican calendar, numeral system, writing, and much of the Mesoamerican pantheon seem to have begun with the Olmec.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome elements of agriculture seem to have been practiced in Mesoamerica quite early. The domestication of maize is thought to have begun around 7,500 to 12,000 years ago. The earliest record of lowland maize cultivation dates to around 5100 BC.[19] Agriculture continued to be mixed with a hunting-gathering-fishing lifestyle until quite late compared to other regions, but by 2700 BC, Mesoamericans were relying on maize, and living mostly in villages. Temple mounds and classes started to appear. By 1300/ 1200 BC, small centres coalesced into the Olmec civilization, which seems to have been a set of city-states, united in religious and commercial concerns. The Olmec cities had ceremonial complexes with earth/clay pyramids, palaces, stone monuments, aqueducts and walled plazas. The first of these centers was at San Lorenzo (until 900 bc). La Venta was the last great Olmec centre. Olmec artisans sculpted jade and clay figurines of Jaguars and humans. Their iconic giant heads - believed to be of Olmec rulers - stood in every major city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Olmec civilization ended in 400 BC, with the defacing and destruction of San Lorenzo and La Venta, two of the major cities. It nevertheless spawned many other states, most notably the Mayan civilization, whose first cities began appearing around 700-600 BC. Olmec influences continued to appear in many later Mesoamerican civilizations.\\r\\n\\r\\nCities of the Aztecs, Mayas, and Incas were as large and organized as the largest in the Old World, with an estimated population of 200,000 to 350,000 in Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec empire. The market established in the city was said to have been the largest ever seen by the conquistadors when they arrived. The capital of the Cahokians, Cahokia, located near modern East St. Louis, Illinois, may have reached a population of over 20,000. At its peak, between the 12th and 13th centuries, Cahokia may have been the most populous city in North America. Monk's Mound, the major ceremonial center of Cahokia, remains the largest earthen construction of the prehistoric New World.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese civilizations developed agriculture as well, breeding maize (corn) from having ears 2ÿ5?cm in length to perhaps 10ÿ15?cm in length. Potatoes, tomatoes, pumpkins, beans, avocados, and chocolate are now the most popular of the pre-Columbian agricultural products. The civilizations did not develop extensive livestock as there were few suitable species, although alpacas and llamas were domesticated for use as beasts of burden and sources of wool and meat in the Andes. By the 15th century, maize was being farmed in the Mississippi River Valley after introduction from Mexico. The course of further agricultural development was greatly altered by the arrival of Europeans.\\r\\n\\r\\nCahokia was a major regional chiefdom, with trade and tributary chiefdoms located in a range of areas from bordering the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Iroquois League of Nations or \\"People of the Long House\\", based in present-day upstate and western New York, had a confederacy model from the mid-15th?century.  It has been suggested that their culture contributed to political thinking during the development of the later United States government. Their system of affiliation was a kind of federation, different from the strong, centralized European monarchies.[20][21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeadership was restricted to a group of 50 sachem chiefs, each representing one clan within a tribe; the Oneida and Mohawk people had nine seats each; the Onondagas held fourteen; the Cayuga had ten seats; and the Seneca had eight. Representation was not based on population numbers, as the Seneca tribe greatly outnumbered the others. When a sachem chief died, his successor was chosen by the senior woman of his tribe in consultation with other female members of the clan; property and hereditary leadership were passed matrilineally. Decisions were not made through voting but through consensus decision making, with each sachem chief holding theoretical veto power. The Onondaga were the \\"firekeepers\\", responsible for raising topics to be discussed. They occupied one side of a three-sided fire (the Mohawk and Seneca sat on one side of the fire, the Oneida and Cayuga sat on the third side.)[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth Tooker, an anthropologist, has said that it was unlikely the US founding fathers were inspired by the confederacy, as it bears little resemblance to the system of governance adopted in the United States. For example, it is based on inherited rather than elected leadership, selected by female members of the tribes, consensus decision-making regardless of population size of the tribes, and a single group capable of bringing matters before the legislative body.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nLong-distance trading did not prevent warfare and displacement among the indigenous peoples, and their oral histories tell of numerous migrations to the historic territories where Europeans encountered them. The Iroquois invaded and attacked tribes in the Ohio River area of present-day Kentucky and claimed the hunting grounds. Historians have placed these events as occurring as early as the 13th?century, or in the 17th?century Beaver Wars.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough warfare, the Iroquois drove several tribes to migrate west to what became known as their historically traditional lands west of the Mississippi River. Tribes originating in the Ohio Valley who moved west included the Osage, Kaw, Ponca and Omaha people. By the mid-17th century, they had resettled in their historical lands in present-day Kansas, Nebraska, Arkansas and Oklahoma. The Osage warred with Caddo-speaking Native Americans, displacing them in turn by the mid-18th century and dominating their new historical territories.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Kiva of Chetro Ketl at the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\r\\n\\r\\nCliff Palace, Mesa Verde National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaos Pueblo, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is an Ancient Pueblo belonging to a Native American tribe of Pueblo people, marking the cultural development in the region during the Pre-Columbian era.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite House Ruins, Canyon de Chelly National Monument\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pueblo people of what is now the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico, living conditions were that of large stone apartment like adobe structures. They live in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, and possibly surrounding areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nChichimeca was the name that the Mexica (Aztecs) generically applied to a wide range of semi-nomadic peoples who inhabited the north of modern-day Mexico, and carried the same sense as the European term \\"barbarian\\". The name was adopted with a pejorative tone by the Spaniards when referring especially to the semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer peoples of northern Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Zapotec emerged around 1500 years BCE. Their writing system influenced the later Olmec. They left behind the great city Monte Alban.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Olmec civilization emerged around 1200 BCE in Mesoamerica and ended around 400 BCE. Olmec art and concepts influenced surrounding cultures after their downfall. This civilization was thought to be the first in America to develop a writing system. After the Olmecs abandoned their cities for unknown reasons, the Maya, Zapotec and Teotihuacan arose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Purepecha civilization emerged around 1000 CE in Mesoamerica . They flourished from 1100 CE to 1530 CE. They continue to live on in the state of Michoacn. Fierce warriors, they were never conquered and in their glory years, successfully sealed off huge areas from Aztec domination.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaya history spans 3,000 years. The Classic Maya may have collapsed due to changing climate in the end of the 10th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Toltec were a nomadic people, dating from the 10th - 12th century, whose language was also spoken by the Aztecs.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeotihuacan (4th century BCE - 7/8th century CE) was both a city, and an empire of the same name, which, at its zenith between 150 and the 5th century, covered most of Mesoamerica.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Aztec having started to build their empire around 14th century found their civilization abruptly ended by the Spanish conquistadors. They lived in Mesoamerica, and surrounding lands. Their capital city Tenochtitlan was one of the largest cities of all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest known civilization of the Americas was established in the Norte Chico region of modern Peru. Complex society emerged in the group of coastal valleys, between 3000 and 1800 BCE. The Quipu, a distinctive recording device among Andean civilizations, apparently dates from the era of Norte Chico's prominence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chavn established a trade network and developed agriculture by as early as (or late compared to the Old World) 900 BCE according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavn in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chavn civilization spanned from 900 BCE to 300 BCE.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolding their capital at the great city of Cusco, the Inca civilization dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533.\\r\\nKnown as Tahuantinsuyu, or \\"the land of the four regions\\", in Quechua, the Inca culture was highly distinct and developed. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. Terrace farming was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork and even successful trepanation of the skull in Inca civilization.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround 1000, the Vikings established a short-lived settlement in Newfoundland, now known as L'Anse aux Meadows. Speculations exist about other Old World discoveries of the New World, but none of these are generally or completely accepted by most scholars.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpain sponsored a major exploration led by Italian explorer Christopher Columbus in 1492; it quickly led to extensive European colonization of the Americas. The Europeans brought Old World diseases which are thought to have caused catastrophic epidemics and a huge decrease of the native population. Columbus came at a time in which many technical developments in sailing techniques and communication made it possible to report his voyages easily and to spread word of them throughout Europe. It was also a time of growing religious, imperial and economic rivalries that led to a competition for the establishment of colonies.\\r\\n\\r\\n15th to 19th century colonies in the New World:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe formation of sovereign states in the New World began with the United States Declaration of Independence of 1776. The American Revolutionary War lasted through the period of the Siege of Yorktown  its last major campaign  in the early autumn of 1781, with peace being achieved in 1783.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spanish colonies won their independence in the first quarter of the 19th century, in the Spanish American wars of independence. Sim܇n Bolvar and Jos de San Martn, among others, led their independence struggle. Although Bolivar attempted to keep the Spanish-speaking parts of Latin America politically allied, they rapidly became independent of one another as well, and several further wars were fought, such as the Paraguayan War and the War of the Pacific. (See Latin American integration.) In the Portuguese colony Dom Pedro I (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese king Dom Jo?o VI, proclaimed the country's independence in 1822 and became Brazil's first Emperor. This was peacefully accepted by the crown in Portugal, upon compensation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlavery has had a significant role in the economic development of the New World after the colonization of the Americas by the Europeans. The cotton, tobacco, and sugar cane harvested by slaves became important exports for the United States and the Caribbean countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a part of the British Empire, Canada immediately entered World War I when it broke out in 1914. Canada bore the brunt of several major battles during the early stages of the war, including the use of poison gas attacks at Ypres. Losses became grave, and the government eventually brought in conscription, despite the fact this was against the wishes of the majority of French Canadians. In the ensuing Conscription Crisis of 1917, riots broke out on the streets of Montreal. In neighboring Newfoundland, the new dominion suffered a devastating loss on July 1, 1916, the First day on the Somme.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States stayed out of the conflict until 1917, when it joined the Entente powers. The United States was then able to play a crucial role at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that shaped interwar Europe. Mexico was not part of the war, as the country was embroiled in the Mexican Revolution at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1920s brought an age of great prosperity in the United States, and to a lesser degree Canada. But the Wall Street Crash of 1929 combined with drought ushered in a period of economic hardship in the United States and Canada. From 1936 to 1949, there was a popular uprising against the anti-Catholic Mexican government of the time, set off specifically by the anti-clerical provisions of the Mexican Constitution of 1917.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again, Canada found itself at war before its neighbors, however even Canadian contributions were slight before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The entry of the United States into the war helped to tip the balance in favour of the allies. Two Mexican tankers, transporting oil to the United States, were attacked and sunk by the Germans in the Gulf of Mexico waters, in 1942. The incident happened in spite of Mexico's neutrality at that time. This led Mexico to enter the conflict with a declaration of war on the Axis nations. The destruction of Europe wrought by the war vaulted all North American countries to more important roles in world affairs, especially the United States, which emerged as a \\"superpower\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early Cold War era saw the United States as the most powerful nation in a Western coalition of which Mexico and Canada were also a part. In Canada, Quebec was transformed by the Quiet Revolution and the emergence of Quebec nationalism. Mexico experienced an era of huge economic growth after World War II, a heavy industrialization process and a growth of its middle class, a period known in Mexican history as \\"El Milagro Mexicano\\" (the Mexican miracle). The Caribbean saw the beginnings of decolonization, while on the largest island the Cuban Revolution introduced Cold War rivalries into Latin America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe civil rights movement in the U.S. ended Jim Crow and empowered black voters in the 1960s, which allowed black citizens to move into high government offices for the first time since Reconstruction. However, the dominant New Deal coalition collapsed in the mid 1960s in disputes over race and the Vietnam War, and the conservative movement began its rise to power, as the once dominant liberalism weakened and collapsed. Canada during this era was dominated by the leadership of Pierre Elliot Trudeau. In 1982, at the end of his tenure, Canada enshrined a new constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada's Brian Mulroney not only ran on a similar platform but also favored closer trade ties with the United States. This led to the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement in January 1989. Mexican presidents Miguel de la Madrid, in the early 1980s and Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the late 1980s, started implementing liberal economic strategies that were seen as a good move. However, Mexico experienced a strong economic recession in 1982 and the Mexican peso suffered a devaluation. In the United States president Ronald Reagan attempted to move the United States back towards a hard anti-communist line in foreign affairs, in what his supporters saw as an attempt to assert moral leadership (compared to the Soviet Union) in the world community. Domestically, Reagan attempted to bring in a package of privatization and regulation to stimulate the economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end of the Cold War and the beginning of the era of sustained economic expansion coincided during the 1990s. On January 1, 1994, Canada, Mexico and the United States signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, creating the world's largest free trade area. In 2000, Vicente Fox became the first non-PRI candidate to win the Mexican presidency in over 70 years. The optimism of the 1990s was shattered by the 9/11 attacks of 2001 on the United States, which prompted military intervention in Afghanistan, which also involved Canada. Canada did not support the United States' later move to invade Iraq, however.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the U.S. the Reagan Era of conservative national policies, deregulation and tax cuts took control with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. By 2010, political scientists were debating whether the election of Barack Obama in 2008 represented an end of the Reagan Era, or was only a reaction against the bubble economy of the 2000s (decade), which burst in 2008 and became the Late-2000s recession with prolonged unemployment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the failure of a lasting political union, the concept of Central American reunification, though lacking enthusiasm from the leaders of the individual countries, rises from time to time. In 1856ÿ1857 the region successfully established a military coalition to repel an invasion by United States adventurer William Walker. Today, all five nations fly flags that retain the old federal motif of two outer blue bands bounding an inner white stripe. (Costa Rica, traditionally the least committed of the five to regional integration, modified its flag significantly in 1848 by darkening the blue and adding a double-wide inner red band, in honor of the French tricolor).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1907, a Central American Court of Justice was created. On December 13, 1960, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua established the Central American Common Market (\\"CACM\\"). Costa Rica, because of its relative economic prosperity and political stability, chose not to participate in the CACM. The goals for the CACM were to create greater political unification and success of import substitution industrialization policies. The project was an immediate economic success, but was abandoned after the 1969 \\"Football War\\" between El Salvador and Honduras. A Central American Parliament has operated, as a purely advisory body, since 1991. Costa Rica has repeatedly declined invitations to join the regional parliament, which seats deputies from the four other former members of the Union, as well as from Panama and the Dominican Republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay were overthrown or displaced by U.S.-aligned military dictatorships. These dictatorships detained tens of thousands of political prisoners, many of whom were tortured and/or killed (on inter-state collaboration, see Operation Condor). Economically, they began a transition to neoliberal economic policies. They placed their own actions within the United States Cold War doctrine of \\"National Security\\" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from an internal conflict (see T~pac Amaru Revolutionary Movement and Shining Path). Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships have been common, but starting in the 1980s a wave of democratization came through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now. Allegations of corruption remain common, and several nations have seen crises which have forced the resignation of their presidents, although normal civilian succession has continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational indebtedness became a notable problem, as most recently illustrated by Argentina's default in the early 21st century. In recent years, South American governments have drifted to the left, with socialist leaders being elected in Chile, Bolivia, Brazil, Venezuela, and a leftist president in Argentina and Uruguay. Despite the move to the left, South America is still largely capitalist. With the founding of the Union of South American Nations, South America has started down the road of economic integration, with plans for political integration in the European Union style.","input":"What is the oldest civilization in north america?"},{"output":"Yadier Benjamin Molina","context":"","input":"Who is the catcher for the st louis cardinals?"},{"output":"8 December 2017","context":"The Grand Tour is a British[2][3] motoring television series for Amazon Video, presented by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May, and produced by Andy Wilman.[4]\\r\\nThe four agreed to produce the series following their departures from the BBC series Top Gear with an initial agreement of 36 episodes over three years.[7][8] Episodes are scheduled to be released weekly to those with Amazon Prime Video accounts in the United Kingdom, United States, Germany, Austria[9] and Japan, beginning November 2016.[10][11][12]\\r\\nTent segments for the first series were filmed between 17 July and 11 December 2016,[13][14] and premiered on 18 November 2016. In the days following the launch it became Amazon Video's most watched premiere episode.[15] As of December 2016[update] the show was made available to an additional 195 countries and various territories.[16] Repeats of the first series began airing on traditional broadcasters in late 2017.[17]\\r\\nA teaser trailer for the second series was released on 11 July 2017, featuring a Mercedes AMG GT R, Ripsaw EV-2, McLaren 720S, Bugatti Chiron, Audi TT RS, Rimac Concept One, a Grumman American AA-5 light aircraft and an armoured personnel carrier visiting the Dubai Mall.[18] A second trailer, released on 1 November 2017, featured a Lamborghini Aventador S, Honda NSX, Ariel Nomad and Kia Stinger GT. The second series filmed its studio segments on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays between 25 October and 19 December 2017,[19] and premiered on 8 December 2017.[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intended format was initially for individual television films, using location shooting without studio segments, but after the title reveal it was announced that there will be studio segments shot in large tents at various locations.[22][23] Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos described the deal as being \\"very, very, very expensive\\".[24] W. Chump & Sons is the production company for the programme, and Amazon.com is distributing the show.\\r\\nStudio recording for the first series began in Johannesburg, South Africa on 17 July 2016.[25] Recording in the United States took place on 25 September 2016 in Southern California, with further recording taking place in Nashville on 21 November 2016.[26][27] Studio recording in the United Kingdom took place in Whitby on 13 October 2016,[28] with further recordings taking place at Loch Ness in December 2016. Further studio recording took place in Rotterdam on 22 October 2016 and Lapland on 3 November 2016.[29][30][31] Stuttgart (Ludwigsburg) was also a filming location.[32] The final studio filming took place in Dubai in December 2016.[33]\\r\\nFor the second series, due to Clarkson's Pneumonia and Hammond's car crash, it was decided that there would no longer be a travelling tent.[34][35] Instead the tent would be left in one location near Clarkson's home in the Cotswolds as this would be more convenient for the crew to operate. It also would be useful for new features such as Celebrity Face Off.[36]\\r\\nThe show has a dedicated test track called the \\"Eboladrome\\", at the former RAF Wroughton. Clarkson states in the first episode that the name is due to its shape resembling the structure of the Ebola virus.\\r\\nIt is designed to \\"trip cars up\\", according to Clarkson. Section names include the \\"Isn't Straight\\", \\"Your Name Here\\" (sponsored by Dental Care Swindon as of episode 2), \\"Old Lady's House\\", \\"Substation\\" and \\"Field of Sheep\\". In the first episode, the track was said to have been modified following the discovery of an unexploded Second World War bomb.\\r\\nCars are tested by British racing driver Abbie Eaton[1] (formerly NASCAR driver Mike Skinner, known as \\"The American\\"). According to the presenters, Amazon insisted the driver be an American, which is why Skinner was hired.[37] In November 2017 it was announced that Skinner would not return for the second series[38] and was replaced by Eaton.\\r\\nPrior to the airing of the first episode the lap-board had been pre-populated with ten lap-times by a selection of cars. The laps themselves were not shown, only their lap-times. The first car to be shown, with an on-screen lap-time, was a 2016 BMW M2 with a time of 1:26.2 set by Skinner. The Eboladrome is also used for general filming and testing by the presenters, meaning that other vehicles ÿ such as a Ferrari 488 used in episode one ÿ may appear on the track, but do not set a lap-time set by the racing driver.\\r\\nFor the second series, a new test track was created at Enstone Airfield, close to the fixed studio tent location, and which the production team had previously tried to use for Top Gear.[39] The main Eboladrome track was planned to continue to serve for the testing of loud and fast cars.[39]\\r\\nFollowing complaints regarding the \\"Celebrity Brain Crash\\" segment in the first series, this segment was replaced by \\"Celebrity Face Off\\". Two celebrities join the show each week, with a similar background or connection and from different countries, to see which one of the two is faster. The car used for this segment is a Jaguar F-Type coupe, racing around a half gravel, half asphalt track at Enstone.\\r\\nThe trio discuss car news. Running jokes include Hammond \\"oversharing\\" intimate personal information, and Clarkson being cut off after asking \\"Can I talk about...?\\" before either Hammond or May introduce the next segment; frequently, the subject he attempts to raise is Alfa Romeo and their new cars. The video introduction to the segment shows the men, in silhouette talking animatedly: in each episode the silhouettes change in various ways.\\r\\nThe first series included several running gags. During the opening titles of each episode, a camera drone was destroyed. From episode three onward, one of the presenters' names is always seen misspelt during the opening. For \\"Celebrity Brain Crash\\", celebrity guests are humorously \\"killed\\" in an accident while making their way to the tent. After each \\"death\\", May asks \\"Does that mean he/she's not coming on then?\\" to which Hammond deadpans \\"No James, they're not\\" while bluntly outlining how \\"dead\\" the celebrity is. This element of the show reflects the BBC's efforts to stop The Grand Tour from interviewing celebrity guests,[42] as had been the focus of the Top Gear \\"Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\\" segment.\\r\\nIt was announced on 16 November 2017 that both \\"The American\\" and \\"Celebrity Brain Crash\\" would not be returning and will be replaced for the second series as they had been being unpopular with the viewers.[43] The segment will be replaced by \\"Celebrity Face Off\\" in which celebrities compete for the best lap times around a new track in a Jaguar F-Type.[44]\\r\\nThe format of segments in the programme are a result of needing to ensure differentiation from the team's previous work on Top Gear for the BBC.[42][59] The show is presented from a pair of large tents on a Grand Tour around the world.[59] The presenters sit around a trestle table, with the studio audience seated in front of them.[59] The \\"Conversation Street\\" segment allows discussion of current events at the time of filming.[59] Lap times are shown on an electronic scoreboard.[59] A recurring test driver used for lap times is a named NASCAR character, portraying a stereotypical redneck accent and viewpoints, and prone to tangential speech.[59][60] Any celebrity guests booked for the \\"Celebrity Brain Crash\\" segment are shown being \\"killed off\\" before they can be interviewed by the presenters.[42]\\r\\nThe studio tent location varied during the first series. In September 2017 West Oxfordshire District Council gave planning permission for three months of filming from a fixed tent location on the Great Tew Estate near Chipping Norton.[61] Two-hundred parking spaces already used for hosting the Cornbury Music Festival on the same site would be used to accommodate 350 guests per week, plus 80 members of staff.[61] The time window allowed for the series 2 filming was between October and December 2017.[61]\\r\\nThe show's title was announced as The Grand Tour on 11 May 2016.[62] The show's logo was unveiled by Clarkson on Twitter on 28 June 2016.[63]\\r\\nThere was speculation that the show could be called Gear Knobs after a trademark application was made for that name by an associated company,[64] but Clarkson stated in October 2015 that this would not be the title.[65][66] He explained in April 2016 that the word \\"Gear\\" could not be used for legal reasons.[67]\\r\\nA short trailer was released on 8 April 2016 portraying Clarkson, Hammond and May brainstorming for a suitable name for the new series, before ending with the hashtag #TheStillVeryMuchUntitledClarksonHammondMayAmazonPrimeShowComingAutumn2016.[68]\\r\\nAnother short trailer was posted by Clarkson on Facebook, yet again portraying the trio attempting to conjure up a suitable name. But this time, they end up getting distracted and completely forgetting the task at hand. Shortly afterwards, the trailer was released on the Amazon Video UK YouTube channel.[69]\\r\\nUnited Broadcast Facilities (UBF) in The Netherlands won the contract for the outside broadcasting tent segments.[5] Fourteen microphones are used for recording the audience reaction laugh track within the tent.[5] The mobile studio audio setup uses Lawo mixing desks connected via MADI for live sound mixing, recording and talkback intercoms.[5]\\r\\nIn July 2016 following the completion of filming for The Grand Tour an offshore powerboat racing powerboat C-237 belonging to Sunus Racing was stopped in the San Marco basin and impounded by police near to San Zaccaria, Venice, for only having insurance during filming itself, and not afterwards.[70][71]\\r\\nFollowing the public naming of the show, Amazon offered new customers a S20 discount for their first year on Amazon Prime during 14ÿ16 May 2016.[72] A trailer announcing the release date of the show as 18 November 2016 was posted on the show's YouTube channel on 15 September 2016.[73] A second, full-length trailer, was released on 6 October 2016.[74] Trailers have used the music \\"Come with Me Now\\" by Kongos.[75]\\r\\nAs part of their marketing campaign, Amazon placed crashed Toyota Prius cars at Hackescher Markt in Berlin, in front of London King's Cross railway station, and on the Hollywood Walk of Fame outside the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.[76]\\r\\nIn mid-2016 DHL began sponsoring the transport costs of the tent and mobile studio.[77][78] In June 2016, in connection with the sponsorship deal, the presenters had uploaded videos of themselves attempting to assemble DHL-branded shipping boxes.[79] The first episode stated that \\"promotional consideration\\" had been given by the Breitling Jet Team, DHL and Samsung.[80] Eight of the Breitling Jet aircraft took part in the opening sequence flyovers.[81] For episode 2, the list included 5.11 Tactical.[82] A DHL Boeing 757 was featured in the opening sequence of episode 5, the tent was located in Rotterdam, and the DHL logo is featured on part of the crash barrier at the Eboladrome.\\r\\nAs of November 2016[update] the show has received positive reviews from critics,[83] with The Guardian saying \\"Jeremy Clarkson and co leave the BBC in their dust\\".[84]\\r\\nDaily Express TV reporter, Neela Debnath commented that the first episode \\"resembled a Hollywood blockbuster\\" and added that \\"[The Grand Tour is] basically Top Gear on steroids\\".[85] However, BBC Arts Editor, Will Gompertz said of the opening that \\"there is no irony. It feels uncomfortably hubristic\\" but once the presenters were in the tent \\"Normal service has been resumed\\" and that \\"It seemed to me that Grand Tour is a TV show that wants to be ÿ and quite possibly should be ÿ a movie\\"[86] The Independent described The Grand Tour as \\"the best of Top Gear but with a greater budget\\"[87] TheWrap reported an estimate by Symphony Advanced Media that the opening weekend viewer count for The Grand Tour was three times the size of the opening weekend of The Man in the High Castle.[88]\\r\\nEpisode 2 was somewhat less favourably received by fans and critics.

Clarkson, Hammond, and May's love for machinery... is still present, pure, and appealing, even with the shift in networks and formats.\\"[96]\\r\\nConversely, in April 2017 Brad Anderson of CarScoops stated that he prefers Top Gear to The Grand Tour. According to Anderson, Top Gear had \\"become even better\\", whereas the Grand Tour \\"seemed more scripted, less natural and at stages, forced... attention is often skewed away from the cars as the presenters, namely Clarkson, seemed to chase controversy and headlines\\". Anderson continues that in-studio segments became repetitive quickly, particularly \\"Celebrity Brain Crash\\", also noting that all three hosts seem to spend far too much time needling each other, and test driver Mike Skinner offers no worthwhile commentary.[97]\\r\\nOn the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season of The Grand Tour has a \\"fresh\\" rating of 86%, based on 7 reviews, with an average rating of 8.0/10.[98]\\r\\nDigital Spy was positive of season 2, episode 1, calling it \\"An understated premiere for a show that feels like it's finding its feet.\\"[99] The Times was also positive, giving the show 4 out of 5 stars, stating \\"Some parts of the show are flat but mostly it works, the production values remain high and it has clearly been hit with a juggernaut of money.\\" [100] The Daily Telegraph, while not as positive, still approved of the episode, stating \\"The writing is still rather ropey.

The song became very popular in the US in 1950 with no fewer than seven different versions reaching the Billboard charts. These were by Tony Martin, Paul Weston, Bing Crosby (recorded June 22, 1950),[3] Ralph Flanagan, Victor Young and Louis Armstrong.[4]\\r\\nA cover version in 1977 by Jamaican singer Grace Jones was also a successful international hit.[5] \\"La Vie en rose\\" has been covered by many other artists over the years, including a 1993 version by American singer Donna Summer. Harry James also recorded a version in 1950 on Columbia 38768. Bing Crosby recorded the song again for his 1953 album Le Bing: Song Hits of Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song's title can be translated as \\"Life in Rosy Hues\\" or \\"Life Through Rose-Tinted Glasses\\"; its literal meaning is \\"Life in Pink\\".[6]\\r\\nThe lyrics and melody of the song were written by dith Piaf herself, but the melody was said officially to have been composed and registered by Louiguy only, since at the time, due to the stringent registration requirements of SACEM, Piaf did not have the necessary qualifications to be able to copyright her work with SACEM.[7] Piaf offered the song to Marianne Michel, who slightly modified the lyrics, changing \\"les choses\\" (\\"things\\") for \\"la vie\\" (\\"life\\"). In 1943, Piaf had performed at a nightclub/bordello called \\"La Vie en Rose\\".[8] Initially, Piaf's peers and songwriting team did not think the song would be successful, finding it weaker than the rest of her repertoire. Heeding their advice, the singer put the song aside, only to change her mind the next year. The song was performed live in concert for the first time in 1946. It became a favorite with audiences.[7] \\"La Vie en rose\\" was the song that made Piaf internationally famous, with its lyrics telling about the joy of finding true love and appealing to those who had survived the difficult wartime.[9]\\r\\n\\"La Vie en rose\\" was released on a 10\\" single in 1947 by Columbia Records, a division of EMI, with \\"Un refrain courait dans la rue\\" making the B-side. It met with a warm reception and sold a million copies in the US.[10] It was the biggest-selling single of 1948 in Italy, and the ninth biggest-selling single in Brazil in 1949.[11] Piaf performed the song in the 1948 French movie Neuf gar?ons, un c?ur. The first of her albums to include \\"La Vie en rose\\" was the 10\\" Chansons parisiennes, released in 1950. The song appeared on most of Piaf's subsequent albums, and on numerous greatest hits compilations. It went on to become her signature song and her trademark hit, sitting with \\"Milord\\" and \\"Non, je ne regrette rien\\" among her best-known and most recognizable tunes. Encouraged by its success, Piaf wrote 80 more songs in her career.[7]\\r\\nEnglish lyrics were written by Mack David and numerous versions were recorded in the US in 1950. Those that charted were by Tony Martin (reached the No. 9 position in the Billboard charts), Paul Weston (No. 12 position), Bing Crosby (No. 13 position), Edith Piaf (No. 23 position), Ralph Flanagan (No. 27 position) and Victor Young (No. 27 position). Louis Armstrong recorded C'est si bon and La Vie en rose in New York City with Sy Oliver and his Orchestra on June 26, 1950[12] and this reached the No. 28 position in the Billboard charts.[13] Bing Crosby also recorded the song in French in 1953 for his album Le Bing: Song Hits of Paris.\\r\\nThe song received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998.[14]\\r\\nTwo films about Piaf named after the song's title have been produced. The first one, a 1998 documentary, used archive footage and interviews with Raquel Bitton, and was narrated by Bebe Neuwirth. The 2007 biographical feature film La Vie en Rose won Marion Cotillard an Academy Award for Best Actress for portraying Piaf in the film from childhood until her death at 47.[15]\\r\\nJamaican singer Grace Jones covered \\"La Vie en rose\\" in 1977 for her debut studio album Portfolio. It was the third and the last single off that album, and at the same time, her first single release on Island Records after having signed with the label.\\r\\nThe single version was heavily edited from its original album version being more than seven minutes long to a 3.5-minute track. Jones' fairly radical bossa nova interpretation of dith Piaf's signature tune became her first international hit single and a staple of her repertoire. It was later performed as part of her 1981 A One Man Show, then the only track from her disco era to be included in the show. In Spain and Mexico the track was billed as \\"La Vida en rosa\\" on the 7\\" single release, although it was not a Spanish version of the song. Jones' recording of \\"La Vie en rose\\" was later re-released a number of times in the early 1980s and finally reached #12 in the UK charts when re-released as a double A-side with \\"Pull Up to the Bumper\\" in 1985. The single was certified Gold in France and Italy.[19]\\r\\nGrace Jones about the song: \\"That's a very special song to me. Oh God, I cry every time I sing it. I had quite a few French lovers, so every time I sing it I think about them.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe music video for the song was made using the chroma key technique. It presents Grace dancing and singing the song with the famous 1978 montage picture of herself in the background, which was later used for the cover of her 1985 Island Life compilation. The video begins with Grace wearing a rose-patterned coat. Having removed it, the singer dances in a scant gold dress which reveals her right nipple as well as black underwear.\\r\\nAmerican singer Donna Summer covered \\"La Vie en rose\\" in 1993 for the tribute album called Tribute to Edith Piaf or Edith Piaf Tribute, on which several contemporary stars recorded interpretations of some of Piaf's best known songs. Released on both vinyl and CD, the American release of the album and single contain a different mix of Summer's synth-driven performance than the French release. These releases are among the most sought after of Summer's collectables.[citation needed] The U.S. single features a variety of remixes by DJ Chris Cox.","input":"Who sang the original la vie en rose?"},{"output":"66,027","context":"Johnson City is a city in Washington, Carter, and Sullivan counties in the U.S. state of Tennessee, with most of the city being in Washington County.

The MSA is also a component of the Johnson CityÿKingsportÿBristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area ÿ commonly known as the \\"Tri-Cities\\" region.  This CSA is the fifth-largest in Tennessee with an estimated 500,538 people in residence.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Bean, traditionally recognized as Tennessee's first colonizer, built his cabin along Boone's Creek near Johnson City in 1769.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1780s, Colonel John Tipton (1730ÿ1813) established a farm (now the Tipton-Haynes State Historic Site) just outside what is now Johnson City. During the State of Franklin movement, Tipton was a leader of the loyalist faction, residents of the region who wanted to remain part of North Carolina rather than form a separate state. In February 1788, an armed engagement took place at Tipton's farm between Tipton and his men and the forces led by John Sevier, the leader of the Franklin faction.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nFounded in 1856 by Henry Johnson as a railroad station called \\"Johnson's Depot\\"[15], Johnson City became a major rail hub for the Southeast, as three railway lines crossed in the downtown area.[16] In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Johnson City served as headquarters for the narrow gauge East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad (the ET&WNC, nicknamed \\"Tweetsie\\") and the standard gauge Clinchfield Railroad. Both rail systems featured excursion trips through scenic portions of the Blue Ridge Mountains and were engineering marvels of railway construction. The Southern Railway (now Norfolk Southern) also passes through the city.[citation needed][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the American Civil War, before it was formally incorporated in 1869, the name of the town was briefly changed to \\"Haynesville\\" in honor of Confederate Senator Landon Carter Haynes.[18] Henry Johnson's name was quickly restored following the war, with Johnson elected as the city's first mayor on January 3, 1870. The town grew rapidly from 1870 until 1890 as railroad and mining interests flourished. However, the national depression of 1893, which caused many railway failures (including the Charleston, Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad or \\"3-Cs\\", a predecessor of the Clinchfield) and a resulting financial panic, halted Johnson City's boom town momentum.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1901, the Mountain Branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers (now the U.S. Veterans Affairs Medical Center and National Cemetery), Mountain Home, Tennessee[20][21] was created by an act of Congress introduced by Walter P. Brownlow. Construction on this 450-acre (1.8?km2) campus, which was designed to serve disabled Civil War veterans, was completed in 1903 at a cost of $3 million. Before the completion of this facility, the assessed value of the entire town was listed at $750,000. The East Tennessee State Normal School was authorized in 1911 and the new college campus directly across from the National Soldiers Home.[citation needed] Johnson City began  growing rapidly and became the fifth-largest city in Tennessee by 1930.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether with neighboring Bristol, Johnson City was a hotbed for old-time music. It hosted noteworthy Columbia Records recording sessions in 1928 known as the Johnson City Sessions. Native son \\"Fiddlin' Charlie\\" Bowman became a national recording star via these sessions.[23] The Fountain Square area in downtown featured a host of local and traveling street entertainers including Blind Lemon Jefferson.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1920s and the Prohibition era, Johnson City's ties to the bootlegging activity of the Appalachian Mountains earned the city the nickname of \\"Little Chicago\\".[24] Stories persist that the town was one of several distribution centers for Chicago gang boss Al Capone during Prohibition. Capone had a well-organized distribution network within the southern United States for alcohol smuggling; it shipped his products from the mountain distillers to northern cities. Capone was, according to local lore, a part-time resident of Montrose Court, a luxury apartment complex now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many years, the city had a municipal \\"privilege tax\\" on carnival shows, in an attempt to dissuade traveling circuses and other transient entertainment businesses from doing business in town.[25] The use of drums by merchants to draw attention to their goods is prohibited. Title Six, Section 106 of the city's municipal code, the so-called \\"Barney Fife\\" ordinance, empowers the city's police force to draft into involuntary service as many of the town's citizens as necessary to aid police in making arrests and in preventing or quelling any riot, unlawful assembly or breach of peace.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohnson City is run by a five-person board of commissioners, who are as follows:[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city manager is M.

Cochlear implants bypass the normal acoustic hearing process, instead they replace it with electric hearing. Namely, the sound sensation comes from the sound that is converted to electric signals which directly stimulate the auditory nerve. The brain adapts to the new mode of hearing, and eventually can interpret the electric signals as sound and speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe implant has two main components. The outside component is generally worn behind the ear, but could also be attached to clothing, for example, in young children. This component, the sound processor, contains microphones, electronics that include DSP chips, battery, and a coil which transmits a signal to the implant across the skin.  The inside component, the actual implant, has a coil to receive signals, electronics, and an array of electrodes which is placed into the cochlea, which stimulate the cochlear nerve.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surgical procedure is performed under general anesthesia. Surgical risks are minimal but can include tinnitus and dizziness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the early days of implants in 70s and 80s, speech perception via an implant has steadily increased. Many users of modern implants gain reasonable to good hearing and speech perception skills post-implantation, especially when combined with lipreading.[1][2] One of the challenges that remains with these implants is that the range of hearing and speech understanding skills after implantation show a wide range across individual implant users. Factors such as duration and cause of hearing loss, how the implant is situated in the cochlea, the overall health of the cochlear nerve, but also individual capabilities of re-learning are considered to contribute to this variation, yet no certain predictive factors are known.[3][4][5] In children with severe to profound hearing loss, implants have shown to positively contribute to spoken language development.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite providing the ability for hearing and oral speech communication to children and adults with severe to profound hearing loss, there is also controversy around the devices. Much of the strongest objection to cochlear implants has come from the deaf community. For some in the deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which as some view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndr Djourno and Charles Eyris invented the original cochlear implant in 1957. This original design distributed stimulation using a single channel. Two years later they went their separate ways due to personal and professional differences (Svirsky M, 2017).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first cochlear implant was invented by Dr. William House, in 1961.[8]   In 1964, Blair Simmons and Robert J. White implanted a six channel electrode in a patient's cochlea at Stanford University.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern multichannel cochlear implant was independently developed and commercialized by Graeme Clark from Australia and Ingeborg Hochmair and her future husband, Erwin Hochmair, with the Hochmairs' first implanted in a person in December 1977 and Clark's in August 1978.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nCochlear implants bypass most of the peripheral auditory system which receives sound and converts that sound into movements of hair cells in the cochlea; the inside-portion of these hair cells release potassium ions in response to the movement of the hairs, and the potassium in turn stimulates other cells to release the neurotransmitter, glutamate, which makes the cochlear nerve send signals to the brain, which creates the experience of sound. Instead, the devices pick up sound and digitize it, convert that digitized sound into electrical signals, and transmit those signals to electrodes embedded in the cochlea. The electrodes electrically stimulate the cochlear nerve, causing it to send signals to the brain.[11][12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several systems available, but generally they have the following components:[11][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surgical procedure most often used to implant the device is called mastoidectomy with facial recess approach (MFRA).[13] If a person's individual anatomy prevents MFRA, other approaches, such as through the suprameatal triangle are used. A systematic literature review published in 2016 found that studies comparing the two approaches were generally small, not randomized, and retrospective so were not useful for making generalizations; it is not known which approach is safer or more effective.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe procedure is usually done under general anesthesia. Risks of the procedures include mastoiditis, otitis media (acute or with effusion), shifting of the implanted device requiring a second procedure, damage to the facial nerve, damage to the chorda tympani, and wound infections.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rate of complications is about 12% for minor complications and 3% for major complications; major complications include infections, facial paralysis, and device failure. To avoid the risk of bacterial meningitis, which while low is about thirty times as high compared to people who don't undergo CI procedures, the FDA recommends vaccination prior to the procedure. The rate of transient facial nerve palsy is estimated to be approximately 1%. Device failure requiring reimplantation is estimated to occur in 2.5-6% of the time. Up to one-third of people experience disequilibrium, vertigo, or vestibular weakness lasting more than 1 week after the procedure; in people under 70 these symptoms generally resolve over weeks to months, but in people over 70 the problems tend to persist.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nCochlear implants are only approved for people who are deaf in both ears; as of 2014 a cochlear implant had been used experimentally in some people who had acquired deafness in one ear after they had learned how to speak, and none who were deaf in one ear from birth; clinical studies as of 2014 had been too small to draw generalizations from.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2011 AHRQ review of the evidence of the effectiveness of CI in people with bilateral hearing loss - the device's primary use - found low to moderate quality data that showed speech perception in noisy conditions was much better for people who had implants in both ears done at the same time compared to people who had only one. The data also showed that no conclusions could be drawn about changes in speech perception in quiet conditions and health-related quality-of-life. There was only one good study comparing implanting implants in both ears at the same time to implanting them sequentially; this study found that in the sequential approach, the second implantation made no change, or made things worse.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2012 review found that the ability to communicate in spoken language was better the earlier the implantation was done. This review also found that, overall, the efficacy of cochlear implants is highly variable, and that it was not possible to accurately predict which children will and will not acquire spoken language successfully.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2015 review examined whether CI implantation to treat people with bilateral hearing loss had any effect on tinnitus. This review found the quality of evidence to be poor and the results variable: overall total tinnitus suppression rates varied from 8% to 45% of people who received CI; decrease of tinnitus was seen in 25% to 72%, of people; for 0% to 36% of the people there was no change; increase of tinnitus occurred in between 0% to 25% of patients; and, in between 0 and 10% of cases, people who did not have tinnitus before the procedure, got it.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2016 systematic review of CI for people with unilateral hearing loss (UHL) found that of the studies conducted and published, none were randomized, only one evaluated a control group, and no study was blinded. After eliminating multiple uses of the same subjects, the authors found that 137 people with UHL had received a CI.[19] While acknowledging the weakness of the data, the authors found that CI in people with UHL improves sound localization compared with other treatments in people who lost hearing after they learned to speak; in the one study that examined this, CI did improve sound localization in people with UHL who lost hearing before learning to speak.[19] It appeared to improve speech perception and to reduce tinnitus.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2015 literature review on the use of CI for people with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder found that, as of that date, description and diagnosis of the condition was too heterogeneous to make clear claims about whether CI is a safe and effective way to manage it.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of December 2012, approximately 324,000 cochlear implant devices had been surgically implanted. In the U.S., roughly 58,000 devices were implanted in adults and 38,000 in children.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the overall cost of getting cochlear implants was about $100,000 as of 2017.[21] Some or all of this may be covered by health insurance. In the United Kingdom, the NHS covers cochlear implants in full, as does Medicare in Australia, and the Department of Health[22] in Ireland, Seguridad Social in Spain and Israel, and the Ministry of Health or ACC (depending on the cause of deafness) in New Zealand. According to the US National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, the estimated total cost is $60,000 per person implanted.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA study by Johns Hopkins University determined that for a three-year-old child who receives them, cochlear implants can save $30,000 to $50,000 in special-education costs for elementary and secondary schools as the child is more likely to be mainstreamed in school and thus use fewer support services than similarly deaf children.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2013, the three cochlear implant devices approved for use in the U.S. were manufactured by Cochlear Limited (Australia), Advanced Bionics (a division of Sonova) and MED-EL (Austria). In Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, and Canada, an additional device manufactured by Neurelec (France, a division of William Demant) was available. A device made by Nurotron (China) was also available in some parts of the world. Each manufacturer has adapted some of the successful innovations of the other companies to its own devices. There is no consensus that any one of these implants is superior to the others. Users of all devices report a wide range of performance after implantation.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the strongest objection to cochlear implants has come from within the deaf community, some of whom are pre-lingually deaf people whose first language is a sign language. For some in the deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which, as they view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority.[7] This is an old problem for the deaf community, going back as far as the 18th century with the argument of manualism vs. oralism. This is consistent with medicalisation and the standardisation of the \\"normal\\" body in the 19th century, when differences between normal and abnormal began to be debated.[24] It is important to consider the sociocultural context, particularly in regards to the deaf community, which considers itself to possess its own unique language and culture.[25] This accounts for the cochlear implant being seen as an affront to their culture, as many do not believe that deafness is something that needs to be cured. However, it has also been argued that this does not necessarily have to be the case: the cochlear implant can act as a tool deaf people can use to access the \\"hearing world\\" without losing their deaf identity.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nCochlear implants for congenitally deaf children are considered to be most effective when implanted at a young age, during the critical period in which the brain is still learning to interpret sound.[26] Hence they are implanted before the recipients can decide for themselves, on the assumption that deafness is a disability. Deaf culture critics argue that the cochlear implant and the subsequent therapy often become the focus of the child's identity at the expense of a possible future deaf identity and ease of communication in sign language, and claim that measuring the child's success only by their mastery of hearing and speech will lead to a poor self-image as \\"disabled\\" (because the implants do not produce normal hearing) rather than having the healthy self-concept of a proudly deaf person.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren with cochlear implants are more likely to be educated orally, in the standard fashion, and without access to sign language and are often isolated from other deaf children and from sign language.[28] Cochlear implants have been one of the technological and social factors implicated in the decline of sign languages in the developed world.[29] Some of the more extreme responses from deaf activists have labeled the widespread implantation of children as \\"cultural genocide\\".[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the trend for cochlear implants in children grows, deaf-community advocates have tried to counter the \\"either or\\" formulation of oralism vs manualism with a \\"both and\\" approach; some schools are now successfully integrating cochlear implants with sign language in their educational programs.[31]","input":"Who developed and commercialised the modern multichannel cochlear implant (bionic ear)?"},{"output":"the Sahara desert","context":"North Africa is a collective term for a group of Mediterranean countries situated in the northern-most region of the African continent. The term \\"North Africa\\" has no single accepted definition. It is sometimes defined as stretching from the Atlantic shores of Morocco in the west, to the Suez Canal and the Red Sea in the east. Others have limited it to the countries of Morocco, Algeria, Libya, and Tunisia, a region known by the French during colonial times as Afrique du Nord and by the Arabs as the Maghreb (West). The most commonly accepted definition includes Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, as well as Libya and Egypt. It is important to note that the term North Africa, particularly when used in North Africa and the Middle East, often refers only to the countries of the Maghreb and Libya. Egypt, due to its greater Middle Eastern associations, is often considered separately.\\r\\nThe countries of North Africa share a common ethnic, cultural and linguistic identity that is unique to this region. North west Africa has been inhabited by Berbers since the beginning of recorded history, while the eastern part of North Africa has been home to the Egyptians. Following the Muslim conquest in the seventh century C.E., the region underwent a process of Arabization and Islamization that has defined its cultural landscape ever since.\\r\\nThe distinction between North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa is historically and ecologically significant because of the effective barrier created by the Sahara Desert for much of modern history. From 3500 BC, following the abrupt desertification of the Sahara due to gradual changes in the Earth's orbit, this barrier has culturally separated the North from the rest of the continent.[1] As the seafaring civilizations of the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Muslims and others facilitated communication and migration across the Mediterranean Sea, the cultures of North Africa became much more closely tied to Southwestern Asia and Europe than Sub-Saharan Africa. The Islamic influence in the area is also significant, and North Africa is a major part of the Muslim world.\\r\\nSome researchers have postulated that North Africa rather than East Africa served as the exit point for the modern humans who first trekked out of the continent in the Out of Africa migration.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Atlas Mountains extend across much of Morocco, northern Algeria and Tunisia, are part of the fold mountain system that also runs through much of Southern Europe. They recede to the south and east, becoming a steppe landscape before meeting the Sahara desert, which covers more than 75 percent of the region. The sediments of the Sahara overlie an ancient plateau of crystalline rock, some of which is more than four billion years old.\\r\\nSheltered valleys in the Atlas Mountains, the Nile Valley and Delta, and the Mediterranean coast are the main sources of fertile farming land. A wide variety of valuable crops including cereals, rice and cotton, and woods such as cedar and cork, are grown. Typical Mediterranean crops, such as olives, figs, dates and citrus fruits, also thrive in these areas. The Nile Valley is particularly fertile, and most of the population in Egypt live close to the river. Elsewhere, irrigation is essential to improve crop yields on the desert margins.\\r\\nSource:\\r\\nThe inhabitants of North Africa are roughly divided in a manner corresponding to the principal geographic regions of North Africa: the Maghreb, the Nile valley, and the Sahel. The Maghreb or western North Africa on the whole is believed to have been inhabited by Berbers since at least 10,000 B.C.,[8] while the eastern part of North Africa or the Nile Valley has mainly been home to the Egyptians. The edge of the Sahel, to the south of Egypt has mainly been inhabited by Nubians. Ancient Egyptians record extensive contact in their Western desert with people that appear to have been Berber or proto-Berber, as well as Nubians from the south. As the Tassili n'Ajjer and other rock art findings in the Sahara have shown, the Sahara also hosted various populations before its rapid desertification in 3500 B.C and even today continues to host small populations of nomadic trans-Saharan peoples.\\r\\nIn the eleventh century, the Banu Hilal invaded the North African plains and plateaus, but not the mountains (Rif, Kabylie or Aures) and brought with them Hilalian dialects of Arabic, which over the centuries have been in significant contact with other languages, including the languages of Europe. They have contributed to the Arabized Berber populations.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe official language or one of the official languages in all of the countries in North Africa is Arabic. Today, the largest ethnic groups in North Africa are Arabs, Berbers and West Africas. The region is predominantly Muslim with a Jewish minority in Morocco and Tunisia and significant Christian minoritythe Coptsin Egypt, Algeria,[9] Morocco[10] and Tunisia.[11]\\r\\nThe people of the Maghreb and the Sahara regions speak Berber languages and several varieties of Arabic and almost exclusively follow Islam. The Arabic and Berber languages are distantly related, both being members of the Afroasiatic language family. The Tuareg Berber languages are notably more conservative than those of the coastal cities.\\r\\nOver the years, Berbers have been influenced by contact with other cultures: Greeks, Phoenicians, Egyptians, Romans, Vandals, Arabs, Europeans and native Africans. The cultures of the Maghreb and the Sahara therefore combine indigenous Berber, Arab and elements from neighboring parts of Africa and beyond. In the Sahara, the distinction between sedentary oasis inhabitants and nomadic Bedouins and Tuaregs is particularly marked.\\r\\nThe diverse peoples of the Sahara are usually categorized along ethno-linguistic lines. In the Maghreb, where Arab and Berber identities are often integrated, these lines can be blurred. Some Berber-speaking North Africans may identify as \\"Arab\\" depending on the social and political circumstances, although substantial numbers of Berbers (or Amazighen) have retained a distinct cultural identity which in the 20th century has been expressed as a clear ethnic identification with Berber history and language. Arabic-speaking Northwest Africans, regardless of ethnic background, often identify with Arab history and culture and may share a common vision with other Arabs. This, however, may or may not exclude pride in and identification with Berber and/or other parts of their heritage. Berber political and cultural activists for their part, often referred to as Berberists, may view all Northwest Africans as principally Berber, whether they are primarily Berber- or Arabic-speaking.\\r\\nEgyptians over the centuries have shifted their language from Egyptian (in its late form, varieties of Coptic) to modern Egyptian Arabic while retaining a sense of national identity that has historically set them apart from other people in the region. Most Egyptians are Sunni Muslim, although there is a significant minority of Copts.\\r\\nThe Maghreb formerly had a significant Jewish population, almost all of whom emigrated to France or Israel when the North African nations gained independence. Prior to the modern establishment of Israel, there were about 600,000-700,000 Jews in Northern Africa, including both Sephardi Jews (refugees from France, Spain and Portugal from the Renaissance era) as well as indigenous Mizrahi Jews. Today, less than fifteen thousand remain in the region, almost all in Morocco and Tunisia, and are mostly part of a French-speaking urban elite. (See Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries.)\\r\\nDue to the recent African origin of modern humans, the history of Prehistoric North Africa is important to the understanding of pre-hominid and early modern human history in Africa. The earliest inhabitants of central North Africa have left behind significant remains: early remnants of hominid occupation in North Africa, for example, were found in Ain el Hanech, near Sa?da (c. 200,000 BCE); in fact, more recent investigations have found signs of Oldowan technology there, and indicate a date of up to 1.8 million BC.[12]\\r\\nThe cave paintings found at Tassili n'Ajjer, north of Tamanrasset, Algeria, and at other locations depict vibrant and vivid scenes of everyday life in central North Africa during the Neolithic Subpluvial period (about 8000 to 4000 BCE). Some parts of North Africa began to participate in the Neolithic revolution in the 6th millennium BC, just before the rapid desertification of the Sahara around 3500 B.C. due to a tilt in the Earth's orbit.[1]\\r\\nWhile Egypt and Sudan due to the early civilizations of Ancient Egypt and Nubia entered historicity by the Bronze Age, the Maghreb remained in the prehistoric period longer. Some Phoenician and Greek colonies were established along the Mediterranean coast during the 7th century BC.\\r\\nThe most notable nations of antiquity in western North Africa are Carthage and Numidia. The Phoenicians colonized much of North Africa including Carthage and parts of present-day Morocco (including Chellah, Essaouira and Volubilis[13]). The Carthaginians were of Phoenician origin, with the Roman myth of their origin being that Dido, a Phoenician princess, was granted land by a local ruler based on how much land she could cover with a piece of cowhide. She ingeniously devised a method to extend the cowhide to a high proportion, thus gaining a large territory. She was also rejected by the Trojan prince Aeneas according to Virgil, thus creating a historical enmity between Carthage and Rome, as Aeneas would eventually lay the foundations for Rome. Ancient Carthage was a commercial power and had a strong navy, but relied on mercenaries for land soldiers. The Carthaginians developed an empire in the Iberian Peninsula and Sicily, the latter being the cause of First Punic War with the Romans.\\r\\nOver a hundred years and more, all Carthaginian territory was eventually conquered by the Romans, resulting in the Carthaginian North African territories becoming the Roman province of Africa in 146 B.C.[14] This led to tension and eventually conflict between Numidia and Rome. The Numidian wars are notable for launching the careers of both Gaius Marius, and Sulla, and stretching the constitutional burden of the Roman republic, as Marius required a professional army, something previously contrary to Roman values to overcome the talented military leader Jugurtha.[15]\\r\\nNorth Africa remained a part of the Roman Empire, which produced many notable citizens such as Augustine of Hippo, until incompetent leadership from Roman commanders in the early fifth century allowed the Germanic peoples, the Vandals, to cross the Strait of Gibraltar, whereupon they overcame the fickle Roman defense. The loss of North Africa is considered a pinnacle point in the fall of the Western Roman Empire as Africa had previously been an important grain province that maintained Roman prosperity despite the barbarian incursions, and the wealth required to create new armies. The issue of regaining North Africa became paramount to the Western Empire, but was frustrated by Vandal victories. The focus of Roman energy had to be on the emerging threat of the Huns. In 468 AD, the Romans made one last serious attempt to invade North Africa but were repelled. This perhaps marks the point of terminal decline for the Western Roman Empire. The last Roman emperor was deposed in 476 by the Heruli general Odoacer. Trade routes between Europe and North Africa remained intact until the coming of Islam. Some Berbers were members of the Early African Church (but evolved their own Donatist doctrine),[16] some were Berber Jews, and some adhered to traditional Berber religion. African pope Victor I served during the reign of Roman emperor Septimius Severus\\r\\nThe early Muslim conquests included North Africa by 640. By 670, most of North Africa had come under Muslim rule. Indigenous Berbers subsequently started to form their own polities in response in places such as Fez and Sijilmasa. In the eleventh century, a reformist movement made up of members that called themselves the Almoravid dynasty expanded south into Sub-Saharan Africa.\\r\\nNorth Africa's populous and flourishing civilization collapsed after exhausting its resources in internal fighting and suffering devastation from the invasion of the Banu Sulaym and Banu Hilal. Ibn Khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.[18]\\r\\nAfter the Middle Ages the area was loosely under the control of the Ottoman Empire, except Morocco. The Spanish Empire conquered several coastal cities between the 16th and 18th centuries. After the 19th century, the imperial and colonial presence of France, the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy left the entirety of the region under one form of European occupation.\\r\\nIn World War II from 1940 to 1943 the area was the setting for the North African Campaign. During the 1950s and 1960s all of the North African states gained independence. There remains a dispute over Western Sahara between Morocco and the Algerian-backed Polisario Front.\\r\\nIn 2010 - 2011 massive protests swept the region leading to the overthrow of the governments in Tunisia and Egypt, as well as civil war in Libya. Large protests also occurred in Algeria and Morocco to a lesser extent. Many hundreds died in the uprisings.[19]\\r\\nThe economies of Algeria and Libya were transformed by the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves in the deserts. Morocco's major exports are phosphates and agricultural produce, and as in Egypt and Tunisia, the tourist industry is essential to the economy. Egypt has the most varied industrial base, importing technology to develop electronics and engineering industries, and maintaining the reputation of its high-quality cotton textiles.\\r\\nOil rigs are scattered throughout the deserts of Libya and Algeria. Libyan oil is especially prized because of its low sulfur content, which means it produces much less pollution than other fuel oils.","input":"What major desert encompasses most of northern africa?"},{"output":"Blackie Parrish","context":"John Phillip Stamos (/?ste?mo?s/ STAY-mohss; born August 19, 1963)[1] is an American actor, producer, and musician.

He is known for his work in television, especially in his starring role as Jesse Katsopolis on the ABC sitcom Full House. Since the show's finale in 1995, Stamos has appeared in numerous TV films and series. Since 2005, he has been the national spokesperson for Project Cuddle.[2]\\r\\nFrom 2005 to 2009, Stamos had a starring role on the NBC medical drama ER as Dr. Tony Gates. In September 2009, he began playing the role of Albert in the Broadway revival of Bye Bye Birdie. From September 2015 to 2016, Stamos starred as the lead character in the Fox sitcom Grandfathered. As of 2016, he is an executive producer of the Netflix series Fuller House, in which he occasionally reprises the role of Jesse Katsopolis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Stamos was born on August 19, 1963 in Cypress, CA to Loretta (nee Phillips) and William \\"Bill\\" Stamos.[3] Bill was a restaurateur originally from Greece, who changed his family name from Stamotopoulos to Stamos on emigrating to America. John is the eldest of three children. He has two sisters, Alana and Janeen.\\r\\nIn his youth Stamos worked for his father's restaurants, and as a teenager had a job flipping burgers in the Orange County area. He attended John F. Kennedy High School and played in the marching band there. At 15 he attended his first Beach Boys concert; a huge fan, he would later tour with the band. His parents were supportive of his aspiration to be an actor and although he planned to enroll at Cypress College for the 1981 term, with his father's blessing he skipped his first semester to focus on launching a career as an actor. After just three weeks he landed his first role on General Hospital.[4]\\r\\nStamos began his acting career with the role of Blackie Parrish on the soap opera General Hospital in late January 1982, for which he was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in 1984. That April, he went on to the lead role in the short-lived CBS sitcom Dreams, in which he played an aspiring musician in a band of the same name. Later, he played a cast role in the sitcom You Again? (1986) with Jack Klugman.\\r\\nIn the late 1980s, ABC's Full House gradually became a hit, and the show solidified Stamos's career. He asked that the character's last name be Katsopolis to highlight his Greek heritage, according to show creator and executive producer Jeff Franklin. He played one of the show's protagonists, Jesse, who lives with his brother-in-law, whose deceased wife was Jesse's older sister. Danny's best friend, Joey, also lives in the house with them. The three help each other raise three young girls. Jesse is known to be the \\"bad boy\\" at first until he falls in love with and marries Rebecca Donaldson and has twin boys, Nicky and Alex.

Three of The Beach Boys members are however briefly shown singing harmonies with Stamos: Carl Wilson, Bruce Johnston, and Mike Love.\\r\\nSince the 1990s, Stamos has regularly performed with The Beach Boys, such as during their summer tours, playing drums and guitar, and singing along on some of their hit songs, like \\"Forever\\", including:\\r\\nStamos began dating model/actress Rebecca Romijn in 1994 after they met at a Victoria's Secret fashion show in which she was modeling. Stamos and Romijn became engaged on Christmas Eve 1997, and they married on September 19, 1998, at the Beverly Hills Hotel.[34] They announced their separation in April 2004.[35] Stamos filed for divorce in August 2004,[36] and it became final on March 1, 2005.[37]\\r\\nOn October 23, 2017, John Stamos announced his engagement to Caitlin McHugh. [38]","input":"What character did john stamos play on general hospital?"},{"output":"SimCity BuildIt","context":"SimCity is an open-ended city-building video game series originally designed by developer Will Wright. Developed in Orinda, California, it is published by Maxis (now a division of Electronic Arts) and has spawned several different editions that have sold worldwide, with the first game in the series, SimCity, published in 1989. The ongoing success of SimCity has also sparked the release of many other spin-off \\"Sim\\" titles, including 2000's The Sims, one of the best-selling computer games.[1]\\r\\nIn the SimCity games, the player is given the task of founding and developing a city from a patch of green land, defining what buildings are constructed via development zones; residential zones for Sims to live in; commercial zones for Sims to shop and have offices within; industrial zones to provide work through factories, laboratories and farms - as well as ensuring their citizens are kept happy through establishing various services and amenities, all while keeping a stable budget. Since SimCity 2000, players are able to define zones by densities - low density for small buildings, medium density for low to mid-sized buildings, and high density for anything up to large tower blocks. SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, and SimCity 4 allow the player to alter the terrain of the city before building upon it. SimCity's game mechanics are based on 20th century California development, with each edition featuring similar gameplay elements. Players start from an undeveloped greenfield, cars are the default form of transportation, and earthquakes happen - but with some differences in what buildings, disasters and elements of city management are available.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe player (acting as mayor) is given a blank map to begin and must expand the city with the budget provided. As the city matures, the player may get to place government and other special buildings (such as a mayor's house or courthouse), depending on how large the city is. The player must supply the citizens services, which include health, education, safety, parks and leisure. These come in the form of different buildings, where each building covers a circular \\"range\\" of service. Inadequate funding of these services can lead to strikes.\\r\\nCities must also provide basic utilities, namely electricity, water and (in SimCity 3000 and SimCity 4) waste management.\\r\\nThe primary source of income is taxation, which can be altered by one percent increments in all versions up to SimCity 3000, and by tenths of a percent in SimCity 4. Legalizing gambling and placing certain \\"special\\" buildings (such as military bases or federal prisons) can generate income as well. The player may also make deals with neighbouring cities to sell or buy services, as long as a connection is made to the neighbor for that service (this feature was introduced in SimCity 3000).\\r\\nSimCity is predominantly a single-player game (the exceptions being a \\"Network Edition\\" of SimCity 2000, and a Unix port of the original SimCity).[2] SimCity 4 also provides a form of multiplayer gaming with the ability to share regional maps and cities with other players, allowing players to collaborate, but not to interact in real time gameplay.[3] [4] [5]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimCity was published in 1989, and was the first game in the SimCity series.[6] SimCity was originally developed by game designer Will Wright. The inspiration for SimCity came from a feature of the game Raid on Bungeling Bay that allowed Wright to create his own maps during development. Wright soon found he enjoyed creating maps more than playing the actual game, and so the idea for SimCity was created.[7] While developing SimCity, Wright cultivated a real love of the intricacies and theories of urban planning[8] and acknowledges the influence of System Dynamics which was developed by Jay Wright Forrester and whose book on the subject[9] laid the foundations for the simulation.[10] In addition, Wright also was inspired by reading \\"The Seventh Sally\\", a short story by Stanis?aw Lem from The Cyberiad, published in the collection The Mind's I, in which an engineer encounters a deposed tyrant, and creates a miniature city with artificial citizens for the tyrant to oppress.[11]\\r\\nThe first version of the game was developed for the Commodore 64 in 1985, but it would not be published for another four years.[12] The original working title of SimCity was Micropolis.[13] The game represented an unusual paradigm in computer gaming, in that it could neither be won nor lost; as a result, game publishers did not believe it was possible to market and sell such a game successfully. Br?derbund declined to publish the title when Wright proposed it, and he pitched it to a range of major game publishers without success. Finally, founder Jeff Braun of then-tiny Maxis agreed to publish SimCity as one of two initial games for the company.\\r\\nWright and Braun returned to Br?derbund to formally clear the rights to the game in 1988, when SimCity was near completion. Br?derbund executives Gary Carlston and Don Daglow saw that the title was infectious and fun, and signed Maxis to a distribution deal for both of its initial games. With that, four years after initial development, SimCity was released for the Amiga and Macintosh platforms, followed by the IBM PC and Commodore 64 later in 1989.[12]\\r\\nSim City was released in 1990 on the ZX Spectrum 48K & 128K by Infrogrames, programmed by Probe Software Ltd - Antony R. Lill, Simon Butler.\\r\\nOn January 10, 2008, the SimCity source code was released under the free software GPL 3 license.[14] The release of the source code was related to the donation of SimCity software to the One Laptop Per Child laptop, as one of the principles of the OLPC laptop is the use of free and open source software. The open source version will be called Micropolis (the initial name for SimCity), since EA retains the trademark SimCity. The version shipped on OLPC laptops will still be called SimCity, but will have to be tested by EA quality assurance before each release to be able to use that name.\\r\\nThe unexpected and enduring success of the original SimCity, combined with other \\"Sim\\" titles' relative lack of success at the time, motivated the development of a sequel. SimCity 2000 (SC2K), released in 1993,[15] was a major extension. The view was now isometric instead of overhead, the landscape was not flat, and underground layers were introduced for water pipes and subways.\\r\\nNew types of facility included prisons, schools, libraries, museums, marinas, zoos, stadiums, hospitals (although they appeared randomly on residential blocks in the first SimCity, they could not be built by the player) and arcologies. Players could build highways, roads, bus depots, railway tracks, subways, train depots and zone land for seaports and airports. There are a total of nine varieties of power plants in SC2K, including coal, natural gas, wind turbines, hydroelectric dams (which can only be placed on waterfall tiles) and the futuristic fusion power and satellite microwave plant.\\r\\nThe budget and finance controls are also much more elaboratetax rates can be set individually for residential, commercial and industrial zones. Enacting city ordinances and connecting to neighboring cities became possible.\\r\\nAnother new addition in SC2K is the query tool. Using the query tool on tiles reveals information such as structure name and type, altitude, and land value. Certain tiles also display additional information; power plants, for example, display the percentage of power being consumed when queried, and querying roads displays the amount of traffic on that tile. Querying a library and selecting 'Ruminate' displays an essay written by Neil Gaiman.\\r\\nGraphics were added for buildings under construction in the residential, commercial, and industrial zones, as well as darkened buildings depicting abandoned buildings as a result of urban decay.\\r\\nNews comes in the form of several pre-written newspaper articles with variable names that could either be called up immediately or could be subscribed to on a yearly basis. The newspaper option provided many humorous stories as well as relevant ones, such as new technology, warnings about aging power plant, recent disasters and opinion polls (highlighting city problems). SimCity 2000 is the only game in the entire series to have this feature (besides the discontinued children's version, SimTown), though newer versions have a news ticker. The newspapers had random titles (Times, Post, Herald, etc.), and prices based on the simulated year. Certain newspapers have a special monthly humor advice column by \\"Miss Sim\\".[16]\\r\\nThe successor to SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000 (SC3K) was released in 1999. It introduced many changes both to the city management and to the appearance.\\r\\nIn a pattern which has continued throughout the SimCity franchise, the number and complexity of city services increased between SC2K and SC3K. The issue of waste management was added: once a city has a population greater than 1,000, refuse would begin to accumulate and would have to be disposed of at the expense of the city; in previous versions of SimCity, this issue had been ignored. Farms and agriculture were also introduced, and appeared on large light industrial zones in a city with low land value and little pollution. In Sim City 3000, there are three zoning densities compared to the two densities used in SC2K. In addition to their limited life span, power plants are now vulnerable to decreasing maximum output at a constant rate after they have gone through about three quarters of their life span.\\r\\nAlthough the concept of neighbor cities was introduced in SC2K, its role was expanded in SC3K. For the first time, the player could interact with his or her neighbor cities, negotiating rudimentary business deals with other mayors, such as the sale or purchase of water, electricity, or waste management services. These generate a monthly charge which is either added to or subtracted from the player's treasury, in accordance with the deal. Canceling a neighbor deal will incur a substantial cash penalty. From time to time, the simulated mayors of neighboring cities will call meetings to renegotiate the terms or price of these deals.\\r\\nAlthough not strictly a city management aspect, SimCity 3000 simulated the effect of land value on construction much more realistically than in SimCity 2000. In the latter, most buildings fell into a wide stratum that did not reflect land value very effectively; every building was more or less suited to neighborhoods of every economic disposition. In SC3K, land value created distinct neighborhoods which tended to contain narrow income bands, creating well-defined slums, middle class areas, and wealthy areas. Land value is also determined by the city center effect where buildings that are at the city center have higher land values and those buildings on the borders have lower land values. The city center effect is determined by the location of buildings within the city. However, over time, land value \\"inflation\\" would cause almost every area of a city to become expensive, so that wealthy neighborhoods covered most if not all of the map.\\r\\nBusiness deals were another new concept to SC3K. By allowing certain structures to be built within the city, the player could receive a substantial amount of funds from them. The four business deal structures are the maximum security prison, casino, toxic waste conversion plant, and the Gigamall (a large shopping center). Business deal structures however have serious negative effects on a city. The toxic waste dump lowers both the land value and residential desirability in the area surrounding it and produces massive pollution. The prison dramatically decreases land value. The casino increases citywide crime and the Gigamall weakens demand for local commerce.\\r\\nThere were several changes to the graphical interface in SC3K. Although the game retained the pseudo-isometric dimetric perspective of its predecessor, the actual landscape became more complex and colorful. In SimCity and SC2K, the playable landscape was brown, like the color of bare dirt. In SC3K, the playable landscape was a more realistic green color, simulating grassland, along with other colors that progressively change by height, from beige (beach sand) to green to brown (bare ground) to white (snow). In SC2K, land could either be flat or sloped, and all slopes were of the same steepness. In SC3K, there were five distinct steepness of slope, creating more varied landscapes. However, in SC3K, there are no waterfalls and hydroelectric dams, which are common in SC2K. Also, for the first time, there were different types of trees which could appear on the playable map. In SC2K, there were only pine trees, while in SC3K, oak trees prevail, but other types of trees exist, depending on the elevation of the terrain.[4]\\r\\nSimCity 4 was released on January 14, 2003. As with previous SimCity titles, SimCity 4 (Sim4) places the player in the role of a mayor (or several mayors), tasked with populating and developing tracts of lands into cities, while fulfilling the needs of fellow Sims who live there. Cities are now located in regions, which are divided into segments, each of which can be developed. Each region represents the metropolitan area of a city, while individual cities represent districts. The player has the option of starting the city in a segment of any of three area sizes; in actual measurement the smallest has a length of 1 kilometer on a side, and the largest has a length of 4 kilometers on a side.[17] A large city is 16?km2; for comparison the New York borough of Manhattan measures about 60?km2. The size of a region and its layout of segments can be changed in a bitmap file provided for each region.\\r\\nZoning and building size have been improved for SimCity 4. Agriculture is now a separate industrial zone-type, allowing farms to grow regardless of high land value, so long as there exists demand for agriculture and agricultural zones have been provided. Zones are now automatically aligned towards roads; streets are automatically created in a grid formation when zoning on tracts of land. Buildings are now classified into several wealth levels, zone types, and building size stages, which are affected by the region's population and the city's condition. The game simulates urban decay and gentrification with buildings deteriorating or improving accordingly. Buildings originally constructed for occupation by higher wealth tenants can now support lower wealth tenants in the event surrounding factors forces the current tenants to vacate the building; this allows certain buildings to remain in use despite lacking its initial occupants. Buildings and lots can now be constructed on slopes.\\r\\nSimCity 4 can be used in conjunction with The Sims. Sims can be imported into a city for use in the My sim mode. City layouts created in SimCity 4 can be used as neighborhood templates in The Sims 2; the location of roads, trees, bridges, and map features such as rivers and hills are preserved in the importation.[18]\\r\\nReleased in 2007, the gameplay of SimCity Societies is significantly different from previous SimCity titles, with a greater focus on \\"social engineering\\".[19]\\r\\nPublic works and a tax system do not play a part in the game. Instead, players get daily income from workplaces in the city. Transportation networks have been reduced to dirt roads, paved roads, subways and bus stops. Players do not build zones, a key element of past SimCity games; instead, they have the ability to directly place individual buildings, something not seen in previous editions, and similar to Monte Cristo's game City Life. There are also six \\"social energies\\", called societal values, which allow players to learn about the characteristics of the citizens. The six societal values are productivity, prosperity, creativity, spirituality, authority, and knowledge.[20] The city will look, and act, in accordance with the energies the players choose. Players may focus on satisfying one, several, or all of these values. An improved version of the reward system introduced in SimCity 2000 has been included in the game.[21]\\r\\nThe game is \\"fully customizable\\" and allows the players to customize individual buildings, decorations, citizens, and game rules.[22] Prior to its release, when mentioning the depth to which the game will allow customization, a Tilted Mill representative stated that those who were proficient in C# and XML will have easy access to every asset of the game and that basic tools would be provided for building editing.[23]\\r\\nSimCity's sixth major release was announced on March 5, 2012 for Windows and Mac OS X by Maxis at the \\"game changers\\" event.[24] The game was released for Windows on March 5, 2013.[25] A download-only Mac version was released in August 2013 available for digital download on Origin.[26][27]\\r\\nIt was a dramatic departure from previous SimCity games, featuring full 3D graphics, online multiplayer gameplay, the new Glassbox engine, as well as many other feature and gameplay changes.\\r\\nThe game launch was plagued by connection errors for many users, and this aspect of the game was heavily criticized in user reviews. EA announced that they would offer a free game from their library to all those who bought SimCity as compensation for the problems, and they concurred that the way the launch had been set up was \\"dumb\\".[28] As a result of this problem, Amazon temporarily stopped selling the game in the week after release.[29]\\r\\nEA came furthermore under fire, as the game as released in 2013 required an internet connection to even play the singleplayer mode; however, reports surfaced that the internet connection requirement could be easily removed.[30] According to a blog post in October 2013 by Maxis Emeryville General Manager, Patrick Buechner, the team was considering an offline mode, which would allow for mod support.[31] An offline mode for SimCity was subsequently made available by EA in March 2014.[32][33][34]\\r\\nSimCity 2013 was additionally criticized for its very small maximum city size of 4?km2, one quarter the size of previous versions. EA has announced that they would not increase the city size in the near future.[35]\\r\\nThe SNES port of SimCity is very similar to the original edition, but has some unique features. Reward buildings can be built as they are given to a mayor, like a mayor's mansion and a casino. A monster that sometimes attacks cities or is released upon cities by their mayor is Bowser from the popular Nintendo game series, Super Mario Bros. (1985). When a player achieves megalopolis status they are gifted a Mario statue.\\r\\nAlthough general gameplay in SimCity 64 is much like SimCity 2000, the game's graphical textures and building tilesets are considerably different. However, the game provides several advanced features that were not seen in either SimCity 2000 or SimCity 3000 (1999), including the ability to view the city at night (now also available in SimCity 4), pedestrian level free-roaming of a city, and individual road vehicles and pedestrians (which could only be seen while in the free-roaming mode). Cities in the game are also presented in 3D hybrid graphics.\\r\\nSimCity Creator is title for the Wii and Nintendo DS that was first announced on February 12, 2008, by Sims label president Nancy Smithalong with other upcoming EA Sim titles.[36] The title features the ability to directly draw roads and train tracks on the ground using the pointer function of the Wii Remote, as well as several customizable themes for the city's buildings.[37] It was released worldwide for the Wii in September 2008.[37][38]\\r\\nSimCity DS is a heavily modified version of SimCity 3000. The game inherits SC3K's graphics, but makes use of the handheld's dual screen to display additional interfaces at once. System specific features are also prominent, such as the use of the systems' integrated microphone, which is used to blow out fires, and the touch screen, which is used to control the interface. Before beginning a city the player must first choose a location in the region, one of five different advisors and then sign the town charter using the touchscreen and stylus. The upper screen of the DS displays the city and the news ticker while the map, advisor, information and the buttons are shown on the touch screen.[39]\\r\\nSimCity DS features five advisors who help players make decisions in the game by providing recommendations and advice. As opposed to previous versions of SimCity, the player must choose only one advisor to help them when they sign the town charter. The different advisors include Mr. Maxis (A Will Wright cameo),[citation needed] Julie McSim, Ayako Tachibana, Kaishu Tachibana, Servo 3000 and a secret advisor named Alien.\\r\\nThere are also petitioners, many of whom are citizens of the players' cities, who request solutions to problems and changes to city policies, such as lowering tax rates or enacting an ordinance. They may also give the player rewards or request certain structures to be erected in the city.[40]\\r\\nSimCity DS 2 is a game for the Nintendo DS video game console and is the sequel to SimCity DS. It was released in Japan on March 19, 2008, and was released in the West in September 2008 under the name SimCity Creator.[37] The game introduces a new Challenge Mode that sees players guide their city through different historical periods. Because of this, it is also possible to create cities with a historical theme. For instance, the player can create a medieval city, or a pre-historic city.[41]\\r\\nA version of SimCity 3000, known simply as SimCity, was released in 2008 for the iPhone and iPod Touch. This version lacks some of the greater details seen in the series. It is a simple version of the other games in the more recent SimCity series. It is no longer offered on the iTunes App Store.\\r\\nSimCity Deluxe was released in July 2010 for iPhone as well as Android. It is an improved SimCity 3000 with SimCity 4 buildings. It has improved graphics and an improved interface over the earlier iPhone version of SimCity. On July 29, 2010, the game made its debut on the App Store for iPhone, iPod touch, and SimCity Deluxe HD for iPad.[42] The version is considerably similar to the desktop version, however still lacking several of the key features seen on the desktop version such as God Mode and My Sim mode. This version is no longer available on Apple's iTunes App Store.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis version of SimCity 4 for the Playbook was released on October 10, 2011.[43] This is the same game initially released for the iPad, known as SimCity Deluxe HD.[44]\\r\\nSimCity Classic is an online browser-based version of the first SimCity.[45] It was established in 2008 by Maxis.\\r\\nSimCity BuildIt is a remake of SimCity 2013 for iOS and Android mobile devices.[46][47][48] It is a freemium game, which means that the player can play without buying virtual currency, although they can use real money to speed up progress. It has 3D graphics and similar gameplay to the rest of the series, adding social media features to interact with other players.\\r\\nSimFarm was released in 1993 for DOS, Windows, and Mac and is a spinoff of SimCity. SimFarm focuses on developing a farm, allowing the player to plant crops and grow their farm.\\r\\nSim City: The Card Game is an out of print collectible card game based on the video game SimCity. It was released in 1995 by Mayfair Games. Several city expansions followed, adding location and politician cards from various cities including: Chicago, Washington, New York City, and Atlanta. A Toronto expansion was planned, but never released.[49]\\r\\nAs the name suggests, SimCopter puts the player in the role of a helicopter pilot.\\r\\nThere are two modes of play: free mode and career mode. The free mode lets the player import and fly through cities of their own or any of the 30 cities supplied with the game. However, user cities sometimes need to be designed with SimCopter in mind, and most of the time the player must increase the number of police stations, fire stations, and hospitals to allow for speedier dispatches. The second modethe heart of the gameis the career mode. This puts the player in the shoes of a pilot doing various jobs around the city.\\r\\nThe game gained controversy when a designer inserted sprites of shirtless \\"himbos\\" (male bimbos) in Speedo trunks who hugged and kissed each other, who appear in great numbers from time to time. Their fluorescent nipples were drawn with a special rendering mode usually reserved for fog-piercing runway landing lights, so they could easily be seen from long distances in bad weather. An unintended emergent behavior of the code caused hundreds of himbos to swarm and crowd around the helicopter, where they would be slashed up by the blades, and then need to be air-lifted to the hospitalwhich earned the player easy money. The easter egg was caught shortly after release and removed from future copies of the game.\\r\\nStreets of SimCity is a 1997 racing and vehicular combat computer game published by Maxis. One of the game's main attractions was the ability to explore any cities created in SimCity 2000 by car in a cinematic style. The game, like SimCopter, is in full 3D and the player's vehicle can be controlled using a keyboard, a joystick, or a gamepad. Another notable feature is the game's network mode, in which players can play deathmatches with up to seven other individuals. Notably, it is one of the few games in the Maxis series that Will Wright did not work on, and the last Maxis game to be developed and released without supervision by Electronic Arts[50] (which acquired Maxis in 1997 and assisted development of Maxis games thereafter).\\r\\nSimsVille was intended as a crossover spinoff of The Sims and SimCity, which would have allowed the player to build the city, as well as make sims and play them. The game was supposed to be released in late 2001; however in September 2001, Maxis announced they had cancelled it, along with SimMars, to focus on the future of The Sims expansions, as well as The Sims 2.","input":"What is the latest version of sim city?"},{"output":"seven","context":"Uno (/?u?no?/; from Italian and Spanish for 'one') (stylized as UNO) is an American shedding-type card game that is played with a specially printed deck. The game's general principles put it into the Crazy Eights family of card games. The game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. It has been a Mattel brand since 1992. When his family and friends began to play more and more, he spent $8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made. He sold it from his barbershop at first, and local businesses began to sell it as well. Robins later sold the rights to UNO to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak, a funeral parlor owner in Joliet, Illinois, for $50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game. Tezak formed International Games, Inc., to market UNO, with offices behind his funeral parlor. The games were produced by Lewis Saltzman of Saltzman Printers in Maywood, Illinois. In 1992, International Games became part of the Mattel family of companies.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points, achieved (usually over several rounds of play) by a player discarding all of their cards and earning points corresponding to the value of the remaining cards still held by the other players. Action cards (Skip, Draw Two and Reverse) are worth 20 Points while Wild and Wild Draw Four cards are worth 50 Points.\\r\\nThe deck consists of 108 cards, of which there are 25 of each color (red, green, blue, and yellow), each color having two of each rank except zero. The ranks in each color are zero to nine, \\"Skip\\", \\"Draw Two\\", and \\"Reverse\\" (the last three being \\"action cards\\"). In addition, the deck contains four each of \\"Wild\\" and \\"Wild Draw Four\\" cards.\\r\\nTo start a hand, seven cards are dealt to each player, with the top card of the deck flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile. The player to the dealer's left plays first, unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or Wild card (see below). On a player's turn, they must do one of the following:\\r\\nPlay proceeds clockwise around the table.\\r\\nAction and Wild cards have the following effects:\\r\\nA player who plays their next-to-last-card must call \\"Uno\\" as a warning to the other players.[4]\\r\\nThe first player to get rid of their last card (\\"going out\\") wins the hand and scores points for the cards held by the other players. Number cards count their face value, all action cards count 20, and Wild and Wild Draw Four cards count 50. If a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card is played to go out, the next player in sequence must draw the appropriate number of cards before the score is tallied.\\r\\nThe first player to score 500 points wins the game.\\r\\nIn a two-player game, the Reverse card acts like a Skip card; when played, the other player misses a turn.\\r\\nThe following house rules are suggested in the Uno rulebook, to alter the game:\\r\\nA strategy at Uno may be offensive (aiming to go out), or defensive (aiming to minimize the value of one's hand, in the event that another player goes out, thus getting those points). Part of the skill of playing Uno is knowing when to adopt an offensive or defensive strategy.\\r\\nAn offensive strategy would be holding on to Wild and Wild Draw Four cards, because they can be played near the end of the hand in order to go out (when it's harder to play a matching card). However, a defensive strategy would advise getting rid of such cards early, because they have a high point value.\\r\\nA defensive strategy would advise playing a high card in order to reduce the point value of the hand. However, an offensive strategy would suggest playing a 0 when the player wants to continue on the current color, because it is less likely to be matched by another 0 of a different color (there is only one 0 of each color, but two of each 1ÿ9).\\r\\nA player holding only one card is required to call out \\"Uno\\" or risk being penalized if caught. A player who calls \\"Uno\\" risks being the target of concerted action by the other players, who may be able to use action cards to prevent that player from going out. Depending on the level and seriousness of play, some players may deliberately avoid saying \\"Uno\\", in the hope of avoiding detection and then going out on the next turn. For this reason, it is useful to conceal how many cards are in your hand, and to keep track of how many cards every other player holds.\\r\\nLittle has been published on the optimal strategy for the game of Uno. Simulations of games may shed some light on the matter. Attempts to reduce point count in a player's hands can be \\"read\\" by other players if too transparent. This information can be exploited by other players, and it follows that a mixed strategy may be more appropriate.\\r\\nSome work has been done into the psychology of Uno as it relates to individual and group behavior.[5] Players may exhibit physical tells,[6] in which a subtle, often repeated, cue inadvertently reveals their state of mind during a game. Alternatively, they may change their playing style, switching from an aggressive card-shedding strategy to a more subdued one, or vice versa.\\r\\nThe new Uno action cards bear symbols which denote their action, except for the Wild cards which still bear the word \\"Wild.\\" Before the design change, such cards in English versions of the game had letters only. Especially old English versions can be denoted by the absence of the white rim that surrounds the edge of most Uno cards. Other versions use symbols and images in both old and new designs, especially ones with Wild cards that do not bear the word \\"Wild\\". The Xbox 360 version of the game uses the new English style of the cards. There are also language-free versions of the newer styles that do not bear the word \\"Wild\\" but have the same styling. There is a new version called \\"Uno Mod\\" where the cards have symbols instead of letters or numbers. This version also comes in a red and white case. It is one of several \\"Mod\\" games by Mattel, the others being Othello (game) Mod, Apples to Apples Mod, Phase 10 Mod, and Skip-Bo Mod.\\r\\nThere are many different themes and versions of Uno. These theme games may come with slightly different directions and special cards.\\r\\nNote: * indicates HIT Entertainment character, by which Mattel acquired HIT in 2012.\\r\\nCard sets only have 36 cards designed for children at least 3 years of age. These sets come in several variants, based on titles for children. My First Uno versions:\\r\\nUno versions available on the Xbox 360:\\r\\nSeveral sports teams each have 112-card sets, featuring players from those teams. The special cards in each deck vary depending on the card set itself.

Lying alongside the Mississippi River, La Crosse is the largest city on Wisconsin's western border.[6]\\r\\nThe city's estimated population in 2014 was 52,440.[7] The city forms the core of and is the principal city in the La Crosse-Onalaska, WI-MN Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of La Crosse County and Houston County, Minnesota, with a combined population of 135,298.[8] La Crosse is home to the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, Viterbo University, and Western Technical College. A regional technology and medical hub, La Crosse has received high rankings from some magazines in health, well-being, quality of life, and education.[6][9][10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Europeans to see the site of La Crosse were French fur traders who traveled the Mississippi River in the late 17th century. There is no written record of any visit to the site until 1805, when Lt. Zebulon Pike mounted an expedition up the Mississippi River for the United States. Pike recorded the location's name as \\"Prairie La Crosse.\\" The name originated from the game with sticks that resembled a bishop's crozier or la crosse in French, which was played by Native Americans there.[12][13]\\r\\nThe first white settlement at La Crosse occurred in 1841 when Nathan Myrick, a New York native, moved to the village at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin to work in the fur trade. Myrick was disappointed to find that because many fur traders were already well-entrenched there, there were no openings for him in the trade. As a result, he decided to establish a trading post upriver at the then still unsettled site of Prairie La Crosse. In 1841, he built a temporary trading post on Barron Island (now called Pettibone Park), which lies just west of La Crosse's present downtown. The following year, Myrick relocated the post to the mainland prairie, partnering with H. J. B. Miller to run the outfit.[14][15]\\r\\nThe spot Myrick chose to build his trading post proved ideal for settlement. It was near the junction of the Black, La Crosse, and Mississippi Rivers. In addition, the post was built at one of the few points along the Wisconsin side of the Mississippi River where a broad plain ideal for development existed between the river's bank and the tall bluffs that line the river valley. Because of these advantages, a small village grew around Myrick's trading post in the 1840s.\\r\\nA small Mormon community settled at La Crosse in 1844, building several dozen cabins a few miles south of Myrick's post. Although these settlers relocated away from the Midwest after just a year, the land they occupied near La Crosse continues to bear the name Mormon Coulee.[16]\\r\\nOn June 23, 1850, Father James Lloyd Breck of the Episcopal Church said the first Christian liturgy on top of Grandad Bluff.[17] Today a monument to that event stands atop the bluff, near the parking lot at a scenic overlook.\\r\\nMore permanent development took place closer to Myrick's trading post, where stores, a hotel, and a post office were constructed during the 1840s. Under the direction of Timothy Burns, lieutenant governor of Wisconsin, surveyor William Hood platted the village in 1851. This opened it up for further settlement, which was achieved rapidly as a result of promotion of the city in eastern newspapers. By 1855, La Crosse had grown in population to nearly 2,000 residents, leading to its incorporation in 1856. The city grew even more rapidly after 1858 with the completion of the La Crosse & Milwaukee Railroad, the second railroad connecting Milwaukee to the Mississippi River.\\r\\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, La Crosse grew to become one of the largest cities in Wisconsin.[citation needed] It was a center of the lumber industry, for logs cut in the interior of the state could be rafted down the Black River toward sawmills built in the city. La Crosse also became a center for the brewing industry and other manufacturers that saw advantages in the city's location adjacent to major transportation arteries, such as the Mississippi River and the railroad between Milwaukee and St. Paul, Minnesota. Around the turn of the 20th century, the city also became a center for education, with three colleges and universities established in the city between 1890 and 1912.\\r\\nLa Crosse remains the largest city on Wisconsin's western border, and the educational institutions in the city have recently led it toward becoming a regional technology and medical hub.\\r\\nLa Crosse is located on the western border of the midsection of Wisconsin, on a broad alluvial plain along the east side of the Mississippi River. The Black River empties into the Mississippi north of the city, and the La Crosse River flows into the Mississippi just north of the downtown area. Just upriver from its mouth, this river broadens into a marshland that splits the city into two distinct sections, north and south.\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 22.54 square miles (58.38?km2), of which, 20.52 square miles (53.15?km2) is land and 2.02 square miles (5.23?km2) is water.[1]\\r\\nSurrounding the relatively flat prairie valley where La Crosse lies are towering 500?ft bluffs, one of the most prominent of which is Grandad Bluff (mentioned in Life on the Mississippi by Mark Twain), which has an overlook of the three states region. This feature typifies the topography of the Driftless Area in which La Crosse sits. This rugged region is composed of high ridges dissected by narrow valleys called coulees, a French term. As a result, the area around La Crosse is frequently referred to as the \\"Coulee Region\\".\\r\\nLa Crosse's location in the United States' upper midwest gives the area a temperate, continental climate.[18] The warmest month of the year is July, when the average high temperature is 84.1?F (29?C), with overnight low temperatures averaging 63.2?F (18?C). January is the coldest month, with high temperatures averaging 25.9?F (-4?C), with the overnight low temperatures around 8.9?F (-14?C).[19]\\r\\n|source 3 = U.S. climate data [22]\\r\\nLa Crosse has 13 voting districts (wards).[23] Neighborhoods in the city include:\\r\\nSuburbs include French Island in the Town of Campbell, Holmen, the Town of Medary, City of Onalaska, and the Town of Shelby.\\r\\nAccording to 2009ÿ2013 ACS estimates, the median household income was $40,457 and the median family income was $57,744.

A preliminary version of the character also appears in the novel Go Set a Watchman, written in the mid 1950s but not published until 2015. Atticus is a lawyer and resident of the fictional Maycomb County, Alabama, and the father of Jeremy \\"Jem\\" Finch and Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch. Lee based the character on her own father, Amasa Coleman Lee, an Alabama lawyer, who, like Atticus, represented black defendants in a highly publicized criminal trial.[1] Book Magazine's list of The 100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900 names Finch as the seventh best fictional character of 20th-century literature.[2][3] In 2003 the American Film Institute voted Atticus Finch, as portrayed in an Academy Award-winning performance by Gregory Peck in the 1962 film adaptation, as the greatest hero of all American cinema.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nClaudia Durst Johnson has commented about critiques of the novel, saying, \\"A greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals\\".[5] Alice Petry remarked, \\"Atticus has become something of a folk hero in legal circles and is treated almost as if he were an actual person\\".[6] Examples of Atticus Finch's impact on the legal profession are plentiful. Richard Matsch, the federal judge who presided over the Timothy McVeigh trial, counts Atticus as a major judicial influence.[7] One law professor at the University of Notre Dame stated that the most influential textbook from which he taught was To Kill a Mockingbird, and an article in the Michigan Law Review asserts, \\"No real-life lawyer has done more for the self-image or public perception of the legal profession\\", before questioning whether \\"Atticus Finch is a paragon of honor or an especially slick hired gun.\\"[8]\\r\\nIn 1992 Monroe Freedman, a professor of law and noted legal ethicist, published two articles in the national legal newspaper Legal Times calling for the legal profession to set aside Atticus Finch as a role model.[9] Freedman argued that Atticus still worked within a system of institutionalized racism and sexism and should not be revered. Freedman's article sparked a flurry of responses from attorneys who entered the profession holding Atticus Finch as a hero and the reason for which they became lawyers.[10] Freedman argued that Atticus Finch is dishonest, unethical, sexist, and inherently racist, and that he did nothing to challenge the racist status quo in Maycomb.[11] Freedman's article sparked furious controversy, with one legal scholar opining, \\"What Monroe really wants is for Atticus to be working on the front lines for the NAACP in the 1930s, and, if he's not, he's disqualified from being any kind of hero; Monroe has this vision of lawyer as prophet. Atticus has a vision of lawyer not only as prophet but as parish priest\\".[9] In 1997 the Alabama State Bar erected a monument dedicated to Atticus in Monroeville marking his existence as the \\"first commemorative milestone in the state's judicial history\\".[12]\\r\\nAtticus Finch's willingness to support social outcasts and victims of prejudice is the eponymous inspiration for the name of the Atticus Circle, which is an organization composed of \\"straight allies\\" (that is, heterosexual people supportive of the LGBT-rights movement).[13] Former president Barack Obama referenced Atticus Finch as an ideal American character. In addition Atticus was mentioned during one of Obama's speeches.\\r\\nIn July 2015, days before Lee's highly anticipated second novel Go Set a Watchman, was officially published, the first chapter was released on The Guardian for public viewing. On that day, a New York Times review of the book (which is set about twenty years after the time period depicted in Mockingbird but is not a chronological sequel)[14] revealed that Atticus, depicted in this version as being in his early seventies, is portrayed as a far less-progressive character. He makes comments that favor segregation and has attended a Citizens Council meeting. This has proved controversial to many readers, unaware perhaps that although To Kill a Mockingbird was published first, Watchman is the first draft of the text that later became Mockingbird and the characterizations and key plot details between the two books are not only different but sometimes contradictory.[15]\\r\\nIn terms of plot, Tom Robinson is acquitted in Watchman while in Mockingbird his unjust conviction as the result of prejudice was a central part of not only the story but why Atticus is seen culturally as such a righteous and progressive character. His defense is based on not just Robinson's innocence but on his fundamental equality. His closing argument is a more polished version of the progressive argument the adult Jean Louise makes in Watchman and there are other instances where both versions contain the same descriptions word for word.[16] This kind of character development, where motivations and ideals between characters, for reasons of plot, are changed is not unusual in the process of creative writing. Apart from the more progressive depiction of Atticus, the depiction of the town itself, especially the African-American characters, is also dramatically altered between the two drafts.[17] Real-life comparisons with Lee's father, Amasa Coleman Lee, have also been made in the two differing versions of Atticus in that originally Lee was in favor of segregation but became more liberal later in life, later changing his views to those of Integration. [18] Tay Hohoff, Lee's editor, has also been argued to have played a major part in the character development of the novel and particularly Atticus' liberal transformation. Jonathan Mahler of The New York Times notes in his article The Invisible Hand Behind Harper Lees To Kill a Mockingbird[19] that Ms. Hohoff, at the same time as she was guiding Ms. Lee through the Mockingbird re-write, was working on her own biography of the early-20th-century New York activist and humanist John Lovejoy Elliot. He notes that the book, A Ministry to Man, was published in 1959, a year before Mockingbird.

In a four-day period, many areas received more than 40 inches (100?cm) of rain as the system slowly meandered over eastern Texas and adjacent waters, causing catastrophic flooding. With peak accumulations of 64.58?in (164.0?cm), Harvey is the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the United States. The resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of homes, displaced more than 30,000?people, and prompted more than 17,000?rescues.\\r\\nThe eighth named storm, third hurricane, and the first major hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Harvey developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles, reaching tropical storm status on August?17. The storm crossed through the Windward Islands on the following day, passing just south of Barbados and later near Saint Vincent. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea, Harvey began to weaken due to moderate wind shear and degenerated into a tropical wave north of Colombia early on August?19. The remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west-northwestward across the Caribbean and the Yucatn Peninsula, before redeveloping over the Bay of Campeche on August?23. Harvey then began to rapidly intensify on August?24, regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day. While the storm moved generally northwest, Harvey's intensification phase stalled slightly overnight from August?24ÿ25; however, Harvey soon resumed strengthening and quickly became a major hurricane and attained Category?4 intensity later that day. Hours later, Harvey made landfall near Rockport, Texas, at peak intensity. Afterwards, rapid weakening ensued, and Harvey had downgraded to a tropical storm as it stalled near the coastline of the state, dropping torrential and unprecedented amounts of rainfall over the Lone Star state. On August 28, it emerged back over the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening slightly before making a third and final landfall in Louisiana on August 29. As Harvey drifted inland, it quickly weakened again as it became extratropical on September 1, before dissipating two days later.\\r\\nHarvey caused at least 77 confirmed deaths: 1 in Guyana,[1] and 76 in the United States.[2][3][4] Economic losses are preliminarily estimated at between $70[5] to $200 billion,[6] with a large portion of the losses sustained by uninsured homeowners.\\r\\nAt the beginning of August?13, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave on the western coast of Africa. Amid favorable environmental conditions, the wave was expected to merge with a broad area of low pressure southwest of Cape Verde and gradually organize thereafter.[7] Instead, the two disturbances remained separate, with the broad trough continuing westward and the tropical wave moving farther north.[8] On August?17, shower and thunderstorm activity in association with the trough began to show signs of organization,[9] while high-resolution satellite showed an increasingly defined low-level circulation.[10] As such, the NHC initiated advisories on a potential tropical cyclone, allowing tropical storm watches and warnings to be hoisted for portions of the Lesser Antilles.[11] An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft deployed to the disturbance later that afternoon found a well-defined center and tropical storm-force winds, prompting the NHC to upgrade it to Tropical Storm Harvey at 21:00?UTC.[12]\\r\\nFollowing its designation, the cyclone moved swiftly westward into the Caribbean Sea under the influence of an expansive ridge of high pressure to its north. An environment of moderate wind shear complicated the weather of the storm's intensity, with global forecast models suggesting dissipation in the central Caribbean, whereas statistical and hurricane models suggested the potential for Harvey to be near hurricane strength in later days.[12] Over the next day, the storm changed little in structure, remaining poorly organized with its low-level center on the eastern edge of associated deep convection.[13] Harvey's presentation began to deteriorate early on August?19; its convective pattern became elongated while the circulation became less defined. In fact, a reconnaissance aircraft was unable to find a loosely-closed circulation at 850?mb (4,781?ft), though it did locate one at lower levels.[14] Harvey was downgraded to a tropical depression at 21:00?UTC on August?19;[15] six hours later, based on continued data from a reconnaissance aircraft, it was declared an open tropical wave.[16]\\r\\nEarly on August?20, the NHC began monitoring the remnants of Harvey for redevelopment. Although the effects of strong upper-level winds and dry air were expected to limit development in the near-term, conditions were expected to become more conducive to tropical storm and hurricane conditions when the disturbance entered the northwestern Caribbean Sea, and especially in the Bay of Campeche.[17] Despite an increase in convective organization, the disturbance still lacked a well-defined center as it approached the Yucatn Peninsula.[18] While traversing inland, satellite images and surface observations indicated that the circulation became better defined.[19]\\r\\nA reconnaissance aircraft investigating the remnants of Harvey around 15:00?UTC on August?23 indicated that it once again acquired a well-defined center, and the NHC upgraded it to a tropical depression accordingly.[20] The system began to slowly consolidate amid an increasingly favorable environment,[21] attaining tropical storm intensity by 06:00?UTC on August?24.[22] Later that morning, Harvey began to undergo rapid intensification as an eye developed and its central pressure quickly fell.[23] By 17:00?UTC, the storm was upgraded to the third hurricane of the season.[24] Slight entrainment of dry air slowed the intensification process, however, by the next day, Harvey was able to quickly strengthen into a Category?3 major hurricane by 19:00?UTC.[25] Further deepening occurred as the storm approached the coast of Texas, with Harvey becoming a Category?4 hurricane at 23:00?UTC, based on reconnaissance aircraft data.[26] Around 03:00?UTC on August?26, the hurricane made landfall at peak intensity at Rockport with winds of 130?mph (215?km/h) and an atmospheric pressure of 938?mbar (27.7?inHg).[27] Harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005 and the strongest in terms of wind speed to hit the country since Charley in 2004. It was the first hurricane to strike Texas since Hurricane Ike in 2008,[28] the first major hurricane in the state since Bret in 1999, and the strongest in Texas since Carla in 1961.[29]\\r\\nAfter striking land, the storm moved over the Copano Bay and made a second landfall in Texas just north of Holiday Beach at 06:00?UTC on August?26 as a Category?3 hurricane.[30] Afterwards, rapid weakening ensued as its speed slowed dramatically to a crawl, and Harvey weakened to a tropical storm at 18:00?UTC on August?26.[31] For about two days the storm stalled just inland, dropping very heavy rainfall and causing widespread flash flooding. Harvey's center drifted back towards the southeast, positioning itself near or just off the Texas coast at Matagorda by 15:00 UTC on August 28.[32] Once offshore, convection blossomed and allowed the once-exposed low-level circulation to become obscured. An Air Force reconnaissance plane investigating the system during the afternoon of August?29 found that maximum winds had increased to 50?mph (85?km/h).[33] Around 09:00?UTC the next morning, Harvey made its third and final landfall just west of Cameron, Louisiana, with winds of 45?mph (75?km/h).[34]\\r\\nThe system continued north and then north-northeast, weakening to a tropical depression over central Louisiana around 00:00?UTC on August?30.[35] Associated convection with Harvey became focused north of the center and along a warm front on September?1, indicating that the system transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone by 15:00?UTC that day.[36] However, Harvey's remnants continued moving northeastward, while slowly weakening. Late on September 2, the WPC issued its final advisory on Harvey's remnant low, while it was located over Ohio.[37] Harvey's remnants continued to drift northward, before being absorbed by another low pressure system north of Lake Erie, late on September 3.[38]\\r\\nTropical cyclone warnings and watches for the Windward Islands were issued starting at 15:00?UTC on August?17, about six hours before Harvey developed. At that time, a tropical storm watch was posted for Dominica, while a tropical storm warning became in effect in Barbados, Martinique, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.[11] All watches and warnings were discontinued by late on August?18, as the storm continued westward into the Caribbean.[39]\\r\\nIn Honduras, a green alert was issued for the Atlntida, Islas de la Baha, Col܇n, Corts, Gracias a Dios, Olancho, and Yoro departments. About 8 inches (20?cm) of precipitation was expected along the coast, while inland areas were forecast to receive 2.76 to 3.15?in (7.0 to 8.0?cm) of rain.[40] As the remnants of Harvey approached Mexico, the Civil Protection Secretary of the state of Campeche issued a blue alert, indicting minimal danger.[41] When Harvey redeveloped at 15:00?UTC on August?23, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch in Tamaulipas from Boca De Catan to the mouth of the Rio Grande.[42] The watch remained in effect until 21:00?UTC on August?25, after it became evident that the storm no longer posed a significant threat to that area.[43]\\r\\nFEMA worked with the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to prepare for the storm and its aftermath. The agency placed disaster response teams on standby at emergency posts in Austin, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.[44]\\r\\nComments from the White House (begin at 25:50)\\r\\nComments from National Weather Service director Louis Uccellini\\r\\nShelter in place briefing by FEMA\\r\\nComments by the Governor of Texas\\r\\nUpon the NHC resuming advisories for Harvey at 15:00?UTC on August?23, a hurricane watch was issued in Texas from Port Mansfield to San Luis Pass, while a tropical storm watch was posted from Port Mansfield south to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from San Luis Pass to High Island. Additionally, a storm surge watch became in effect from Port Mansfield to High Island.[42] Additional watches and warnings were posted in these areas at 09:00?UTC on August?24, with a hurricane warning from Port Mansfield to Matagorda; a tropical storm warning from Matagorda to High Island; a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning from Port Mansfield to the Rio Grande; a storm surge warning from Port Mansfield to San Luis Pass; and a storm surge from Port Mansfield to the Rio Grande.[45] The watches and warnings were adjusted accordingly after Harvey moved inland and began weakening, with the warning discontinued at 15:00?UTC on August?26.[46] By 09:00?UTC on the following day, only a tropical storm warning and a storm surge warning remained in effect from Port O'Connor to Sargent. However, watches and warnings were re-issued as Harvey began to re-emerge into the Gulf of Mexico, and beginning at 15:00?UTC on August?28, a tropical storm warning was in effect for the entire Gulf Coast of Texas from High Island northward.[47]\\r\\nGovernor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for 30?counties on August?23, while mandatory evacuations were issued for Brazoria, Calhoun, Jackson, Refugio, San Patricio, and Victoria counties, as well as parts of Matagorda County.[48] On August?26, Governor Abbott added an additional 20?counties to the state of emergency declaration.[49] Furthermore, the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters was activated by the USGS on behalf of the Governor's Texas Emergency Management Council, including the Texas Division of Emergency Management, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage.[50]\\r\\nIn Louisiana, Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency for the entire state. A mandatory evacuation was ordered in Cameron Parish for the cities of Big Lake, Cameron, Creole, Grand Chenier, Hackberry, Holly Beach, and Johnson Bayou. Additionally, a voluntary evacuation was ordered in Vermilion Parish for low-lying areas south of State Highway 14. The Louisiana National Guard prepared about 500,000?sandbags and emergency boats and high-water-rescue vehicles were placed on standby should flooding occur. In New Orleans, there were concerns about whether or not the city's drainage system could handle a heavy rainfall event, with only 105?of the 120?water pumps being operational and some power turbines being out of service.[51] The city's public schools, as well as six universities and a medical school, closed on August 29.[52] As Harvey began re-emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on August?28, the tropical storm warning in Texas from Mesquite Bay to High Island was extended eastward into Louisiana to the community of Cameron at 12:00?UTC, while a tropical storm watch was issued from Cameron to Intracoastal City.[47]\\r\\nWinds left residents throughout Barbados without electricity, with a majority of outages occurring in Christ Church, Saint Joseph, Saint Lucy, and Saint Michael provinces. Flooding washed one house off its foundation, while water entered some houses, forcing some people to evacuate. Bridges in Saint Andrew and Saint Joseph were damaged. Additionally, a fuel depot in Speightstown was flooded. Winds deroofed a church.[53] In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, nine homes were flooded and four others experienced wind damage. Also, a tree fell on a school, damaging the building. Blocked drains in Port Elizabeth resulted in more than 15?businesses being flooded. A total of 15?people were housed in shelters after the storm.[1]\\r\\nStrong winds and heavy rainfall also affected Suriname and Guyana. In the former, high winds in the capital city of Paramaribo caused roof damage to the Presidential Palace and two homes, while the Torarica Hotel and Casino suffered structural impact. Additionally, four dwellings were deroofed in Commewijne and three others lost their roofs in Wanica; in the latter, the Ministry of Social Affairs building was damaged by falling trees. In Guyana, the village of Jawalla bore the brunt of the storm. Four homes were demolished, while five other residences and two shops were damaged. Several public buildings were also damaged, including the community center, the village council buildings, the nursery, and public schools. A 29-year-old woman died after her house collapsed on her.[1]\\r\\nThroughout Texas, more than 300,000?people were left without electricity and billions of dollars of property damage was sustained.[49] As of September 26, at least 73 fatalities have been confirmed, most of which were drownings.[2] By August?29, 2017 approximately 13,000?people had been rescued across the state while an estimated 30,000 were displaced.[54] The refinery industry capacity was reduced, and oil and gas production was affected in the Gulf of Mexico and inland Texas.[55] On Monday, various news outlets announced the closure of oil refineries ahead of Hurricane Harvey, creating an artificial fuel shortage. Panicked, motorists waited in long lines. Consequently, gas stations through the state were forced to close due to the rush.[56] More than 20 percent of refining capacity was affected[57].\\r\\nMore than 48,700 homes were affected by Harvey throughout the state, including over 1,000 that were completely destroyed and more than 17,000 that sustained major damage; approximately 32,000 sustained minor damage. Nearly 700 businesses were damaged as well.[58] Texas Department of Public Safety stated more than 185,000 homes were damaged and 9,000 destroyed.[59]\\r\\nMaking landfall as a Category?4, Harvey inflicted tremendous damage across Aransas County.[60] Wind gusts were observed up to 132?mph (212?km/h) near Port Aransas.[61] In Rockport, entire blocks were leveled by the hurricane's winds. The city's courthouse was severely damaged when a cargo trailer was hurled into it, coming to a stop halfway through the structure. The gymnasium of the Rockport-Fulton High School lost multiple walls while the school itself suffered some damage.[60] A Fairfield Inn in the city was severely damaged.[62] One person died in a house fire in the city, unable to be rescued due to the extreme weather conditions.[63] As of August?28, an estimated 30ÿ40?people remain unaccounted for across Aransas County, including 9 in Rockport. Nearly every structure in Port Aransas suffered damage.[60] By the afternoon of August?26, more than 20?in (51?cm) of rain had fallen in the Corpus Christi metropolitan area.[49] All of Victoria was left without water and most had no power.[60]\\r\\nMany locations in the Houston metropolitan area observed at least 30?in (76?cm) of precipitation,[64] with a maximum of 64.58?in (164.0?cm) in Nederland.[65] This makes Harvey the wettest tropical cyclone on record for both Texas and the United States,[66] surpassing the previous rainfall record held by Tropical Storm Amelia.[67] The local National Weather Service office in Houston observed all-time record daily rainfall accumulations on both August?26 and 27, measured at 14.4?in (37?cm) and 16.08?in (40.8?cm) respectively.[68] Multiple flash flood emergencies were issued in the Houston area by the National Weather Service beginning the night of August 26. In Pearland, a suburb south of Houston, a report was made of 9.92\\" of rainfall in 90 minutes.[69] The 39.11?in (99.3?cm) of rain in August made the month the wettest ever recorded in Houston since record keeping began in 1892, more than doubling the previous record of 19.21?in (48.8?cm) in June 2001.[70] The storm surge peaked at 6 feet at Port Lavaca,[71][72] reducing outflow of rainwater from land to sea.[73]\\r\\nDuring the storm, more than 800 Houston area flights were canceled, including 704?at George Bush Intercontinental Airport and 123?at William P. Hobby Airport. Both airports eventually closed.[74] Several tornadoes were spawned in the area, one of which damaged or destroyed the roofs of dozens of homes in Sienna Plantation.[49] As of August?29, 14?fatalities have been confirmed from flooding in the Houston area, including 6 from the same family who died when their van was swept off a flooded bridge.[75] A police officer drowned while trying to escape rising waters.[76]\\r\\nAn estimated 25ÿ30?percent of Harris Countyroughly 444?mi2 (1,150?km2) of landwas submerged.[54]\\r\\nLate on August?27, a mandatory evacuation was issued for all of Bay City as model projections indicated the downtown area would be inundated by 10?ft (3.0?m) of water. Flooding was anticipated to cut off access to the city around 1:00?p.m. CDT on August?28.[77] Evacuations took place in Conroe on August?28 following release of water from the Lake Conroe dam.[78] On the morning on August?29, a levee along Columbia Lakes in Brazoria County was breached, prompting officials to urgently request for everyone in the area to evacuate.[79][80]\\r\\nOn August 28, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began controlled water releases from Addicks and Barker Reservoirs in the Buffalo Bayou watershed in an attempt to manage flood levels in the immediate area. According to the local Corps commander, \\"Its going to be better to release the water through the gates directly into Buffalo Bayou as opposed to letting it go around the end and through additional neighborhoods and ultimately into the bayou.\\" At the time the releases started, the reservoirs had been rising at more than 6 inches (15?cm) per hour.[81] Many people began evacuating the area, fearing a levee breach.[82] Despite attempts to alleviate the water rise, the Addicks Reservoir reached capacity on the morning of August?29 and began spilling out.[83] The NASA Johnson Space Center has been closed to employees and visitors due to the flooding until September 5. Only the critical mission control staff remain and reside in the control rooms to monitor procedures of the International Space Station.[84]\\r\\nThe BeaumontÿPort Arthur metropolitan area also experienced torrential precipitation, including 32.55?in (82.7?cm) of rainfall in Beaumont.[64] Rising waters of the Neches River caused the city to lose service from its main pump station, as well as its secondary water source in Hardin County, cutting water supply to the city for an unknown amount of time.[86] Flooding to the north and east of the Houston area resulted in mandatory evacuations for portions of Liberty, Jefferson, and Tyler counties, while Jasper and Newton counties were under a voluntary evacuation.[87] One death occurred in Beaumont when a woman exited her disabled vehicle, but was swept away.[88] In Port Arthur, the mayor stated that the entire city was submerged by water. Hundreds of displaced residents went to the Robert A. \\"Bob\\" Bowers Civic Center for shelter, but they were evacuated again after the building began to flood. Water entered at least several hundreds of homes in Jefferson County.[89]\\r\\nHeavy rainfall extended eastward into Louisiana, with the state recording up to 14.88?in (37.8?cm) of precipitation near the town of Iowa.[64] In the town of Lake Charles, water reached 4?ft (1.2?m) in height, with homes flooded and hundreds of people forced to evacuate in one neighborhood alone. Throughout the state, about 500?people were rescued by August?28, while 269?people went to a shelter in southwest Louisiana, about 200?of whom were rescued from their homes.[90] An EF2 tornado near Evangeline damaged four homes, one of which was destroyed. The tornado also damaged fences, a motorcycle, a pickup truck, and toppled three electrical poles.[91]\\r\\nIn Alabama, a tornado in the vicinity of Reform damaged two homes and destroyed a barn along State Route 17, while four people were hospitalized for their injuries. A possible tornado in Lamar County near Kennedy caused damage to trees and roofs.[92] In Tennessee, more than 19,000?people lost electricity in Memphis.[93] Low-lying streets in the area were inundated with water. One indirect death occurred in Memphis due to a weather-related head-on collision of a car and a tractor trailer on Interstate 40.[3] Heavy rainfall in Nashville inundated a number of roads and flooded an apartment complex, resulting in the evacuation of 13?people. Overall, about 50?people in the city evacuated from flooded areas.[94]\\r\\nEnergy production in the Gulf of Mexico declined in the wake of Harvey by approximately 21%  378,633 barrels per day of the 1.75 million barrels of oil produced each day. Natural gas production declined by about 25.71%  827.89 million metric standard cubic meters per day (MMSCFD). The Eagle Ford Rock Formation (shale oil and gas) in southern Texas reduced production by 300,000 to 500,000 bpd, according to the Texas Railroad Commission. Many energy-related ports and terminals are closed, delaying about fourteen crude oil tankers. About 2.25 million bpd of refining capacity was offline for several days; that is about 12% of total US capacity, with refineries affected at Corpus Christi, and later Port Arthur and Beaumont, and Lake Charles, Louisiana. The price of Brent crude versus West Texas Intermediate crude oil achieved a split of U.S.?$5.[95]\\r\\nTwo ExxonMobil refineries had to be shut down following related storm damage and releases of hazardous pollutants.[96] Two oil storage tanks owned by Burlington Resources Oil and Gas collectively spilled 30,000?gallons of crude in DeWitt County. An additional 8,500?gallons of wastewater was spilled in the incidents.[97]\\r\\nOn August 30, the CEO of Arkema warned one of its chemical plants in Crosby, Texas, could explode or be subject to intense fire due to the loss of \\"critical refrigeration\\" of materials.[98] All workers at the facility and residents within 1.5?mi (2.4?km) were evacuated. Eight of the plant's nine refrigeration units failed without power, enabling the stored chemicals to decompose and become combustible. Two explosions occurred around 2:00?a.m. on August?31; 21?emergency personnel were briefly hospitalized.[99]\\r\\nDue to the shutdown in refineries, gas prices did see an increase nationwide.[100] However, the increase was not as extensive as Hurricane Katrina due to the development of more fuel-efficient vehicles as well as fracking technology having been refined since Katrina to allow oil drilling in shale areas such as the Marcellus Formation.[101] Additionally, Harvey's impact coincided with Labor Day Weekend, which sees a traditional increase in gas prices due to the heavy travel for that weekend.[102] Nonetheless, the spike brought the highest gas prices in two years.[101]\\r\\nThe flooding in Houston from the storm required the traditional Governor's Cup National Football League preseason game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans scheduled for August 31 to be moved from NRG Stadium in Houston to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.[103] The game was later cancelled to allow the Houston Texans players to return to Houston after the storm.[104] In addition, the Houston Astros were forced to move their August 29ÿ31 series with the Texas Rangers from Minute Maid Park in Houston to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida;[105] ironically, just two weeks later, Hurricane Irma would force the stadium's regular tenants, the Tampa Bay Rays, to move three home games to Citi Field in New York City.[106] The annual Texas Kickoff game that was to feature BYU and LSU to kick off the 2017 college football season was moved to the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.[107] The NCAA FBS football game between Houston and UTSA was postponed due to the aftermath of the storm. It was originally scheduled for September 2 at the Alamodome in San Antonio and is expected to be rescheduled.[108]\\r\\nThe Houston Dynamo rescheduled a planned Major League Soccer match against Sporting Kansas City on August 26 to October 11. The Houston Dash of the National Women's Soccer League rescheduled their August 27 match against the North Carolina Courage to a date that has not been announced.[109] Both teams moved their training camps to Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas (near Dallas) while preparing for their next matches; the Dash's match the following week, against the Seattle Reign, will be played in Frisco, with all proceeds from ticket sales benefiting an American Red Cross relief fund for hurricane victims.[110] The Dynamo and Major League Soccer also donated a combined $1 million into the hurricane relief fund, while also opening BBVA Compass Stadium to accept donated supplies for processing and distribution.[111][112]\\r\\nAthletic events were rescheduled as far away as Kentucky, where the storm's remnants were expected to cause heavy rains on September 1, interfering with Friday night high school football. More than 50 high schools in the state moved games that had been scheduled for Friday to either Thursday or Saturday.[113]\\r\\nHouston Mayor Sylvester Turner imposed a mandatory curfew on August?29 from 12?a.m. to 5?a.m. local time until further notice. He cited looting as the primary reason for the curfew.[114] On August?29, President Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and U.S. Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz toured damage in the Corpus Christi metropolitan area.[115] President Trump made a formal request for $5.95?billion in federal funding on August?31 for affected areas, the vast majority of which would go to FEMA.[116]\\r\\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott deployed the state's entire National Guard for search and rescue, recovery, and clean up operations due to the devastating damage caused by the storm and resulting floods.[117][118] Other states' National Guard's have offered assistance, with several having already been sent.[119][120] Meanwhile, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement assigned approximately 150 employees from around the country to assist with disaster relief efforts, while stating that no immigration enforcement operations would be conducted.[58]\\r\\nApproximately 32,000?people were displaced in shelters across the state by August?31. The George R. Brown Convention Center, the state's largest shelter, reached capacity with 8,000?evacuees. The NRG Center opened as a large public shelter accordingly. More than 210,000?people registered with FEMA for disaster assistance.[121]\\r\\nThe Cajun Navy, an informal organization of volunteers with boats from Louisiana, deployed to Texas to assist in high-water rescues.[122]\\r\\nThe Houston Independent School District announced that all students on any of the district's campuses would be eligible for free lunch throughout the 2017ÿ18 school year. The Federal Department of Education eased financial aid rules and procedures for those affected by Harvey, giving schools the ability to waive paperwork requirements; loan borrowers were given more flexibility in managing their loan payments.[58] A 36-year-old inmate sentenced to death for a 2003 murder was granted a temporary reprieve as a result of Harvey, as his legal team was based in Harris County, an area heavily affected by the hurricane.[58]\\r\\nBy August?30, corporations across the nation collectively donated more than $72?million to relief efforts, with 42?companies donating at least $1?million.[123] Professional athletic teams, their players, and managers provided large donations to assist victims of the storm. The Houston Astros pledged $4?million to relief along with all proceeds from their home game raffles. Houston Rockets owner Leslie Alexander also donated $4?million to the cause.[124] A fundraiser established by Houston Texans defensive lineman J. J. Watt exceeded $37?million.[125] The Texas Rangers and Tennessee Titans both provided $1?million, while the New England Patriots pledged to match up to $1?million in donations to the Red Cross.[126] Multiple Hollywood celebrities also pitched in, collectively donating more than $10?million, with Sandra Bullock providing the largest single donation of $1?million.[127] Leonardo DiCaprio provided $1?million to the United Way Harvey Recovery Fund through his foundation.[128] President Donald Trump reportedly donated $1?million to 12 charities involved in relief efforts.[129] Rachael Ray provided donations totaling $1?million to animal shelters across the Houston area.[130]\\r\\nBased on current damage estimates made by multiple agencies, Hurricane Harvey is likely to be at least the second-most costly natural disaster in U.S. history, behind only Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[5][131] Moody's Analytics has estimated the total economic cost of the storm at $81 billion to $108 billion or more; most of the economic losses are damage to homes and commercial property.[5] USA Today reported an AccuWeather estimate of $190 billion, released August 31.[132] On September 3, Texas state governor Greg Abbott estimated that damages will be between $150?billion and $180?billion, surpassing the $120?billion that it took to rebuild New Orleans after Katrina.[133][134] According to weather analytics firm Planalytics, lost revenue to Houston area retailers and restaurants alone will be approximately $1 billion. The Houston area controls 4% of the spending power in the United States.[135]\\r\\nIn September 2017, the Insurance Council of Texas estimated the total insured losses from Hurricane Harvey at $19 billion. This figure represents $11 billion in flood losses insured by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), $3 billion in \\"insured windstorm and other storm-related property losses\\"; and about $4.75 billion in insured flood losses of private and commercial vehicles.[136]\\r\\nA significant portion of the storm's damages may be uninsured losses. Regular homeowner insurance policies generally exclude coverage for flooding, as the NFIP underwrites most flood insurance policies in the US.[137][138] Although the purchase of flood insurance is obligatory for federally guaranteed mortgages for homes within the 100-year flood plain, enforcement of the requirement is difficult and many homes, even within the 100-year flood plain, lack flood insurance.[137] In Harris County, Texaswhich includes the city of Houstononly 15% of homes have flood insurance policies issued by the NFIP. Participation in the NFIP is higher, but still low, in neighboring Galveston (41%), Brazoria (26%), and Chambers Counties (21%).[137] Homeowners sued authorities after reservoir releases damaged homes.[139]\\r\\nOn September 8, President Donald Trump signed into law H.R. 601, which among other spending actions designated $15 billion for Hurricane Harvey relief.[140]\\r\\nThe American Red Cross, Salvation Army, United States Equestrian Federation, Humane Society of the United States, Knights of Columbus, Catholic Charities USA, AmeriCares, Operation BBQ relief, many celebrities, and many other charitable organizations provided help to the victims of the storm. [141][142][143] Anarchists (including Antifa) also provided relief.[144] Business aviation played a part in the rescue efforts, providing support during the storm as well as relief flights bringing in suppliers in the immediate aftermath.[145]\\r\\nVolunteers from amateur radio's emergency service wing, the Amateur Radio Emergency Service, provided communications in American Red Cross shelters in South Texas. [146]\\r\\nMany corporations also contributed to relief efforts. Operation BBQ relief had the help from several local individuals and businesses kick off the support of providing meals for volunteers and victims. Smokers, pallets of wood, and another company came up with the pounds of pork to kick off the support effort.[147] Although Operation BBQ relief has been in effect since May 2011 with the 2011 Joplin tornado, they estimate the Houston 2017 relief project to be their biggest ever.\\r\\nOperation BBQ relief vendors volunteering for the Houston flood relief estimates that they will serve at least 450,000 meals.[148] On August 27, 2017 it was estimated that Operation BBQ relief will be expecting 25,000 to 30,000 meals a day.[149]\\r\\nOn August 27, 2017 KSL-TV, KSL Newsradio, FM100.3, and 103.5 The Arrow created a fundraiser to help Texas residents impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Because of an anonymous donor willing to match $2 for every $1 raised up to a total of $100,000, Peter Huntsman also agreed to match donations up to $100,000. The combined total of $200,000 was met by August 31, 2017. Their new goal is $1 million.[150]\\r\\nSingapore dispatched Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the Republic of Singapore Air Force to areas affected by the hurricane for humanitarian operations, working alongside the Texas National Guard.[151] Israel pledged $1 million in relief funds for restoration of non-state run communal infrastructure.[152] Mexico sent volunteers from the Mexican Red Cross, firemen from Coahuila, and rescue teams from Guanajuato to Houston to assist in relief.[153] Mexico later rescinded their commitment for aid after Hurricane Katia made landfall on Mexico's Gulf Coast, on September 9, 2017.[154] Venezuela offered $5 million through the state-owned Citgo Petroleum, which operates a refinery in Corpus Christi.[155]\\r\\nThe floodwaters contain a number of hazards to the environment and human health. The Houston Health Department stated that \\"millions of contaminants\\" were present in floodwaters.[156] These include E. coli and coliform bacteria; measurements of colony-forming units showed the concentrations were so high that there were risks of contracting flesh-eating disease from the water.[157]\\r\\nHouston officials stated that the Houston drinking water and sewer systems were intact; however, \\"hundreds of thousands of people across the 38 Texas counties affected by Hurricane Harvey use private wells, according to an estimate by Louisiana State University researchers, and those people must fend for themselves.\\"[156] Additionally, Harris County, which includes Houston, contains a large number of Superfund-designed brownfield sites that contain a wide variety of toxins and carcinogens.[156] Two Superfund sites in Corpus Christi were flooded.[156]\\r\\nThe Geography of Houston places it in a low-lying part of the Gulf Coastal Plain, and its clay-based soils provide poor drainage. The climate of Houston brings very heavy rainfall, which together with tidal flood events means that there have been repeated floods in the city ever since its founding in 1836, though the flood control district founded in 1947, aided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, managed to prevent statewide flooding for over fifty years. More recently, residents died in \\"historic flooding\\" in May 2015, and in the April 2016 \\"tax day floods\\".[158][159] There is a tendency for storms to move very slowly over the region, and drop huge amounts of rain over an extended period, as occurred during Tropical Storm Claudette in 1979, and Tropical Storm Allison in 2001.[160]\\r\\nThe area is a very flat flood plain at shallow gradient, slowly draining rainwater through an intricate network of channels and bayous to the sea. The main waterways, the San Jacinto River and the Buffalo Bayou, meander slowly, laden with mud, and have little capacity for carrying storm water.[161]\\r\\nHouston has seen rapid urban development (urban sprawl), with absorbent prairie and wetlands replaced by hard surfaces which rapidly shed storm water, overwhelming the drainage capacity of the rivers and channels.[162] Between 1992 and 2010, almost 25,000 acres of wetlands were lost, decreasing the detention capacity of the region by four billion gallons.[163] However, Harvey was estimated to have dropped more than fifteen trillion gallons of water in the area.[164]\\r\\nThe Katy Prairie in western Harris County, which once helped to absorb floodwaters in the region, has been reduced to one quarter of its previous size in the last several decades due to suburban development, and one analysis discovered that more than 7,000 housing units have been built within the 100-year floodplain in Harris County since 2010.[165]\\r\\nExtraction of oil and groundwater from underground aquifers leaves unsupported voids resulting in ground collapse, a process called subsidence. Houston itself is in a very large subsidence bowl, with smaller bowls within that area showing greater subsidence: in some cases as much as 9 feet (2.7?m). These result in drainage systems no longer having the required gradient to operate efficiently, so storm water drains more slowly.[166] The coastline near Houston has seen sea level increasing by 6 inches (15?cm) in recent decades due to subsidence combined with the effects of climate change.[167][166]\\r\\nThe Gulf of Mexico is known for hurricanes in August, so their incidence alone cannot be attributed to global warming, but the warming climate does influence certain attributes of storms. Studies in this regard show that storms tend to intensify more rapidly prior to landfall.[168] Weather events are due to multiple factors, and so cannot be said to be caused by one precondition, but climate change affects aspects of extreme events, and very likely worsened some of the impacts of Harvey.[169] In a briefing, the World Meteorological Organization stated that the quantity of rainfall from Harvey had very likely been increased by climate change. The relationship between climate change and the frequency of hurricanes (or tropical cyclones) is still unclear, and is the subject of continuing research.[170]\\r\\nHarvey approached Houston over sea-surface waters which were significantly above average temperatures. Warm waters provide the main source of energy for hurricanes, and increased ocean heat can result in storms being larger, more intense and longer lasting, in particular bringing greatly increased rainfall.[171][168] Sea level rise added to the resulting problems.[169] According to officials from the Harris County Flood Control District, Harvey caused the third '500-year' flood in three years. [172][173][174] The National Climate Assessment states:\\r\\nThe recent increases in activity are linked, in part, to higher sea surface temperatures in the region that Atlantic hurricanes form in and move through. Numerous factors have been shown to influence these local sea surface temperatures, including natural variability, human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases, and particulate pollution. Quantifying the relative contributions of natural and human-caused factors is an active focus of research.[175]\\r\\nWarmer air can hold more water vapour, in accordance with the ClausiusÿClapeyron relation, and there has been a global increase of daily rainfall records.[169] Regional sea surface temperatures around Houston have risen around 0.5?C (0.9?F) in recent decades, which caused a 3ÿ5% increase in moisture in the atmosphere. This had the effect of allowing Harvey to strengthen more than expected.[167] The water temperature of the Gulf of Mexico was above average for this time of the year, and likely to be a factor in Harvey's impact.[176] Within a week of Harvey Hurricane Irma formed due to the same unusually warm sea-water. Some scientists fear this may be becoming a 'new normal'. Also higher sea-water temperatures can make hurricanes more devastating.[177]\\r\\nThe slow movement of Harvey over Texas allowed the storm to drop prolonged heavy rains on the state, as has also happened with earlier storms.[160] Harvey's stalled position was due to weak prevailing winds linked to a greatly expanded subtropical high pressure system over much of the US at the time, which had pushed the jet stream to the north. Research and model simulations have indicated an association between this pattern and human-caused climate change.[167][178]\\r\\nOther tropical cyclones that made landfall in the same region of the Texas Gulf coast:","input":"Was harvey a hurricane or a tropical storm?"},{"output":"for treatment of osteoarthritis","context":"Chondroitin sulfate is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) composed of a chain of alternating sugars (N-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid). It is usually found attached to proteins as part of a proteoglycan. A chondroitin chain can have over 100 individual sugars, each of which can be sulfated in variable positions and quantities. Chondroitin sulfate is an important structural component of cartilage and provides much of its resistance to compression.[1] Along with glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate has become a widely used dietary supplement for treatment of osteoarthritis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough chondroitin is used in dietary supplements as an alternative medicine to treat osteoarthritis and also approved and regulated as a symptomatic slow-acting drug for this disease (SYSADOA) in Europe and some other countries, it is technically neither a medicine nor a disease-modifying treatment.[2][3] See Clinical effects below. It is commonly sold together with glucosamine. Chondroitin and glucosamine are also used in veterinary medicine.[4] Formulated with collagen and wound dressing matrix, one product that uses chondroitin sulfate is the veterinary wound gel Chondroprotec, which is applied over scrapes, burns, and lesions and serves to keep the wound moist and promote healing.[5]\\r\\nChondroitin, along with commonly used glucosamine, should not be used to treat patients who have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee as evidence shows that these treatments fail to provide relief for that condition.[6]\\r\\nClinical studies have not identified any significant side effects or overdoses of chondroitin sulfate, which suggest its long-term safety.[7] The Task Force of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) committee recently granted chondroitin sulfate a level of toxicity of 6 in a 0-100 scale, confirming it is one of the safest drugs for osteoarthritis.[2] Moreover, its safety is supported by an absence of drug-drug interactions (chondroitin sulfate is not metabolized by cytochrome P450),[8] and the lack of safe alternatives for patients multi-medicated for osteoarthritis and other accompanying diseases, e.g. diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, etc.\\r\\nChondroitin sulfate chains are unbranched polysaccharides of variable length containing two alternating monosaccharides: D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc). Some GlcA residues are epimerized into L-iduronic acid (IdoA); the resulting disaccharide is then referred to as dermatan sulfate.\\r\\nChondroitin sulfate chains are linked to hydroxyl groups on serine residues of certain proteins. Exactly how proteins are selected for attachment of glycosaminoglycans is not understood. Glycosylated serines are often followed by a glycine and have neighboring acidic residues, but this motif does not always predict glycosylation.\\r\\nAttachment of the GAG chain begins with four monosaccharides in a fixed pattern: Xyl - Gal - Gal - GlcA. Each sugar is attached by a specific enzyme, allowing for multiple levels of control over GAG synthesis. Xylose begins to be attached to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, while the rest of the sugars are attached in the Golgi apparatus.[9]\\r\\nChondroitin's functions depend largely on the properties of the overall proteoglycan of which it is a part. These functions can be broadly divided into structural and regulatory roles. However, this division is not absolute, and some proteoglycans have both structural and regulatory roles (see versican).\\r\\nThe effect of chondroitin sulfate in patients with osteoarthritis is likely the result of a number of reactions including its anti-inflammatory activity, the stimulation of the synthesis of proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid, and the decrease in catabolic activity of chondrocytes inhibiting the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes, nitric oxide, and other substances that contribute to damage cartilage matrix and cause death of articular chondrocytes. A recent review summarizes data from relevant reports describing the biochemical basis of the effect of chondroitin sulfate on osteoarthritis articular tissues.[10] The rationale behind the use of chondroitin sulfate is based on the belief that osteoarthritis is associated with a local deficiency or degradation of natural substances, including internal chondroitin sulfate.\\r\\nRecently, new mechanisms of action have been described for chondroitin sulfate. In an in vitro study, chondroitin sulfate reduced the IL-1-induced nuclear factor-kB (NF-B) translocation in chondrocytes.[11] In addition, chondroitin sulfate has recently shown a positive effect on osteoarthritic structural changes occurred in the subchondral bone.[12]\\r\\nA review published in the Annals of Rheumatic Diseases describes all the documented evidence regarding the mechanisms of action of chondroitin sulfate[13]\\r\\nPharmacokinetic studies performed on humans and experimental animals after oral administration of chondroitin sulfate revealed that it can be absorbed orally. Chondroitin sulfate shows first-order kinetics up to single doses of 3,000?mg.[14][15][16][17] Multiple doses of 800?mg in patients with osteoarthritis do not alter the kinetics of chondroitin sulfate. The bioavailability of chondroitin sulfate ranges from 15% to 24% of the orally administered dose. More particularly, on the articular tissue, Ronca et al.[18] reported that chondroitin sulfate is not rapidly absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract and a high content of labeled chondroitin sulfate is found in the synovial fluid and cartilage.\\r\\nA 2015 Cochrane review of clinical trials found that most were of low quality, but that there was some evidence of short-term improvement in pain and few side effects; it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints.[19]\\r\\nThe most relevant recently conducted clinical trials performed with chondroitin sulfate are summarized below.\\r\\nThe largest trial conducted with the product is the Glucosamine and Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT), a double-blind, randomized, multicenter clinical trial sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health in 1583 patients with knee osteoarthritis, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (Clegg DO, et al. 2006).[20] Patients were randomly assigned to one of five orally administered treatments: two 250?mg capsules of glucosamine hydrochloride three times daily, two 200?mg capsules of chondroitin sulphate three times daily, two capsules of 250?mg of glucosamine hydrochloride plus 200?mg of chondroitin sulphate three times daily, 200?mg of celecoxib daily, or placebo. Treatment was administered for 24 weeks.\\r\\nThe primary outcome measure was a 20% decrease in the WOMAC pain subscale from baseline to week 24. The analysis of the primary outcome data for all patients showed the percentage of responders in each group to be: glucosamine: 64.0%; chondroitin sulphate: 65.4%; glucosamine + chondroitin sulphate: 66.6%; and celecoxib: 70.1% (p=0.008). Thus, despite the considerable effect elicited by all the products, only the celecoxib group reached statistical significance. This has been discussed by the authors and attributed mainly to the unprecedented high response in the placebo group (60.1%) and the relatively mild degree of pain among participants, which may have limited the ability to detect treatment benefits. Indeed, treatment effects were more substantial in patients with moderate-to-severe pain. Analysis of the results for the primary outcome, based on higher baseline pain, showed the percentage of responders in each treatment group to be 54.3% for placebo; 61.4% for chondroitin sulphate; 65.7% for glucosamine hydrochloride; 69.4% for celecoxib; and 79.2% for combined glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate. Thus, in the higher WOMAC pain stratum, only the combination glucosamine + chondroitin group presented significant efficacy (p=0.002).\\r\\nSecondary efficacy outcome measures were as follows: OMERACT-OARSI response, 50% decrease in WOMAC pain score, WOMAC pain, stiffness and function score, normalized WOMAC score, patient and investigator global evaluations of disease status and response to study medication, evaluation of the index knee for swelling and tenderness, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Alternative Disability score and HAQ Pain score, clinical evaluation for adverse reactions and reconciliation of study medications and rescue analgesia use. Analysis of the OMERACT-OARSI measure in all randomized patients revealed statistical significance for both celecoxib (p=0.007) and glucosamine and chondroitin in combination (P=0.02) compared to placebo. Swelling of study joints was significantly less in patients in the chondroitin sulphate (P=0.01) and celecoxib (P=0.03) treatment arms. Differences in the other secondary outcomes were not statistically significant when compared across the 5 treatment arms for all patients. For patients with moderate-to-severe pain at baseline (n=354), a statistically significant difference was observed in favor of the glucosamine and chondroitin combination group versus placebo for the following efficacy outcomes: 20% decrease in WOMAC pain score (0.002); OMERACT-OARSI response (0.001); 50% decrease in WOMAC pain score (0.02); WOMAC pain score (0.009); WOMAC function score (0.008); normalised WOMAC score (0.017); Health Assessment Questionnaire Pain score (0.03).\\r\\nWhile the combination therapy of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate significantly reduced knee pain in the moderate-to-severe pain subgroup, Clegg et al. (2006)[21] state that another trial needs to confirm their results. The authors also note that there was a small number of patients in the moderate-to-severe pain subgroup, which could have limited the studys power to demonstrate efficacy. It is concerning that glucosamine and chondroitin in this study only showed efficacy in combination. The essential goal of experimental design is to isolate a variable (Stanovich, 1992),[22] but glucosamine and chondroitin isolated were not effective in any group, including the moderate-to-severe pain subgroup. It is possible that when glucosamine and chondroitin interact there is a synergistic effect; however, a synergistic effect has not been proven (Singh, Noorbalochi, MacDonald, & Maxwell, 2016).[23] Additionally, it would be uncommon if a medication was only effective for moderate-to-severe pain and not for mild pain (Hall, 2008).[24]\\r\\nA subanalysis of GAIT results based on interaction of Kellgren & Lawrence Grade and Chondroitin Sulfate response relative to placebo was performed by the same study investigators.[25] The results indicated better response for chondroitin sulfate relative to placebo for Kellgren & Lawrence grade 2 compared with grade 3. In general, chondroitin sulfate response within the Kellgren & Lawrence grade 2 group was very similar to that seen for celecoxib. These results suggest that chondroitin sulfate may improve osteoarthritis knee pain in patients with relatively early radiographic disease.\\r\\nSawitzke A, et al. 2010[26] evaluated the efficacy and safety of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, alone or in combination, as well as celecoxib and placebo on painful knee osteoarthritis over 2 years as a continuation of the GAIT trial. This was a 24-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, enrolling 662 patients with knee osteoarthritis who satisfied radiographic criteria (Kellgren/Lawrence grade 2 or 3 changes and baseline joint space width of at least 2?mm). This subset continued to receive their randomized treatment (glucosamine 500?mg three times daily, chondroitin sulfate 400?mg three times daily, the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, celecoxib 200?mg daily, or placebo) over 24 months. The primary outcome was a 20% reduction in pain over 24 months as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Secondary outcomes included an Outcome Measures in Rheumatology/Osteoarthritis Research Society International response and change from baseline in WOMAC pain and function. Over 2 years, none of the treatments (not even the positive control celecoxib) achieved a clinically important difference in WOMAC pain or function as compared with placebo. Adverse reactions were similar among treatment groups and serious adverse events were rare for all treatments.\\r\\nA recent study called the CONCEPT trial (Reginster, Dudler, Blicharski, & Pavelka, 2017)[27] investigated the efficacy of chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, and celecoxib in the management of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. A 6 month, double-blind, double-dummy experiment using 604 patients with knee osteoarthritis was conducted. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups: 1. One tablet of pharmaceutical grade chondroitin sulfate 800?mg and one placebo capsule of celecoxib 2. One capsule of celecoxib 200?mg and one placebo tablet of chondroitin sulfate 3. One placebo capsule of celecoxib and one placebo tablet of chondroitin sulfate. Patients in all groups were required to take their capsules and tablets once daily in the evening. The CONCEPT trial (Reginster et al., 2017)[28] found that chondroitin sulfate was as effective as celecoxib. The authors stated that an 800?mg/day pharmaceutical-grade tablet of chondroitin sulfate should be considered first-line treatment in the medical management of knee OA. Despite this claim, there are still reasons to remain skeptical. Firstly, the study was sponsored by the manufacturer of Condrosulf and the pharmaceutical grade chondroitin sulfate used in the study was Condrosulf (Hall, 2017).[29] This does not discredit the study, but could be a possible warning sign. A Cochrane review in 2016 (Singh et al., 2016)[30] found that overall, in studies funded by chondroitin sulfate manufacturers, participants in the chondroitin group had significantly better pain scores than participants in the placebo, whereas studies who did not specify their funding did not show this difference. Additionally, Condrosulf is not available in the United States; thus, it is unknown if pharmaceutical grade chondroitin sulfate in the United States is comparable (Hall, 2017).[29]\\r\\nChondroitin sulfate was originally isolated well before the structure was characterised, leading to changes in terminology with time.[31] Early researchers identified different fractions of the substance with letters.\\r\\n\\"Chondroitin sulfate B\\" is an old name for dermatan sulfate, and it is no longer classified as a form of chondroitin sulfate.[32]\\r\\nChondroitin, without the \\"sulfate\\", has been used to describe a fraction with little or no sulfation.[33] However, this distinction is not used by all.\\r\\nAlthough the name \\"chondroitin sulfate\\" suggests a salt with a sulfate counter-anion, this is not the case, as sulfate is covalently bonded to the sugar. Rather, since the molecule has multiple negative charges at physiological pH, a cation is present in salts of chondroitin sulfate. Commercial preparations of chondroitin sulfate typically are the sodium salt. Barnhill et al. have suggested that all such preparations of chondroitin sulfate be referred to as \\"sodium chondroitin\\" regardless of their sulfation status.[34]\\r\\nMost chondroitin appears to be made from extracts of cartilaginous cow and pig tissues (cow trachea and pig ear and nose), but other sources such as shark, fish, and bird cartilage are also used. Since chondroitin is not a uniform substance, and is naturally present in a wide variety of forms, the precise composition of each supplement will vary.[34] In fact, although many food supplement companies produce their products in compliance with human food processing Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), most of them do not produce their products in compliance with the GMP regulations for pharmaceuticals, resulting in products without pharmaceutical requirements.[35] Companies have attempted to produce chondroitin from other substances but have not yet had success.\\r\\nRecent testing has revealed several flaws in the older testing methods. Without knowing the source of the chondroitin (e.g., shark, porcine, or bovine) and the approximate age of the animal, it is impossible to get a reliable reference standard, and, thus, results from previous testing had yielded percentages between 50 and 400%. In 2007, David Ji et al. reported in the Journal of Analytical Chemistry an extremely accurate method of quantification. The method included using an enzyme to break the chondroitin into its individual unsaturated disaccharides, and then measuring them using HPLC with an ion-pairing column and UV detection.[36]\\r\\nWhile it is a prescription or over-the-counter drug in 22 countries, chondroitin is regulated in the U.S. as a dietary supplement[37] by the Food and Drug Administration. In Europe, chondroitin sulfate formulations are approved as drugs with evidenced efficacy and safety demonstrated by clinical trials in osteoarthritic patients.[38] Adebowale et al. reported in 2000 that of 32 chondroitin supplements they analysed, only 5 were labeled correctly, and more than half contained less than 40% of the labeled amount.[39] With the introduction of GMP regulations for dietary supplements in 2008, chondroitin sulfate preparations are subject in the US to mandatory labeling standards as well as testing requirements for identity, purity, strength, and composition.[citation needed] United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) testing standards for the identification and quantification of chondroitin are well-established.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere are no FDA regulations on chondroitin sulfate as a food additive, as it is recognized by the FDA as a component of food and is \\"generally recognized as safe\\".[40] However, a proposed application of chondroitin sulfate dietary supplement as a means of preventing joint degeneration was highly scrutinized by the FDA, who stated:\\r\\n\\" For conventional foods, this evaluation involves considering whether the ingredient that is the source of the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS), approved as a food additive, or authorized by a prior sanction issued by FDA (see 21 CFR 101.70(f)). Dietary ingredients in dietary supplements, however, are not subject to the food additive provisions of the act (see section 201(s)(6) of the Act (21 U.S.C.  321(s)(6)). Rather, they are subject to the adulteration provisions in section 402 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 342) and, if applicable, the new dietary ingredient provisions in section 413 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 350b), which pertain to dietary ingredients that were not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994.\\"\\r\\nIn the same letter, the FDA found that studies performed on the dietary supplement form of chondroitin sulfate were insufficient to substantiate claims that it is efficacious in the prevention of joint deterioration, and denied the request to be allowed to label the supplement as such. They further denied the request to market it as safe, given that no human clinical trials were done, citing that animal studies are not sufficient for the approval of a dietary supplement.[40]\\r\\nIn 2004, a petition was submitted to the FDA that a dietary supplement of chondroitin sulfate be labeled as reducing the risk of osteoarthritis, cartilage deterioration, and osteoarthritis-related joint pain, tenderness, and swelling. The FDA denied the request, stating that experiments conducted by the company did not sufficiently demonstrate the effectiveness of the claim. Among other comments, the FDA noted the poor experimental design of some trials.[40]\\r\\nIn 2007, Reichenbach et al. used explicit methods to conduct and report a systematic review of 20 trials and concluded \\"large-scale, methodologically sound trials indicate that the symptomatic benefit of chondroitin is minimal or nonexistent. Use of chondroitin in routine clinical practice should therefore be discouraged.\\" In contrast, and also in 2007, Bruyere et al. concluded that \\"there is compelling evidence that glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate may interfere with progression of OA.\\"\\r\\nOn Wednesday, March 19, 2008 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified \\"oversulfated chondroitin sulfate\\" as a contaminant in heparin originating from China.[41]\\r\\nIn this regard, \\"it is very important to remark on the relevant chemical differences between the chondroitin sulfate formulation approved in Europe as a drug and considered the reference product, and the \\"oversulfated chondroitin sulfate\\" identified as a contaminant in heparin originating from China.\\"\\r\\nThe \\"oversulfated chondroitin sulfate\\" is not a product extracted from biological sources; it is synthesized through a sulfation reaction from the biological molecule. This is a semi-synthesis process that uses naturally derived chondroitin sulfate as a reagent in combination with various potentially dangerous chemicals, though their significance in the toxicity of \\"oversulfated chondroitin sulfate\\" is not known.\\r\\nThe resulting product contains 3 or 4 sulfate groups per disaccharide, and, therefore, its structure differs considerably from the original one (see #Sulfation section above). Furthermore, analysis of the contaminant unexpectedly revealed an unusual type of sulfation not found in any natural sources of chondroitin sulfate. In addition, a tetrasulfated disaccharide repeat unit has not been isolated to date from animal tissues[42]\\r\\nThus, chondroitin sulfate is merely the substrate of the reaction: The final, oversulfated molecule constitutes a new entity, whose pharmacological and clinical properties are most likely very different from the biological molecule, as it is demonstrated in a recent article published in New England Journal of Medicine. In this study,[43] Sasisekharan and colleagues showed that the oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS) found in contaminated lots of unfractionated heparin, as well as a synthetically generated OSCS reference standard, directly activated the kininÿkallikrein pathway in human plasma, which can lead to the generation of bradykinin, a potent vasoactive mediator. In addition, OSCS induced generation of C3a and C5a, potent anaphylatoxins derived from complement proteins. Chondroitin sulfate A was also tested and it showed no induction of amidollytic activity. Screening of plasma samples from various species indicated that swine and humans are sensitive to the effects of OSCS in a similar manner. OSCS-containing heparin and synthetically derived OSCS-induced hypotension associated with kallikrein activation when administered by intravenous infusion in swine. In contrast, none of the three pigs treated with chondroitin sulfate A showed any significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate.","input":"Why would someone take a chondroitin sulfate supplement?"},{"output":"Indian Ocean","context":"\\r\\nHydrophis belcheri, commonly known as the faint-banded sea snake or Belcher's sea snake, is a venomous species of elapid sea snake. It has a timid temperament and would normally have to be subjected to severe mistreatment before biting. Usually those bitten are fishermen handling nets, although only a quarter of those bitten are envenomated since the snake rarely injects much of its venom. Because of this, and its docile nature, it is generally not regarded as very dangerous. Although not much is known about the venom of this species,[2] its LD50 toxicity in mice has been determined to be 0.24?mg/kg[3] when delivered intramuscularly.\\r\\nBelcher's sea snake, which many times is mistakenly called the hook-nosed sea snake (Enhydrina schistosa), has been erroneously popularized as the most venomous snake in the world, due to Ernst and Zug's published book \\"Snakes in Question: The Smithsonian Answer Book\\" from 1996. Associate Professor Bryan Grieg Fry, a prominent venom expert, has clarified the error: \\"The hook nosed myth was due to a fundamental error in a book called 'Snakes in question'.

Its mouth is very small but suitable for aquatic life. Its body when viewed out of water appears to have a faint yellow colour.

The series was created by Matt Williams, Carmen Finestra, and David McFadzean. In the 1990s, it was one of the most watched sitcoms in the American market, winning many awards. The series launched Tim Allen's acting career and was the start of the television career of Pamela Anderson, who was part of the recurring cast for the first two seasons.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the stand-up comedy of Tim Allen, Home Improvement made its debut on ABC on September 17, 1991,[2] and was one of the highest-rated sitcoms for almost the entire decade.

Originally, the project's proposed title was Hammer Time, both a play on the catchphrase made popular by artist MC Hammer and the name of the fictional fix-it show within the series, which was also called Hammer Time. By the time ABC committed to the project in early 1991, Allen and his team had already changed the title to Home Improvement. The show hosted by Tim Taylor in the shooting script for Home Improvement was still called Hammer Time when the first pilot with Frances Fisher was filmed in April 1991. The catalyst for the series' name change was to represent the aspect of fixing problems within the family and home life, as well as the use of mechanics and tools. Once the second phase of the pilot was produced, with all the actors that made the final cut into the series (including Patricia Richardson), Tim Taylor's Hammer Time became Tool Time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first filmed pilot was produced in April 1991, with Frances Fisher playing Jill Taylor. Fisher, primarily known as a dramatic actress, was well qualified for the co-starring role but was viewed by the studio audience as not being comedic enough, and too serious in her line delivery. The producers tried to work with Fisher on adapting to the situation comedy setting, but shortly after the pilot wrapped post-production, they decided to recast her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the first pilot was shot, actor John Bedford Lloyd was in the running for one of two roles; that of Tim's Tool Time assistant (originally named \\"Glen\\") and the role of Wilson. Bedford Lloyd eventually got the part of Wilson, but his agent later made claims that the actor was unaware that most of his scenes would require his face to be partially hidden behind a fence. For this reason, the crew received news just one day prior to taping the first pilot that Bedford-Lloyd had dropped out. Casting immediately contacted the other actor considered for the role, Earl Hindman.\\r\\n\\r\\nStephen Tobolowsky was tapped to play the Tool Time co-host, Glen. However, he was still busy with a movie that was in the middle of production at the time the first pilot was to be shot. Therefore, the producers set out to cast an alternate character that would stand in as Tim's co-host for the pilot, or for however many episodes were required until Tobolowsky was available. The casting department auditioned Richard Karn, for what would be his first major appearance on a TV sitcom; the character of Al Borland was created from there. After the first few episodes completed with Patricia Richardson as Jill, Tobolowsky was still tied up with his other commitments, and Karn found himself in his role permanently when Tobolowsky decided he would have no time to do a series. Thus, the character of Glen never came into being.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first two years of the show, Pamela Anderson played the part of Tim's Tool Girl, Lisa, on Tool Time, but left the show to focus on her role on the syndicated series Baywatch. Her last episode as a series regular was \\"The Great Race\\", which aired on May 19, 1993. Tim's new assistant, Heidi, played by Debbe Dunning, replaced Anderson as the Tool Time Girl for the following third season, starting with \\"Maybe Baby\\", which aired on September 15, 1993. Anderson did reprise the role of Lisa on the sixth-season finale episode \\"The Kiss and the Kiss-Off\\", which aired on May 20, 1997.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the show's eighth season and final season, the middle child Randy left for an environmental study program in Costa Rica in the episode \\"Adios\\", which aired on September 29, 1998. This was done because Jonathan Taylor Thomas reportedly wanted to take time off to focus on academics. His last appearance on Home Improvement was the eighth and final season's Christmas episode \\"Home for the Holidays\\", which aired on December 8, 1998.  He did not return to the show for the series finale, aired in May 1999, only appearing in archived footage. He was shooting the film Speedway Junky for release that summer. His character was not replaced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series centers on the Taylor family, which consists of Tim (Tim Allen), his wife Jill (Patricia Richardson) and their three children: the oldest child, Brad (Zachery Ty Bryan), the middle child, Randy (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) and youngest child, Mark (Taran Noah Smith). The Taylors live in suburban Detroit, and have a neighbor named Wilson (Earl Hindman) who is often the go-to guy for solving the Taylors' problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nTim is a stereotypical American male, who loves power tools, cars, and sports. In particular, he is an avid fan of local Detroit teams. In numerous instances, Tim wears Lions, Pistons, Red Wings, and Tigers clothing, and many plots revolve around the teams. He is a former salesman for the fictional Binford Tool company, and is very much a cocky, overambitious, accident-prone know-it-all. Witty but flippant, Tim jokes around a lot, even at inappropriate times, much to the dismay of his wife. However, Tim can sometimes be serious when necessary. Jill, Tim's wife, is loving and sophisticated, but not exempt from dumb moves herself. In later seasons she returns to college to study psychology. Family life is boisterous for the Taylors with the two oldest children, Brad and Randy, tormenting the much younger Mark, all while continually testing and pestering each other. Such play happened especially throughout the first three seasons, and was revisited only occasionally until Jonathan Taylor Thomas left at the beginning of the eighth season. During the show's final season, Brad and Mark became much closer due to Randy's absence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrad, popular and athletic, was often the moving factor, who engaged before thinking, a tendency which regularly landed him in trouble. Randy, a year younger, was the comedian of the pack, known for his quick-thinking, wisecracks, and smart mouth. He had more common sense than Brad but was not immune to trouble. Mark was somewhat of a mama's boy, though later in the series (in the seventh season) he grew into a teenage outcast who dressed in black clothing.  Meanwhile, Brad became interested in cars like his father and took up soccer. Randy joined the school drama club, and later the school newspaper; in the eighth season, he left for Costa Rica.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early seasons, Wilson was always seen standing on the other side of Tim's backyard fence as the two engaged in conversation, usually with Wilson offering sage advice as Tim grappled with his problems.  In later seasons, a running joke developed in which more and more creative means were used to prevent Wilson's face below the eyes from ever being seen by the audience.  Also in later seasons, Wilson's full name was revealed to be Wilson W. Wilson, Jr.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach episode includes Tim's own Binford-sponsored home improvement show, called Tool Time, a \\"meta-program,\\" or show-within-a-show. In hosting this show, Tim is joined by his friend and mild-mannered assistant Al Borland (Richard Karn), and a \\"Tool Time girl\\"first Lisa (Pamela Anderson) and later Heidi (Debbe Dunning)whose main duty is to introduce the pair at the beginning of the show with the line \\"Does everybody know what time it is?\\" The Tool Time girl also assists Tim and Al during the show by bringing them tools.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough revealed to be an excellent salesman and TV personality, Tim is spectacularly accident prone as a handyman, often causing massive disasters on and off the set, to the consternation of his co-workers and family. Many Tool Time viewers assume that the accidents on the show are done on purpose, to demonstrate the consequences of using tools improperly. Many of Tim's accidents are caused by his devices being used in an unorthodox or overpowered manner, designed to illustrate his mantra \\"More power!\\". This popular catchphrase would not be uttered after Home Improvement's seventh season,[5] until Tim's last line in the series finale, which are the last two words ever spoken.\\r\\n\\r\\nTool Time was conceived as a parody of the PBS home-improvement show This Old House.[6]  Tim and Al are caricatures of the two principal cast members of This Old House, host Bob Vila and master carpenter Norm Abram.[7] Al Borland has a beard and always wears plaid shirts when taping an episode, reflecting Norm Abram's appearance on This Old House.[8] Bob Vila appeared as a guest star on several episodes of Home Improvement, while Tim Allen and Pamela Anderson both appeared on Bob Vila's show Home Again.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tool Time theme music, an early 1960s-style saxophone-dominated instrumental rock tune, was sometimes used as the closing theme music for Home Improvement, especially when behind the credits were running the blooper scenes that took place during the taping of a Tool Time segment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme music for Home Improvement was composed by Dan Foliart. The theme song is unique for its sampling of power tools, most notably an electric drill and jackhammer, which is heard during theme song. Tim's grunting was also sampled for the theme song. The flute and organ parts of the theme music were also used. From Season 7 until the end of the series, a remixed version of the theme song was used.\\r\\n\\r\\nHome Improvement received numerous awards and nominations in its 8-season run. Notable awards and nominations include: Golden Globe Awards, Primetime Emmy Awards, Kids' Choice Awards, Young Artist Awards, YoungStar Awards, ASCAP Award, and many others.\\r\\n\\r\\nWatchMojo.com ranked Home Improvement as the #9 TV sitcom from the 1990s. The character with most honors was Wilson, who was ranked as the #6 unseen TV character and as the #3 TV neighbor. Binford made it to the #10 fictional brand. The video game Home Improvement: Power Tool Pursuit! was ranked as the #5 worst game based on a TV series. On Metacritic, the first season holds a score of 64 out of 100, based on 18 critics and the second season holds a score of 75 out of 100, based on 5 critics, both indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the show, Tim Taylor would often be wearing sweatshirts or T-shirts from various Michigan-based colleges and universities. These were usually sent by the schools to the show for him to wear during an episode.[11] Because Allen considered Michigan his home state, the rule was that only Michigan schools would get the free advertising.[12] There were two notable exceptions to the general rule that Tim only supported Michigan educational institutions on the show. First, during the episode Workshop 'Til You Drop  Tim wears a Wofford College sweatshirt.[13] Second, during the episode The Wood, the Bad and the Hungry  Tim wears an Owens Community College sweatshirt.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Allen, Richard Karn, Casey Sander, and Debbe Dunning had a reunion in a television special named Tim Allen Presents: A User's Guide to Home Improvement in 2003 (a terminally ill Earl Hindman did voice-overs, befitting his never-seen persona of Wilson).[59] Allen presented his own favorite clips from the show, insider's tips, personal reflections and a question and answer session with the live audience. The special is included on the season 8 DVD set.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 3, 2011, in Pacific Palisades, California, the surviving main cast members reunited for Entertainment Weekly magazine, including Jonathan Taylor Thomas, whom the cast had not seen since 1998.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Karn guest starred in two episodes of Tim Allen's 2010s ABC sitcom Last Man Standing in 2013.[61][62] Jonathan Taylor Thomas has also appeared on Last Man Standing,[63] and has directed episodes of the series.[64][65]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, Patricia Richardson guest starred on Last Man Standing in the episode \\"Helen Potts\\", playing the episode's titular character.[66] Jonathan Taylor Thomas made a cameo in the episode, playing Richardson's son.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 5, 2015, Hollywood Life reported that Tim Allen and Richard Karn had admitted talking about getting back together as a cast for a Home Improvement reboot or reunion show. Karn was quoted saying \\"There is always a chance, absolutely. Would I be on board? Yeah I think so! I would love to see what the story lines could be, it could be very funny!\\"[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series finale became the fifth highest-rated series finale television program of the 1990s and the ninth overall series finale ever presented on a single network in television history, watched by 35.5 percent of the households sampled in America, and 21.6 percent of television viewers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, Home Improvement began airing in broadcast syndication in September 1995, distributed via Buena Vista Television (now DisneyÿABC Domestic Television) and continued to be syndicated until 2007; in a manner similar to Seinfeld and The Simpsons after they began airing in broadcast syndication, episodes of Home Improvement were not aired in order of their production code number or original airdate. It has previously aired on cable television via TBS from 2002 to 2013, and WGN America from 2002 to 2007.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt also aired on Nick at Nite from September 3, 2007 to October 2009[69] and again on Monday mornings only starting on September 27, 2010. It aired on TV Land from January 4, 2010 to 2013. The show aired on The Hallmark Channel from September 3, 2013 until January 2016. The Hallmark Channel aired Home Improvement Monday through Friday at 2 p.m. ET until 6 p.m. ET[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdding to its continuing popularity on American cable networks, it was reported on March 7, 2018, that Laff TV (an E.W. Scripps Company subsidiary) signed a broadcast licensing agreement with Disney-ABC Television Group in order to air the show.[71] On May 2, 2018, it was reported that Uptv had also obtained broadcast rights from Disney-ABC Television Group to air all eight seasons.[72] Uptv airs back to back episodes Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. ET.[73] Episodes on Uptv also air Saturday afternoons.[74] As of June 5, 2018, Home Improvement airs on Laff TV from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside America, reruns have aired on The Disney Channel, Channel 4 and ABC1 in the UK. Originally, Home Improvement was aired on Channel 4 and then later the Disney Channel; however, in 2005, it began broadcasting on ABC1. On September 26, 2007, ABC1 ceased transmissions and no official announcement was made as to which channels would be broadcasting ABC1's previous programming. Although the show stopped airing in the UK due to ABC1 ceasing transmission on September 26, on July 28, 2008, it restarted from the pilot episode on Virgin 1. However, it was announced that Virgin 1 (now Channel One) would close on January 31, 2011, and no announcement was made regarding its broadcast future in the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, it previously aired on CTV from the beginning to the ending (1991ÿ1999), as well as CMT and YTV. In Germany and Austria, Home Improvement has been shown in dubbing under the title H?r mal wer da h?mmert (\\"Listen who's hammering\\"). It ran on ARD (1993ÿ1995), RTL (1996ÿ2006), RTL II (1999ÿ2000, 2007ÿ2012), VOX (2004ÿ2006), and Super RTL (2008ÿ2009). Currently, reruns in Germany air Mondays at 15:20 hours (3:20 p.m. German time) on RTL Nitro.[75] In Austria, reruns aired for a period of time on ATV. It was also shown on M-Net in South Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn New Zealand, reruns of the show currently air weekdays at 2 p.m. on the state-owned channel TVNZ 2.[76] In 2011, Asian Network Star World started broadcasting the show in place of The Simpsons. Additionally, reruns have aired on the Seven Network and 111 Hits in Australia, Disney Channel in India, and Hits (TV channel) in South East Asia, including Macau, Singapore and Taiwan.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 29, 2017, Home Improvement became available for streaming on Hulu along with fellow DisneyÿABC television properties Dinosaurs and Boy Meets World, in addition to fellow ABC programs Family Matters, Full House, Hangin' with Mr. Cooper, Perfect Strangers and Step by Step.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment has released all eight seasons on DVD in Region 1, 2 and 4. Season 8 has the \\"Backstage Pass\\" (which immediately followed \\"The Long and Winding Road, Part III\\") and the reunion show on the fourth disc of the set.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 10, 2011, Walt Disney Studios released a complete series box set entitled Home Improvement: 20th Anniversary Complete Collection on DVD in Region 1. The 25-disc collection features all 204 episodes of the series as well as all special features contained on the previously released season sets; it is encased in special collectible packaging, a Home Improvement toolbox with a Binford \\"All-In-One Tool\\" tape measure.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Region 1 DVDs are on three discs (with the exception of the final season set, which has four discs), whereas the Region 2 DVDs are presented across four discs, but in Germany the fourth to seventh seasons are also three disc sets.  The Region 2 packaging and programme menus for Season 1 vary compared to the Region 1 releases. The Season 3 menus in Region 1 are in widescreen, but 4:3 in Region 2. The Region 1 releases of Seasons 2 and 3 consist of (deliberate) \\"holes\\" in the outer packagingthese do not exist in the Region 2 releases; in fact, the Season 3 outer packaging is physically printed where the hole would be in the Region 1 packaging.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeasons 5 and 6 accidentally contain some slightly edited episodes, most likely due to using syndication prints. And the episode \\"The Feminine Mistake\\" from season 6, doesn't contain the 3D version of the episode as originally aired on ABC, instead using the 2D version as seen in syndication.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been mentioned on review sites about the lack of episode commentaries and bonus features on the DVDs (except unaired blooper reels).  In an interview on About.com,[80] Tim Allen stated that it was a done deal that the DVDs would not contain interviews or episode commentaries. Whether this was before or after someone at Disney ordered the three commentaries available on the Season 1 DVDs is unknown.","input":"What city does home improvement take place in?"},{"output":"centromere","context":"The centromere is the specialized DNA sequence of a chromosome that links a pair of sister chromatids (a dyad).[1] During mitosis, spindle fibers attach to the centromere via the kinetochore.[2] Centromeres were first thought to be genetic loci that direct the behavior of chromosomes.\\r\\nThe physical role of the centromere is to act as the site of assembly of the kinetochores ÿ a highly complex multiprotein structure that is responsible for the actual events of chromosome segregation ÿ i.e. binding microtubules and signalling to the cell cycle machinery when all chromosomes have adopted correct attachments to the spindle, so that it is safe for cell division to proceed to completion and for cells to enter anaphase.[3]\\r\\nThere are, broadly speaking, two types of centromeres. \\"Point centromeres\\" bind to specific proteins that recognize particular DNA sequences with high efficiency.[4] Any piece of DNA with the point centromere DNA sequence on it will typically form a centromere if present in the appropriate species. The best characterised point centromeres are those of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. \\"Regional centromeres\\" is the term coined to describe most centromeres, which typically form on regions of preferred DNA sequence, but which can form on other DNA sequences as well.[4] The signal for formation of a regional centromere appears to be epigenetic. Most organisms, ranging from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to humans, have regional centromeres.\\r\\nRegarding mitotic chromosome structure, centromeres represent a constricted region of the chromosome (often referred to as the primary constriction) where two identical sister chromatids are most closely in contact. When cells enter mitosis, the sister chromatids (the two copies of each chromosomal DNA molecule resulting from DNA replication in chromatin form) are linked along their length by the action of the cohesin complex. It is now believed that this complex is mostly released from chromosome arms during prophase, so that by the time the chromosomes line up at the mid-plane of the mitotic spindle (also known as the metaphase plate), the last place where they are linked with one another is in the chromatin in and around the centromere.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEach chromosome has two arms, labeled p (the shorter of the two) and q (the longer). Many remember that the short arm 'p' is named for the French word \\"petit\\" meaning 'small', although this explanation was shown to be apocryphal.[6] They can be connected in either metacentric, submetacentric, acrocentric or telocentric manner.[7][8]\\r\\nThese are X-shaped chromosomes, with the centromere in the middle so that the two arms of the chromosomes are almost equal.\\r\\nA chromosome is metacentric if its two arms are roughly equal in length. In a normal human karyotype, five chromosomes are considered metacentric: chromosomes 1, 3, 16, 19, and 20. In some cases, a metacentric chromosome is formed by balanced translocation: the fusion of two acrocentric chromosomes to form one metacentric chromosome.[9][10]\\r\\nIf arms' lengths are unequal, the chromosome is said to be submetacentric. Their shape is L shape.[11]\\r\\nIf the p (short) arm is so short that it is hard to observe, but still present, then the chromosome is acrocentric (the \\"acro-\\" in acrocentric refers to the Greek word for \\"peak\\"). The human genome includes six acrocentric chromosomes: 13, 14, 15, 21, 22 and the Y chromosome.[11]\\r\\nIn an acrocentric chromosome the p arm contains genetic material including repeated sequences such as nucleolar organizing regions, and can be translocated without significant harm, as in a balanced Robertsonian translocation. The domestic horse genome includes one metacentric chromosome that is homologous to two acrocentric chromosomes in the conspecific but undomesticated Przewalski's horse.[12] This may reflect either fixation of a balanced Robertsonian translocation in domestic horses or, conversely, fixation of the fission of one metacentric chromosome into two acrocentric chromosomes in Przewalski's horses. A similar situation exists between the human and great ape genomes; in this case, because more species are extant, it is apparent that the evolutionary sequence is a reduction of two acrocentric chromosomes in the great apes to one metacentric chromosome in humans (see Karyotype#Aneuploidy).[11]\\r\\nA telocentric chromosome's centromere is located at the terminal end of the chromosome. Telomeres may extend from both ends of the chromosome, their shape is similar to letter \\"i\\" during anaphase. For example, the standard house mouse karyotype has only telocentric chromosomes.[13][14] Humans do not possess telocentric chromosomes.\\r\\nIf the chromosome's centromere is located closer to its end than to its center, it may be described as subtelocentric.[15][16]\\r\\nWith holocentric chromosomes, the entire length of the chromosome acts as the centromere. Examples of this type of centromere can be found scattered throughout the plant and animal kingdoms,[17] with the most well-known example being the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.\\r\\nThere are two types of centromeres.[18] In regional centromeres, DNA sequences contribute to but do not define function. Regional centromeres contain large amounts of DNA and are often packaged into heterochromatin. In most eukaryotes, the centromere's DNA sequence consists of large arrays of repetitive DNA (e.g. satellite DNA) where the sequence within individual repeat elements is similar but not identical. In humans, the primary centromeric repeat unit is called ϫ-satellite (or alphoid), although a number of other sequence types are found in this region.[19]\\r\\nPoint centromeres are smaller and more compact. DNA sequences are both necessary and sufficient to specify centromere identity and function in organisms with point centromeres. In budding yeasts, the centromere region is relatively small (about 125 bp DNA) and contains two highly conserved DNA sequences that serve as binding sites for essential kinetochore proteins.[19]\\r\\nSince centromeric DNA sequence is not the key determinant of centromeric identity in metazoans, it is thought that epigenetic inheritance plays a major role in specifying the centromere.[20] The daughter chromosomes will assemble centromeres in the same place as the parent chromosome, independent of sequence. It has been proposed that histone H3 variant CENP-A (Centromere Protein A) is the epigenetic mark of the centromere.[21] The question arises whether there must be still some original way in which the centromere is specified, even if it is subsequently propagated epigenetically. If the centromere is inherited epigenetically from one generation to the next, the problem is pushed back to the origin of the first metazoans.\\r\\nThe centromeric DNA is normally in a heterochromatin state, which is essential for the recruitment of the cohesin complex that mediates sister chromatid cohesion after DNA replication as well as coordinating sister chromatid separation during anaphase. In this chromatin, the normal histone H3 is replaced with a centromere-specific variant, CENP-A in humans.[22] The presence of CENP-A is believed to be important for the assembly of the kinetochore on the centromere. CENP-C has been shown to localise almost exclusively to these regions of CENP-A associated chromatin. In human cells, the histones are found to be most enriched for H4K20me3 and H3K9me3[23] which are known heterochromatic modifications.\\r\\nIn the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (and probably in other eukaryotes), the formation of centromeric heterochromatin is connected to RNAi.[24] In nematodes such as Caenorhabditis elegans, some plants, and the insect orders Lepidoptera and Hemiptera, chromosomes are \\"holocentric\\", indicating that there is not a primary site of microtubule attachments or a primary constriction, and a \\"diffuse\\" kinetochore assembles along the entire length of the chromosome.\\r\\nIn rare cases in humans, neocentromeres can form at new sites on the chromosome. There are currently over 90 known human neocentromeres identified on 20 different chromosomes.[25][26] The formation of a neocentromere must be coupled with the inactivation of the previous centromere, since chromosomes with two functional centromeres (Dicentric chromosome) will result in chromosome breakage during mitosis. In some unusual cases human neocentromeres have been observed to form spontaneously on fragmented chromosomes. Some of these new positions were originally euchromatic and lack alpha satellite DNA altogether.\\r\\nCentromere proteins are also the autoantigenic target for some anti-nuclear antibodies, such as anti-centromere antibodies.\\r\\nIt has been known that centromere misregulation contributes to mis-segregation of chromosomes, which is strongly related to cancer and abortion. Notably, overexpression of many centromere genes have been linked to cancer malignant phenotypes. Overexpression of these centromere genes is thought to increase genomic instability in cancers. Elevated genomic instability on one hand relates to malignant phenotypes; on the other hand, it makes the tumor cells more vulnerable to specific adjuvant therapies such as certain chemotherapies and radiotherapy.[27] Instability of centromere repetitive DNA was recently shown in cancer and aging.[28]\\r\\nThe word centromere (/?s?ntr??m??r/[29][30]) uses combining forms of centro- and -mere, yielding \\"central part\\", describing the centromere's location at the center of the chromosome.","input":"What is the major constituent of a chromosome?"},{"output":"Galpagos tortoises are noted to live over 150 years, but an Aldabra giant tortoise named Adwaita may have been the longest living at an estimated 255 years.","context":"Tortoises (/?t??r.t?s.?z/) are a family, Testudinidae, of land-dwelling reptiles in the order Testudines. Tortoises are shielded from predators by a shell. The top part of the shell is the carapace, the underside is the plastron, and the two are connected by the bridge. The carapace is fused to both the vertebrae and ribcage, and tortoises are unique among vertebrates in that the pectoral and pelvic girdles are inside the ribcage rather than outside. Tortoises can vary in size from a few centimeters to two meters. They are usually diurnal animals with tendencies to be crepuscular depending on the ambient temperatures. They are generally reclusive animals. Tortoises are the longest living land animal in the world, although the longest living species of tortoise is a matter of debate. Galpagos tortoises are noted to live over 150 years, but an Aldabra giant tortoise named Adwaita may have been the longest living at an estimated 255 years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferences exist in usage of the common terms turtle, tortoise, and terrapin, depending on the variety of English being used; usage is inconsistent and contradictory.[1] These terms are common names and do not reflect precise biological or taxonomic distinctions.[2]\\r\\nThe American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists uses \\"turtle\\" to describe all species of the order Testudines, regardless of whether they are land-dwelling or sea-dwelling, and uses \\"tortoise\\" as a more specific term for slow-moving terrestrial species.[1] General American usage agrees; turtle is often a general term (although some restrict it to aquatic turtles); tortoise is used only in reference to terrestrial turtles or, more narrowly, only those members of Testudinidae, the family of modern land tortoises; and terrapin may refer to turtles that are small and live in fresh and brackish water, in particular the diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin).[3][4][5][6] In America, for example, the members of the genus Terrapene dwell on land, yet are referred to as box turtles rather than tortoises.[2]\\r\\nBritish usage, by contrast, tends not to use \\"turtle\\" as a generic term for all members of the order, and also applies the term \\"tortoises\\" broadly to all land-dwelling members of the order Testudines, regardless of whether they are actually members of the family Testudinidae.[6] In Britain, terrapin is used to refer to a larger group of semiaquatic turtles than the restricted meaning in America.[4][7]\\r\\nAustralian usage is different from both American and British usage.[6] Land tortoises are not native to Australia, yet traditionally freshwater turtles have been called \\"tortoises\\" in Australia.[8] Some Australian experts disapprove of this usagebelieving that the term tortoises is \\"better confined to purely terrestrial animals with very different habits and needs, none of which are found in this country\\"and promote the use of the term \\"freshwater turtle\\" to describe Australia's primarily aquatic members of the order Testudines because it avoids misleading use of the word \\"tortoise\\" and also is a useful distinction from marine turtles.[8]\\r\\nFemale tortoises dig nesting burrows in which they lay from 1 to 30 eggs.[9] Egg-laying typically occurs at night, after which the mother tortoise covers her clutch with sand, soil, and organic material. The eggs are left unattended, and depending on the species, take from 60 to 120 days to incubate.[10] The size of the egg depends on the size of the mother and can be estimated by examining the width of the cloacal opening between the carapace and plastron. The plastron of a female tortoise often has a noticeable V-shaped notch below the tail which facilitates passing the eggs. Upon completion of the incubation period, a fully formed hatchling uses an egg tooth to break out of its shell. It digs to the surface of the nest and begins a life of survival on its own. They are hatched with an embryonic egg sac which serves as a source of nutrition for the first three to seven days until they have the strength and mobility to find food. Juvenile tortoises often require a different balance of nutrients than adults, so may eat foods which a more mature tortoise would not. For example, the young of a strictly herbivorous species commonly will consume worms or insect larvae for additional protein.\\r\\nThe number of concentric rings on the carapace, much like the cross-section of a tree, can sometimes give a clue to how old the animal is, but, since the growth depends highly on the accessibility of food and water, a tortoise that has access to plenty of forage (or is regularly fed by its owner) with no seasonal variation will have no noticeable rings. Moreover, some tortoises grow more than one ring per season, and in some others, due to wear, some rings are no longer visible.[11]\\r\\nTortoises generally have one of the longest lifespans of any animal, and some individuals are known to have lived longer than 150 years.[12] Because of this, they symbolize longevity in some cultures, such as China. The oldest tortoise ever recorded, and one of the oldest individual animals ever recorded, was Tu'i Malila, which was presented to the Tongan royal family by the British explorer Captain Cook shortly after its birth in 1777. Tu'i Malila remained in the care of the Tongan royal family until its death by natural causes on May 19, 1965, at the age of 188.[13] The record for the longest-lived vertebrate is exceeded only by one other, a koi named Hanako whose death on July 17, 1977, ended a 226-year lifespan.[14]\\r\\nThe Alipore Zoo in India was the home to Adwaita, which zoo officials claimed was the oldest living animal until its death on March 23, 2006. Adwaita (sometimes spelled with two ds) was an Aldabra giant tortoise brought to India by Lord Wellesley, who handed it over to the Alipur Zoological Gardens in 1875 when the zoo was set up. West Bengal officials said records showed Adwaita was at least 150 years old, but other evidence pointed to 250. Adwaita was said to be the pet of Robert Clive.[15]\\r\\nHarriet was a resident at the Australia Zoo in Queensland from 1887 to her death in 2006; she was believed to have been brought to England by Charles Darwin aboard the Beagle and then on to Australia by John Clements Wickham.[16] Harriet died on June 23, 2006, just shy of her 176th birthday.\\r\\nTimothy, a spur-thighed tortoise, lived to be about 165 years old. For 38 years, she was carried as a mascot aboard various ships in Britain's Royal Navy. Then in 1892, at age 53, she retired to the grounds of Powderham Castle in Devon. Up to the time of her death in 2004, she was believed to be the United Kingdom's oldest resident.\\r\\nJonathan, a Seychelles giant tortoise living on the island of St Helena, may be as old as 182[17][18] or 178 years.[19]\\r\\nMany species of tortoises are sexually dimorphic, though the differences between males and females vary from species to species.[20] In some species, males have a longer, more protruding neck plate than their female counterparts, while in others, the claws are longer on the females.\\r\\nIn most tortoise species, the female tends to be larger than the male. The male plastron is curved inwards to aid reproduction. The easiest way to determine the sex of a tortoise is to look at the tail. The females, as a general rule, have smaller tails, dropped down, whereas the males have much longer tails which are usually pulled up and to the side of the rear shell.\\r\\nThe brain of a tortoise is extremely small. The tortoises, from Central and South America, do not have an area in the brain called the hippocampus, which relates to emotion, learning, memory and spatial navigation. Studies have shown that red-footed tortoises may rely on an area of the brain called the medial cortex, an area that humans use for actions such as decision making.[21]\\r\\nIn the 17th century, Francesco Redi performed an experiment that involved removing the brain of a land tortoise, which then proceeded to live six months.[citation needed] Freshwater tortoises, when subjected to the same experiment, continued similarly, but did not live so long. Redi also cut the head off a tortoise entirely, and it lived for 23 days.[22][23][24]\\r\\nGiant tortoises move very slowly on dry land, at only 0.17?mph (0.27?km/h).[25] The fastest recorded tortoise speed is 5?mph (8.0?km/h).[26]\\r\\nThe tortoise starts digging the ground to form its hybernaculum at the first signs of autumn. It digs with its fore-feet in a very slow motion, and prefers swampy grounds where it could bury itself in mud. It starts losing its appetite for food as the temperature drops until it stops eating. During hibernation it stops breathing as well. When the weather warms up suddenly it stops its digging, and starts it again as soon as the temperature drops. It wakes up from hibernation in the spring, but it does not start eating immediately. Gradually it gains its appetite and energy as the temperature warms up. During hot summer days, tortoises eat voraciously, and spend many hours sleeping. They start sleeping in late afternoon until late the next morning. Although tortoises love warm weather, they avoid hot sun, hiding under green leaves or between vegetation.[27]\\r\\nMost land-based tortoises are herbivores, feeding on grasses, weeds, leafy greens, flowers, and some fruits, although some omnivorous species are in this family. Pet tortoises typically require diets based on wild grasses, weeds, leafy greens and certain flowers. Certain species consume worms or insects and carrion in their normal habitats. Too much protein is detrimental in herbivorous species, and has been associated with shell deformities and other medical problems. As different tortoise species vary greatly in their nutritional requirements, it is essential to thoroughly research the dietary needs of individual tortoises.\\r\\nThis species list largely follows van Dijk et al. (2014)[28] and Rhodin et al. (2015).[29]\\r\\nFamily Testudinidae Batsch 1788[30]\\r\\nIn Hinduism, Kurma (Sanskrit: ?????) was the second Avatar of Vishnu.

It took place in Uruguay from 13 to 30 July 1930. FIFA, football's international governing body, selected Uruguay as host nation, as the country would be celebrating the centenary of its first constitution, and the Uruguay national football team had successfully retained their football title at the 1928 Summer Olympics. All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, the majority at the Estadio Centenario, which was built for the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirteen teams (seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America) entered the tournament. Only a few European teams chose to participate because of the difficulty of travelling to South America. The teams were divided into four groups, with the winner of each group progressing to the semi-finals. The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by France and the United States, who defeated Mexico 4ÿ1 and Belgium 3ÿ0, respectively. Lucien Laurent of France scored the first goal in World Cup history, while US goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas posted the first official \\"clean sheet\\" in the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nArgentina, Uruguay, the United States and Yugoslavia each won their respective groups to qualify for the semi-finals. In the final, hosts and pre-tournament favourites Uruguay defeated Argentina 4ÿ2 in front of a crowd of 68,346?people, and became the first nation to win the World Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, Hungary and Uruguay all lodged applications to host the event.[2][3] Uruguay's bid became the clear selection after all the other countries withdrew their bids.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first World Cup was the only one without qualification. Every country affiliated with FIFA was invited to compete, and given a deadline of 28 February 1930 to accept. Plenty of interest was shown by nations in the Americas; Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and the United States all entered. A total of seven South American teams participated, more than in any subsequent World Cup Finals. However, because of the long and costly trip by ship across the Atlantic Ocean, and the length of absence required for players,[2] very few European teams were inclined to take part. Some refused to countenance travel to South America in any circumstances,[4] and no European entries were received before the February deadline. In an attempt to gain some European participation, the Uruguayan Football Association sent a letter of invitation to The Football Association, even though the British Home Nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) had resigned from FIFA at the time. This was rejected by the FA Committee on 18 November 1929.[5] Two months before the start of the tournament, no team from Europe had officially entered.[6]\\r\\nFIFA president Jules Rimet intervened, and eventually four European teams made the trip by sea: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Romanians, managed by Constantin R?dulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following the intervention of newly crowned King Carol?II. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers to ensure that the players would still have jobs upon their return.[7] The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could be persuaded to make the trip.[8] The Belgians participated at the instigation of German-Belgian FIFA vice-president Rodolphe Seeldrayers.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nLucien Laurent[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Romanians boarded the SS Conte Verde at Genoa, the French were picked up at Villefranche-sur-Mer on 21 June 1930;[11] and the Belgians embarked at Barcelona.[12] The Conte Verde carried Rimet, the trophy and the three designated European referees: the Belgians Jean Langenus and Henri Christophe, along with Thomas Balway, a Parisian who may have been English. The Brazilian team were picked up when the boat docked in Rio de Janeiro on 29 June before arriving in Uruguay on 4 July.[6] Yugoslavia travelled via the mail steamship Florida from Marseille.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Kingdom of Yugoslavia there were doubts about their participation at first. Since the Croatians decided to boycott the national team, King Alexander I did not want to finance the whole idea, but in the end they found a solution. Belgrade football association officials decided to round up only domestic (Serbian) star players, mainly from two rival Belgrade clubs, BSK and SK Jugoslavija, with an additional three Serbs who played for French clubs (Ivan Bek among them). \\r\\nTherefore, the Yugoslavia team was exclusively made up of Serbian players; and with the two biggest stars of the team, Blagoje Marjanovi? (\\"Mo?a\\") and Aleksandar Tirnani? (\\"Tirke\\"), both from BSK, they were ready for a trip to South America to represent Yugoslavia in the World Cup. The Yugoslavians were the youngest team in the World Cup; with an average age of 21 years and 258 days. After their first match, against Brazil, they received a new nickname \\"The Ich-es\\" or \\"Ichachos\\" (in Spanish) by the Uruguayan press; referring to most of the player's surnames that ended up with the \\"-i?\\" or \\"-vi?\\" suffix, which is quite common for Serbian last names. They achieved the jointÿbiggest success in both Yugoslav and Serbian subsequent World Cup footballing history, by earning fourth place, a result that would be repeated in 1962.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll matches took place in Montevideo. Three stadiums were used: Estadio Centenario, Estadio Pocitos, and Estadio Parque Central. The Estadio Centenario was built both for the tournament and as a celebration of the centenary of Uruguayan independence. Designed by Juan Scasso,[14] it was the primary stadium for the tournament, referred to by Rimet as a \\"temple of football\\".[15] With a capacity of 90,000, it was the largest football stadium outside the British Isles.[9] The stadium hosted 10 of the 18?matches, including both semi-finals and the final. However, a rushed construction schedule and delays caused by the rainy season meant the Centenario was not ready for use until five days into the tournament.[16] Early matches were played at smaller stadiums usually used by Montevideo football clubs Nacional and Pe?arol, the 20,000 capacity Parque Central and the Pocitos.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a list of all squads that appeared in the final tournament, see 1930 FIFA World Cup squads.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifteen referees participated in the tournament: four Europeans ÿ two Belgians (Henri Christophe and John Langenus), a Frenchman, and a Romanian (Constantin R?dulescu, also the Romanian team coach),[17] and eleven from the Americas ÿ among them six Uruguayans. In order to eliminate differences in the application of the Laws of the Game, the referees were invited to one short meeting to iron out the most conflicting issues arising from the game.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the refereeing appointments, the two that attracted most attention were that of Gilberto de Almeida Rgo in the match between Argentina and France, in which the Brazilian referee blew for full-time six minutes early, and that of the Bolivian Ulises Saucedo's in the Argentina and Mexico encounter, which Argentina won 6ÿ3. During the game Saucedo, who was also the coach of Bolivia,[17] awarded three penalties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is the list of officials to serve as referees and linesmen. Officials in italics were only employed as linesmen during the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 13 teams were drawn into four groups, with Group 1 containing four teams, and the others containing  three. Each group played a round-robin format, with the four group winners progressing to the knockout semi-final stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nUruguay, Argentina, Brazil, and the United States were seeded, and were kept apart in the draw,[19] which took place in Montevideo once all the teams arrived.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince there were no qualifying games, the opening two matches of the tournament were the first World Cup games ever played, taking place simultaneously on 13 July 1930; France beat Mexico 4ÿ1 at the Estadio Pocitos, while the United States defeated Belgium 3ÿ0 at the same time at the Estadio Gran Parque Central. France's Lucien Laurent was the scorer of the first World Cup goal.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nLucien Laurent[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first group was the only one to contain four teams: Argentina, Chile, France and Mexico. Two days after France's victory over Mexico, they faced group favourites Argentina. Injuries hindered France; goalkeeper Alex Thpot had to leave the field after 20?minutes, and Laurent, after a fierce tackle by Luis Monti, spent most of the match limping. However, they held out for most of the match, only succumbing to an 81st-minute goal scored from a Monti free kick.[22] The game featured an officiating controversy when referee Almeida Rgo erroneously blew the final whistle six minutes early, with Frenchman Marcel Langiller clear on goal; play only resumed after protests from the French players.[23] Though France had played twice in 48 hours, Chile had yet to play their first match. They faced Mexico the following day, gaining a comfortable 3ÿ0 win.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance's final match, against Chile, featured the first penalty kick of the World Cup . The first goalkeeper to save a penalty was Alex Thpot of France on 19 July 1930, saving from Chile's Carlos Vidal in the 30th minute of the match.[25] In Argentina's second match, against Mexico, three penalty kicks were awarded. During the same match on 19 July 1930 Mexico's Oscar Bonfiglio Martnez saved another penalty at the 23rd minute of the match against Argentina's Fernando Paternoster.[25] Guillermo Stbile scored a hat-trick in his international debut[26] as Argentina won 6ÿ3, despite the absence of their captain Manuel Ferreira, who had returned to Buenos Aires to take a law exam.[27] Qualification was decided by the group's final match, contested by Argentina and Chile, who had beaten France and Mexico, respectively. The game was marred by a brawl sparked by a foul on Arturo Torres by Monti.[23] Argentina won 3ÿ1 against their neighbours and advanced to the semi-finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second group contained Brazil, Bolivia and Yugoslavia. Brazil, the group seeds, were expected to progress, but in the group's opening match, unexpectedly lost 2ÿ1 to Yugoslavia.[28] Going into the tournament Bolivia had never previously won an international match. For their opener they paid tribute to the hosts by wearing shirts each emblazoned with a single letter, spelling \\"Viva Uruguay\\" as the team lined up.[29] Both of Bolivia's matches followed a similar pattern, a promising start gradually transforming into heavy defeat. Against Yugoslavia, they held out for an hour before conceding, but were four goals down by the final whistle.[24] Misfortune played its part; several Bolivian goals were disallowed.[29] Against Brazil, when both teams had only pride to play for, the score was 1ÿ0 to Brazil at half-time. Brazil added three more in the second half, two of them scored by the multi-sportsman Preguinho.[30] Yugoslavia qualified for the semi-finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nHosts Uruguay were in a group with Peru and Romania. The opening match in this group saw the first player expulsion in the competition, when Plcido Galindo of Peru was dismissed against Romania. The Romanians made their man advantage pay; their 3ÿ1 win included two late goals. This match had the smallest crowd of any in World Cup history. The official attendance was 2,459, but the actual figure is generally accepted to be around 300.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of construction delays at Estadio Centenario, Uruguay's first match was not played until five days into the tournament. The first to be held at the Centenario, it was preceded by a ceremony in honour of the Uruguayan centenary celebrations. The Uruguayan team spent the four weeks preceding the match in a training camp, at which strict discipline was exercised. Goalkeeper Andrs Mazali was dropped from the squad for breaking a curfew to visit his wife.[32] One hundred years to the day of the creation of Uruguay's first constitution, the hosts won a tight match against Peru 1ÿ0.[33] Spectators praised Peru's defense, and this turned out to be the only tournament match in which Uruguay scored only one goal.[34] The result was viewed as a poor performance by the Uruguayan press, but lauded in Peru.[33] Uruguay subsequently defeated Romania with ease, scoring four first half goals to win 4ÿ0.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth group contained Belgium, Paraguay and The United States. The American team, which contained a significant number of new caps, were reputedly nicknamed \\"the shot-putters\\" by an unnamed source in the French contingent.[3] They beat their first opponents, Belgium, 3ÿ0. The ease of the victory was unexpected; Uruguayan newspaper Imparcial wrote that \\"the large score of the American victory has really surprised the experts\\".[35] Belgian reports bemoaned the state of the pitch and refereeing decisions, claiming that the second goal was offside.[35] The group's second match, played in windy conditions,[36] witnessed the first tournament hat-trick, scored by Bert Patenaude of the United States against Paraguay. Until 10 November 2006, the first hat-trick that FIFA acknowledged had been scored by Guillermo Stbile of Argentina, two days after Patenaude; however, in 2006 FIFA announced that Patenaude's claim to being the first hat-trick scorer was valid, as a goal previously assigned to teammate Tom Florie was reattributed to Patenaude.[37][38] With the United States having secured qualification, the final match in the group was a dead rubber. Paraguay beat Belgium by a 1ÿ0 margin.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four group winners, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Uruguay and the United States, moved to the semi-finals. The two semi-final matches saw identical scores. The first semi-final was played between the USA and Argentina on a rain-drenched pitch. The United States team, which featured six British-born players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after ten minutes to a broken leg as the match became violent.[39] A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1ÿ0 half-time lead. In the second half, the strength of the United States team was overwhelmed by the pace of the Argentinian attacks, the match finishing 6ÿ1 to Argentina.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second semi-final there were shades of the 1924 Summer Olympics match between Yugoslavia and Uruguay. Here, though, Yugoslavia took a surprise lead through Vujadinovi?. Uruguay then took a 2ÿ1 lead. Then shortly before half-time Yugoslavia had a goal disallowed by a controversial offside decision.[28] The hosts scored three more in the second half to win 6ÿ1, Pedro Cea completing a hat-trick.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe now-traditional third place play-off was not established until 1934, so the format of the 1930 World Cup is unique in not distinguishing between the third and fourth placed teams. Occasional sources, notably a FIFA Bulletin from 1984, incorrectly imply that a third-place match occurred and was won 3ÿ1 by Yugoslavia.[41] Accounts differ as to whether a third-place match was originally scheduled. According to a 2009 book by Hyder Jawad, Yugoslavia refused to play a third-place match because they were upset with the refereeing in their semi-final against Uruguay.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the championship, the captains of the United States team (Tom Florie)[43] and Yugoslavia (Milutin Ivkovi?)[44] both received bronze medals. Yet a FIFA technical committee report on the 1986 World Cup included full retrospective rankings of all teams at all previous World Cup finals; this report ranked the United States third and Yugoslavia fourth, due to a better goal difference on otherwise identical records,[45] a practice since continued by FIFA.[46] In 2010, the son of Kosta Had?i, the chief of Yugoslav delegation at the 1930 World Cup and the vice-president of the Football Association of Yugoslavia at the time, claimed that Yugoslavia, as a team, has been awarded one bronze medal, which has been kept by Had?i himself and his family for the following 80 years. According to this source, Yugoslavia was placed third because of the semi-finals loss to the eventual champions, Uruguay.[47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resounding wins for Uruguay and Argentina in the semi-finals meant the final was a repeat of the matchup in the 1928 Olympic final, which Uruguay had won 2ÿ1 after a replay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final was played at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine supporters crossed the river with the war cry Victoria o muerte (\\"victory or death\\"), dispelling any uncertainty as to whether the tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate,[28] and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10ÿ15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before kick-off, let alone reach the stadium.[49] At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons.[50] The gates were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full,[28] the official attendance 93,000.[51] A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second.[3] Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness.[40] Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats on the eve of the match. The referee was Belgian John Langenus, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety.[52] One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hosts scored the opening goal through Pablo Dorado, a low shot from a position on the right.[54] Argentina, displaying superior passing ability, responded strongly. Within eight minutes they were back on level terms; Carlos Peucelle received a Ferreira through-ball, beat his marker and equalised.[54] Shortly before half-time leading tournament goalscorer Guillermo Stbile gave Argentina a 2ÿ1 lead. Uruguay captain Nasazzi protested, maintaining that Stbile was offside, but to no avail.[52] In the second half Uruguay gradually became ascendant. Shortly after Monti missed a chance to make the score 3ÿ1, Uruguay attacked in numbers, and Pedro Cea scored an equaliser.[54] Ten minutes later a goal by Santos Iriarte gave Uruguay the lead, and just before full-time Castro made it 4ÿ2 to seal the win.[52] Langenus ended the match a minute later, and Uruguay thus added the title World Cup winners to their mantle of Olympic champions. Jules Rimet presented the World Cup Trophy, which was later named for him, to the head of the Uruguayan Football Association, Ra~l Jude.[55] The following day was declared a national holiday in Uruguay;[51] in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, a mob threw stones at the Uruguayan consulate.[56] Francisco Varallo (who played as a forward for Argentina) was the last player of the final to die, on 30 August 2010.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance, Yugoslavia and the United States all played friendlies in South America following the competition. Brazil played France on 1 August, Yugoslavia on 10 August and the United States on 17 August,[58] while Argentina hosted Yugoslavia on 3 August.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nUruguay's aggregate goal difference of +12 over four games, at an average of +3 per match, remains the highest average goal difference per match of any World Cup champion, and the second highest of any World Cup Finals participant, after Hungary in 1954.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith eight goals, Guillermo Stbile was the top scorer in the tournament. In total, 70 goals were scored by 36 players, with only one of them credited as an own goal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1986, FIFA published a report that ranked all teams in each World Cup up to and including 1986, based on progress in the competition, overall results and quality of the opposition.[45][13] The rankings for the 1930 tournament were as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last surviving player from Uruguay's World Cup-winning side was Ernesto Mascheroni, who died on 3 July 1984 at the age of 76. He was outlived by reserve defender Emilio Recoba who died on 12 September 1992 (aged 87), but did not play any matches in the tournament. However, many other players who participated in the tournament were still alive by this stage and the last surviving player from the tournament was Argentina's Francisco Varallo, who died on 30 August 2010 at the age of 100 ÿ eighty years after the tournament.[69] Lucien Laurent, the scorer of the first ever World Cup Goal was the last surviving Member of the France Squad and was invited in 1998 Final seeing France lifting its first ever World Cup win also as the only France member. He died in 2005 at the age of 97.\\r\\n\\r\\nA recreation of the tournament from the point of view of the Yugoslavian team can be seen in the 2014 Serbian film See You in Montevideo.","input":"Who won the first foot ball world cup?"},{"output":"Arthur Fleming","context":"Arthur Fleming Fazzin (May 1, 1924 ÿ April 25, 1995) was an American actor and television host. He is most notable for being the original host of the television game show Jeopardy!,[1] which aired on NBC from 1964 until 1975.\\r\\n\\r\\nFleming was born in New York City.[citation needed] His parents, William and Marie Fazzin, had immigrated to the United States from Austria. They were a popular dance team in Europe, who had brought their show to America. Their son Art was a varsity letterman football player at James Monroe High School in New York City,[2] standing 6 foot, 4?inches (1.93?m), weighing 220 pounds (100?kg). He later attended Colgate and Cornell universities,[3] starring on the football team, as well as water polo teams at both colleges. Fleming was a World War II veteran who served in the U.S. Navy for three and a half years as the pilot of a patrol bomber in the Atlantic.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter leaving the Navy, Fleming became an announcer at a radio station in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Here, he first shortened his name to \\"Art Fleming\\". His radio career later took him to Akron, Ohio, and back home to New York. He was the first announcer to deliver the slogan \\"Winston tastes good, like a cigarette should\\" for Winston cigarettes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFleming's acting career began at age four, when he starred in a Broadway play. His first television role was as a stunt double for Ralph Bellamy in the detective series Man Against Crime. In 1959 he starred as detective Ken Franklin in the ABC TV series International Detective, credited as Arthur Fleming. He also played attorney Jeremy Pitt in The Californians, an NBC Western set in San Francisco during the gold rush of the 1850s.\\r\\nFleming also appeared in many television commercials. He was first spotted by Merv Griffin on a commercial for Trans World Airlines. Griffin thought Fleming was \\"authoritative, yet warm and interesting\\", and Fleming was invited to audition for the role of host for a quiz show Griffin was developing. Fleming (an actor with no prior TV quiz show experience) was initially skeptical, but his agent encouraged him to \\"act like a game show host\\" at his audition, and Fleming ultimately won the job.[1] The show was Jeopardy!, which Fleming hosted from March 30, 1964, to January 3, 1975,[4] and again from October 2, 1978, to March 2, 1979. Although often described as the \\"host\\" of the program, announcer Don Pardo's introduction of him announced, \\"and here's the star of Jeopardy!, Art Fleming.\\" As  \\"the world's greatest quiz show's\\" first host, Fleming earned two Emmy Award nominations. While he was host of Jeopardy!, Fleming never missed a taping.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause he hosted a quiz show, Fleming earned a reputation as being a storehouse of trivia. While appearing as a guest star on Hollywood Squares (another NBC game show in the 1960s and 1970s), Fleming was once selected as the \\"secret square\\". His question was, \\"In 1938, who won the Wimbledon women's tennis championship?\\" Fleming picked Helen Wills Moody, one of the three choices read to him. The female contestant (who had selected Fleming) turned to Hollywood Squares MC Peter Marshall, saying, \\"Art Fleming would never lie! I agree!\\" He was right, and the contestant won $11,000. Fleming later said he did not know a thing about tennis and had guessed the answer. He hoped the contestant would disagree, thinking he was wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout his career, Fleming starred in about 5,000 episodes of television programs and 48 motion pictures. After Jeopardy!'s first cancellation in 1975, Fleming returned to acting. In 1977 he played the role of W. Averell Harriman in the movie MacArthur starring Gregory Peck, and appeared in the comedy film American Raspberry, and also appeared in episodes of Starsky and Hutch, Kingston: Confidential, and the 1976 TV miniseries The Moneychangers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFleming also hosted a radio version of College Bowl for CBS Radio from 1979 to 1982. He hosted the NBC radio weekend magazine Monitor during 1972. Fleming reprised his role as host of Jeopardy! in the 1982 movie Airplane II: The Sequel and in \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic's music video \\"I Lost on Jeopardy\\". Fleming was also often called upon to host mock versions of Jeopardy! at trade shows and conventions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was reported that Fleming was asked to reprise his role as Jeopardy! host when Merv Griffin began developing a revival of the show in 1983. He declined, later stating in 1989 that he did not like the direction the show had gone in moving the show to Hollywood (being partial to his native New York, he felt that the Hollywood setting made the show dumber and less realistic).[5] As a result, Alex Trebek took the position instead and has hosted the program ever since.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1980 to 1992, Fleming hosted a daily radio talk show on KMOX in St. Louis, which continued until his retirement. On Sunday evenings, he occasionally co-hosted Trivia Spectacular with David Strauss, a St. Louis schoolteacher. He also hosted the syndicated radio program When Radio Was.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Fleming was first married to actress Peggy Ann Ellis, who worked on The Merv Griffin Show. They had a daughter, Jan Marie Hanna[6] and were divorced after five years. Fleming then married Becky Lynn in a private ceremony at Norman Vincent Peale's home. He soon adopted Beckys two children from a prior marriage. Together they had five grandchildren. In 1992, Fleming retired and the family moved to Crystal River, Florida. He remained active in charity work: he hosted fundraising videos for the Citrus County United Way and became involved with the Citrus County Abuse Shelter Association, Inc. (where Becky served as director). He also hosted a syndicated television program, called Senior America, which showcased seniors and senior activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nFleming died of pancreatic cancer at his home on April 25, 1995, six days before his 71st birthday. His ashes were scattered at sea.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nStudio 25 of The Burbank Studios is named in his honor.[citation needed]","input":"Who was the first host of the show jeopardy?"},{"output":"a federation of 13 states","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment of Malaysia officially the Federal Government of Malaysia (Malay: Kerajaan Persekutuan Malaysia)  based in the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and the federal executive based in Putrajaya. Malaysia is a federation of 13 states operating within a constitutional monarchy under the Westminster parliamentary system and is categorised as a representative democracy. The federal government of Malaysia adheres to and is created by the Federal Constitution of Malaysia, the supreme law of the land.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe federal government adopts the principle of separation of powers under Article 127 of the Federal Constitution,[2] and has three branches: executive, legislature and judiciary.[3] The state governments in Malaysia also have their respective executive and legislative bodies. The judicial system in Malaysia is a federalised court system operating uniformly throughout the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe federal or central government is the ultimate authority in Malaysia having its base in Putrajaya. It is headed by the Prime Minister of Malaysia who is also known as the head of government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bicameral parliament consists of the lower house, the House of Representatives or Dewan Rakyat (literally the \\"Chamber of the People\\") and the upper house, the Senate or Dewan Negara (literally the \\"Chamber of the Nation\\").[4][5][5] All seventy Senate members sit for three-year terms (to a maximum of two terms); twenty-six are elected by the thirteen state assemblies, and forty-four are appointed by the king based on the advice of the Prime Minister.[6] The 222 members of the Dewan Rakyat are elected from single-member districts by universal adult suffrage. The parliament follows a multi-party system and the governing body is elected through a first-past-the-post system. Parliament has a maximum mandate of five years by law. The king may dissolve parliament at any time and usually does so upon the advice of the Prime Minister.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Monarch remains the Head of State real executive power is vested in the cabinet led by the prime minister as Head of Government; the Malaysian constitution stipulates that the prime minister must be a member of the Lower House of parliament who, in the opinion of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (YDPA), commands a majority in parliament.[7] The cabinet is chosen from among members of both houses of Parliament and is responsible to that body.[8]\\r\\nThe Executive branch of the government consists of the Prime Minister as the head of the government, followed by the various ministers of the Cabinet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest court in the judicial system is the Federal Court, followed by the Court of Appeal, and two High Courts, one for Peninsular Malaysia, and one for East Malaysia. The subordinate courts in each of these jurisdictions include Sessions Courts, Magistrates' Courts, and Courts for Children. Malaysia also has a Special Court to hear cases brought by or against all Royalty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prime Minister of Malaysia (Malay: Perdana Menteri Malaysia) is the indirectly elected head of government (executive) of Malaysia. He is officially appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the head of state, who in HM's judgment is likely to command the confidence of the majority of the members of that House of Representatives (Dewan Rakyat), the elected lower house of Parliament. He heads the Cabinet, whose members are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong advice of the prime minister. The Prime Minister and his Cabinet shall be collectively responsible to Parliament. The Prime Minister's Department (sometimes referred to as the Prime Minister's Office) is the body and ministry in which the Prime Minister exercises its functions and powers.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach state governments in Malaysia is created by the respective state constitutions. Each state has a unicameral state legislative chamber (Malay: Dewan Undangan Negeri) whose members are elected from single-member constituencies. State governments are led by Chief Ministers[6] (Menteri Besar in Malay states or Ketua Menteri in states without hereditary rulers), who are state assembly members from the majority party in the Dewan Undangan Negeri. They advise their respective sultans or governors. In each of the states with a hereditary ruler, the Chief Minister is required to be a Malay, appointed by the Sultan upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe local government or local authority (Malay: kerajaan tempatan or pihak berkuasa tempatan (PBT)) is the lowest level in the system of government in Malaysiaafter federal and state. It has the power to collect taxes (in the form of assessment tax), to create laws and rules (in the form of by-laws) and to grant licenses and permits for any trade in its area of jurisdiction, in addition to providing basic amenities, collecting and managing waste and garbage as well as planning and developing the area under its jurisdiction. Local authorities in Malaysia are generally under the exclusive purview of the state governments and headed by a civil servant with the title Yang Di-Pertua (President). Local government areas and the boundaries is usually consistent with district boundaries but there are some places where the boundaries are not consistent and may overlap with adjoining districts especially in urbanised areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike the federal and state governments, the local governments in Malaysia are not elected but appointed by the state government after local council elections were suspended by the federal government in 1965.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Malaysian Armed Forces are the military body of Malaysia and the Royal Malaysian Police are in charge of law enforcement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe law of Malaysia is mainly based on the common law legal system. This was a direct result of the colonisation of Malaya, Sarawak, and North Borneo by Britain between the early 19th century to 1960s. The supreme law of the landthe Constitution of Malaysiasets out the legal framework and rights of Malaysian citizens. Federal laws enacted by the Parliament of Malaysia apply throughout the country. There are also state laws enacted by the State Legislative Assemblies which applies in the particular state. The constitution of Malaysia also provides for a unique dual justice systemthe secular laws (criminal and civil) and sharia laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticles 73 to 79 of the Federal Constitution specifies the subject in which the federal and state government may legislate. Parliament has the exclusive power to make laws over matters falling under the Federal List (such as citizenship, defence, internal security, civil and criminal law, finance, trade, commerce and industry, education, labour, and tourism) whereas each State, through its Legislative Assembly, has legislative power over matters under the State List (such as land, local government, Syariah law and Syariah courts, State holidays and State public works). Parliament and State legislatures share the power to make laws over matters under the Concurrent List (such as water supplies and housing) but Article 75 provides that in the event of conflict, Federal law will prevail over State law.\\r\\n\\r\\nElections in Malaysia exist at two levels: national level and state level. National level elections are those for membership in the Dewan Rakyat, the lower house of Parliament, while state level elections are for membership in the various State Legislative Assemblies.

Eight teams from each of the two conferences qualify for the playoffs based on regular season points totals. The final round is commonly known as the Stanley Cup Finals, which sees the two conference champions play for the Stanley Cup.\\r\\nThe NHL has always used a playoff tournament to determine its champion. Its playoff system has changed over the years, from the league's inception in 1917 when ownership of the Stanley Cup was shared between different leagues, to when the NHL took over the Cup in 1926, to the current setup today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Stanley Cup playoffs consists of four rounds of best-of-seven series. Each series is played in a 2ÿ2ÿ1ÿ1ÿ1 format, meaning the team with home-ice advantage hosts games one, two, five, and seven, while their opponent hosts games three, four, and six. Games five, six, and seven are only played if needed.\\r\\nEight teams in each conference qualify for the playoffs. In the playoff series format instituted in 2014, the first, second, and third place team in each of the four divisions qualify for the playoffs automatically. Two additional teams from each conference, regardless of divisional alignment, also qualify for the playoffs by having the highest point totals out of the remaining teams in the conference. These teams are referred to as the Wild Cards. Since there is no attention paid to divisional alignment with the wild cards, it is possible for one division in each conference to have five teams in the postseason while the other has just three.\\r\\nIn the First Round,[1] the teams are split into two separate brackets by division. Each bracket consists of the top three divisional qualifiers and one of the wild cards. The lower seeded wild card plays against the division winner with the best record while the other wild card plays against the other division winner, and both wild cards are de facto #4 seeds. The other two series match the second and third place teams from the divisions.\\r\\nThe winners of both First Round series advance to the Second Round.[1] The reseeding in the previous format, which ensured the top seed would play the lowest remaining seed, was discarded. The winners of these series advance to the Conference Finals and the two Conference Final winners move on to the Stanley Cup Finals.[1]\\r\\nIn the first two rounds, the higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage (regardless of point record). Thereafter, it goes to the team with the better regular season record (regardless of seeding); in the case of a tie, the league's standard tiebreaking procedure is applied. The team with home-ice advantage hosts games one, two, five, and seven, while the opponent hosts games three, four, and six (games five through seven are played if necessary).\\r\\nAny ties in the standings at the end of the regular season are broken using the following protocols:\\r\\nThe National Hockey League has always used a playoff tournament to determine its champion, generally opening up its playoff games to a much larger number of teams, including those with a losing regular season record in some years (the most recent being the seventh and eighth seeded San Jose Sharks and Edmonton Oilers, respectively, in 1999).\\r\\nFrom the NHL's inception until 1920, both NHL and Pacific Coast Hockey Association teams were eligible for the Stanley Cup. The NHL's regular season was divided into two halves, with the top team from each half moving on to the league finals, which was a two-game total goals series in 1918 and a best-of-seven series in 1919. In 1920, the Ottawa Senators were automatically declared the league champion when the team had won both halves of the regular season. The two halves format was abandoned the next year, and the top two teams faced off for the NHL championship in a two-game total goals series.\\r\\nAt the time, the NHL champion would later face the winners of the PCHA and, from 1921, the Western Canada Hockey League in further rounds in order to determine the Stanley Cup champion. During this time, as the rules of the NHL and those of the western leagues differ (the main difference being that NHL rules allowed five skaters while the western leagues allowed six), the rules for each game in the Stanley Cup Finals alternated between those of the NHL and the western leagues. Before the WCHL competed for the Stanley Cup, the Cup championship series a best-of-five series. Following the involvement of the WCHL, one league champion was given a bye straight to the finals (a best-of-three affair starting in 1922), while the other two competed in a best-of-three semifinal. As travel expenses were high during these times, it was often the case that the NHL champions were sent west to compete. In a dispute between the leagues in 1923 about whether to send one or both western league champions east, the winner of the PCHA/WCHL series would proceed to the Stanley Cup Finals, while the loser of the series would face the NHL champion, both series being best-of-three.\\r\\nIn 1924 the NHL playoffs expanded from two to three teams (with the top team getting a bye to the two-game total goal NHL finals), but because the first-place Hamilton Tigers refused to play under this format, the second and third place teams played for the NHL championship in a two-game total goals affair. The Stanley Cup Finals returned to a best-of-five format the same year.[3]\\r\\nWith the merger of the PCHA and WCHL in 1925 and the merged league's collapse in 1926, the NHL took de facto control of the Stanley Cup. While the Cup would not be formally deeded to the league until 1947, from 1926 onward the NHL playoffs and the Stanley Cup playoffs are considered synonymous. The NHL was subsequently divided into the Canadian and American divisions until the 1927ÿ28 season. For 1927, six teams qualified for the playoffs, three from each division, with the division semifinals and finals being a two-game total goals affair, and the Stanley Cup Finals becoming a best-of-five series. In 1928, the playoff format was changed so that the two teams with identical division ranking would face each other (i.e. the first place teams played each other, the second place teams play each other, and likewise for the third place teams). The first place series was a best-of-five affair, with the winner proceeding to the best-of-three Stanley Cup Finals, while the others were a two-game total goals series. The winner of the second and third place series played each other in a best-of-three series, with the winner earning the other berth to the Stanley Cup Finals. This format had a slight modification the following year, where the semifinal series became a two-game total goals affair and the Stanley Cup Finals became a best-of-five series. The two-game total goals format was abolished in 1937, with those series being changed to best-of-three affairs.[4]\\r\\nThe 1930s saw the reduction of teams from ten to seven, and with it an end to the Canadian and American divisions. The Stanley Cup playoffs saw the first- and second-place teams play against each other in a best-of-seven series for one berth in the Stanley Cup Finals, while the third- to sixth-place teams battled in a series of best-of-three matches for the other berth (with the third-place team taking on the fourth-place team, and the fifth-place team against the sixth-place team). In 1939, the Stanley Cup Finals became a best-of-seven series, the format still used today.[4]\\r\\nThe 1942ÿ43 season saw the removal of the New York Americans, leaving six remaining teams (known today as the \\"Original Six\\"). Throughout this era, the first and third-place teams played in one best-of-seven semifinal, while the second and fourth-place teams played in the other best-of-seven semifinal. During this time, Detroit Red Wings fans often threw an octopus onto the ice as a good luck charm, as eight wins were required to win the Stanley Cup.[4]\\r\\nThe 1967 expansion saw the number of teams double from six to 12 in the 1967ÿ68 season, and with it the creation of the Western and Eastern divisions. The playoff format remained largely the same, with all series remaining best-of-seven, and the division champions battling for the Stanley Cup. The 1970ÿ71 season, because of fan demand, brought forth the first inter-conference playoff matchup outside of the Stanley Cup Finals since the pre-war expansion, which had the winner of the second-place versus fourth-place matchup in one conference take on the winner of the first- versus third-place matchup in the other conference for a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals. The following year had one minor change to its playoff format: a stronger team would face a weaker opponent. Thus, instead of a first-place versus third-place and a second versus fourth-place matchup in the first round, the first round had the first-place versus the fourth and the second versus the third-place. This practice of having stronger teams facing weaker opposition has continued to the present day.[4]\\r\\nThe 1974ÿ75 season saw another change to its playoff system to accommodate the league of 18 teams, 12 of which qualified for the playoffs. The top team from each division would earn a bye to the quarterfinal, while the second- and third-place teams from each division started their playoff run from a best-of-three preliminary round. In each round of the playoffs, the teams remaining were seeded regardless of divisional or conference alignment, with the preliminary-round series being a best-of-three affair while the remainder of the series remained best-of-seven. The 1977ÿ78 season had one minor change in its playoff format: although the second-place finishers from each division would qualify for the preliminary round, the four playoff spots reserved for the third-place teams were replaced by four wild-card spotsspots for the four teams with the highest regular-season point total that did not finish first or second in their divisions.[4]\\r\\nWith the absorption of four teams from the World Hockey Association in the 1979ÿ1980 season, a new playoff system was introduced where 16 of the league's 21 teams would qualify for postseason play. The four division winners would qualify for the playoffs while twelve wildcard positions rounded out the sixteen teams. At the beginning of each round the teams were seeded based on their regular season point totals, with the preliminary round being a best-of-five series while all other playoff series were best-of-seven.[4]\\r\\nThe 1981ÿ1982 season brought forth the return of divisional matchups, with the top four teams from each division qualifying for the playoffs. Division champions would be determined, followed by the Conference champions, who would meet in the Stanley Cup Finals. The division semifinals was a best-of-five affair until the 1986ÿ87 season, when it became a best-of-seven series, while all other series remained best-of seven.[4]\\r\\nFor the 1993ÿ94 season, the league revamped its playoff structure to become conference-based rather than division-based. Eight teams in each conference qualified for the playoffs. The division first-place teams were seeded first (the team with the best record in the conference) and second in the conference playoffs and received home ice advantage for the first two rounds. The next six best teams in each conference also qualified and were seeded third through eighth. All teams played in the first round: first-place versus eighth, second versus seventh, third versus sixth and fourth versus fifth. All series were best-of-seven, but the arrangement of home games was changed for Central and Pacific division teams. Instead of the normal 2ÿ2ÿ1ÿ1ÿ1 rotation, a series involving teams from both divisions was 2ÿ3ÿ2, with the higher seeded team having the option of starting play at home or on the road (ALL teams with home-ice advantage chose to play the default 2-2-1-1-1 format, from 1995-1998). After each round, surviving teams were reseeded to play a conference semi-final, then a conference final. The conference winners then played each other in the Stanley Cup Finals. Home ice advantage was determined by higher seed in the first three rounds and by regular-season points of the two teams in the Stanley Cup Finals.[4]\\r\\nIn 1998ÿ99, the league was re-organized into two conferences of three divisions apiece, resulting in the playoff format used through 2013. The qualifiers remained sixteen, but the seeding changed. The three first-place teams in each division qualified and were seeded first through third for the playoffs. Of the other teams in each conference, the top five finishers qualified for the fourth through eighth seedings. All teams played in the first round: first-place versus eighth, second versus seventh, third versus sixth and fourth versus fifth, by those criteria. After each round, surviving teams were reseeded to play a conference semi-final, then a conference final. Like the 1994ÿ1998 system, the conference winners then played each other in the Stanley Cup Finals, and home ice advantage was determined by higher seed in the first three rounds and by regular-season points of the two teams in the Stanley Cup Finals.[4]\\r\\nThe NHL realigned into a four-division, two-conference system for the 2013ÿ14 season. Under the new postseason system, the top three teams in each division make the playoffs, with two wild-cards in each conference (for a total of eight playoff teams from each conference). The format is division-based, similar to the 1981ÿ82 system. In the First Round, the top-ranked team in the conference plays against the lowest-ranked wild-card, while the other division winner plays against the higher ranked wild-card. The second and third place teams in each division then play each other. The first round winners then meet in the Second Round. The third round will still consist of the Western Conference and Eastern Conference Finals, with those conference winners advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals.[5]\\r\\nCompared to other major professional sports leagues, playoff upsets are relatively common in the NHL.[6] According to NHL broadcaster Darren Eliot, this is because the style of competition in the playoffs is different from the regular season: instead of playing different teams every night, the goal is to advance through four best-of-seven playoff series.[7] The Presidents' Trophy winner may have to go through other playoff clubs who might have a hotter goaltender, a better defensive team, or other players that pose matchup problems. If the regular season champion's primary success was only outscoring others, they may be out of luck facing goaltenders that can shut them out.[7] And although rare, another aspect is that the NHL leads the other leagues in game seven comebacks. Only four instances has an NHL team been able to come back from being down 0ÿ3 to win a seven-game series: the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs, the 1975 New York Islanders, the 2010 Philadelphia Flyers, and the 2014 Los Angeles Kings. There has been only one such \\"reverse sweep\\" comeback in the MLB postseason (the 2004 Boston Red Sox) and none in the NBA playoffs.\\r\\nNHL broadcaster Darren Eliot explaining the lack of success of Presidents' Trophy winners winning the Stanley Cup.[7]\\r\\nDespite having more American-based teams than Canadian-based ones throughout much of the NHL's existence (dating back to the Original Six era when it was two Canadian clubs to four American ones, and now 7 to 24 since 2017), there have been only two times in league history where none of the Canadian teams qualified for the postseason: 1970 and 2016.[8] However, the 1993 Montreal Canadiens remain the last Canadian club to go all the way and win the Stanley Cup.[9]\\r\\nThe Stanley Cup playoffs MVP award, the Conn Smythe Trophy is based on the entire NHL postseason instead of just the championship game or series, unlike the playoff MVP awards presented in the other major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada (the Super Bowl MVP, the NBA Finals MVP, and the World Series MVP), although in its history the trophy has never been given to someone that was not in the finals. Doug Gilmour and Peter Forsberg, in 1986 and 1999, respectively, are the only players who have topped the postseason in scoring without making it to the Finals.\\r\\nNHL players have often grown beards when their team is in the playoffs, where they do not shave until their team is eliminated or wins the Stanley Cup. The tradition was started in the 1980s by the New York Islanders, and is often mirrored by the fans, as well.[10][11]\\r\\nAt the conclusion of a playoff series, players and coaches line up and exchange handshakes with their counterparts on the opposing team, and this has been described by commentators as \\"one of the great traditions in sports\\".[12] However, there have been rare occasions that individual players have refused to participate, such as Gerry Cheevers who left the ice without shaking hands with any of the Flyers in 1978,[13] and Billy Smith who avoided handshakes as he was particularly passionate about losses.[14] More recent examples of players refusing the handshake include the 1996 playoffs when several Detroit Red Wings players protested the dirty hit by the Colorado Avalanche's Claude Lemieux,[15] and in the 2008 playoffs when Martin Brodeur refused to shake Sean Avery's hand after Avery screened him in an earlier game.[14]\\r\\nIt is common among players to never touch or hoist the Prince of Wales Trophy (Eastern Conference champion) or Clarence S. Campbell Bowl (Western Conference champion) after they have won the conference finals; the players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus it should be the only trophy that they should be hoisting. There have been six recent exceptions to this ÿ Scott Stevens of the Devils in 2000 and 2003; Sidney Crosby of the Penguins in 2009, 2016, and 2017; and Alex Ovechkin of the Capitals in 2018. In five of these occurrences, their teams went on to win the Stanley Cup. In recent years, the captain of the winning team poses (usually looking solemn) with the conference trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well.[16]\\r\\nThere are many traditions and anecdotes associated with the championship trophy, the Stanley Cup.\\r\\nBecause the Ice Hockey World Championships are held in the same time period as the Stanley Cup playoffs, the only NHL players who can participate in the former are those on NHL teams that have been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention.[17] This policy has been in place since a 1977 agreement between the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation, which allowed Team Canada to field a team in the World Championships after an-eight year absence.[18][19]\\r\\nCorrect as of 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs\\r\\nPrior to 1927 the NHL playoff champion did not receive the Stanley Cup. In most years the winning team was awarded the O'Brien Trophy but from 1915 through 1926 the NHA/NHL champion would play the PCHA/WHL champion for the Stanley Cup.[22] The results outlined here are only those between NHL teams and do not include any Stanley Cup Finals series before 1927. For the first four years the NHL playoffs entailed the best team from the first half of the season playing a two games against the best team from the second half. The winner was the team that scored the most combined goals. There were no NHL playoffs in 1920 because Ottawa had the best record in both halves and was declared the NHL champion. Starting in 1921 the NHL scrapped the half-season scheme and had the teams with the top two records play for the league title. In 1926 the league introduced a two-game semifinal series for the second- and third-best teams to play for entry into the final against the regular season champion. The following year, with 10 teams in the league, the NHL expanded the playoffs to include six teams. The winners of the Canadian and American divisions would earn byes into the semifinal round while the remaining four would start in the quarterfinals.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nThe playoff format was altered slightly in 1929, having the two division winners play one another in the semifinal rather than the winners of the quarterfinal round. Because the NHL took charge of the NHL finals became a best-of series as the Stanley cup championship had been since 1914. A year later the Semifinal round became a best-of series with the division winners playing a five game set and the quarterfinal winners facing off in a best-of-three meeting. In 1931 the meeting between quarterfinal winners reverted to a two-game total-goal series and didn't change back for five years. The next year all series became best-of's and two years after, in 1939, the league ended the divisional format when the Montreal Maroons suspended operations, leaving the league with only 7 teams. Instead, the top two finishers played one another in a best-of-seven semifinal round while the other four playoff teams played best-of-three series to decide the second finalist. The same year the Stanley Cup finals shifted to a best-of-seven series where it has remained ever since (as of 2018).\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nWith only six teams in the league the quarterfinal round was ended and the top four finishers made the playoffs. All playoff series became best-of-sevens with the #1 and #3 teams playing in one semifinal while the #2 and #4 seeds met in the other. This arrangement remained unchanged the entire 25-year duration of the 'Original Six' era.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nWhen the league doubled its size in 1967 they also doubled the number of playoff teams, reintroducing the quarterfinals but keeping the 1-vs-3 style that existed for the previous quarter-century and keeping all series as best-of-sevens. In 1971 the league altered the semifinals to pit east teams against west teams and followed that by rearranging the first round to have the top seeds play the bottom seeds in intra-conference series. Once they league's size swelled to 18 teams an additional four teams received bids into the postseason. Starting in 1975 the division winners received byes into the second round while the remaining eight teams started in a best-of-three preliminary round with the top seed facing the lowest seed. After the opening round all teams were reseeded for the quarterfinals and semifinals regardless of their division or conference.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nWhen the WHA folded in 1979 four teams were absorbed into the NHL. With 21 teams the NHL expanded the playoffs once more to include 16 with all teams starting in the preliminary round which was increased to a best-of-five series. Teams were seeded regardless of their conference or division 1 through 16 and reseeded after the first two rounds. Starting in 1982 the NHL split the playoffs into eastern- and western-conference with each conference providing 8 teams where it has remained since (as of 2018). Furthermore the NHL had the first two round being played within each division, granting the four regions one entry each into the conference finals. The divisional semifinals were expanded to seven-game-series in 1987.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nThe NHL added nine franchises from 1991 to 2000 while an additional four moving to new cities (three of those teams were WHA alumni) Despite the increase in league size the NHL playoffs remained static at 16 teams. The league did, however, change the format by dropping the divisional rounds in 1994 with the division winners receiving the top two seeds and the rest being sorted according to their records.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nAfter the NHL lockout in 2004-05 that saw the cancellation of the first Stanley Cup final in 86 years The league went through another stable period where no new franchises were added. The playoffs as well were mostly consistent throughout the period.

The Parliament is composed of the President of India and the houses. It is a bicameral legislature with two houses: the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and the Lok Sabha (House of the People). The President in his role as head of legislature has full powers to summon and prorogue either house of Parliament or to dissolve Lok Sabha. The president can exercise these powers only upon the advice of the Prime Minister and his Union Council of Ministers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose elected or nominated (by the President) to either house of Parliament are referred to as Members of Parliament (MP). The Members of Parliament, Lok Sabha are directly elected by the Indian public voting in Single-member districts and the Members of Parliament, Rajya Sabha are elected by the members of all State Legislative Assembly by proportional representation. The Parliament has a sanctioned strength of 545 in Lok Sabha including the 2 nominees from the Anglo-Indian Community by the President, and 245 in Rajya Sabha including the 12 nominees from the expertise of different fields of science, culture, art and history. The Parliament meets at Sansad Bhavan in New Delhi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sansad Bhavan (Parliament House) is located in New Delhi. It was designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, who were responsible for planning and construction of New Delhi by British government. The construction of buildings took six years and the opening ceremony was performed on 18 January 1927 by the then Viceroy and Governor-General of India, Irwin. The construction costs for the building were ?8.3 million (US$120,000). The parliament is 560 feet (170?m) in diameter and covers an area of 6 acres (2.4?ha). The Central hall consists of the chambers of Lok sabha, Rajya Sabha and the Library hall. Surrounding these three chambers is the four storied circular structure providing accommodations for members and houses Parliamentary committees, offices and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe centre and the focus of the building is the Central Hall. It consists of chambers of the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha and the Library Hall and between them lie garden courts. Surrounding these three chambers is the four storyed circular structure providing accommodations for Ministers, Chairmen, Parliamentary committees, Party offices, important offices of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Secretariats and also the offices of the ministry of Parliamentary affairs. The Central Hall is circular in shape and the dome is 29.87 m (98 feet) in diameter. It is a place of historical importance. The Indian Constitution was framed in the Central Hall. The Central Hall was originally used in the library of erstwhile Central Legislative Assembly and the Council of States. In 1946, it was converted and refurbished into Constituent Assembly Hall. At present, the Central Hall is used for holding joint sittings of both the houses of parliament and also used for address by the President in the commencement of first session after each general election.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new Parliament building may replace the existing complex. The new building is being considered on account of the stability concerns regarding the current complex.[9] A committee to suggest alternatives to the current building has been set up by the Former Speaker, Meira Kumar. The present building, an 85-year-old structure suffers from inadequacy of space to house members and their staff and is thought to suffer from structural issues. The building also needs to be protected because of its heritage tag.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian Parliament consists of two houses called the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha with the President of India acting as their head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President of India, the Head of state is a component of Parliament. Under Article 60 and Article 111, President's responsibility is to scrutinise that bills/laws passed by the parliament are in accordance with constitutional mandate and stipulated procedure is followed before according his/her approval to the bills. The President of India is elected by the elected members of Parliament of India and the state legislatures and serves for a term of 5 years.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nLok Sabha (House of the People) or the lower house has 545 members. 543 members are directly elected by citizens of India on the basis of universal adult franchise representing Parliamentary constituencies across the country and 2 members are appointed by the President of India from the Anglo-Indian Community. Every citizen of India who is over 18 years of age, irrespective of gender, caste, religion or race, who is otherwise not disqualified, is eligible to vote for the Lok Sabha. The Constitution provides that the maximum strength of the House be 552 members. It has a term of five years. To be eligible for membership in the Lok Sabha, a person must be a citizen of India and must be 25 years of age or older, mentally sound, should not be bankrupt and should not be criminally convicted. The total elective membership is distributed among the States in such a way that the ratio between the number of seats allotted to each State and the population of the State is, so far as practicable, the same for all States.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nRajya Sabha (Council of States) or the upper house is a permanent body not subject to dissolution. One third of the members retire every second year, and are replaced by newly elected members. Each member is elected for a term of six years.[13] Its members are indirectly elected by members of legislative bodies of the states. The Rajya Sabha can have a maximum of 250 members. It currently has a sanctioned strength of 245 members, of which 233 are elected from States and Union Territories and 12 are nominated by the President. The number of members from a state depends on its population. The minimum age for a person to become a member of Rajya Sabha is 30 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period during which the House meets to conduct its business is called a session. The Constitution empowers the president to summon each House at such intervals that there should not be more than a six-month gap between the two sessions. Hence the Parliament must meet at least twice a year. In India, the parliament conducts three sessions each year:[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nLegislative proposals are brought before either house of the Parliament in the form of a bill. A bill is the draft of a legislative proposal, which, when passed by both houses of Parliament and assented to by the President, becomes an Act of Parliament. Money bills must originate in the Lok Sabha. The council of states can only make recommendations over the bills to the House, within a period of fourteen days.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nParliamentary committees are formed to deliberate specific matters at length. The public is directly or indirectly associated and studies are conducted to help committees arrive at the conclusions. Parliamentary committees are of two kinds: Ad hoc committees and the Standing committees.[16][17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nStanding committees are permanent committees constituted from time to time in pursuance of the provisions of an act of Parliament or rules of procedure and conduct of business in Parliament. The work of these committees is of a continuing nature. Ad hoc committees are appointed for a specific purpose and they cease to exist when they finish the task assigned to them and submits a report.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 December 2001, Indian Parliament was attacked by an Islamic terrorist group. The perpetrators were Lashkar-e-Taiba (Let) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorists. The attack led to the deaths of five terrorists, six Delhi Police personnel, two Parliament Security Services personnel and a gardener, which totalled 14 fatalities. It also led to increased tensions between India and Pakistan, resulting in the 2001-2002 India-Pakistan standoff.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 16 November 2016, the winter session of Indian Parliament had started and during the sittings in both Upper and Lower Houses of Parliament, observed strong opposition, and uproar by political parties, on demonetisation (note ban) initiative by Narendra Modi Government on 8 November 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nJawaharlal Nehru and other members taking pledge during the midnight session of the Constituent Assembly of India held on 14 and 15 August 1947.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstituent Assembly of India\\r\\n\\r\\nJawaharlal Nehru addressing the Constituent Assembly in 1946.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian Prime Minister, Morarji Desai listens to Jimmy Carter as he addresses the Indian Parliament House.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident of the United States, Barack Obama addressing Joint Session of the Parliament in 2010.","input":"Which is big lok sabha or rajya sabha?"},{"output":"T-Mobile Arena","context":"Coordinates: 360610N 1151042W? / ?36.10278N 115.17833W? / 36.10278; -115.17833\\r\\nT-Mobile Arena is a multi-use indoor arena on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada.

Through the following year, Harrah's became uncertain on continuing with the project, not knowing if AEG would split the costs, and whether building a major league-ready stadium without a guaranteed franchise to play on it would be feasible given the enduring financial crisis.[6] The original plans were to break ground in June 2008 and finish the arena in 2010, but by 2009, it was revealed the stalled project had not even done a traffic study despite being located near a busy intersection.[7] In 2010, the plans were changed to use an area behind the Imperial Palace. However, given the financing would require a special taxation district, opposition from Clark County regarding using public money in the project stalled it even further.[8] AEG eventually backed out completely by 2012, once MGM Resorts International came up with their own project using a terrain behind the New York-New York and Monte Carlo resorts. This attracted AEG primarily for not relying on public funding.[9]\\r\\nMGM and AEG announced their joint arena plan on March 1, 2013.[10] Plans were further fleshed out over the following months with the announcement of a $100-million pedestrian shopping area, The Park, to serve as a gateway to the arena,[11] and the retention of prominent sports architecture firm Populous to design the project.[12] Other firms on the project include: the ICON Venue Group,[13] Thornton Tomasetti,[14] ME Engineers,[15] Penta Building Group and Hunt Construction Group.[16]\\r\\nThe project broke ground on May 1, 2014,[17] followed by the demolition of existing buildings, and excavation of an oval area for the arena.

As many as 1,767 claims were settled toward accidental insurance to RuPay Card holders under the government's flagship financial inclusion programme Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) as said by PM on 15 August 2017. In next phase, micro insurance & pension etc. will also be added.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the scheme:[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the preparations done in the run-up, as mentioned above, on the inauguration day, 1.5 Crore (15 million) bank accounts were opened.[2] The Prime Minister said on this occasion- \\"Let us celebrate today as the day of financial freedom.\\" By September 2014, 3.02 crore accounts were opened under the scheme, amongst Public sector banks, SBI had opened 30 lakh (3 million) accounts, followed by Punjab National Bank with 20.24 lakh (2 million) accounts, Canara Bank 16.21 lakh (1.62 million) accounts, Central Bank of India 15.98 lakh (1.59 million) accounts and Bank of Baroda with 14.22 lakh (1.42 million) accounts.[11] On 20 January 2015, the scheme entered into Guinness book of world records setting new record for 'The most bank accounts opened in one week'.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe balance in Jan Dhan accounts rose by more than ?270 billion (US$3.9?billion) between 9 November 2016 and 23 November 2016.[13] 19 lakh householders have availed the overdraft facility of ?2.56 billion (US$37?million) by May 2016.[10] Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have got 29% of the total deposits under the scheme,[9] whereas Kerala and Goa became the first states in the country to provide one basic bank account to every household.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total number of account holders stood at 294.8 million, including 176.1 million account holders from  rural and semi-urban branches.

The amount of deposits rose to ?656.97 billion (US$9.6?billion) by August 2017.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to an analysis of various studies, \\"Beyond enabling account ownership and the use of financial services, the PMJDY also facilitated financial inclusion for a variety of demographics. While the programme has made significant headway towards genuine financial inclusion, it is clear that improving policy communication, widening and deepening progress in low-income states, and ironing out the kinks in the bank-agent model will be crucial if these hard-fought gains are to prove sustainable.\\"[15] At least 30 crore new families have got Jan Dhan accounts in which almost Rs 65,000 crore have been deposited, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on 28 August 2017, on the eve of third anniversary of the scheme aimed at financial inclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scheme has been criticized by opposition as an effort to please voters that has created unnecessary work-burden on the public-sector banks. It has been claimed that the poor deserve food more than bank accounts and financial security. Further, these accounts have not yet added considerable profits to PSU banks.[16][17][18][19] According to the experts, offers like zero balance, free insurance and overdraft facility would result in duplication. Many individuals who already have bank accounts may have had accounts created for themselves, lured by the insurance covers and overdraft facilities.[20] As per the scheme, a very few people are eligible to get the life insurance worth ?30,000 (US$440) with a validity of just five years.[21] The claimed overdraft facility has been completely left upon the banks. As per the government notice, only those people would get the overdraft facility whose transaction record has satisfactory operations in their account for some time.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, while the Indian Government was actively attempting to promote financial inclusion through this scheme, the Reserve Bank of India, then headed by Raghuram Rajan, permitted banks to charge customers for conducting ATM transactions beyond a certain number of times per month.

Newsweek reported him looking back on the incident from the vantage of 1981: \\"When I tried to buy lingerie for my wife,\\" he recalls, \\"I was faced with racks of terry-cloth robes and ugly floral-print nylon nightgowns, and I always had the feeling the department store saleswomen thought I was an unwelcome intruder.\\"[8] Raymond spent the next eight years studying the lingerie market.[9][10]\\r\\nAt the time when Raymond founded Victoria's Secret, most women in America purchased \\"dowdy\\", \\"pragmatic\\", \\"foundation garments\\" by Fruit of the Loom, Hanes, and Jockey in packs of three from department stores and saved \\"fancier items\\" for \\"special occasions\\" like honeymoons.[11] \\"Lacy thongs and padded push-up bras\\" were niche products during this period found \\"alongside feathered boas and provocative pirate costumes at Frederick's of Hollywood\\" outside of the mainstream product offerings available at department stores.[11]\\r\\nIn 1977, Raymond borrowed $40,000 from his parents and $40,000 from a bank to establish Victoria's Secret: a store in which men could feel comfortable buying lingerie.[7][12] The company's first store was located in Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto, California.[7]\\r\\nRaymond picked the name \\"Victoria\\" after Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom to associate with the refinement of the Victorian era. The \\"Secret\\" was what was hidden underneath the clothes. The angels comes from his wife being in a sorority where their mascot was an angel.[12]\\r\\nVictoria's Secret grossed $500,000 in its first year of business,[7] enough to finance the expansion from a headquarters and warehouse to four new store locations[13] and a mail-order operation.[7]\\r\\nBy 1982, the fourth store (still in the San Francisco area) was added at 395 Sutter Street.[14] Victoria's Secret stayed at that location until 1990, when it moved to the larger Powell Street frontage of the Westin St. Francis.[15]\\r\\nIn April 1982, Raymond sent out his 12th catalog; each catalog cost $3 (equivalent to $7.61 in 2017).[14] Catalog sales accounted for 55% of the company's $7 million annual sales in 1982.[14]\\r\\nThe Victoria's Secret stores at this time were \\"a niche player\\" in the underwear market. The business was described as \\"more burlesque than Main Street.\\"[16]\\r\\nIn 1982, Victoria's Secret had grown to five stores, a 40-page catalog, and was grossing $6 million annually.[7] Raymond sold Victoria's Secret Inc. to Leslie Wexner, creator of Limited Stores Inc of Columbus, Ohio, for $1 million.[7][17][18]\\r\\nIn 1983, Wexner revamped Victoria's Secret's sales model.

Victoria's Secret mails more than 400 million of its catalogs per year.[71]\\r\\nDuring the 1990s, store sizes grew from the average 1,400 square feet to between 4,000 and 5,000 square feet.[54] In 2002, the average Victoria's Secret store was 6,000 square feet.[72][73]\\r\\nUp until the early 2000s, management at Victoria's Secret actively decided to not expand outside the United States.[74] The drive to continue growing coupled with facing a maturing of the American retail market led to a change in that decision and to expand Victoria's Secret outside the United States.[74] Victoria's Secret announced the company's plan to expand into Canada in 2010.[75] The company opened 23 stores[citation needed] stores in Canada with locations in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec,[76] Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan.\\r\\nIn November 2005, the company opened its first boutique in the United Kingdom at Heathrow Airport, Terminal 5 with the help of World Duty Free.[77] This was followed in 2009 with several Victoria's Secret Travel and Tourism stores residing within airports outside the United States. These include locations in Schiphol International Airport, The Netherlands.[78][79]\\r\\nVictoria's Secret opened their first store located at the Westfield Shopping Centre, Stratford, London[80] on July 24, 2012.[81] Their flagship 40,386-square-foot- (3,752.0?m2) store on New Bond Street, London opened on August 29, 2012,[82] and there will be further nationwide expansion across the United Kingdom. Victoria's Secret executive vice president and chief administrative officer Martyn R Redgrave told Women's Wear Daily \\"That's what we're looking to do as we expand, in the UK in particular, and those will be company-owned and operated\\".[83] Since 2013, stores opened across the United Kingdom in Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield, Birmingham, Bristol and London including Westfield London, Bluewater and Brent Cross. As of 2016, there are 15 stores in the United Kingdom.[84]\\r\\nIn 2010, Victoria's Secret expanded with franchises internationally.\\r\\nThe first franchise store in Latin America opened in Isla Margarita, Venezuela on June 25, 2010 followed by other stores in the country, and in Bogota, Colombia, in July 2012 selling beauty products and accessories. Angel's Group, the Colombian company operating the franchise, is planning to open 10 stores in Colombia.[85] Victoria's Secret is also planning on opening a store in the exclusive Multiplaza Mall in San Salvador, El Salvador.[86]\\r\\nIn 2010, M.H. Alshaya Co. opened the first Victoria's Secret store in the Middle East region in Kuwait. M.H. Alshaya Co. operates the Victoria's Secret franchise located in the Marina Mall selling products including \\"cosmetic and branded accessories, but it has left out the brand's infamous lingerie line\\".[87]\\r\\nThe brand's first Caribbean store opened in November 2011 at Plaza Las Americas in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[88] Two stores also opened in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic at the Agora,[89] (mainly selling beauty products and accessories) and Sambil Santo Domingo[90] malls in August 2012 and October 2012, respectively.\\r\\nThe first Polish store opened in July 2012 at the Z?ote Tarasy shopping mall in Warsaw and is operated by M.H. Alshaya Co. It was the first Victoria's Secret franchise store in Europe,[91] and it opened just a day before the first British store in London.[83]\\r\\nThe first Serbian Victoria's Secret store opened in January 2014 at the Nikola Tesla Airport in Belgrade.[92] This was the first Victoria's Secret store to open in the former Yugoslavia.\\r\\nPrior to the emergence of e-commerce, the Victoria's Secret's catalogs provided both an informative and exciting experience in the comfort of the consumer's home.[70]\\r\\nThe catalog under Raymond's leadership took the form of an upmarket version of Frederick's of Hollywood lingerie catalog being more sensuous than the catalog published under the future leadership of The Limited.[94] In 1982 the Victoria's Secret catalog cost $3.[14]\\r\\nThe New York Times reported that the financial success of Victoria's Secret catalogs influenced other catalogs, which changed to present lingerie as \\"romantic and sensual but tasteful\\" \\"in which models are photographed in ladylike poses against elegant backgrounds.\\"[14]\\r\\nThis led to Victoria's Secret dominating the catalog field for \\"lingerie and sexy nightwear.\\" The catalogs allowed for consumers to review the entire spectrum of product offerings, along the axes of style, color and fabric. Victoria's Secret accepted catalog orders via telephone 24 hours a day.[70]\\r\\nVictoria's Secret's catalog offers a more diverse range of merchandise.[72]\\r\\nThe Los Angeles Times described the catalog in 2000 as having achieved \\"an almost cult-like following.\\"[65]\\r\\nIn 1995 Victoria's Secret began building its e-commerce website which the company launched after three years of development at 6 p.m. December 4, 1998, using the domain VictoriasSecret.com.[93] Twenty minutes later the first order was placed on the website from a Littleton, Colorado, customer at 6:20?p.m.[95]\\r\\nIt was reported that the three year development was a result of the company's concern of rolling out a half-baked website that could \\"discourage return visits\\".[93]\\r\\nViewers who logged onto the Victoria's Secret's website to view the company's first webcast of their fashion show on February 3, 1999, were unable to view the webcast due to the Internet infrastructure Victoria Secret's selected was unable to meet user demand causing some users to be unable to view the webcast.[96]\\r\\nThe Limited, Inc in 1998 created Intimate Beauty Corporation with a mandate to establish a group of beauty businesses with Victoria's Secret Beauty being the first company in the firm's portfolio.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn November 2012 Susie Coulter became president of Victoria's Secret Beauty; the company's beauty division located in New York City[97]\\r\\nVictoria's Secret was originally owned by \\"The Limited\\".[98] In 2002 Wexner reincorporated Victoria's Secret into the Limited; previously Victoria's Secret's parent company was Intimate Brands, a separately traded entity whose President was Ed Razek.[16][99]\\r\\nBy 2006, 72% of Limited Brands' revenueand almost all of their profitscame from their Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works units.[100]\\r\\nOn July 10, 2007, the Victoria's Secret parent company, Limited Brands, sold a 75% interest in their apparel brands, Limited Stores and Express to Sun Capital Partners, to focus on expanding their Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works units.[101] The immediate impact of the sale resulted in Limited Brands taking a $42 million after-tax loss.[102]\\r\\nIn 1985, Howard Gross was promoted to president from vice president.[21] In 1991 Grace Nichols replaced Gross as president of Victoria's Secret Stores. Nichols previously had been \\"executive vice president and general merchandise manager of Limited's lingerie division.\\"[103]\\r\\nIn 1998, Cynthia A. Fields became the president & chief executive of the company (when it was a division of Intimate Brands Inc.).[93][104]\\r\\nIn May 2000, Wexner installed Sharen Jester Turney, who had previously worked at Neiman Marcus Direct, as the new chief executive of Victoria's Secret Direct.[37]\\r\\nIn May 2006, Christine Beauchamp was named president and CEO of Victoria's Secret Beauty. Beauchamp was succeeded by Shashi Batra in 2009, who became president of Victoria's Secret Beauty.[105] Robin Burns was CEO of Victoria's Secret Beauty.[74]\\r\\nAfter two years of pressure from environmentalist groups, Victoria's Secret's parent firm and a conservation group reached an agreement to make the lingerie retailer's catalog more environmentally friendly in 2006.[106] [107] The catalog would no longer be made of pulp supplied from any woodland caribou habitat range in Canada, unless it has been certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. The catalogs will also be made of 10 percent recycled paper.[108]\\r\\nThe company has bought organic and fair trade-grown cotton to make some of its panties.[109][110]\\r\\nOn March 4, 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Victoria's Secret in Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc. that there must be proof of actual harm to the trademark.[111][112]\\r\\nIn 2006 it was reported that Victoria's Secret paid workers $7 per day to make bras for them in Thai factories.[113]\\r\\nOne-tenth of all Victoria's Secret bras are sourced via Intimate Fashions, a manufacturer with factories in the South Indian city of Guduvanchery.[114][115][citation needed]\\r\\nAs a by-result of the JordanÿUnited States Free Trade Agreement, which retreated from standards established in the 1990s, working conditions in Jordan have been compared to slave labour.[116]\\r\\nPrior to the 1982 sale, the company's business name was Victoria's Secret, Inc. then afterwards the name was changed to Victoria's Secret Stores, Inc. In 2005, the company changed to Victoria's Secret Stores, LLC.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the early 1980s, Victoria's Secret used FCB/Leber Katz Partners for the development of their brand, marketing, and advertising.[52]\\r\\nIn 1989, FCB/Leber Katz Partners and Victoria's Secret executed a national advertising campaign featuring for the first time in the company's history a ten-page glossy insert that appeared in the November issue of Elle, Vogue, Vanity Fair, Victoria, House Beautiful, Bon Appetit, New Woman, and People magazines.[54] Victoria's Secret used the insert to announce their expansion into the toiletries and fragrance business.[54] Up until the ten-page insert, the company's growth had been driven by their catalog, sporadic ads in fashion publications, and word of mouth.[54] Catalogs were discontinued in early 2016.\\r\\nOver the course of the company's evolution, Victoria's Secret \\"has gone from being value-driven to creating a luxury-shopping experience and an aura of fashion associated with its product\\" which has been driven marketing.[74]\\r\\nThe Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is an annual \\"elaborate marketing tool for Limited Brands\\".[117] The show is a mix of \\"beautiful models scantily clad in lingerie\\" and A-list entertainers \\"And every year, it becomes less about fashion and more about show\\".[117]\\r\\nThe company gained notoriety in the early 1990s after it began to use supermodels in its advertising and fashion shows. Throughout the 2000s, Victoria's Secret has turned down celebrity models and endorsements.[118]\\r\\nIn 1999, Victoria's Secret's 30 second Super Bowl advertisement led to one million visits to the company's website within an hour of airing.[119]\\r\\nIn 2004, Victoria's Secret featured Bob Dylan in an advertisement to test new marketing possibilities while Victoria's Secret dropped their fashion show for 2004 as a result of the fallout from the Janet Jackson/Super Bowl incident that caused complaints from women's groups.[120][121][122]\\r\\nThe brand turned to social networking in 2009, opening an official Facebook page and later on official Twitter and Pinterest accounts. It also expanded its website to feature behind-the-scenes content about its catalog and commercial shoots, as well as its fashion show.\\r\\nThe company created a campaign to market its \\"Body\\" bra line called \\"The Perfect Body.\\" The campaign has elicited substantial controversy, with many sources saying it will lower women's self-esteem because it does not embrace all body types.[123]\\r\\nIn 1995, Victoria's Secret began holding their annual Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, which is broadcast on primetime American television.[124] Starting with the 1995 fashion show, they are \\"a combination of self-assured strutting for women and voyeuristic pleasures for menand lingerie becomes mainstream entertainment.\\"[125]\\r\\nKen Weil, vice president at Victoria's Secret, and Tim Plzak, responsible for IT at Victoria's Secret's parent company Intimate Brands, led Victoria's Secret's first-ever online streaming of their fashion show in 1999.[99] The 18 minutes webcast streamed February 2, 1999, was at the time the Internet's \\"biggest event\\" since inception.[99] The 1999 webcast was reported as a failure by a number of newspapers on account of some user's inability to watch the show featuring Tyra Banks, Heidi Klum, and Stephanie Seymour[126] as a result of Victoria's Secret's technology falling short being able to meet the online user demand resulting in network congestion and users who could see the webcast receiving jerky frames.[99] In all, the company's website saw over 1.5 million visits while the Broadcast.com's computer's were designed to handle between 250,000 and 500,000 simultaneous viewers.[127] In total, 1.5 million viewers either attempted or viewed the webcast.[128]\\r\\nThe 1999 webcast served to create a database for Victoria's Secret of over 500,000 current and potential customers by requiring users to submit their contact details to view the webcast.[99] The next spring Victoria's Secret avoided technical issues by partnering with Broadcast.com, America Online, and Microsoft.[99] The 2000 webcast attracted more than two million viewers.[38]\\r\\nBy 2011, the budget for the fashion show was $12 million up from the first show's budget of $120,000.[129]\\r\\nVictoria's Secret started working with renowned models in the early 1990s, with the hiring of Stephanie Seymour, Karen Mulder, Yasmeen Ghauri, and Jill Goodacre.[130][131][132] These models helped the brand gain notice and soon enough were featured in televised commercials.[131] Veronica Webb is one of the original Victoria's Secret model.[133]\\r\\nAngels is one of Victoria's Secret's lingerie lines, which was launched in 1997, with a commercial featuring Helena Christensen, Karen Mulder, Daniela Pe?tov, Stephanie Seymour, and Tyra Banks as well as pop star Tom Jones.[134][135] The commercial was a major success and the Angels began to be featured in various commercials, alongside other contract models for the brand such as Yasmeen Ghauri,[136] Ins Rivero,[citation needed] and Laetitia Casta.[citation needed] From then onwards, the term Angel started to become synonymous with being a contracted spokesmodel for the brand and in February 1998, the Angels made their runway debut at Victoria's Secret's 4th annual fashion show, with Chandra North filling in for Christensen.[137]\\r\\nSeymour, Mulder, Pestova, Banks, Casta, and new brazilian model Millena Gomes were all featured in both of Victoria's Secret webcast and took part in the promotion as the brand's contract models.[138] Starting 2001, the show has been televised and usually features the year's Angel line-up at the start of the show, starting with Pestova, Banks, Klum, Adriana Lima and Gisele Bundchen[nb 1] In 2004, due to the Super Bowl controversy, instead of a televised show, Victoria's Secret sent its five contract models (Banks, Klum, Bundchen, Adriana Lima, and Alessandra Ambrosio) on a tour called Angels Across America, as by then, the word had become synonymous with Victoria's Secret spokesmodels.[139] The last original Angel, Tyra Banks, departed the following year, as Karolina Kurkova, Selita Ebanks, and Izabel Goulart were hired.[140]\\r\\nAmong other recognitions, the Victoria's Secret Angels were chosen to be part of People magazine's annual \\"100 Most Beautiful People in the World\\" issue in 2007[141] and became the first trademark awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on November 13, 2007, with Klum, Lima, Ambrosio, Kurkova, Goulart, Ebanks, Marisa Miller, and Miranda Kerr at hand.[142] Alongside new Angel Doutzen Kroes, they also took part in the grand reopening of the Fontainebleau in Miami in 2008.[143] In 2009, it was widely reported that Candice Swanepoel, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Chanel Iman, Emanuela de Paula and Lindsay Ellingson had been hired by the brand.[144] However, De Paula was absent from the fashion show and Erin Heatherton was credited in her place, alongside the Angels (Klum, Ambrosio, Kerr, Miller, Kroes, and Behati Prinsloo, with Lima being on maternity leave).[145] The brand also held a nationwide competition to hire a new \\"runway Angel\\" (as are dubbed all the models who walk in the show), Kylie Bisutti was crowned as the winner but soon parted ways with the brand.[146] In the following year-and-a-half Swanepoel, Huntington-Whiteley, Iman, Heatherton, and Ellingson all were revealed as Angels.\\r\\nVarious tours have been held featuring the Angels, such as the Bombshell Tour in 2010 (featuring Laura Croggon, Sophia Timpano, Katie Bryan, and new recruit Lily Aldridge), a VSX tour in 2013 (featuring Swanepoel, Ambrosio, Ellingson, and Aldridge) and a Swim Tour in 2013 (featuring Swanepoel, Ellingson, and Heatherton). The Angels have been heavily featured on the brand's social media, including on a short-lived Facebook application in 2013-2014 highlighting the Angels (then including Lima, Swanepoel, Ellingson, Aldridge, and Karlie Kloss) as well as Lais Ribeiro, Toni Garrn, and Barbara Palvin.[citation needed]\\r\\nEllingson, Kroes, and Kloss all departed soon after the 2014 fashion show, leaving the brand with only 5 Angels.[147][148] In 2015, the Angels as well as models Elsa Hosk, Joan Smalls, Lais Ribeiro, Martha Hunt, Jasmine Tookes, Stella Maxwell, and Monika 'Jac' Jagaciak were featured on the brand's first ever Swim Special. Soon after, in the brand's biggest group hiring ever, all but Smalls were revealed as Angels, along with longtime catalog regulars Lais Ribeiro and Sara Sampaio as well as Kate Grigorieva, Taylor Hill, and Romee Strijd.[149][150] The following year, Jagaciak and Griegorieva exited, while catalog regular Josephine Skriver was added to the roster.[151] In 2017, Alessandra Ambrosio announced that the yearly fashion show would be her last.[152]\\r\\nOther notable spokesmodels for the brand have included: Claudia Schiffer,[153] Eva Herzigov,[137] Oluchi Onweagba,[154] Jessica Stam,[155] Ana Beatriz Barros,[156] and Bregje Heinen[157] as well as a handful of celebrities such as Taylor Momsen.[158]\\r\\nIn the article \\"Victorias Dirty Secret: How Sociocultural Norms Influence Adolescent Girls and Women\\" written by Strahan, Lafrance, Wilson, and Ethier from Wilfrid Laurier University along with Spencer and Zanna from the University of Waterloo[200] have stated: \\"Women's body dissatisfaction is influenced by sociocultural norms for ideal appearance that are pervasive in society and particularly directed at women.\\" These norms tell women that they are valued for their bodies, physical appearance, and scale of attractiveness. Girls as young as 10 years old start dieting because they are struggling with their weight and body perception. This will continue throughout their life span. Victoria's Secret sends a message to these adolescent girls and women that their models are the standard of beauty. The models are shown on TV commercials, ads, and magazines meaning it is seen on an everyday basis. Girls are comparing themselves with these high unrealistic standards that is captivated by the media. Women in these ads are highly objectified, idealized, and sexualized. If women feel they have to live up to this sociocultural norm standard, it is only telling men that it is okay to objectify and sexualize women. The article concludes by stating: \\"Exposure to societal messages that reflect the sociocultural norm for ideal appearance has a negative effect on women.\\"[200]\\r\\nIn 2009, Victoria's Secret was sued several times. The lawsuits alleged that defective underwear contained formaldehyde that caused severe rashes on women who wore them. Six cases were filed in Ohio and two in Florida. At least 17 other suits were filed in six other states after January 2008.[201][202][203] The plaintiff refused to submit to a simple patch test to determine the precise cause of her reaction and her case was later withdrawn.[204] The Formaldehyde Council issued a statement that formaldehyde quickly dissipates in air, water and sunlight.[205]\\r\\nIn 2012, a Victoria's Secret supplier was investigated for use of child labor in harvesting cotton used to make its products.[206][207][208]\\r\\nAlso in 2012, Victoria's Secret was sued by Zephyrs, \\"accused of breaching a 2001 agreement and selling cheap 'knockoffs' of the company's stockings.\\"[209]\\r\\nThe company drew criticism for a newly released lingerie collection titled \\"Go East\\" whose tagline pledged to women the capacity to \\"indulge in touches of eastern delight with lingerie inspired by the exquisite beauty of secret Japanese gardens.\\"[83][210] The collection included a mesh teddy \\"Sexy Little Geisha\\" featuring \\"flirty cutouts and Eastern-inspired florals\\".\\r\\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the collection was \\"accessorized with a miniature fan and a kimono-esque obi sash.\\"\\r\\nVictoria's Secret removed the Asian-themed collection \\"that traded in sexualized, generic pan-Asian ethnic stereotypes.\\"[3][211][212]\\r\\nIn 2014, a petition against the newly released lingerie collection called \\"Body\\" was created when the poster ads displayed the words 'THE PERFECT \\"BODY\\"' over well-known VS Angels. The petition, while becoming popular across social media, demanded that Victoria's Secret \\"apologise and take responsibility for the unhealthy and damaging message that their Perfect Body campaign sends out about womens bodies and how they should be judged.\\"\\r\\nThe petition also demanded a change in the wording on Victoria's Secret advertisements for their bra range Body, to something that does not promote unhealthy and unrealistic standards of beauty,\\" asking the company to not use such harmful marketing in the future. Petitioners created the hashtag \\"#iamperfect\\", which trended on Twitter for body shaming women. The petition had over 30,000 signatures.\\r\\nAlthough there was never a formal apology released, Victoria's Secret took note of the petition and changed the words on their ad campaign to 'A BODY FOR EVERY BODY.'\\r\\nAt the 2016 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, the brand was accused of \\"cultural appropriation\\" during the segment \\"The Road Ahead\\" that drew inspiration from Chinese culture. Kendall Jenners flame tail, Elsa Hosks dragon costume, and Adriana Limas embroidered thigh-high boots is what caused an uproar because many fans thought that it was inappropriate for women of other cultures to wear those items that meant so much to the Chinese culture. The reason behind Victoria's Secret including this segment to the 2016 fashion show is because of their recent expansion into the Chinese market. They thought it would be a good way to appeal to the new Chinese customer. No apology or statement was released from the brand.[213]","input":"Who was the creator of victoria's secret?"},{"output":"New Zealanders, colloquially known as Kiwis","context":"New Zealanders, colloquially known as Kiwis,[8][9] are people associated with New Zealand, sharing a common history, culture, and language (New Zealand English). People of various ethnicities and national origins are citizens of New Zealand, governed by its nationality law.\\r\\nOriginally composed solely of the indigenous Mori, the ethnic makeup of the population has been dominated since the 19th century by New Zealanders of European descent, mainly of Scottish, English, Welsh and Irish ancestry, with smaller percentages of other European ancestries such as German, Dutch, Scandinavian and South Slavic. Today, the ethnic makeup of the New Zealand population is undergoing a process of change, with new waves of immigration, higher birth rates and increasing interracial marriage resulting in the New Zealand population of Mori, Asian, Pacific Islander and multiracial descent growing at a higher rate than those of solely European descent, with such groups projected to make up a larger proportion of the population in the future.[10] New Zealand has an estimated resident population of around 4,793,700 (as of June 2017).[11] Over one million New Zealanders recorded in the 2013 New Zealand census were born overseas.[12]\\r\\nWhile most New Zealanders are resident in New Zealand, there is also a significant diaspora, estimated at around 750,000. Of these, around 640,800 lived in Australia (a June 2013 estimate[update]),[1] which was equivalent to 7001140000000000000?14% of the domestic population of New Zealand. Other communities of New Zealanders abroad are predominantly concentrated in other English-speaking countries, specifically the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, with smaller numbers located elsewhere.[2]\\r\\nDespite its multiethnic composition, the culture held in common by most New Zealanders can also be referred to as mainstream New Zealand culture, a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of British and other Northern European colonists, settlers, and immigrants. It also includes influences of Mori culture. Large-scale immigration in the 20th and 21st centuries from Asia, such as Chinese and Indians, introduced a variety of elements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table above shows the broad ethnic composition of the New Zealand population at the 1961 census compared to that from the most recent data of the 2013 census. People of European descent constituted the majority of the 4.2 million people living in New Zealand, with 2,969,391 or 74.0% of the population in the 2013 New Zealand census.[16] Those of full or part-Mori ancestry comprise 14.9% of New Zealanders. The residual \\"others\\" ethnic group consists largely of Asians and Pacific Islanders.[13]\\r\\nMost European New Zealanders are of British and Irish ancestry, with smaller percentages of other European ancestries such as Germans, Poles (historically noted as German due to Partitions of Poland), French, Dutch, Scandinavian and South Slavs.[17] In the 1961 census, over 90% self-identified as people of European descent.[13]\\r\\nThe Mori language loanword Pkeh has been used to refer to European New Zealanders, although others reject this appellation.[18][19] The word Pkeh today is increasingly used to refer to all non-Polynesian New Zealanders.[20]\\r\\nThe first Europeans known to have reached New Zealand were Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman and his crew in 1642.[21] Mori killed several of the crew and no more Europeans went to New Zealand until British explorer James Cook's voyage of 1768ÿ71.[21] Cook reached New Zealand in 1769 and mapped almost the entire coastline. Following Cook, New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American whaling, sealing and trading ships. They traded European food and goods, especially metal tools and weapons, for Mori timber, food, artefacts and water. On occasion, Europeans and Mori traded goods for sex.[22]\\r\\nBecoming aware of the lawless nature of European settlement and of increasing French interest in the territory, the British government appointed James Busby as British Resident to New Zealand in 1832. Busby failed to bring law and order to European settlement, but did oversee the introduction of the first national flag on 20 March 1834, after an unregistered New Zealand ship was seized in Australia. The nebulous United Tribes of New Zealand later, in October 1835, sent the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand to King William IV of the United Kingdom, asking him for protection. Ongoing unrest and the legal standing of the Declaration of Independence prompted the Colonial Office to send Captain William Hobson to New Zealand to claim sovereignty for the British Crown and negotiate a treaty with the Mori.[i] The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed in the Bay of Islands on 6 February 1840.[23] The drafting was done hastily and confusion and disagreement continue to surround the translation. The Treaty however remains regarded as New Zealand's foundation as a nation and is revered by Mori as a guarantee of their rights.\\r\\nIn response to New Zealand Company attempts to establish a separate colony in Wellington, and French claims in Akaroa, Hobson, now Lieutenant-Governor, declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on 21 May 1840. The two proclamations published in the New Zealand Advertiser and Bay Of Islands Gazette issue of 19 June 1840 \\"assert[s] on the grounds of Discovery, the Sovereign Rights of Her Majesty over the Southern Islands of New Zealand, commonly called 'The Middle Island' (South Island) and 'Stewart's Island' (Stewart Island/Rakiura); and the Island, commonly called 'The Northern Island', having been ceded Sovereignty to Her Majesty.\\" The second proclamation expanded on how sovereignty over the \\"Northern Island\\" had been ceded under the treaty signed that February.[24]\\r\\nFollowing the formalising of sovereignty, the organised and structured flow of migrants from Great Britain and Ireland began, and by 1860 more than 100,000 British and Irish settlers lived throughout New Zealand. The Otago Association actively recruited settlers from Scotland, creating a definite Scottish influence in that region, while the Canterbury Association recruited settlers from the south of England, creating a definite English influence over that region.[25] By 1870 the non-Mori population reached over 250,000.[26]\\r\\nOther settlers came from Germany, Scandinavia, and other parts of Europe as well as from China and the Indian subcontinent, but British and Irish settlers made up the vast majority, and did so for the next 150 years.[9]\\r\\nBetween 1881 and the 1920s, the New Zealand Parliament passed legislation that intended to limit Asiatic migration to New Zealand, and prevented Asians from naturalising.[27] In particular, the New Zealand government levied a poll tax on Chinese immigrants up until the 1930s, when Japan went to war with China. New Zealand finally abolished the poll tax in 1944. An influx of Jewish refugees from central Europe came in the 1930s. Many of the persons of Polish origin in New Zealand arrived as orphans from Eastern Poland via Siberia and Iran in 1944 during World War II.[28]\\r\\nWith the agencies of the United Nations dealing with humanitarian efforts following the Second World War, New Zealand accepted about 5,000 refugees and displaced persons from Europe, and more than 1,100 Hungarians between 1956 and 1959 (see Refugee migration into New Zealand). The post-WWII immigration included more persons from Greece, Italy, Poland and the former Yugoslavia.\\r\\nNew Zealand limited immigration to those who would meet a labour shortage in New Zealand. To encourage those to come, the Government introduced free and assisted passages in 1947, a schema expanded by the First National Government in 1950.[citation needed] However, when it became clear that not enough skilled migrants would come from the British Isles alone, recruitment began in Northern European countries. New Zealand signed a bilateral agreement for skilled migrants with the Netherlands, and a large number of Dutch immigrants arrived in New Zealand. Others came in the 1950s from Denmark, Germany, Switzerland and Austria to meet needs in specialised occupations. By the 1960s, the policy of excluding people based on nationality yielded a population overwhelmingly European in origin. By the mid-1960s, a desire for cheap unskilled labour led to ethnic diversification.\\r\\nThe Mori people are most likely descended from people who emigrated from Taiwan to Melanesia and then travelled east through to the Society Islands.[29] After a pause of 70 to 265 years, a new wave of exploration led to the discovery and settlement of New Zealand in about AD 1250ÿ1300,[30] making New Zealand one of the most recently settled major landmasses. Some researchers have suggested an earlier wave of arrivals dating to as early as AD 50ÿ150; these people then either died out or left the islands.[31][32][33]\\r\\nOver the following centuries the Polynesian settlers developed into a distinct culture now known as Mori. The population was divided into iwi (tribes) and hap (subtribes) which would cooperate, compete and sometimes fight with each other. At some point a group of Mori migrated to the Chatham Islands where they developed their distinct Moriori culture.[34][35]\\r\\nDue to New Zealand's geographic isolation, 500 years passed before the next phase of settlement, the arrival of Europeans. Only then did the indigenous inhabitants need to distinguish themselves from the new arrivals, using the term \\"Mori\\" which means \\"normal\\" or \\"ordinary\\".[36]\\r\\nIn the 1860s, disputes over questionable land purchases led to the Mori Wars, which resulted in large tracts of tribal land being confiscated by the colonial government. Settlements such as Parihaka in Taranaki have become almost legendary because of injustices done there.[37] With the loss of much of their land, Mori went into a period of decline, and in the late 19th century it was believed that the Mori population would cease to exist as a separate race and would be assimilated into the European population.\\r\\nHowever, the predicted decline did not occur, and numbers recovered. Despite a high degree of intermingling between the Mori and European populations, Mori were able to retain their cultural identity and in the 1960s and 1970s Moridom underwent a cultural revival.[38]\\r\\nThe Mori population has seen stability in the 21st century. In the 2013 Census, 598,602 people identified as being part of the Mori ethnic group, accounting for 14.9%[15] of the New Zealand population, while 668,724 people (17.5%) claimed Mori descent.[15] 278,199 people identified as of sole Mori ethnicity, while 291,015 identified as of both European and Mori ethnicity (with or without a third ethnicity), due to a high rate of intermarriage between the two cultures.[39] Under the Maori Affairs Amendment Act 1974, a Mori is defined as a person of the Mori race of New Zealand; and includes any descendant of such a Mori.\\"\\r\\nAccording to the 2006 census, the largest iwi by population is Ngpuhi (125,601), followed by Ngti Porou (71,049), Ngi Tahu (54,819) and Waikato (40,083). However, over 110,000 people of Mori descent in the 2013 census could not identify their iwi.[15] Outside of New Zealand, a large Mori population exists in Australia, estimated at 155,000 in 2011.[40] The Mori Party has suggested a special seat should be created in the New Zealand parliament representing Mori in Australia.[41] Smaller communities also exist in the United Kingdom (approx. 8,000), the United States (up to 3,500) and Canada (approx. 1,000).[42][43]\\r\\nThe most common region this group lived in was Auckland Region (23.9 percent or 142,770 people). They are the second-largest ethnic group in New Zealand, after European New Zealanders. In addition, more than 120,000 Mori live in Australia. The Mori language (known as Te Reo Mori) is still spoken to some extent by about a fifth of all Mori, representing 3% of the total population. Many New Zealanders regularly use Mori words and expressions, such as \\"kia ora\\", while speaking English. Mori are active in all spheres of New Zealand culture and society, with independent representation in areas such as media, politics and sport.\\r\\nIn the 2013 Census, Asian ancestries total was 11.8% of the population, Chinese remained the largest Asian ethnic group in 2013, with 171,411 people while Indian was the second-largest Asian ethnic group in 2013, with 155,178 with Filipino a distant third with 40,350 people.[15]\\r\\nThe Asian component actually predates the Pacific component. There had been people of Asian ethnicity living in New Zealand from the early days of European settlement, albeit in very small numbers. During the period of gold rushes later in the nineteenth century the number of Chinese temporary settlers both from China and from Australia and America increased sharply. This was an interlude in many respects, though there was a small population which remained and settled permanently. However, a century later in the 1980s and 1990s the number of people of Asian ethnicities grew rapidly, and they are likely to exceed the Pacific population within the next few years.\\r\\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, New Zealand encouraged migrants from the South Pacific.[44] The country had a large demand for unskilled labour in the manufacturing sector. As long as this demand continued, migrants were encouraged by the government to come from the South Pacific, and many overstayed. However, when the boom times stopped, some blamed the migrants for the economic downturn affecting the country, and many of those people suffered dawn raids from 1974.\\r\\nThis component was 1.2% of the total population in the 2013 census.[15] The Latin American ethnic group almost doubled in size between the 2006 and 2013 censuses, increasing from 6,654 people to 13,182. A more recent component comprises refugees and other settlers from Africa and the Middle East, most recently from Somalia. While there had been previous settlers from the Middle East, such as Syrians, people from Equatorial Africa have been very few in the past.\\r\\nIn 2013, 67,752 people or 1.7% self-identified with one or more ethnicities other than European, Mori, Pacific, Asian, Middle Eastern, Latin American, and African. The vast majority of these people, 65,973 people, identified only as New Zealander.[15][45]\\r\\nSuccessive government policies on the relationship between Mori and non-Mori people have worsened race relations. After 1840, many issues to do with sovereignty and land ownership remained unresolved and, for a long time, invisible while Mori lived in rural communities. When Mori and Pkeh began living in closer proximity, the belief that the country had \\"the best race relations in the world\\" was tested. The first Race Relations Concilitator was appointed in 1971 to help combat racial discrimination among New Zealanders.[46]\\r\\nAgitation regarding Treaty of Waitangi violations intensified in the 1970s. The Waitangi Tribunal was set up in 1975 to consider alleged breaches, and in 1984 was empowered to look back to 1840.[47]\\r\\nNew Zealand culture is essentially a Western culture influenced by the unique environment and geographic isolation of the islands, and the cultural input of the Mori and the various waves of multi-ethnic migration which followed the British colonisation of New Zealand. British settlers brought a legal, political, and economic system that has flourished, along with the British system of agriculture that has transformed the landscape. The British brought the Protestant work ethicthe industrious newcomers astonished Mori people. In return, settlers noted the athletic ability, musicality, and courage of the Mori. However, British paternalism soon brought an extensive welfare system that created a large Mori underclass.[48]\\r\\nThe development of a New Zealand identity and national character, separate from the British colonial identity, is most often linked with the period surrounding the First World War, which gave rise to the concept of the Anzac spirit.[49] However, cultural links between New Zealand and Great Britain are maintained by a common language, sustained immigration from the UK, and the fact that many young New Zealanders spend time in Britain on \\"overseas experience\\", known as \\"OE\\".[50] New Zealanders also identify closely with Australians, as a result of the two nations' shared historical, cultural and geographic characteristics.[51]\\r\\nThe New Zealand government promotes Mori culture by supporting Mori-language schools, by ensuring the language is visible in government departments and literature, by insisting on traditional Mori welcomes (pwhiri) at government functions and state school award programs,[52] and by having Mori run the welfare services targeted at their people.[53]\\r\\nNew Zealanders are distinctive for their twangy dialect of English and propensity to travel long distances, and are quickly associated with the All Blacks rugby team and the haka. A tradition of resourcefulness came from the pioneering backgrounds of both European and Mori colonists.\\r\\nZealandia is a national personification of New Zealand and New Zealanders. In her stereotypical form, Zealandia appears as a woman of European descent who is dressed in flowing robes (or gown).[54][55] She is similar in dress and appearance to Britannia (the female personification of Britain), who is said to be the mother of Zealandia.[55]\\r\\nAs a rhetorical evocation of a New Zealand national identity,[54] Zealandia appeared on postage stamps, posters, cartoons, war memorials, and New Zealand government publications most commonly during the first half of the 20th century. The personification was a commonly used symbol of the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition, which was held in Wellington in 1939 and 1940.[54] Two large Zealandia statues serve as war memorials that honour the casualties of the Second Boer War: one is in Waimate and the other is in Palmerston.[54] Some smaller statues exist in museums and in private hands.\\r\\nThe female figure who appears on the left side of the national coat of arms has been identified as Zealandia[56] (in a \\"cut down nightie\\").[55]\\r\\nEnglish (New Zealand English) is the dominant language spoken by New Zealanders, and a de facto official language of New Zealand. According to the 2013 New Zealand census,[57] 96.1% of New Zealanders spoke English. The country's de jure official languages are Mori (Te Reo) and New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL). Other languages are also used by ethnic communities.\\r\\nJust under half of the population at the 2013 census[57] declared an affiliation to Christianity. However, regular church attendance is probably closer to 15%.[58] Before European colonisation the religion of the indigenous Mori population was animistic, but the subsequent efforts of missionaries such as Samuel Marsden resulted in most Mori converting to Christianity.\\r\\nReligious affiliation has been collected in the New Zealand census since 1851. One of the many complications in interpreting religious affiliation data in New Zealand is the large proportion who object to answering the question, roughly 173,000 in 2013. Most reporting of percentages is based on the total number of responses, rather than the total population.\\r\\nIn the early 20th century New Zealand census data indicates that the vast majority of New Zealanders affiliated with Christianity. The total percentages in the 1921 non-Mori census were 45% Anglicans, 19.9% Presbyterians, 13.6% Catholics, 9.5% Methodists and 11.2% Others. Statistics for Mori were only available from 1936, with 35.8% Anglicans, 19.9% Ratana, 13.9% Catholics, 7.2% Ringatu, 7.1% Methodists, 6.5% Latter Day Saints, 1.3% Methodists and 8.3% Others recorded at this census.[59]","input":"What is a citizen of new zealand called?"},{"output":"the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.

He was replaced by Cuban boxer Yordenis Ugs.[27] On July 29, it was reported that Gervonta Davis would defend his IBF junior lightweight title against former WBO champion Roman 'Rocky' Martinez.[28] Martnez was dropped due to not having enough time to make the 130 pound [59?kg] limit.[29] Instead Davis has been rescheduled to fight unbeaten prospect Francisco Fonseca.[30] On August 9, 2017, it was announced that Nathan Cleverly would defend his WBA light heavyweight title against Money Team fighter Badou Jack.[31][32]\\r\\nA mural was painted in McGregor's Dublin training facility, Straight Blast Gym, depicting McGregor hitting Mayweather with a left-handed punch.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the fight was televised via Showtime pay-per-view, available through both traditional television providers and various digital services, including the Showtime PPV website and apps, and UFC.tv. Fathom Events organized public screenings at venues such as cinemas.[34][35][36] On July 10, 2017, it was announced that pricing for the PPV in the U.S. would mirror that of Mayweather vs. Pacquiao, being set at US$89.95 (with an additional $10 charge for high definition).[37]\\r\\nThe fight was called by Showtime's lead commentary team of Mauro Ranallo (play-by-play), Al Bernstein (color), and Paulie Malignaggi (color), along with ringside reporter Jim Gray.[38] Showtime produced a four-part documentary series, All Access: Mayweather vs. McGregor, focusing on the preparations for the fight.[39] Fox Sports (the television rightsholder of the UFC) provided shoulder programming for the fight, including coverage of the press tour on UFC Tonight, as well as a pre-show and preliminary card on Fox and Fox Deportes.[37]\\r\\nDue to the high demand, a large number of television providers, as well as UFC.tv, experienced technical issues with their carriage of the PPV. The main event was delayed by an hour from its projected start time in order to address these problems.[40] Following the fight, a class-action lawsuit was proposed in Oregon against Showtime Networks for unlawful trading practices and unjust enrichment, alleging that the network knowingly advertised a level of quality it was unable to deliver with the amount of bandwidth it allocated, as the plaintiff and others had experienced technical issues with the PPV stream, including errors, buffering and low video quality.[41] Showtime and the UFC stated that they were investigating their respective customer complaints, and would issue refunds on a case-by-case basis.[42]\\r\\nSky Sports Box Office held broadcasting rights to the fight in McGregor's native Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Although it was initially believed that the price would match that of the U.S. PPV, the price was set at ?24.95 (S19.95).[43] The fight was called for Sky Sports by Johnny Nelson and Carl Froch, joined by British MMA fighter and UFC analyst Dan Hardy.[44] British radio rights were held by the BBC, with Mike Costello and Steve Bunce on commentary for BBC Radio 5 Live.[45]\\r\\nIn Hispanic America, the fight aired on Fox Premium Action.[46] In Brazil, the event aired on Globosat-owned Combate.[47]\\r\\nAs with Mayweather vs. Pacquiao, it was expected that many viewers would seek unauthorized streams of the fight due to the high cost of the PPV. Showtime successfully received a preliminary injunction against the registrant of a group of 44 websites who planned to illegally stream the fight in violation of its copyrights, and all parties in active concert or participation with them.[48][49]\\r\\nIt was estimated that nearly 2.93 million viewers illegally streamed the fight, on video streaming websites and social media channels such as Facebook, YouTube and Periscope.[50][51]\\r\\nMayweather was expected to earn at least $100 million, increasing up to four times that amount upon the event achieving all its metrics.[52] McGregor was expected to earn $75 million, but both men signed NDAs barring them from publicly communicating the financial details.[53] According to the Nevada State Athletic Commission, Mayweather would earn a guaranteed purse of $100 million and McGregor was guaranteed $30 million.[54]\\r\\nOn August 23, 2017, the WBC unveiled a special belt that would go to the winner of the fight, the \\"Money Belt\\"; it is made from Italian-made alligator leather and encrusted with 3.3 pounds (1.5 kg) of 24-karat gold, 3,360 diamonds, 600 sapphires, and 300 emeralds.[55]\\r\\nOn August 16, 2017, the officials were named for the fight:[56]\\r\\nBoth athletes initially agreed to box in 10-ounce (285 g) gloves per Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) rules which require 10-ounce (285 g) gloves for boxing matches contracted over 147 pounds [67?kg] (the fight is contracted at 154 pounds [70?kg]).[57] McGregor wanted 8-ounce (225 g) gloves and Mayweather agreed, and both athletes submitted formal requests to box in 8-ounce (225 g) gloves, which was granted by the NSAC.[57]\\r\\nExperts expected that more money would be bet on the fight than any other boxing match in history; estimates ranged up to $85 million in bets.[58][59] There were six separate $1 million bets on Mayweather in Las Vegas bookmakers, but a large majority of bets overall were on the underdog, McGregor.[59]\\r\\nNevada State Athletic Commission announced the live gate for the event was $55,414,865.79 from 13,094 tickets sold and 137 complimentary tickets given out. This was far less than the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight which grossed $72 million from a paid attendance of 16,219 in 2015, despite claims from Ellerbe and Mayweather that it did more than $80 million.[60]\\r\\nSky Sports announced the fight garnered over a million PPV buys in the UK and grossed in excess of S20 million, surpassing the record set in April 2017 when Anthony Joshua defeated Wladimir Klitschko in front of 90,000 at the Wembley Stadium. This also meant the fight generated more buys in the UK than Mayweather-Pacquiao which took place in 2015.[61]\\r\\nAt the weigh-in, Mayweather tipped the scales at 149.5 lbs, with McGregor at 153 lbs.[62] Mayweather and McGregor entered the ring following the Irish and American national anthems; the Irish singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Imelda May performed on behalf of Conor McGregor,[63] followed by the American singer-songwriter and actress Demi Lovato, who was personally chosen by Mayweather.[64]\\r\\nMayweather was widely expected to dominate the fight early, but McGregor started strong and was ahead on the score cards for the first few rounds, due in part to Mayweather using the rope-a-dope technique liberally in the early stages.[65] As the fight progressed, McGregor weakened. In rounds 9 and 10, Mayweather landed a series of punches to McGregor's face, and referee Robert Byrd eventually called the fight in favor of Mayweather after McGregor was unable to defend himself due to fatigue.[66]\\r\\nAfter the match Mayweather stated that he had expected McGregor to be a fast starter, and had allowed him to deliver his heavy blows early.[67][68] McGregor on the other hand was disappointed by what he saw as an early stoppage, but respected the referee's decision. Former boxers such as George Foreman and Evander Holyfield expressed their impression regarding McGregor's boxing skills and the competitiveness of the fight,[69][70] with Foreman claiming that experts who criticized the fight \\"should apologize. It was competitive\\".[71] Mike Tyson gave McGregor an \\"A grade\\" for his performance, stating he was impressed.[72] The fight was lauded for its entertaining and exciting nature, especially when compared to Mayweather's most recent bouts.[73]\\r\\nMayweather announced in his post-fight interview that he had fought his final boxing match, and would retire from the sport. McGregor said in his post-fight interview that he would be willing to box again, and that he would return to mixed martial arts and the UFC.[citation needed]\\r\\nDavis failed to make weight during the August 25 weigh in, forcing the IBF to strip him of the title. The title was declared vacant, but would be still up for grabs if Fonseca secures victory.[74] Davis would go on to win by KO in the eighth round.

Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist.[8] Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller.\\r\\nThe band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was their first album to reach number one in the United States. Drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and replaced by ex-A II Z drummer Simon Wright, who left to join Dio in 1989. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip, released in 2000, was well received by critics. The band's studio album Black Ice, released in 2008, was the second highest-selling album of that year, and their biggest chart hit since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide.[9] The band's line-up remained the same until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement due to early-onset dementia and Rudd's legal troubles. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring on account of worsening hearing loss, and Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose stepped in as the band's vocalist for the remainder of that year's dates. Long-term bass player and background vocalist Cliff Williams retired from the band at the end of their 2016 Rock or Bust world tour.\\r\\nAC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 71.5 million albums in the United States, adding them to the list of highest-certified music artists in the United States and the list of best-selling music artists.[10][11][12] Back in Black has sold an estimated 50?million units worldwide, making it the second-highest-selling album by any artist ÿ and the highest-selling album by any band.

A TV advertisement at the same time offered assisted travel for families for a different life in Australia.[20] 15 members of the Young family left Scotland by aeroplane in late June 1963. Before moving into a house at 4 Burleigh Street in the suburb of Burwood they initially stayed at Villawood Migrant Hostel (a site later developed as Villawood Immigration Detention Centre) in Nissen huts, where George Young met and became friends with another migrant, Harry Vanda.[20]\\r\\nGeorge was the first to learn to play the guitar. He became a member of the Easybeats, one of Australia's most successful bands of the 1960s. In 1966, they became the first local rock act to have an international hit, with the song \\"Friday on My Mind\\".[21] Malcolm followed in George's footsteps by playing with a Newcastle, New South Wales, band called the Velvet Underground (not to be confused with the New York-based Velvet Underground).[22] Their older brother Alex Young chose to remain in Britain to pursue musical interests. In 1967, Alexander formed and played bass in the London-based band Grapefruitinitially called \\"The Grapefruit\\"with three former members of Tony Rivers and the Castaways, John Perry, Geoff Swettenham, and Pete Swettenham.\\r\\nMalcolm and Angus Young developed the idea for the band's name after their sister, Margaret Young, saw the initials \\"AC/DC\\" on a sewing machine. \\"AC/DC\\" is an abbreviation meaning \\"alternating current/direct current\\" electricity. The brothers felt that this name symbolised the band's raw energy, power-driven performances of their music.[23][24] \\"AC/DC\\" is pronounced one letter at a time, though the band are colloquially known as \\"Acca Dacca\\" in Australia.[25][26] The AC/DC band name is stylised with a high voltage sign separating the \\"AC\\" and \\"DC\\" and has been used on all studio albums, with the exception of the international version of Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.[27]\\r\\nIn November 1973, Malcolm and Angus Young formed AC/DC and recruited bassist Larry Van Kriedt, vocalist Dave Evans, and Colin Burgess, ex-Masters Apprentices drummer.[28] Pushing hard for the band's success were Australia's legendary roadie Ray Arnold and his partner Alan Kissack. Gene Pierson booked the band to play at Chequers nightclub on New Year's Eve, 1973.[29]\\r\\nBy this time, Angus Young had adopted his characteristic school-uniform stage outfit. The idea was his sister Margaret's. Angus had tried other costumes: Spider-Man, Zorro, a gorilla, and a parody of Superman, named Super-Ang.[22] In its early days, most members of the band dressed in some form of glam or satin outfit.\\r\\nOn stage, Evans was occasionally replaced by the band's first manager, Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with Sherbet prior to Daryl Braithwaite. In Paul Stenning's book, AC/DC: Two Sides To Every Glory, it is stated that Evans did not get along with Laughlin, which also contributed to the band's ill feeling toward Evans.[30] By the middle of 1974, the band had built up a strong live reputation which led to a support slot for the visiting Lou Reed.\\r\\nSome time in 1974, on the recommendation of Michael Chugg, veteran Melbourne promoter Michael Browning booked the band to play at his club, the Hard Rock. Browning had previously managed Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, unsuccessfully trying to break them into the UK market. He did not like their glam rock image and felt that Evans was the wrong singer for the band, but was impressed by the Young brothers' guitar playing. Shortly afterwards, he received a call from the band; Laughlin had quit as manager, and they were stuck in Adelaide with no money. Browning agreed to bail them out and booked them for another gig at the Hard Rock. Following the gig, they agreed to take him on as their new manager, with the co-operation of their older brother George and Harry Vanda.[31]\\r\\nThe Young brothers decided to abandon the glam rock image which had already been adopted by Melbourne band The Skyhooks and pursue a harder blues-rock sound. To this end they agreed that Evans was not a suitable frontman for the group.[30] Around this time, they also moved their base to Melbourne, where they frequently played at the Hard Rock.\\r\\nIn September 1974, Ronald Belford \\"Bon\\" Scott, an experienced vocalist and friend of George Young, replaced Dave Evans[32] after friend Vince Lovegrove recommended him to George Young.[8] Scott's appointment coincided with him working as a chauffeur for the band at the time until an audition promoted him to lead singer.[33] Like the Young brothers, Scott was born in Scotland and emigrated to Australia in his childhood. The band had recorded only one single with Evans, \\"Can I Sit Next To You, Girl\\" / \\"Rockin' in the Parlour\\"; eventually, the song was re-written and re-recorded with Bon Scott as \\"Can I Sit Next to You Girl\\" [Track 7 on the Australian album TNT (1975), and Track 6 on the international release of High Voltage (1976)].\\r\\nBy October 1974, the Australia-only album High Voltage had been recorded. It took only ten days[34] and was based on instrumental songs written by the Young brothers, with lyrics added by Scott. Within a few months, the band's line-up had stabilised, featuring Scott, the Young brothers, bassist Mark Evans, and drummer Phil Rudd. Later that year they released the single \\"It's a Long Way to the Top\\", for which a well-known promotional video was made for the program Countdown, featuring the band miming the song on the back of a flatbed truck. The song is regarded as their perennial rock anthem.[35] It was included on their second album, T.N.T. (1975), which was also released only in Australia and New Zealand. T.N.T. featured the song \\"High Voltage\\", which was the first song written and recorded for the album. Because \\"High Voltage\\" was released as a single before T.N.T. was released, some people thought it was the title track to AC/DC's debut album.\\r\\nAC/DC were scheduled to play at the 1975 Sunbury music festival; however, they went home without performing following an altercation with the management of headlining act Deep Purple.[36]\\r\\nBetween 1974 and 1977, aided by regular appearances on Molly Meldrum's Countdown, the ABC's nationally broadcast pop-music television show, AC/DC became one of the most popular and successful acts in Australia. Their performance on 3 April 1977 was their last live TV appearance for more than 20 years.[34]\\r\\nBrowning sent promo material to contacts in London, which came to the attention of Phil Carson of Atlantic Records. In 1976, the band signed an international deal with Atlantic Records. On arrival in London, their scheduled tour with Back Street Crawler was cancelled following the death of Paul Kossoff. As a result, they went back to playing smaller venues to build a local following until their label organized the \\"Lock Up Your Daughters\\" tour sponsored by Sounds magazine, the only major music magazine which was still relatively receptive to traditional rock music. At the time, punk rock was breaking out in London and came to dominate the pages of the major music weeklies, NME and Melody Maker. AC/DC were sometimes identified with the punk rock movement by the British press, however, in reality,they hated punk rock, believing it to be a passing fad ÿ according to manager Michael Browning \\"it wasn't possible to even hold a conversation with AC/DC about punk without them getting totally pissed off\\".[31] Their reputation, however, managed to survive the punk upheavals of the late 1970s, and they maintained a cult following in the UK throughout this time.[7] Angus Young gained notoriety for mooning the audience during live performances.\\r\\nThe first AC/DC album to gain worldwide distribution was a 1976 compilation of tracks taken from the High Voltage and T.N.T. LPs. Also titled High Voltage, and released on the Atlantic Records label, the album has to date sold three million copies worldwide.[37][38] The track selection was heavily weighted toward the more recent T.N.T., and included only two songs from their first LP. The band's next album, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, was released in the same year in both Australian and international versions, like its predecessor. Track listings varied worldwide, and the international version of the album also featured the T.N.T. track \\"Rocker\\", which had previously never been released internationally. The original Australian version included \\"Jailbreak\\" (now more readily available on the 1984 compilation EP '74 Jailbreak or as a live version on the 1992 Live album). Dirty Deeds was not released in the US until 1981, by which time the band were at the peak of their popularity.\\r\\nAfter a brief tour of Sweden, they returned to London where they set new attendance records during their residency at the Marquee. However, their appearance at the 1976 Reading Festival failed to get a response from the crowd. They toured extensively throughout Europe, then returned to tour Australia in late 1976 to rebuild their finances and record the Let There Be Rock album.\\r\\nIn early 1977 they returned to Britain and began a European tour with Black Sabbath. While Bon Scott and Ozzy Osbourne quickly became friends, relations were less than cordial between the other members of the respective bands. In one incident, Geezer Butler pulled a knife on Malcolm Young.[39] Later in the year they toured with Rainbow.\\r\\nTowards the end of 1977, bassist Mark Evans was fired; purportedly to find someone who could sing backup vocals.[8] Evans described disagreement with Angus and Malcolm as a contributing factor.[8] He was replaced by Cliff Williams.[8] Neither of the Young brothers has elaborated on the departure of Evans, though Richard Griffiths, the CEO of Epic Records and a booking agent for AC/DC in the mid-1970s, later commented, \\"You knew Mark wasn't going to last, he was just too much of a nice guy.\\"[22] Mark Evans' autobiography, DIRTY DEEDS: My Life Inside/Outside of AC/DC, released in 2011, predominantly dealt with his time in AC/DC, including being fired.[40]\\r\\nAC/DC were a somewhat formative influence on new wave of British heavy metal bands who emerged in the late 1970s, such as Saxon and Iron Maiden, in part as a reaction to the decline of traditional early 1970s hard rock bands. In 2007, critics noted that AC/DC, along with Thin Lizzy, UFO, Scorpions, and Judas Priest, were among \\"the second generation of rising stars ready to step into the breach as the old guard waned.\\"[41]\\r\\nAC/DC's first American exposure was through the Michigan radio station AM 600 WTAC in 1977. The station's manager, Peter C. Cavanaugh, booked the band to play at Flint's Capitol Theater. The supporting act was MC5, who had just briefly reunited and agreed to play at the event. The band opened with their popular song \\"Live Wire\\" and closed with \\"It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\\".[42] They gained invaluable experience of the stadium circuit, supporting leading rock acts such as Aerosmith, Kiss, Styx, UFO, and Blue ?yster Cult, and co-headlined with Cheap Trick.[34]\\r\\nThe 1978 release of Powerage marked the debut of bassist Cliff Williams, and with its harder riffs, followed the blueprint set by Let There Be Rock.[43] Only one single was released from Powerage, \\"Rock 'n' Roll Damnation/Sin City\\". An appearance at the Apollo Theatre, Glasgow during the Powerage tour was recorded and released as If You Want Blood You've Got It, featuring such songs as \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\", \\"Problem Child\\", and \\"Let There Be Rock\\", as well as lesser-known album tracks like \\"Riff Raff\\". Powerage was the last album produced by Harry Vanda and George Young that had lead vocals by Bon Scott, and is claimed to be AC/DC's most under-rated album.[44]\\r\\nThe major breakthrough in the band's career came in their collaboration with producer \\"Mutt\\" Lange on the album Highway to Hell, released in 1979. Eddie Van Halen notes this to be his favourite AC/DC record, along with Powerage.[45] It became the first AC/DC LP to break into the US top 100, eventually reaching No.?17,[34] and it propelled AC/DC into the top ranks of hard rock acts.[7] Highway to Hell had lyrics that shifted away from flippant and comical toward more central rock themes, putting increased emphasis on backing vocals but still featured AC/DC's signature sound: loud, simple, pounding riffs and grooving backbeats.[46] The final track, \\"Night Prowler\\", has two breaths in quick succession at the start of the song, intended to create a tone of fear and loathing.[7]\\r\\nAs 1980 began, the band began work on a new album that would eventually become Back in Black, but Bon Scott would not live to see it finished. On 19 February 1980, Scott passed out in the car on the way back to friend Alistair Kinnear's house after a night of heavy drinking at the Music Machine club in London. Upon arrival at his home, Kinnear was unable to move Scott from the car into his home for the night, so he left him in the car overnight to sleep off the effects of the alcohol. Unable to wake Scott late the next morning, Kinnear rushed him to King's College Hospital in Camberwell, where Scott was pronounced dead on arrival. Pulmonary aspiration of vomit was the cause of Scott's death,[47] and the official cause was listed as \\"acute alcohol poisoning\\".[48] Scott's family buried him in Fremantle, Western Australia, the area they emigrated to when he was a boy.[49]\\r\\nInconsistencies in the official accounts of Scott's death have been cited in conspiracy theories, which suggest that Scott died of a heroin overdose, or was killed by exhaust fumes redirected into the car, or that Kinnear did not exist.[48] Additionally, Scott was asthmatic,[50] and the temperature was below freezing on the morning of his death.\\r\\nFollowing Scott's death the band briefly considered quitting, but encouraged by the insistence from Scott's parents that he would have wanted them to go on, they eventually decided to continue and went about finding a new frontman.[8] Various candidates were considered for his replacement, including: Buzz Shearman, ex-Moxy member, who was not able to join because of voice problems,[51] ex-Back Street Crawler vocalist Terry Slesser and then Slade vocalist, Noddy Holder.[52] The remaining AC/DC members finally decided on ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson.\\r\\nAngus Young later recalled, \\"I remember the first time I had ever heard Brian's (Johnson) name was from Bon. Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see if we can find him.\\"[53]\\r\\nFor the audition, Johnson sang \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" from Let There Be Rock and Ike & Tina Turner's \\"Nutbush City Limits\\".[24] He was hired a few days after the audition. With Johnson the band completed the songwriting that they had begun with Scott for the album Back in Black. Recording took place at Compass Point Studios in The Bahamas a few months after Scott's death. Back in Black, produced by Mutt Lange and recorded by Tony Platt, became their biggest-selling album and a hard-rock landmark; hits include \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" and the title track. The album reached No.1 in the UK and No.4 in the US, where it spent 131 weeks on the Billboard 200 album chart.[34]\\r\\nThe follow-up album, 1981's For Those About to Rock We Salute You, also sold well and was positively received by critics. The album featured two of the band's most popular singles: \\"Let's Get It Up\\"[54] and the title track, \\"For Those About to Rock\\", which reached No.13 and No.15 in the UK, respectively. The band split with Lange for their self-produced 1983 album, Flick of the Switch, in an effort to recover the rawness and simplicity of their early albums.[55]\\r\\nAfter having problems with drugs and alcohol,[57] drummer Phil Rudd's friendship with Malcolm Young deteriorated and eventually escalated to a physical confrontation after which Rudd was fired.[24] Former Procol Harum drummer B.J. Wilson was drafted in to help complete the recordings, but his drum parts were eventually not used, as Rudd had already completed his drum parts.[58] Rudd was replaced by Simon Wright in the summer of 1983 after the band held over 700 auditions in the US and UK.[59] Simon Kirke of Free and Bad Company fame, and Paul Thompson of Roxy Music were two of the drummers auditioned.[60]\\r\\nLater in the year, AC/DC released the self-produced album Flick of the Switch, which was less successful than their previous albums, and was considered underdeveloped and unmemorable.[55] One critic stated that the band \\"had made the same album nine times\\".[61] AC/DC were voted the eighth-biggest disappointment of the year in the 1984 Kerrang! readers' poll. However, Flick of the Switch eventually reached No.4 on the UK charts,[24] and AC/DC had minor success with the singles \\"Nervous Shakedown\\" and \\"Flick of the Switch\\". Fly on the Wall, produced by the Young brothers in 1985, was also regarded as uninspired and directionless.[62] A music concept video of the same name featured the band at a bar, playing five of the album's ten songs.\\r\\nIn 1986, the group returned to the charts with the made-for-radio \\"Who Made Who\\". The album Who Made Who was the soundtrack to Stephen King's film Maximum Overdrive;[44] it brought together older hits, such as \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" and \\"Ride On\\", with newer songs such as title track \\"Who Made Who\\", and two new instrumentals, \\"D.T.\\" and \\"Chase the Ace\\".\\r\\nIn February 1988, AC/DC were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association's Hall of Fame.[63]\\r\\nAC/DC's 1988 album, Blow Up Your Video, was recorded at Studio Miraval in Le Val, France, and reunited the band with their original producers, Harry Vanda and George Young. The group recorded nineteen songs, choosing ten for the final release; though the album was later criticised for containing excessive \\"filler\\",[64] it was a commercial success. Blow Up Your Video sold more copies than the previous two studio releases combined, reaching No.2 on the UK chartsAC/DC's highest position since \\"Back in Black\\" in 1980. The album featured the UK top-twenty single \\"Heatseeker\\"[54] and popular songs such as \\"That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll\\". The Blow Up Your Video World Tour began in February 1988, in Perth, Australia. That April, following live appearances across Europe, Malcolm Young announced that he was taking time off from touring, principally to begin recovery from his alcoholism. Another member of the Young family, Stevie Young, temporarily took Malcolm's place.\\r\\nFollowing the tour, Wright left the group to work on the upcoming Dio album Lock Up the Wolves, and was replaced by session veteran Chris Slade. Johnson was unavailable for several months while finalising his divorce,[24] so the Young brothers wrote all the songs for the next album, a practice they continued for all subsequent releases through Rock or Bust in 2014.\\r\\nThe next album, The Razors Edge, was recorded in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and was mixed and engineered by Mike Fraser and produced by Bruce Fairbairn, who had previously worked with Aerosmith and Bon Jovi. Released in 1990, it was a major comeback for the band, and included the hits \\"Thunderstruck\\" and \\"Are You Ready\\", which reached No.5 and No.16 respectively on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart, and \\"Moneytalks\\", which peaked at No.23 on the Billboard Hot 100.[54] The album went multi-platinum and reached the US top ten. Several shows on the Razors Edge tour were recorded for the 1992 live album, titled Live. Live was produced by Fairbairn, and is considered one of the best live albums of the 1990s.[65] AC/DC headlined the Monsters of Rock show during this tour, which was released on DVD as Live at Donington. During The Razors Edge tour three fans were killed at a concert at the Salt Palace in Salt Lake City, Utah in January 1991. When the concert began fans rushed the stage crushing the three and injuring others. It took 20 minutes before venue security and the group understood the severity of the situation and stopped the concert. AC/DC settled with the victims' families out of court. As a result of this incident, the Salt Palace eliminated festival seating from future events.[66][67] A year later, AC/DC recorded \\"Big Gun\\" for the soundtrack of the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie Last Action Hero, and was released as a single, reaching No.1 on the US Mainstream Rock chart, the band's first No.1 single on that chart.[34]\\r\\nIn 1994, Angus and Malcolm invited Rudd to several jam sessions. He was eventually rehired to replace Slade, whose amicable departure arose in part because of the band's strong desire to again work with Rudd. Recorded at the Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles by the reunited 1980ÿ83 line-up and produced by Rick Rubin, Ballbreaker was released in 1995. The first single from the album was \\"Hard as a Rock\\". Two more singles were released from the album: \\"Hail Caesar\\" and \\"Cover You in Oil\\".\\r\\nIn 1997, a box set named Bonfire was released. It contained four albums; a remastered version of Back in Black; Volts (a disc with alternate takes, outtakes, and stray live cuts) and two live albums, Live from the Atlantic Studios and Let There Be Rock: The Movie. Live from the Atlantic Studios was recorded on 7 December 1977 at the Atlantic Studios in New York. Let There Be Rock: The Movie was a double album recorded in 1979 at the Pavillon de Paris and was the soundtrack of a motion picture, AC/DC: Let There Be Rock. The US version of the box set included a colour booklet, a two-sided poster, a sticker, a temporary tattoo, a keychain bottle opener, and a guitar pick.[68]\\r\\nIn 2000, the band released Stiff Upper Lip, produced by brother George Young at the Warehouse Studio, again in Vancouver. The album was better received by critics than Ballbreaker but was considered lacking in new ideas.[69][70] The Australian release included a bonus disc with three promotional videos and several live performances recorded in Madrid, Spain in 1996. Stiff Upper Lip reached No.1 in five countries, including Argentina and Germany; No.2 in three countries, Spain, France and Switzerland; No.3 in Australia; No.5 in Canada and Portugal; and No.7 in Norway, the US and Hungary. The first single, \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\", remained at No.1 on the US Mainstream Rock charts for four weeks.[34] The other singles released also did very well; \\"Satellite Blues\\" and \\"Safe in New York City\\" reached No.7 and No.31 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks, respectively.\\r\\nIn 2002, AC/DC signed a long-term, multi-album deal with Sony Music,[71] who went on to release a series of remastered albums as part of their AC/DC remasters series. Each release contained an expanded booklet featuring rare photographs, memorabilia, and notes.[72] In 2003, the entire back-catalogue (except Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip) was remastered and re-released. Ballbreaker was eventually re-released in October 2005; Stiff Upper Lip was later re-released in April 2007. Also in 2003, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\\r\\nOn 30 July 2003, the band performed with the Rolling Stones and Rush at Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto. The concert, held before an audience of half a million, was intended to help the city overcome the negative publicity stemming from the effects of a 2003 SARS epidemic. The concert holds the record for the largest paid music event in North American history.[73] The band came second in a list of Australia's highest-earning entertainers for 2005,[74] and sixth for 2006,[75] despite having neither toured since 2003 nor released an album since 2000. Verizon Wireless has gained the rights to release AC/DC's full albums and the entire Live at Donington concert to download in 2008.[76]\\r\\nOn 16 October 2007, Columbia Records released a double and triple DVD titled Plug Me In. The set consists of five and seven hours of rare footage, and even a recording of AC/DC at a high school performing \\"School Days\\", \\"TNT\\", \\"She's Got Balls\\", and \\"It's a Long Way to the Top\\". As with Family Jewels, disc one contains rare shows of the band with Bon Scott, and disc two is about the Brian Johnson era. The collector's edition contains an extra DVD with 21 more rare performances of both Scott and Johnson and more interviews.[77]\\r\\nAC/DC made their video game debut on Rock Band 2, with \\"Let There Be Rock\\" included as a playable track.[78] The setlist from their Live at Donington live album was released as playable songs for the Rock Band series by means of a Wal-Mart-exclusive retail disc titled AC/DC Live: Rock Band Track Pack.[79]\\r\\nNo Bull: The Directors Cut, a newly edited, comprehensive Blu-ray and DVD of the band's July 1996 Plaza De Toros de las Ventas concert in Madrid, Spain, was released on 9 September 2008.[80]\\r\\nOn 18 August 2008, Columbia Records announced 18 October Australian release, and 20 October worldwide release, of the studio album Black Ice. The 15-track album was the band's first studio release in eight years, was produced by Brendan O'Brien and was mixed and engineered by Mike Fraser. Like Stiff Upper Lip, it was recorded at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia. Black Ice was sold in the US exclusively at Walmart and Sam's Club and the band's official website.[83]\\r\\n\\"Rock 'n' Roll Train\\", the album's first single, was released to radio on 28 August. On 15 August, AC/DC recorded a video for a song from the new album in London with a special selection of fans getting the chance to be in the video.[84] Black Ice debuted at No.1 on album charts in 29 countries and also was Columbia Records' biggest debut album (since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales data for Billboard in March 1991). Black Ice has been certified Multi Platinum in eight countries, including the US, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Germany and the Czech Republic. Additionally Black Ice has achieved Platinum status in twelve countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, UK, Argentina, Singapore and New Zealand) and Gold status in four countries (The Netherlands, Spain, Poland and Brazil). The 18-month Black Ice World Tour supporting the new album was announced on 11 September and began on 28 October in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.[85]\\r\\nOn 15 September 2008, AC/DC Radio debuted on Sirius Channel 19 and XM channel 53. The channel plays AC/DC music along with interviews with the band members.[86]\\r\\nWith the North American release of Black Ice on 20 October 2008, Columbia Records and Walmart created \\"Rock Again AC/DC Stores\\" to promote the album. In October 2008, MTV, Walmart, and Columbia created \\"AC/DC Rock Band Stores\\" in New York City, at Times Square, and in Los Angeles. \\"Black Ice\\" trucks were also dispatched on the streets of these two cities after the release, playing AC/DC music aloud and making various stops each day to sell merchandise.[87]\\r\\nIn late September 2009, the band rescheduled six shows when Brian Johnson underwent an operation for ulcers.[88] On 29 September, the band announced a collection of studio and live rarities, Backtracks, which was released on 10 November 2009 as a 3-CD/2-DVD/1-LP box-set.[89]\\r\\nOn 4 November AC/DC were announced as the Business Review Weekly top Australian earner (entertainment) for 2009 with earnings of $105?million. This displaced The Wiggles from the number one spot for the first time in four years.[90]\\r\\nOn 19 April 2010, AC/DC released Iron Man 2, the soundtrack for the eponymous film which compiled earlier tracks from the band's studio albums.[91] One month later, the band headlined Download Festival at Donington Park,[92] and closed the Black Ice World Tour in Bilbao, Spain on 28 June 2010, after 20 months in which AC/DC went to 108 cities in over 28 countries, with an estimated audience of over five million people.[93] Three concerts in December 2009 at the River Plate Stadium in Argentina were released as the DVD Live at River Plate on 10 May 2011.[94] An exclusive single from the DVD, featuring the songs \\"Shoot to Thrill\\" and \\"War Machine\\", was issued on Record Store Day.[95] In 2011, the band also issued on DVD and Blu-ray the concert movie AC/DC: Let There Be Rock, which had its theatrical release in 1980.[96]\\r\\nAngus stated in an interview in early May 2011 that the band was beginning to plan another world tour, saying, \\"Now we're thinking, 'How can we ever better the 'Black Ice' world tour?' But we will.\\"[97] At the band's Live at River Plate DVD premiere on 6 May 2011 at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, England, Angus said that there were plans for the group to release a new studio album \\"within the next couple of years\\", which the tour would support.[98]\\r\\nIn May 2012, Malcolm Young confirmed that the band were working on a potential follow-up to 2008's Black Ice. But he warned that fans were in for a longer wait than expected, after lead singer Brian Johnson suggested there would be new material the next year. Malcolm stated, \\"You know what Brian's like. He just says things and then walks away. It'll be a little while?ÿ a year or two anyway. I've been doing some jamming on some song ideas but I do that all the time, as do the rest of the band. We are still working. But we had a long rest between Stiff Upper Lip and Black Ice, so I think we need a couple of years to recuperate and work on it a bit more.\\"[99]\\r\\nOn 19 November 2012, AC/DC released Live at River Plate,[100] their first live album in 20 years.\\r\\nOn 16 April 2014, in response to earlier reports that the band may be retiring due to Malcolm Young being seriously ill and unable to perform,[101] Brian Johnson commented that AC/DC are not retiring, stating \\"We are definitely getting together in May in Vancouver. We're going to pick up guitars, have a plonk and see if anybody has got any tunes or ideas. If anything happens we'll record it.\\"[102] AC/DC subsequently announced in an official statement on their Facebook page that Malcolm Young would be taking a break from the band due to his ill health. It ended: \\"The band will continue to make music.\\"[103] In June, Johnson announced that AC/DC are \\"very likely\\" to be on the road again before the end of 2014.[104] In July 2014, AC/DC confirmed that they had finished recording their next album and that Malcolm's nephew, Stevie Young replaced Malcolm in the studio.[105] Drummer Phil Rudd released his first solo album, Head Job, on 29 August 2014. He confirmed that there would be another AC/DC tour, and stated that the band had no intention of retiring, adding, \\"We'll all have to be dead before it stops.\\"[106] Malcolm died on 18 November 2017 at the age of 64.[107]\\r\\nOn 23 September 2014, Alberts management confirmed that founder member Malcolm Young had officially departed from the band and revealed that their new record entitled Rock or Bust featuring eleven new tracks would be released on 28 November 2014 as the first AC/DC album in the band's history without Malcolm Young on the recordings.[1] The band also announced plans for a world tour to promote the new album with Malcolm and Angus' nephew Stevie Young as Malcolm's replacement.[108]\\r\\nOn 6 November 2014 Rudd was charged with attempting to procure a murder, threatening to kill, possession of methamphetamine, and possession of cannabis, following a police raid on his home.[109][110] The charge of attempting to procure a murder was withdrawn the following day, but the other charges remained.[111] AC/DC released a statement clarifying that the tour promoting Rock or Bust would continue, but did not say whether or not Rudd would participate, or if he was still a member of the band.[112]\\r\\nIn an interview on 13 November, Angus Young stated that the band had experienced problems with Rudd earlier in the year when recording Rock or Bust, and that his situation had taken the band by surprise. Rudd had also missed video and photo shoots, and with reference to Rudd's future in the band, Young added, \\"So, at this stage, it's a pretty tough call for us.\\"[113] He also said the band would continue: \\"He's got to sort himself out I think?... At this point it's kind of a question mark. But if we're touring, there will be a drummer in place, put it that way.\\"[114]\\r\\nAt the charity signing before the Grammy Awards, the band was photographed together with former drummer Chris Slade. It was later confirmed that he had rejoined the band for the Grammys and upcoming tour.[115] In April 2015, Rudd pleaded guilty to drug charges and threatening to kill a former assistant.[116] Shortly thereafter, the band's web site removed Rudd as the band's drummer and replaced him with Slade.[117] On 9 July 2015 Rudd was denied a discharge without conviction and sentenced to eight months' home detention.[118]\\r\\nOn 7 March 2016, the band announced that the final ten dates of the Rock or Bust World Tour would be rescheduled as Johnson's doctors had ordered him to stop touring immediately, as his hearing loss had accelerated and he risked complete deafness if he persisted on the road. The ten cancelled dates would be performed \\"likely with a guest vocalist\\" later in the year, leaving Johnson's future in touring with the group uncertain.[119] Johnson himself later stated on The Howard Stern Show that his hearing loss didn't come from having performed for 36 years with AC/DC, but rather his love of auto racing and having forgotten to put in ear plugs during one race that left him with a ruptured ear drum in his left ear.[120]\\r\\nHowever, on 15 March 2016, American comedian Jim Breuer (a friend of Johnson) revealed on his podcast that Johnson had received a second opinion on his hearing and it was not as bad as initially thought. Nonetheless, Breuer mentioned that Johnson told him that he was essentially fired from AC/DC and that he hadn't heard from the band since the announcement of the tour being postponed, adding that Angus Young wants to continue the band for at least another ten years and do at least one more studio album and world tour.[121] Breuer later clarified his comments on Facebook that did not end speculation on Johnson's future with the band.[122]\\r\\nOn 19 April 2016, Johnson made an official statement regarding his health problems and inability to tour. In the statement, he acknowledged his ongoing hearing difficulties but stated his intentions to continue recording and potentially resume touring if his health improves sufficiently. He also specifically thanked Angus Young and Cliff Williams for their support during his AC/DC tenure.[123]\\r\\nOn 16 April 2016, AC/DC released a statement announcing the addition of Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose as the band's lead vocalist for the remainder of their 2016 tour dates. The statement reads: \\"AC/DC band members would like to thank Brian Johnson for his contributions and dedication to the band throughout the years. We wish him all the best with his hearing issues and future ventures. As much as we want this tour to end as it started, we understand, respect and support Brian's decision to stop touring and save his hearing. We are dedicated to fulfilling the remainder of our touring commitments to everyone that has supported us over the years, and are fortunate that Axl Rose has kindly offered his support to help us fulfill this commitment. AC/DC will resume their Rock or Bust World Tour with Axl Rose joining on vocals.\\"[124][125]\\r\\nOn 8 July 2016, Cliff Williams indicated he was retiring from the band in an interview with Gulfshore Life, saying \\"It's been what Ive known for the past 40 years, but after this tour Im backing off of touring and recording. Losing Malcolm, the thing with Phil and now with Brian, it's a changed animal. I feel in my gut it's the right thing.\\"[126] At the end of the Rock or Bust Tour he released a video statement confirming his retirement.[127]\\r\\nFollowing the band's final show with Williams on 21 September 2016 in Philadelphia it was reported that Axl Rose would be joining the band full-time and that he and Angus would continue AC/DC with different musicians.[128][129] Young's friend Angry Anderson said in a 2018 interview that Young intended to make a new album with Rose.[130]\\r\\nAC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 10 March 2003.[131] During the ceremony the band performed \\"Highway to Hell\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", with guest vocals provided by host Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. He described the band's power chords as \\"the thunder from down under that gives you the second most powerful surge that can flow through your body.\\"[132] During the acceptance speech, Brian Johnson quoted their 1977 song \\"Let There Be Rock\\".[133]\\r\\nOn 22 March 2000, the municipality of Legans (near Madrid) named a street in honour of the band as \\"Calle de AC/DC\\" (\\"AC/DC Street\\"). Malcolm and Angus attended the inauguration with many fans. Later that day, the plaque with the name of the group was stolen, perhaps by an enthusiast or collector. The plaque was replaced two hours later, and stolen once again a mere three days after the fact. The plaque had since been stolen numerous times, forcing the municipality of Legans to begin selling replicas of the official street plaque.\\r\\nIn May 2003, the Young brothers accepted a Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Service to Australian Music at the 2003 Music Winners Awards, during which Malcolm paid special tribute to Bon Scott, who was also a recipient of the award.[134]\\r\\nOn 1 October 2004, a central Melbourne thoroughfare, Corporation Lane, was renamed ACDC Lane in honour of the band. The City of Melbourne forbade the use of the slash character in street names, so the four letters were combined.[135] The lane is near Swanston Street where, on the back of a truck, the band recorded their video for the 1975 hit \\"It's a Long Way to the Top\\".[35]\\r\\nThey sold over 1.3?million CDs in the US during 2007 despite not having released a new album since 2000 at that point. Additionally, the group's commercial success continues to flourish despite their choice to refrain from selling albums in digital online formats for many years.[136] However, in November 2012, the entire catalogue (excluding the TNT album and the Australian versions of the High Voltage, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap and Let There Be Rock albums) became available on the iTunes Store.[137]\\r\\nIn 2009 the Recording Industry Association of America upgraded the group's US sales figures from 69?million to 71?million, making AC/DC the fifth-best-selling band in US history and the tenth-best-selling artist, selling more albums than Madonna and Mariah Carey.[10] The RIAA also certified Back in Black as double Diamond (20?million) in US sales, and by 2007 the album had sold 22?million copies, which made it the fifth-best-selling album of all-time in the US.[13]\\r\\nNote: Before their debut album, High Voltage (1975), AC/DC had several line up changes.

Part of the Canadian province of British Columbia, the islands were formerly and are still commonly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands[4]. They are separated from the mainland to the east by the Hecate Strait. Queen Charlotte Sound lies to the south, with Vancouver Island beyond. To the north, the disputed Dixon Entrance separates Haida Gwaii from the Alexander Archipelago in the U.S. state of Alaska. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe islands are the heartland of the Haida Nation. Haida people have lived on the islands for 13,000 years,[5] and currently make up approximately half of the population.[6] The Haida exercise their sovereignty over the islands through their acting government, the X?aaydaG?a Waadlux?an Naay, and have as recently as 2015 hosted First Nations delegations such as the Potlatch and subsequent treaty signing between the Haida and Heiltsuk.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe renaming of the archipelago occurred on June 3, 2010, when the Haida Gwaii Reconciliation Act officially renamed the islands Haida Gwaii as part of the Kunst'aa guu - Kunst'aayah Reconciliation Protocol[8] between British Columbia and the Haida people.[2][9][10]. Some Kaigani Haida also live on the traditionally Lingt Prince of Wales Island in Alaska.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaida Gwaii consists of two main islands: Graham or North Island (Haida kl: Kiis Gwaay) in the north and Moresby Island (T'aawxii X?aayda??a Gwaay.yaay lina??waay, literally: south people island half, or Gwaay Haanas \\"Islands of Beauty\\") in the south, along with approximately 150 smaller islands with a total landmass of 10,180?km2 (3,931?sq?mi). Other major islands include Anthony Island (?'waagaaw / S??ang Gwaay), Burnaby Island (S??aay Kun Gwaay.yaay), Alder Island (?'uuna Gwaay / Gwaay.yaay),[3] and Kunghit Island. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the islands are protected under federal legislation as Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site, which is mostly on Moresby Island and containing adjoining islands and islets. Also protected, but under provincial jurisdiction, are several provincial parks, the largest of which is Naikoon Provincial Park on northeastern Graham Island. The islands are home to an abundance of wildlife, including the largest subspecies of black bear (Ursus americanus carlottae) and also the smallest subspecies of stoat (Mustela erminea haidarum). Black-tailed deer and raccoon are introduced species that have become abundant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary transportation links between the Islands and mainland British Columbia are through the Sandspit Airport, the Masset Airport and the BC Ferries terminal at Skidegate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe westernmost leg of Highway 16 connects Masset and Skidegate on Graham Island, and Skidegate with Prince Rupert on the mainland via regular BC Ferries service by the MV Northern Adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also regular BC Ferries service between Skidegate and Alliford Bay on Moresby Island. Floatplane services connect to facilities such as the Alliford Bay Water Aerodrome and Masset Water Aerodrome.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economy is mixed, including art and natural resources, primarily logging and commercial fishing. Furthermore, service industries and government jobs provide about one-third of the jobs, and tourism has become a more prominent part of the economy in recent years, especially for fishing and tour guides, cycling, camping, and adventure tourism.  Aboriginal culture tourism has been enhanced with the establishment of the Haida Heritage Centre at Kaay Ilnygaay.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic education is provided through School District 50 Haida Gwaii, which operates elementary and secondary schools in Masset, Port Clements, Queen Charlotte, Sandspit, and Skidegate. Higher education programs are offered at the Haida Heritage Centre in partnership with the Northwest Community College, University of Northern British Columbia, and with the Haida Gwaii Higher Education Society.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublicly funded health services are provided by Northern Health, the regional health authority responsible for the northern half of the province.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe existing Queen Charlotte General Hospital was built in 1953 and opened in 1955. Its size is approximately 1670 square metres (18,000 square feet). In 2013, construction started on the same site for a $50 million, two-storey replacement hospital, approximately 5,000 square metres (54,000 square feet). Construction of the new Queen Charlotte/Haida Gwaii Hospital will be cost-shared by the province and the North West Regional Hospital District. It will open in 2015.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nHaida Gwaii has four British Columbia Ambulance Service stations, staffed by 36 part-time paramedics. The first full-time paramedic was hired after the controversial death in 2014 of Godfrey Williams, a Skidegate band councillor, who died from a heart attack after waiting for more than an hour for an ambulance to arrive from a station 10 minutes away. The issue resulted in a review of ambulance services for Haida Gwaii by BC Emergency Health Services.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of colonial contact, the population was roughly 30,000 people, residing in several towns and including slave populations drawn from other clans of Haida as well as from other nations. It is estimated that ninety percent of the population died during the 1800s from smallpox alone; other diseases arrived as well, including typhoid, measles, and syphilis, affecting many more inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1900, only 350 people remained. Towns were abandoned as people left their homes for the towns of Skidegate and Masset, for cannery towns on the mainland, or for Vancouver Island. Today, around 4,500[14] people live on the islands. About 70% of the indigenous people (Haida) live in two communities at Skidegate and Old Massett, with a population of about 700 each. In total the Haida make up 45% of the population of the islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnthony Island and the island of Ninstints were made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006; in the decision, the decline in population wrought by disease was referenced when citing the 'vanished civilization' of the Haida.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nHaida Gwaii is considered by archaeologists as an option for a Pacific coastal route taken by the first humans migrating to the Americas from the Bering Strait.[16] At this time Haida Gwaii was likely not an island, but connected to Vancouver Island and the mainland via the now submerged continental shelf.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is unclear how people arrived on Haida Gwaii, but archaeological sites have established human habitation on the islands as far back as 13,000 years ago.[19] Populations that formerly inhabited Beringia expanded into northern North America after the Last Glacial Maximum, and gave rise to Eskimo-Aleuts and Na-Den Indians.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderwater archaeologists from the University of Victoria are seeking to confirm that stone structures discovered in 2014 on the seabed of Hecate Strait may date back 13,700 or more years ago and be the earliest known signs of human habitation in Canada.[16] Coastal sites of this era are now deep underwater.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Settlement of the Americas coastal migration hypothesis suggests that the first North Americans may have been here as the oldest human remains known from Alaska or Canada are from On Your Knees Cave. Anthropologists have found striking parallels between the myths, rituals, and dwelling types of the Koryaksinhabitants of the Kamchatka Peninsulaand those of the Native peoples of America's Northwest Coast. At this time the island was twice as large as today. There is strong genetic evidence for these early people having an origin there.[22][23] The Koryaks were a matrilinear seafaring people hunting whales and other marine mammals.[24] Their god was Kujkynnjaku, the Raven.[25][26] Most of the Raven myths are similar to those of the Koryak.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group of people inhabiting these Islands developed a culture made rich by the abundance of the land and sea. These people became the Haida.  The Haida were a matriarchal society ÿ the women made the decisions prior to European discovery.[citation needed] The Haida are a linguistically distinct group, and they have a complex class and rank system consisting of two main clans: Eagles and Ravens.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinks and diversity within the Haida Nation was gained through a cross lineal marriage system between the clans. This system was also important for the transfer of wealth within the Nation, with each clan reliant on the other for the building of longhouses, the carving of totem poles and other items of cultural importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nNoted seafarers, the Haida occupied more than 100 villages throughout the Islands. The Haida were skilled traders, with established trade links with their neighbouring First Nations on the mainland to California.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe archipelago was discovered by Europeans in 1774 by Juan Prez, at Langara Island,[28] and in 1778 by James Cook. In 1794, the Haida captured and sank a pair of European vessels, Ino and Resolution, that were seeking to trade for sea otter pelts.[29] Most of the ships' crew  were killed. In 1851, the Haida captured the Georgiana, a ship carrying gold prospectors, and held its crew for ransom for nearly two months.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe islands played an important role during the maritime fur trade era of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. During most of that era the trade in the islands was dominated by Americans.[31] The Oregon Treaty of 1846 put an end to American claims to the islands. Following the discovery of gold in the 1850s the British made efforts to exclude whatever American territorial claims might remain.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colony of the Queen Charlotte Islands was a British colony constituting the archipelago of the same name from 1853 to July 1863, when it was amalgamated into the Colony of British Columbia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colony of the Queen Charlotte Islands was created by the Colonial Office in response to the increase in American marine trading activity resulting from the gold rush on Moresby Island in 1851.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo separate administration or capital for the colony was ever established, as its only officer or appointee was James Douglas, who was simultaneously Governor of Vancouver Island. In essence, the colony was merged with the Vancouver Island colony for administrative purposes from the 1850s to 1866 when the Colony of Vancouver Island was merged with the mainland, which until that point was the separate Colony of British Columbia.\\r\\n\\r\\n In 1787 Captain George Dixon surveyed the islands. He named  the islands the Queen Charlotte Islands after his ship, the Queen Charlotte, which was named after Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of King George III of the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother name, \\"Washington's Isles,\\" was commonly used by American traders, who frequented the islands in the days of the marine fur trade and considered the islands part of the US-claimed Oregon Country.[4][33][34] Following the 1846 Oregon Treaty, which established the current international borders and made the islands definitively part of Canada, the \\"Queen Charlotte Islands\\" name became official.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 11, 2009, the BC government announced that legislation would be introduced in mid-2010 to officially rename the Queen Charlotte Islands. The legislation received royal assent on June 3, 2010, formalizing the name change.[2]  This name change is officially recognized by all levels of Canadian governments,[35] and also by the United States' National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency name database.[36] The name Haida Gwaii is a modern coinage and was created in the early 1980s as an alternative to the colonial-era name \\"Queen Charlotte Islands\\", to recognize the history of the Haida people.[2] \\"Haida Gwaii\\" means \\"islands of the people\\", while Haida on its own means not only \\"us\\" but also \\"people\\". \\r\\n\\r\\nStill in use is the older name Xaadala Gwayee or, in alternative orthography, Xhaaidlagha Gwaayaai, meaning \\"islands at the boundary of the world\\".[2] Xhaaydla (\\"worlds\\") refers here to the sea and sky.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch by Simon Fraser University concludes that Haida Gwaii around 55,000 BCE was likely covered with tundra and low meadows that were populated by grazing mammals including caribou and mammoths. Although no mammoth or mastodon fossils were found, the research discovered dung-eating fungi underground in ancient peat by the Cape Ball site in Naikoon Provincial Park on Graham Island.[37] The tundra-like landscape then evolved to a mix of alpine forest and meadows.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last Pleistocene glaciation receded from the archipelago about 16,000 BCE, about 2,000 years earlier than the rest of the British Columbia Coast's ice age[citation needed]. That, and its subsequent isolation from the mainland, encouraged Haida indigenous and environmental activists in the 1970s to use the term \\"Galpagos of the North\\", a unique biocultural zone with many endemic plants and animals. The climate of this temperate north hemisphere forested region, like that of much of the British Columbia and Alaskan coast in the area, is moderated by the North Pacific Current, with heavy rainfall and relatively mild temperatures throughout the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe islands are home to the Ta'an Forest, with a wide variety of large endemic trees, including the Sitka spruce, western red cedar, yellow cedar (Nootka cypress), shore pine, western hemlock, mountain hemlock, and red alder. The Flora of the Queen Charlotte Islands[38] describes plants from the islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoils are variable. Peat is common in poorly drained flats and even on sloping ground in the wetter areas. Where drainage is good, the mature soils are podzols which have classic development (well defined eluvial horizon, Ae under Canadian classification) in undisturbed areas.[39] A history of disturbance, as from logging or windthrow, sees the Ae mixed with other horizons and only patchily visible.[40]\\r\\nKiidk'yaas (Golden Spruce), a naturally occurring genetic-variant yellow-colour Sitka spruce tree, was near the Yakoun River, the largest on Graham Island. It was a popular tourist attraction until it was illegally cut down in 1997 as a protest against the industrial logging practices.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the spring of 1996 until November 30, 1997 a popular attraction for tourists to the islands was the male albino 'White Raven'. He lived around Port Clements and would commonly be seen taking food handouts from locals and visitors alike. He died after making contact with an electrical transformer. The White Raven was preserved by former Port Clements residents, taxidermists Roger Britten Sr. and Jr., and is on display in the Port Clements Historical Society's museum.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe climate is oceanic (Cfb), except near the summit of Mount Moresby where the climate is subpolar oceanic (Cfc). It is very similar to the climate of the west coast of Scotland in terms of average temperatures and precipitation, but the latitude is lower than the west coast of Scotland, it is 52 39', the same as southern Ireland.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the relatively shielded areas around Tlell and Sandspit annual rainfall averages from 1,200 millimetres (47?in) to 1,400 millimetres (55?in).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSnowfall is generally moderate, averaging from 10 centimetres (4?in) to 70 centimetres (28?in), though at northerly Langara Island it averages around 100 centimetres (40?in).\\r\\n\\r\\nPrecipitation is typically extremely frequent, occurring on around two-thirds of all days even in relatively shielded areas, and direct sunlight is scarce, averaging around 3 to 4 hours per day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2012, entrepreneur Russ George dispersed 100 short tons (91?t) of iron sulphate dust into the Pacific Ocean several hundred miles west of the islands of Haida Gwaii. The Old Massett Village Council was persuaded to finance this geoengineering project as a salmon enhancement project with $1 million in village funds.[44] The concept was that the formerly iron-deficient waters would produce more phytoplankton that would in turn produce more salmon. George hoped to finance the project by using the carbon sequestration effects of the new plankton as marketable carbon offsets. The project has been plagued by charges of unscientific procedures and recklessness. George contended that 100 tons of iron is negligible compared to what naturally enters the ocean.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nLawyers, environmentalists, and civil society groups are calling the dumping a \\"blatant violation\\" of two international moratoriums.[44][46] George said that the Old Massett Village Council and its lawyers approved the effort and at least seven Canadian agencies were aware of it.[45] In May 2013, the Haida Salmon Restoration Corporation removed George as a director of the company and ended his employment.[47] The 2013 salmon runs defied all expectations, more than quadrupling, from 50 million to 226 million fish. However, many environmental groups objected to the process.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe islands are located along the Queen Charlotte Fault, an active transform fault that produces significant earthquakes every 3ÿ30 years. This is the result of the converging of the Pacific and North American Plates along the archipelago's west coast.[49][50]  Major earthquakes have occurred in the Haida Gwaii in 1949 and 2012. Though the region is prone to fair geological activity, there is little infrastructure set up to gather accurate information to warn locals of possible threats. Many residents, notably from First Nations communities, have been critical of the fact that they must rely on information coming from neighboring American states such as Washington or Alaska and from the USGS (United States Geological Survey). Regardless of the inconsistencies, Environment Canada does regularly do field tests across the Pacific coast of British Columbia relating to this matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cascadia subduction zone does pose some additional earthquake risks, but most importantly the subduction zone poses direct tsunami risks to the coastal settlements on the western side of the islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artwork known as Spirit of Haida Gwaii, by Bill Reid, is featured on the reverse of Canadian $20 bills produced between 2004 and 2011.[51] It depicts a Haida chief in a canoe, accompanied by the mythic messengers Raven, Frog and Eagle (the first casting of this sculpture, Spirit of Haida Gwaii: The Black Canoe, is on display in the atrium of the Canadian Embassy in Washington DC, the other, Spirit of Haida Gwaii: the Jade Canoe, is on display in Vancouver Airport). Haida art is also frequently seen on large monumental-sized cedar totem poles and dugout canoes, hand-crafted gold and silver jewellery, and even as cartoons in the form of Haida manga.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Haida language was proposed for classification as part of the Nadene family of languages on the basis of a few similarities with AthabaskanÿEyakÿTlingit.  Many linguists, however, consider the evidence insufficient and continue to regard Haida as a language isolate. All 50 remaining speakers of Haida are over 70 years old. Telus and Gwaii Trust recently completed a project to bring broadband internet to the island via a 150?km (93?mi) microwave relay. This enables interactive research to be carried out on the more than 80?CDs of language, story and spoken history of the people.","input":"In what part of british columbia is haidi gwaii found?"},{"output":"Dianne Feinstein","context":"California elects United States Senators to Class 1 and Class 3.

PAs are trained with the medical model and complete these qualifications in less time than a traditional medical degree. The educational model for PAs is based on the fast-tracked training of physicians during World War II.\\r\\nPAs are concerned with preventing and treating human illness and injury by providing a plethora of health care services under a supervising physician.[1] Their scope of practice varies by jurisdiction and healthcare setting.\\r\\nThe occupational title originated in the United States in the 1960s; similar occupations elsewhere include clinical officers in parts of Africa and feldshers in states of the former Soviet Union.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysician assistants or physician associates (PAs) may:\\r\\nThey train to work in settings such as hospitals, clinics and other types of health facilities, or in academic administration, and exercise autonomy in medical decision making.

A period of extensive clinical training precedes obtaining a license to practice as a physician assistant, and similar to physician training but shorter in duration, includes all systems of the human body. Renewal of licensure is necessary every few years, varying by jurisdiction. PAs may also complete residency training, similar to physicians' residencies but significantly shorter, in fields such as: OB/GYN, emergency medicine, critical care, orthopedics, neurology, surgery, and other medical disciplines.\\r\\nIn 1961 Charles Hudson recommended to the American Medical Association (AMA), the \\"creation of two new groups of assistants to doctors from non-medical and non-nursing personnel.\\"[4] Dr. Eugene A. Stead, Jr. of the Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina assembled the first class of physician assistants in 1965, composed of four former U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsmen.[5][6] He based the curriculum of the PA program on his first-hand knowledge of the fast-track training of medical doctors during World War II.[7] Two other physicians, Richard Smith at the University of Washington in Seattle, and Hu Myers at Alderson-Broaddus College in Philippi, West Virginia, also launched their own programs in the mid and late 1960s. And Dr. J.

PAs are regulated in Manitoba and New Brunswick by the respective provincial college of physicians and surgeons. In both Ontario and Alberta, the profession is not regulated. However, the Ontario Minister of Health has recommended that a mandatory registry be established which would be governed by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario. In Alberta, a voluntary registry has been established for PAs under the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta.

The Faculty oversee the managed voluntary register, to which all practising PAs are encouraged to become a member of, as well as setting and running the National Assessment Examination and National Recertification Examination.\\r\\nPAs are trained under the medical model, similarly to doctors, to deliver high-quality medical care in both primary and secondary care settings. The role of PAs has developed to provide medical services similar to those provided by house officers or senior house officers. They are trained to perform a variety of tasks including diagnosis, treatment, complex medical procedures and taking medical histories.[16]\\r\\nThe title of physician associate is not a protected medical profession. Hence, even if a PA has been trained in pharmacology and IRMER[17] (ability to request radiology imaging ÿ X-rays), they are not able to prescribe or request imaging.[18] At present, there is no regulatory body for PAs, such as the General Medical Council (GMC) for doctors. Since June 2010, physician associates have been able to obtain membership of the Managed Voluntary Register (MVR) for physician associates.[19] This database, run by PAs for PAs, aims to identify all qualified PAs who are able to practise in the United Kingdom. It is intended to maintain high standards in the UK.[20] To remain on the register, physician associates in the United Kingdom are required to re-certify every 5ÿ6 years[21] and maintain up-to-date practice through attendance of training accumulating CPD hours (continuous professional development), which need to be completed on an annual basis.\\r\\nPA training in the UK is through a 2-year accelerated medical training (MSc or Postgraduate Diploma) in Physician Associate Studies. As of 2017[update] there are at least 32 universities offering these programs.\\r\\nBarts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) requires candidates to hold a minimum of 2:1 or above in a Life Science, Biomedical Science, or Healthcare subject. In addition, candidates must sit the UKCAT exam within 12 months of the deadline for application. Due to the competitive nature of this course, a ranking system will be used to shortlist for interview.\\r\\nAberdeen requires a science-based degree with a minimum 2:1 grade achieved and St George's requires a science-based degree with a minimum 2:2 grade achieved. This includes sport science, biology, psychology and biomedical degrees. Applicants should preferably have experience in the healthcare industry, such as a HCA or auxiliary nursing. Applications from other professionals such as nurses, radiographers and paramedics will also be considered.\\r\\nUniversity of Bradford requires a 2:1 (or above) undergraduate degree in a Life Science, Biomedical Science, or Healthcare subject. Under exceptional circumstances, extensive experience in healthcare practice may contribute and compensate if the above requirements have not been fully met.[33]\\r\\nIn the United States, the profession is represented by the American Academy of Physician Assistants, and all PAs must graduate from a nationally accredited ARC-PA program as well as passing the national certification exam.[34] It was not until 1970 that the AMA passed a resolution to develop educational guidelines and certification procedures for PAs.[4] The Duke University Medical Center Archives had established the Physician Assistant History Center, dedicated to the study, preservation, and presentation of the history of the PA profession. The PA History Center became its own institution in 2011, was renamed the PA History Society, and is now located in Johns Creek, Georgia.[35]\\r\\nAs of October 2016[update], there were 218 accredited PA programs in the United States, and dozens more in development, represented by the Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA).[36] Most educational programs are graduate programs leading to the award of master's degrees in either Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS), Health Science (MHS), or Medical Science (MMSc), and require a bachelor's degree and GRE or MCAT scores for entry. The majority of PA programs in the United States utilize the CASPA application for selecting students.[36] Professional licensure is regulated by the medical boards of the individual states. Physician assistant students train at medical schools and academic medical centers across the country.\\r\\nPhysician assistant education is based on medical education[37] although unlike medical school which lasts four years plus a specialty-specific residency, PA training is usually 2 to 3 years of full-time study, completed during their post-graduate studies, for a total of 6ÿ7 years of science-based postsecondary education.[38] The didactic training of PA education consists of classroom and laboratory instruction in medical and behavioral sciences, such as anatomy, microbiology, immunology, pharmacology, pathophysiology, hematology, pathology, genetics, clinical medicine, and physical diagnosis, followed by clinical rotations in internal medicine, family medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency medicine, and geriatric medicine, as well as elective rotations.[citation needed] Unlike physicians, who must complete a minimum of three years of residency after completion of medical school, PAs are not required to complete such residencies after they complete their schooling. Despite this, there are residency programs in certain specialties for PAs who choose to continue formal education in such a format.[39]\\r\\nPA clinical postgraduate programs are clinical training programs which differ from training on the job in their inclusion of didactic education and supervised clinical experience to meet learning objectives which are clearly defined.[40] The Montefiore Medical Center Postgraduate Surgical Physician Assistant Program was established in 1971 as the first clinical postgraduate PA program to be recognized.[40] Currently, there are known to be 49 programs in various specialties such as Neurology, Trauma/Critical Care and Oncology.[41] The Association of Postgraduate Physician Assistant Programs was formed in 1988 as an instrument in the establishment of educational standards for postgraduate PA programs[40] and currently includes 50 member programs.[41]\\r\\nA physician assistant may use the post-nominal initials \\"PA\\", \\"PA-C\\", \\"APA-C\\", \\"RPA\\" or \\"RPA-C\\", where the \\"-C\\" indicates \\"Certified\\" and the \\"R\\" indicates \\"Registered\\". The \\"R\\" designation is unique to a few states, mainly in the Northeast. APA stands for aeromedical physician assistant and indicates that a physician assistant successfully completed the U.S. Army Flight Surgeon Primary Course.[42] During training, PA students are designated PA-S. The use of \\"PA-C\\" is limited only to those PAs currently certified and in compliance with the regulations of the national certifying organization, the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants and who have passed the PANCE.\\r\\nIn the United States, a graduate from an accredited PA program must pass the NCCPA-administered Physician Assistant National Certifying Exam (PANCE) before becoming a PA-C; this certification is required for licensure in all states.[43] The content of the exam is covered in the PANCE BLUEPRINT. In addition, a PA must log 100 Continuing Medical Education (CME) hours and reregister his or her certificate with the NCCPA every two years. Every ten years (formerly six years), a PA must also recertify by successfully completing the Physician Assistant National Recertifying Exam (PANRE)[44][45]\\r\\n\\"National Physician Assistant Week\\" is celebrated annually in the US from October 6 through October 12. This week was chosen to commemorate the anniversary of the first graduating physician assistant class at Duke University on October 6, 1967.[46]\\r\\nPhysician assistants have their own licenses with distinct scope of practice.[47] Each of the 50 states has different laws regarding the prescription of medications by PAs and the licensing authority granted to each category within that particular state through the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).[48] PAs in Kentucky, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are not allowed to prescribe any controlled substances.[49] Several other states place a limit on the type of controlled substance or the quantity that can be prescribed, dispensed, or administered by a PA.[49] Although categorized as mid-level practitioners, that characterization has been contested by practicing PA's[citation needed]. Depending upon the specific laws of any given state board of medicine, the PA must have a formal relationship on file with a collaborative physician. The collaborating physician must also be licensed in the state in which the PA is working, although he or she may physically be located elsewhere. Physician collaboration can be in person, by telecommunication systems or by other reliable means (for example, availability for consultation). In emergency departments the laws governing PA practice differ by state, generally allowing a broad scope of practice and limited direct supervision.[50]\\r\\nThe first employer of PAs was the then-Veterans Administration (VA), known today as the Department of Veterans Affairs. Today, the VA is the largest single employer of PAs, employing nearly 2,000 PAs.\\r\\nAccording to the AAPA, there are more than 108,500 certified PAs in the United States as of 2016.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the 2008 AAPA census, 56 percent of responding PAs worked in physicians' offices or clinics and 24 percent were employed by hospitals.[51] The remainder were employed in public health clinics, nursing homes, schools, prisons, home health care agencies, and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs[52] Fifteen percent of responding PAs work in counties classified as non-metropolitan by Economic Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture;[53] approximately 17% of the US population resides in these counties.[54]\\r\\nThe U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics report on PAs states, \\"...Employment of physician assistants is expected to grow 27 percent from 2006 to 2016, much faster than the average for all occupations...\\"[55] This is due to several factors, including an expanding health care industry, an aging baby-boomer population, concerns for cost containment, and newly implemented restrictions to shorten physician resident work hours.\\r\\nFor PAs in primary care practice, malpractice insurance policies with $100,000ÿ300,000 in coverage can cost less than $600 per year; premiums are higher for PAs in higher-risk specialties.[56]\\r\\nMoney magazine, in conjunction with Salary.com, listed the PA profession as the \\"fifth best job in America\\" in May 2006, based both on salary and job prospects, and on an anticipated 10-year job growth of 49.65%.[57] In 2010, CNN Money rated the Physician Assistant Career as the number two Best Job In America.[58] In 2012, Forbes rated the Physician Assistant Degree as the number one master's degree for jobs.[59] In 2015, Glassdoor rated Physician Assistant as the number one Best Job In America.[60] According to the 2014 National Salary Survey of PAs, the mean total income for physician assistants working full-time was $112,344.[61] Physician assistants in emergency medicine, dermatology, and surgical subspecialties may earn $100,000 to $200,000 per year.[62]\\r\\nPAs are employed by the United States Department of State as Foreign Service Health Practitioners (FSHP). PAs working in this capacity may be deployed anywhere in the world where there is a State Department facility. They provide primary care to U.S. government employees and their families in American embassies and consulates around the world. An important part of their jobs is to get to know what resources are available locally that they can count on in an emergency. FSHPs have some other important roles, such as advising their ambassadors on the health situation in the country and provide health education to the diplomatic community. In order to be considered for the position of FSHP these PAs must be licensed and have at least two years of recent experience in primary care.[63]\\r\\nMilitary PAs serve in the White House Medical Unit, where they provide care to the president and vice president and their families as well as White House staff.\\r\\nU.S. Army PAs typically serve as Medical Specialist Corps officers within Army combat or combat support battalions located in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and overseas.[64] These include infantry, armor, cavalry, airborne, artillery, and (if the PA qualifies) Special Forces units. They serve as the \\"front line\\" of Army medicine and along with combat medics are responsible for the total health care of soldiers assigned to their unit, as well as of their family members.[citation needed]\\r\\nPAs also serve in the Air Force and Navy as clinical practitioners and aviation medicine specialists, as well as in the Coast Guard and Public Health Service. The skills required for these PAs are similar to that of their civilian colleagues, but additional training is provided in advanced casualty care, medical management of chemical injuries, aviation medicine, and military medicine.[citation needed] In addition, military PAs are also required to meet the officer commissioning requirements, and maintain the professional and physical readiness standards of their respective services.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Marine Physician Assistant (MPA) is a U.S. Merchant Mariner Staff Officer. A Certificate of Registry is granted through The United States Coast Guard National Maritime Center (NMC) located in Martinsburg, West Virginia.[65] Formal training programs for Marine Physician Assistants began in September, 1966 at the Public Service Health Hospital located in Staten Island, N.Y.[66]\\r\\nThe first PA program in India was established in 1992.[67]","input":"What is a pa c in medical terms?"},{"output":"maximum aperture diameter, or minimum f-number, of a photographic lens. A lens with a larger maximum aperture (that is, a smaller minimum f-number)","context":"Lens speed refers to the maximum aperture diameter, or minimum f-number, of a photographic lens. A lens with a larger maximum aperture (that is, a smaller minimum f-number) is called a \\"fast lens\\" because it can achieve the same exposure with a faster shutter speed. Conversely, a smaller maximum aperture (larger minimum f-number) is \\"slow\\" because it delivers less light intensity and requires a slower (longer) shutter speed.\\r\\nA fast lens speed is desirable in taking pictures in dim light, or with long telephoto lenses and for controlling depth of field and bokeh, especially in portrait photography,[1] and for sports photography and photojournalism.\\r\\nLenses may also be referred to as being \\"faster\\" or \\"slower\\" than one another; so an f/3.5 lens can be described as faster than an f/5.6.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAttaining maximum lens speed requires engineering tradeoffs, and as such, \\"prime\\" (fixed focal length) lenses are generally faster than zoom lenses, and modern manual-focus lenses are generally faster than their autofocus counterparts.[2]\\r\\nWith 35mm cameras, the fastest lenses are typically in the \\"normal lens\\" range near 50mm and there are several high-quality fast lenses available that are relatively inexpensive. For example, the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II or Nikon AF Nikkor 50mm f/1.8D are very inexpensive, but quite fast and optically well-regarded. Old fast manual focus lenses, just as the Nikkor-S(C) or Nikkor AI-S 50mm f/1.4, were historically produced abundantly, and are thus sold relatively inexpensively on the used lens market.\\r\\nEspecially outside of the \\"normal lenses\\", lens speed also tends to correlate with the price and/or quality of the lens. This is because lenses with larger maximum apertures require greater care with regard to design, precision of manufacture, special coatings and quality of glass. At wide apertures, spherical aberration becomes more significant and must be corrected. Faster telephoto and wide-angle retrofocus designs tend to be much more expensive.\\r\\nThe fastest lenses in general production now are f/1.2 or f/1.4, with more at f/1.8 and f/2.0, and many at f/2.8 or slower. What is considered \\"fast\\" has evolved to lower f-numbers over the years, due to advances in lens design, optical manufacturing, quality of glass, optical coatings, and the move toward smaller imaging formats. For example, the 1911 Encyclop?dia Britannica states that \\"...[Lenses] are also sometimes classified according to their rapidity, as expressed by their effective apertures, into extra rapid, with apertures larger than f/6; rapid, with apertures from f/6 to f/8; slow, with apertures less than f/11.\\"\\r\\nFor scale, note that f/0.5, f/0.7, f/1.0, f/1.4, and f/2.0 are each 1 f-stop apart (2G as fast), as an f-stop corresponds to a factor of square root of 2, about 1.4. Thus around f/1.0, a change of 0.1 corresponds to about 1/4 of an f-stop (by linear approximation): f/1.0 is about 50% faster than f/1.2, which is about 50% faster than f/1.4.\\r\\nAs of 2017[update], Canon, Nikon, Pentax and Sony all make an autofocus 50mm f/1.4 lens. These are not unusual lenses and are relatively inexpensive. Canon also makes autofocus 50mm and 85mm f/1.2 lenses, while Nikon makes a manual focus 50mm f/1.2 lens and an autofocus 85mm f/1.4; see Canon EF 50mm lenses and Canon EF 85mm lenses for details. Pentax makes a 50mm f/1.4 lens and 55mm f/1.4 lens for APS-C cameras; see Pentax lenses. Sony makes a 50mm f/1.4 lens which is a continuation of the Minolta AF 50mm f/1.4 lens, and two lenses with Carl Zeiss: a 50mm f/1.4 and 85mm f/1.4.\\r\\nThe maximum exposure time in free-hand photography can be enhanced even more also for fast lenses, if the camera is equipped with an image stabilisation system. In 2014 Panasonic introduced the fastest lens with in-built stabilisation, the Leica Nocticron 42.5?mm f/1.2, which in the meantime even can be operated with dual image stabilisation (Dual I.S.), provided that the camera body has an additional stabilising system at the image sensor, too.\\r\\nIn the mid 60s there was something of a fad for fast lenses among the major manufacturers.[3] In 1966 in response to the trend Carl Zeiss displayed a prop lens christened the Super-Q-Gigantar 40mm f/0.33 at photokina.[3] Made from various parts found around the factory (the lenses came from a darkroom condenser enlarger), the claimed speed and focal lengths were purely nominal and it wasn't usable for photography.[3][4]\\r\\nUltimately, the speed of a lens is limited by mechanical constraints of the camera system (shutter or mirror clearance, mount diameter). The smallest possible working f-number is\\r\\nwhere\\r\\nThis sets a limit close to f/1.0 to f/1.2 for most SLR mounts, whereas lenses for rangefinder and mirrorless cameras can be faster, as they can be brought closer to the image plane. Reproduction lenses incapable of infinity focus can have nominal f-numbers smaller than this limit, as the limit applies to the working f-number (the f-number corrected by the bellows factor), not to the nominal f-number. It should be noted that only the working f-number correctly assesses the light gathering power of the lens.\\r\\nSince sin Ĳ < 1, it follows that no lens can be faster than f/0.5 if it operates in air. Lenses can be made faster than this by requiring the film emulsion to be in physical contact with the rear element, thus eliminating the air gap between the lens and the emulsion. Another option is to use oil immersion techniques.\\r\\nSome of the fastest camera lenses in production as of 2017[update] were as follows:\\r\\nThe following camera lenses are no longer in production as of 2010[update]:\\r\\nMany very fast lenses exist in C-mount (such as used by 16mm film cameras, CCTV, medical & scientific imaging systems), including:\\r\\nVery fast lenses in D-mount for 8mm movie use on H8 cameras:\\r\\nVery fast lenses used in x-ray machines:","input":"What does the speed of a lens mean?"},{"output":"Emil Minty","context":"Emil Minty (born 1972) is an Australian former child actor.

Reiss.[1]\\r\\nSince 1916 (and when the studio was formed by the merger of Samuel Goldwyn's studio with Marcus Loew's Metro Pictures and Louis B. Mayer's company in 1924), there have been seven different lions used for the MGM logo. Although MGM has referred to all of the lions used in their trademark as \\"Leo the Lion\\", only the current lion, in use since 1957 (a total of 60 years), was actually named \\"Leo\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSlats,[2] trained by Volney Phifer, was the first lion used for the newly formed studio. Born at the Dublin Zoo[3] on March 20, 1919 and originally named Cairbre,[4] Slats was used on all black-and-white MGM films between 1924 and 1928. The original logo was designed by Howard Dietz and used by the Goldwyn Pictures Corporation studio from 1916 to 1924 (see left). Goldwyn Pictures was ultimately absorbed into the partnership that formed MGM, and the first MGM film that used the logo was He Who Gets Slapped (1924). Dietz stated that he decided to use a lion as the company's mascot as a tribute to his alma mater Columbia University, whose athletic teams' nickname is The Lions; he further added that Columbia's fight song, \\"Roar, Lion, Roar\\", inspired him to make the lion roar. Ironically, unlike his successors, Slats did nothing but look around in the logo (as did the Goldwyn Pictures lion), making him the only MGM lion not to roar (although it is rumored that Volney Phifer trained the lion to growl on cue, despite the fact that synchronized sound would not officially be used in motion pictures until 1927). Slats died in 1936;[5] his hide is currently on display at the McPherson Museum in McPherson, Kansas.[6]\\r\\nJackie,[2] trained by Mel Koontz, was the second lion used for the MGM logo. He was the first MGM lion to roar, which was first heard via a gramophone record for MGM's first production with sound, White Shadows in the South Seas (1928). Jackie roared/growled three times before looking off to the right of the screen; in the early years that this logo was used (1928ÿc. 1933), there was a slightly extended version wherein, after looking off to the right, the lion would return his gaze to the front a few seconds later. Jackie appeared on all black-and-white MGM films from 1928 to 1956 (replacing Slats), as well as the sepia-tinted opening credits of The Wizard of Oz (1939). He also appeared before MGM's black-and-white cartoons, such as the Flip the Frog and Willie Whopper series produced for MGM by the short-lived Ub Iwerks Studio, as well as the Captain and the Kids cartoons produced by MGM in 1938 and 1939. A colorized variation of the logo can be found on the colorized version of Babes in Toyland (1934), also known as March of the Wooden Soldiers; an animated version (done via rotoscope) appeared on the 1939 Captain and the Kids cartoon Petunia Natural Park. Jackie died on February 26, 1952. He would later make a comeback at the beginning of the film Hearts of the West (1975).\\r\\nIn the early 1930s, MGM reissued some of its earlier, pre-1928 silent films with prerecorded music soundtracks and sound effects; such films included Greed (1924), Ben-Hur (1925) and Flesh and the Devil (1926). For these sound reissues, Slats was plastered over by Jackie, causing some film authorities to assume that the lion had been in use before 1928.\\r\\nIn addition to appearing in the MGM logo, Jackie appeared in over a hundred films, including the Tarzan movies that starred Johnny Weissmuller. Jackie also appeared with an apprehensive Greta Garbo in a well-known 1926 publicity still. The lion is also known for surviving several accidents (including two train wrecks, an earthquake, and an explosion in the studio), giving him the nickname \\"Leo the Lucky\\".\\r\\nFor the films Westward the Women and The Next Voice You Hear... (both 1950), a still frame of the logo -- sans growlingwas used at the beginning.\\r\\nMGM began experiments with two-strip color short subjects in 1928 and animated cartoons in 1930. For these productions, two different lions were used. The first lion, Telly, appeared on all color MGM movies between 1928 and 1932. The second lion, Coffee, appeared on color films between 1932 and 1934 (and 1935 for the Happy Harmonies shorts), until production was switched to full three-strip Technicolor filming. The Cat and the Fiddle (1934) had brief color sequences, but was otherwise in black-and-white (including its opening credits), so it used Jackie instead of Coffee. (The Cat and the Fiddle however, showed its The End title card against a Technicolor background.)\\r\\nAn extended version of the logo featuring Coffee appears at the beginning of the short Wild People (1932), featuring the lion roaring three times, rather than just twice. Also, an extended version of the logo featuring Telly appeared at the beginning of the film The Viking (1928), featuring the lion roaring/growling three times, rather than twice.\\r\\nMGM began producing full three-strip Technicolor films in 1934. Tanner,[2] also trained by Mel Koontz, was used on all Technicolor MGM films (1934ÿ1953) and cartoons (1935ÿ1958, 1963ÿ1967, except for 1965's The Dot and the Line), replacing Telly and Coffee. The Wizard of Oz (1939) had the Oz scenes in color, but it had the opening credits, closing credits, and the Kansas scenes in sepia-toned black-and-white, so it used Jackie instead of Tanner. Third Dimensional Murder (1941) was shot in 3-D and in Technicolor, but it had the opening credits in black-and-white, so it also used Jackie instead of Tanner. The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945) and The Secret Garden (1949) both had brief color sequences, but were otherwise in black-and-white (including their opening credits), so they used Jackie instead of Tanner as well. (The Secret Garden, however, showed its The End title card and the cast list against a Technicolor background.) Tanner roared three times in the logo; in extended version of this logo appeared on the short Star Night at the Coconut Grove and early James A. Fitzpatrick Traveltalks color shorts, with two additional roars from the lion.\\r\\nTanner, whose first appearance was before the short subject Star Night at the Coconut Grove (1934) (his first feature film appearance was before Sweethearts four years later, in 1938), was MGM's third longest-lived lion to be used (for a total of 22 years), after Jackie (who was used for a total of 28 years) and the current lion (who has been retained for 60 years). It is this version of the logo that was the most frequently used version throughout the Golden Age of Hollywood, although color did not really become the norm until the 1960s (and even then, many movies were still being made in black-and-white).\\r\\nIn addition to being used as MGM's lion mascot, Tanner also made an appearance in the Three Stooges short Hold That Lion! (1947). Also, between the mid 1940s and 1960s, MGM's cartoon studio would use Tanner's roar as a sound effect for many of their animated shorts.\\r\\nTanner and Jackie were both kept in the change from Academy ratio films to widescreen CinemaScope movies in 1953, with Tanner for color movies and Jackie for black-and-white films. The logo was modified for this change; the marquee below the ribbon design was removed, and the company name was thus placed in a semi-circle above the ribbons.\\r\\nThe sixth lion, officially named George,[7] was introduced in 1956, and appeared more heavily maned than any of the other lions. Two different versions featuring George were used; one with the lion roaring toward the right of the screen and then roaring at the camera, and another with the lion roaring toward the upright corner of the screen. This logo would have either a black or dark brownish/grayish background, although a blue background variant has been spotted on The Wings of Eagles (1957). This logo would also appear on black-and-white movies.\\r\\nLeo, the seventh lion, is by far MGM's longest-used lion, having appeared on most MGM films since 1957. He was born in Dublin Zoo, Ireland. He was also the youngest at the time MGM filmed him roaring (hence his much smaller mane).\\r\\nLeo was purchased from famous animal dealer Henry Trefflich, and trained by Ralph Helfer. In addition to being used as the MGM lion, Leo also appeared in other productions such as the religious epic King of Kings (1961), Zebra in the Kitchen (1965), Fluffy (1965), and Napoleon and Samantha (1972); as well as a memorable TV commercial for Dreyfus Investments in 1961. Leo also made several appearances on the 1971-72 TV series The Pet Set, proving himself gentle enough to let a blind teenage girl pet him in one episode.\\r\\nTwo different versions of this logo were used: an \\"extended\\" version, with the lion roaring three times (used from 1957ÿ1960); and the \\"standard\\" version, with the lion roaring twice (used since 1960). In the Chuck Jones-directed Tom and Jerry cartoons released between 1963 and 1967, Tanner was used in the opening sequence instead of Leo. Three MGM films, Raintree County (1957), Ben-Hur (1959), and Mutiny on the Bounty (1962), utilized a still-frame variation of this logo (Raintree County and Mutiny of the Bounty, however, would also have the lion's roar played along with their opening scores). For Ben-Hur, the reason for this was because the film's director, William Wyler, thought that the roar would feel out of place for the opening nativity scene of the movie. This logo would also appear on black-and-white films, such as Jailhouse Rock (1957) and A Patch of Blue (1965). Some television prints of the 1943 film Cabin in the Sky, have replaced the Jackie logo with Leo for unknown reasons.\\r\\nIn 1965, in attempt to update its image, MGM recruited Lippincott to create a more contemporary logo.[8] The result, a circular still graphic image of a lion known as \\"The Stylized Lion\\", appeared at the front of three films in the 1960s: Grand Prix (1966), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and The Subject Was Roses (1968). Afterwards, Leo was reinstated for the opening logo. The Stylized Lion, however, was retained by the studio as its print logo, used by the MGM Records division studio advertising, in addition to being shown at the end of credit rolls following most MGM movie releases of this period, continuing until 1982. It was later used by the MGM Grand casinos. (A refined version of it is used as the logo for their parent company, MGM Resorts International.)\\r\\nThe logo was retained in the corporate revamp following their acquisition of United Artists in 1981. The logo now read \\"MGM/UA Entertainment Co.\\"; this logo would appear on all MGM/UA films from 1983 until 1986 and again in 1987 on the film O.C. and Stiggs (which was originally produced in 1985). It was also at this time that the original lion roar sound (which, in fact, sampled Tanner's roar) was replaced with a remade, stereophonic one, redone by Mark Mangini (and, ironically, consisting of tiger sounds; as Mangini would later explain, \\"[L]ions don't make that kind of ferocious noises [sic], and the logo needed to be ferocious and majestic.\\"[9]). The first film to use the new roar sound was Poltergeist (1982). Incidentally, the sound effect was also used for the \\"door ghost\\" near the end of the film.\\r\\nFrom 1984 to 1985, MGM used a variation of its main studio logo for its 60th anniversary based on the print logo, with the ribbons in a golden color. Above the ribbons were the words \\"Diamond Jubilee\\", replacing the standard company name,and it's font color was silver' and below the ribboning was the phrase \\"Sixty Years of Great Entertainment\\". The \\"Ars Gratia Artis\\" motto was removed from inside the circle and replaced with the text \\"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/United Artists\\". The drama mask from the bottom had its surrounding laurels removed, and the mask itself was moved up a little so that an additional golden ribbon with the text reading \\"Entertainment Co.\\" below would be added . Although the new roar effect done by Mangini was primarily being used at the time, 2010: The Year We Make Contact (1984) had both the original and 1982 roar effects mixed together.\\r\\nWhen the company began using MGM and UA as separate brands in 1986, a new logo for MGM was introduced; the same gold ribbons used for the \\"Diamond Jubilee\\" variant was retained, and the text was redone in exactly the same color. The following year, a new \\"MGM/UA Communications Co.\\" logo was introduced, and would precede both the MGM and UA logos until it was dropped in 1990. (However, both logos would maintain the byline \\"An MGM/UA Communications Company\\" until 1992.) Leo's roar was remixed again in 1995, because an MGM executive found the then-current roar to be \\"lacking muscle\\". Using digital audio technology to blend many roars together, including the 1982 roar, the new roar effect debuted with the release of Cutthroat Island (1995). (The purpose of the new roar, also done by Mark Mangini, was not only to give the sound more \\"muscle\\", but also to fit into films with 5.1 surround sound.) In 2001, MGM's website address, \\"www.mgm.com\\", was added to the bottom of the logo.\\r\\nThe logo was revised again in 2008, with the ribbons, text, and drama mask done in a more brilliant gold color. Also, Leo's image was digitally restored and enhanced, thanks to the work of staff at Pacific Title: first off, a three-dimensional model of Leo's mane was designed, and then composited and blended onto the lion's actual mane; secondly, the tips of the lion's ears were digitally remodeled, so that they (especially the tip of his left ear) would now cross in front of the film ribbon, in an effort to give the logo more \\"depth\\".[10] For the restoration process, the extended \\"three-roar\\" version of Leo's footage was used[11], although for MGM's upcoming feature films, it would have to be shortened to show the lion roaring just twice. (The new logo's design was, interestingly enough, based on that of MGM's then-current print logo, which had been introduced in 1992.), The website address was also shortened to, \\"MGM.COM\\". The lion's roar was remixed once again by sound editor Eric Martel[12], maintaining most of the original 1982 sound elements. However, beginning with The Taking of Pelham 123 (2009), the 1995 roar was reused. The newly-done logo debuted with the release of the James Bond film Quantum of Solace\\r\\nIn 2012, Shine Studio was chosen to redesign and animate the logo in stereoscopic 3-D (three-dimensional). Shine modeled a close up of Leo's eye creating an element to pull back through for a dramatic reveal of the lion, laurels and filmstrip. All the elements of the logo were re-built in 3-D and then placed on different planes to add dimensional layers and drama. The 1995 roar is reused once again as Leo roars and the company name is brought in from above to center the top screen, which completes the logo sequence. MGM's website address was removed, as MGM is no longer as of 2012 a self-distribution entity, but rather a production company. This logo was first used in the 2012 film Skyfall.\\r\\nThe 1983 Canadian beer-themed comedy film Strange Brew opens with a one-off version of the MGM logo where the lion belches within one second of the fade-in. Then the lion grunts and the camera begins a sweeping dolly move to the right and then the rear of the logo. Behind the logo, Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas as Bob and Doug McKenzie are trying to goad the sedate lion into roaring. Thomas (as Doug) says, \\"Maybe I oughta crank his tail, eh? That oughta start him up.\\" He then begins cranking the lion's tail, yelling \\"start up, eh!\\" When the lion stirs, Moranis (as Bob) says \\"Oh, jeez, he's getting mad, eh?\\" Then, in a breaking of the fourth wall, they both notice the camera and run to their \\"Great White North\\" set to begin the movie. The lion is believed to be George the Lion.\\r\\nMGM also used a secondary logo, seen in the opening and closing credits of many classic MGM movies. This design originated as the Metro-Goldwyn Pictures logo from 1924 to 1925. The logo features a graphic image of a reclining lion (from a side view) on a pedestal that has the text \\"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Picture\\" inscribed on it. Behind the lion is a semi-circular film ribbon with the \\"Ars Gratia Artis\\" motto, much like the film ribboning of the company's primary logo. On either side of the pedestal are torches. This secondary logo was used in the opening title and end titles of most MGM films from the 1920s until the early 1960s, then moved to the main film credits until the mid-1980s. For example, the logo is seen on the 1983 release A Christmas Story during the closing credits.\\r\\nMany of the short subjects produced by Hal Roach studios during the late 1920s and 1930s (such as Our Gang and Laurel and Hardy) featured a variation of the secondary logo in their closing titles. This variation had a lion cub on the pedestal, looking straight at the viewer.\\r\\nIn addition, many MGM films made in the late 1930s and early '40s set their entire opening credits against a background of a relief carving of an outline of the reclining lion image. Among the films that include this kind of credits sequence are the 1938 version of A Christmas Carol, based on the Charles Dickens novel, and Ninotchka from 1939, starring Greta Garbo. This reclining lion image was later used as the logo for MGM Television in the late 1950s.","input":"What was the original name of the mgm lion?"},{"output":"Dutch","context":"The history of New York City has been influenced by the prehistoric geological formation during the last glacial period of the territory that is today New York City. The area was long inhabited by the Lenape; after initial European exploration in the 16th century, the Dutch established New Amsterdam in 1626. In 1664, the English conquered the area and renamed it New York.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArchaeological excavations indicate that the first humans settled the area as early as 9,000 years ago. The area was abandoned, however, possibly because the warming climate of the region lead to the local extinction of many larger game species upon which the early inhabitants depended for food.\\r\\nA second wave of inhabitants entered the region approximately 3,000 years ago and left behind more advanced hunting implements such as bows and arrows. The remains of approximately 8,000 such early encampments have been found throughout the city. The region has probably remained continually inhabited from that time.\\r\\nBy the time of the arrival of Europeans, the Lenape were cultivating fields of vegetation through the slash and burn technique.[1][2][3][4][5][6] This extended the productive life of planted fields. They also harvested vast quantities of fish and shellfish from the bays of the area,[7] and, in southern New Jersey, harvested clams year-round.[8] The success of these methods allowed the tribe to maintain a larger population than nomadic hunter-gatherers could support. Scholars have estimated that at the time of European settlement, there may have been about 15,000 Lenape total in approximately 80 settlement sites around much of the New York City area, alone.[9]:5-6 In 1524 Lenape in canoes met Giovanni da Verrazzano, the first European explorer to enter New York Harbor, who called the area New Angoulme to honor his patron, King Francis I of France.[10]\\r\\nIn 1613, the Dutch established a trading post on the western shore of Manhattan Island. Jan Rodrigues was the first documented non-Native American to live on Manhattan Island.[11]\\r\\nIn 1614 the New Netherland company was established, and consequently they settled a second fur trading post in what is today Albany, called Fort Nassau. It was not until 1623, however, that the Dutch interests in the area were other than commercial, and under the auspices of the newly formed Dutch West India Company they built Fort Amsterdam in 1624, a crude fortification that stood on the location of the present Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House on Bowling Green. The fort was designed mainly to protect the company's trading operations further upriver from attack by other European powers. Within a year, a small settlement, called New Amsterdam had grown around the fort, with a population that included mostly the garrison of company troops, as well as a contingent of Walloon, French and Flemish huguenot families who were brought in primarily to farm the nearby land of lower Manhattan and supply the company operations with food. Sarah Rapalje (b.1625) was the first European born in the future New York City. Later in 1626, Peter Minuit purchased Manhattan Island and Staten Island from native people in exchange for trade goods.[12]\\r\\nThe Dutch took heavy advantage of the Native American reliance on wampum as a trading medium by exchanging cheap European-made metal tools for beaver pelts. By using such tools, the natives greatly increased the rate of production of wampum, debasing its value for trade. Lenape men abandoned hunting and fishing for food in favor of beaver trapping. Moreover, the Dutch began manufacturing their own wampum with superior tools in order to further dominate the trading network among themselves and the natives (a practice undertaken by the settlers in New England as well). As a result of this increase, beavers were largely trapped out in the Five Boroughs within two decades, leaving the Lenape largely dependent on the Dutch. As a result, the native population declined drastically throughout the 17th century through a combination of disease, starvation, and outward migration.\\r\\nAs the beaver trade shifted to Upstate New York, New Amsterdam became an increasingly important trading hub for the coast of North America. Since New Netherland was a trading operation and not viewed as colonization enterprise for transplanting Dutch culture, the directors of New Netherland were largely unconcerned with the ethnic and racial balance of the community. The economic activity brought in a wide variety of ethnic groups to the fledgling city during the 17th century, including Spanish, Jews, and Africans, some of them as slaves.\\r\\nThe Dutch origins can still be seen in many names in New York City, such as Coney Island (from \\"Konijnen Eiland\\" ÿ Dutch for \\"Rabbit Island\\"), Bowery from bouwerij (modern Dutch boerderij = \\"farm\\"), Brooklyn (from Breukelen), Harlem from Haarlem (formalized in 1658 as Nieuw Haarlem), Greenwich Village (from Greenwijck, meaning \\"pine wood quarter\\"), Flushing (from Vlissingen) and Staten Island (from \\"Staaten Eylandt\\").\\r\\nWillem Kieft became director general in 1638 but five years later was embroiled in Kieft's War against the Native Americans.[13] The Pavonia Massacre, across the Hudson River in present-day Jersey City resulted in the death of eighty natives in February 1643. Following the massacre, eleven Algonquian tribes joined forces and nearly defeated the Dutch. Holland sent additional forces to the aid of Kieft, which took part in the overwhelming defeat of the Native Americans, leading to a peace treaty on August 29, 1645, to end the war.[14]\\r\\nManhattan Island was in some measure self-selected as a future metropolis by its extraordinary natural harbor formed by New York Bay (actually the drowned lower river valley of the Hudson River, enclosed by glacial moraines), the East River (actually a tidal strait) and the Hudson River, all of which are confluent at the southern tip, from which all later development spread. Also of prime importance was the presence of deep fresh water aquifers near the southern tip, especially the Collect Pond, and an unusually varied geography ranging from marshland to large outcrops of Manhattan schist, a hard metamorphic rock that is ideal for foundations of large buildings.\\r\\nIn 1664, English ships entered Gravesend Bay in modern Brooklyn, and troops marched to capture the ferry across the East River to the city, with minimal resistance: the governor at the time, Peter Stuyvesant, was unpopular with the residents of the city. Articles of Capitulation 1664 were drawn up, the Dutch West India Company's colors were struck on September 8, 1664, and the soldiers of the garrison marched to the East River for the trip home to the Netherlands. The date of 1664 appeared on New York City's corporate seal until 1975, when the date was changed to 1625 to reflect the year of Dutch incorporation as a city and to incidentally allow New York to celebrate its 350th anniversary just 11 years after its 300th.\\r\\nThe English renamed the colony New York, after the king's brother James, Duke of York and on June 12, 1665, appointed Thomas Willett the first of the mayors of New York. The city grew northward, remaining the largest and most important city in the colony of New York.","input":"Who were the original settlers of new york?"},{"output":"Vienna","context":"Ludwig van Beethoven (/?l?dv? v?n ?be??to?v?n/?(?listen), /?be?t?ho?v?n/; German: [?lu?tv?? fan ?be?t?ho?fn?]?(?listen); baptised 17?December 1770[1]?ÿ 26?March 1827) was a German composer and pianist. A crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras in Western art music, he remains one of the most famous and influential of all composers. His best-known compositions include 9 symphonies, 5 piano concertos, 1 violin concerto, 32 piano sonatas, 16 string quartets, his great Mass the Missa solemnis, and one opera, Fidelio.\\r\\nBorn in Bonn, then the capital of the Electorate of Cologne and part of the Holy Roman Empire, Beethoven displayed his musical talents at an early age and was taught by his father Johann van Beethoven and by composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe. At the age of 21 he moved to Vienna, where he began studying composition with Joseph Haydn and gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist. He lived in Vienna until his death. By his late 20s his hearing began to deteriorate, and by the last decade of his life he was almost completely deaf. In 1811 he gave up conducting and performing in public but continued to compose; many of his most admired works come from these last 15 years of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBeethoven was the grandson of Ludwig van Beethoven (1712ÿ73), a musician from the town of Mechelen in the Duchy of Brabant in the Flemish region of what is now Belgium, who at the age of twenty moved to Bonn.[2][3] Ludwig (he adopted the German cognate of the Dutch Lodewijk) was employed as a bass singer at the court of the Elector of Cologne, eventually rising to become, in 1761, Kapellmeister (music director) and thereafter the pre-eminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life remained proudly displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage.[4] Ludwig had one son, Johann (1740ÿ1792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and violin lessons to supplement his income.[2] Johann married Maria Magdalena Keverich in 1767; she was the daughter of Johann Heinrich Keverich (1701ÿ1751), who had been the head chef at the court of the Archbishopric of Trier.[5]\\r\\nBeethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn. There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; however, the registry of his baptism, in a Catholic service at the Parish of St. Regius on 17?December 1770, survives.[6] As children of that era were traditionally baptised the day after birth in the Catholic Rhine country, and it is known that Beethoven's family and his teacher Johann Albrechtsberger celebrated his birthday on 16?December, most scholars accept 16?December 1770 as Beethoven's date of birth.[7][8] Of the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy. Kaspar Anton Karl was born on 8?April 1774, and Nikolaus Johann, the youngest, was born on 2?October 1776.[9]\\r\\nBeethoven's first music teacher was his father. He later had other local teachers: the court organist Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer (a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition), and Franz Rovantini (a relative, who instructed him in playing the violin and viola).[2] From the outset his tuition regime, which began in his fifth year, was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears; with the involvement of the insomniac Pfeiffer there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven being dragged from his bed to the keyboard.[10] Beethoven's musical talent was obvious at a young age. Johann, aware of Leopold Mozart's successes in this area (with his son Wolfgang and daughter Nannerl), attempted to promote his son as a child prodigy, claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for Beethoven's first public performance in March 1778.[11]\\r\\nSome time after 1779, Beethoven began his studies with his most important teacher in Bonn, Christian Gottlob Neefe, who was appointed the Court's Organist in that year.[12] Neefe taught Beethoven composition, and by March 1783 had helped him write his first published composition: a set of keyboard variations (WoO 63).[9] Beethoven soon began working with Neefe as assistant organist, at first unpaid (1781), and then as a paid employee (1784) of the court chapel conducted by the Kapellmeister Andrea Luchesi. His first three piano sonatas, named \\"Kurfrst\\" (\\"Elector\\") for their dedication to the Elector Maximilian Friedrich (1708ÿ1784), were published in 1783. Maximilian Frederick noticed Beethoven's talent early, and subsidised and encouraged the young man's musical studies.[13]\\r\\nMaximilian Frederick's successor as the Elector of Bonn was Maximilian Francis, the youngest son of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, and he brought notable changes to Bonn. Echoing changes made in Vienna by his brother Joseph, he introduced reforms based on Enlightenment philosophy, with increased support for education and the arts. The teenage Beethoven was almost certainly influenced by these changes. He may also have been influenced at this time by ideas prominent in freemasonry, as Neefe and others around Beethoven were members of the local chapter of the Order of the Illuminati.[14]\\r\\nIn March 1787 Beethoven travelled to Vienna, possibly at another's expense, for the first time, apparently in the hope of studying with Mozart. The details of their relationship are uncertain, including whether they actually met.[15] Having learned that his mother was ill, Beethoven returned about two weeks after his arrival in Vienna. His mother died shortly thereafter, and his father lapsed deeper into alcoholism. As a result, Beethoven became responsible for the care of his two younger brothers, and spent the next five years in Bonn.[16]\\r\\nBeethoven was introduced in these years to several people who became important in his life. Franz Wegeler, a young medical student, introduced him to the von Breuning family (one of whose daughters Wegeler eventually married). Beethoven often visited the von Breuning household, where he taught piano to some of the children. Here he encountered German and classical literature. The von Breuning family environment was less stressful than his own, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline.[17] Beethoven also came to the attention of Count Ferdinand von Waldstein, who became a lifelong friend and financial supporter.[18]\\r\\nIn 1789 Beethoven obtained a legal order by which half of his father's salary was paid directly to him for support of the family.[19] He also contributed further to the family's income by playing viola in the court orchestra. This familiarised Beethoven with a variety of operas, including three by Mozart that were performed at court in this period. He also befriended Anton Reicha, a flautist and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra's conductor, Josef Reicha.[20]\\r\\nFrom 1790 to 1792, Beethoven composed a significant number of works (none were published at the time, and most are now listed as works without opus number) that demonstrated his growing range and maturity. Musicologists have identified a theme similar to those of his Third Symphony in a set of variations written in 1791.[21] It was probably on Neefe's recommendation that Beethoven received his first commissions. The municipal leaders in Bonn had commissioned cantatas to mark the occasion of the death in 1790 of Franz Joseph II and the subsequent accession of Leopold II as Holy Roman Emperor. The two Emperor Cantatas (WoO 87, WoO 88) Beethoven scored were never performed at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s. But they were, according to Brahms, distinctively \\"Beethoven through and through\\" and as such prophetic of the tragic style which would mark his music as distinct from the classical tradition.[22]\\r\\nBeethoven was probably first introduced to Joseph Haydn in late 1790, when the latter was travelling to London and stopped in Bonn around Christmas time.[23] A year and a half later, they met in Bonn on Haydn's return trip from London to Vienna in July 1792, and it is likely that arrangements were made at that time for Beethoven to study with the old master.[24]\\r\\nWith the Elector's help, Beethoven left Bonn for Vienna in November 1792, amid rumours of war spilling out of France; he learned shortly after his arrival that his father had died.[25][26][27] Mozart had also recently died. Count Waldstein, in his farewell note to Beethoven, wrote: \\"Through uninterrupted diligence you will receive Mozart's spirit through Haydn's hands.\\"[27] Over the next few years, Beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying that master's work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartean flavour.[28]\\r\\nBeethoven did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer, but rather devoted himself to study and performance. Working under Haydn's direction,[29] he sought to master counterpoint. He also studied violin under Ignaz Schuppanzigh.[30] Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from Antonio Salieri, primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly 1809.[31] With Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with Johann Albrechtsberger and other teachers. Although his stipend from the Elector expired, a number of Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz, Prince Karl Lichnowsky, and Baron Gottfried van Swieten.[32]\\r\\nBy 1793, Beethoven had established a reputation as an improviser in the salons of the nobility, often playing the preludes and fugues of J. S. Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier.[33] His friend Nikolaus Simrock had begun publishing his compositions; the first are believed to be a set of variations (WoO 66).[34] By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their publication in 1795 would have greater impact.[32] Beethoven's first public performance in Vienna was in March 1795, a concert in which he first performed one of his piano concertos. It is uncertain whether this was the First or Second. Documentary evidence is unclear, and both concertos were in a similar state of near-completion (neither was completed or published for several years).[35][36] Shortly after this performance, he arranged for the publication of the first of his compositions to which he assigned an opus number, the three piano trios, Opus 1. These works were dedicated to his patron Prince Lichnowsky,[35] and were a financial success; Beethoven's profits were nearly sufficient to cover his living expenses for a year.[37]\\r\\nBeethoven composed his first six string quartets (Op. 18) between 1798 and 1800 (commissioned by, and dedicated to, Prince Lobkowitz). They were published in 1801. With premieres of his First and Second Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, Beethoven became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. He also continued to write in other forms, turning out widely known piano sonatas like the \\"Pathtique\\" sonata (Op. 13), which Cooper describes as \\"surpass[ing] any of his previous compositions, in strength of character, depth of emotion, level of originality, and ingenuity of motivic and tonal manipulation.\\"[38] He also completed his Septet (Op. 20) in 1799, which was one of his most popular works during his lifetime.\\r\\nFor the premiere of his First Symphony, Beethoven hired the Burgtheater on 2?April 1800, and staged an extensive programme of music, including works by Haydn and Mozart, as well as his Septet, the First Symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished). The concert, which the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung described as \\"the most interesting concert in a long time,\\" was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that \\"the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist.\\"[39]\\r\\nMozart and Haydn were undeniable influences. For example, Beethoven's quintet for piano and winds is said to bear a strong resemblance to Mozart's work for the same configuration, albeit with his own distinctive touches.[40] But Beethoven's melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published.[41] By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.[42]\\r\\nIn May 1799, Beethoven taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik. During this time, Beethoven fell in love with the younger daughter Josephine[43] who has therefore been identified as one of the more likely candidates for the addressee of his letter to the \\"Immortal Beloved\\" (in 1812). Shortly after these lessons, Josephine was married to Count Josef Deym. Beethoven was a regular visitor at their house, continuing to teach Josephine, and playing at parties and concerts. Her marriage was by all accounts happy (despite initial financial problems),[44] and the couple had four children. Her relationship with Beethoven intensified after Deym died suddenly in 1804.[45]\\r\\nBeethoven had few other students. From 1801 to 1805, he tutored Ferdinand Ries, who went on to become a composer and later wrote Beethoven remembered, a book about their encounters. The young Carl Czerny studied with Beethoven from 1801 to 1803. Czerny went on to become a renowned music teacher himself, instructing Franz Liszt, and gave on 11 February 1812 the Vienna premiere of Beethoven's fifth piano concerto (the \\"Emperor\\").[46]\\r\\nBeethoven's compositions between 1800 and 1802 were dominated by two large-scale orchestral works, although he continued to produce other important works such as the piano sonata Sonata quasi una fantasia known as the \\"Moonlight Sonata\\". In the spring of 1801 he completed The Creatures of Prometheus, a ballet. The work received numerous performances in 1801 and 1802, and Beethoven rushed to publish a piano arrangement to capitalise on its early popularity.[47] In the spring of 1802 he completed the Second Symphony, intended for performance at a concert that was cancelled. The symphony received its premiere instead at a subscription concert in April 1803 at the Theater an der Wien, where Beethoven had been appointed composer in residence. In addition to the Second Symphony, the concert also featured the First Symphony, the Third Piano Concerto, and the oratorio Christ on the Mount of Olives. Reviews were mixed, but the concert was a financial success; Beethoven was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket.[48]\\r\\nBeethoven's business dealings with publishers also began to improve in 1802 when his brother Kaspar, who had previously assisted him casually, began to assume a larger role in the management of his affairs. In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, Kaspar also began selling some of Beethoven's earlier unpublished works, and encouraged Beethoven (against the latter's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations. Beethoven acceded to these requests, as he could not prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his works.[49]\\r\\nBeethoven is reported to have dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798 induced by a rage at the interruption of his workhaving fallen over, he got up to find himself deaf. His hearing only ever partially recovered and, during its gradual decline, was impeded by a severe form of tinnitus.[50] As early as 1801, he wrote to friends describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the problems).[51]\\r\\nThe cause of Beethoven's deafness is unknown, but has variously been attributed to typhus, auto-immune disorders (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), and even his habit of immersing his head in cold water to stay awake.[52] The explanation from Beethoven's autopsy was that he had a \\"distended inner ear,\\" which developed lesions over time.[citation needed]\\r\\nBeethoven, on the advice of his doctor, lived in the small Austrian town of Heiligenstadt, just outside Vienna, from April to October 1802 in an attempt to come to terms with his condition. There he wrote his Heiligenstadt Testament, a letter to his brothers which records his thoughts of suicide due to his growing deafness and records his resolution to continue living for and through his art.[53] Over time, his hearing loss became profound: at the end of the premiere of his Ninth Symphony in 1824, he had to be turned around to see the tumultuous applause of the audience because he could hear neither it nor the orchestra. Beethoven's hearing loss did not prevent him from composing music, but it made playing at concertsa lucrative source of incomeincreasingly difficult. After a failed attempt in 1811 to perform his own Piano Concerto No. 5 (the \\"Emperor\\"), which was premiered by his student Carl Czerny, he never performed in public again until he directed the premiere performance of the Ninth Symphony in 1824, which involved him giving cues to conductor Michael Umlauf.[54]\\r\\nA large collection of Beethoven's hearing aids, such as a special ear horn, can be viewed at the Beethoven House Museum in Bonn, Germany. Despite his obvious distress, Czerny remarked that Beethoven could still hear speech and music normally until 1812.[55] Around 1814 however, by the age of 44, Beethoven was almost totally deaf, and when a group of visitors saw him play a loud arpeggio of thundering bass notes at his piano remarking, \\"Ist es nicht sch?n?\\" (Is it not beautiful?), they felt deep sympathy considering his courage and sense of humour (he lost the ability to hear higher frequencies first).[56]\\r\\nAs a result of Beethoven's hearing loss, his conversation books are an unusually rich written resource. Used primarily in the last ten or so years of his life, his friends wrote in these books so that he could know what they were saying, and he then responded either orally or in the book. The books contain discussions about music and other matters, and give insights into Beethoven's thinking; they are a source for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed, and also his perception of his relationship to art. Out of a total of 400 conversation books, it has been suggested that 264 were destroyed (and others were altered) after Beethoven's death by his secretary Anton Schindler, who wished only an idealised biography of the composer to survive.[57] However, Theodore Albrecht contests the verity of Schindler's destruction of a large number of conversation books.[58]\\r\\nWhile Beethoven earned income from publication of his works and from public performances, he also depended on the generosity of patrons for income, for whom he gave private performances and copies of works they commissioned for an exclusive period prior to their publication. Some of his early patrons, including Prince Lobkowitz and Prince Lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works.[59]\\r\\nPerhaps Beethoven's most important aristocratic patron was Archduke Rudolph, the youngest son of Emperor Leopold II, who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with Beethoven. The cleric (Cardinal-Priest) and the composer became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824.[60] Beethoven dedicated 14 compositions to Rudolph, including the Archduke Trio (1811) and Missa solemnis (1823). Rudolph, in turn, dedicated one of his own compositions to Beethoven. The letters Beethoven wrote to Rudolph are today kept at the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna.[61] Another patron was Count (later Prince) Andreas Razumovsky, for whom the String Quartets Nos. 7ÿ9, Op. 59, Rasumovsky were named.\\r\\nIn the autumn of 1808, after having been rejected for a position at the royal theatre, Beethoven received an offer from Napoleon's brother Jr?me Bonaparte, then king of Westphalia, for a well-paid position as Kapellmeister at the court in Cassel. To persuade him to stay in Vienna, the Archduke Rudolph, Prince Kinsky and Prince Lobkowitz, after receiving representations from the composer's friends, pledged to pay Beethoven a pension of 4000 florins a year. Only Archduke Rudolph paid his share of the pension on the agreed date.[62] Kinsky, immediately called to military duty, did not contribute and soon died after falling from his horse. Lobkowitz stopped paying in September 1811. No successors came forward to continue the patronage, and Beethoven relied mostly on selling composition rights and a small pension after 1815. The effects of these financial arrangements were undermined to some extent by war with France, which caused significant inflation when the government printed money to fund its war efforts.[citation needed]\\r\\nBeethoven's return to Vienna from Heiligenstadt was marked by a change in musical style, and is now designated as the start of his middle or \\"heroic\\" period. According to Carl Czerny, Beethoven said, \\"I am not satisfied with the work I have done so far. From now on I intend to take a new way.\\"[63] This \\"heroic\\" phase was characterised by a large number of original works composed on a grand scale.[64] The first major work employing this new style was the Third Symphony in E flat, known as the Eroica. This work was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony. When it premiered in early 1805 it received a mixed reception. Some listeners objected to its length or misunderstood its structure, while others viewed it as a masterpiece.[65]\\r\\nThe \\"middle period\\" is sometimes associated with a \\"heroic\\" manner of composing,[66] but the use of the term \\"heroic\\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship. The term is more frequently used as an alternative name for the middle period.[67] The appropriateness of the term \\"heroic\\" to describe the whole middle period has been questioned as well: while some works, like the Third and Fifth Symphonies, are easy to describe as \\"heroic\\", many others, like his Symphony No. 6, Pastoral, are not.[68]\\r\\nSome of the middle period works extend the musical language Beethoven had inherited from Haydn and Mozart. The middle period work includes the Third through Eighth Symphonies, the Rasumovsky, Harp and Serioso string quartets, the Waldstein and Appassionata piano sonatas, Christ on the Mount of Olives, the opera Fidelio, the Violin Concerto and many other compositions. During this time Beethoven's income came from publishing his works, from performances of them, and from his patrons. His position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on Fidelio, his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian censor, and finally premiered in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the French occupation of the city. In addition to being a financial failure, this version of Fidelio was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it.[69]\\r\\nDuring May 1809, when the attacking forces of Napoleon bombarded Vienna, according to Ferdinand Ries, Beethoven, very worried that the noise would destroy what remained of his hearing, hid in the basement of his brother's house, covering his ears with pillows.[70]\\r\\nThe work of the middle period established Beethoven as a master. In a review from 1810, he was enshrined by E. T. A. Hoffmann as one of the three great \\"Romantic\\" composers; Hoffman called Beethoven's Fifth Symphony \\"one of the most important works of the age.\\"\\r\\nBeethoven's love life was hampered by class issues. In late 1801 he met a young countess, Julie (\\"Giulietta\\") Guicciardi through the Brunsvik family, at a time when he was giving regular piano lessons to Josephine Brunsvik. Beethoven mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to his boyhood friend, Franz Wegeler, but he could not consider marrying her, due to the class difference. Beethoven later dedicated to her his Sonata No. 14, now commonly known as the Moonlight sonata or Mondscheinsonate (in German).[71]\\r\\nHis relationship with Josephine Brunsvik deepened after the death in 1804 of her aristocratic first husband, the Count Joseph Deym. Beethoven wrote Josephine 15 passionate love letters from late 1804 to around 1809/10. Although his feelings were obviously reciprocated, Josephine was forced by her family to withdraw from him in 1807. She cited her \\"duty\\" and the fact that she would have lost the custodianship of her aristocratic children had she married a commoner.[72] After Josephine married Baron von Stackelberg in 1810, Beethoven may have proposed unsuccessfully to Therese Malfatti, the supposed dedicatee of \\"Fr Elise\\";[73][74] his status as a commoner may again have interfered with those plans.\\r\\nIn the spring of 1811 Beethoven became seriously ill, suffering headaches and high fever. On the advice of his doctor, he spent six weeks in the Bohemian spa town of Teplitz. The following winter, which was dominated by work on the Seventh symphony, he was again ill, and his doctor ordered him to spend the summer of 1812 at the spa Teplitz. It is certain that he was at Teplitz when he wrote a love letter to his \\"Immortal Beloved\\".[75] The identity of the intended recipient has long been a subject of debate; candidates include Julie Guicciardi, Therese Malfatti, Josephine Brunsvik, and Antonie Brentano.\\r\\nBeethoven visited his brother Johann at the end of October 1812. He wished to end Johann's cohabitation with Therese Obermayer, a woman who already had an illegitimate child. He was unable to convince Johann to end the relationship and appealed to the local civic and religious authorities. Johann and Therese married on 9?November.[76]\\r\\nIn early 1813 Beethoven apparently went through a difficult emotional period, and his compositional output dropped. His personal appearance degradedit had generally been neatas did his manners in public, especially when dining. Beethoven took care of his brother (who was suffering from tuberculosis) and his family, an expense that he claimed left him penniless.\\r\\nBeethoven was finally motivated to begin significant composition again in June 1813, when news arrived of the defeat of one of Napoleon's armies at Vitoria, Spain, by a coalition of forces under the Duke of Wellington. This news stimulated him to write the battle symphony known as Wellington's Victory. It was first performed on 8?December, along with his Seventh Symphony, at a charity concert for victims of the war. The work was a popular hit, probably because of its programmatic style, which was entertaining and easy to understand. It received repeat performances at concerts Beethoven staged in January and February 1814. Beethoven's renewed popularity led to demands for a revival of Fidelio, which, in its third revised version, was also well received at its July opening. That summer he composed a piano sonata for the first time in five years (No. 27, Opus 90). This work was in a markedly more Romantic style than his earlier sonatas. He was also one of many composers who produced music in a patriotic vein to entertain the many heads of state and diplomats who came to the Congress of Vienna that began in November 1814. His output of songs included his only song cycle, \\"An die ferne Geliebte,\\" and the extraordinarily expressive second setting of the poem \\"An die Hoffnung\\" (Op. 94) in 1815. Compared to its first setting in 1805 (a gift for Josephine Brunsvik), it was \\"far more dramatic?... The entire spirit is that of an operatic scena.\\"[77]\\r\\nBetween 1815 and 1817 Beethoven's output dropped again. Beethoven attributed part of this to a lengthy illness (he called it an \\"inflammatory fever\\") that afflicted him for more than a year, starting in October 1816.[78] Biographers have speculated on a variety of other reasons that also contributed to the decline, including the difficulties in the personal lives of his would-be paramours and the harsh censorship policies of the Austrian government. The illness and death of his brother Kaspar from tuberculosis may also have played a role.\\r\\nKaspar had been ill for some time, and Beethoven spent a small fortune in 1815 on his care. After Kaspar died on 15?November 1815, Beethoven immediately became embroiled in a protracted legal dispute with Kaspar's wife Johanna over custody of their son Karl?(de), then nine years old. Beethoven, who considered Johanna an unfit parent because of her morals (she had an illegitimate child by a different father before marrying Kaspar and had been convicted of theft) and financial management, had successfully applied to Kaspar to have himself named sole guardian of the boy. A late codicil to Kaspar's will gave him and Johanna joint guardianship. While Beethoven was successful at having his nephew removed from her custody in February 1816, the case was not fully resolved until 1820, and he was frequently preoccupied by the demands of the litigation and seeing to the welfare of Karl, whom he first placed in a private school.\\r\\nThe Austrian court system had one court for the nobility and members of the Landtafel, the Landrechte, and many other courts for commoners, among them the Civil Court of the Vienna Magistrate. Beethoven disguised the fact that the Dutch \\"van\\" in his name did not denote nobility as does the German \\"von\\"[79] and his case was tried in the Landrechte. Owing to his influence with the court, Beethoven felt assured of the favourable outcome of being awarded sole guardianship. While giving evidence to the Landrechte, however, Beethoven was unable to prove being of noble birth[79] and as a consequence, on 18?December 1818 the case was transferred to the Magistracy, where he lost sole guardianship.\\r\\nBeethoven appealed and regained custody. Johanna's appeal to the Emperor was not successful: the Emperor \\"washed his hands of the matter.\\" During the years of custody that followed, Beethoven attempted to ensure that Karl lived to the highest moral standards. Beethoven had an overbearing manner and frequently interfered in his nephew's life. Karl attempted suicide on 31?July 1826 by shooting himself in the head. He survived and was brought to his mother's house, where he recuperated. He and Beethoven were reconciled, but Karl insisted on joining the army and last saw Beethoven in January 1827.[80]\\r\\nBeethoven began a renewed study of older music, including works by J. S. Bach and Handel, that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions. He composed the overture The Consecration of the House, which was the first work to attempt to incorporate these influences. A new style emerged, now called his \\"late period\\". He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period are commonly held to include the last five piano sonatas and the Diabelli Variations, the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the Missa Solemnis and the Ninth Symphony.[citation needed]\\r\\nBy early 1818 Beethoven's health had improved, and his nephew moved in with him in January. On the downside, his hearing had deteriorated to the point that conversation became difficult, necessitating the use of conversation books. His household management had also improved somewhat; Nanette Streicher, who had assisted in his care during his illness, continued to provide some support, and he finally found a skilled cook.[81] His musical output in 1818 was still somewhat reduced, but included song collections and the \\"Hammerklavier\\" Sonata, as well as sketches for two symphonies that eventually coalesced into the epic Ninth. In 1819 he was again preoccupied by the legal processes around Karl, and began work on the Diabelli Variations and the Missa Solemnis.[citation needed]\\r\\nFor the next few years he continued to work on the Missa, composing piano sonatas and bagatelles to satisfy the demands of publishers and the need for income, and completing the Diabelli Variations. He was ill again for an extended time in 1821, and completed the Missa in 1823, three years after its original due date. He also opened discussions with his publishers over the possibility of producing a complete edition of his work, an idea that was arguably not fully realised until 1971.[citation needed] Beethoven's brother Johann began to take a hand in his business affairs, much in the way Kaspar had earlier, locating older unpublished works to offer for publication and offering the Missa to multiple publishers with the goal of getting a higher price for it.[citation needed]\\r\\nTwo commissions in 1822 improved Beethoven's financial prospects. The Philharmonic Society of London offered a commission for a symphony, and Prince Nikolas Golitsin of St. Petersburg offered to pay Beethoven's price for three string quartets. The first of these commissions spurred Beethoven to finish the Ninth Symphony, which was first performed, along with the Missa Solemnis, on 7?May 1824, to great acclaim at the K?rntnertortheater. The Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung gushed, \\"inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world,\\" and Carl Czerny wrote that his symphony \\"breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit?... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads.\\" Unlike his more lucrative earlier concerts, this did not make Beethoven much money, as the expenses of mounting it were significantly higher.[82] A second concert on 24?May, in which the producer guaranteed Beethoven a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that \\"many people [had] already gone into the country.\\" It was Beethoven's last public concert.[83]\\r\\nBeethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Golitsin. This series of quartets, known as the \\"Late Quartets,\\" went far beyond what musicians or audiences were ready for at that time. One musician[who?] commented that \\"we know there is something there, but we do not know what it is.\\" Composer Louis Spohr called them \\"indecipherable, uncorrected horrors.\\" Opinion has changed considerably from the time of their first bewildered reception: their forms and ideas inspired musicians and composers including Richard Wagner and Bla Bart܇k, and continue to do so. Of the late quartets, Beethoven's favourite was the Fourteenth Quartet, op. 131 in C? minor, which he rated as his most perfect single work.[84] The last musical wish of Schubert was to hear the Op. 131 quartet, which he did on 14 November 1828, five days before his death.[85]\\r\\nBeethoven wrote the last quartets amidst failing health. In April 1825 he was bedridden, and remained ill for about a month. The illnessor more precisely, his recovery from itis remembered for having given rise to the deeply felt slow movement of the Fifteenth Quartet, which Beethoven called \\"Holy song of thanks ('Heiliger Dankgesang') to the divinity, from one made well.\\" He went on to complete the quartets now numbered Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Sixteenth. The last work completed by Beethoven was the substitute final movement of the Thirteenth Quartet, which replaced the difficult Gro?e Fuge. Shortly thereafter, in December 1826, illness struck again, with episodes of vomiting and diarrhoea that nearly ended his life.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1825, his nine symphonies were performed in a cycle for the first time, by the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra under Johann Philipp Christian Schulz. This was repeated in 1826.[86][87]\\r\\nBeethoven was bedridden for most of his remaining months, and many friends came to visit. He died on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56 during a thunderstorm. His friend Anselm Httenbrenner, who was present at the time, said that there was a peal of thunder at the moment of death. An autopsy revealed significant liver damage, which may have been due to heavy alcohol consumption.[88] It also revealed considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves.[89]\\r\\nBeethoven's funeral procession on 29?March 1827 was attended by an estimated 20,000 Viennese citizens. Franz Schubert, who died the following year and was buried next to Beethoven, was one of the torchbearers. Beethoven was buried in a dedicated grave in the W?hring cemetery, north-west of Vienna, after a requiem mass at the church of the Holy Trinity (Dreifaltigkeitskirche). His remains were exhumed for study in 1862, and moved in 1888 to Vienna's Zentralfriedhof.[88] In 2012, his crypt was checked to see if his teeth had been stolen during a series of grave robberies of other famous Viennese composers.[90]\\r\\nThere is dispute about the cause of Beethoven's death: alcoholic cirrhosis, syphilis, infectious hepatitis, lead poisoning, sarcoidosis and Whipple's disease have all been proposed.[91] Friends and visitors before and after his death clipped locks of his hair, some of which have been preserved and subjected to additional analysis, as have skull fragments removed during the 1862 exhumation.[92] Some of these analyses have led to controversial assertions that Beethoven was accidentally poisoned to death by excessive doses of lead-based treatments administered under instruction from his doctor.[93][94][95]\\r\\nBeethoven is acknowledged as one of the giants of classical music; he is occasionally referred to as one of the \\"three Bs\\" (along with Bach and Brahms) who epitomise that tradition. Without abandoning the fundamental tenets of 18th century musical Classicism himself, he nonetheless pointed the way towards 19th century Romanticism by means of paradigm-shifting artistic innovation, and his influence on subsequent generations of composers was profound.[96] His music features twice on the Voyager Golden Record, a phonograph record containing a broad sample of the images, common sounds, languages, and music of Earth, sent into outer space with the two Voyager probes.[97]\\r\\nBeethoven composed in several musical genres and for a variety of instrument combinations. His works for symphony orchestra include nine symphonies (of which the Ninth Symphony includes a chorus), and about a dozen pieces of \\"occasional\\" music. He wrote seven concerti for one or more soloists and orchestra, as well as four shorter works that include soloists accompanied by orchestra. His only opera is Fidelio; other vocal works with orchestral accompaniment include two masses and a number of shorter works.\\r\\nHis large body of compositions for piano includes 32 piano sonatas and numerous shorter pieces, including arrangements of some of his other works. Works with piano accompaniment include 10 violin sonatas, 5 cello sonatas, and a sonata for French horn, as well as numerous lieder.\\r\\nBeethoven also wrote a significant quantity of chamber music. In addition to 16 string quartets, he wrote five works for string quintet, seven for piano trio, five for string trio, and more than a dozen works for various combinations of wind instruments.\\r\\nBeethoven's compositional career is usually divided into early, middle, and late periods.[96] In this scheme, his early period is taken to last until about 1802, the middle period from about 1803 to about 1814, and the late period from about 1815.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn his early period, Beethoven's work was strongly influenced by his predecessors Haydn and Mozart. He also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the first and second symphonies, the set of six string quartets Opus 18, the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so piano sonatas, including the famous Pathtique sonata, Op. 13.\\r\\nHis middle (heroic) period began shortly after Beethoven's personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3ÿ8), the last three piano concertos, the Triple Concerto and violin concerto, five string quartets (Nos. 7ÿ11), several piano sonatas (including the Moonlight, Waldstein and Appassionata sonatas), the Kreutzer violin sonata and Beethoven's only opera, Fidelio.\\r\\nBeethoven's late period began around 1815. Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The String Quartet, Op. 131 has seven linked movements, and the Ninth Symphony adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.[96] Other compositions from this period include the Missa Solemnis, the last five string quartets (including the massive Gro?e Fuge) and the last five piano sonatas.\\r\\nBeethoven's personal life was troubled by his encroaching deafness and irritability brought on by chronic abdominal pain (beginning in his twenties), which led him to contemplate suicide (documented in his Heiligenstadt Testament). Beethoven was often irascible. It has been suggested he had bipolar disorder.[98] Nevertheless, he had a close and devoted circle of friends all his life, thought to have been attracted by his strength of personality. Towards the end of his life, Beethoven's friends competed in their efforts to help him cope with his incapacities.[96]\\r\\nSources show Beethoven's disdain for authority and for social rank. He stopped performing at the piano if the audience chatted amongst themselves, or afforded him less than their full attention. At soires, he refused to perform if suddenly called upon to do so. Eventually, after many confrontations, the Archduke Rudolph decreed that the usual rules of court etiquette did not apply to Beethoven.[96]\\r\\nBeethoven was attracted to the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment. In 1804, when Napoleon's imperial ambitions became clear, Beethoven took hold of the title page of his Third Symphony and scratched the name Bonaparte out so violently that he made a hole in the paper. He later changed the work's title to \\"Sinfonia Eroica, composta per festeggiare il sovvenire d'un grand'uom\\" (\\"Heroic Symphony, composed to celebrate the memory of a great man\\"), and he rededicated it to his patron, Prince Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz, at whose palace it was first performed.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe fourth movement of his Ninth Symphony features an elaborate choral setting of Schiller's Ode An die Freude (\\"Ode to Joy\\"), an optimistic hymn championing the brotherhood of humanity.\\r\\nBeethoven has been the subject of a number of biographical films; see Beethoven in film.\\r\\nBeethoven's Tenth is a play in two acts by actor Peter Ustinov. The first performances in the US were between 7 October and 27 November 1983, with Ustinov himself playing the leading role and supporting actors including George Rose.[99]\\r\\nThe Beethoven Monument, Bonn, was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of his 75th anniversary. It was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the very hasty construction of the original Beethovenhalle in Bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of Franz Liszt). A statue to Mozart had been unveiled in Salzburg, Austria in 1842. Vienna did not honour Beethoven with a statue until 1880.[100] His is the only name inscribed on one of the plaques that trim Symphony Hall, Boston; the others were left empty because it was felt that only Beethoven's popularity would endure.[101]\\r\\nThere is a museum, the Beethoven House, the place of his birth, in central Bonn. The same city has hosted a musical festival, the Beethovenfest, since 1845. The festival was initially irregular but has been organised annually since 2007.\\r\\nThe Ira F.

It was included in Frost's third collection of poetry Mountain Interval, which was published in 1916. Consisting of 59 lines, it is one of Robert Frost's most anthologized poems. Along with other poems that deal with rural landscape and wildlife, it shows Frost as a nature poet.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrost's writing of this poem was inspired by another similar poem \\"Swinging on a Birch-tree\\" by American poet Lucy Larcom and his own experience of swinging birch trees at his childhood.[2] Frost once said \\"it was almost sacrilegious climbing a birch tree till it bent, till it gave and swooped to the ground, but that's what boys did in those days\\".[3] Written in 1913-1914, \\"Birches\\" first appeared in Atlantic Monthly in the August issue of 1915 and was later collected in Frost's third book Mountain Interval (1916).[2][4]\\r\\nBirches\\r\\nWhen I see birches bend to left and right\\r\\nAcross the lines of straighter darker trees,\\r\\nI like to think some boy's been swinging them.\\r\\nBut swinging doesn't bend them down to stay\\r\\nAs ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them\\r\\nLoaded with ice a sunny winter morning\\r\\nAfter a rain. They click upon themselves\\r\\nAs the breeze rises, and turn many-colored\\r\\nAs the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.\\r\\nSoon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells\\r\\nShattering and avalanching on the snow-crust\\r\\nSuch heaps of broken glass to sweep away\\r\\nYou'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.\\r\\nThey are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,\\r\\nAnd they seem not to break; though once they are bowed\\r\\nSo low for long, they never right themselves:\\r\\nYou may see their trunks arching in the woods\\r\\nYears afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground\\r\\nLike girls on hands and knees that throw their hair\\r\\nBefore them over their heads to dry in the sun.\\r\\nBut I was going to say when Truth broke in\\r\\nWith all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm\\r\\nI should prefer to have some boy bend them\\r\\nAs he went out and in to fetch the cows\\r\\nSome boy too far from town to learn baseball,\\r\\nWhose only play was what he found himself,\\r\\nSummer or winter, and could play alone.\\r\\nOne by one he subdued his father's trees\\r\\nBy riding them down over and over again\\r\\nUntil he took the stiffness out of them,\\r\\nAnd not one but hung limp, not one was left\\r\\nFor him to conquer. He learned all there was\\r\\nTo learn about not launching out too soon\\r\\nAnd so not carrying the tree away\\r\\nClear to the ground. He always kept his poise\\r\\nTo the top branches, climbing carefully\\r\\nWith the same pains you use to fill a cup\\r\\nUp to the brim, and even above the brim.\\r\\nThen he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,\\r\\nKicking his way down through the air to the ground.\\r\\nSo was I once myself a swinger of birches.\\r\\nAnd so I dream of going back to be.\\r\\nIt's when I'm weary of considerations,\\r\\nAnd life is too much like a pathless wood\\r\\nWhere your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs\\r\\nBroken across it, and one eye is weeping\\r\\nFrom a twig's having lashed across it open.\\r\\nI'd like to get away from earth awhile\\r\\nAnd then come back to it and begin over.\\r\\nMay no fate willfully misunderstand me\\r\\nAnd half grant what I wish and snatch me away\\r\\nNot to return. Earth's the right place for love:\\r\\nI don't know where it's likely to go better.\\r\\nI'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,\\r\\nAnd climb black branches up a snow-white trunk\\r\\nToward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,\\r\\nBut dipped its top and set me down again.\\r\\nThat would be good both going and coming back.\\r\\nOne could do worse than be a swinger of birches.\\r\\nWhen the speaker (the poet himself) sees a row of bent birches in contrast to straight trees, he likes to think that some boy has been swinging them. He then realizes that it was not a boy, rather the ice storms that had bent the birches. On a winter morning, freezing rain covers the branches with ice, which then cracks and falls to the snow-covered ground. The sunlight refracts on the ice crystals, making a brilliant display.\\r\\nWhen the truth strikes the speaker, he still prefers his imagination of a boy swinging and bending the birches. The speaker says he also was a swinger of birches when he was a boy and wishes to be so now. When he becomes weary of this world, and life becomes confused, he would like to go toward heaven by climbing a birch tree and then coming back again, because earth is the right place for love.\\r\\nThis poem is written in blank verse, with a particular emphasis on the sound of sense. For example, when Frost describes the cracking of the ice on the branches, his selections of syllables create a visceral sense of the action taking place: Soon the suns warmth makes them shed crystal shells / Shattering and avalanching on the snow crust  / Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away\\r\\nOriginally, this poem was called Swinging Birches, a title that perhaps provides a more accurate depiction of the subject. In writing this poem, Frost was inspired by his childhood experience with swinging on birches, which was a popular game for children in rural areas of New England during the time. Frosts own children were avid birch swingers, as demonstrated by a selection from his daughter Lesleys journal: On the way home, i climbed up a high birch and came down with it and i stopped in the air about three feet and pap cout me.\\r\\nIn the poem, the act of swinging on birches is presented as a way to escape the hard rationality or Truth of the adult world, if only for a moment. As the boy climbs up the tree, he is climbing toward heaven and a place where his imagination can be free. The narrator explains that climbing a birch is an opportunity to get away from earth awhile / And then come back to it and begin over. A swinger is still grounded in the earth through the roots of the tree as he climbs, but he is able to reach beyond his normal life on the earth and reach for a higher plane of existence.\\r\\nFrost highlights the narrators regret that he can no longer find this peace of mind from swinging on birches. Because he is an adult, he is unable to leave his responsibilities behind and climb toward heaven until he can start fresh on the earth. In fact, the narrator is not even able to enjoy the imagined view of a boy swinging in the birches. In the fourth line of the poem, he is forced to acknowledge the Truth of the birches: the bends are caused by winter storms, not by a boy swinging on them.\\r\\nSignificantly, the narrators desire to escape from the rational world is inconclusive. He wants to escape as a boy climbing toward heaven, but he also wants to return to the earth: both going and coming back. The freedom of imagination is appealing and wondrous, but the narrator still cannot avoid returning to Truth and his responsibilities on the ground; the escape is only a temporary one. The poem is full of ambiguity and it has got a very aesthetic sense to it.\\r\\nWritten in conversational language, the poem constantly moves between imagination and fact, from reverie to reflection. In the opening, the speaker employs an explanation for how the birch trees were bent. He is pleased to think that some boys were swinging them when he is suddenly reminded that it is actually the ice-storm that bends the trees. Thus, the poem makes some shift of thought in its description. An abrupt shift occurs when the speaker yearns to leave this earth because of its confusion and make a heaven-ward journey. But the speaker does not want to die by leaving earth forever. He wants to come back to this earth, because to the speaker, the earth is, though not perfect, a better place for going on. The speaker is not one who is ready to wait for the promise of afterlife. The love expressed here is for life and himself. This shows Frost's agnostic side where heaven is a fragile concept to him.[5] This becomes clear when he says the inner dome of heaven had fallen.\\r\\nRich metaphoric thinking and imagery abound in the poem, where Frost presents some sharp descriptions of natural phenomena.[4]\\r\\nThe poem centers on various themes of balance, youth, spirituality, and the natural world. It deals with the issue of how to reconcile between impulse and caution, between spontaneity and structure. This act of balancing remains a crucial theme in Frost's thought, and his typical suggestion for this is to execute things in a way that requires control and skill ÿ be it a question of climbing and swinging a Birch tree or an act of writing or any other issue of real life. Each of us is disillusioned in life. There are so many problems and troubles that fill us with anxiety and tension. Sometimes we feel highly burdened. So we want an escape from our woes. We want to do something to reach a place of calm and exhilaration. The poet's desire to rise up on the branch of a birch is symptomatic of our desire to escape from the world of harsh realities. But he does not want to remain in the world of fancy forever.

However, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have statutory laws requiring a person receiving a tattoo be 18 years of age or older. This is partially based on the legal principle that a minor cannot enter into a legal contract or otherwise render informed consent for a procedure. Most states permit a person under the age of 18 to receive a tattoo with permission of a parent or guardian, but some states outright prohibit tattooing under a certain age regardless of permission, with the exception of medical necessity (such as markings placed for radiation therapy).\\r\\nIn all jurisdictions, individual tattooists may also choose to place additional restrictions based on their own moral feelings, such as refusing any clients under a specific age even with parental consent despite it being legal, or limiting the type and/or location of where they are willing to tattoo (such as refusing any work around intimate parts of the body). They may additionally refuse to perform specific artwork, including if they merely find it inappropriate or offensive, or refuse to work on a client that they suspect may be intoxicated.

Canada sent its first element of Canadian soldiers secretly in October 2001 from Joint Task Force 2,[1] and the first contingents of regular Canadian troops arrived in Afghanistan in JanuaryÿFebruary 2002. Canada took on a larger role starting in 2006 after the Canadian troops were redeployed to Kandahar province. There were 2,500 Canadian Forces (CF) personnel in Afghanistan and 1,200 comprised the combat battle group.[2] At the 2012 NATO Summit in Chicago, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that an undisclosed number of Canadian soldiers would remain in the country to help train and mentor the Afghan National Army until 12 March 2014 (though Canadian troops ended their combat role there in 2011).\\r\\nIn September 2001 after the 11 September terrorist attacks, Minister of National Defence Art Eggleton advised Governor General Adrienne Clarkson to authorize more than 100 Canadian Forces members serving on military exchange programs in the United States and other countries to participate in U.S. operations in Afghanistan. Eggleton summed up the dominant thinking in the government at the time when he said, \\"Any Canadian military deployment to Afghanistan may well be similar to a situation in Eritrea and Ethiopia where we went in on the first wave, we helped establish the stabilization, the basis for ongoing peace support operations that would come after ... but then turned it over to somebody else.\\"[3] The operations were aimed at identifying and neutralizing al-Qaeda members in that country, as well as toppling the Taliban regime, which was supporting international terrorism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to understand Canada's policy in Afghanistan, a brief history of its foreign policy initiatives is in order. In post-Cold War conflicts, Canada \\"experienced a steepand at times bloodylearning curve as it tried to develop new techniques to contain violence and restore functioning civil societies.\\"[4] After a 15-hour firefight in Croatia involving Canadian troops at a ground known as the Medak Pocket, it became clear that \\"peacekeeping forces had to be able to make that rapid tactical transition. It meant that they had to be trained, equipped, and prepared for combat just as much as they were for peacekeeping.\\"[5] This is reflected in the training and professionalism of the Canadian army mentioned later on the page. Moving to Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti a new peacekeeping partnership began to form. This required the assistance of soldiers and development organizations working hand in hand to achieve their rebuilding goals. These peacekeeping initiatives carried out by \\"Canadians and other NATO troops in Bosnia and elsewhere in the post-Cold War conflicts are similar and relevant to what they are carrying out in Afghanistan. In many respects the peace-building in Kandahar is just one more example of the 'new normal.'\\"[6]\\r\\nGeneral Ray Henault, the Chief of the Defence Staff, issued preliminary orders to several CF units, as Operation Apollo was established. The Canadian commitment was originally planned to last to October 2003.\\r\\nApproximately 40 Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2) assaulters were sent to southern Afghanistan in early December 2001, although the Canadian public was not informed of the deployment, following the American declaration of a War on Terror. However, in Sean M. Maloney's book Enduring the Freedom, it was reported that JTF2 was secretly deployed without Prime Minister Jean Chrtien's permission in early October 2001.[1] (In October 2004, these JTF2 personnel were awarded the US Navy Presidential Unit Citation as part of Task Force K-Bar, a multinational special-operations task force led by the US Navy SEALs that was decorated for its operations during the period 17 October 2001 through 30 March 2002.)\\r\\nRegular forces arrived in Kandahar during JanuaryÿFebruary 2002. In March 2002, three Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry snipers fought alongside U.S. Army units during Operation Anaconda. In the operation the team broke, and re-broke, the kill record for a long distance sniper kill set in the Vietnam War by a U.S. Marine, Staff Sergeant Carlos Hathcock.[7][8] Operation Anaconda was also the first time since the Korean War that Canadian soldiers relieved American soldiers in a combat situation. Canadian forces also undertook Operation Harpoon in the Shah-i-Kot Valley. Other forces in the country provided garrison and security troops.\\r\\nThe Tarnak Farm incident occurred on 18 April 2002, when an American F-16 jet dropped a laser-guided bomb on a group of soldiers from 3rd Battalion PPCLI Battle Group. The soldiers were conducting night-time training on a designated live-fire range, and the American pilots mistook their gunfire for a Taliban insurgent attack. Four Canadians were killed and eight were wounded in the friendly fire incident. Their deaths were the first Canadian deaths in Afghanistan, and the first in a combat zone since the Korean War.[9]\\r\\n3PPCLIBG during Operation Cherokee Sky north of Qalat, July 2002.\\r\\n3PPCLIBG during Operation Cherokee Sky north of Qalat, July 2002.\\r\\n3PPCLIBG during Operation Cherokee Sky north of Qalat, July 2002.\\r\\nSoldiers from the 293rd MP Company, 97th MP Bn., along with a Royal Canadian Mounted Police element, search a ridge of the Sur Ghar Mountain Range behind a police sub-station, May 7, for sign of Taliban presence following an enemy attack on the sub-station, April 29. No coalition troops were killed or wounded during the attack.\\r\\nIn August 2003, the Canadian Forces moved to the northern city of Kabul where it became the commanding nation of the newly formed International Security Assistance Force. Canada dubbed this Operation Athena and a 1,900-strong Canadian task force provided assistance to civilian infrastructure such as well-digging and repair of local buildings.\\r\\nIn March 2004, Canada committed $250 million in aid to Afghanistan, and $5 million to support the 2004 Afghan election.[10]\\r\\nOn 13 February 2005, Defence Minister Bill Graham announced Canada was doubling the number of troops in Afghanistan by the coming summer, from 600 troops in Kabul to 1200.[11]\\r\\nIn spring 2005 it was announced that the Canadian Forces would move back to the volatile Kandahar Province as the U.S. forces handed command to the Canadians in the region. Operation Athena ended in December 2005 and the fulfillment of the stated aim of \\"rebuilding the democratic process\\" in Afghanistan.[12]\\r\\nMission-specific training has been part of a Canadian soldier's preparation for service on peacekeeping and stability operations since the 1960s. This plays a huge part in the war in Afghanistan. In preparations, \\"soldiers needed to know as much as possible about local customs, culture, and politics, and about the nature and motivation of groups that might oppose the establishment of peace and order.\\"[13] This, accompanied with psychological triaging with a soldier's family, made this deployment of Canadian forces the most ever prepared overseas. In training for the mission the goal in Afghanistan was clear: The Afghan mission would only succeed when the Government of Afghanistan could provide for the needs of its people.[13] It was this notion that shaped the Canadian and NATO approach toward reconstructing the Afghan society.\\r\\nOperation Archer followed Athena beginning in February 2006. Unlike the ISAF-led ATHENA, ARCHER was part of the American military command. By the spring of 2006, Canada had a major role in southern Afghanistan, with Task Force Afghanistan being a battle group of 2,300 soldiers based at Kandahar. Canada also commanded the Multi-National Brigade for Command South, a main military force in the region. In May 2006, the Canadian government extended Canadian military commitments to Afghanistan by two years, replacing earlier plans to withdraw soldiers in 2006.\\r\\nOn 28 February 2006, control of Regional Command South was transferred from U.S. Lieutenant General Karl Eikenberry to Canadian Brigadier-General David Fraser in a ceremony at Kandahar Airfield.\\r\\nAdditionally, Foreign Affairs Canada stated that the commitment was more than just military, employing a \\"whole of government approach\\", in which a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), utilizing personnel from the military, Foreign Affairs, the Canadian International Development Agency and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, would provide a dual role of security as well as reconstruction of the country and political structure.[12]\\r\\nOn 31 July 2006, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force assumed command of the south of the country and the Canadian Task Force was transferred from the jurisdiction of ARCHER (Operation Enduring Freedom) back to ATHENA (ISAF).\\r\\nWhen the Canadian Forces returned to Kandahar after being deployed to Kabul in 2003, the Taliban began a major offensive, and the Canadians were caught in the middle. After a spring in which a record number of attacks against Canadian soldiers had been set, which included six deaths to the CF, the Taliban in Kandahar and Helmand Provinces were massing.\\r\\nOperation Mountain Thrust was launched in the beginning of the summer in 2006. Canadians of the 1 PPCLI Battle Group were one of the leading combatants and the first fighting when the Battle of Panjwaii took place. Complex mud-walled compounds made the rural Panjwaii District take on an almost urban style of fighting in some places. Daily firefights, artillery bombardments, and allied airstrikes turned the tides of the battle in favour of the Canadians. After Operation Mountain Thrust came to an end, Taliban fighters flooded back into the Panjwaii District in numbers that had not been seen yet in a single area in the \\"post Anaconda\\" war.\\r\\nThe Canadian Forces came under NATO command at the end of July, and the 1 RCR Battle Group replaced the PPCLI. Canadians launched Operation Medusa in September in an attempt to clear the areas of Taliban fighters from Panjwaii once and for all. The fighting of Operation Medusa led the way to the second, and most fierce Battle of Panjwaii in which daily gun-battles, ambushes, and mortar and rocket attacks were targeting the Canadian troops. The Taliban had massed with an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 fighters. The Taliban were reluctant to give up the area, and after being surrounded by the Canadian Forces, they dug in and fought a more conventional style battle. After weeks of fighting, the Taliban had been cleared from the Panjwaii area and Canadian reconstruction efforts in the area began.\\r\\nOn 15 September 2006, the Canadian government committed a squadron of Leopard C2 tanks from Lord Strathcona's Horse, and an additional 200 to 500 troops to Afghanistan.[14]\\r\\nOn 1 November 2006, Dutch Major-General Ton van Loon succeeded Brigadier-General David Fraser as head of NATO Regional Command South in Afghanistan, a post which he retained for six months.[15]\\r\\nOn 15 December 2006, the Canadians launched Operation Falcon Summit into Zhari District, to the north of Panjwaii. The operation was the Canadian involvement in the NATO-led Operation Mountain Fury. During Operation Falcon Summit, the Canadians gained control of several key villages and towns that were former Taliban havens, such as Howz-E Madad. During the first week of the operation, massive Canadian artillery and tank barrages were carried out in a successful attempt to clear pockets of Taliban resistance. The operation concluded with plans to build a new road linking Panjwaii with Kandahar's Highway 1 that runs east-west through Zhari.\\r\\nIn February 2007, the 2 RCR Battle Group took over to carry on with combat operations in several districts in Kandahar Province.\\r\\nFrom 15 July 2007 to February 2008, units from CFB Valcartier near Quebec City served in Kandahar filling most positions in the Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team (OMLT) and providing the protective company for the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT). The 3rd Battalion Royal 22e Rgiment Battle Group, with supporting troops from 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group and a composite tank squadron from Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) conducted operations on the ground. This rotation reflected a change in Canadian tactics, with emphasis on systematically clearing-holding-building in the districts of Panjwaii and Zhari, while also protecting Arghandab District and the AfghanÿPakistan border in the area of Spin Boldak. The focus was on intimately working with the Afghan army, police and civil administration to hold cleared areas rather than subsequently lose them to returning Taliban, as had previously occurred throughout the South and East.\\r\\nIn February 2008, the Van Doos contingent was replaced by force centred on a PPCLI battle group. Also in February 2008, Canadian Major-General Marc Lessard took command of Regional Command South for a nine-month period.\\r\\nOn 13 March 2008, the Harper Conservative government's motion to extend the military mission past February 2009 into 2011 was approved in a parliamentary vote with the support of the Liberal opposition. The extension of almost another three years had a focus on reconstruction and training of Afghan troops, and set a firm pullout date, calling for Canadian troops to leave Afghanistan by December 2011. While the Liberals voted in favour of the Conservatives' confidence motion, the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Qubcois voted against it, having consistently rejected any extension of the military mission. NDP leader Jack Layton said \\"There are millions of Canadians who don't want this strategy to continue. The population prefers a road to peace.\\"[16]\\r\\nAs part of the new American administration's policy on Afghanistan it was announced that 17,000 new U.S. troops would be deployed to the country with a third stationed in Kandahar province.[17] On 10 August 2009, Brig-Gen. Jonathan Vance of Task Force Kandahar transferred authority of some of Kandahar Province to Col. Harry Tunnell IV, commander of the U.S. army's 5th Stryker Brigade. Canadian troops were then stationed primarily around Kandahar City and the surrounding districts.[18]\\r\\nOn 1 December 2009 U.S. president Obama announced a major troop increase that would send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.[19] The Canadian troops remained mostly active in the Panjwaii and Kandahar districts where they were located at the end of 2009.[citation needed] Canadians were also active in the Zhari and Daman districts.[20]\\r\\nIn February 2010 Canadian air forces and ground troops from 3 PPCLI took part in the highly publicized Marja offensive.[21] In late June 2010 control of the Zhari and Arghandab districts were transferred to the United States 101st Airborne Division.[22] Two weeks later Canadian Forces transferred Kandahar city to the Americans. As of this point most of Canada's forces were in the Panjwaii district as well as Dand and Daman.[23] On 27 November 2010, in the tenth and final troop rotation, the 1st Battalion of the Royal 22e Rgiment took over, marking the final rotation before Canada's withdrawal from Afghanistan.[24]\\r\\nCanada withdrew the bulk of its troops from Afghanistan in 2011, with the Infantry Battle Group withdrawn by the end of July, and all Canadian Forces personnel and equipment withdrawn from Kandahar by the end of December 2011. In September 2008, Conservative leader Stephen Harper pledged this, saying a decade at war is enough, after having extended the withdrawal deadline twice already. He acknowledged that neither the Canadian public nor the troops themselves had any appetite to stay longer in the war and said that only a small group of advisers might remain.[25][26][27][28][29]\\r\\nOn 9 December 2010, it was announced that after the end of combat operations in July 2011, Canadian Forces (approximately 950 newly posted specialized personnel) would be posted to the NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan to continue the training of the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police.[30] Canada's contribution to this mission was dubbed Operation Attention and took place mostly around Kabul with some training occurring at Mazar-i-Sharif.[31]\\r\\nBy late 2013 Canada began withdrawing its final soldiers from the training mission. In October the force was down to 650 personnel from over 800 and the withdrawal from Afghanistan was scheduled to be completed by March 2014.[31] On 12 March the government announced with little fanfare that the mission was formally completed with a flag lowering ceremony held in Kabul.[32] [33] The last 84 soldiers left Afghanistan on 15 March 2014, ending Canada's twelve-year military presence in the country.[34]\\r\\nA key element of Canadian operations in Afghanistan is the Kandahar Provincial Reconstruction Team (KPRT), one of 25 provincial reconstruction teams throughout the country. A Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) is a unit introduced by the United States government to support reconstruction efforts in unstable states, performing duties ranging from humanitarian work to the training of police and the military. Following NATO's involvement, command of some PRTs was transferred from the US to other nations under the ISAF.\\r\\nThe Kandahar PRT is composed of around 330ÿ335 personnel composed largely of Canadian Forces elements (315), but also of a few diplomats, correctional officers, development specialists, and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).[35][36][37] The Kandahar PRT also includes one U.S. State Department official, one U.S. development official, and several U.S. police mentors.[36]\\r\\nBy 2007, Canada's effort was in full effect in order to rebuild Kandahar. The KPRT task was in relation to the National Solidarity Program (NSP). The NSP was \\"designed to re-generate local village councils and their ability to work for a common purpose, something sorely lacking after 25 years of focus on basic self-preservation.\\"[38] The role of KPRT to fulfill the goals of the NSP was one that required much time and patience. As the NSP grew, \\"power shifted away from drug lords and Taliban chieftains and back to Afghans\\" through the rebuilding of community and creating trust in the \\"power of good government.\\"[38]\\r\\nCanada and its allies used several methods to develop and build the economy in Kandahar. One of its main challenges was convincing its people that their future lies in good government and much had to be done. One of the tasks at hand was the organization and professionalism that needed to be added to the Afghan police. The problem that Canadians faced is that one day they may be dealing with Afghan police who assist with tracking down the Taliban, and the next a corrupt police force taking bribes from the Taliban and drug lords. In order to correct this Canadians used the RCMP to train new police forces in war-shattered societies.[39]\\r\\nAnother crucial element toward the rebirth in Kandahar is its agriculture, and the need to show farmers how to prosper. After facing ten years of drought CIDA focused development on getting wadis, karezes, canals, and more modern pipelines into the older fields so that farmers could radically increase crop production.\\"[40] The next step was then teaching the Afghan farmers how to \\"improve crop yields\\" which they were receptive too wanting to improve their way of life. The difficulty with farmers in this region is the fact that their interests coincide with the Taliban and local drug lords. Both these groups, \\"depend on a climate of fear and dependency in the countryside to support their lifestyles and their wars.\\"[41] By 2007 the work of the PRT was gaining considerable ground. This was evident as \\"Kandaharis took on much of the rebuilding process themselves.\\" The Taliban threat was down and the UN plan for the people of Kandahar to help it its own renewal was in full effect. Despite the continued fighting and Taliban resurgence Kandahar was maintaining stability and beginning to prosper.\\r\\nThe PRT is about one-eighth the size of the overall 2,830 Canadian military forces in Afghanistan. The 2008 Manley Report recommended that the KPRT be given more funding and attention and be placed under civilian leadership instead. The KPRT was transferred to civilian command in April 2010, during the update in the US civilian surge to Kandahar, with the Representative of Canada in Kandahar Ben Rowswell as KPRT Director and former US Ambassador Bill Harris as Deputy Director. With impending Canadian draw down in 2011 and increasing number of US soldiers and civilians in Kandahar, the KPRT transitioned from Canadian to American command in late 2010, completed with the transfer of authority in early 2011 of KPRT directorship from Tim Martin to American diplomat Ben Moeling.[36]\\r\\nFollowing the recommendations of the Manley report, the Canadian government sought to highlight several so-called \\"signature\\" projects in Kandahar Province.[36] The government of Canada's communications on Afghanistan website highlights:[42]\\r\\nAs a result of these signature projects, Within five years, more than six thousand schools have been rebuilt and six of thirteen million children are now in school. Roads and bridges have been repaired, new roads have been built, and new wells have been dug. Access to health clinics is vastly better than it was five years ago and the infant mortality rate is beginning to drop. Programs in rural transportation, safe drinking water, irrigation, and schools are among the twenty thousand projects that are now underway.[43] The work of the NSP also saw tremendous progression in the Afghan government. For example, More than sixteen thousand locally elected community development councils now dot Afghanistan, and elected leaders choose projects that meet their priorities.[43]\\r\\nThe mission to Afghanistan was politically controversial with the Canadian public: On 31 August 2006, New Democrat leader Jack Layton called for the withdrawal of Canadian troops from the south of Afghanistan, to begin immediately and soon afterwards pursue peace negotiations with the Taliban insurgents. He argued that the mission lacked clear objectives and measures of success, and that the counter-insurgency operation was undermining reconstruction in Afghanistan.[52] The Liberals and the governing Conservatives were generally supportive of the mission in Afghanistan. While initially in support of the war, the Bloc Qubcois opposed any extension beyond the initial withdrawal date. Opinion amongst pundits and academics was generally divided along the ideological lines, with left-leaning media outlets and think-tanks being against the war, and right-leaning publications and institutes being supportive.\\r\\nSuccessive surveys conducted by various pollsters across the political spectrum suggest opposition to the war in the general public grew with time:\\r\\nMany Canadians were vocal in their opposition to the war, and several protests were held by many anti-war groups, most of them organized under the Canadian Peace Alliance umbrella. In Quebec, some parliamentarians refused to stand in honour of soldiers visiting the National Assembly.[60] Other Canadians were supportive of the mission, and more particularly of the troops.[61] A grassroots phenomenon known as the Highway of Heroes that started in 2006 saw hundreds of local residents gathering along bridges to salute soldiers' remains travelling between CFB Trenton and the Coroner's office in Toronto. Some Canadians also participated in Red Fridays in honour of the soldiers.\\r\\nBetween 2001 and 2014, 159 Canadian soldiers died while on mission in Afghanistan. (The 159th fatality was added in October 2015, when the Department of National Defence determined that a death that had occurred in 2005 was mission-related.) Of these, 123 were due to hostile circumstances, including 95 due to improvised explosive devices (IED) or landmines, 21 due to rocket-propelled grenade, small arms or mortar fire, 11 due to suicide bomb attacks, and one died falling from a high ground position on a cliff during a combat operation that involved firefight. An additional 22 soldiers died in accidents or other non-combat circumstances; 7 due to \\"friendly fire\\", 6 in vehicle accidents, two in an accidental helicopter crash, 2 from accidental falls, 2 from accidental gunshots, 1 suicide death and 2 unspecified non-combat-related deaths in country. Additionally, one unspecified non-combat-related death occurred at a support base in the Persian Gulf. Canada suffered the third-highest absolute number of deaths of any nation among the foreign military participants, and one of the highest casualties per capita of coalition members since the beginning of the war.[62][63] More than 2000 soldiers were injured during the war between April 2002 to December 2011. 635 soldiers were injured in action while 1412 were injured in patrol or non-combat situation.[64]\\r\\nOne senior Foreign Affairs official, Glyn Berry, and four Canadian civilians have also been killed in Afghanistan due to hostile circumstances.\\r\\nThe Canadian Forces lost over 34 vehicles and 359 were damaged during the mission in Afghanistan. The land force lost 13 LAV-III and another 159 were damaged by roadside bombs or enemy fires. At least three Leopard C2 were destroyed and 15 were damaged during the mission in Afghanistan. A dozen of unspecified trucks in various sizes and models were damaged and seven were destroyed. A number of floodlight assembly trailers and kitchen trailers were destroyed during various rocket attacks against Kandahar International Airport.[71]\\r\\nBattle honours for the Afghanistan mission were bestowed in May 2014 to units of the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force that participated. Fifteen RCN surface vessels received the theatre honour \\"Arabian Sea.\\" The \\"Afghanistan\\" theatre honour went to two units of the RCN, 65 units of the Canadian Army, 4 units of the RCAF and 1 unit of the Special Forces.[72]\\r\\nA number of deployed units were recognized with the Commander-in-Chief Unit Commendation, including the 1st Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment, 1st Battalion, PPCLI, 3rd Battalion, PPCLI, and 3rd Battalion, Royal 22e Rgiment.[73]\\r\\nThe Calgary Highlanders was awarded the Canadian Forces Unit Commendation for contributing more reserve soldiers to deployed units in Afghanistan than any other reserve unit. The unit deployed 107% of its established strength to the mission in Afghanistan, \\"significantly more than any other reserve unit.\\"[74]\\r\\nOver the first four years in Afghanistan, a number of decorations for bravery or for military merit were awarded to Canadian soldiers. Of particular note, in December 2003, four PPCLI snipers from 3 PPCLI were awarded Mentions in Dispatches by the Canadian Army and the Bronze Star by the U.S. Army for their actions in combat during Operation Anaconda, 2ÿ11 March 2002. These were Master Corporal Graham Ragsdale, Master Corporal Tim McMeekin, Corporal Dennis Eason, Corporal Rob Furlong and Master Corporal Arron Perry .[75]\\r\\nThe numbers of decorations being awarded increased when Canadian forces took over responsibility for Kandahar Province in 2006 and confronted an insurgency that was determined to regain control of the Pashtun heartland.?During the period 2006-2011, Canadian forces came under fire from enemy forces for the first time since the Korean War and, because of this, 109 Decorations for Military Valour were awarded for the first time since the new system of decorations had been established in 1993. By the end of Operation Athena in 2011, the following awards had been made for courage \\"in the presence of the enemy.\\"\\r\\nThe first awards of Decorations for Military Valour were made in 2006 to members of 1 PPCLI Battle Group.\\r\\nOn 27 October 2006, Sergeant Patrick Tower of the PPCLI became the first ever recipient of the Canadian Star of Military Valour. It came as a result of actions on 3 August 2006, where he assumed command of his platoon under fire, and escorted them to safety.[77]\\r\\nSergeant Michael Thomas Victor Denine, PPCLI, was awarded the Medal of Military Valour for his actions as part of Operation Archer. On 17 May 2006, though under intense rocket-propelled grenade, machine gun and small arms fire, Sergeant Denine exited a light armoured vehicle and manned the pintle-mounted machine gun. In spite of being completely exposed to enemy fire, Sergeant Denine laid down such a volume of suppressive fire that he forced the enemy to withdraw.[77]\\r\\nOn 24 May 2006, while under intense enemy fire, Master Corporal Collin Ryan Fitzgerald, PPCLI, entered and re-entered a burning platoon vehicle, driving it off the roadway and allowing the other vehicles trapped in the enemy's kill zone to break free, for which he was awarded the Medal of Military Valour.[77]\\r\\nOn 13 July, during Operation Archer, Private Jason Lamont, PPCLI, ran across open ground through concentrated enemy fire in order to deliver first aid to a wounded comrade, for which he was also awarded the Medal of Military Valour.[77]\\r\\nMajor William Hilton Fletcher, PPCLI, received the Star of Military Valour.[78] He was recognized for demonstrating extraordinary bravery during his service in Afghanistan from January to August 2006. He repeatedly exposed himself to intense fire while leading C Company, 1 PPCLI Battle Group, on foot, to assault heavily defended enemy positions.\\r\\nCaptain Derek Prohar, PPCLI, received the Medal of Military Valour. Assigned as liaison officer with the U.S. Special Forces in Afghanistan during the battle at Sperwan Ghar, 5ÿ12 September 2006, Captain Prohar operated as the rear machine gunner on the battalion commander's vehicle. He was wounded by an improvised explosive device during an intense enemy ambush. Despite his injuries, he continued returning fire and assisted the commander with the control of the attack, which resulted in the successful seizing of key terrain.[79]\\r\\nRoyal Air Force Flight Lieutenant Chris Hasler, a Canadian, was invested with the Distinguished Flying Cross personally by Queen Elizabeth II on 23 May 2007 for flying resupply missions under fire in Chinook helicopters in Afghanistan in 2006. He is the first Canadian to be decorated for bravery in the air since the Korean War.[80]\\r\\nAt the end of 2006, every Canadian soldier was selected by the Canadian Press as the Canadian Newsmaker of the Year due to the war in Afghanistan.[81]\\r\\nIn late December 2008, reports began to surface of possible \\"inappropriate conduct\\" in relation to the death of a \\"presumed insurgent\\".[82] The Canadian Forces National Investigation Service investigated the incident, resulting in second-degree murder charges against Captain Robert Semrau on 31 December 2008.[83] According to court documents released on 6 January 2009, Captain Semrau, who was serving with NATO's Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team supervising and mentoring Afghan soldiers in Helmand Provence, is alleged to have killed a wounded insurgent found by Afghan National Army troops after they came under a Taliban ambush on 19 October 2008. According to the \\"detention review synopsis\\" filed by Crown prosecutor Major Marylene Trudel, Afghan soldiers found a man whose wounds \\"appeared too severe for any type of treatment in situ\\" and disarmed him. The statement goes on to allege that Semrau was seen near the wounded man when two shots were heard.[84][85] The document states that \\"After evaluating all available evidence, the prosecution believes that it was Captain Semrau who fired both shots, that these shots resulted in the death of the severely wounded insurgent and that Captain Semrau had no lawful justification for shooting the severely wounded insurgent\\".[85] The prosecution also claimed that it would produce a witness who would testify that he saw Semrau shoot the wounded man. The body of the man was left behind at the scene of the ambush and was never found.[84] Major Trudel added that the charges against Captain Semrau could change and that the prosecution was \\"still a step behind that process.\\"[84]\\r\\nOn 18 September 2009, the Canadian Forces announced that Captain Semrau would be facing General Court Martial on four charges:\\r\\nCourt Proceedings began on 25 January 2010, before a Military Judge and a five-person panel.[87] On 24 March, Semrau pleaded not guilty to the four charges. On 19 July, he was found not guilty of murder, attempted murder, and negligence, but guilty of disgraceful conduct.[88][89] On 5 October 2010, he was dismissed from the military and his rank was reduced to second lieutenant, but he was not sentenced to jail.[90] Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Guy Perron, explaining his sentencing, described Captain Semrau as a courageous soldier and leader, and that he was \\"probably caught between his moral values and his duties as a soldier\\". He also said that Captain Semrau had even more responsibility towards his duties, because he was in a leadership position?: \\"How can we expect our soldiers to respect the rules of engagement if our officers don't?\\".[91]\\r\\nRobert Semrau was interviewed for CBC radio on the publication of his book, The Taliban Don't Wave.[92]\\r\\nIn 2007 allegations arose that the Canadian military was handing detainees over to the Afghan military without first making sure that they would not be abused. This evolved into a political scandal in Canada that eventually resulted in Defence Minister Gordon O'Connor being demoted.\\r\\nOn 18 November 2009, allegations regarding the treatment of Taliban prisoners captured by Canadian forces in Afghanistan resurfaced in parliamentary testimony by Richard Colvin, the second highest-ranked member of Canada's diplomatic service in Afghanistan from 2006 to 2007. Colvin testified that \\"According to our information, the likelihood is that all the Afghans we handed over were tortured. For interrogators in Kandahar, it was a standard operating procedure.\\" Colvin also testified that he had made numerous reports to both the Department of Defence and the Foreign Affairs Department about the situation, starting in 2006.[93] Defence Minister Peter MacKay responded to the allegations saying \\"I don't believe it's credible. I don't believe it's backed up by fact and what we have to deal with in a parliamentary hearing, as we do in a court of law, or another judicial or public inquiry, is evidence that can be substantiated\\".[94]\\r\\nThe estimated cost of continuing Canadian operations in Afghanistan is the subject of considerable debate. Initial government estimates for the period 2001 to 2009 were as low as CAD$9 billion according to Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay in June 2006,[95][96] but later government estimates of the incremental cost of the conflict (as distinct from the fixed cost of DND operations unrelated to Afghanistan) increased to CAD$5 billion in March 2008 due to equipment purchases.[97]\\r\\nIndependent estimates of the total cost of the conflict range as high as CAD$18.5 billion by 2011, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer.[98] The discrepancy between this and government estimates lies in the difficulty in distinguishing between routine military costs and those dedicated specifically to the Afghan conflict, as well as the inclusion of long term costs relating to injured soldiers and estimated lost productivity caused by personnel afflicted with Operational Stress Injuries, such as post-traumatic stress disorder.\\r\\nVarious new equipment was purchased by the CF for the mission to ensure safer conditions for personnel:\\r\\n[99]\\r\\nOn 25 January 2002, Canada officially re-established diplomatic relations with Afghanistan.

Earth rotates eastward, in prograde motion. As viewed from the north pole star Polaris, Earth turns counter clockwise.\\r\\nThe North Pole, also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole, is the point in the Northern Hemisphere where Earth's axis of rotation meets its surface. This point is distinct from Earth's North Magnetic Pole. The South Pole is the other point where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface, in Antarctica.\\r\\nEarth rotates once in about 24 hours with respect to the Sun, but once every 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds with respect to the stars (see below). Earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time; thus, a day was shorter in the past. This is due to the tidal effects the Moon has on Earth's rotation. Atomic clocks show that a modern day is longer by about 1.7 milliseconds than a century ago,[1] slowly increasing the rate at which UTC is adjusted by leap seconds. Analysis of historical astronomical records shows a slowing trend of 2.3 milliseconds per century since the 8th century BCE.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the ancient Greeks, several of the Pythagorean school believed in the rotation of the earth rather than the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens. Perhaps the first was Philolaus (470ÿ385 BCE), though his system was complicated, including a counter-earth rotating daily about a central fire.[3]\\r\\nA more conventional picture was that supported by Hicetas, Heraclides and Ecphantus in the fourth century BCE who assumed that the earth rotated but did not suggest that the earth revolved about the sun. In the third century BCE, Aristarchus of Samos suggested the sun's central place.\\r\\nHowever, Aristotle in the fourth century BCE criticized the ideas of Philolaus as being based on theory rather than observation. He established the idea of a sphere of fixed stars that rotated about the earth.[4] This was accepted by most of those who came after, in particular Claudius Ptolemy (2nd century CE), who thought the earth would be devastated by gales if it rotated.[5]\\r\\nIn 499 CE, the Indian astronomer Aryabhata wrote that the spherical earth rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the Earth. He provided the following analogy: \\"Just as a man in a boat going in one direction sees the stationary things on the bank as moving in the opposite direction, in the same way to a man at Lanka the fixed stars appear to be going westward.\\"[6][7]\\r\\nIn the 10th century, some Muslim astronomers accepted that the Earth rotates around its axis.[8] According to al-Biruni, Abu Sa'id al-Sijzi (d. circa 1020) invented an astrolabe called al-zraqؐ based on the idea believed by some of his contemporaries \\"that the motion we see is due to the Earth's movement and not to that of the sky.\\"[9][10] The prevalence of this view is further confirmed by a reference from the 13th century which states: \\"According to the geometers [or engineers] (muhandisؐn), the earth is in constant circular motion, and what appears to be the motion of the heavens is actually due to the motion of the earth and not the stars.\\"[9] Treatises were written to discuss its possibility, either as refutations or expressing doubts about Ptolemy's arguments against it.[11] At the Maragha and Samarkand observatories, the Earth's rotation was discussed by Tusi (b. 1201) and Qushji (b. 1403); the arguments and evidence they used resemble those used by Copernicus.[12]\\r\\nIn medieval Europe, Thomas Aquinas accepted Aristotle's view[13] and so, reluctantly, did John Buridan[14] and Nicole Oresme[15] in the fourteenth century. Not until Nicolaus Copernicus in 1543 adopted a heliocentric world system did the contemporary understanding of earth's rotation begin to be established. Copernicus pointed out that if the movement of the earth is violent, then the movement of the stars must be very much more so. He acknowledged the contribution of the Pythagoreans and pointed to examples of relative motion. For Copernicus this was the first step in establishing the simpler pattern of planets circling a central sun.[16]\\r\\nTycho Brahe, who produced accurate observations on which Kepler based his laws, used Copernicus's work as the basis of a system assuming a stationary earth. In 1600, William Gilbert strongly supported the earth's rotation in his treatise on the earth's magnetism[17] and thereby influenced many of his contemporaries.[18] Those like Gilbert who did not openly support or reject the motion of the earth about the sun are often called \\"semi-Copernicans\\".[19] A century after Copernicus, Riccioli disputed the model of a rotating earth due to the lack of then-observable eastward deflections in falling bodies;[20] such deflections would later be called the Coriolis effect. However, the contributions of Kepler, Galileo and Newton gathered support for the theory of the rotation of the Earth.\\r\\nThe earth's rotation implies that the equator bulges and the poles are flattened. In his Principia, Newton predicted this flattening would occur in the ratio of 1:230, and pointed to the 1673 pendulum measurements by Richer as corroboration of the change in gravity,[21] but initial measurements of meridian lengths by Picard and Cassini at the end of the 17th century suggested the opposite. However measurements by Maupertuis and the French Geodesic Mission in the 1730s established the flattening, thus confirming both Newton and the Copernican position.[22]\\r\\nIn the Earth's rotating frame of reference, a freely moving body follows an apparent path that deviates from the one it would follow in a fixed frame of reference. Because of the Coriolis effect, falling bodies veer slightly eastward from the vertical plumb line below their point of release, and projectiles veer right in the northern hemisphere (and left in the southern) from the direction in which they are shot. The Coriolis effect is mainly observable at a meteorological scale, where it is responsible for the differing rotation direction of cyclones in the northern and southern hemispheres.\\r\\nHooke, following a 1679 suggestion from Newton, tried unsuccessfully to verify the predicted eastward deviation of a body dropped from a height of 8.2 meters, but definitive results were only obtained later, in the late 18th and early 19th century, by Giovanni Battista Guglielmini in Bologna, Johann Friedrich Benzenberg in Hamburg and Ferdinand Reich in Freiberg, using taller towers and carefully released weights.[n 1] A ball dropped from a height of 158.5?m (520?ft) departed by 27.4?mm (1.08?in) from the vertical compared with a calculated value of 28.1?mm (1.11?in).\\r\\nThe most celebrated test of Earth's rotation is the Foucault pendulum first built by physicist Lon Foucault in 1851, which consisted of a lead-filled brass sphere suspended 67 m from the top of the Panthon in Paris. Because of the Earth's rotation under the swinging pendulum, the pendulum's plane of oscillation appears to rotate at a rate depending on latitude. At the latitude of Paris the predicted and observed shift was about 11 degrees clockwise per hour. Foucault pendulums now swing in museums around the world.\\r\\nEarth's rotation period relative to the Sun (solar noon to solar noon) is its true solar day or apparent solar day. It depends on the Earth's orbital motion and is thus affected by changes in the eccentricity and inclination of Earth's orbit. Both vary over thousands of years, so the annual variation of the true solar day also varies. Generally, it is longer than the mean solar day during two periods of the year and shorter during another two.[n 2] The true solar day tends to be longer near perihelion when the Sun apparently moves along the ecliptic through a greater angle than usual, taking about 10 seconds longer to do so. Conversely, it is about 10 seconds shorter near aphelion. It is about 20 seconds longer near a solstice when the projection of the Sun's apparent motion along the ecliptic onto the celestial equator causes the Sun to move through a greater angle than usual. Conversely, near an equinox the projection onto the equator is shorter by about 20 seconds. Currently, the perihelion and solstice effects combine to lengthen the true solar day near 22 December by 30 mean solar seconds, but the solstice effect is partially cancelled by the aphelion effect near 19 June when it is only 13 seconds longer. The effects of the equinoxes shorten it near 26 March and 16 September by 18 seconds and 21 seconds, respectively.[24][25][26]\\r\\nThe average of the true solar day during the course of an entire year is the mean solar day, which contains 86,400 mean solar seconds. Currently, each of these seconds is slightly longer than an SI second because Earth's mean solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal friction. The average length of the mean solar day since the introduction of the leap second in 1972 has been about 0 to 2 ms longer than 86,400 SI seconds.[27][28][29] Random fluctuations due to core-mantle coupling have an amplitude of about 5 ms.[30][31] The mean solar second between 1750 and 1892 was chosen in 1895 by Simon Newcomb as the independent unit of time in his Tables of the Sun. These tables were used to calculate the world's ephemerides between 1900 and 1983, so this second became known as the ephemeris second. In 1967 the SI second was made equal to the ephemeris second.[32]\\r\\nThe apparent solar time is a measure of the Earth's rotation and the difference between it and the mean solar time is known as the equation of time.\\r\\nEarth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is 86,164.098 903 691 seconds of mean solar time (UT1) (23h 56m 4.098 903 691s, 0.997 269 663 237 16 mean solar days).[33][n 3] Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean vernal equinox, named sidereal day, is 86,164.090 530 832 88 seconds of mean solar time (UT1) (23h 56m 4.090 530 832 88s, 0.997 269 566 329 08 mean solar days).[33] Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms.[35]\\r\\nBoth the stellar day and the sidereal day are shorter than the mean solar day by about 3 minutes 56 seconds. The mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods 1623ÿ2005[36] and 1962ÿ2005.[37]\\r\\nRecently (1999ÿ2010) the average annual length of the mean solar day in excess of 86,400 SI seconds has varied between 0.25 ms and 1 ms, which must be added to both the stellar and sidereal days given in mean solar time above to obtain their lengths in SI seconds (see Fluctuations in the length of day).\\r\\nThe angular speed of Earth's rotation in inertial space is (7.2921150 I 0.0000001) G10?5 radians per SI second (mean solar second).[33] Multiplying by (180/ radians)G(86,400 seconds/mean solar day) yields 360.9856/mean solar day, indicating that Earth rotates more than 360 relative to the fixed stars in one solar day. Earth's movement along its nearly circular orbit while it is rotating once around its axis requires that Earth rotate slightly more than once relative to the fixed stars before the mean Sun can pass overhead again, even though it rotates only once (360) relative to the mean Sun.[n 4] Multiplying the value in rad/s by Earth's equatorial radius of 6,378,137 m (WGS84 ellipsoid) (factors of 2 radians needed by both cancel) yields an equatorial speed of 465.1?m/s (1,526?ft/s), or 1,674.4?km/h (1,040.4?mph).[38] Some sources state that Earth's equatorial speed is slightly less, or 1,669.8 km/h.[39] This is obtained by dividing Earth's equatorial circumference by 24 hours. However, the use of only one circumference unwittingly implies only one rotation in inertial space, so the corresponding time unit must be a sidereal hour. This is confirmed by multiplying by the number of sidereal days in one mean solar day, 1.002 737 909 350 795,[33] which yields the equatorial speed in mean solar hours given above of 1,674.4 km/h.\\r\\nThe tangential speed of Earth's rotation at a point on Earth can be approximated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude.[40] For example, the Kennedy Space Center is located at latitude 28.59 N, which yields a speed of: cos 28.59 G 1,674.4?km/h (1,040.4?mph; 465.1?m/s) = 1,470.23?km/h (913.56?mph; 408.40?m/s)\\r\\nThe Earth's rotation axis moves with respect to the fixed stars (inertial space); the components of this motion are precession and nutation. It also moves with respect to the Earth's crust; this is called polar motion.\\r\\nPrecession is a rotation of the Earth's rotation axis, caused primarily by external torques from the gravity of the Sun, Moon and other bodies. The polar motion is primarily due to free core nutation and the Chandler wobble.\\r\\nOver millions of years, the Earth's rotation slowed significantly by tidal acceleration through gravitational interactions with the Moon. In this process, angular momentum is slowly transferred to the Moon at a rate proportional to \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle r^{-6}}\\r\\n\\r\\n, where \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle r}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the orbital radius of the Moon. This process gradually increased the length of day to its current value and resulted in the Moon being tidally locked with the Earth.\\r\\nThis gradual rotational deceleration is empirically documented with estimates of day lengths obtained from observations of tidal rhythmites and stromatolites; a compilation of these measurements[41] found the length of day to increase steadily from about 21 hours at 600Myr ago[42] to the current 24 hour value. By counting the microscopic lamina that form at higher tides, tidal frequencies (and thus day lengths) can be estimated, much like counting tree rings, though these estimates can be increasingly unreliable at older ages.[43]\\r\\nThe current rate of tidal deceleration is anomalously high, implying the Earth's rotational velocity must have decreased more slowly in the past. Empirical data[41] tentatively shows a sharp increase in rotational deceleration about 600Myr ago. Some models suggest that the Earth maintained a constant day length of 21 hours throughout much of the Precambrian.[42] This day length corresponds to the semidiurnal resonant period of the thermally-driven atmospheric tide; at this day length, the decelerative lunar torque could have been canceled by an accelerative torque from the atmospheric tide, resulting in no net torque and a constant rotational period. This stabilizing effect could have been broken by a sudden change in global temperature. Recent computational simulations support this hypothesis and suggest the Marinoan or Sturtian glaciations broke this stable configuration about 600Myr ago, citing the resemblance of simulated results and existing paleorotational data.[44]\\r\\nAdditionally, some large-scale events, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, have caused the length of a day to shorten by 3 microseconds by affecting the Earth's moment of inertia.[45] Post-glacial rebound, ongoing since the last Ice age, is also changing the distribution of the Earth's mass thus affecting the moment of inertia of the Earth and, by the conservation of angular momentum, the Earth's rotation period.[46]\\r\\nThe primary monitoring of the Earth's rotation is performed with very-long-baseline interferometry coordinated with the Global Positioning System, satellite laser ranging, and other satellite techniques. This provides an absolute reference for the determination of universal time, precession, and nutation.[47]\\r\\nThere are recorded observations of solar and lunar eclipses by Babylonian and Chinese astronomers beginning in the 8th century BCE, as well as from the medieval Islamic world and elsewhere. These observations can be used to determine changes in the Earth's rotation over the last 27 centuries, since the length of the day is a critical parameter in the calculation of the place and time of eclipses. A change in day length of milliseconds per century shows up as a change of hours and thousands of kilometers in eclipse observations. The ancient data is consistent with a shorter day, meaning the Earth was turning faster throughout the past.[48][49]\\r\\nThe Earth's original rotation was a vestige of the original angular momentum of the cloud of dust, rocks, and gas that coalesced to form the Solar System. This primordial cloud was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the Big Bang, as well as heavier elements ejected by supernovas. As this interstellar dust is heterogeneous, any asymmetry during gravitational accretion resulted in the angular momentum of the eventual planet.[50]\\r\\nHowever, if the giant-impact hypothesis for the origin of the Moon is correct, this primordial rotation rate would have been reset by the Theia impact 4.5 billion years ago. Regardless of the speed and tilt of the Earth's rotation before the impact, it would have experienced a day some five hours long after the impact.[51] Tidal effects would then have slowed this rate to its modern value.","input":"How long is earth's rotation on its axis?"},{"output":"30 years","context":"The National Football League has enjoyed success in selling out many of their venues from season ticket sales alone. Out of 32 teams in the league, 24 claim to have waiting lists from under 1,000 people to over 150,000. For some fans, this means a wait not just of years, but decades. This is due mostly to the NFL's short window of play; there are only eight regular-season home games, forcing the most devoted fans into a desperate and sometimes costly search for a limited number of events.[1]\\r\\nFrom 1973 to 2014, the waiting lists also had the by-product of preventing any home games of certain teams from being blacked out on local television. Under the league's blackout policy, home games were required to be sold out within 72 hours of kickoff before a telecast was allowed, and the longest waiting lists have ensured every home game of the applicable teams being locally televised. Prior to 1973, home games could not be locally televised even if they were sold out. Four teams have had the benefit of not seeing any blackouts at all since 1972 (excluding playoff games, which are not covered under season ticket purchases). This restriction was lifted by the FCC in October 2014, and the league followed suit by suspending its blackout policy for 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA personal seat license (PSL) is a license which grants the holder the right to buy season tickets for a particular team. PSLs were first used in the NFL by the expansion Carolina Panthers in 1993 to help finance their new stadium. Since that time, several teams have used the mechanism to finance new stadium projects including the Chicago Bears remodel of Soldier Field and more recently the Dallas Cowboys. The New York Jets and the New York Giants used PSL programs to finance the construction of the New Meadowlands Stadium, now MetLife Stadium.[2]\\r\\nIn 2003, the New York Jets changed their waiting list policy to require a $50 annual maintenance fee to remain on the waiting list. However, due to the long list of names and high renewal rates among existing ticket holders, there was uncertainty about the fees a person may possibly have to pay if they remained on the list for many years. After attention from the media and the New York Attorney General's Office, the Jets agreed to cap the maintenance fees at $500, allow the transfer of the waiting list position if the person moved out of state and provide at least 80% of non-renewed season tickets to waiting list members. In 2008, the Jets sent notices to those on the waiting list that the $50 annual maintenance fee would be waived and any money already accrued would be either refunded or credited toward the purchase of Jets merchandise.\\r\\nIn 2004, the New England Patriots, who have a substantial season ticket waiting list, received media attention for not allowing the son of a deceased season ticket holder to retain his father's season tickets. The following year, the New England Patriots introduced the \\"Pass It On\\" transfer program, which allows season ticket holders to transfer season tickets to immediate family members for $2,000 to $5,000 per ticket, depending on the location of the seat.[3]\\r\\nThe NFL requires that season ticket purchasers not only purchase the regular season games, but also typically two preseason games whether they want the exhibition games or not. The legality of requiring the purchase of the preseason games has been challenged all the way to the Supreme Court but it has not resulted in a change of policy for the NFL.[4]\\r\\nThe Green Bay Packers have the longest waiting list, with more than 100,000 names. The team's website says the wait is 30 years.[5] It is a common custom in Green Bay and other Wisconsin cities to put a baby's name on the list as soon as the birth certificate is obtained.[6][7][8] Transfer of standing to surviving relatives is permitted by the Packers.[5]\\r\\nThe Washington Redskins were reported to have the longest waiting list, with more than 150,000 names. However, recent investigations question whether a waiting list exists at all,[9] which would seem to be contradicted by the fact that FedExField demolished 10,000 seats heading into the 2011 season, and has since removed many upper deck sections. The New York Giants, New York Jets, Philadelphia Eagles, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Denver Broncos historically have also maintained long waiting lists for season tickets.[1]\\r\\n13 https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/01/AR2009090103984_pf.html www.packers.com","input":"How long is the waiting list for packers season tickets?"},{"output":"February 1, 2003","context":"On February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated upon reentering Earth's atmosphere, killing all seven crew members.\\r\\nThe disaster was the second fatal accident in the Space Shuttle program after Space Shuttle Challenger, which broke apart and killed the seven-member crew 73 seconds after liftoff in 1986.\\r\\nDuring the launch of STS-107, Columbia's 28th mission, a piece of foam insulation broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the left wing of the orbiter.

Planned to begin on January 11, 2001, the mission was delayed 18?times[5] and eventually launched on January 16, 2003, following STS-113. (The Columbia Accident Investigation Board determined that this delay had nothing to do with the catastrophic failure.)[5]\\r\\nAbout 82?seconds after launch from Kennedy Space Center's LC-39-A, a suitcase-sized piece of foam broke off from the External Tank (ET), striking Columbia's left wing reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) panels. As demonstrated by ground experiments conducted by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, this likely created a 6-to-10-inch (15 to 25?cm) diameter hole, allowing hot gases to enter the wing when Columbia later re-entered the atmosphere. At the time of the foam strike, the orbiter was at an altitude of about 66,000 feet (20?km; 12.5?mi), traveling at Mach?2.46 (1,626 miles per hour or 727 meters per second).\\r\\nThe Left Bipod Foam Ramp is an approximately three-foot (one-meter) long aerodynamic component made entirely of foam. The foam, not normally considered to be a structural material, is required to bear some aerodynamic loads. Because of these special requirements, the casting-in-place and curing of the ramps may be performed only by a senior technician.[6] The bipod ramp (having left and right sides) was originally designed to reduce aerodynamic stresses around the bipod attachment points at the external tank, but it was proven unnecessary in the wake of the accident and was removed from the external tank design for tanks flown after STS-107 (another foam ramp along the liquid oxygen line was also later removed from the tank design to eliminate it as a foam debris source, after analysis and tests proved this change safe).\\r\\nBipod Ramp insulation had been observed falling off, in whole or in part, on four previous flights: STS-7 (1983), STS-32 (1990), STS-50 (1992) and most recently STS-112 (just two launches before STS-107). All affected shuttle missions completed successfully. NASA management came to refer to this phenomenon as \\"foam shedding\\". As with the O-ring erosion problems that ultimately doomed the Space Shuttle Challenger, NASA management became accustomed to these phenomena when no serious consequences resulted from these earlier episodes. This phenomenon was termed \\"normalization of deviance\\" by sociologist Diane Vaughan in her book on the Challenger launch decision process.[7]\\r\\nAs it happened, STS-112 had been the first flight with the \\"ET Cam\\", a video feed mounted on the ET for the purpose of giving greater insight to the foam shedding problem. During that launch a chunk of foam broke away from the ET bipod ramp and hit the SRB-ET Attach Ring near the bottom of the left solid rocket booster (SRB) causing a dent four inches wide and three inches deep in it.[8] After STS-112, NASA leaders analyzed the situation and decided to press ahead under the justification that \\"[t]he ET is safe to fly with no new concerns (and no added risk)\\" of further foam strikes.[9]\\r\\nVideo taken during lift-off of STS-107 was routinely reviewed two hours later and revealed nothing unusual. The following day, higher-resolution film that had been processed overnight revealed the foam debris striking the left wing, potentially damaging the thermal protection on the Space Shuttle.[10] At the time, the exact location where the foam struck the wing could not be determined due to the low resolution of the tracking camera footage.\\r\\nMeanwhile, NASA's judgment about the risks was revisited. Linda Ham, chair of the Mission Management Team (MMT), said, \\"Rationale was lousy then and still is.\\" Ham and Shuttle Program Manager Ron Dittemore had both been present at the October 31, 2002, meeting where the decision to continue with launches was made.[11]\\r\\nPost-disaster analysis revealed that two previous shuttle launches (STS-52 and -62) also had bipod ramp foam loss that went undetected. In addition, Protuberance Air Load (PAL) ramp foam had also shed pieces, and there were also spot losses from large-area foams.\\r\\nIn a risk-management scenario similar to the Challenger disaster, NASA management failed to recognize the relevance of engineering concerns for safety and suggestions for imaging to inspect possible damage, and failed to respond to engineers' requests about the status of astronaut inspection of the left wing. Engineers made three separate requests for Department of Defense (DOD) imaging of the shuttle in orbit to more precisely determine damage. While the images were not guaranteed to show the damage, the capability existed for imaging of sufficient resolution to provide meaningful examination. NASA management did not honor the requests and in some cases intervened to stop the DOD from assisting.[12] The CAIB recommended subsequent shuttle flights be imaged while in orbit using ground-based or space-based DOD assets.[13] Details of the DOD's unfulfilled participation with Columbia remain secret; retired NASA official Wayne Hale stated in 2012 that \\"activity regarding other national assets and agencies remains classified and I cannot comment on that aspect of the Columbia tragedy\\".[14]\\r\\nThroughout the risk assessment process, senior NASA managers were influenced by their belief that nothing could be done even if damage were detected. This affected their stance on investigation urgency, thoroughness and possible contingency actions. They decided to conduct a parametric \\"what-if\\" scenario study more suited to determine risk probabilities of future events, instead of inspecting and assessing the actual damage. The investigation report in particular singled out NASA manager Linda Ham for exhibiting this attitude.[15] In 2013, Hale recalled that Director of Mission Operations Jon C. Harpold told him before Columbia's destruction:\\r\\nYou know, there is nothing we can do about damage to the TPS [Thermal Protection System]. If it has been damaged it's probably better not to know. I think the crew would rather not know. Don't you think it would be better for them to have a happy successful flight and die unexpectedly during entry than to stay on orbit, knowing that there was nothing to be done, until the air ran out?[16]\\r\\nMuch of the risk assessment hinged on damage predictions to the thermal protection system. These fall into two categories: damage to the silica tile on the wing lower surface, and damage to the reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) leading-edge panels. The TPS includes a third category of components, thermal insulating blankets, but damage predictions are not typically performed on them. Damage assessments on the thermal blankets can be performed after an anomaly has been observed, and this has been done at least once after the return to flight following Columbia's loss.\\r\\nBefore the flight NASA believed that the RCC was very durable. Charles F. Bolden, who worked on tile-damage scenarios and repair methods early in his astronaut career, said in 2004 that:[17]\\r\\nnever did we talk about [the RCC] because we all thought that it was impenetrable ... I spent fourteen years in the space program flying, thinking that I had this huge mass that was about five or six inches thick on the leading edge of the wing. And, to find after Columbia that it was fractions of an inch thick, and that it wasn't as strong as the Fiberglass on your Corvette, that was an eye-opener, and I think for all of us ... the best minds that I know of, in and outside of NASA, never envisioned that as a failure mode.\\r\\nDamage-prediction software was used to evaluate possible tile and RCC damage. The tool for predicting tile damage was known as \\"Crater\\", described by several NASA representatives in press briefings as not actually a software program but rather a statistical spreadsheet of observed past flight events and effects. The \\"Crater\\" tool predicted severe penetration of multiple tiles by the impact if it struck the TPS tile area, but NASA engineers downplayed this. It had been shown that the model overstated damage from small projectiles, and engineers believed that the model would also overstate damage from larger Spray-On Foam Insulation (SOFI) impacts. The program used to predict RCC damage was based on small ice impacts the size of cigarette butts, not larger SOFI impacts, as the ice impacts were the only recognized threats to RCC panels up to that point. Under one of 15 predicted SOFI impact paths, the software predicted an ice impact would completely penetrate the RCC panel. Engineers downplayed this, too, believing that impacts of the less dense SOFI material would result in less damage than ice impacts. In an e-mail exchange, NASA managers questioned whether the density of the SOFI could be used as justification for reducing predicted damage. Despite engineering concerns about the energy imparted by the SOFI material, NASA managers ultimately accepted the rationale to reduce predicted damage of the RCC panels from possible complete penetration to slight damage to the panel's thin coating.[18]\\r\\nUltimately the NASA Mission Management Team felt there was insufficient evidence to indicate that the strike was an unsafe situation, so they declared the debris strike a \\"turnaround\\" issue (not of highest importance) and denied the requests for the Department of Defense images.\\r\\nOn January 23, flight director Steve Stich sent an e-mail to Columbia, informing commander Husband and pilot McCool of the foam strike while unequivocally dismissing any concerns about entry safety.[19][20]\\r\\nDuring ascent at approximately 80 seconds, photo analysis shows that some debris from the area of the -Y ET Bipod Attach Point came loose and subsequently impacted the orbiter left wing, in the area of transition from Chine to Main Wing, creating a shower of smaller particles. The impact appears to be totally on the lower surface and no particles are seen to traverse over the upper surface of the wing. Experts have reviewed the high speed photography and there is no concern for RCC or tile damage. We have seen this same phenomenon on several other flights and there is absolutely no concern for entry.[21]\\r\\nEdward Tufte, an expert in information design and presentation,[22] remarked on poor modes of communication during the assessment made on the ground, before Columbia's reentry. NASA and Boeing favored Microsoft PowerPoint for conveying information. PowerPoint uses multi-level bullet points and orients towards single-page-of-information groupings. This is not ideal for complex scientific and engineering reports, and may have caused recipients to draw incorrect conclusions. In particular, the slide format may have emphasized optimistic options and glossed over the more accurate pessimistic viewpoints.[23]\\r\\nColumbia was scheduled to land at 9:16?a.m. EST.\\r\\nIn 2008, NASA released a detailed report on survivability aspects of the Columbia reentry. The crew would have had less than a minute between the beginning of orbiter disintegration and depressurization. The structural failure of the left wing set off alarms in the cabin, although they had no way of knowing that the wing had broken apart as the rear of the orbiter could not be seen from the cabin. All evidence indicated that the crew frantically tried to regain control of Columbia as it began to spin out of control, but the loss of the left wing caused the orbiter to yaw to the right, exposing its underside to extreme aerodynamic forces and causing total structural disintegration. The crew cabin separated from the rest of the orbiter and rapidly depressurized, which would have killed or incapacitated the astronauts within seconds. Afterwards, the cabin spun around at high RPM, which caused the seat restraints on their upper bodies to fail. They were thus whipped around violently and pummeled by flying and falling objects from the disintegrating cabin, along with their heads and necks being slammed against the helmets, which were not designed to provide any head protection. Even if the cabin had remained structurally intact and reached a lower altitude where air could refill it, the high altitude depressurization would have been fatal to the astronauts unless they received medical attention within 5 minutes, approximately the amount of time it would take between cerebral hypoxia and brain death.\\r\\nAfter cabin disintegration, the astronauts' bodies were released into the upper atmosphere and battered by extreme aerodynamic forces (close to 14,000 MPH) and temperatures. The remains of the crew then fell some 200,000 feet to earth, where they were also subjected to burning from aerodynamic heating. The official NASA report omitted some of the more graphic details on the recovery of the remains, however witnesses reported various gruesome finds such as a human heart and parts of femur bones.[27]\\r\\nAll evidence indicated that crew error was in no way responsible for the disintegration of the orbiter, and they had acted correctly and according to procedure at the first indication of trouble. Although some of the crew were not wearing gloves or helmets during reentry and some were not properly restrained in their seats, doing these things would have added nothing to their survival chances other than perhaps keeping them alive and conscious another 30 or so seconds.[28]\\r\\nAt 14:04 EST (19:04 UTC), President George W. Bush said, \\"This day has brought terrible news and great sadness to our country?... The Columbia is lost; there are no survivors\\". Despite the disaster, Bush said, \\"The cause in which they died will continue....Our journey into space will go on\\".[29] Bush later declared East Texas a federal disaster area, allowing federal agencies to help with the recovery effort.[30]\\r\\nMore than 2,000 debris fields were found in sparsely populated areas from Nacogdoches in East Texas, where a large amount of debris fell, to western Louisiana and the southwestern counties of Arkansas. A large amount of debris was recovered between Tyler, Texas and Palestine, Texas. One debris field has been mapped along a path stretching from south of Fort Worth to Hemphill, Texas, as well as into parts of Louisiana.[31] Various notable places that had debris included Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches and several casinos in Shreveport, Louisiana.[31] Along with pieces of the shuttle and bits of equipment, searchers also found human body parts, including arms, feet, a torso, and a heart.[32]\\r\\nIn the months after the disaster, the largest-ever organized ground search took place.[33] Thousands of volunteers descended upon Texas to participate in the effort to gather the Shuttles remains. According to Mike Ciannilli, Project Manager of the Columbia Research and Preservation Office, \\"[these people] put their life on hold to help out the nations space program, showing what space means to people.[34] NASA issued warnings to the public that any debris could contain hazardous chemicals, that it should be left untouched, its location reported to local emergency services or government authorities, and that anyone in unauthorized possession of debris would be prosecuted. Because of the widespread area, volunteer amateur radio operators accompanied the search teams to provide communications support.[35]\\r\\nA group of small (1?mm) adult Caenorhabditis elegans worms, living in petri dishes enclosed in aluminum canisters, survived reentry and impact with the ground and were recovered weeks after the disaster.[36][37] The culture was found to be alive on April 28, 2003.[38] The worms were part of a biological research in canisters experiment designed to study the effect of weightlessness on physiology; the experiment was conducted by Cassie Conley, NASA's planetary protection officer.\\r\\nDebris Search Pilot Jules F. Mier Jr. and Debris Search Aviation Specialist Charles Krenek died in a helicopter crash that injured three others during the search.[39]\\r\\nSome Texas residents recovered some of the debris, ignoring the warnings, and attempted to sell it on the online auction site eBay, starting at $10,000. The auction was quickly removed, but prices for Columbia merchandise such as programs, photographs and patches, went up dramatically following the disaster, creating a surge of Columbia-related listings.[40] A three-day amnesty offered for \\"looted\\" shuttle debris brought in hundreds of illegally recovered pieces.[41] About 40,000 recovered pieces of debris have never been identified. The largest pieces recovered include the front landing gear,[42] and a window frame.[43]\\r\\nOn May 9, 2008, it was reported that data from a disk drive on board Columbia had survived the shuttle accident, and while part of the 340?MB drive was damaged, 99% of the data was recovered.[44] The drive was used to store data from an experiment on the properties of shear thinning.[45]\\r\\nOn July 29, 2011, Nacogdoches authorities told NASA that a 4-foot (1.2?m) diameter piece of debris had been found in a lake. NASA identified the piece as a power reactant storage and distribution (PRSD).[46][not in citation given]\\r\\nAll recovered non-human Columbia debris is stored in unused office space at the Vehicle Assembly Building, except for parts of the crew compartment, which are kept separate.[47]\\r\\nAmong the recovered items was a videotape recording made by the astronauts during the start of re-entry. The 13-minute recording shows the flight crew astronauts conducting routine re-entry procedures and joking with each other. None gives any indication of a problem. In the video, the flight-deck crew puts on their gloves and passes the video camera around to record plasma and flames visible outside the windows of the orbiter (a normal occurrence). The recording, which on normal flights would have continued through landing, ends about four minutes before the shuttle began to disintegrate and 11 minutes before Mission Control lost the signal from the orbiter.[48]\\r\\nNASA Space Shuttle Program Manager Ron Dittemore reported that \\"The first indication was loss of temperature sensors and hydraulic systems on the left wing. They were followed seconds and minutes later by several other problems, including loss of tire pressure indications on the left main gear and then indications of excessive structural heating\\".[49] Analysis of 31 seconds of telemetry data which had initially been filtered out because of data corruption within it showed the shuttle fighting to maintain its orientation, eventually using maximum thrust from its Reaction Control System jets.\\r\\nThe investigation focused on the foam strike from the very beginning. Incidents of debris strikes from ice and foam causing damage during take-off were already well known, and had damaged orbiters, most noticeably during STS-45, STS-27, and STS-87.[50] After the loss of Columbia, NASA concluded that mistakes during installation were the likely cause of foam loss, and retrained employees at Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana to apply foam without defects.[14] Tile damage had also been traced to ablating insulating material from the cryogenic fuel tank in the past. The composition of the foam insulation had been changed in 1997 to exclude the use of freon, a chemical that is suspected to cause ozone depletion; while NASA was exempted from legislation phasing out CFCs, the agency chose to change the foam nonetheless. STS-107 used an older \\"lightweight tank\\" (a design that was succeeded by the \\"superlightweight tank\\", both being upgrades from the original space shuttle external tank) where the foam was sprayed on to the larger cylindrical surfaces using the newer freon-free foam. However, the bipod ramps were manufactured from BX-250 foam which was excluded from the EPA regulations and did use the original freon formula. The composition change did not contribute to the accident.[51] In any case, the original formulation had shown frequent foam losses, as discussed earlier in this article.\\r\\nFollowing protocols established after the loss of Challenger, an independent investigating board was created immediately after the accident. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board, or CAIB, was chaired by retired US Navy Admiral Harold W. Gehman, Jr.,[52] and consisted of expert military and civilian analysts who investigated the accident in detail.\\r\\nColumbia's flight data recorder was found near Hemphill, Texas, on March 19, 2003.[53] Unlike commercial jet aircraft, the space shuttles did not have flight data recorders intended for after-crash analysis. Instead, the vehicle data were transmitted in real time to the ground via telemetry. Since Columbia was the first shuttle, it had a special flight data OEX (Orbiter EXperiments) recorder, designed to help engineers better understand vehicle performance during the first test flights. After the initial Shuttle test-flights were completed, the recorder was never removed from Columbia, and it was still functioning on the crashed flight. It recorded many hundreds of parameters, and contained very extensive logs of structural and other data, which allowed the CAIB to reconstruct many of the events during the process leading to breakup.[54] Investigators could often use the loss of signals from sensors on the wing to track how the damage progressed.[55] This was correlated with forensic debris analysis conducted at Lehigh University and other tests to obtain a final conclusion about the probable course of events.[56]\\r\\nBeginning on May 30, 2003, foam impact tests were performed by Southwest Research Institute. They used a compressed air gun to fire a foam block of similar size and mass to that which struck Columbia, at the same estimated speed. To represent the leading edge of Columbia's left wing, RCC panels from NASA stock, along with the actual leading-edge panels from Enterprise, which were fiberglass, were mounted to a simulating structural metal frame. At the beginning of testing, the likely impact site was estimated to be between RCC panel 6 and 9, inclusive. Over many days, dozens of the foam blocks were shot at the wing leading edge model at various angles. These produced only cracks or surface damage to the RCC panels.\\r\\nDuring June, further analysis of information from Columbia's flight data recorder narrowed the probable impact site to one single panel: RCC wing panel 8. On July 7, in a final round of testing, a block fired at the side of an RCC panel 8 created a hole 16 by 16.7 inches (41 by 42?cm) in that protective RCC panel.[57] The tests demonstrated that a foam impact of the type Columbia sustained could seriously breach the thermal protection system on the wing leading edge.[58]\\r\\nOn August 26, 2003, the CAIB issued its report on the accident. The report confirmed the immediate cause of the accident was a breach in the leading edge of the left wing, caused by insulating foam shed during launch. The report also delved deeply into the underlying organizational and cultural issues that led to the accident. The report was highly critical of NASA's decision-making and risk-assessment processes. It concluded the organizational structure and processes were sufficiently flawed and that a compromise of safety was expected no matter who was in the key decision-making positions. An example was the position of Shuttle Program Manager, where one individual was responsible for achieving safe, timely launches and acceptable costs, which are often conflicting goals. The CAIB report found that NASA had accepted deviations from design criteria as normal when they happened on several flights and did not lead to mission-compromising consequences. One of those was the conflict between a design specification stating that the thermal protection system was not designed to withstand significant impacts and the common occurrence of impact damage to it during flight. The board made recommendations for significant changes in processes and organizational culture.\\r\\nOn December 30, 2008, NASA released a further report, entitled Columbia Crew Survival Investigation Report, produced by a second commission, the Spacecraft Crew Survival Integrated Investigation Team (SCSIIT). NASA had commissioned this group, \\"to perform a comprehensive analysis of the accident, focusing on factors and events affecting crew survival, and to develop recommendations for improving crew survival for all future human space flight vehicles.\\"[59] The report concluded that: \\"The Columbia depressurization event occurred so rapidly that the crew members were incapacitated within seconds, before they could configure the suit for full protection from loss of cabin pressure. Although circulatory systems functioned for a brief time, the effects of the depressurization were severe enough that the crew could not have regained consciousness. This event was lethal to the crew.\\"\\r\\nThe report also concluded:\\r\\nThe key recommendations of the report included that future spacecraft crew survival systems should not rely on manual activation to protect the crew.[60]\\r\\nOne question of special importance was whether NASA could have saved the astronauts had they known of the danger.[61] This would have to involve either rescue or repair ÿ docking at the International Space Station for use as a haven while awaiting rescue (or to use the Soyuz to systematically ferry the crew to safety) would have been impossible due to the different orbital inclination of the vehicles.\\r\\nThe CAIB determined that a rescue mission, though risky, might have been possible provided NASA management had taken action soon enough.[62][63] Normally, a rescue mission is not possible, due to the time required to prepare a shuttle for launch, and the limited consumables (power, water, air) of an orbiting shuttle. However, Atlantis was well along in processing for a planned March 1 launch on STS-114, and Columbia carried an unusually large quantity of consumables due to an Extended Duration Orbiter package. The CAIB determined that this would have allowed Columbia to stay in orbit until flight day 30 (February 15). NASA investigators determined that Atlantis processing could have been expedited with no skipped safety checks for a February 10 launch. Hence, if nothing went wrong, there was a five-day overlap for a possible rescue. As mission control could deorbit an empty shuttle, but could not control the orbiter's reentry and landing, it would likely have sent Columbia into the Pacific Ocean;[63] NASA later developed the Remote Control Orbiter system to permit mission control to land a shuttle.\\r\\nNASA investigators determined that on-orbit repair by the shuttle astronauts was possible but overall considered \\"high risk\\", primarily due to the uncertain resiliency of the repair using available materials and the anticipated high risk of doing additional damage to the Orbiter.[62][63] Columbia did not carry the Canadarm, or Remote Manipulator System, which would normally be used for camera inspection or transporting a spacewalking astronaut to the wing. Therefore, an unusual emergency extra-vehicular activity (EVA) would have been required. While there was no astronaut EVA training for maneuvering to the wing, astronauts are always prepared for a similarly difficult emergency EVA to close the external tank umbilical doors located on the orbiter underside, which is necessary for reentry. Similar methods could have reached the shuttle left wing for inspection or repair.[63]\\r\\nFor the repair, the CAIB determined that the astronauts would have to use tools and small pieces of titanium, or other metal, scavenged from the crew cabin. These metals would help protect the wing structure and would be held in place during re-entry by a water-filled bag that had turned into ice in the cold of space. The ice and metal would help restore wing leading edge geometry, preventing a turbulent airflow over the wing and therefore keeping heating and burn-through levels low enough for the crew to survive re-entry and bail out before landing. The CAIB could not determine whether a patched-up left wing would have survived even a modified re-entry, and concluded that the rescue option would have had a considerably higher chance of bringing Columbia's crew back alive.[62][63]\\r\\nOn February 4, 2003, President George W. Bush and his wife Laura led a memorial service for the astronauts' families at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. Two days later, Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne led a similar service at Washington National Cathedral. Patti LaBelle sang \\"Way Up There\\" as part of the service.[64]\\r\\nOn February 2, 2003, and throughout March, April, and May 2003, large memorial Catholic Brazilian masses and Roman Catholic memorial concerts were held in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and other cities in Brazil where Brazilian Catholic priest Marcelo Rossi and his concert partner Belo sang a Christian hymn \\"Noites Traicoeiras\\" (Treacherous Nights) as tribute to the seven Columbia astronauts, as well as the other seven crew members who lost their lives in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986. The concerts were televised to millions throughout Brazil and the world.\\r\\nOn March 26, the United States House of Representatives' Science Committee approved funds for the construction of a memorial at Arlington National Cemetery for the STS-107 crew. A similar memorial was built at the cemetery for the last crew of Challenger. On October 28, 2003, the names of the astronauts were added to the Space Mirror Memorial at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.\\r\\nOn April 1, 2003, the Opening Day of baseball season, the Houston Astros (named in honor of the U.S. space program) honored the Columbia crew by having seven simultaneous first pitches thrown by family and friends of the crew. For the National Anthem, 107 NASA personnel, including flight controllers and others involved in Columbia's final mission, carried a U.S. flag onto the field. In addition, the Astros wore the mission patch on their sleeves and replaced all dugout advertising with the mission patch logo for the entire season.[65]\\r\\nOn February 1, 2004, the first anniversary of the Columbia disaster, Super Bowl XXXVIII held in Houston's Reliant Stadium began with a pregame tribute to the crew of the Columbia by singer Josh Groban performing \\"You Raise Me Up\\", with the crew of STS-114, the first post-Columbia Space Shuttle mission, in attendance.[66][67]\\r\\nIn 2004, Bush conferred posthumous Congressional Space Medals of Honor to all 14 crew members lost in the Challenger and Columbia accidents.[68]\\r\\nNASA named several places in honor of Columbia and the crew. Seven asteroids discovered in July 2001 at the Mount Palomar observatory were officially given the names of the seven astronauts: 51823 Rickhusband, 51824 Mikeanderson, 51825 Davidbrown, 51826 Kalpanachawla, 51827 Laurelclark, 51828 Ilanramon, 51829 Williemccool.[69] On Mars, the landing site of the rover Spirit was named Columbia Memorial Station, and included a memorial plaque to the Columbia crew mounted on the back of the high gain antenna. A complex of seven hills east of the Spirit landing site was dubbed the Columbia Hills; each of the seven hills was individually named for a member of the crew, and Husband Hill in particular was ascended and explored by the rover. In 2006, the IAU approved naming of a cluster of seven small craters in the Apollo basin on the far side of the Moon after the astronauts.[70] Back on Earth, NASA's National Scientific Balloon Facility was renamed the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility.\\r\\nOther tributes included the decision by Amarillo, Texas, to rename its airport Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport after the Amarillo native. Washington State Route 904 was renamed Lt. Michael P. Anderson Memorial Highway, as it runs through Cheney, Washington, the town where he graduated from high school. A newly constructed elementary school located on Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane, Washington, was named Michael Anderson Elementary School. Anderson had attended fifth grade at Blair Elementary, the base's previous elementary school, while his father was stationed there. A mountain peak near Kit Carson Peak and Challenger Point in the Sangre de Cristo Range was renamed Columbia Point, and a dedication plaque was placed on the point in August, 2003. Seven dormitories were named in honor of Columbia crew members at the Florida Institute of Technology, Creighton University, The University of Texas at Arlington, and the Columbia Elementary School in the Brevard County School District. The Huntsville City Schools in Huntsville, Alabama, a city strongly associated with NASA, named their most recent high school Columbia High School as a memorial to the crew. A Department of Defense school in Guam was renamed Commander William C. McCool Elementary School.[71] The City of Palmdale, California, the birthplace of the entire shuttle fleet, changed the name of the thoroughfare Avenue M to Columbia Way. In Avondale, Arizona, the Avondale Elementary School where Michael Anderson's sister worked had sent a T-shirt with him into space. It was supposed to have an assembly when he returned from space. The school was later renamed Michael Anderson Elementary.\\r\\n The first dedicated meteorological satellite launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on 2 September 2002, named Metsat-1, was later renamed Kalpana-1 by Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in memory of India-born Kalpana Chawla.\\r\\nIn October 2004, both houses of Congress passed a resolution authored by US Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard and co-sponsored by the entire contingent of California representatives to Congress changing the name of Downey, California's Space Science Learning Center to the Columbia Memorial Space Science Learning Center. The facility is located at the former manufacturing site of the space shuttles, including Columbia and Challenger.[72]\\r\\nThe US Air Force's Squadron Officer School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, renamed their auditorium in Husband's honor. He was a graduate of the program. The US Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California named its pilot lounge for Husband.\\r\\nNASA named a supercomputer \\"Columbia\\" in the crew's honor in 2004. It was located at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division at Ames Research Center on Moffett Federal Airfield near Mountain View, California. The first part of the system, built in 2003, known as \\"Kalpana\\" was dedicated to Chawla, who worked at Ames prior to joining the Space Shuttle program.[73]\\r\\nA US Navy compound at a major coalition military base in Afghanistan is named Camp McCool. In addition, the athletic field at McCool's alma mater, Coronado High School in Lubbock, Texas, was renamed the Willie McCool Track and Field.\\r\\nA proposed reservoir in Cherokee County in Eastern Texas is to be named Lake Columbia.[74]\\r\\nIlan Ramon High School was established in 2006 in Hod HaSharon, Israel, in tribute to the first Israeli astronaut.[75] The school's symbol shows the planet Earth with an aircraft orbiting around it.[76]\\r\\nThe National Naval Medical Center dedicated Laurel Clark Memorial Auditorium on July 11, 2003.[77] Gamma Phi Beta sorority, of which Clark was a member, created the Laurel Clark Foundation in her honor.[78]\\r\\nPS 58 in Staten Island, New York, was named Space Shuttle Columbia School in honor of the failed mission.[79]\\r\\nThe Challenger Columbia Stadium in League City, Texas is named in honor of the victims of both the Columbia disaster as well as the Challenger disaster in 1986.\\r\\nColumbia Colles, a range of hills on Pluto discovered by the New Horizons spacecraft in July 2015, was named in honor of the victims of the disaster.[80]\\r\\nA starship on Star Trek: Enterprise was named U.S.S. Columbia in honor of the Columbia.\\r\\nFollowing the loss of Columbia, the space shuttle program was suspended.[55] The further construction of the International Space Station (ISS) was also delayed, as the space shuttles were the only available delivery vehicle for station modules. The station was supplied using Russian unmanned Progress ships, and crews were exchanged using Russian-manned Soyuz spacecraft, and forced to operate on a skeleton crew of two.[81][82]\\r\\nLess than a year after the accident, President Bush announced the Vision for Space Exploration, calling for the space shuttle fleet to complete the ISS, with retirement by the year 2010 following the completion of the ISS, to be replaced by a newly developed Crew Exploration Vehicle for travel to the Moon and Mars.[83] NASA planned to return the space shuttle to service around September 2004; that date was pushed back to July 2005.\\r\\nOn July 26, 2005, at 10:39?am EST, Space Shuttle Discovery cleared the tower on the \\"Return to Flight\\" mission STS-114, marking the shuttle's return to space. Overall the STS-114 flight was highly successful, but a similar piece of foam from a different portion of the tank was shed, although the debris did not strike the Orbiter. Due to this, NASA once again grounded the shuttles until the remaining problem was understood and a solution implemented.[55] After delaying their re-entry by two days due to adverse weather conditions, Commander Eileen Collins and Pilot James M. Kelly returned Discovery safely to Earth on August 9, 2005. Later that same month, the external tank construction site at Michoud was damaged by Hurricane Katrina.[84] At the time, there was concern that this would set back further shuttle flights by at least two months and possibly more.\\r\\nThe actual cause of the foam loss on both Columbia and Discovery was not determined until December 2005, when x-ray photographs of another tank showed that thermal expansion and contraction during filling, not human error, caused cracks that led to foam loss. NASA's Hale formally apologized to the Michoud workers who had been blamed for the loss of Columbia for almost three years.[14]\\r\\nThe second \\"Return to Flight\\" mission, STS-121, launched on July 4, 2006, at 2:37:55?pm (EDT), after two previous launch attempts were scrubbed because of lingering thunderstorms and high winds around the launch pad. The launch took place despite objections from its chief engineer and safety head. This mission increased the ISS crew to three. A 5-inch (130?mm) crack in the foam insulation of the external tank gave cause for concern; however, the Mission Management Team gave the go for launch.[85] Space Shuttle Discovery touched down successfully on July 17, 2006 at 9:14:43?am (EDT) on Runway 15 at the Kennedy Space Center.\\r\\nOn August 13, 2006, NASA announced that STS-121 had shed more foam than they had expected. While this did not delay the launch for the next mission ÿ STS-115, originally set to lift off on August 27 [86] ÿ the weather and other technical glitches did, with a lightning strike, Hurricane Ernesto and a faulty fuel tank sensor combining to delay the launch until September 9. On September 19, landing was delayed an extra day to examine Atlantis after objects were found floating near the shuttle in the same orbit. When no damage was detected, Atlantis landed successfully on September 21.\\r\\nThe Columbia Crew Survival Investigation Report released by NASA on December 30, 2008, made further recommendations to improve a crew's survival chances on future space vehicles, such as the (planned) Orion spacecraft. These included improvements in crew restraints, finding ways to deal more effectively with catastrophic cabin depressurization, more \\"graceful degradation\\" of vehicles during a disaster so that crews will have a better chance at survival, and automated parachute systems.[59]\\r\\nAfter the shuttle's breakup, there were some initial fears that terrorists might have been involved, but no evidence of that has ever surfaced.[87] Security surrounding the launch and landing of the space shuttle had been increased because the crew included the first Israeli astronaut.[88] The Merritt Island launch facility, like all sensitive government areas, had increased security after the September 11 attacks.\\r\\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported that an amateur astronomer had taken a five-second exposure that appeared to show \\"a purplish line near the shuttle\\", resembling lightning, during re-entry.[89] The CAIB report concluded that the image was the result of \\"camera vibrations during a long-exposure\\".[90]\\r\\nIn response to the disaster, FX canceled its scheduled airing two nights later of the 1998 film Armageddon, in which the space shuttle Atlantis is depicted as being destroyed by asteroid fragments.[91] In a hoax inspired by the destruction of Columbia, some images that were purported to be satellite photographs of the shuttle's \\"explosion\\" turned out to be screen captures from the space shuttle destruction scene of Armageddon.\\r\\nThe 2003 album Bananas by Deep Purple includes \\"Contact Lost\\", an instrumental piece written by guitarist Steve Morse in remembrance of the loss.

He played his entire 14-year baseball career for the Minnesota Twins (1981ÿ1994). Hrbek batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He hit the first home run in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome on April 3, 1982, in an exhibition game against the Phillies.[1] Fans knew Hrbek as an outstanding defensive player, perennial slugger, and charismatic hometown favorite. Former Twins pitcher Jim Kaat considered Hrbek to be the best defensive first baseman he had ever seen.[2] Hrbek attended Kennedy High School in Bloomington, Minnesota.\\r\\n\\r\\nKent Hrbek was drafted by his hometown Minnesota Twins in the 17th round of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft and spent the next three seasons working his way up the Twins' organizational ladder where he would hit 47 home runs and 111 runs batted in while hitting .318 in 253 minor league games. In 1979, Hrbek played 24 games for the rookie league Elizabethton Twins in the Appalachian Rookie League before spending the next two seasons playing A ball, first for the Wisconsin Rapids Twins in the Midwest League and then the Visalia Oaks in the California League.[3] Hrbek made his major league debut on August 24, 1981, at Yankee Stadium, hitting a game-winning home run in the 12th inning off New York reliever, and future Twin, George Frazier.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter his \\"cup of coffee\\" at the end of the '81 season, Hrbek would make the team out of spring training and come into his own in 1982, playing well for Twins manager Billy Gardner. Finishing his rookie season hitting .301 with 23 home runs and 92 RBI, Hrbek would finish second in the Rookie of the Year voting (to future Hall of Famer Cal Ripken, Jr.) and be selected to his only All-Star game.[5] Although the Twins would finish 60-102, Hrbek and fellow rookies Tim Laudner, Gary Gaetti, Tom Brunansky, Randy Bush, and Frank Viola would make up the nucleus of the 1987 World Series team. Falling off slightly in his sophomore year (.297, 16 HR, 84 RBI), Hrbek would come up big in 1984, finishing the season hitting .311 (his 2nd highest career batting average) with 27 HR (his 3rd highest total), 107 RBI (his highest career total), 174 hits (his highest total), and 80 runs (his third highest total). During arguably his career year, Hrbek would power the Twins all season and the team would surprise the rest of the American League West by battling for the division crown. Although the team was as close as 0.5 games out of first place at 81-75, the Twins faded fast, losing their last six games and finishing in a tie with the California Angels, three games behind the Kansas City Royals. After the season, Hrbek was recognized for his performance, and the team's surprise September run, by his finishing second in the American League Most Valuable Player balloting to Detroit Tigers' closer Willie Hernndez.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of his most memorable moments were during the 1987 season. He hit a career best 34 home runs to help the Twins win the AL West. Although he hit only .208, Hrbek was instrumental in capturing the World Series Championship, as he hit a grand slam in Game 6 off Cardinals reliever Ken Dayley that essentially sealed the win for the Twins. In 1991 he again helped the Twins to win the World Series after having a typical Hrbek season ÿ hitting .284 with 20 home runs and 84 RBI. The Twins had finished the previous season in last place, as had their Series opponent the Atlanta Braves, which prompted the media to coin the phrase \\"Worst to First World Series\\". Hrbek's offense turned stale after his home run in Game 1 and he hit only .115 for the series with the one home run and 2 RBI. However, in Game 7, with the score still tied 0-0 in the 8th inning, Hrbek executed a very uncommon 3-2-3 bases-loaded double play with catcher Brian Harper that saved the Twins against the Braves' biggest threat of the game. The Twins eventually won the game 1-0, with Gene Larkin hitting a bases-loaded single to center field that scored Dan Gladden in the bottom of the 10th inning.\\r\\n\\r\\nHrbek was involved in a controversial play with Ron Gant in Game 2 of the 1991 Series. While Gant was coming back to first base after widely rounding the base on a single, Hrbek applied a tag on Gant's leg and Gant ran into Hrbek. The umpire, Drew Coble, called Gant out, ruling that forward progress would have caused Gant to step off the bag.[6] Gant angrily disputed the call and had to be restrained when Coble refused to change it. The move was later nicknamed the \\"T-Rex Tag\\", after Hrbek jokingly speculated on a post-baseball career in professional wrestling using the name Tyrannosaurus Rex. When the Series moved to Atlanta, Braves fans jeered him, and Hrbek received much hate mail, including a death threat.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough he was a key part of both World Series teams, Hrbek was largely ineffective at the plate, hitting only .154 in 24 post-season games with only 3 home runs and 12 RBI. Hrbek was one of seven Twins to be part of both the 1987 and 1991 World Series teams. The other six were Randy Bush, Greg Gagne, Kirby Puckett, Al Newman, Gene Larkin, who made the winning hit in Game 7 of the 1991 series, and Dan Gladden, who was the runner Larkin scored with that hit.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrequently injured (though seldom seriously), Hrbek retired after the players strike in 1994, citing his nagging injury problems and desire to spend more time with his wife and daughter at their home in Bloomington, Minnesota. Despite operating in the same lineup as Kirby Puckett for all but two years of his career, and his long and close association with Puckett, Hrbek's numbers never approached those of the center fielder, and it is generally agreed that his career, while long and productive, was not Baseball Hall of Fame material ÿ on the list of similar good-but-not-great players such as Eric Karros, Will Clark, Greg Luzinski, David Justice, and Vic Wertz.[8] In 2000, his first year of Hall of Fame eligibility, Hrbek garnered only 5 votes, nowhere near the 5% minimum threshold for continued eligibility, and is thus ineligible for the Hall of Fame unless voted in by the Veterans Committee. His first year of Veterans' Committee eligibility was 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nKent Hrbek's number 14 was retired by the Twins in 1995, becoming at the time only the fourth (along with Harmon Killebrew, Rod Carew, and Tony Oliva) in franchise history. Hrbek was also inducted into the Minnesota Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. He was also one of few players then (which is even rarer today) who played out his entire career with only one team.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, the Twins established their own \\"Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame\\" and Hrbek was one of six former Twins inducted into the initial class. The 2000 class also included MLB Hall of Famers Rod Carew, Harmon Killebrew and Kirby Puckett, player and Twins coach Tony Oliva, and former owner Calvin Griffith.\\r\\n\\r\\nHrbek is an avid hunter and fisherman, particularly in his home state of Minnesota. He hosted an outdoor sports program on FOX 9 called Kent Hrbek Outdoors from 2004ÿ2010.[9] Hrbek is a perennial pitchman for Twin Cities-area HVAC company Carrier Heating and Air Conditioning. He has a series of baseball fields named after him in his hometown of Bloomington. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince Kent Hrbek's father died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or \\"Lou Gehrig's disease\\") in 1982, he has worked to increase awareness of the disease. Hrbek hosts an annual charity golf tournament in Minnesota to raise money for ALS research, and makes many public appearances on behalf of the cause. He also participates in an annual fundraising event called the \\"Black Woods Blizzard Tour\\", a snowmobile excursion around northern Minnesota that raises money to fight the deadly disease. Hrbek and his wife, Jeanie Hrbek, are honorary co-chairs of the ALS Association's MN/ND/SD Chapter.[10]","input":"Where did kent hrbek go to high school?"},{"output":"A simple majority","context":"The appointment and confirmation of Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States involves several steps set forth by the United States Constitution, which have been further refined and developed by decades of tradition. Candidates are nominated by the President of the United States and must face a series of hearings in which both the nominee and other witnesses make statements and answer questions before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which can vote to send the nomination to the full United States Senate. Confirmation by the Senate allows the President to formally appoint the candidate to the court.\\r\\n\\r\\nSenate cloture rules historically required a two-thirds affirmative vote to advance nominations to a vote; this was changed to a three-fifths supermajority in 1975. In November 2013, the then-Democratic Senate majority eliminated the filibuster for executive branch nominees and judicial nominees except for Supreme Court nominees by invoking the so called nuclear option. In April 2017, the Republican Senate majority applied the nuclear option to Supreme Court nominations as well,[1] enabling the nominations of Trump nominees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to proceed to a vote.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle Two of the United States Constitution requires the President of the United States to nominate Supreme Court Justices and, with Senate confirmation, requires Justices to be appointed. This was for the division of power between the President and Senate by the founders, who wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nhe shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint ... Judges of the supreme Court...\\r\\nUpon the election of a new President, incoming White House staff prepare profiles of possible candidates for the Supreme Court, considering not only judges but also politicians and other individuals whom they consider appropriate for the role. Besides considering national figures whose views are well-known, they consider others who are less recognized. They go through published rulings, articles, speeches, and other background material to get an idea of candidates' values and views on constitutional issues. Age, health, race, gender, education, and likelihood of confirmation are also factored into considerations. Once a Supreme Court vacancy opens, the President discusses the candidates with advisors. Senators also call the President with suggestions. In turn, the White House lobbies key senators for their votes. After a first choice is decided, the candidate is contacted and called on by the President to serve on the highest court. Staffers send a vetting form for the candidate to fill out. They visit the candidate to go over tax records and payments to domestic help. A formal FBI background check is conducted. Candidates whom the President has never met are interviewed by White House officials before being sent to the White House to be interviewed in person by the President. After making a final decision, the President calls the candidate, who is told to prepare a statement for an appearance in front of the national press for the President's formal announcement. The nominee then meets with senators and prepares for confirmation hearings.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological views.[4] In many cases, however, a Justice's decisions may be contrary to what the nominating President anticipated. A famous instance was Chief Justice Earl Warren; President Dwight D. Eisenhower expected him to be a conservative judge, but his decisions are arguably among the most liberal in the Court's history. Eisenhower later called the appointment \\"the biggest damn fool mistake I ever made\\".[5]  Another Justice whose decisions ran contrary to what was believed to be his ideology was David Souter, who was nominated to the high court in 1990 by President George H. W. Bush.  Many pundits and politicians at the time expected Souter to be a conservative; however, after becoming a Justice, his opinions generally fell on the liberal side of the political spectrum.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the Constitution does not set any qualifications for service as a Justice, the President may nominate any individual to serve on the Court. However, that person must receive the confirmation of the Senate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn modern times, the confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from special-interest groups, many of which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee, depending on whether the nominee's track record aligns with the group's views.[citation needed] The Senate Judiciary Committee conducts hearings, questioning nominees to determine their suitability. By convention, nominees avoid revealing too much about their views on potential cases that may come before the Court.[citation needed] At the close of confirmation hearings, the Committee votes on whether the nomination should go to the full Senate with a positive, negative or neutral report.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Committee's practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent, beginning with Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925. Some western senators were concerned with his links to Wall Street and expressed their opposition when Stone was nominated. Stone proposed what was then the novelty of appearing before the Judiciary Committee to answer questions; his testimony helped secure a confirmation vote with very little opposition. The second nominee to appear before the Committee was Felix Frankfurter, who only addressed (at the Committee's request) what he considered to be slanderous allegations against him.[7] The modern practice of the Committee questioning nominees on their judicial views began with the nomination of John Marshall Harlan II in 1955; the nomination came shortly after the Court handed down the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, and several Southern senators attempted to block Harlan's confirmation, hence the decision to testify.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the Committee reports out the nomination, the whole Senate considers it. A simple majority vote is required to confirm or to reject a nominee. Prior to 2017, a successful filibuster threat could add the requirement of a supermajority of 60 needed in favor of cloture, which would allow debate to end and force a final vote on confirmation. Rejections are relatively uncommon; the Senate has explicitly rejected twelve Supreme Court nominees in its history. The most recent rejection of a nominee by vote of the full Senate came in 1987, when the Senate refused to confirm Robert Bork.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot everyone nominated by the President has received a floor vote in the Senate. Prior to 2017 a nominee could be filibustered once debate on the nomination had begun in the full Senate. A filibuster indefinitely prolongs the debate, preventing a final vote on the nominee. President Lyndon Johnson's nomination of sitting Associate Justice Abe Fortas to succeed Earl Warren as Chief Justice in 1968 was the first successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. It included both Republican and Democratic senators concerned with Fortas's ethics. President Donald Trump's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the seat left vacant by Antonin Scalia's death was the second. Unlike the Fortas filibuster, however, only Democratic Senators voted against cloture on the Gorsuch nomination, citing his perceived conservative judicial philosophy, and the Republican leadership's prior refusal to take up Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy.[10][11][12] The Republican majority then changed the rules[13] to eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot every Supreme Court nominee has received a floor vote in the Senate. A president may withdraw a nomination before an actual confirmation vote occurs, typically because it is clear that the Senate will reject the nominee; this occurred most recently with the nomination of Harriet Miers in 2006 before Committee hearings had begun, citing concerns about Senate requests during her confirmation process for access to internal Executive Branch documents resulting from her position as White House Counsel. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan withdrew the nomination of Douglas H. Ginsburg because of news reports containing marijuana use allegations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Senate may also fail to act on the nomination, which expires at the end of the session. For example, President Dwight Eisenhower's first nomination of John Marshall Harlan II in November 1954 was not acted on by the Senate; Eisenhower re-nominated Harlan in January 1955, and Harlan was confirmed two months later. Most recently, the Senate failed to act on President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland in March 2016 to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia; the nomination expired in January 2017, and the vacancy was later filled by President Donald J. Trump's appointment of Neil Gorsuch.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore 1981 the approval process of Justices was usually rapid. From the Truman through Nixon administrations, Justices were typically approved within one month. From the Reagan administration to the present, however, the process has taken much longer. According to the Congressional Research Service, the average number of days from nomination to final Senate vote since 1975 is 67 days (2.2 months), while the median is 71 days (or 2.3 months).[16][17] Some believe this is because Congress sees Justices as playing a more political role than in the past.[18] The perceived politicization of the process has drawn criticism. For example, columnist George F. Will termed the defeat of Robert Bork's nomination \\"unjust\\" and, more generally, that the nomination process does \\"not delve deeply into the nominee's jurisprudential thinking.\\"[19] Supreme Court nominations have caused media speculation about whether the judge leans to the left, middle, or right.[20] One indication of the politicized selection process is how much time each nominee spends being questioned under the glare of media coverage; before 1925, nominees were never questioned;[21] after 1955, every nominee has been required to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and answer questions; and the hours spent being grilled have lengthened from single digits (before 1980) to double digits today.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing is a table of the approximate number of hours that media sources estimate were spent on the questioning of Supreme Court nominees since 1925:\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the Senate confirms the nomination by an affirmative vote, the Secretary of the Senate attests to a resolution of confirmation and transmits it to the White House.[25]  The President then prepares and signs a commission, and causes the Seal of the United States Department of Justice to be affixed to the document before the new Justice can take office.[26] The date of commission determines a Justice's seniority.[27] A ceremony is held in which the Justice must take the Constitutional Oath, which is used for every federal and state officeholder below the President, and the Judicial Oath used for federal judges before entering into the execution of their office.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution provides that:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\\r\\nThus, when the Senate is in recess, the President may make a temporary appointment to any office requiring Senate approval, including filling vacancies on the Supreme Court, without the Senate's advice and consent. Such a recess appointee to the Supreme Court holds office only until the end of the next Senate session (always less than two years). To continue to serve thereafter and be compensated for his or her service, the nominee must be formally nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Of the ten Justices who have received recess appointments - two Chief Justices and eight Associate Justices - only Chief Justice John Rutledge was not subsequently confirmed for a regular appointment. No president since Dwight Eisenhower (who made three such appointments) has made a recess appointment to the Supreme Court and the practice has become highly controversial even when applied to lower federal courts. During the 110th Congress, the Democratic leadership of the Senate specifically blocked Republican President George W. Bush from making any recess appointments with the use of pro forma sessions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960 the Senate passed a resolution stating that it was the sense of the Senate that recess appointments to the Supreme Court should not be made except under unusual circumstances.[28] Being a resolution, it has no legally binding effect, but was intended as an expression of the position of the Senate and as a guide to executive actions. The resolution passed by a vote of 48 to 37, mainly along party lines.[28]\\r\\n[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing is a list of recess appointments that have been made to the Supreme Court:[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ability of a president to appoint new justices depends on the occurrence of a vacancy on the Court.  In practice, such vacancies normally occur as the result of an incumbent justices' death, resignation, or retirement.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution provides that justices \\"shall hold their offices during good behavior\\", which is understood to mean that confirmed justices may serve for the remainder of their lives, until death.  Justices may also resign or retire from their offices, and any of these circumstances results in a vacancy which must be filled.  Because justices have indefinite tenure, the timing of future vacancies is unpredictable.  Sometimes vacancies arise in quick succession: in September 1971, associate justices Hugo Black and John Marshall Harlan II both retired, producing two vacancies which were filled in January 1972 by Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist, respectively.  On the other hand, sometimes several years pass between consecutive vacancies.  In August 1994, Harry Blackmun's retirement created a vacancy which was filled by Stephen Breyer.  No further vacancy would occur on the Court until September 2005 when Rehnquist, since promoted to chief justice, died.  This vacancy was filled by current chief justice John Roberts.\\r\\n\\r\\nLess commonly, though with historical precedent, vacancies may occur as a result of Congress changing the size of the Court.  Because the Constitution does not specify the Court's size, it was left to Congress to determine the matter through law, and a small number of statutes have legally changed the size of the Court throughout its history.  Changing the Court's size can have the effect of changing the seats on the Court; a newly created seat brings with it a vacancy which must be filled by an initial officeholder.  The original Judiciary Act of 1789 called for six justices, vacancies promptly filled by the appointments of George Washington, resulting in the Court's first complete composition.  An 1801 act called for the Court to be reduced to five justices upon its next vacancy, but was swiftly obviated by an 1802 act which restored the Court's legal size to six before any such vacancy occurred.  In 1807, the Court's size was increased to seven, creating one new vacancy filled by Thomas Todd.  Again in 1837, the Court's size was increased to nine, the two new vacancies being filled by John Catron and John McKinley.  An 1863 act increased the Court's size to ten, the vacancy being filled by Stephen Johnson Field.  Although an 1866 act provided that the Court's size would be thinned from ten to seven through attrition (and which did result in the elimination of two seats while in effect), a final 1869 act[31] interrupted the plan set forth in 1866: the Court's size shall be nine, the legally prescribed full strength which has stood ever since.  Consequently, one final seat was created and filled by Joseph Bradley.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to expand the Court in 1937, seeking to appoint an additional justice for each incumbent justice who reached the age of 70?years and 6?months and refused retirement; under Roosevelt's proposal, such appointments would continue until the Court reached a maximum size of 15 justices. Ostensibly, the proposal was made to ease the burdens of the docket on the elderly justices, but Roosevelt's actual purpose was to pack the Court with justices who would support New Deal policies and legislation.[32] This plan, usually called the \\"Court-packing Plan\\", failed in Congress and proved a political disaster for Roosevelt.[33] The balance of the Court shifted with the retirement of Willis Van Devanter and the confirmation of Hugo Black in August 1937. By the end of 1941, Roosevelt had appointed seven Supreme Court justices and elevated Harlan Fiske Stone to chief justice.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is constitutionally possible for a justice to be removed from office through Congressional impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate, another possible situation creating a vacancy.  Only one justiceSamuel Chase, late 1804-early 1805has ever been impeached; however, Chase was acquitted by the Senate, and thus not removed from office.  Removal of a justice through an impeachment process has therefore never taken place.  Less substantial efforts towards impeachment of a sitting justice, not reaching a House vote, have occurred more recently: William O. Douglas was twice the subject of hearings, first in 1953 and again in 1970.  No mechanism presently exists for removing a justice who is permanently incapacitated by illness or injury, both unable to resign and unable to resume service.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the unpredictability of vacancies, most presidents have successfully appointed at least one justice. The four exceptions are William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Andrew Johnson, and Jimmy Carter. Harrison died a month after taking office, though his successor John Tyler made an appointment during that presidential term. Taylor likewise died early in his term, although his successor Millard Fillmore also made a Supreme Court nomination before the end of that term. Johnson was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by the 1866 act which reduced the Court's size, mentioned above.

The battle was fought in the straits between the mainland and Salamis, an island in the Saronic Gulf near Athens, and marked the high-point of the second Persian invasion of Greece.\\r\\nTo block the Persian advance, a small force of Greeks blocked the pass of Thermopylae, while an Athenian-dominated Allied navy engaged the Persian fleet in the nearby straits of Artemisium. In the resulting Battle of Thermopylae, the rearguard of the Greek force was annihilated, whilst in the Battle of Artemisium the Greeks had heavy losses and retreated after the loss at Thermopylae. This allowed the Persians to conquer Boeotia and Attica. The Allies prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth whilst the fleet was withdrawn to nearby Salamis Island.\\r\\nAlthough heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were persuaded by the Athenian general Themistocles to bring the Persian fleet to battle again, in the hope that a victory would prevent naval operations against the Peloponnese. The Persian king Xerxes was also eager for a decisive battle. As a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the Persian navy rowed into the Straits of Salamis and tried to block both entrances. In the cramped conditions of the Straits, the great Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganized. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory.\\r\\nXerxes retreated to Asia with much of his army, leaving Mardonius to complete the conquest of Greece. However, the following year, the remainder of the Persian army was decisively beaten at the Battle of Plataea and the Persian navy at the Battle of Mycale. The Persians made no further attempts to conquer the Greek mainland. These battles of Salamis and Plataea thus mark a turning point in the course of the Greco-Persian wars as a whole; from then onward, the Greek poleis would take the offensive. A number of historians believe that a Persian victory would have hamstrung the development of Ancient Greece, and by extension western civilization, and this has led them to argue that Salamis is one of the most significant battles in human history.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian Herodotus. Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History',[6] was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his Enquiries (Greek: ۿ?ϫ; English: (The) Histories) around 440ÿ430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).[7] Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented \\"history\\" as we know it.[7] As Holland has it: \\"For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally.\\"[7]\\r\\nSome subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with Thucydides.[8][9] Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the Siege of Sestos), and therefore evidently felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.[9] Plutarch criticised Herodotus in his essay \\"On the Malignity of Herodotus\\", describing Herodotus as \\"Philobarbaros\\" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.[10] A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read.[11] However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.[12] The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his Historia, but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism.[12] Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.[13]\\r\\nThe Sicilian historian Diodorus Siculus, writing in the 1st century BC in his Bibliotheca Historica, also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian Ephorus. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's.[14] The Greco-Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, Ctesias of Cnidus, and are alluded by other authors, such as the playwright Aeschylus. Archaeological evidence, such as the Serpent Column, also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.[15]\\r\\nThe Greek city-states of Athens and Eretria had supported the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire of Darius I in 499-494 BC, led by the satrap of Miletus, Aristagoras. The Persian Empire was still relatively young, and prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.[16][17] Moreover, Darius was a usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.[16] The Ionian revolt threatened the integrity of his empire, and Darius thus vowed to punish those involved (especially those not already part of the empire).[18][19] Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece.[19] A preliminary expedition under Mardonius, in 492 BC, to secure the land approaches to Greece ended with the re-conquest of Thrace and forced Macedon to become a client kingdom of Persia.[20]\\r\\nIn 491 BC, Darius sent emissaries to all the Greek city-states, asking for a gift of 'earth and water' in token of their submission to him.[21] Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year, the majority of Greek cities duly obliged. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well.[21] This meant that Sparta was also now effectively at war with Persia.[21]\\r\\nDarius thus put together an amphibious task force under Datis and Artaphernes in 490 BC, which attacked Naxos, before receiving the submission of the other Cycladic Islands. The task force then moved on Eretria, which it besieged and destroyed.[22] Finally, it moved to attack Athens, landing at the bay of Marathon, where it was met by a heavily outnumbered Athenian army. At the ensuing Battle of Marathon, the Athenians won a remarkable victory, which resulted in the withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia.[23]\\r\\nDarius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.[17] Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I.[24] Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece.[25] Since this was to be a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, stock-piling and conscription.[25] Xerxes decided that the Hellespont would be bridged to allow his army to cross to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC).[26] These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any other contemporary state.[26] By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army which Xerxes had mustered at Sardis marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges.[27]\\r\\nThe Athenians had also been preparing for war with the Persians since the mid-480s BC, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, under the guidance of the Athenian politician Themistocles, to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be necessary for the Greeks to fight the Persians.[28] However, the Athenians did not have the manpower to fight on land and sea; and therefore combatting the Persians would require an alliance of Greek city states. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water, but made the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta.[29] Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC,[30] and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed. It had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.[31]\\r\\nInitially the 'congress' agreed to defend the narrow Vale of Tempe, on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes's advance.[32] However, once there, they were warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be bypassed through the pass by the modern village of Sarantaporo, and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelming, the Greeks retreated.[33] Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont. A second strategy was therefore adopted by the allies. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnese) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual strategy was adopted by the congress.[34] However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, whilst the women and children of Athens had been evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.[35]\\r\\nFamously, the much smaller Greek army held the pass of Thermopylae against the Persians for three days before being outflanked by a mountain path. Much of the Greek army retreated, before the Spartans and Thespians who had continued to block the pass were surrounded and killed.[36] The simultaneous Battle of Artemisium was up to that point a stalemate;[37] however, when news of Thermopylae reached them, the Allied fleet also retreated, since holding the straits of Artemisium was now a moot point.[38]\\r\\nThe Allied fleet now rowed from Artemisium to Salamis to assist with the final evacuation of Athens. En route Themistocles left inscriptions addressed to the Ionian Greek crews of the Persian fleet on all springs of water that they might stop at, asking them to defect to the Allied cause. Following Thermopylae, the Persian army proceeded to burn and sack the Boeotian cities that had not surrendered, Plataea and Thespiae, before marching on the now evacuated city of Athens.[39] The Allies (mostly Peloponnesian) prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, demolishing the single road that led through it, and building a wall across it.[40]\\r\\nThis strategy was flawed, however, unless the Allied fleet was able to prevent the Persian fleet from transporting troops across the Saronic Gulf. In a council-of-war called once the evacuation of Athens was complete, the Corinthian naval commander Adeimantus argued that the fleet should assemble off the coast of the Isthmus in order to achieve such a blockade.[41] However, Themistocles argued in favour of an offensive strategy, aimed at decisively destroying the Persians' naval superiority. He drew on the lessons of Artemisium, pointing out that \\"battle in close conditions works to our advantage\\".[41] He eventually won through, and the Allied navy remained off the coast of Salamis.[42]\\r\\nThe time-line for Salamis is difficult to establish with any certainty.[43] Herodotus presents the battle as though it occurred directly after the capture of Athens, but nowhere explicitly states as much. If Thermopylae/Artemisium occurred in September, then this may be the case, but it is probably more likely that the Persians spent two or three weeks capturing Athens, refitting the fleet, and resupplying.[43] Clearly though, at some point after capturing Athens, Xerxes held a council of war with the Persian fleet; Herodotus says this occurred at Phalerum.[44] Artemisia, queen of Halicarnassus and commander of its naval squadron in Xerxes's fleet, tried to convince him to wait for the Allies to surrender believing that battle in the straits of Salamis was an unnecessary risk.[44] Nevertheless, Xerxes and his chief advisor Mardonius pressed for an attack.[45]\\r\\nIt is difficult to explain exactly what eventually brought about the battle, assuming that neither side simply attacked without forethought.[43] Clearly though, at some point just before the battle, new information began to reach Xerxes of rifts in the allied command; the Peloponnesians wished to evacuate from Salamis while they still could.[46] This alleged rift amongst the Allies may have simply been a ruse, in order to lure the Persians to battle.[47] Alternatively, this change in attitude amongst the Allies (who had waited patiently off the coast of Salamis for at least a week while Athens was captured) may have been in response to Persian offensive maneuvers.[43] Possibly, a Persian army had been sent to march against the Isthmus in order to test the nerve of the fleet.[43][47]\\r\\nEither way, when Xerxes received this news, he ordered his fleet to go out on patrol off the coast Salamis, blocking the southern exit.[47] Then, at dusk, he ordered them to withdraw, possibly in order to tempt the Allies into a hasty evacuation.[47] That evening Themistocles now attempted what appears to have been a spectacularly successful use of disinformation. He sent a servant, Sicinnus, to Xerxes, with a message proclaiming that Themistocles was \\"on the king's side and prefers that your affairs prevail, not the Hellenes\\".[48] Themistocles claimed that the Allied command was in-fighting, that the Peloponnesians were planning to evacuate that very night, and that to gain victory all the Persians need to do was to block the straits.[48] In performing this subterfuge, Themistocles seems to have been trying to bring about exactly the opposite; to lure the Persian fleet into the Straits.[47] This was exactly the kind of news that Xerxes wanted to hear; that the Athenians might be willing to submit to him, and that he would be able to destroy the rest of the Allied fleet.[47] Xerxes evidently took the bait, and the Persian fleet was sent out that evening to effect this block.[49] Xerxes ordered a throne to be set up on the slopes of Mount Aigaleo (overlooking the straits), in order to watch the battle from a clear vantage point, and so as to record the names of commanders who performed particularly well.[50]\\r\\nAccording to Herodotus, the Allies spent the evening heatedly debating their course of action.[51] The Peloponnesians were in favour of evacuating,[52] and at this point Themistocles attempted his ruse with Xerxes.[48] It was only when Aristides, the exiled Athenian general arrived that night, followed by some deserters from the Persians, with news of the deployment of the Persian fleet,[53][54] that the Peloponnesians accepted that they could not escape, and so would fight.[55]\\r\\nHowever, Peloponnesians may have been party to Themistocles's stratagem, so serenely did they accept that they would now have to fight at Salamis.[56] The Allied navy was thus able to prepare properly for battle the forthcoming day, whilst the Persians spent the night fruitlessly at sea, searching for the alleged Greek evacuation. The next morning, the Persians rowed into the straits to attack the Greek fleet; it is not clear when, why or how this decision was made, but it is clear that they did take the battle to the Allies.[50]\\r\\nHerodotus reports that there were 378 triremes in the Allied fleet, and then breaks the numbers down by city state (as indicated in the table).[57] However, his numbers for the individual contingents only add up to 371. He does not explicitly say that all 378 fought at Salamis (\\"All of these came to the war providing triremes...The total number of ships...was three hundred and seventy-eight\\"),[1] and he also says that the Aeginetans \\"had other manned ships, but they guarded their own land with these and fought at Salamis with the thirty most seaworthy\\".[58] Thus it has been supposed that the difference between the numbers is accounted for a garrison of 12 ships left at Aegina.[59] According to Herodotus, two more ships defected from the Persians to the Greeks, one before Artemisium and one before Salamis, so the total complement at Salamis would have been 373 (or 380).[60]\\r\\nAccording to the Athenian playwright Aeschylus, who actually fought at Salamis, the Greek fleet numbered 310 triremes (the difference being the number of Athenian ships).[61] Ctesias claims that the Athenian fleet numbered only 110 triremes, which ties in with Aeschylus's numbers.[62] According to Hyperides, the Greek fleet numbered only 220.[63] The fleet was effectively under the command of Themistocles, but nominally led by the Spartan nobleman Eurybiades, as had been agreed at the congress in 481 BC.[64] Although Themistocles had tried to claim leadership of the fleet, the other city states with navies objected, and so Sparta (which had no naval tradition) was given command of the fleet as a compromise.[64]\\r\\nPlain numbers represent triremes; those indicated in parentheses are penteconters (fifty-oared galleys)\\r\\nAccording to Herodotus, the Persian fleet initially numbered 1,207 triremes.[70] However, by his reckoning they lost approximately a third of these ships in a storm off the coast of Magnesia,[71] 200 more in a storm off the coast of Euboea,[72] and at least 50 ships to Allied action at the Battle of Artemisium.[72][73] Herodotus claims that these losses were replaced in full,[74] but only mentions 120 ships from the Greeks of Thrace and nearby islands as reinforcements.[75] Aeschylus, who fought at Salamis, also claims that he faced 1,207 warships there, of which 207 were \\"fast ships\\".[76] Diodorus[77] and Lysias[78] independently claim there were 1,200 ships in the Persian fleet assembled at Doriskos in the spring of 480 BC. The number of 1,207 (for the outset only) is also given by Ephorus,[79] while his teacher Isocrates claims there were 1,300 at Doriskos and 1,200 at Salamis.[80][81] Ctesias gives another number, 1,000 ships,[62] while Plato, speaking in general terms refers to 1,000 ships and more.[82]\\r\\nThe number 1,207 appears very early in the historical record (472 BC), and the Greeks appear to have genuinely believed they faced that many ships. Because of the consistency in the ancient sources, some modern historians are inclined to accept 1,207 as the size of the initial Persian fleet;[83][84][85] others reject this number, with 1,207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad, and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.[85][86][87] However, very few appear to accept that there were this many ships at Salamis: most favour a number in the range 600-800.[2][3][4] This is also the range given by adding the approximate number of Persian ships after Artemisium (~550) to the reinforcements (120) quantified by Herodotus.[75]\\r\\nThe overall Persian strategy for the invasion of 480 BC was to overwhelm the Greeks with a massive invasion force, and complete the conquest of Greece in a single campaigning season.[88] Conversely, the Greeks sought to make the best use of their numbers by defending restricted locations and to keep the Persians in the field for as long as possible. Xerxes had obviously not anticipated such resistance, or he would have arrived earlier in the campaigning season (and not waited 4 days at Thermopylae for the Greeks to disperse).[89] Time was now of the essence for the Persians ÿ the huge invasion force could not be reasonably supported indefinitely, nor probably did Xerxes wish to be at the fringe of his empire for so long.[90] Thermopylae had shown that a frontal assault against a well defended Greek position was useless; with the Allies now dug in across the narrow Isthmus, there was little chance of conquering the rest of Greece by land.[91] However, as equally demonstrated by Thermopylae, if the Greeks could be outflanked, their smaller numbers of troops could be destroyed.[92] Such an outflanking of the Isthmus required the use of the Persian navy, and thus the destruction of the Allied navy. Therefore, if Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy, he would be in a strong position to force a Greek surrender; this seemed the only hope of concluding the campaign in that season.[90] Conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by crippling the Persian fleet, the Greeks could effectively thwart the invasion.[93]\\r\\nHowever, it was strategically not necessary for the Persians to actually fight this battle at Salamis.[92] According to Herodotus, Queen Artemisia of Caria pointed this out to Xerxes in the run-up to Salamis. Artemisia suggested that fighting at sea was an unnecessary risk, recommending instead:\\r\\nIf you do not hurry to fight at sea, but keep your ships here and stay near land, or even advance into the Peloponnese, then, my lord, you will easily accomplish what you had in mind on coming here. The Hellenes are not able to hold out against you for a long time, but you will scatter them, and they will each flee to their own cities.[94]\\r\\nThe Persian fleet was still large enough to both bottle up the Allied navy in the straits of Salamis, and send ships to land troops in the Peloponnese.[92] However, in the final reckoning, both sides were prepared to stake everything on a naval battle, in the hope of decisively altering the course of the war.[93]\\r\\nThe Persians were at a significant tactical advantage, outnumbering the Allies, but also having \\"better sailing\\" ships.[95] The \\"better sailing\\" that Herodotus mentions was probably due to the superior seamanship of the crews;[95] most of the Athenian ships (and therefore the majority of the fleet) were newly built as according to Themistocles' request to the Athenians to build a fleet of 200 triremes in 483 BC, and had inexperienced crews. It is important to note that despite the inexperienced crew on part of the Athenians, these newly constructed triremes would ultimately prove crucial in the forthcoming conflict with Persia.[96] The most common naval tactics in the Mediterranean area at the time were ramming (triremes being equipped with a ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines (which essentially turned a sea battle into a land one).[97] The Persians and Asiatic Greeks had by this time begun to use a manoeuver known as diekplous. It is not entirely clear what this was, but it probably involved rowing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side.[97] This maneuver would have required skilled crews, and therefore the Persians would have been more likely to employ it; the Allies however, developed tactics specifically to counter this.[97]\\r\\nThere has been much debate as to the nature of the Allied fleet compared to the Persian fleet. Much of this centres on the suggestion, from Herodotus, that the Allied ships were heavier, and by implication less maneuverable.[98] The source of this heaviness is uncertain; possibly the Allied ships were bulkier in construction, or that the ships were water-logged since they had not been dried out in the winter (though there is no real evidence for either suggestion).[97] Another suggestion is that the heaviness was caused by the weight of fully armored hoplite marines (20 fully armored hoplites would have weighed 2 tons).[97] This 'heaviness', whatever its cause, would further reduce the likelihood of them employing the diekplous.[97] It is therefore probable that the Allies had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them (at the cost of making the ships even heavier).[97] Indeed, Herodotus refers to the Greeks capturing ships at Artemisium, rather than sinking them.[73] It has been suggested that the weight of the Allied ships may also have made them more stable in the winds off the coast of Salamis, and made them less susceptible to ramming (or rather, less liable to sustain damage when rammed).[99]\\r\\nThe Persians preferred a battle in the open sea, where they could better utilize their superior seamanship and numbers.[50] For the Greeks, the only realistic hope of a decisive victory was to draw the Persians into a constricted area, where their numbers would count for little.[41] The battle at Artemisium had seen attempts to negate the Persian advantage in numbers, but ultimately the Allies may have realised that they needed an even more constricted channel in order to defeat the Persians.[100] Therefore, by rowing into the Straits of Salamis to attack the Greeks, the Persians were playing into the Allies' hands. It seems probable that the Persians would not have attempted this unless the Persians were confident of the collapse of the Allied navy, and thus Themistocles's subterfuge appears to have played a key role in tipping the balance in the favor of the Greeks.[50] Salamis was, for the Persians, an unnecessary battle and a strategic mistake.[92]\\r\\nThe actual battle of Salamis is not well described by the ancient sources, and it is unlikely that anyone (other than perhaps Xerxes) involved in the battle had a clear idea what was happening across the width of the straits.[47][101] What follows is more of a discussion than a definitive account.\\r\\nIn the Allied fleet, the Athenians were on the left, and on the right were probably the Spartans (although Diodorus says it was the Megareans and Aeginetians); the other contingents were in the center.[102][103] The Allied fleet probably formed into two ranks, since the straits would have been too narrow for a single line of ships.[104] Herodotus has the Allied fleet in a line running north-south, probably with the northern flank off the coast of modern-day Saint George's Islet (Ayios Georgis), and the southern flank off the coast of Cape Vavari (part of Salamis).[105] Diodorus suggests the Allied fleet was aligned east-west, spanning the straits between Salamis and Mount Aigaleo; however, it is unlikely that the Allies would have rested one of their flanks against Persian occupied territory.[105]\\r\\nIt seems relatively certain that the Persian fleet was sent out to block the exit from the Straits the evening before the battle. Herodotus clearly believed that the Persian fleet actually entered the Straits at nightfall, planning to catch the Allies as they fled.[106] However, modern historians have greatly debated this point, with some pointing out the difficulties of maneuvering in this confined space by night, and others accepting Herodotus's version.[107][108] There are thus two possibilities; that during the night the Persians simply blocked the exit to the Straits, and then entered the straits in daylight; or that they entered the straits and positioned themselves for battle during the night.[107][108] Regardless of when they attempted it, it seems likely that the Persians pivoted their fleet off the tip of Cape Vavari, so that from an initial east-west alignment (blocking the exit), they came round to a north-south alignment (see diagram).[109] The Persian fleet seems to have been formed into three ranks of ships (according to Aeschylus);[47] with the powerful Phoenician fleet on the right flank next to Mount Aigaleo, the Ionian contingent on the left flank and the other contingents in the centre.[102]\\r\\nDiodorus says that the Egyptian fleet was sent to circumnavigate Salamis, and block the northern exit from the Straits.[110] If Xerxes wanted to trap the Allies completely, this maneuver would have made sense (especially if he was not expecting the Allies to fight).[47] However, Herodotus does not mention this (and possibly alludes to the Egyptian presence in the main battle), leading some modern historians to dismiss it;[109] though again, others accept it as a possibility.[47] Xerxes had also positioned around 400 troops on the island known as Psyttaleia, in the middle of the exit from the straits, in order to kill or capture any Greeks who ended up there (as a result of shipwreck or grounding).[50]\\r\\nRegardless of what time they entered the straits, the Persians did not move to attack the Allies until daylight. Since they were not planning to flee after all, the Allies would have been able to spend the night preparing for battle, and after a speech by Themistocles, the marines boarded and the ships made ready to sail.[55] According to Herodotus, this was dawn, and as the Allies \\"were putting out to sea the barbarians immediately attacked them\\".[55][111] If the Persians only entered the straits at dawn, then the Allies would have had the time to take up their station in a more orderly fashion.[107]\\r\\nAeschylus claims that as the Persians approached (possibly implying that they were not already in the Straits at dawn), they heard the Greeks singing their battle hymn (paean) before they saw the Allied fleet:\\r\\n? ϫ?Ѵ? ?? ?\\r\\n?Ĳ? ϫ?Ѵ?, ?Ĳ?

The Athenians would claim that this was the ship of the Athenian Ameinias of Pallene; the Aeginetans would claim it as one of their ships.[111] The whole Greek line then followed suit and made straight for the disordered Persian battle line.[116]\\r\\nThe details of the rest of the battle are generally sketchy, and no one involved would have had a view of the entire battlefield.[107] Triremes were generally armed with a large ram at the front, with which it was possible to sink an enemy ship, or at least disable it by shearing off the banks of oars on one side.[97][117] If the initial ramming was not successful, marines boarded the enemy ship and something similar to a land battle ensued.[97] Both sides had marines on their ships for this eventuality; the Greeks with fully armed hoplites;[107] the Persians probably with more lightly armed infantry.[118]\\r\\nA king sate on the rocky brow\\r\\nWhich looks o'er sea-born Salamis\\r\\nAnd ships, by thousands, lay below,\\r\\nAnd men in nations;all were his!\\r\\nHe counted them at break of day\\r\\nAnd when the sun set where were they?\\r\\n[119]\\r\\nAcross the battlefield, as the first line of Persian ships was pushed back by the Greeks, they became fouled in the advancing second and third lines of their own ships.[120] On the Greek left, the Persian admiral Ariabignes (a brother of Xerxes)[120] was killed early in the battle; left disorganised and leaderless, the Phoenician squadrons appear to have been pushed back against the coast, many vessels running aground.[107] In the centre, a wedge of Greek ships pushed through the Persians lines, splitting the fleet in two.[107] According to Plutarch, Ariabignes was killed by Ameinias and Socles (Greek: ҷ߰??) of Pallene. When Ariabignes attempted to board on their ship, they hit him with their spears, and thrust him into the sea.[121] Plutarch also mentions that it was Artemisia who recognized Ariabignes' body floating among the shipwrecks and brought it back to Xerxes.[122]\\r\\nHerodotus recounts that Artemisia, the Queen of Halicarnassus, and commander of the Carian contingent, found herself pursued by the ship of Ameinias of Pallene. In her desire to escape, she attacked and rammed another Persian vessel, thereby convincing the Athenian captain that the ship was an ally; Ameinias accordingly abandoned the chase.[123] However, Xerxes, looking on, thought that she had successfully attacked an Allied ship, and seeing the poor performance of his other captains commented that \\"My men have become women, and my women men\\".[124] The friendly ship she sank was a Calyndian ship and the king of the Calyndians, Damasithymos (Greek: ϫϫ?Ĳ?) was on it.[125][126] None of the crew of the Calyndian ship survived.[127]\\r\\nThe Persian fleet began to retreat towards Phalerum, but according to Herodotus, the Aeginetans ambushed them as they tried to leave the Straits.[128] The remaining Persian ships limped back to the harbour of Phalerum and the shelter of the Persian army.[129] The Athenian general Aristides then took a detachment of men across to Psyttaleia to slaughter the garrison that Xerxes had left there.[130] The exact Persian casualties are not mentioned by Herodotus. However, he writes that the next year, the Persian fleet numbered 300 triremes.[131] The number of losses then depends on the number of ships the Persian had to begin with; something in the range of 200ÿ300 seems likely, based on the above estimates for the size of the Persian fleet. According to Herodotus, the Persians suffered many more casualties than the Greeks because most Persians did not know how to swim.[120] Xerxes, sitting on Mount Aigaleo on his throne, witnessed the carnage.[132] Some ship-wrecked Phoenician captains tried to blame the Ionians for cowardice before the end of the battle.[132] Xerxes, in a foul mood, and having just witnessed an Ionian ship capture an Aeginetan ship, had the Phoenicians beheaded for slandering \\"more noble men\\".[132] According to Diodorus, Xerxes \\"put to death those Phoenicians who were chiefly responsible for beginning the flight, and threatened to visit upon the rest the punishment they deserved\\", causing the Phoenicians to sail to Asia when night fell.[133]\\r\\nIn the immediate aftermath of Salamis, Xerxes attempted to build a pontoon bridge or causeway across the straits, in order to use his army to attack the Athenians; however, with the Greek fleet now confidently patrolling the straits, this proved futile.[89] Herodotus tells us that Xerxes held a council of war, at which the Persian general Mardonius tried to make light of the defeat:\\r\\nSire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed because of what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us straightway attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, but if you have resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.[134]\\r\\nFearing that the Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes resolved to do this, taking the greater part of the army with him.[135] Mardonius handpicked the troops who were to remain with him in Greece, taking the elite infantry units and cavalry, to complete the conquest of Greece.[89] All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, however, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly; the Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt city for the winter.[89]\\r\\nThe following year, 479 BC, Mardonius recaptured Athens (the Allied army still preferring to guard the Isthmus). However, the Allies, under Spartan leadership, eventually agreed to try to force Mardonius to battle, and marched on Attica.[136] Mardonius retreated to Boeotia to lure the Greeks into open terrain and the two sides eventually met near the city of Plataea (which had been razed the previous year).[136] There, at the Battle of Plataea, the Greek army won a decisive victory, destroying much of the Persian army and ending the invasion of Greece; whilst at the near-simultaneous Battle of Mycale the Allied fleet destroyed much of the remaining Persian fleet.[136]\\r\\nThe Battle of Salamis marked the turning point in the Greco-Persian wars.[91] After Salamis, the Peloponnese, and by extension Greece as an entity, was safe from conquest; and the Persians suffered a major blow to their prestige and morale (as well as severe material losses).[137] At the following battles of Plataea and Mycale, the threat of conquest was removed, and the Allies were able to go on the counter-offensive.[138] The Greek victory allowed Macedon to revolt against Persian rule; and over the next 30 years, Thrace, the Aegean Islands and finally Ionia would be removed from Persian control by the Allies, or by the Athenian-dominated successor, the Delian League.[139] Salamis started a decisive swing in the balance of power toward the Greeks, which would culminate in an eventual Greek victory, severely reducing Persian power in the Aegean.[140]\\r\\nLike the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, Salamis has gained something of a 'legendary' status (unlike, for instance, the more decisive Battle of Plataea), perhaps because of the desperate circumstances and the unlikely odds.[7] A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis is one of the most significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of Marathon).[5][3][99][101] In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it.[141] This view is based on the premise that much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and democracy are rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece.[7] Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian domination of Greece might have changed the whole trajectory of human history.[5] It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.[142][143][144]\\r\\nMilitarily, it is difficult to draw many lessons from Salamis, because of the uncertainty about what actually happened. Once again the Allies chose their ground well in order to negate Persian numbers, but this time (unlike Thermopylae) had to rely on the Persians launching an unnecessary attack for their position to count.[92] (Hale, John R.).\\r\\nSince it brought about that attack, perhaps the most important military lesson is to be found in the use of deception by Themistocles to bring about the desired response from the enemy.[92]\\r\\nOn March 17, 2017, archaeologists announced that they have uncovered the partially submerged remains of the anchorage used by the Greek warships prior to the Battle of Salamis. The site of the ancient mooring site is on the island of Salamis, at the coastal Ambelaki-Kynosaurus site.[145]","input":"Who won the battle of thermopylae and salamis?"},{"output":"dilute their tribal identity and that of their descendants","context":"Encomienda (Spanish pronunciation:?[e?ko?mjenda]) was a labor system, rewarding conquerors with the labor of particular groups of people. It was first established in Spain during the Roman period, but used also following the Christian reconquest of Muslim territory. It was applied on a much larger scale during the Spanish colonization of the Americas and the Philippines. Conquered peoples were considered vassals of the Spanish monarch and the awarding of an encomienda was a grant from the crown to a particular individual. In the conquest era of the sixteenth century, the grants were considered to be a monopoly on the labor of particular Indians, held in perpetuity by the grant holder, called the encomendero, and his descendants.[1]\\r\\nIn the encomienda, the Spanish crown granted a person a specified number of natives from a specific community, with the indigenous leaders in charge of mobilizing the assessed tribute and labor. In turn, encomenderos were to take responsibility for instruction in the Christian faith, protection from warring tribes, suppressing rebellion against Spaniards, protection against pirates, instruction in the Spanish language and development, and maintenance of infrastructure. In return, the natives would provide tributes in the form of metals, maize, wheat, pork or any other agricultural product. In the first decade of Spanish presence in the Caribbean, Spaniards divided up the natives, who in some cases were worked relentlessly.\\r\\nWith the ouster of Christopher Columbus, the Spanish crown sent a royal governor, Fray Nicols de Ovando, who established the formal encomienda system.[2] In many cases natives were forced to do hard labor and subjected to extreme punishment and death if they resisted.[3] However, Queen Isabella of Castile had forbidden Indian slavery and deemed the indigenous \\"free vassals of the crown\\",[4] allowing many natives and Spaniards to appeal to the Real Audiencias.\\r\\nEncomiendas were often characterized by the geographical displacement of those enslaved and the breakup of several communities and family units, but the encomienda in Mexico functioned to rule these free vassals of the crown via existing community hierarchies, with the indigenous not forced permanently from their families, homes, or land.[5]\\r\\nIn the former Inca Empire, for example, the system continued the Incaic (and even pre-Incaic) traditions of extracting tribute in the form of labor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heart of encomienda and encomendero lies in the Spanish verb encomendar, \\"to entrust\\". The encomienda was based on the reconquista institution in which adelantados were given the right to extract tribute from Muslims or other peasants in areas that they had conquered and resettled.[6]\\r\\nThe encomienda system in Spanish America differed from the Peninsular institution in that encomenderos did not own the land on which the natives lived. The system did not entail any direct land tenure by the encomendero; Indian lands were to remain in the possession of their communities.\\r\\nThis right was formally protected by the crown of Castile because the rights of administration in the New World belonged to this crown and not to the Catholic monarchs as a whole.[7]\\r\\nThe first grantees of the encomienda or encomenderos were usually conquerors who received these grants of labor by virtue of participation in a successful conquest. Later, some receiving encomiendas in New Spain (Mexico) were not conquerors themselves but were sufficiently well connected that they received grants.\\r\\nIn his study of the encomenderos of early colonial Mexico, Robert Himmerich y Valencia divides conquerors into those who were part of Hernan Cortes's original expedition, calling them \\"first conquerors\\" and those who were members of the later Narvez expedition who were incorporated into Cortes's contingent, calling them \\"conquerors\\". He designated as pobladores antiguos (old settlers), a group of undetermined number of encomenderos in New Spain, men who were resident in the Caribbean prior to the Spanish conquest of Mexico.\\r\\nHolders of encomiendas also included women and indigenous notables. The daughter of Do?a Marina and conqueror Juan Jaramillo, Do?a Maria Jaramillo, received income from her deceased father's encomiendas.[8] Two of Moctezuma's daughters, Do?a Isabel Moctezuma and her younger sister, Do?a Leonor Moctezuma, were granted extensive encomiendas in perpetuity by Hernan Cortes. Do?a Leonor Moctezuma married in succession two Spaniards, and left the encomiendas to her daughter by her second husband.[9][10][11] Vassal Inca rulers established after the conquest also sought and were granted encomiendas.\\r\\nThe status of humans as wards of the trustees under the encomienda system served to \\"define the status of the Indian population\\": the natives were free men, not slaves or serfs, even though some Spaniards often treated them as poorly as slaves.\\r\\nThe encomienda was essential to the Spanish crown's sustaining its control over North, Central and South America in the first decades after the colonization, because it was the first major organizational law instituted on a continent where disease, war and turmoil reigned. Indeed, the settler-conquistadors knew the fury of the aroused Indian lords; voyagers, explorers, and the friars did not.[12] Initially, the encomienda system was devised to meet the needs of the early agricultural economies in the Caribbean. Later it was adopted to the mining economy of Peru and Upper Peru. The encomienda lasted from the beginning of the sixteenth century to the seventeenth century.[13]\\r\\nIn the Philippines, the encomienda was granted also to the local nobles (principala), through the law enacted by Philip II, on 11 June, 1594. It was used to acquire ownership of large expanses of land, many of which (like Makati) continue to be owned by affluent families.[14]\\r\\nIn 1503, the crown began to formally grant encomiendas to conquistadors and officials as rewards for service to the crown. The system of encomiendas was aided by the crown's organizing the indigenous into small harbors known as reducciones, with the intent of establishing new towns and populations.\\r\\nEach reducci܇n had a native chief responsible for keeping track of the laborers in his community. The encomienda system did not grant people land, but it indirectly aided in the settlers' acquisition of land. As initially defined, the encomendero and his heirs expected to hold these grants in perpetuity. After a major crown reform in 1542, known as the New Laws, encomendero families were restricted to holding the grant for two generations. When the crown attempted to implement the policy in Peru, shortly after the 1535 Spanish conquest, recipients rebelled against the crown, killing the viceroy, Don Blasco N~?ez Vela.\\r\\nIn Mexico, viceroy Don Antonio de Mendoza prudently decided to not institute the reform, citing local circumstances of the potential for a similar conqueror rebellion. To the crown he said, \\"I obey crown authority but do not comply with this order.\\"[15] The encomienda system did eventually come to a legal end in 1720, when the crown made a new attempt at eradicating the institution. The encomenderos were then required to pay remaining encomienda laborers for their work.\\r\\nThe encomiendas became very corrupt and harsh. In the neighborhood of La Concepcion, north of Santo Domingo, the adelantado of Santiago heard rumors of a 15,000-man army planning to stage a rebellion.[16] Upon hearing this, the Adelantado captured the caciques involved and had most of them hanged.\\r\\nLater on, a chieftain named Guarionex laid havoc to the countryside before an Indian-Spanish army of about 3,090 routed the Ciguana forces under his leadership.[17] Although expecting Spanish protection from warring tribes, the islanders sought to join the Spanish forces and, through sheer exasperation, helped the Spaniards deal with the ignorance to the surrounding environment.[18]\\r\\nInitially, the encomendado was supposed to be returned to the crown after two generations; however, in some regions this was frequently overlooked. In Codice Osuna, one of many colonial era Aztec codices (indigenous manuscripts) with native pictorials and alphabetic text in Nahuatl there is evidence that indigenous were well aware of the status of indigenous communities as being held by individual encomenderos and those held by the crown.[19] In 1574, the Viceroy of Peru Diego Lopez de Velasco investigated the encomiendas and concluded that there were 32,000 Spanish families in the New World, 4,000 of which had encomiendas. There were 1,500,000 natives paying tribute, and 5 million \\"civilized\\" natives.[20]\\r\\nThe phrase \\"sin indios no hay Indias\\" (without Indians, there are no Indies ÿ i.e. America), popular in America especially in the 16th century, emphasizes the economic importance and appeal of this indentured labor, even above that of precious metals or other natural resources. Land awardees customarily complained about how \\"worthless\\" territory was, unless it also comprised a population of encomendados.\\r\\nThe encomienda system has been the subject of controversy since 1510. When an Hispaniola encomendero named Valenzuela had Native American leaders killed who had turned in for peace talks in full confidence, the Taino Cacique Enriquillo rebelled against the Spaniards between 1519 and 1533. By 1538, Emperor Charles V realized the seriousness of the Tano revolt and compelled policy changes over the labor of the Indians.[21] Conceding to Las Casas's viewpoint, the peace treaty between the Tanos and the audiencia was eventually disrupted in four to five years. The crown also made two failed attempts to end the abuses of the encomienda system, through the Law of Burgos (1512ÿ13) and the New Law of the Indies (1542). Furthermore, these laws were indeed beneficial to the authorities.\\r\\nThe priest of Hispaniola and former encomendero Bartolom de las Casas underwent a profound conversion after seeing the abuse of the native people. He dedicated his life to writing and lobbying to abolish the encomienda system, which he thought systematically enslaved the native people of the New World. Las Casas participated in an important debate, where he pushed for the enactment of the New Laws and an end to the encomienda system.[22] The Laws of Burgos and the New Laws of the Indies failed in the face of colonial opposition and, in fact, the New Laws were postponed in the Viceroyalty of Peru. When Blasco N~?ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru, tried to enforce the New Laws, which provided for the gradual abolition of the encomienda, many of the encomenderos were unwilling to comply with them and revolted against him.\\r\\nNevertheless, the encomienda system was generally replaced by the crown-managed repartimiento system throughout Spanish America after mid-century.[13] Like the encomienda, the new repartimento did not include the attribution of land to anyone, rather only the allotment of native workers. But they were directly allotted to the crown, who, through a local crown official, would assign them to work for settlers for a set period of time, usually several weeks. The repartimiento was an attempt \\"to reduce the abuses of forced labour\\".[13] As the number of natives declined and mining activities were replaced by agricultural activities in the seventeenth century, the hacienda, or large landed estates in which laborers were directly employed by the hacienda owners (hacendados), arose because land ownership became more profitable than acquisition of forced labor.[23]\\r\\nThe encomienda was strongly based on the encomendado's tribal identity. Mixed-race (Mestizo) individuals, for example, could not by law be subjected to the encomienda. This moved many Amerindians to deliberately seek to dilute their tribal identity and that of their descendants as a way for them to escape the service, by seeking intermarriage with people from different ethnicities, especially Spaniards or Creoles. In this way the encomienda somewhat weakened Amerindians' tribal identification and ethnicity, which in turn diminished the pool of available encomendados.","input":"How were some of the indigenous workers able to escape the encomienda system?"},{"output":"Usain St Leo Bolt","context":"","input":"Who is the first fastest runner in the world?"},{"output":"prodrug","context":"Lisdexamfetamine (contracted from L-lysine-dextroamphetamine) is a prodrug of the central nervous system (CNS) stimulant dextroamphetamine, a phenethylamine of the amphetamine class that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and binge eating disorder.[6][7] Its chemical structure consists of dextroamphetamine coupled with the essential amino acid L-lysine. Lisdexamfetamine itself is inactive prior to its absorption and the subsequent rate-limited enzymatic cleavage of the molecule's L-lysine portion, which produces the active metabolite (dextroamphetamine).\\r\\nLisdexamfetamine can be prescribed for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults and children six and older, as well as for moderate to severe binge eating disorder in adults.[6] The safety and the efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in children with ADHD three to five years old have not been established.[8]\\r\\nLisdexamfetamine is a Class B/Schedule II substance in the United Kingdom and a Schedule II controlled substance in the United States (DEA number 1205)[9] and the aggregate production quota for 2016 in the United States is 29,750 kilograms of anhydrous acid or base.[10] Lisdexamfetamine is currently in Phase III trials in Japan for ADHD.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLisdexamfetamine is used primarily as a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and binge eating disorder;[6] it has similar off-label uses as those of other pharmaceutical amphetamines.[1][2] Individuals over the age of 65 were not commonly tested in clinical trials of lisdexamfetamine for ADHD.[6]\\r\\nLong-term amphetamine exposure at sufficiently high doses in some animal species is known to produce abnormal dopamine system development or nerve damage,[12][13] but, in humans with ADHD, pharmaceutical amphetamines appear to improve brain development and nerve growth.[14][15][16] Reviews of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that long-term treatment with amphetamine decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD, and improves function in several parts of the brain, such as the right caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia.[14][15][16]\\r\\nReviews of clinical stimulant research have established the safety and effectiveness of long-term continuous amphetamine use for the treatment of ADHD.[17][18][19] Randomized controlled trials of continuous stimulant therapy for the treatment of ADHD spanning 2?years have demonstrated treatment effectiveness and safety.[17][19] Two reviews have indicated that long-term continuous stimulant therapy for ADHD is effective for reducing the core symptoms of ADHD (i.e., hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity), enhancing quality of life and academic achievement, and producing improvements in a large number of functional outcomes[note 1] across 9?categories of outcomes related to academics, antisocial behavior, driving, non-medicinal drug use, obesity, occupation, self-esteem, service use (i.e., academic, occupational, health, financial, and legal services), and social function.[18][19] One review highlighted a nine-month randomized controlled trial in children with ADHD that found an average increase of 4.5?IQ points, continued increases in attention, and continued decreases in disruptive behaviors and hyperactivity.[17] Another review indicated that, based upon the longest follow-up studies conducted to date, lifetime stimulant therapy that begins during childhood is continuously effective for controlling ADHD symptoms and reduces the risk of developing a substance use disorder as an adult.[19]\\r\\nCurrent models of ADHD suggest that it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain's neurotransmitter systems;[20] these functional impairments involve impaired dopamine neurotransmission in the mesocorticolimbic projection and norepinephrine neurotransmission in the noradrenergic projections from the locus coeruleus to the prefrontal cortex.[20] Psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine are effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems.[21][20][22] Approximately 80% of those who use these stimulants see improvements in ADHD symptoms.[23] Children with ADHD who use stimulant medications generally have better relationships with peers and family members, perform better in school, are less distractible and impulsive, and have longer attention spans.[24][25] The Cochrane Collaboration's reviews[note 2] on the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults with pharmaceutical amphetamines stated that while these drugs improve short-term symptoms, they have higher discontinuation rates than non-stimulant medications due to their adverse side effects.[27][28] A Cochrane Collaboration review on the treatment of ADHD in children with tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome indicated that stimulants in general do not make tics worse, but high doses of dextroamphetamine could exacerbate tics in some individuals.[29]\\r\\nIn 2015, a systematic review and a meta-analysis of high quality clinical trials found that, when used at low (therapeutic) doses, amphetamine produces modest yet unambiguous improvements in cognition, including working memory, long-term episodic memory, inhibitory control, and some aspects of attention, in normal healthy adults;[30][31] these cognition-enhancing effects of amphetamine are known to be partially mediated through the indirect activation of both dopamine receptor D1 and adrenoceptor ϫ2 in the prefrontal cortex.[21][30] A systematic review from 2014 found that low doses of amphetamine also improve memory consolidation, in turn leading to improved recall of information.[32] Therapeutic doses of amphetamine also enhance cortical network efficiency, an effect which mediates improvements in working memory in all individuals.[21][33] Amphetamine and other ADHD stimulants also improve task saliency (motivation to perform a task) and increase arousal (wakefulness), in turn promoting goal-directed behavior.[21][34][35] Stimulants such as amphetamine can improve performance on difficult and boring tasks and are used by some students as a study and test-taking aid.[21][35][36] Based upon studies of self-reported illicit stimulant use, 5ÿ35% of college students use diverted ADHD stimulants, which are primarily used for performance enhancement rather than as recreational drugs.[37][38][39] However, high amphetamine doses that are above the therapeutic range can interfere with working memory and other aspects of cognitive control.[21][35]\\r\\nAmphetamine is used by some athletes for its psychological and athletic performance-enhancing effects, such as increased endurance and alertness;[40][41] however, non-medical amphetamine use is prohibited at sporting events that are regulated by collegiate, national, and international anti-doping agencies.[42][43] In healthy people at oral therapeutic doses, amphetamine has been shown to increase muscle strength, acceleration, athletic performance in anaerobic conditions, and endurance (i.e., it delays the onset of fatigue), while improving reaction time.[40][44][45] Amphetamine improves endurance and reaction time primarily through reuptake inhibition and effluxion of dopamine in the central nervous system.[44][45][46] Amphetamine and other dopaminergic drugs also increase power output at fixed levels of perceived exertion by overriding a \\"safety switch\\" that allows the core temperature limit to increase in order to access a reserve capacity that is normally off-limits.[45][47][48] At therapeutic doses, the adverse effects of amphetamine do not impede athletic performance;[40][44] however, at much higher doses, amphetamine can induce effects that severely impair performance, such as rapid muscle breakdown and elevated body temperature.[49][50][44]\\r\\nPharmaceutical lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to amphetamine products or any of the formulation's inactive ingredients.[6] It is also contraindicated in patients who have used a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) within the last 14?days.[6][51] Amphetamine products are contraindicated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) in people with a history of drug abuse, heart disease, or severe agitation or anxiety, or in those currently experiencing arteriosclerosis, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, or severe hypertension.[52] The USFDA advises anyone with bipolar disorder, depression, elevated blood pressure, liver or kidney problems, mania, psychosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, seizures, thyroid problems, tics, or Tourette syndrome to monitor their symptoms while taking amphetamine.[52] Amphetamine is classified in US pregnancy category C.[52] This means that detriments to the fetus have been observed in animal studies and adequate human studies have not been conducted; amphetamine may still be prescribed to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.[53] Amphetamine has also been shown to pass into breast milk, so the USFDA advises mothers to avoid breastfeeding when using it.[52] Due to the potential for stunted growth, the USFDA advises monitoring the height and weight of children and adolescents prescribed amphetamines.[52] Prescribing information approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration further contraindicates anorexia.[54]\\r\\nProducts containing lisdexamfetamine have a side effect profile comparable to those containing amphetamine.[6][55]\\r\\nAt normal therapeutic doses, the physical side effects of amphetamine vary widely by age and from person to person.[50] Cardiovascular side effects can include hypertension or hypotension from a vasovagal response, Raynaud's phenomenon (reduced blood flow to the hands and feet), and tachycardia (increased heart rate).[50][41][56] Sexual side effects in males may include erectile dysfunction, frequent erections, or prolonged erections.[50] Abdominal side effects may include abdominal pain, appetite loss, nausea, and weight loss.[1][50][57] Other potential side effects include blurred vision, dry mouth, excessive grinding of the teeth, nosebleed, profuse sweating, rhinitis medicamentosa (drug-induced nasal congestion), reduced seizure threshold, and tics (a type of movement disorder).[sources 1] Dangerous physical side effects are rare at typical pharmaceutical doses.[41]\\r\\nAmphetamine stimulates the medullary respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths.[41] In a normal person at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident.[41] Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating.[41] This effect can be useful in treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control.[41] The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable.[41] If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system);[41] however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed.[41] Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.[1][41]\\r\\nUSFDA-commissioned studies from 2011 indicate that in children, young adults, and adults there is no association between serious adverse cardiovascular events (sudden death, heart attack, and stroke) and the medical use of amphetamine or other ADHD stimulants.[sources 2] However, amphetamine pharmaceuticals are contraindicated in individuals with cardiovascular disease.[sources 3]\\r\\nAt normal therapeutic doses, the most common psychological side effects of amphetamine include increased alertness, apprehension, concentration, initiative, self-confidence, and sociability, mood swings (elated mood followed by mildly depressed mood), insomnia or wakefulness, and decreased sense of fatigue.[50][41] Less common side effects include anxiety, change in libido, grandiosity, irritability, repetitive or obsessive behaviors, and restlessness;[sources 4] these effects depend on the user's personality and current mental state.[41] Amphetamine psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) can occur in heavy users.[49][50][65] Although very rare, this psychosis can also occur at therapeutic doses during long-term therapy.[49][50][66] According to the USFDA, \\"there is no systematic evidence\\" that stimulants produce aggressive behavior or hostility.[50]\\r\\nAmphetamine has also been shown to produce a conditioned place preference in humans taking therapeutic doses,[27][67] meaning that individuals acquire a preference for spending time in places where they have previously used amphetamine.[67][68]\\r\\nAn amphetamine overdose can lead to many different symptoms, but is rarely fatal with appropriate care.[1][51][69] The severity of overdose symptoms increases with dosage and decreases with drug tolerance to amphetamine.[41][51] Tolerant individuals have been known to take as much as 5?grams of amphetamine in a day, which is roughly 100?times the maximum daily therapeutic dose.[51] Symptoms of a moderate and extremely large overdose are listed below; fatal amphetamine poisoning usually also involves convulsions and coma.[49][41] In 2013, overdose on amphetamine, methamphetamine, and other compounds implicated in an \\"amphetamine use disorder\\" resulted in an estimated 3,788?deaths worldwide (3,425ÿ4,145?deaths, 95%?confidence).[note 3][70]\\r\\nPathological overactivation of the mesolimbic pathway, a dopamine pathway that connects the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens, plays a central role in amphetamine addiction.[71][72] Individuals who frequently overdose on amphetamine during recreational use have a high risk of developing an amphetamine addiction, since repeated overdoses gradually increase the level of accumbal FosB, a \\"molecular switch\\" and \\"master control protein\\" for addiction.[73][74][75] Once nucleus accumbens FosB is sufficiently overexpressed, it begins to increase the severity of addictive behavior (i.e., compulsive drug-seeking) with further increases in its expression.[73][76] While there are currently no effective drugs for treating amphetamine addiction, regularly engaging in sustained aerobic exercise appears to reduce the risk of developing such an addiction.[77][78] Sustained aerobic exercise on a regular basis also appears to be an effective treatment for amphetamine addiction;[sources 5] exercise therapy improves clinical treatment outcomes and may be used as a combination therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy, which is currently the best clinical treatment available.[77][79][80]\\r\\nAddiction is a serious risk with heavy recreational amphetamine use but is unlikely to arise from typical long-term medical use at therapeutic doses.[92][93][94] Compared to other amphetamine pharmaceuticals, lisdexamfetamine may have a lower liability for abuse as a recreational drug.[95] Drug tolerance develops rapidly in amphetamine abuse (i.e., a recreational amphetamine overdose), so periods of extended use require increasingly larger doses of the drug in order to achieve the same effect.[96][97]\\r\\nChronic use of amphetamine at excessive doses causes alterations in gene expression in the mesocorticolimbic projection, which arise through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms.[98][99][100] The most important transcription factors[note 4] that produce these alterations are FosB, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B).[99] FosB is the most significant biomolecular mechanism in addiction because the overexpression of FosB in the D1-type medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens is necessary and sufficient[note 5] for many of the neural adaptations and behavioral effects (e.g., expression-dependent increases in drug self-administration and reward sensitization) seen in drug addiction.[73][74][99] Once FosB is sufficiently overexpressed, it induces an addictive state that becomes increasingly more severe with further increases in FosB expression.[73][74] It has been implicated in addictions to alcohol, cannabinoids, cocaine, methylphenidate, nicotine, opioids, phencyclidine, propofol, and substituted amphetamines, among others.[sources 7]\\r\\nJunD, a transcription factor, and G9a, a histone methyltransferase enzyme, both oppose the function of FosB and inhibit increases in its expression.[74][99][104] Sufficiently overexpressing JunD in the nucleus accumbens with viral vectors can completely block many of the neural and behavioral alterations seen in chronic drug abuse (i.e., the alterations mediated by FosB).[99] FosB also plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to natural rewards, such as palatable food, sex, and exercise.[76][99][105] Since both natural rewards and addictive drugs induce expression of FosB (i.e., they cause the brain to produce more of it), chronic acquisition of these rewards can result in a similar pathological state of addiction.[76][99] Consequently, FosB is the most significant factor involved in both amphetamine addiction and amphetamine-induced sex addictions, which are compulsive sexual behaviors that result from excessive sexual activity and amphetamine use.[76][106][107] These sex addictions are associated with a dopamine dysregulation syndrome which occurs in some patients taking dopaminergic drugs.[76][105]\\r\\nThe effects of amphetamine on gene regulation are both dose- and route-dependent.[100] Most of the research on gene regulation and addiction is based upon animal studies with intravenous amphetamine administration at very high doses.[100] The few studies that have used equivalent (weight-adjusted) human therapeutic doses and oral administration show that these changes, if they occur, are relatively minor.[100] This suggests that medical use of amphetamine does not significantly affect gene regulation.[100]\\r\\nAs of May 2014,[update] there is no effective pharmacotherapy for amphetamine addiction.[108][109][110] Reviews from 2015 and 2016 indicated that TAAR1-selective agonists have significant therapeutic potential as a treatment for psychostimulant addictions;[111][112] however, as of February 2016,[update] the only compounds which are known to function as TAAR1-selective agonists are experimental drugs.[111][112] Amphetamine addiction is largely mediated through increased activation of dopamine receptors and co-localized NMDA receptors[note 6] in the nucleus accumbens;[72] magnesium ions inhibit NMDA receptors by blocking the receptor calcium channel.[72][113] One review suggested that, based upon animal testing, pathological (addiction-inducing) psychostimulant use significantly reduces the level of intracellular magnesium throughout the brain.[72] Supplemental magnesium[note 7] treatment has been shown to reduce amphetamine self-administration (i.e., doses given to oneself) in humans, but it is not an effective monotherapy for amphetamine addiction.[72]\\r\\nCognitive behavioral therapy is currently the most effective clinical treatment for psychostimulant addictions.[80] Additionally, research on the neurobiological effects of physical exercise suggests that daily aerobic exercise, especially endurance exercise (e.g., marathon running), prevents the development of drug addiction and is an effective adjunct therapy (i.e., a supplemental treatment) for amphetamine addiction.[sources 5] Exercise leads to better treatment outcomes when used as an adjunct treatment, particularly for psychostimulant addictions.[77][79][114] In particular, aerobic exercise decreases psychostimulant self-administration, reduces the reinstatement (i.e., relapse) of drug-seeking, and induces increased dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) density in the striatum.[76][114] This is the opposite of pathological stimulant use, which induces decreased striatal DRD2 density.[76] One review noted that exercise may also prevent the development of a drug addiction by altering FosB or c-Fos immunoreactivity in the striatum or other parts of the reward system.[78]\\r\\nAccording to another Cochrane Collaboration review on withdrawal in individuals who compulsively use amphetamine and methamphetamine, \\"when chronic heavy users abruptly discontinue amphetamine use, many report a time-limited withdrawal syndrome that occurs within 24?hours of their last dose.\\"[115] This review noted that withdrawal symptoms in chronic, high-dose users are frequent, occurring in roughly 88% of cases, and persist for 3ÿ4?weeks with a marked \\"crash\\" phase occurring during the first week.[115] Amphetamine withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, drug craving, depressed mood, fatigue, increased appetite, increased movement or decreased movement, lack of motivation, sleeplessness or sleepiness, and lucid dreams.[115] The review indicated that the severity of withdrawal symptoms is positively correlated with the age of the individual and the extent of their dependence.[115] Mild withdrawal symptoms from the discontinuation of amphetamine treatment at therapeutic doses can be avoided by tapering the dose.[1]\\r\\nIn rodents and primates, sufficiently high doses of amphetamine cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, or damage to dopamine neurons, which is characterized by dopamine terminal degeneration and reduced transporter and receptor function.[116][117] There is no evidence that amphetamine is directly neurotoxic in humans.[118][119] However, large doses of amphetamine may indirectly cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity as a result of hyperpyrexia, the excessive formation of reactive oxygen species, and increased autoxidation of dopamine.[sources 8] Animal models of neurotoxicity from high-dose amphetamine exposure indicate that the occurrence of hyperpyrexia (i.e., core body temperature??40?C) is necessary for the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.[117] Prolonged elevations of brain temperature above 40?C likely promote the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity in laboratory animals by facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species, disrupting cellular protein function, and transiently increasing bloodÿbrain barrier permeability.[117]\\r\\nA severe amphetamine overdose can result in a stimulant psychosis that may involve a variety of symptoms, such as delusions and paranoia.[65] A Cochrane Collaboration review on treatment for amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and methamphetamine psychosis states that about 5ÿ15% of users fail to recover completely.[65][122] According to the same review, there is at least one trial that shows antipsychotic medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.[65] Psychosis very rarely arises from therapeutic use.[66][52]\\r\\nLisdexamfetamine is an inactive prodrug that is converted in the body to dextroamphetamine, a pharmacologically active compound which is responsible for the drugs activity.[131] After oral ingestion, lisdexamfetamine is broken down by enzymes in red blood cells to form L-lysine, a naturally occurring essential amino acid, and dextroamphetamine.[6] The conversion of lisdexamfetamine to dextroamphetamine is not affected by gastrointestinal pH and is unlikely to be affected by alterations in normal gastrointestinal transit times.[6][132]\\r\\nThe optical isomers of amphetamine, i.e., dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine, are TAAR1 agonists and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitors that can enter monoamine neurons;[124][125] this allows them to release monoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, among others) from their storage sites in the presynaptic neuron, as well as prevent the reuptake of these neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft.[124][125]\\r\\nLisdexamfetamine was developed with the goal of providing a long duration of effect that is consistent throughout the day, with reduced potential for abuse. The attachment of the amino acid lysine slows down the relative amount of dextroamphetamine available to the blood stream. Because no free dextroamphetamine is present in lisdexamfetamine capsules, dextroamphetamine does not become available through mechanical manipulation, such as crushing or simple extraction. A relatively sophisticated biochemical process is needed to produce dextroamphetamine from lisdexamfetamine.[132] As opposed to Adderall, which contains roughly equal parts of racemic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine salts, lisdexamfetamine is a single-enantiomer dextroamphetamine formula.[131][133] Studies conducted show that lisdexamfetamine dimesylate may have less abuse potential than dextroamphetamine and an abuse profile similar to diethylpropion at dosages that are FDA-approved for treatment of ADHD, but still has a high abuse potential when this dosage is exceeded by over 100%.[132]\\r\\nThe oral bioavailability of amphetamine varies with gastrointestinal pH;[123] it is well absorbed from the gut, and bioavailability is typically over?75% for dextroamphetamine.[134] Amphetamine is a weak base with a pKa of 9.9;[135] consequently, when the pH is basic, more of the drug is in its lipid soluble free base form, and more is absorbed through the lipid-rich cell membranes of the gut epithelium.[135][123] Conversely, an acidic pH means the drug is predominantly in a water-soluble cationic (salt) form, and less is absorbed.[135] Approximately 15ÿ40% of amphetamine circulating in the bloodstream is bound to plasma proteins.[136] Following absorption, amphetamine readily distributes into most tissues in the body, with high concentrations occurring in cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue.[137]\\r\\nThe half-life of amphetamine enantiomers differ and vary with urine pH.[135] At normal urine pH, the half-lives of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine are 9ÿ11?hours and 11ÿ14?hours, respectively.[135] Highly acidic urine will reduce the enantiomer half-lives to 7?hours;[137] highly alkaline urine will increase the half-lives up to 34?hours.[137] The immediate-release and extended release variants of salts of both isomers reach peak plasma concentrations at 3?hours and 7?hours post-dose respectively.[135] Amphetamine is eliminated via the kidneys, with 30ÿ40% of the drug being excreted unchanged at normal urinary pH.[135] When the urinary pH is basic, amphetamine is in its free base form, so less is excreted.[135] When urine pH is abnormal, the urinary recovery of amphetamine may range from a low of 1% to a high of 75%, depending mostly upon whether urine is too basic or acidic, respectively.[135] Following oral administration, amphetamine appears in urine within 3?hours.[137] Roughly 90% of ingested amphetamine is eliminated 3?days after the last oral dose.[137]?\\r\\nThe prodrug lisdexamfetamine is not as sensitive to pH as amphetamine when being absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract;[6] following absorption into the blood stream, it is converted by red blood cell-associated enzymes to dextroamphetamine via hydrolysis.[6] The elimination half-life of lisdexamfetamine is generally less than 1?hour.[6]\\r\\nCYP2D6, dopamine -hydroxylase (DBH), flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), butyrate-CoA ligase (XM-ligase), and glycine N-acyltransferase (GLYAT) are the enzymes known to metabolize amphetamine or its metabolites in humans.[sources 9] Amphetamine has a variety of excreted metabolic products, including 4-hydroxyamphetamine, 4-hydroxynorephedrine, 4-hydroxyphenylacetone, benzoic acid, hippuric acid, norephedrine, and phenylacetone.[135][138] Among these metabolites, the active sympathomimetics are 4-hydroxyamphetamine,[139] 4-hydroxynorephedrine,[140] and norephedrine.[141] The main metabolic pathways involve aromatic para-hydroxylation, aliphatic alpha- and beta-hydroxylation, N-oxidation, N-dealkylation, and deamination.[135][142] The known metabolic pathways, detectable metabolites, and metabolizing enzymes in humans include the following:\\r\\nLisdexamfetamine dimesylate is a water-soluble (792?mg/mL) powder with a white to off-white color.[6]\\r\\nLisdexamfetamine dimesylate is one marketed formulation delivering dextroamphetamine. The following table compares the drug to other amphetamine pharmaceuticals.\\r\\nLisdexamfetamine was developed by New River Pharmaceuticals, who were bought by Shire Pharmaceuticals shortly before lisdexamfetamine began being marketed. It was developed for the intention of creating a longer-lasting and less-easily abused version of dextroamphetamine, as the requirement of conversion into dextroamphetamine via enzymes in the red blood cells increases its onset of action, regardless of the route of ingestion.[158]\\r\\nOn 23 April 2008, Vyvanse received FDA approval for the adult population.[159] On 19 February 2009, Health Canada approved 30?mg and 50?mg capsules of lisdexamfetamine for treatment of ADHD.[160]\\r\\nIn January 2015, lisdexamfetamine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of binge eating disorder in adults.[161]\\r\\nAs of July 2014 lisdexamfetamine was sold the under the following brands: Elvanse, Samexid, Tyvense, Venvanse, and Vyvanse.[162]\\r\\nSome clinical trials that used lisdexamfetamine as an add-on therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) for treatment-resistant depression indicated that this is no more effective than the use of an SSRI or SNRI alone.[163] Other studies indicated that psychostimulants potentiated antidepressants, and were under-prescribed for treatment resistant depression. In those studies patients showed significant improvement in energy, mood, and psychomotor activity.[164] In February 2014, Shire announced that two late-stage clinical trials had shown that Vyvanse was not an effective treatment for depression.[165]","input":"What kind of drug is vyvanse classified as?"},{"output":"on 13 August 1964","context":"Capital punishment in the United Kingdom was used from ancient times until the second half of the 20th century. The last executions in the United Kingdom were by hanging, and took place in 1964, prior to capital punishment being abolished for murder (in 1965 in Great Britain and in 1973 in Northern Ireland). Although unused, the death penalty remained a legally defined punishment for certain offences such as treason until it was completely abolished in 1998. In 2004 the 13th Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights became binding on the United Kingdom, prohibiting the restoration of the death penalty for as long as the UK is a party to the Convention.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Samuel Romilly, speaking to the House of Commons on capital punishment in 1810, declared that \\"[there is] no country on the face of the earth in which there [have] been so many different offences according to law to be punished with death as in England\\".[2] Known as the \\"Bloody Code\\", at its height the criminal law included some 220 crimes punishable by death, including \\"being in the company of Gypsies for one month\\", \\"strong evidence of malice in a child aged 7ÿ14 years of age\\" and \\"blacking the face or using a disguise whilst committing a crime\\". Many of these offences had been introduced to protect the property of the wealthy classes that emerged during the first half of the 18th century, a notable example being the Black Act of 1723, which created 50?capital offences for various acts of theft and poaching.[citation needed] Crimes eligible for the death penalty included shoplifting and stealing sheep, cattle, and horses, and before abolition of the death penalty for theft in 1832, \\"English law was notorious for prescribing the death penalty for a vast range of offenses as slight as the theft of goods valued at twelve pence.\\"[3]\\r\\nWhilst executions for murder, burglary and robbery were common, the death sentences for minor offenders were often not carried out. A sentence of death could be commuted or respited (permanently postponed) for reasons such as benefit of clergy, official pardons, pregnancy of the offender or performance of military or naval duty.[4] Between 1770 and 1830, an estimated 35,000 death sentences were handed down in England and Wales, of which 7,000 executions were carried out.[5]\\r\\nIn 1808 Romilly had the death penalty removed for pickpockets and lesser offenders, starting a process of reform that continued over the next 50 years. The death penalty was mandatory (although it was frequently commuted by the government) until the Judgement of Death Act 1823 gave judges the power to commute the death penalty except for treason and murder. The Punishment of Death, etc. Act 1832 reduced the number of capital crimes by two-thirds. In 1832, the death penalty was abolished for theft, counterfeiting, and forgery except for the forgery of wills and certain powers of attorney.[3][6] Gibbeting was abolished in 1832 and hanging in chains was abolished in 1834. In 1837, the death penalty for forging wills and powers of attorney was abolished. The death penalty for rape was abolished in 1841.[7] In 1861, several acts of Parliament (24 & 25 Vict; c. 94 to c. 100) further reduced the number of civilian capital crimes to five: murder, treason, espionage, arson in royal dockyards, and piracy with violence; there were other offences under military law. The death penalty remained mandatory for treason and murder unless commuted by the monarch.\\r\\nThe Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1864ÿ66[8] concluded (with dissenting Commissioners) that there was not a case for abolition but recommended an end to public executions. This proposal was included in the Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868. From that date executions in Great Britain were carried out only in prisons. The punishment of beheading and quartering those executed for treason was abolished in 1870.[9] The last application of that punishment had been in 1820 and the last sentence to the punishment had been in 1839.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1908, the Children Act 1908 banned the execution of juveniles under the age of 16. In 1922 a new offence of Infanticide was introduced to replace the charge of murder for mothers killing their children in the first year of life. In 1930 a parliamentary Select Committee recommended that capital punishment be suspended for a trial period of five years, but no action was taken. From 1931 pregnant women could no longer be hanged (following the birth of their child) although in practice since the 18th century their sentences had always been commuted.\\r\\nIn 1933 the minimum age for capital punishment was raised to 18 under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. The last known execution by the civilian courts of a person under 18 was that of Charles Dobel, 17, hanged at Maidstone together with his accomplice William Gower, 18, in January 1889. Harold Wilkins, at 16 years old, was the last juvenile sentenced to the death penalty in the United Kingdom, in 1932 for a sexually related murder, but he was reprieved due to age.[10]\\r\\nIn 1938 the issue of the abolition of capital punishment was brought before parliament. A clause within the Criminal Justice Bill called for an experimental five-year suspension of the death penalty. When war broke out in 1939 the bill was postponed. It was revived after the war and to everyone's surprise was adopted by a majority in the House of Commons (245 to 222). In the House of Lords the abolition clause was defeated but the remainder of the bill was passed. Popular support for abolition was absent and the government decided that it would be inappropriate for it to assert its supremacy by invoking the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 over such an unpopular issue.\\r\\nInstead, then Home Secretary, James Chuter Ede, set up a new Royal Commission (the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, 1949ÿ1953) with instructions to determine \\"whether the liability to suffer capital punishment should be limited or modified\\". The Commission's report discussed a number of alternatives to execution by hanging (including the electric chair, gas inhalation, lethal injection, shooting, and the guillotine), but rejected them. It had more difficulty with the principle of capital punishment. Popular opinion believed that the death penalty acted as a deterrent to criminals, but the statistics within the report were inconclusive. Whilst the report recommended abolition from an ethical standpoint, it made no mention of possible miscarriages of justice. The public had by then expressed great dissatisfaction with the verdict in the case of Timothy Evans, who was tried and hanged in 1950 for murdering his infant daughter. It later transpired in 1953 that John Christie had strangled at least six women in the same house; he also confessed to killing Timothy's wife. If the jury in Evans's trial had known this, Evans may have been acquitted. There were other cases in the same period where doubts arose over convictions and subsequent hangings, such as the notorious case of Derek Bentley.\\r\\nThe commission concluded that unless there was overwhelming public support in favour of abolition, the death penalty should be retained.\\r\\nBetween 1900 and 1949, 621 men and 11 women were executed in England and Wales. Ten German agents were executed during the First World War under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914,[11] and 16 spies were executed during the Second World War under the Treachery Act 1940.[12]\\r\\nBy 1957 a number of controversial cases highlighted the issue of capital punishment again. Campaigners for abolition were partially rewarded with the Homicide Act 1957. The Act brought in a distinction between capital and non-capital murder. Only six categories of murder were now punishable by execution:\\r\\nThe police and the government were of the opinion that the death penalty deterred offenders from carrying firearms and it was for this reason that such offences remained punishable by death.\\r\\nIn 1965 the Labour MP Sydney Silverman, who had committed himself to the cause of abolition for longer than 20 years, introduced a Private Member's Bill to suspend the death penalty for murder. It was passed on a free vote in the House of Commons by 200 votes to 98. The bill was subsequently passed by the House of Lords by 204 votes to 104.[14][15] Silverman was opposed in the General Election 1966 in the Nelson and Colne constituency by Patrick Downey, the uncle of Lesley Anne Downey, a victim in the Moors murders case, who stood on an explicitly pro-hanging platform. Downey polled over 5,000 votes, 13.7%, then the largest vote for a genuinely independent candidate since 1945.[16]\\r\\nThe Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 suspended the death penalty in Great Britain (but not in Northern Ireland) for murder for a period of five years, and substituted a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment; it further provided that if, before the expiry of the five-year suspension, each House of Parliament passed a resolution to make the effect of the Act permanent, then it would become permanent. In 1969 the Home Secretary, James Callaghan, proposed a motion to make the Act permanent, which was carried in the Commons on 16 December 1969,[17] and a similar motion was carried in the Lords on 18 December.[18] The death penalty for murder was abolished in Northern Ireland on 25 July 1973 under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973.\\r\\nFollowing the abolition of the death penalty for murder, the House of Commons held a vote during each subsequent parliament until 1997 to restore the death penalty. This motion was always defeated, but the death penalty remained for other crimes until the dates mentioned below:\\r\\nHowever, no executions were carried out in the United Kingdom for any of these offences after the abolition of the death penalty for murder.\\r\\nNevertheless, there remained a working gallows at HMP Wandsworth, London, until 1994, which was tested every six months until 1992. This gallows is now housed in the Galleries of Justice in Nottingham.[21]\\r\\nEngland and in the United Kingdom: on 13 August 1964, Peter Anthony Allen, at Walton Prison in Liverpool, and Gwynne Owen Evans, at Strangeways Prison in Manchester, were executed for the murder of John Alan West on 7 April that year.[22]\\r\\nScotland: Henry John Burnett, 21, on 15 August 1963 in Craiginches Prison, Aberdeen, for the murder of seaman Thomas Guyan.\\r\\nNorthern Ireland: Robert McGladdery, 26, on 20 December 1961 in Crumlin Road Gaol, Belfast, for the murder of Pearl Gamble.\\r\\nWales: Vivian Teed, 24, in Swansea on 6 May 1958, for the murder of William Williams, sub-postmaster of Fforestfach Post Office.[23]\\r\\nNorthern Ireland and in the United Kingdom: Liam Holden in 1973 in Northern Ireland, for the capital murder of a British soldier during the Troubles. Holden was removed from the death cell in May 1973.[24] In 2012 his conviction was quashed on appeal.[25]\\r\\nEngland: David Chapman, who was sentenced to hang in November 1965 for the murder of a swimming pool nightwatchman in Scarborough. He was released from prison in 1979 and later died in a car accident.\\r\\nScotland: Patrick McCarron in 1964 for shooting his wife. He committed suicide in prison in 1970.\\r\\nWales: Edgar Black, who was reprieved on 6 November 1963. He had shot his wife's lover in Cardiff.\\r\\nThe Criminal Damage Act 1971 abolished the offence of arson in royal dockyards.\\r\\nThe Naval Discipline Act 1957 reduced the scope of capital espionage from \\"all spies for the enemy\\" to spies on naval ships or bases.[26] Later, the Armed Forces Act 1981 abolished the death penalty for espionage.[27] (The Official Secrets Act 1911 had created another offence of espionage which carried a maximum sentence of fourteen years.)\\r\\nBeheading was abolished as a method of execution for treason in 1973.[28] Hanging, however, remained available until 1998 when, under a House of Lords amendment to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, proposed by Lord Archer of Sandwell, the death penalty was abolished for treason and piracy with violence, replacing it with a discretionary maximum sentence of life imprisonment. These were the last civilian offences punishable by death.\\r\\nOn 20 May 1998 the House of Commons voted to ratify the 6th Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights prohibiting capital punishment except \\"in time of war or imminent threat of war\\". The last remaining provisions for the death penalty under military jurisdiction (including in wartime) were removed when section 21(5) of the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force on 9 November 1998. On 10 October 2003, effective from 1 February 2004,[29] the UK acceded to the 13th Protocol, which prohibits the death penalty in all circumstances.[30]\\r\\nAs a legacy from colonial times, several states in the West Indies still had the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as the court of final appeal; although the death penalty has been retained in these states, the Privy Council would sometimes delay or deny executions. Some of these states severed links with the British court system in 2001 by transferring the responsibilities of the Privy Council to the Caribbean Court of Justice, to speed up executions.[31]\\r\\nAlthough not part of the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey are British Crown dependencies.\\r\\nIn the Channel Islands, the last death sentence was passed in 1984; the last execution in the Channel Islands was in Jersey on 9 October 1959, when Francis Joseph Huchet was hanged for murder.[32] The Human Rights (Amendment) (Jersey) Order 2006[33] amends the Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000[34] to give effect to the 13th Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights providing for the total abolition of the death penalty. Both of these laws came into effect on 10 December 2006. Capital punishment was abolished in Guernsey in 2003, and the 13th Protocol was extended to Guernsey in April 2004. Sark formally retained it until January 2004, when the Chief Pleas in a 14ÿ9 vote removed it from the statutes.[35][36]\\r\\nThe last execution on the Isle of Man took place in 1872, when John Kewish was hanged for patricide. Capital punishment was not formally abolished by Tynwald (the island's parliament) until 1993.[37] Five persons were sentenced to death (for murder) on the Isle of Man between 1973 and 1992, although all sentences were commuted to life imprisonment. The last person to be sentenced to death in the UK or its dependencies was Anthony Teare, who was convicted at the Manx Court of General Gaol Delivery in Douglas for contract murder in 1992; he was subsequently retried and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1994.[38] In 2004 the 13th Protocol was adopted,[39] with an effective date of 1 November 2006.[40]\\r\\nLike the Crown dependencies, the British overseas territories are constitutionally not part of the United Kingdom. However, the British government's ultimate responsibility for good governance of the territories has led it over recent years to pursue a policy of revoking all statutory provision for the death penalty in those territories where it had up until recently been legal.\\r\\nThe last executions in an overseas territory, and indeed the last on British soil, took place in Bermuda in 1977, when two men, Larry Tacklyn and Erskine Burrows, were hanged for the 1973 murder of the territory's then Governor Sir Richard Sharples.[41]\\r\\nIn 1991, the British government extended an Order in Council to its Caribbean territories whose effect was to abolish capital punishment for murder: Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat and the Turks and Caicos Islands.[42]\\r\\nThe British government was unable to extend the abolition via Order in Council to Bermuda, the UK's most autonomous overseas territory with powers of almost total self-governancebut warned that if voluntary abolition was not forthcoming it would be forced to consider the unprecedented step of \\"whether to impose abolition by means of an Act of Parliament\\".[43] As a result, the Bermudian government introduced its own domestic legislation in 1999 to rectify the problem.[44]\\r\\nFurther measures were subsequently adopted to revoke technicalities in British overseas territories' domestic legislation as regards use of the death penalty for crimes of treason and piracy. In October 2002 the British government abolished the death penalty for treason and piracy in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Since then, the death penalty has been outlawed under all circumstances in all the UK's overseas territories.[45]\\r\\nSince the death penalty's suspension in 1965, there have been continued public and media calls for its reintroduction, particularly prompted by high-profile murder cases.\\r\\nAt the same time, there have been a number of miscarriages of justice since 1965 where someone convicted of murder has later had their conviction quashed on appeal and been released from prison, strengthening the argument of those who oppose the death penalty's reintroduction. These include the Birmingham Six (cleared in 1991 of planting an IRA bomb which killed 21 people in 1974), the Guildford Four (cleared in 1989 of murdering five people in another 1974 IRA bombing), Stephen Downing (a Derbyshire man who was freed in 2001 after serving 27 years for the murder of a woman in a churchyard) and Barry George (who was freed in 2007 when his conviction for the 1999 murder of TV presenter Jill Dando was quashed on appeal).[46]\\r\\nPerhaps the first high-profile murder case which sparked widespread calls for a return of the death penalty was the Moors murders trial in 1966, the year after the death penalty's suspension, in which Ian Brady and Myra Hindley were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murders of two children and a teenager in the Manchester area (they later confessed to a further two murders).[47] Later in 1966, the murder of three policemen in West London also attracted widespread public support for the death penalty's return.[48] Other subsequent high-profile cases to have sparked widespread media and public calls for the death penalty's return include \\"Yorkshire Ripper\\" Peter Sutcliffe, convicted in 1981 of murdering 13 women and attacking seven others in the north of England,[49] Roy Whiting, who murdered a seven-year-old girl in West Sussex in 2000,[50] and Ian Huntley, a Cambridgeshire school caretaker who killed two 10-year-old girls in 2002.[51]\\r\\nA November 2009 television survey showed that 70% favoured reinstating the death penalty for at least one of the following crimes: armed robbery, rape, crimes related to paedophilia, terrorism, adult murder, child murder, child rape, treason, child abuse or kidnapping. However, respondents only favoured capital punishment for adult murder, the polling question asked by other organisations such as Gallup, by small majorities or pluralities: overall, 51% favoured the death penalty for adult murder, while 56% in Wales did, 55% in Scotland, and only 49% in England.[52]\\r\\nIn August 2011, the Internet blogger Paul Staineswho writes a political blog as Guido Fawkes and heads the Restore Justice Campaignlaunched an e-petition on the Downing Street website calling for the restoration of the death penalty for those convicted of the murder of children and police officers.[53] The petition was one of several in support or opposition of capital punishment to be published by the government with the launch of its e-petitions website. Petitions attracting 100,000 signatures would prompt a parliamentary debate on a particular topic, but not necessarily lead to any Parliamentary Bills being put forward.[54] When the petition closed on 4 February 2012 it had received 26,351 signatures in support of restoring capital punishment,[55] but a counter-petition calling to retain the ban on capital punishment received 33,455 signatures during the same time period.[56]\\r\\nAlso in August 2011, a representative survey conducted by Angus Reid Public Opinion showed that 65% of Britons support reinstating the death penalty for murder in Great Britain, while 28% oppose this course of action. Men and respondents aged over 35 are more likely to endorse the change.[57]\\r\\nIn March 2015 a survey by the NatCen British Social Attitudes Report showed that public support for the death penalty had dropped to 48 per cent.[58]\\r\\nAfter Royal Assent for the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965, supporters in Parliament have made several attempts to reintroduce capital punishment. On 23 November 1966, Duncan Sandys was refused leave to bring in a Bill to restore capital punishment for the murder of police or prison officers, by a vote of 170 to 292.[59] Motions to make the five-year suspension of capital punishment under the 1965 Act permanent were opposed, but agreed by 343 to 185 in the House of Commons;[60] in the House of Lords, an amendment to continue with a temporary suspension of capital punishment until 31 July 1973 was rejected by 174 to 220.[61] In April 1973, the House of Commons voted against reintroduction.[62]\\r\\nThe deaths of civilians in several IRA bombings in 1974 prompted a renewed debate. On 11 December 1974 Brian Walden moved a motion declaring that \\"the death penalty would neither deter terrorists nor increase the safety of the public\\"; Jill Knight moved an amendment calling instead for introduction of legislation providing for death to be the penalty for acts of terrorism causing death. Her amendment was rejected by 217 to 369.[63] A year later, Ivan Lawrence's motion \\"That this House demands capital punishment for terrorist offences causing death\\" was rejected by 232 to 361.[64]\\r\\nAfter the Conservatives' victory in the 1979 general election, Eldon Griffiths (Parliamentary adviser to the Police Federation of England and Wales) moved a motion \\"that the sentence of capital punishment should again be available to the courts\\" on 19 July 1979.[65] While the motion was not expected to pass, the margin of its defeat (243 to 362) was much wider than expected.[66] Later in the same Parliament, the Criminal Justice Bill provided an opportunity on 11 May 1982 for several new clauses to be proposed which would have reinstated capital punishment. The first, which simply declared that \\"A person convicted of murder shall be liable to capital punishment\\", was tabled by Edward Gardner, and rejected by 195 to 357.[67] It was followed by an alternative under which capital punishment would be available \\"as the penalty for an act of terrorism involving the loss of human life\\"; this new clause was rejected by 176 to 332.[68] A further new clause proposing capital punishment \\"as the penalty for murder by means of firearms or explosives\\" was rejected by 176 to 343.[69] Then a new clause allowing for capital punishment \\"as the penalty for murder of a police or prison officer\\" was rejected by 208 to 332.[70] Finally a new clause allowing capital punishment \\"as the penalty for murder in the course of robbery and burglary which involves the use of offensive weapons\\" was rejected by 151 to 331.[71]\\r\\nThe new Parliament in 1983 again prompted supporters of capital punishment to put their case. Sir Edward Gardner's motion \\"That this House favours the restoration of the death penalty for murder\\" was debated on 13 July 1983, with several amendments moved to restrict capital punishment to certain categories of murder. The amendments were voted on first: capital punishment for murder \\"resulting from acts of terrorism\\" was rejected by 245 to 361, for murder \\"of a police officer during the course of his duties\\" by 263 to 344, for murder \\"of a prison officer during the course of his duties\\" by 252 to 348, for murder \\"by shooting or causing an explosion\\" by 204 to 374, and for murder \\"in the course or furtherance of theft\\" by 194 to 369. The main motion was then defeated by 223 to 368.[72] Towards the end of the Parliament, a new clause proposed to the Criminal Justice Bill proposed to return the death penalty for \\"A person convicted by the unanimous verdict of a jury of the premeditated killing of another person or of knowingly and intentionally killing another person in a manner, or for a reason, or in circumstances which a reasonable person would consider to be evil\\" was rejected by 230 to 342 on 1 April 1987.[73]\\r\\nThe Criminal Justice Bill in 1988 provided a further opportunity for a debate; the new clause proposed by Roger Gale allowed for the jury in a murder case to \\"have the power, upon reaching a verdict of guilt of murder, to recommend .. death in the manner authorised by law\\". It was rejected by 218 to 341.[74]\\r\\nThe aforementioned bills were rejected despite support from then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.[75]\\r\\nOn 17 December 1990 a new Criminal Justice Bill again saw amendments designed to reintroduce capital punishment. The first covered anyone over 18 \\"convicted of the murder of a police officer acting in the execution of his duty\\" and was rejected by 215 to 350;[76] a general reintroduction of death as the penalty for murder (with special provision for the Court of Appeal to decide whether to substitute a life sentence) was then rejected by 182 to 367.[77] Capital punishment for \\"murder committed by means of firearms, explosives or an offensive weapon, or for the murder of a police or prison officer\\" was rejected by 186 to 349.[78]\\r\\nThe most recent Parliamentary debate on a question proposing reintroduction of capital punishment came on 21 February 1994 when new clauses to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill were moved. The first, providing for death as the sentence for \\"the murder of a police officer acting in the execution of his duty\\", was rejected by 186 to 383;[79] A new clause providing for general reintroduction with power for the Court of Appeal to substitute life imprisonment was rejected by 159 to 403.[80] This would have been aimed at terrorists in the Northern Ireland conflict.[81]\\r\\nIn June 2013 a new bill for capital punishment in England and Wales was introduced. This Bill has been withdrawn and will not progress any further.[82]\\r\\nThe following parties support the reintroduction of capital punishment:","input":"When was the last person executed in england?"},{"output":"64K (216 = 7004655360000000000?65536) rows and 256 columns (28 as label 'IV')","context":"Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet developed by Microsoft for Windows, macOS, Android and iOS. It features calculation, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming language called Visual Basic for Applications. It has been a very widely applied spreadsheet for these platforms, especially since version 5 in 1993, and it has replaced Lotus 1-2-3 as the industry standard for spreadsheets. Excel forms part of Microsoft Office.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft Excel has the basic features of all spreadsheets,[4] using a grid of cells arranged in numbered rows and letter-named columns to organize data manipulations like arithmetic operations. It has a battery of supplied functions to answer statistical, engineering and financial needs. In addition, it can display data as line graphs, histograms and charts, and with a very limited three-dimensional graphical display. It allows sectioning of data to view its dependencies on various factors for different perspectives (using pivot tables and the scenario manager).[5] It has a programming aspect, Visual Basic for Applications, allowing the user to employ a wide variety of numerical methods, for example, for solving differential equations of mathematical physics,[6][7] and then reporting the results back to the spreadsheet. It also has a variety of interactive features allowing user interfaces that can completely hide the spreadsheet from the user, so the spreadsheet presents itself as a so-called application, or decision support system (DSS), via a custom-designed user interface, for example, a stock analyzer,[8] or in general, as a design tool that asks the user questions and provides answers and reports.[9][10][11] In a more elaborate realization, an Excel application can automatically poll external databases and measuring instruments using an update schedule,[12] analyze the results, make a Word report or PowerPoint slide show, and e-mail these presentations on a regular basis to a list of participants. Excel was not designed to be used as a database.[13]\\r\\nMicrosoft allows for a number of optional command-line switches to control the manner in which Excel starts.[14]\\r\\nThe Windows version of Excel supports programming through Microsoft's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which is a dialect of Visual Basic. Programming with VBA allows spreadsheet manipulation that is awkward or impossible with standard spreadsheet techniques. Programmers may write code directly using the Visual Basic Editor (VBE), which includes a window for writing code, debugging code, and code module organization environment. The user can implement numerical methods as well as automating tasks such as formatting or data organization in VBA[15] and guide the calculation using any desired intermediate results reported back to the spreadsheet.\\r\\nVBA was removed from Mac Excel 2008, as the developers did not believe that a timely release would allow porting the VBA engine natively to Mac OS X. VBA was restored in the next version, Mac Excel 2011,[16] although the build lacks support for ActiveX objects, impacting some high level developer tools.[17]\\r\\nA common and easy way to generate VBA code is by using the Macro Recorder.[18] The Macro Recorder records actions of the user and generates VBA code in the form of a macro. These actions can then be repeated automatically by running the macro. The macros can also be linked to different trigger types like keyboard shortcuts,[19] a command button or a graphic. The actions in the macro can be executed from these trigger types or from the generic toolbar options. The VBA code of the macro can also be edited in the VBE. Certain features such as loop functions and screen prompt by their own properties, and some graphical display items, cannot be recorded but must be entered into the VBA module directly by the programmer. Advanced users can employ user prompts to create an interactive program, or react to events such as sheets being loaded or changed.\\r\\nMacro Recorded code may not be compatible with Excel versions. Some code that is used in Excel 2010 cannot be used in Excel 2003. Making a Macro that changes the cell colours and making changes to other aspects of cells may not be backward compatible.\\r\\nVBA code interacts with the spreadsheet through the Excel Object Model,[20] a vocabulary identifying spreadsheet objects, and a set of supplied functions or methods that enable reading and writing to the spreadsheet and interaction with its users (for example, through custom toolbars or command bars and message boxes). User-created VBA subroutines execute these actions and operate like macros generated using the macro recorder, but are more flexible and efficient.\\r\\nFrom its first version Excel supported end user programming of macros (automation of repetitive tasks) and user defined functions (extension of Excel's built-in function library). In early versions of Excel these programs were written in a macro language whose statements had formula syntax and resided in the cells of special purpose macro sheets (stored with file extension .XLM in Windows.) XLM was the default macro language for Excel through Excel 4.0.[21] Beginning with version 5.0 Excel recorded macros in VBA by default but with version 5.0 XLM recording was still allowed as an option. After version 5.0 that option was discontinued. All versions of Excel, including Excel 2010 are capable of running an XLM macro, though Microsoft discourages their use.[22]\\r\\nExcel supports charts, graphs, or histograms generated from specified groups of cells. The generated graphic component can either be embedded within the current sheet, or added as a separate object.\\r\\nThese displays are dynamically updated if the content of cells change. For example, suppose that the important design requirements are displayed visually; then, in response to a user's change in trial values for parameters, the curves describing the design change shape, and their points of intersection shift, assisting the selection of the best design.\\r\\nVersions of Excel up to 7.0 had a limitation in the size of their data sets of 16K (214 = 7004163840000000000?16384) rows. Versions 8.0 through 11.0 could handle 64K (216 = 7004655360000000000?65536) rows and 256 columns (28 as label 'IV'). Version 12.0 can handle 1M (220 = 7006104857600000000?1048576) rows, and 7004163840000000000?16384 (214 as label 'XFD') columns.[23]\\r\\nMicrosoft Excel up until 2007 version used a proprietary binary file format called Excel Binary File Format (.XLS) as its primary format.[25] Excel 2007 uses Office Open XML as its primary file format, an XML-based format that followed after a previous XML-based format called \\"XML Spreadsheet\\" (\\"XMLSS\\"), first introduced in Excel 2002.[26]\\r\\nAlthough supporting and encouraging the use of new XML-based formats as replacements, Excel 2007 remained backwards-compatible with the traditional, binary formats. In addition, most versions of Microsoft Excel can read CSV, DBF, SYLK, DIF, and other legacy formats. Support for some older file formats was removed in Excel 2007.[27] The file formats were mainly from DOS-based programs.\\r\\nOpenOffice.org has created documentation of the Excel format.[28] Since then Microsoft made the Excel binary format specification available to freely download.[29]\\r\\nThe XML Spreadsheet format introduced in Excel 2002[26] is a simple, XML based format missing some more advanced features like storage of VBA macros. Though the intended file extension for this format is .xml, the program also correctly handles XML files with .xls extension. This feature is widely used by third-party applications (e.g. MySQL Query Browser) to offer \\"export to Excel\\" capabilities without implementing binary file format. The following example will be correctly opened by Excel if saved either as Book1.xml or Book1.xls:\\r\\nMicrosoft Excel 2007, along with the other products in the Microsoft Office 2007 suite, introduced new file formats. The first of these (.xlsx) is defined in the Office Open XML (OOXML) specification.\\r\\nWindows applications such as Microsoft Access and Microsoft Word, as well as Excel can communicate with each other and use each other's capabilities. The most common are Dynamic Data Exchange: although strongly deprecated by Microsoft, this is a common method to send data between applications running on Windows, with official MS publications referring to it as \\"the protocol from hell\\".[30] As the name suggests, it allows applications to supply data to others for calculation and display. It is very common in financial markets, being used to connect to important financial data services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.\\r\\nOLE Object Linking and Embedding: allows a Windows application to control another to enable it to format or calculate data. This may take on the form of \\"embedding\\" where an application uses another to handle a task that it is more suited to, for example a PowerPoint presentation may be embedded in an Excel spreadsheet or vice versa.[31][32][33][34]\\r\\nExcel users can access external data sources via Microsoft Office features such as (for example) .odc connections built with the Office Data Connection file format. Excel files themselves may be updated using a Microsoft supplied ODBC driver.\\r\\nExcel can accept data in real time through several programming interfaces, which allow it to communicate with many data sources such as Bloomberg and Reuters (through addins such as Power Plus Pro).\\r\\nAlternatively, Microsoft Query provides ODBC-based browsing within Microsoft Excel.[38][39][40]\\r\\nProgrammers have produced APIs to open Excel spreadsheets in a variety of applications and environments other than Microsoft Excel. These include opening Excel documents on the web using either ActiveX controls, or plugins like the Adobe Flash Player. The Apache POI opensource project provides Java libraries for reading and writing Excel spreadsheet files. ExcelPackage is another open-source project that provides server-side generation of Microsoft Excel 2007 spreadsheets. PHPExcel is a PHP library that converts Excel5, Excel 2003, and Excel 2007 formats into objects for reading and writing within a web application. Excel Services is a current .NET developer tool that can enhance Excel's capabilities. Excel spreadsheets can be accessed from Python with xlrd and openpyxl. js-xlsx and js-xls can open Excel spreadsheets from JS.\\r\\nMicrosoft Excel protection offers several types of passwords:\\r\\nAll passwords except password to open a document can be removed instantly regardless of Microsoft Excel version used to create the document. These types of passwords are used primarily for shared work on a document. Such password-protected documents are not encrypted, and a data sources from a set password is saved in a documents header. Password to protect workbook is an exception ÿ when it is set, a document is encrypted with the standard password VelvetSweatshop, but since it is known to public, it actually does not add any extra protection to the document. The only type of password that can prevent a trespasser from gaining access to a document is password to open a document. The cryptographic strength of this kind of protection depends strongly on the Microsoft Excel version that was used to create the document.\\r\\nIn Microsoft Excel 95 and earlier versions, password to open is converted to a 16-bit key that can be instantly cracked. In Excel 97/2000 the password is converted to a 40-bit key, which can also be cracked very quickly using modern equipment. As regards services which use rainbow tables (e.g. Password-Find), it takes up to several seconds to remove protection. In addition, password-cracking programs can brute-force attack passwords at a rate of hundreds of thousands of passwords a second, which not only lets them decrypt a document, but also find the original password.\\r\\nIn Excel 2003/XP the encryption is slightly better ÿ a user can choose any encryption algorithm that is available in the system (see Cryptographic Service Provider). Due to the CSP, an Excel file can't be decrypted, and thus the password to open can't be removed, though the brute-force attack speed remains quite high. Nevertheless, the older Excel 97/2000 algorithm is set by the default.[44] Therefore, users who did not changed the default settings lack reliable protection of their documents.\\r\\nThe situation changed fundamentally in Excel 2007, where the modern AES algorithm with a key of 128 bits started being used for decryption, and a 50,000-fold use of the hash function SHA1 reduced the speed of brute-force attacks down to hundreds of passwords per second. In Excel 2010, the strength of the protection by the default was increased two times due to the use of a 100,000-fold SHA1 to convert a password to a key.\\r\\nMicrosoft Excel Viewer is a freeware program for viewing and printing spreadsheet documents created by Excel.[45] Excel Viewer is similar to Microsoft Word Viewer in functionality. (There is not a current version for the Mac.) Excel Viewer is available for Microsoft Windows and Windows CE handheld PCs, such as the NEC MobilePro.[46] It is also possible to open Excel files using certain online tools and services.[citation needed]Online excel viewers do not require users to have Microsoft Excel installed.[45]\\r\\nOther errors specific to Excel include misleading statistics functions, mod function errors, date limitations and the Excel 2007 error.[47]\\r\\nThe accuracy and convenience of statistical tools in Excel has been criticized,[48][49][50][51][52] as mishandling missing data, as returning incorrect values due to inept handling of round-off and large numbers, as only selectively updating calculations on a spreadsheet when some cell values are changed, and as having a limited set of statistical tools. Microsoft has announced some of these issues are addressed in Excel 2010.[53]\\r\\nExcel has issues with modulo operations. In the case of excessively large results, Excel will return the error warning #NUM! instead of an answer.[54][55]\\r\\nExcel includes February 29, 1900, incorrectly treating 1900 as a leap year, even though e.g. 2100 is correctly treated as a regular year.[56][57] The bug originated from Lotus 1-2-3 (deliberately implemented to save computer memory), and was also purposely implemented in Excel, for the purpose of bug compatibility.[58] This legacy has later been carried over into Office Open XML file format.[59]\\r\\nThus a (not necessarily whole) number greater than or equal to 61 interpreted as a date and time is the (real) number of days after December 30, 1899, 0:00, a non-negative number less than 60 is the number of days after December 31, 1899, 0:00, and numbers with whole part 60 represent the fictional day.\\r\\nExcel supports dates with years in the range 1900-9999, except that December 31, 1899 can be entered as 0 and is displayed as 0-jan-1900.\\r\\nConverting a fraction of a day into hours, minutes and days by treating it as a moment on the day January 1, 1900, does not work for a negative fraction.[60]\\r\\nEntering text that happens to be in a form that is interpreted as a date, the text can be unintentionally changed to a standard date format. A similar problem occurs when a text happens to be in the form of a floating point notation of a number. In these cases the original exact text cannot be recovered from the result. In the case of entering gene names this is a well known problem in the analysis of DNA, for example in bioinformatics. The problem was first described in 2004.[61][62]\\r\\nMicrosoft Excel will not open two documents with the same name and instead will display the following error:\\r\\nThe reason is for calculation ambiguity with linked cells. If there is a cell ='[Book1.xlsx]Sheet1'!$G$33, and there are two books named \\"Book1\\" open, there is no way to tell which one the user means.[64]\\r\\nDespite the use of 15-figure precision, Excel can display many more figures (up to thirty) upon user request. But the displayed figures are not those actually used in its computations, and so, for example, the difference of two numbers may differ from the difference of their displayed values. Although such departures are usually beyond the 15th decimal, exceptions do occur, especially for very large or very small numbers. Serious errors can occur if decisions are made based upon automated comparisons of numbers (for example, using the Excel If function), as equality of two numbers can be unpredictable.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the figure the fraction 1/9000 is displayed in Excel. Although this number has a decimal representation that is an infinite string of ones, Excel displays only the leading 15 figures. In the second line, the number one is added to the fraction, and again Excel displays only 15 figures. In the third line, one is subtracted from the sum using Excel. Because the sum in the second line has only eleven 1's after the decimal, the difference when 1 is subtracted from this displayed value is three 0's followed by a string of eleven 1's. However, the difference reported by Excel in the third line is three 0's followed by a string of thirteen 1's and two extra erroneous digits. This is because Excel calculates with about half a digit more than it displays.\\r\\nExcel works with a modified 1985 version of the IEEE 754 specification.[65] Excel's implementation involves conversions between binary and decimal representations, leading to accuracy that is on average better than one would expect from simple fifteen digit precision, but that can be worse. See the main article for details.\\r\\nBesides accuracy in user computations, the question of accuracy in Excel-provided functions may be raised. Particularly in the arena of statistical functions, Excel has been criticized for sacrificing accuracy for speed of calculation.[66][67]\\r\\nAs many calculations in Excel are executed using VBA, an additional issue is the accuracy of VBA, which varies with variable type and user-requested precision.[68]\\r\\nIn 2004 scientists reported automatic (and inadvertent) conversion of gene nomenclature into dates.[61] A follow-up study in 2016 found many peer reviewed scientific journal papers had been affected and that \\"Of the selected journals, the proportion of published articles with Excel files containing gene lists that are affected by gene name errors is 19.6?%.[62] Excel parses the copied and pasted data and sometimes changes them depending on what it thinks they are. For example, MARCH1 (Membrane Associated Ring-CH-type finger 1) gets converted to the date March 1 (1-Mar) and SEPT2 (Septin 2) is converted into September 2 (2-Sep) etc.[69] While some secondary news sources[70] reported this as a fault with Excel, the original authors of the 2016 paper placed the blame with the researchers mis-using Excel.[62][71]\\r\\nMicrosoft originally marketed a spreadsheet program called Multiplan in 1982. Multiplan became very popular on CP/M systems, but on MS-DOS systems it lost popularity to Lotus 1-2-3. Microsoft released the first version of Excel for the Macintosh on September 30, 1985, and the first Windows version was 2.05 (to synchronize with the Macintosh version 2.2) in November 1987.[72] Lotus was slow to bring 1-2-3 to Windows and by the early 1990s Excel had started to outsell 1-2-3 and helped Microsoft achieve its position as a leading PC software developer. This accomplishment solidified Microsoft as a valid competitor and showed its future of developing GUI software. Microsoft maintained its advantage with regular new releases, every two years or so.\\r\\nExcel 2.0 is the first version of Excel for the Intel platform. Versions prior to 2.0 were only available on the Apple Macintosh.\\r\\nThe first Windows version was labeled \\"2\\" to correspond to the Mac version. This included a run-time version of Windows.[73]\\r\\nBYTE in 1989 listed Excel for Windows as among the \\"Distinction\\" winners of the BYTE Awards. The magazine stated that the port of the \\"extraordinary\\" Macintosh version \\"shines\\", with a user interface as good as or better than the original.[74]\\r\\nIncluded toolbars, drawing capabilities, outlining, add-in support, 3D charts, and many more new features.[73]\\r\\nIntroduced auto-fill.[75]\\r\\nAlso, an easter egg in Excel 4.0 reveals a hidden animation of a dancing set of numbers 1 through 3, representing Lotus 1-2-3, which was then crushed by an Excel logo.[76]\\r\\nWith version 5.0, Excel has included Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), a programming language based on Visual Basic which adds the ability to automate tasks in Excel and to provide user-defined functions (UDF) for use in worksheets. VBA is a powerful addition to the application and includes a fully featured integrated development environment (IDE). Macro recording can produce VBA code replicating user actions, thus allowing simple automation of regular tasks. VBA allows the creation of forms and in?worksheet controls to communicate with the user. The language supports use (but not creation) of ActiveX (COM) DLL's; later versions add support for class modules allowing the use of basic object-oriented programming techniques.\\r\\nThe automation functionality provided by VBA made Excel a target for macro viruses. This caused serious problems until antivirus products began to detect these viruses. Microsoft belatedly took steps to prevent the misuse by adding the ability to disable macros completely, to enable macros when opening a workbook or to trust all macros signed using a trusted certificate.\\r\\nVersions 5.0 to 9.0 of Excel contain various Easter eggs, including a \\"Hall of Tortured Souls\\", although since version?10 Microsoft has taken measures to eliminate such undocumented features from their products.[77]\\r\\n5.0 was released in a 16-bit x86 version for Windows 3.1 and later in a 32-bit version for NT 3.51 (x86/Alpha/PowerPC)\\r\\nReleased in 1995 with Microsoft Office for Windows 95, this is the first major version after Excel 5.0, as there is no Excel 6.0 with all of the Office applications standardizing on the same major version number.\\r\\nInternal rewrite to 32-bits. Almost no external changes, but faster and more stable.\\r\\nIncluded in Office 97 (for x86 and Alpha). This was a major upgrade that introduced the paper clip office assistant and featured standard VBA used instead of internal Excel Basic. It introduced the now-removed Natural Language labels.\\r\\nThis version of Excel includes a flight simulator as an Easter Egg.\\r\\nIncluded in Office 2000. This was a minor upgrade, but introduced an upgrade to the clipboard where it can hold multiple objects at once. The Office Assistant, whose frequent unsolicited appearance in Excel 97 had annoyed many users, became less intrusive.\\r\\nIncluded in Office XP. Very minor enhancements.\\r\\nIncluded in Office 2003. Minor enhancements, most significant being the new Tables.\\r\\nIncluded in Office 2007. This release was a major upgrade from the previous version. Similar to other updated Office products, Excel in 2007 used the new Ribbon menu system. This was different from what users were used to, and was met with mixed reactions. One study reported fairly good acceptance by users except highly experienced users and users of word processing applications with a classical WIMP interface, but was less convinced in terms of efficiency and organisation.[78] However, an online survey reported that a majority of respondents had a negative opinion of the change, with advanced users being \\"somewhat more negative\\" than intermediate users, and users reporting a self-estimated reduction in productivity.[79]\\r\\nAdded functionality included the SmartArt set of editable business diagrams. Also added was an improved management of named variables through the Name Manager, and much improved flexibility in formatting graphs, which allow (x, y) coordinate labeling and lines of arbitrary weight. Several improvements to pivot tables were introduced.\\r\\nAlso like other office products, the Office Open XML file formats were introduced, including .xlsm for a workbook with macros and .xlsx for a workbook without macros.[80]\\r\\nSpecifically, many of the size limitations of previous versions were greatly increased. To illustrate, the number of rows was now 1,048,576 (220) and columns was 16,384 (214; the far-right column is XFD). This changes what is a valid A1?reference versus a named range. This version made more extensive use of multiple cores for the calculation of spreadsheets; however, VBA macros are not handled in parallel and XLL add?ins were only executed in parallel if they were thread-safe and this was indicated at registration.\\r\\nIncluded in Office 2010, this is the next major version after v12.0, as version number 13 was skipped.\\r\\nMinor enhancements and 64-bit support,[81] including the following:\\r\\nIncluded in Office 2013, along with a lot of new tools included in this release:\\r\\nIncluded in Office 2016, along with a lot of new tools included in this release:\\r\\nExcel offers many user interface tweaks over the earliest electronic spreadsheets; however, the essence remains the same as in the original spreadsheet software, VisiCalc: the program displays cells organized in rows and columns, and each cell may contain data or a formula, with relative or absolute references to other cells.\\r\\nExcel 2.0 for Windows, which was modeled after its Mac GUI-based counterpart, indirectly expanded the installed base of the then-nascent Windows environment. Excel 2.0 was released a month before Windows 2.0, and the installed base of Windows was so low at that point in 1987 that Microsoft had to bundle a runtime version of Windows 1.0 with Excel 2.0.[92] Unlike Microsoft Word, there never was a DOS version of Excel.\\r\\nExcel became the first spreadsheet to allow the user to define the appearance of spreadsheets (fonts, character attributes and cell appearance). It also introduced intelligent cell recomputation, where only cells dependent on the cell being modified are updated (previous spreadsheet programs recomputed everything all the time or waited for a specific user command). Excel introduced auto-fill, the ability to drag and expand the selection box to automatically copy cell or row contents to adjacent cells or rows, adjusting the copies intelligently by automatically incrementing cell references or contents. Excel also introduced extensive graphing capabilities.\\r\\nBecause Excel is widely used, it has been attacked by hackers. While Excel is not directly exposed to the Internet, if an attacker can get a victim to open a file in Excel, and there is an appropriate security bug in Excel, then the attacker can get control of the victim's computer.[93] UK's GCHQ has a tool named TORNADO ALLEY with this purpose.[94][95]","input":"How many rows and columns in excel 2005?"},{"output":"Hatshepsut","context":"Hatshepsut (/h?t???ps?t/;[4] also Hatchepsut; Egyptian: ?3.t-?ps.wt \\"Foremost of Noble Ladies\\";[5] 1507ÿ1458?BC) was the fifth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. She was the second historically confirmed female pharaoh, the first being Sobekneferu.[6] (Various other women may have also ruled as pharaohs regnant or at least regents before Hatshepsut, as early as Neithhotep around 1,600 years prior.) Hatshepsut came to the throne of Egypt in 1478 BC. Officially, she ruled jointly with Thutmose III, who had ascended to the throne the previous year as a child of about two years old. Hatshepsut was the chief wife of Thutmose II, Thutmose IIIs father. She is generally regarded by Egyptologists as one of the most successful pharaohs, reigning longer than any other woman of an indigenous Egyptian dynasty. According to Egyptologist James Henry Breasted she is also known as \\"the first great woman in history of whom we are informed.\\"[7]\\r\\nHatshepsut was the daughter and only child of Thutmose I and his primary wife Ahmose.[8] Her husband Thutmose II was the son of Thutmose I and a secondary wife named Mutnofret, who carried the title King's daughter and was probably a child of Ahmose I. Hatshepsut and Thutmose II had a daughter named Neferure. After having their daughter, Hatshepsut could not birth anymore children. Unable to have a son,[9] Thutmose II fathered Thutmose III with Iset, a secondary wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough contemporary records of her reign are documented in diverse ancient sources, Hatshepsut was thought by early modern scholars as only having served as a co-regent from approximately 1479 to 1458 BC, during years seven to twenty-one of the reign previously identified as that of Thutmose III.[10] Today Egyptologists generally agree that Hatshepsut assumed the position of pharaoh.[11][12]\\r\\nHatshepsut was described as having a reign of about 21 years by ancient authors. Josephus and Julius Africanus both quote Manetho's king list, mentioning a woman called Amessis or Amensis who has been identified (from the context) as Hatshepsut. In Josephus' work, her reign is described as lasting 21 years and nine months,[13] while Africanus stated it was twenty-two years. At this point in the histories, records of the reign of Hatshepsut end, since the first major foreign campaign of Thutmose III was dated to his 22nd year, which also would have been Hatshepsut's 22nd year as pharaoh.[14]\\r\\nDating the beginning of her reign is more difficult, however. Her father's reign began in either 1526 or 1506 BC according to the high and low estimates of her reign, respectively.[15] The length of the reigns of Tuthmosis I and Tuthmosis II, however, cannot be determined with absolute certainty. With short reigns, Hatshepsut would have ascended the throne 14 years after the coronation of Tuthmosis I, her father.[16] Longer reigns would put her ascension 25 years after Tuthmosis I's coronation.[15] Thus, Hatshepsut could have assumed power as early as 1512 BC, or, as late as 1479 BC.\\r\\nThe earliest attestation of Hatshepsut as pharaoh occurs in the tomb of Ramose and Hatnofer, where a collection of grave goods contained a single pottery jar or amphora from the tomb's chamberwhich was stamped with the date Year 7.[17] Another jar from the same tombwhich was discovered in situ by a 1935ÿ36 Metropolitan Museum of Art expedition on a hillside near Thebeswas stamped with the seal of the \\"God's Wife Hatshepsut\\" while two jars bore the seal of The Good Goddess Maatkare.[18] The dating of the amphorae, \\"sealed into the [tomb's] burial chamber by the debris from Senenmut's own tomb,\\" is undisputed, which means that Hatshepsut was acknowledged as king, and not queen, of Egypt by Year 7 of her reign.[18]\\r\\nHatshepsut established the trade networks that had been disrupted during the Hyksos occupation of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, thereby building the wealth of the eighteenth dynasty. She oversaw the preparations and funding for a mission to the Land of Punt. This trading expedition to Punt was roughly during Hatshepsut's ninth year of reign. It set out in her name with five ships, each measuring 70?feet (21 m) long bearing several sails[dubious ÿ discuss] and accommodating 210 men that included sailors and 30 rowers.[citation needed] Many trade goods were bought in Punt, notably frankincense and myrrh.\\r\\nHatshepsut's delegation returned from Punt bearing 31 live myrrh trees, the roots of which were carefully kept in baskets for the duration of the voyage. This was the first recorded attempt to transplant foreign trees. It is reported that Hatshepsut had these trees planted in the courts of her mortuary temple complex. Egyptians also returned with a number of other gifts from Punt, among which was frankincense.[19] Hatshepsut would grind the charred frankincense into kohl eyeliner. This is the first recorded use of the resin.[20]\\r\\nHatshepsut had the expedition commemorated in relief at Deir el-Bahri, which is also famous for its realistic depiction of the Queen of the Land of Punt, Queen Ati.[21] The Puntite Queen is portrayed as relatively tall and her physique was generously proportioned, with large breasts and rolls of fat on her body. Due to the fat deposits on her buttocks, it has sometimes been argued that she may have had steatopygia. However, according to the pathologist Marc Armand Ruffer, the main characteristic of a steatopygous woman is a disproportion in size between the buttocks and thighs, which was not the case with Ati. She instead appears to have been generally obese, a condition that was exaggerated by excessive lordosis or curvature of the lower spine.[22] Hatshepsut also sent raiding expeditions to Byblos and Sinai shortly after the Punt expedition. Very little is known about these expeditions. Although many Egyptologists have claimed that her foreign policy was mainly peaceful,[21] it is possible that she led military campaigns against Nubia and Canaan.[23]\\r\\nHatshepsut was one of the most prolific builders in ancient Egypt, commissioning hundreds of construction projects throughout both Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt. Arguably, her buildings were grander and more numerous than those of any of her Middle Kingdom predecessors'. Later pharaohs attempted to claim some of her projects as theirs. She employed the great architect Ineni, who also had worked for her father, her husband, and for the royal steward Senemut. During her reign, so much statuary was produced that almost every major museum with Ancient Egyptian artefacts in the world has Hatshepsut statuary among their collections; for instance, the Hatshepsut Room in New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art is dedicated solely to some of these pieces.\\r\\nFollowing the tradition of most pharaohs, Hatshepsut had monuments constructed at the Temple of Karnak. She also restored the original Precinct of Mut, the ancient great goddess of Egypt, at Karnak that had been ravaged by the foreign rulers during the Hyksos occupation. It later was ravaged by other pharaohs, who took one part after another to use in their pet projects and awaits restoration. She had twin obelisks, at the time the tallest in the world, erected at the entrance to the temple. One still stands, as the tallest surviving ancient obelisk on Earth; the other has broken in two and toppled. The official in charge for those obelisks was the high steward Amenhotep.[24]\\r\\nAnother project, Karnak's Red Chapel, or Chapelle Rouge, was intended as a barque shrine and originally may have stood between her two obelisks. It was lined with carved stones that depicted significant events in Hatshepsut's life.\\r\\nShe later ordered the construction of two more obelisks to celebrate her 16th year as pharaoh; one of the obelisks broke during construction and a third was therefore constructed to replace it. The broken obelisk was left at its quarrying site in Aswan, where it still remains. Known as The Unfinished Obelisk, it demonstrates how obelisks were quarried.[25]\\r\\nThe Temple of Pakhet was built by Hatshepsut at Beni Hasan in the Minya Governorate south of Al Minya. The name, Pakhet, was a synthesis that occurred by combining Bast and Sekhmet, who were similar lioness war goddesses, in an area that bordered the north and south division of their cults. The cavernous underground temple, cut into the rock cliffs on the eastern side of the Nile, was admired and called the Speos Artemidos by the Greeks during their occupation of Egypt, known as the Ptolemaic Dynasty. They saw the goddess as akin to their hunter goddess Artemis. The temple is thought to have been built alongside much more ancient ones that have not survived. This temple has an architrave with a long dedicatory text bearing Hatshepsut's famous denunciation of the Hyksos that has been translated by James P. Allen.[26] They had occupied Egypt and cast it into a cultural decline that persisted until a revival brought about by her policies and innovations. This temple was altered later and some of its inside decorations were usurped by Seti I, in the nineteenth dynasty, attempting to have his name replace that of Hatshepsut.\\r\\nFollowing the tradition of many pharaohs, the masterpiece of Hatshepsut's building projects was a mortuary temple. She built hers in a complex at Deir el-Bahri. It was designed and implemented by Senenmut at a site on the West Bank of the Nile River near the entrance to what now is called the Valley of the Kings because of all the pharaohs who later chose to associate their complexes with the grandeur of hers. Her buildings were the first grand ones planned for that location.\\r\\nThe focal point was the Djeser-Djeseru or \\"the Sublime of Sublimes\\", a colonnaded structure of perfect harmony nearly one thousand years before the Parthenon was built. Djeser-Djeseru sits atop a series of terraces that once were graced with lush gardens. Djeser-Djeseru is built into a cliff face that rises sharply above it. Djeser-Djeseru and the other buildings of Hatshepsut's Deir el-Bahri complex are considered to be significant advances in architecture. Another one of her great accomplishments is the Hatshepsut needle[27] (also known as the granite obelisks).\\r\\nAlthough it was uncommon for Egypt to be ruled by a woman, the situation was not unprecedented. As a regent, Hatshepsut was preceded by Merneith of the first dynasty, who was buried with the full honors of a pharaoh and may have ruled in her own right. Nimaathap of the third dynasty may have been the dowager of Khasekhemwy, but certainly acted as regent for her son, Djoser, and may have reigned as pharaoh in her own right.[28] Nitocris may have been the last pharaoh of the sixth dynasty. Her name is found in the Histories of Herodotus and writings of Manetho, but her historicity is uncertain. Queen Sobekneferu of the twelfth dynasty is known to have assumed formal power as ruler of \\"Upper and Lower Egypt\\" three centuries earlier than Hatshepsut. Ahhotep I, lauded as a warrior queen, may have been a regent between the reigns of two of her sons, Kamose and Ahmose I, at the end of the seventeenth dynasty and the beginning of Hatshepsut's own eighteenth dynasty. Amenhotep I, also preceding Hatshepsut in the eighteenth dynasty, probably came to power while a young child and his mother, Ahmose-Nefertari, is thought to have been a regent for him.[29] Other women whose possible reigns as pharaohs are under study include Akhenaten's possible female co-regent/successor (usually identified as either Nefertiti or Meritaten) and Twosre. Among the later, non-indigenous Egyptian dynasties, the most notable example of another woman who became pharaoh was Cleopatra VII, the last pharaoh of Ancient Egypt. Perhaps in an effort to ease anxiety over the prospect of a female pharaoh, Hatshepsut claimed a divine right to rule based on the authority of the god Amun.[30]\\r\\nIn comparison with other female pharaohs, Hatshepsut's reign was much longer and more prosperous. She was successful in warfare early in her reign, but generally is considered to be a pharaoh who inaugurated a long peaceful era. She re-established international trading relationships lost during a foreign occupation and brought great wealth to Egypt. That wealth enabled Hatshepsut to initiate building projects that raised the calibre of Ancient Egyptian architecture to a standard, comparable to classical architecture, that would not be rivaled by any other culture for a thousand years. She managed to rule for about 20 years. One of the most famous things that she did was build Hatshepsut's temple (see above).\\r\\nHyperbole is common to virtually all royal inscriptions of Egyptian history. While all ancient leaders used it to laud their achievements, Hatshepsut has been called the most accomplished pharaoh at promoting her accomplishments.[31] This may have resulted from the extensive building executed during her time as pharaoh, in comparison with many others. It afforded her many opportunities to laud herself, but it also reflected the wealth that her policies and administration brought to Egypt, enabling her to finance such projects. Aggrandizement of their achievements was traditional when pharaohs built temples and their tombs.\\r\\nWomen had a relatively high status in ancient Egypt and enjoyed the legal right to own, inherit, or will property. A woman becoming pharaoh was rare, however; only Sobekneferu, Khentkaus I and possibly Nitocris preceded her.[32] The existence of this last ruler is disputed and is probably a mis-translation of a male king. Nefernferuaten and Twosret may have been the only women to succeed her among the indigenous rulers. In Egyptian history, there was no word for a \\"queen regnant\\" as in contemporary history, \\"king\\" being the Ancient Egyptian title regardless of gender, and by the time of her reign, pharaoh had become the name for the ruler. Hatshepsut is not unique, however, in taking the title of king. Sobekneferu, ruling six dynasties prior to Hatshepsut, also did so when she ruled Egypt. Hatshepsut had been well trained in her duties as the daughter of the pharaoh. During her father's reign she held the powerful office of God's Wife. She had taken a strong role as queen to her husband and was well experienced in the administration of her kingdom by the time she became pharaoh. There is no indication of challenges to her leadership and, until her death, her co-regent remained in a secondary role, quite amicably heading her powerful armywhich would have given him the power necessary to overthrow a usurper of his rightful place, if that had been the case.\\r\\nHatshepsut assumed all of the regalia and symbols of the pharaonic office in official representations: the Khat head cloth, topped with the uraeus, the traditional false beard, and shendyt kilt.[31] Many existing statues alternatively show her in typically feminine attire as well as those that depict her in the royal ceremonial attire. Statues portraying Sobekneferu also combine elements of traditional male and female iconography and, by tradition, may have served as inspiration for these works commissioned by Hatshepsut.[33] After this period of transition ended, however, most formal depictions of Hatshepsut as pharaoh showed her in the royal attire, with all of the pharaonic regalia.\\r\\nAt her mortuary temple, in Osirian statues that regaled the transportation of the pharaoh to the world of the dead, the symbols of the pharaoh as the deity Osiris were the reason for the attire and they were much more important to be displayed traditionally, her breasts are obscured behind her crossed arms holding the regal staffs of the two kingdoms she ruled. This became a pointed concern among writers who sought reasons for the generic style of the shrouded statues and led to misinterpretations. Understanding of the religious symbolism was required to interpret the statues correctly. Interpretations by these early scholars varied and often, were baseless conjectures of their own contemporary values. The possible reasons for her breasts not being emphasized in the most formal statues were debated among some early Egyptologists, who failed to understand the ritual religious symbolism, to take into account the fact that many women and goddesses portrayed in ancient Egyptian art often lack delineation of breasts, and that the physical aspect of the gender of pharaohs was never stressed in the art. With few exceptions, subjects were idealized.\\r\\nModern scholars, however, have theorized that by assuming the typical symbols of pharaonic power, Hatshepsut was asserting her claim to be the sovereign rather than a \\"King's Great Wife\\" or queen consort. The gender of pharaohs was never stressed in official depictions; even the men were depicted with the highly stylized false beard associated with their position in the society.\\r\\nMoreover, the Osirian statues of Hatshepsutas with other pharaohsdepict the dead pharaoh as Osiris, with the body and regalia of that deity. All of the statues of Hatshepsut at her tomb follow that tradition. The promise of resurrection after death was a tenet of the cult of Osiris. Since many statues of Hatshepsut depicted in this fashion have been put on display in museums and those images have been widely published, viewers who lack an understanding of the religious significance of these depictions have been misled. Aside from the face depicting Hatshepsut, these statues closely resemble those of other kings as Osiris, following religious traditions.\\r\\nMost of the official statues commissioned of Hatshepsut show her less symbolically and more naturally, as a woman in typical dresses of the nobility of her day. Notably, even after assuming the formal regalia, Hatshepsut still described herself as a beautiful woman, often as the most beautiful of women, and although she assumed almost all of her father's titles, she declined to take the title \\"The Strong Bull\\" (the full title being, The Strong Bull of his Mother), which tied the pharaoh to the goddesses Isis, the throne, and Hathor, (the cow who gave birth to and protected the pharaohs)by being her son sitting on her thronean unnecessary title for her, since Hatshepsut became allied with the goddesses, herself, which no male pharaoh could. Rather than the strong bull, Hatshepsut, having served as a very successful warrior during the early portion of her reign as pharaoh, associated herself with the lioness image of Sekhmet, the major war deity in the Egyptian pantheon.\\r\\nReligious concepts were tied into all of these symbols and titles. By the time of Hatshepsut's reign, the merger of some aspects of these two goddesses provided that they would both have given birth to, and were the protectors of, the pharaohs. They became interchangeable at times. Hatshepsut also traced her lineage to Mut, a primal mother goddess of the Egyptian pantheon, which gave her another ancestor who was a deity as well as her father and grandfathers, pharaohs who would have become deified upon death.\\r\\nWhile Hatshepsut was depicted in official art wearing regalia of a pharaoh, such as the false beard that male pharaohs also wore, it is most unlikely that she ever wore such ceremonial decorations, just as it is unlikely that the male pharaohs did. Statues such as those at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, depicting her seated wearing a tight-fitting dress and the nemes crown, are thought to be a more accurate representation of how she would have presented herself at court.[34]\\r\\nAs a notable exception, only one male pharaoh abandoned the rigid symbolic depiction that had become the style of the most official artwork representing the ruler, Pharaoh Amenhotep IV (later Akhenaten) of the same eighteenth dynasty, whose wife, Nefertiti, also may have ruled in her own right following the death of her husband.\\r\\nOne of the most famous examples of the legends about Hatshepsut is a myth about her birth. In this myth, Amun goes to Ahmose in the form of Thutmose I and awakens her with pleasant odors. At this point Amun places the ankh, a symbol of life, to Ahmose's nose, and Hatshepsut is conceived by Ahmose. Khnum, the god who forms the bodies of human children, is then instructed to create a body and ka, or corporal presence/life force, for Hatshepsut. Heket, the goddess of life and fertility, and Khnum then lead Ahmose along to a lioness' bed where she gives birth to Hatshepsut. Reliefs depicting each step in these events are at Karnak and in her mortuary temple.\\r\\nThe Oracle of Amun proclaimed that it was the will of Amun that Hatshepsut be pharaoh, further strengthening her position. She reiterated Amun's support by having these proclamations by the god Amun carved on her monuments:\\r\\nWelcome my sweet daughter, my favorite, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkare, Hatshepsut. Thou art the Pharaoh, taking possession of the Two Lands.[35]\\r\\nHatshepsut claimed that she was her father's intended heir and that he made her the heir apparent of Egypt. Almost all scholars today view this as historical revisionism, or prolepsis, on Hatshepsut's part since it was Thutmose IIa son of Thutmose I by Mutnofretwho was her father's heir. Moreover, Thutmose I could not have foreseen that his daughter Hatshepsut would outlive his son within his own lifetime. Thutmose II soon married Hatshepsut and the latter became both his senior royal wife and the most powerful woman at court. Biographer Evelyn Wells, however, accepts Hatshepsut's claim that she was her father's intended successor. Once she became pharaoh herself, Hatshepsut supported her assertion that she was her father's designated successor with inscriptions on the walls of her mortuary temple:\\r\\nThen his majesty said to them: \\"This daughter of mine, Khnumetamun Hatshepsutmay she live!I have appointed as my successor upon my throne... she shall direct the people in every sphere of the palace; it is she indeed who shall lead you. Obey her words, unite yourselves at her command.\\" The royal nobles, the dignitaries, and the leaders of the people heard this proclamation of the promotion of his daughter, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkaremay she live eternally.[36]\\r\\nAmerican humorist Will Cuppy wrote an essay on Hatshepsut which was published after his death in the book The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody. Regarding one of her wall inscriptions, he wrote,\\r\\nFor a general notion of Hatshepsut's appearance at a certain stage of her career, we are indebted to one of those wall inscriptions. It states that \\"to look upon her was more beautiful than anything; her splendor and her form were divine.\\" Some have thought it odd that the female Pharaoh should have been so bold, fiftyish as she was. Not at all. She was merely saying how things were about thirty-five years back, before she had married Thutmose II and slugged it out with Thutmose III. \\"She was a maiden, beautiful and blooming\\", the hieroglyphics run, and we have no reason to doubt it. Surely there is no harm in telling the world how one looked in 1515 B.C.[37]\\r\\nHatshepsut died as she was approaching what we would consider middle age given typical contemporary lifespans, in her twenty-second regnal year.[38] The precise date of Hatshepsut's deathand the time when Thutmose III became the next pharaoh of Egyptis considered to be Year 22, II Peret day 10 of her reign, as recorded on a single stela erected at Armant[39] or January 16, 1458 BC.[40] This information validates the basic reliability of Manetho's kinglist records since Hatshepsut's known accession date was I Shemu day 4[41] (i.e.: Hatshepsut died nine months into her 22nd year as king, as Manetho writes in his Epitome for a reign of 21 years and nine months). No contemporary mention of the cause of her death has survived. If the recent identification of her mummy is correct, however, the medical evidence would indicate that she suffered from diabetes and died from bone cancer which had spread throughout her body while she was in her fifties.[3][42] It also would suggest that she had arthritis and bad teeth.[3]\\r\\nHatshepsut had begun construction of a tomb when she was the Great Royal Wife of Thutmose II, but the scale of this was not suitable for a pharaoh, so when she ascended the throne, preparation for another burial started. For this, KV20, originally quarried for her father, Thutmose I, and probably the first royal tomb in the Valley of the Kings, was extended with a new burial chamber. Hatshepsut also refurbished the burial of her father and prepared for a double interment of both Thutmose I and her within KV20. It is likely, therefore, that when she died (no later than the twenty-second year of her reign), she was interred in this tomb along with her father.[43] During the reign of Thutmose III, however, a new tomb, (KV38), together with new burial equipment was provided for Thutmose I, who then was removed from his original tomb and re-interred elsewhere. At the same time Hatshepsut's mummy might have been moved into the tomb of her nurse, Sitre In, in KV60. It is possible that Amenhotep II, son to Thutmose III by a secondary wife, was the one motivating these actions in an attempt to assure his own uncertain right to succession. Besides what was recovered from KV20 during Howard Carter's clearance of the tomb in 1903, other funerary furniture belonging to Hatshepsut has been found elsewhere, including a lioness \\"throne\\" (bedstead is a better description), a senet game board with carved lioness-headed, red-jasper game pieces bearing her pharaonic title, a signet ring, and a partial shabti figurine bearing her name. In the Royal Mummy Cache at DB320, a wooden canopic box with an ivory knob was found that was inscribed with the name of Hatshepsut and contained a mummified liver or spleen as well as a molar tooth. There was a royal lady of the twenty-first dynasty of the same name, however, and for a while it was thought possible that it could have belonged to her instead.[44]\\r\\nIn 1903, Howard Carter had discovered a tomb (KV60) in the Valley of the Kings that contained two female mummies, one identified as Hatshepsut's wetnurse, and the other unidentified. In the spring of 2007, the unidentified body was finally removed from the tomb by Dr. Zahi Hawass and brought to Cairo's Egyptian Museum for testing. This mummy was missing a tooth, and the space in the jaw perfectly matched Hatshepsut's existing molar, found in the DB320 \\"canopic box\\".[45][46] Her death has since been attributed to a carcinogenic skin lotion found in possession of the Pharaoh, which led to her having bone cancer. \\"There is a lot that speaks for this hypothesis,\\" according to Helmut Wiedenfeld of the University of Bonn's pharmaceutical institute. \\"If you imagine that the queen had a chronic skin disease and that she found short-term improvement from the salve, she may have exposed herself to a great risk over the years.\\"[47]\\r\\nToward the end of the reign of Thutmose III and into the reign of his son, an attempt was made to remove Hatshepsut from certain historical and pharaonic records. This elimination was carried out in the most literal way possible. Her cartouches and images were chiselled off some stone walls, leaving very obvious Hatshepsut-shaped gaps in the artwork.\\r\\nAt the Deir el-Bahari temple, Hatshepsut's numerous statues were torn down and in many cases, smashed or disfigured before being buried in a pit. At Karnak, there even was an attempt to wall up her obelisks. While it is clear that much of this rewriting of Hatshepsut's history occurred only during the close of Thutmose III's reign, it is not clear why it happened, other than the typical pattern of self-promotion that existed among the pharaohs and their administrators, or perhaps saving money by not building new monuments for the burial of Thutmose III and instead, using the grand structures built by Hatshepsut.\\r\\nAmenhotep II, the son of Thutmose III, who became a co-regent toward the end of his father's reign, is suspected by some as being the defacer during the end of the reign of a very old pharaoh. He would have had a motive because his position in the royal lineage was not so strong as to assure his elevation to pharaoh. He is documented, further, as having usurped many of Hatshepsut's accomplishments during his own reign. His reign is marked with attempts to break the royal lineage as well, not recording the names of his queens and eliminating the powerful titles and official roles of royal women, such as God's Wife of Amun.[48]\\r\\nFor many years, presuming that it was Thutmose III acting out of resentment once he became pharaoh, early modern Egyptologists presumed that the erasures were similar to the Roman damnatio memoriae. This appeared to make sense when thinking that Thutmose might have been an unwilling co-regent for years. This assessment of the situation probably is too simplistic, however. It is highly unlikely that the determined and focused Thutmosenot only Egypt's most successful general, but an acclaimed athlete, author, historian, botanist, and architectwould have brooded for two decades of his own reign before attempting to avenge himself on his stepmother and aunt. According to renowned Egyptologist Donald Redford:\\r\\nHere and there, in the dark recesses of a shrine or tomb where no plebeian eye could see, the queen's cartouche and figure were left intact ... which never vulgar eye would again behold, still conveyed for the king the warmth and awe of a divine presence.[49]\\r\\nThe erasures were sporadic and haphazard, with only the more visible and accessible images of Hatshepsut being removed; had it been more complete, we would not now have so many images of Hatshepsut. Thutmose III may have died before these changes were finished and it may be that he never intended a total obliteration of her memory. In fact, we have no evidence to support the assumption that Thutmose hated or resented Hatshepsut during her lifetime. Had that been true, as head of the army, in a position given to him by Hatshepsut (who was clearly not worried about her co-regent's loyalty), he surely could have led a successful coup, but he made no attempt to challenge her authority during her reign and, her accomplishments and images remained featured on all of the public buildings she built for twenty years after her death.\\r\\nJoyce Tyldesley hypothesized that it is possible that Thutmose III, lacking any sinister motivation, may have decided toward the end of his life to relegate Hatshepsut to her expected place as the regentwhich was the traditional role of powerful women in Egypt's court as the example of Queen Ahhotep attestsrather than king. Tyldesley fashions her concept as, that by eliminating the more obvious traces of Hatshepsut's monuments as pharaoh and reducing her status to that of his co-regent, Thutmose III could claim that the royal succession ran directly from Thutmose II to Thutmose III without any interference from his aunt.\\r\\nThe deliberate erasures or mutilations of the numerous public celebrations of her accomplishments, but not the rarely seen ones, would be all that was necessary to obscure Hatshepsut's accomplishments. Moreover, by the latter half of Thutmose III's reign, the more prominent high officials who had served Hatshepsut would have died, thereby eliminating the powerful religious and bureaucratic resistance to a change in direction in a highly stratified culture. Hatshepsut's highest official and closest supporter, Senenmut, seems either to have retired abruptly or died around Years 16 and 20 of Hatshepsut's reign, and was never interred in either of his carefully prepared tombs.[50] According to Tyldesley, the enigma of Senenmut's sudden disappearance \\"teased Egyptologists for decades\\" given \\"the lack of solid archaeological or textual evidence\\" and permitted \\"the vivid imagination of Senenmut-scholars to run wild\\" resulting in a variety of strongly held solutions \\"some of which would do credit to any fictional murder/mystery plot.\\"[51] In such a scenario, newer court officials, appointed by Thutmose III, also would have had an interest in promoting the many achievements of their master in order to assure the continued success of their own families.\\r\\nPresuming that it was Thutmose III (rather than his co-regent son), Tyldesley also put forth a hypothesis about Thutmose suggesting that his erasures and defacement of Hatshepsut's monuments could have been a cold, but rational attempt on his part to extinguish the memory of an \\"unconventional female king whose reign might possibly be interpreted by future generations as a grave offence against Ma'at, and whose unorthodox coregency\\" could \\"cast serious doubt upon the legitimacy of his own right to rule. Hatshepsut's crime need not be anything more than the fact that she was a woman.\\"[52] Tyldesley conjectured that Thutmose III may have considered the possibility that the example of a successful female king in Egyptian history could demonstrate that a woman was as capable at governing Egypt as a traditional male king, which could persuade \\"future generations of potentially strong female kings\\" to not \\"remain content with their traditional lot as wife, sister and eventual mother of a king\\" and assume the crown.[53] Dismissing relatively recent history known to Thutmose III of another woman who was king, Sobekneferu of Egypt's Middle Kingdom, she conjectured further that he might have thought that while she had enjoyed a short, approximately four-year reign, she ruled \\"at the very end of a fading [12th dynasty] Dynasty, and from the very start of her reign the odds had been stacked against her. She was, therefore, acceptable to conservative Egyptians as a patriotic 'Warrior Queen' who had failed\\" to rejuvenate Egypt's fortunes.[2] In contrast, Hatshepsut's glorious reign was a completely different case: she demonstrated that women were as capable as men of ruling the two lands since she successfully presided over a prosperous Egypt for more than two decades.[2] If Thutmose III's intent was to forestall the possibility of a woman assuming the throne, as proposed by Tyldesley, it was a failure since Twosret and Neferneferuaten (possibly), a female co-regent or successor of Akhenaten, assumed the throne for short reigns as pharaoh later in the New Kingdom.\\r\\nThe erasure of Hatshepsut's namewhatever the reason or the person ordering italmost caused her to disappear from Egypt's archaeological and written records. When nineteenth-century Egyptologists started to interpret the texts on the Deir el-Bahri temple walls (which were illustrated with two seemingly male kings) their translations made no sense. Jean-Fran?ois Champollion, the French decoder of hieroglyphs, was not alone in feeling confused by the obvious conflict between words and pictures:\\r\\nIf I felt somewhat surprised at seeing here, as elsewhere throughout the temple, the renowned Moeris [Thutmose III], adorned with all the insignia of royalty, giving place to this Amenenthe [Hatshepsut], for whose name we may search the royal lists in vain, still more astonished was I to find upon reading the inscriptions that wherever they referred to this bearded king in the usual dress of the Pharaohs, nouns and verbs were in the feminine, as though a queen were in question. I found the same peculiarity everywhere...[54]\\r\\nThe \\"Hatshepsut Problem\\" was a major issue in late 19th century and early 20th century Egyptology, centering on confusion and disagreement on the order of succession of early 18th dynasty pharaohs. The dilemma takes its name from confusion over the chronology of the rule of Queen Hatshepsut and Thutmose I, II, and III.[55] In its day, the problem was controversial enough to cause academic feuds between leading Egyptologists and created perceptions about the early Thutmosid family that persisted well into the 20th century, the influence of which still can be found in more recent works. Chronology-wise, the Hatshepsut problem was largely cleared up in the late 20th century, as more information about her and her reign was uncovered.\\r\\nThe 2006 discovery of a foundation deposit including nine golden cartouches bearing the names of both Hatshepsut and Thutmose III in Karnak may shed additional light on the eventual attempt by Thutmose III and his son Amenhotep II to erase Hatshepsut from the historical record and the correct nature of their relationships and her role as pharaoh.[56]\\r\\nSphinx of Hatshepsut with unusual rounded ears and ruff that stress the lioness features of the statue, but with five toes - newel post decorations from the lower ramp of her tomb complex\\r\\nThese two statues once resembled each other, however, the symbols of her pharaonic power: the Uraeus, Double Crown, and traditional false beard have been stripped from the left image; many images portraying Hatshepsut were destroyed or vandalized within decades of her death, possibly by Amenhotep II at the end of the reign of Thutmose III, while he was his co-regent, in order to assure his own rise to pharaoh and then, to claim many of her accomplishments as his.\\r\\nThe image of Hatshepsut has been deliberately chipped away and removed - Ancient Egyptian wing of the Royal Ontario Museum\\r\\nDual stela of Hatshepsut (centre left) in the blue Khepresh crown offering wine to the deity Amun and Thutmose III behind her in the hedjet white crown, standing near Wosret - Vatican Museum\\r\\nHieroglyphs showing Thutmose III on the left and Hatshepsut on the right, she having the trappings of the greater role?

County commissions are usually made up of three or more individuals. In some counties in Georgia however, a sole commissioner holds the authority of the commission. (See National Association of Counties http://www.naco.org)\\r\\nThe commission acts as the executive of the local government, levies local taxes, administers county governmental services such as prisons, courts, public health oversight, property registration, building code enforcement, and public works such as road maintenance.

This was one of the largest land grants to an individual in history.[4] It was called Pennsylvania. William Penn, who wanted it called New Wales or Sylvania, was embarrassed at the change, fearing that people would think he had named it after himself, but King Charles would not rename the grant.[5] Penn established a government with two innovations that were much copied in the New World: the county commission and freedom of religious conviction.[4]","input":"What does a county board of commissioners do?"},{"output":"Abyssinia","context":"The art of printing first entered India through Goa. In a letter to St. Ignatius of Loyola, dated 30 April 1556, Father Gasper Caleza speaks of a ship carrying a printing press setting sail for Abyssinia from Portugal, with the purpose of helping missionary work in Abyssinia. Circumstances prevented this printing press from leaving India, and consequently, printing was initiated in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is evidence that the use of the concept of mass duplication in India dates back to the time of the Indus Valley Civilization. Grants of land were originally recorded by engraving the information on copper plates and etchings on different surfaces like wood, bone, ivory and shells. However, printing arrived about a hundred years after the Gutenberg Bible was first printed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany factors contributed to the necessity of the initiation of printing in the subcontinent, the primary being evangelization and the Jesuits were solely responsible for this. Francis Xavier is known to have been teaching the Bible in Tharangambadi (Tranquebar), Tamil Nadu around 1542. Also, when the Viceroy of Goa, on behalf of King Joao III of Portugal, opened schools for Indians, Francis Xavier pressured Portugal to make printing presses available to India, Ethiopia and Japan. Meanwhile, the Emperor of Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) also requested Portugal to send a press along with missionaries. Consequently, the first batch of Jesuit missionaries, along with the printing press, left for Ethiopia on March 29, 1556, on a Spanish ship. The Patriarch designate of Abyssinia, Joao Nunes Barreto, as well as a team of technicians accompanied the press.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prevalent route from Portugal to Abyssinia then required ships to round the Cape of Good Hope, touch Goa and reach Abyssinia. The press thus reached Goa, but soon after, news reached Goa that the Abyssinian Emperor was not keen on receiving the missionaries. Around the same time, the clergy in Goa felt the need for a printing press and on their request to the then Governor-General the press was made available to them. Thus, the press stayed in Goa. This was after Mexico had seen its first printing press, but preceded the press in Lima. The Patriarch designate Barreto was detained in Goa and it appears he never left India, but died in Goa on December 22, 1562.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrinting operations began in Goa in 1556 (with the first printing press being established at the Jesuit Saint Paul's College in Old Goa), resulting in the publication of Conclusiones Philosophicas. 1557 saw the posthumous printing of St. Francis Xaviers Catecismo da Doutrina Christa five years after the death of its author. No extant copy of this work is however, available.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe individual responsible for the initiation of printing in India was one Joao De Bustamante (rechristened Joao Rodrigues in 1563), a Spaniard who joined the Society of Jesus in 1556. Bustamante, who was an expert printer, along with his Indian assistant set up the new press and began to operate it. Among others, four books are known to have been printed by Bustamante:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest, surviving printed book in India is the Compendio Spiritual Da Vide Christaa (Spiritual Compendium of the Christian life) of Gaspar Jorge de Le?o Pereira, the Portuguese Archbishop of Goa. It was printed by Joao Quinquencio in 1561 and re-edited by Manuel de Araujo in 1600, and was embellished with ornate woodcut initials on each opening chapter. This was followed by the printing of Garcia da Ortas Col܇quios dos simples e drogas he cousas medicinais da ndia on 10 April 1563 by Joao de Endem. In 1568, the first illustrated cover page (the illustration being done with the relief technique of woodblock) was printed in Goa for the book Constituciones Do Arcebispado De Goa.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother Spaniard to play a major role in the history of printing in India was Joao Gonsalves, who is credited with preparing the first printing types of an Indian script- Tamil. However, since they were not satisfactory, new casts were made in Quilon(Kollam) by Father Joao da Faria. On 20 October 1578, these types were used to print the first book in an Indian language in India (the first Tamil book was printed in Lisbon in 1554 in Romanized Tamil script.)- Henrique Henriquess Doctrina Christam en Lingua Malauar Tamul ÿ Tampiran Vanakam, a Tamil translation of St Francis Xaviers Doutrina Christa. This 16 page book of prayers and catechetical instructions was printed in Quilon. Though no extant copies of the first edition are available, MSS copies dating 1548-1614 are preserved in Lisbon and Rome. It should be mentioned here that Henriques was inducted into the Society of Jesus with the express intention of sending him to India to assist Francis Xavier. After the first press, a second press was set up. Not much is known about it save that it belonged to John Quinquencio and John Endem. The third press was set up in the St. Ignatius College, Rachol. Though Devanagari types were cast in 1577, the Christa Purana - an epic poem on the life of Jesus Christ written in the literary form of the Hindu puranas - was published not in Devanagari, but in the Roman script in the College of Rachol (1616 and 1649) and the College of St Paul (1654). This was primarily because of the clumsy shapes of the Devanagari types. In 1626, Diogo Reberio compiled the Vocabulario da lingoa Canarim (A Vocabulary of Konkani language) a Konkani-Portuguese and Portuguese-Konkani dictionary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 17th century saw the beginning of a large-scale book-printing in Goa, egged on massively by the need to print Christian texts for the benefit of the newly converted Christians. This time also saw a shift from the use of coercion to that of religious education for conversions. Thus, a number of books were printed in Konkani and Marathi due to the initiative of, among others, Father Thomas Stephens (who, in 1640, produced the first Konkani Grammar- the Arte de Lingua Canarin and in 1622, published Doutrina Christam em lingoa Bramana Canarim, ordenada a maneira de dialogo, pera ensinar os mininos, por Thomas Estevao, Collegio de Rachol  or  Christian Doctrines in the Canarese Brahmin Language, arranged in dialogue to teach children, which was the first book in Konkani and any Indian language), Father Antonio Saldanha, Father Etienne do la Croix, Father Miguel do Almeida and  Father Diogo Ribeiro (whose Declara?am da Doutrina Christam, or Exposition of Christian Doctrine in Konkani was printed in 1632). Despite the efforts of Father Stephens and the general familiarity of the Devanagari script, it was found easier to cast not Devanagari, but Roman types for Konkani. This was one of the major factors that alienated Konkani from other Indian languages, since the Roman script failed to fix a number of Konkani sounds that the Europeans faced difficulty in pronouncing. It was, however, this adoption of the Roman script for printing in the vernacular helped printing to flourish in Goa till 1684, when the official decree suppressed the vernacular languages and printing suffered a setback. Printing in Tamil stopped after 1612, and the last books printed in Latin and Portuguese before printing fairly died were published in 1674.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not till 1706 when Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg, a Danish missionary, arrived at Tharangambadi that printing in India could flourish again. A printing press arrived around 1712-13 and the Tranquebar Press produced its first publications. On Ziegenbalgs insistence, the first Tamil publication from the press reached the mass in 1713, followed by the New Testament in 1714.[1] It was as late as 1821 that printing was revived in Goa with the starting of a weekly called Gazeta de Goa, later known as the Chronista Constitucional de Goa (1835) and still later, the Boletim de Governo do Estado da India (1837).\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1940 to 1960 there were four to six printers in Goa, of which the prominent ones were JD Fernandes, Gomantak Printers and Borkar Printers. Smaller entrepreneurs also joined the fray. One of these was a teacher in a local school in Churchorem.

He received every military combat award for valor available from the U.S. Army, as well as French and Belgian awards for heroism. Murphy received the Medal of Honor for valor that he demonstrated at the age of 19 for single-handedly holding off an entire company of German soldiers for an hour at the Colmar Pocket in France in January 1945, then leading a successful counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition. Murphy was born into a large family of sharecroppers in Hunt County, Texas. His father abandoned them, and his mother died when he was a teenager. Murphy left school in fifth grade to pick cotton and find other work to help support his family; his skill with a hunting rifle was a necessity for putting food on the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Murphy's older sister helped him to falsify documentation about his birthdate in order to meet the minimum-age requirement for enlisting in the military. Turned down by the Navy and the Marine Corps, he enlisted in the Army. He first saw action in the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily; then in 1944 he participated in the Battle of Anzio, the liberation of Rome, and the invasion of southern France. Murphy fought at Montlimar and led his men on a successful assault at the L'Omet quarry near Cleurie in northeastern France in October.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the war, Murphy embarked on a 21-year acting career. He played himself in the 1955 autobiographical film To Hell and Back, based on his 1949 memoirs of the same name, but most of his roles were in westerns. He made guest appearances on celebrity television shows and starred in the series Whispering Smith. Murphy was a fairly accomplished songwriter. He bred quarter horses in California and Arizona, and became a regular participant in horse racing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuffering from what would today be described as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Murphy slept with a loaded handgun under his pillow. He looked for solace in addictive sleeping pills. In his last few years, he was plagued by money problems but refused offers to appear in alcohol and cigarette commercials because he did not want to set a bad example. Murphy died in a plane crash in Virginia in 1971, which was shortly before his 46th birthday. He was interred with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. His grave is one of the most visited sites in the cemetery.\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy was the seventh of twelve children born to Emmett Berry Murphy and his wife Josie Bell Killian in Kingston, Texas.[ALM 1] The Murphys were sharecroppers of Irish descent.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a child, Murphy was a loner with mood swings and an explosive temper.[8] He grew up in Texas, around Farmersville, Greenville, and Celeste, where he attended elementary school.[9] His father drifted in and out of the family's life and eventually deserted them. Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for a dollar a day (equivalent to $18 in 2017) to help support his family; he also became skilled with a rifle, hunting small game to help feed them. After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia[10] in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville.[11] Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home,[12] a Christian orphanage in Quinlan. After the war, he bought a house in Farmersville for his eldest sister Corinne and her husband, Poland Burns. His other siblings briefly shared the home.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loss of his mother stayed with Murphy throughout his life. He later stated:\\r\\nShe died when I was sixteen. She had the most beautiful hair I've ever seen. It reached almost to the floor. She rarely talked; and always seemed to be searching for something. What it was I don't know. We didn't discuss our feelings. But when she passed away, she took something of me with her. It seems I've been searching for it ever since.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy had always wanted to be a soldier. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, he tried to enlist,[11] but the Army, Navy and Marine Corps all turned him down for being underweight and underage. After his sister provided an affidavit that falsified his birth date by a year, he was accepted by the U.S. Army on 30 June 1942.[ALM 1][ALM 2] After basic training at Camp Wolters,[20]  he was sent to Fort Meade for advanced infantry training.[21] During basic training, he earned the Marksman Badge with Rifle Component Bar and Expert Badge with Bayonet Component Bar.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy was shipped to Casablanca in French Morocco on 20 February 1943. He was assigned to Company B, 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, which trained under the command of Major General Lucian Truscott.[23][24] He participated as a platoon messenger with his division at Arzew in Algeria in rigorous training for the Allied assault landings in Sicily.[25] He was promoted to private first class on 7 May and corporal on 15 July.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the 3rd Infantry landed at Licata, Sicily, on 10 July, Murphy was a division runner.[28][29] On a scouting patrol, he killed two fleeing Italian officers near Canicatt.[30] Sidelined with illness for a week when Company B arrived in Palermo on 20 July,[31] he rejoined them when they were assigned to a hillside location protecting a machine-gun emplacement, while the rest of the 3rd Infantry Division fought at San Fratello en route to the Allied capture of the transit port of Messina.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy participated in the September 1943 mainland Salerno landing at Battipaglia.[33] While on a scouting party along the Volturno River, he and two other soldiers were ambushed; German machine gun fire killed one soldier. Murphy and the other survivor responded by killing five Germans with hand grenades and machine gun fire.[34] While taking part in the October Allied assault on the Volturno Line,[33][35] near Mignano Monte Lungo Hill 193, he and his company repelled an attack by seven German soldiers, killing three and taking four prisoner.[36] Murphy was promoted to sergeant on 13 December.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1944, Murphy was promoted to staff sergeant.[37] He was hospitalized in Naples with malaria on 21 January and was unable to participate in the initial landing at the Anzio beachhead.[38] He returned on 29 January and participated in the First Battle of Cisterna,[39][40] and was made a platoon sergeant in Company B following the battle.[41] He returned with the 3rd Division to Anzio, where they remained for months.[42] Taking shelter from the weather in an abandoned farmhouse on 2 March, Murphy and his platoon killed the crew of a passing German tank.[43] He then crawled out alone close enough to destroy the tank with rifle grenades, for which he received the Bronze Star with \\"V\\" device.[44][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy continued to make scouting patrols to take German prisoners before being hospitalized for a week on 13 March with a second bout of malaria. Sixty-one infantry officers and enlisted men of Company B, 15th Infantry, including Murphy, were awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge on 8 May.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy was awarded a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Bronze Star.[47][48] American forces liberated Rome on 4 June, and Murphy remained bivouacked in Rome with his platoon throughout July.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first wave of the  Allied invasion of southern France, Murphy received the Distinguished Service Cross[50][51] for action taken on 15 August 1944.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter landing on Yellow Beach near Ramatuelle,[53] Murphy's platoon was making its way through a vineyard when the men were attacked by German soldiers. He retrieved a machine gun that had been detached from the squad and returned fire at the German soldiers, killing two and wounding one.[53] Two Germans exited a house about 100 yards (91?m) away and appeared to surrender; when Murphy's best friend responded, they shot and killed him. Murphy advanced alone on the house under direct fire. He killed six, wounded two and took 11 prisoner.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy was with the 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment during the 27ÿ28 August offensive at Montlimar that secured the area from the Germans.[52][54] Along with the other soldiers who took part in the action, he received the Presidential Unit Citation.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy's first Purple Heart was for a heel wound received in a mortar shell blast on 15 September 1944 in northeastern France.[56][57][58] His first Silver Star came after he killed four and wounded three at a German machine gun position on 2 October at L'Omet quarry in the Cleurie river valley.[50] Three days later, Murphy crawled alone towards the Germans at L'Omet, carrying an SCR-536 radio and directing his men for an hour while the Germans fired directly at him. When his men finally took the hill, 15 Germans had been killed and 35 wounded. Murphy's actions earned him a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Silver Star.[59] He was awarded a battlefield commission to second lieutenant on 14 October, which elevated him to platoon leader.[60] While en route to Brouvelieures on 26 October, the 3rd Platoon of Company B was attacked by a German sniper group. Murphy captured two before being shot in the hip by a sniper; he returned fire and shot the sniper between the eyes. At the 3rd General Hospital at Aix-en-Provence,[61] the removal of gangrene from the wound caused partial loss of his hip muscle and kept him out of combat until January.[50] Murphy received his first Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart for this injury.[62][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colmar Pocket, 850 square miles (2,200?km2) in the Vosges Mountains, had been held by German troops since November 1944.[64] On 14 January 1945, Murphy rejoined his platoon, which had been moved to the Colmar area in December.[65] He moved with the 3rd Division on 24 January to the town of Holtzwihr, where they faced a strong German counterattack.[66] He was wounded in both legs, for which he received a second Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart.[67] As the company awaited reinforcements on 26 January, he was made commander of Company B.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans scored a direct hit on an M10 tank destroyer, setting it alight, forcing the crew to abandon it.[69] Murphy ordered his men to retreat to positions in the woods, remaining alone at his post, shooting his M1 carbine and directing artillery fire via his field radio while the Germans aimed fire directly at his position.[70] Murphy mounted the abandoned, burning tank destroyer and began firing its .50 caliber machine gun at the advancing Germans, killing a squad crawling through a ditch towards him.[71] For an hour, Murphy stood on the flaming tank destroyer returning German fire from foot soldiers and advancing tanks, killing or wounding 50 Germans. He sustained a leg wound during his stand, and stopped only after he ran out of ammunition. Murphy rejoined his men, disregarding his own injury, and led them back to repel the Germans. He insisted on remaining with his men while his wounds were treated.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor his actions that day, he was awarded the Medal of Honor.[72] The 3rd Infantry Division was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for its actions at the Colmar Pocket, giving Murphy a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for the emblem.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 16 February, Murphy was promoted to first lieutenant[74] and was awarded the Legion of Merit for his service from 22 January 1944 to 18 February 1945.[75] He was moved from the front lines to Regimental Headquarters and made a liaison officer.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States additionally honored Murphy's war contributions with the American Campaign Medal,[77] the EuropeanÿAfricanÿMiddle Eastern Campaign Medal with arrowhead device and 9 campaign stars, the World War II Victory Medal,[77] and the Army of Occupation Medal with Germany Clasp.[45][77] France recognized his service with the French Legion of Honor ÿ Grade of Chevalier,[78] the French Croix de guerre with Silver Star,[79] the French Croix de guerre with Palm,[80] the French Liberation Medal[45][77] and the French Fourragre in Colors of the Croix de guerre,[45] which was authorized for all members of the 3rd Infantry Division who fought in France during World War II. Belgium awarded Murphy the Belgian Croix de guerre with 1940 Palm.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrigadier General Ralph B. Lovett and Lieutenant Colonel Hallet D. Edson recommended Murphy for the Medal of Honor.[81][82] Near Salzburg, Austria on 2 June 1945,[83] Lieutenant General A.M. Patch[15] presented Murphy with the Medal of Honor and Legion of Merit for his actions at Holtzwihr. When asked after the war why he had seized the machine gun and taken on an entire company of German infantry, he replied, \\"They were killing my friends.\\"[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy received every U.S. military combat award for valor available from the U.S. Army for his World War II service.[ALM 3]\\r\\n\\r\\nInquiries were made through official channels about the prospect of Murphy attending West Point upon his return to the United States, but he never enrolled.[6][87] According to author Don Graham, Murphy suggested the idea and then dropped it, possibly when he realized the extent of academic preparation needed to pass the entrance exam.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy was one of several military personnel who received orders on 8 June 1945 to report to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, for temporary duty and reassignment.[6][87] Upon arrival on 13 June, he was one of four assigned to Fort Sam Houston Army Ground & Services Redistribution Station and sent home for 30 days of recuperation, with permission to travel anywhere within the United States during that period.[6] While on leave, Murphy was feted with parades, banquets, and speeches.[89] He received a belated Good Conduct Medal on 21 August.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was discharged with the rank of first lieutenant at a 50 percent disability classification on 21 September and transferred to the Officers' Reserve Corps.[ALM 4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince his military service, Murphy had been plagued with insomnia and bouts of depression, and he slept with a loaded pistol under his pillow.[92][93] A post-service medical examination on 17 June 1947 revealed symptoms of headaches, vomiting, and nightmares about the war. His medical records indicated that he took sleeping pills to help prevent nightmares.[94] During the mid-1960s, he recognized his dependence on Placidyl, and locked himself alone in a hotel room for a week to successfully break the addiction.[15] Post-traumatic stress levels exacerbated his innate moodiness,[8] and surfaced in episodes that friends and professional colleagues found alarming.[95] His first wife, Dixie Wanda Hendrix, claimed he once held her at gunpoint.[96] She witnessed her husband being guilt-ridden and tearful over newsreel footage of German war orphans.[97] Murphy briefly found a creative stress outlet in writing poetry after his Army discharge. His poem \\"The Crosses Grow on Anzio\\" appeared in his book To Hell and Back,[98] but was attributed to the fictitious character Kerrigan.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an effort to draw attention to the problems of returning Korean War and Vietnam War veterans, Murphy spoke out candidly about his own problems with posttraumatic stress disorder.[100] It was known during Murphy's lifetime as \\"battle fatigue\\" and \\"shell shock\\", terminology that dated back to World War I. He called on the government to give increased consideration and study to the emotional impact of combat experiences, and to extend health care benefits to war veterans.[101][102]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of legislation introduced by U.S. Congressman Olin Teague five months after Murphy's death in 1971, the Audie L. Murphy Memorial VA Hospital[103] in San Antonio, now a part of the South Texas Veterans Health Care System, was dedicated in 1973.[104][105]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of World War II, the 36th Infantry Division reverted to state control as part of the Texas Army National Guard,[106] and Murphy's friends, Major General H. Miller Ainsworth and Brigadier General Carl L. Phinney, were the 36th's commander and deputy commander respectively. After the 25 June 1950 commencement of the Korean War, Murphy began a second military career and was commissioned as a captain in the 36th Infantry Division of the Texas Army National Guard.[107][108] He drilled new recruits in the summer training camps, and granted the Guard permission to use his name and image in recruiting materials.[109] Although he wanted to join the fighting and juggled training activities with his film career, the 36th Infantry Division was never sent to Korea.[110][111]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt his request, he transferred to inactive status on 1 October 1951 because of his film commitments with MGM Studios, and returned to active status in 1955. Murphy was promoted to the rank of major by the Texas Army National Guard in 1956 and returned to inactive status in 1957.[112] In 1969, his official separation from the Guard transferred him to the United States Army Reserve.[113] He remained with the USAR until his transfer to the Retired Reserve in 1969.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout an acting career spanning from 1948 to 1969, Murphy made more than 40 feature films and one television series.[ALM 5] When actor and producer James Cagney saw the 16 July 1945 issue of Life magazine depicting Murphy as the \\"most decorated soldier\\",[86] he brought him to Hollywood. Cagney and his brother William signed him as a contract player for their production company and gave him training in acting, voice and dance. They never cast Murphy in a movie and a personal disagreement ended the association in 1947.[116] Murphy later worked with acting coach Estelle Harman, and honed his diction by reciting dialogue from William Shakespeare and William Saroyan.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy moved into Terry Hunt's Athletic Club in Hollywood where he lived until 1948.[118][119] Hollywood writer David \\"Spec\\" McClure befriended Murphy, collaborating with him on Murphy's 1949 book To Hell and Back.[120] McClure used his connections to get Murphy a $500 (equivalent to $5,000 in 2017) bit part in Texas, Brooklyn and Heaven.[121] The agent of Wanda Hendrix, whom he had been dating since 1946,[122] got him a bit part in the 1948 Alan Ladd film Beyond Glory directed by John Farrow.[123] His 1949 film Bad Boy gave him his first leading role.[124] The film's financial backers refused to bankroll the project unless Murphy was given the lead;[125] thus, Allied Artists put aside their reservations about using an inexperienced actor and gave him the starring role.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nUniversal Studios signed Murphy to a seven-year studio contract at $2,500 a week (equivalent to $25,400 in 2017).[127][128] His first film for them was as Billy the Kid in The Kid from Texas in 1950. He wrapped up that year making Sierra starring Wanda Hendrix, who by that time had become his wife,[129] and Kansas Raiders as outlaw Jesse James. Universal lent him to MGM in 1951 at a salary of $25,000[130] to play the lead of The Youth[ALM 6] in The Red Badge of Courage, directed by John Huston.[132] Murphy and Huston worked together again in the 1960 film The Unforgiven.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only film Murphy made in 1952 was The Duel at Silver Creek with director Don Siegel. Murphy worked with Siegel one more time in 1958 for The Gun Runners. In 1953, he starred in Frederick de Cordova's Column South,[134] and played Jim Harvey in Nathan Juran's Tumbleweed, an adaptation of the Kenneth Perkins novel Three Were Renegades.[135][136] Director Nathan Juran also directed Gunsmoke and Drums Across the River.[137] George Marshall directed Murphy in the 1954 Destry, a remake of Destry Rides Again, based on a character created by author Max Brand.[138]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Murphy was initially reluctant to appear as himself in To Hell and Back, the 1955 adaptation of his book directed by Jesse Hibbs, he eventually agreed;[139] it became the biggest hit in the history of Universal Studios at the time.[140][141] To help publicize the release of the film, he made guest appearances on television shows such as What's My Line?,[ALM 7] Toast of the Town,[142] and Colgate Comedy Hour.[ALM 8] The Hibbs-Murphy team proved so successful in To Hell and Back[143] that the two worked together on five subsequent films. The partnership resulted in the 1956 western Walk the Proud Land,[144] and the non-westerns Joe Butterfly[145] and World in My Corner. They worked together for the last time in the 1958 western Ride a Crooked Trail.[146]\\r\\n\\r\\nJoseph L. Mankiewicz hired Murphy to play the titular role[ALM 9] in the 1958 film The Quiet American.[148] Murphy formed a partnership with Harry Joe Brown to make three films, starting with The Guns of Fort Petticoat (1957). The partnership fell into disagreement over the remaining two projects, and Brown filed suit against Murphy.[149]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy was featured in three westerns in 1959: he starred opposite Sandra Dee in The Wild and the Innocent,[150] collaborated as an uncredited co-producer with Walter Mirisch on the black and white Cast a Long Shadow, and performed as a hired killer in No Name on the Bullet, a film that was well received by critics.[151] Thelma Ritter was his costar in the 1960 Startime television episode \\"The Man\\".[152] During the early 1960s, Murphy donated his time and otherwise lent his name and image for three episodes of The Big Picture television series produced by the United States Army. He received the 1960 Outstanding Civilian Service Medal for his cooperation in the episode Broken Bridge, which featured his visits to military installations in Germany, Italy, Turkey and the U.S. state of New Mexico to showcase the military's latest weaponry.[153][154]\\r\\n\\r\\nWriter Clair Huffaker wrote the 1961 screenplays for Murphy's films Seven Ways from Sundown and Posse from Hell.[155] Willard W. Willingham and his wife Mary Willingham befriended Murphy in his early days in Hollywood and worked with him on a number of projects.[156][157][158]\\r\\n\\r\\nWillard was a producer on Murphy's 1961 television series Whispering Smith,[159] and co-wrote the screenplay for Battle at Bloody Beach that year.[160] He collaborated on Bullet for a Badman[161] in 1964 and Arizona Raiders in 1965.[162] The Willinghams as a team wrote the screenplay for Gunpoint[163] as well as the script for Murphy's last starring lead in the western 40 Guns to Apache Pass in 1967.[164] Murphy made Trunk to Cairo in Israel in 1966.[165]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe first met director Budd Boetticher when Murphy requested to be his boxing partner at Terry Hunt's Athletic Club.[166] He subsequently appeared in the 1951 title role of Boetticher's first western The Cimarron Kid.[167] Boetticher wrote the script in 1969 for Murphy's last film, A Time for Dying.[168] Two other projects that Murphy and Boetticher planned to collaborate on?ÿ A Horse for Mr Barnum and When There's Sumpthin' to Do?ÿ never came to fruition.[169]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy married actress Wanda Hendrix in 1949.[170] Their divorce became final two years later in 1951.[171] Four days later, he married former airline stewardess Pamela Opal Lee Archer (October 7, 1923 - April 8, 2010), with whom[172] he had two sons: Terry Michael (born 14 March 1952),[173][174] and James Shannon (born 1954).[175]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy bred quarter horses at the Audie Murphy Ranch in what is now Menifee, California, and the Murphy Ranch in Pima County, Arizona.[ALM 10]\\r\\nHis horses raced at the Del Mar Racetrack, and he invested large sums of money in the hobby.[178] Murphy's gambling left his finances in a poor state. In 1968 he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes.[179] In spite of his financial difficulties, Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes, mindful of the influence he would have on the youth market.[180]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 28 May 1971, Murphy was killed when the private plane in which he was a passenger crashed into Brush Mountain, near Catawba, Virginia, 20 miles (32?km) west of Roanoke in conditions of rain, clouds, fog and zero visibility.[181] The pilot and four other passengers were also killed.[182]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aircraft was a twin-engine Aero Commander 680 flown by a pilot who had a private-pilot license and a reported 8,000 hours of flying time, but who held no instrument rating. The aircraft was recovered on 31 May.[183] After her husband's death, Pamela Murphy moved into a small apartment and got a clerk position at the Sepulveda Veterans Administration Hospital in Los Angeles, where she remained employed for 35 years.[184]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1975, a court awarded Murphy's widow and two children $2.5 million in damages because of the accident.[185]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 June 1971, Murphy was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.[186] In attendance were Ambassador to the U.N. George H.W. Bush, Army Chief of Staff William Westmoreland, and many of the 3rd Infantry Division.[187] Murphy's gravesite is in Section 46, headstone number 46-366-11, located across Memorial Drive from the Amphitheater. A special flagstone walkway was later constructed to accommodate the large number of people who visit to pay their respects. It is the cemetery's second most-visited gravesite, after that of President John F. Kennedy.[188]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe headstones of Medal of Honor recipients buried at Arlington National Cemetery are normally decorated in gold leaf. Murphy previously requested that his stone remain plain and inconspicuous, like that of an ordinary soldier.[189] The headstone contains the birth year 1924, based upon purportedly falsified materials among his military records.[190] In 1974, a large granite marker was erected just off the Appalachian Trail at 372152N 801333W? / ?37.364554N 80.225748W? / 37.364554; -80.225748? (Audie Murphy monument) at 3,100 elevation, near the crash site.[191]\\r\\n\\r\\nCivilian honors were bestowed on Murphy during his lifetime and posthumously, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[192] In 2013, Murphy was honored by his home state with the Texas Legislative Medal of Honor.[ALM 11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwedish power metal band Sabaton wrote a song on their 2014 studio album, Heroes, also entitled \\"To Hell and Back\\", commemorating and recognizing Audie Murphy as one of the most decorated American veterans of World War II.[197]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid McClure, his collaborator on the book To Hell and Back, discovered Murphy's talent for poetry during their work on the memoir when he found discarded verses in Murphy's Hollywood apartment. One of those poems, \\"The Crosses Grow on Anzio\\", appears in To Hell and Back attributed to a soldier named Kerrigan. Only two others survived, \\"Alone and Far Removed\\" and \\"Freedom Flies in Your Heart Like an Eagle\\". The latter was part of a speech Murphy had written at a 1968 dedication of the Alabama War Memorial in Montgomery, and later set to music by Scott Turner under the title \\"Dusty Old Helmet\\".[198]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy was a fan of country music, in particular Bob Wills and Chet Atkins, but was not a singer or musician himself.[199] Through his friend Guy Mitchell, Murphy was introduced to songwriter Scott Turner in 1961.[200][201] The two collaborated on numerous songs between 1962 and 1970, the most successful of which was \\"Shutters and Boards\\" and \\"When the Wind Blows in Chicago\\".[202]","input":"Who was the most decorated american soldier in world war ii?"},{"output":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","context":"","input":"What is first book in harry potter series?"},{"output":"St Peter","context":"This chronological list of popes corresponds to that given in the Annuario Pontificio under the heading \\"I Sommi Pontefici Romani\\" (The Supreme Pontiffs of Rome), excluding those that are explicitly indicated as antipopes. Published every year by the Roman Curia, the Annuario Pontificio attaches no consecutive numbers to the popes, stating that it is impossible to decide which side represented at various times the legitimate succession, in particular regarding Pope Leo VIII, Pope Benedict V and some mid-11th-century popes.[1] The 2001 edition of the Annuario Pontificio introduced \\"almost 200 corrections to its existing biographies of the popes, from St Peter to John Paul II\\". The corrections concerned dates, especially in the first two centuries, birthplaces and the family name of one pope.[2]\\r\\nThe term pope (Latin: papa \\"father\\") is used in several Churches to denote their high spiritual leaders (for example Coptic Pope). This title in English usage usually refers to the head of the Catholic Church. The Catholic pope uses various titles by tradition, including Summus Pontifex, Pontifex Maximus, and Servus servorum Dei. Each title has been added by unique historical events and unlike other papal prerogatives, is not incapable of modification.[3]\\r\\nHermannus Contractus may have been the first historian to number the popes continuously. His list ends in 1049 with Pope Leo IX as number 154. Several changes were made to the list during the 20th century. Antipope Christopher was considered legitimate for a long time. Pope-elect Stephen was considered legitimate under the name Stephen II until the 1961 edition, when his name was erased. Although these changes are no longer controversial, a number of modern lists still include this \\"first Pope Stephen II\\". It is probable that this is because they are based on the 1913 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia, which is in the public domain.\\r\\nA significant number of these popes have been recognized as saints, including 48 out of the first 50 consecutive popes, and others are in the sainthood process.

The vessel was the first submarine to complete a submerged transit of the North Pole on 3rd August 1958.\\r\\nSharing names with Captain Nemo's fictional submarine in Jules Verne's classic 1870 science fiction novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, and named after another USS?Nautilus?(SS-168) that served with distinction in World War II, the new atomic powered Nautilus was authorized in 1951, with laying down for construction in 1952 and launched in January 1954, attended by Mamie Eisenhower, First Lady of the United States, wife of 34th President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and commissioned the following September into the United States Navy. Final construction was completed in 1955.\\r\\nBecause her nuclear propulsion allowed her to remain submerged far longer than the then current diesel-electric submarines previously, she broke many records in her first years of operation, and traveled to locations previously beyond the limits of submarines. In operation, she revealed a number of limitations in her design and construction. This information was used to improve subsequent submarines.\\r\\nNautilus was decommissioned in 1980 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1982. The submarine has been preserved as a museum ship at the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut, where the vessel receives around 250,000 visitors per year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 1951 the United States Congress authorized the construction of a nuclear-powered submarine for the U.S. Navy, which was planned and personally supervised by Captain (later Admiral) Hyman G. Rickover, USN, known as the \\"Father of the Nuclear Navy.\\"[6] On 12 December 1951 the US Department of the Navy announced that the submarine would be called Nautilus, the fourth U.S. Navy vessel officially so named. The boat carried the hull number SSN-571.[1] The Nautilus benefited from the GUPPY improvements to the American Gato-, Balao-, and Tench-class submarines.[citation needed]\\r\\nNautilus's keel was laid at General Dynamics' Electric Boat Division in Groton, Connecticut by Harry S. Truman on 14 June 1952.[7] She was christened on 21 January 1954 and launched into the Thames River, sponsored by Mamie Eisenhower. Nautilus was commissioned on 30 September 1954, under the command of Commander Eugene P. Wilkinson, USN.[1]\\r\\nNautilus was powered by the Submarine Thermal Reactor (STR), later redesignated the S2W reactor, a pressurized water reactor produced for the US Navy by Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory, operated by Westinghouse, developed the basic reactor plant design used in Nautilus after being given the assignment on 31 December 1947 to design a nuclear power plant for a submarine.[8] Nuclear power had the crucial advantage in submarine propulsion because it is a zero-emission process that consumes no air. This design is the basis for nearly all of the US nuclear-powered submarine and surface combat ships, and was adapted by other countries for naval nuclear propulsion. The first actual prototype (for Nautilus) was constructed and tested by the Argonne National Laboratory in 1953 at the S1W facility, part of the National Reactor Testing Station in Idaho.[9][10]\\r\\nNautilus' ship's patch was designed by The Walt Disney Company, and her wardroom currently displays a set of tableware made of zirconium, as the reactor core was partly made of zirconium.\\r\\nFollowing her commissioning, Nautilus remained dockside for further construction and testing. On the morning of January 17, 1955, at 11 am EST, Nautilus' first Commanding Officer, Commander Eugene P. Wilkinson, ordered all lines cast off and signaled the memorable and historic message, \\"Underway On Nuclear Power.\\" [11] On 10 May, she headed south for shakedown. Submerged throughout, she traveled 1,100 nautical miles (2,000?km; 1,300?mi) from New London to San Juan, Puerto Rico and covered 1,200 nautical miles (2,200?km; 1,400?mi) in less than ninety hours. At the time, this was the longest submerged cruise by a submarine and at the highest sustained speed (for at least one hour) ever recorded.\\r\\nFrom 1955 to 1957, Nautilus continued to be used to investigate the effects of increased submerged speeds and endurance. The improvements rendered the progress made in anti-submarine warfare during World War II virtually obsolete. Radar and anti-submarine aircraft, which had proved crucial in defeating submarines during the war, proved ineffective against a vessel able to move quickly out of an area, change depth quickly and stay submerged for very long periods.[12]\\r\\nOn 4 February 1957, Nautilus logged her 60,000th nautical mile (110,000?km; 69,000?mi), matching the endurance of her namesake, the fictional Nautilus described in Jules Verne's novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea.[13] In May, she departed for the Pacific Coast to participate in coastal exercises and the fleet exercise, operation \\"Home Run,\\" which acquainted units of the Pacific Fleet with the capabilities of nuclear submarines.\\r\\nNautilus returned to New London, Connecticut, on 21 July and departed again on 19 August for her first voyage of 1,200 nautical miles (2,200?km; 1,400?mi) under polar pack ice. Thereafter, she headed for the Eastern Atlantic to participate in NATO exercises and conduct a tour of various British and French ports where she was inspected by defense personnel of those countries. She arrived back at New London on 28 October, underwent upkeep, and then conducted coastal operations until the spring.\\r\\nIn response to the nuclear ICBM threat posed by Sputnik, President Eisenhower ordered the U.S. Navy to attempt a submarine transit of the North Pole to gain credibility for the soon-to-come SLBM weapons system.[14] On 25 April 1958, Nautilus was underway again for the West Coast, now commanded by Commander William R. Anderson, USN. Stopping at San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle, she began her history-making polar transit, operation \\"Sunshine\\", as she departed the latter port on 9 June. On 19 June she entered the Chukchi Sea, but was turned back by deep drift ice in those shallow waters. On 28 June she arrived at Pearl Harbor to await better ice conditions.\\r\\nBy 23 July 1958 her wait was over, and she set a course northward.[15] She submerged in the Barrow Sea Valley on 1 August and on 3 August, at 2315 (EDT) she became the first watercraft to reach the geographic North Pole.[16] The ability to navigate at extreme latitudes and without surfacing was enabled by the technology of the North American Aviation N6A-1 Inertial Navigation System, a naval modification of the N6A used in the Navaho cruise missile; it had been installed on Nautilus and Skate after initial sea trials on USS?Compass Island in 1957.[17] From the North Pole, she continued on and after 96 hours and 1,590 nautical miles (2,940?km; 1,830?mi) under the ice, surfaced northeast of Greenland, having completed the first successful submerged voyage around the North Pole. The technical details of this mission were planned by scientists from the Naval Electronics Laboratory including Dr. Waldo Lyon who accompanied Nautilus as chief scientist and ice pilot.\\r\\nNavigation beneath the arctic ice sheet was difficult. Above 85N both magnetic compasses and normal gyrocompasses become inaccurate. A special gyrocompass built by Sperry Rand was installed shortly before the journey. There was a risk that the submarine would become disoriented beneath the ice and that the crew would have to play \\"longitude roulette\\". Commander Anderson had considered using torpedoes to blow a hole in the ice if the submarine needed to surface.[18]\\r\\nThe most difficult part of the journey was in the Bering Strait. The ice extended as much as 60 feet (18?m) below sea level. During the initial attempt to go through the Bering Strait, there was insufficient room between the ice and the sea bottom. During the second, successful attempt to pass through the Bering passage, the submarine passed through a known channel close to Alaska (this was not the first choice, as the submarine wanted to avoid detection).\\r\\nThe trip beneath the ice cap was an important boost to America as the Soviets had recently launched Sputnik, but had no nuclear submarine of their own. During the address announcing the journey, the president mentioned that one day nuclear cargo submarines might use that route for trade.[19]\\r\\nAs Nautilus proceeded south from Greenland, a helicopter airlifted Commander Anderson to connect with transport to Washington, D.C. At a White House ceremony on 8 August, President Eisenhower presented him with the Legion of Merit and announced that the crew had earned a Presidential Unit Citation.[20]\\r\\nAt her next port of call, the Isle of Portland, England, she received the Unit Citation, the first ever issued in peace time, from American Ambassador JH Whitney, and then crossed the Atlantic reaching New London, Connecticut on 29 October. For the remainder of the year Nautilus operated from her home port of New London.\\r\\nFollowing fleet exercises in early 1959, Nautilus entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, for her first complete overhaul (28 May 1959 ÿ 15 August 1960). Overhaul was followed by refresher training and on 24 October she departed New London for her first deployment with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, returning to her home-port 16 December.\\r\\nNautilus spent most of her career assigned to SubRon Ten (Submarine Squadron Ten) at State Pier in New London, Connecticut. The squadron commander was stationed aboard USS?Fulton, a submarine tender also stationed at State Pier. Nautilus and other submarines in the squadron made their home tied up alongside the tender, where they received preventive maintenance and, if necessary, repairs, from the well-equipped Fulton and her crew of machinists, millwrights, and other craftsmen.\\r\\nNautilus operated in the Atlantic, conducting evaluation tests for ASW improvements, participating in NATO exercises and, during October 1962, in the naval quarantine of Cuba, until she headed east again for a two-month Mediterranean tour in August 1963. On her return she joined in fleet exercises until entering the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for her second overhaul 17 January 1964.\\r\\nOn 2 May 1966, Nautilus returned to her homeport to resume operations with the Atlantic Fleet, and at some point around that month, logged her 300,000th nautical mile (560,000?km; 350,000?mi) underway. For the next year and a quarter she conducted special operations for ComSubLant and then in August 1967, returned to Portsmouth, for another year's stay. During an exercise in 1966 she collided with the aircraft carrier USS?Essex on 10 November, while diving shallow.[21] Following repairs in Portsmouth she conducted exercises off the southeastern seaboard. She returned to New London in December 1968 and operated as a unit of Submarine Squadron 10 for most of the remainder of her career.\\r\\nOn 9 April 1979, Nautilus set out from Groton, Connecticut on her final voyage under the command of Richard A. Riddell.[22] She reached Mare Island Naval Shipyard of Vallejo, California on 26 May 1979, her last day underway. She was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 3 March 1980.\\r\\nToward the end of its service, the hull and sail of Nautilus vibrated sufficiently that sonar became ineffective at more than 4 knots (7.4?km/h; 4.6?mph) speed.[23] As noise generation is extremely undesirable in submarines, this made the vessel vulnerable to detection. Lessons learned from this problem were applied to later nuclear submarines.[24]\\r\\nFor outstanding achievement in completing the first voyage in history across the top of the world, by cruising under the Arctic ice cap from the Bering Strait to the Greenland Sea.\\r\\nDuring the period 22 July 1958 to 5 August 1958, USS Nautilus, the world's first atomic powered ship, added to her list of historic achievements by crossing the Arctic Ocean from the Bering Sea to the Greenland Sea, passing submerged beneath the geographic North Pole. This voyage opens the possibility of a new commercial seaway, a Northwest Passage, between the major oceans of the world. Nuclear-powered cargo submarines may, in the future, use this route to the advantage of world trade.\\r\\nThe skill, professional competency and courage of the officers and crew of Nautilus were in keeping with the highest traditions of the Armed Forces of the United States and the pioneering spirit which has always characterized our country.[25]\\r\\nTo commemorate the first submerged voyage under the North Pole, all Nautilus crewmembers who made the voyage may wear a Presidential Unit Citation ribbon with a special clasp in the form of a gold block letter N (image above).[26]\\r\\nNautilus was designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Secretary of the Interior on 20 May 1982.[5][27]\\r\\nShe was named as the official state ship of Connecticut in 1983.[28] Following an extensive conversion at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Nautilus was towed back to Groton, Connecticut, under the command of Captain John Almon, arriving on 6 July 1985. On 11 April 1986, Nautilus opened to the public as part of the Submarine Force Library and Museum.[16]\\r\\nNautilus now serves as a museum of submarine history operated by the Naval History and Heritage Command. The ship underwent a five-month preservation in 2002 at the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics, at a cost of approximately $4.7 million ($6.26?million in present-day terms[29]). Nautilus attracts some 250,000 visitors annually to her present berth near Naval Submarine Base New London.\\r\\nNautilus celebrated the 50th anniversary of her commissioning on 30 September 2004 with a ceremony that included a speech from Vice Admiral Eugene P Wilkinson, the first Commanding Officer of Nautilus, and a designation of the ship as an American Nuclear Society National Nuclear Landmark.\\r\\nVisitors may tour the forward two compartments, with guidance from an automated system.

The Raiders franchise was founded in Oakland, California in 1959 and became the eighth member of the American Football League (AFL) in 1960 as a replacement for the Minnesota Vikings, who had moved to the NFL. The Raiders joined the NFL in 1970, after the AFLÿNFL merger. They played in Los Angeles between 1982 and 1995, before returning to Oakland.[1] As of the end of the 2015 season, the Raiders have played 852 games in a total of 56 seasons in the AFL and NFL.[2] In those games, two coaches have won the Super Bowl with the team: John Madden in 1976 and Tom Flores in 1980 and 1983. One coach, John Rauch in 1966, won the AFL Championship.[3] Three other coaches, Art Shell, Jon Gruden and Bill Callahan, have also taken the Raiders to the playoffs.[4] Callahan led the Raiders to the Super Bowl. He did this in his first year as head coach of the team.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nShell and Gruden are the only coaches to have more than one tenure with the team, and Flores and Shell are the only coaches to have coached the team in both Oakland and Los Angeles.

Adler(/??dl?r/;[1] German: [?a?dl?]; 7 February 1870 ÿ 28 May 1937) was an Austrian medical doctor, psychotherapist, and founder of the school of individual psychology.[2] His emphasis on the importance of feelings of inferiority,[3] the inferiority complex, is recognized as an isolating element which plays a key role in personality development.[4] Alfred Adler considered human beings as an individual whole, therefore he called his psychology \\"Individual Psychology\\" (Orgler 1976).\\r\\nAdler was the first to emphasize the importance of the social element in the re-adjustment process of the individual and who carried psychiatry into the community.[5] A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Adler as the 67th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlfred Adler was born at Mariahilfer Stra?e 208[7] in Rudolfsheim, then a village on the western fringes of Vienna, and today part of Rudolfsheim-Fnfhaus, the 15th district of the city. He was second of the seven children of a Hungarian-born, Jewish grain merchant and his wife.[8][9] Alfred's younger brother died in the bed next to him, when Alfred was only three years old.[10] Alfred was an active, popular child and an average student who was also known for his competitive attitude toward his older brother, Sigmund.\\r\\nEarly on, he developed rickets, which kept him from walking until he was four years old. At the age of four, he developed pneumonia and heard a doctor say to his father, \\"Your boy is lost\\". At that point, he decided to be a physician.[11] He was very interested in the subjects of psychology, sociology and philosophy.[12] After studying at University of Vienna, he specialized as an eye doctor, and later in neurology and psychiatry.[12]\\r\\nAdler began his medical career as an ophthalmologist, but he soon switched to general practice, and established his office in a less affluent part of Vienna across from the Prater, a combination amusement park and circus. His clients included circus people, and it has been suggested[11] that the unusual strengths and weaknesses of the performers led to his insights into \\"organ inferiorities\\" and \\"compensation\\".\\r\\nIn 1902 Adler received an invitation from Sigmund Freud to join an informal discussion group that included Rudolf Reitler and Wilhelm Stekel. The group, the \\"Wednesday Society\\" (Mittwochsgesellschaft), met regularly on Wednesday evenings at Freud's home and was the beginning of the psychoanalytic movement, expanding over time to include many more members. A long-serving member of the group, Adler became president of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society eight years later (1910). He remained a member of the Society until 1911, when he and a group of his supporters formally disengaged from Freud's circle, the first of the great dissenters from orthodox psychoanalysis (preceding Carl Jung's split in 1914). This departure suited both Freud and Adler, since they had grown to dislike each other. During his association with Freud, Adler frequently maintained his own ideas which often diverged from Freud's. While Adler is often referred to as \\"a pupil of Freud's\\", in fact this was never true; they were colleagues, Freud referring to him in print in 1909 as \\"My colleague Dr Alfred Adler\\".[13] In 1929 Adler showed a reporter with the New York Herald a copy of the faded postcard that Freud had sent him in 1902. He wanted to prove that he had never been a disciple of Freud's but rather that Freud had sought him out to share his ideas.\\r\\nAdler founded the Society for Individual Psychology in 1912 after his break from the psychoanalytic movement. Adler's group initially included some orthodox Nietzschean adherents (who believed that Adler's ideas on power and inferiority were closer to Nietzsche than Freud's). Their enmity aside, Adler retained a lifelong admiration for Freud's ideas on dreams and credited him with creating a scientific approach to their clinical utilization (Fiebert, 1997). Nevertheless, even regarding dream interpretation, Adler had his own theoretical and clinical approach. The primary differences between Adler and Freud centered on Adler's contention that the social realm (exteriority) is as important to psychology as is the internal realm (interiority). The dynamics of power and compensation extend beyond sexuality, and gender and politics can be as important as libido. Moreover, Freud did not share Adler's socialist beliefs, the latter's wife being for example an intimate friend of many of the Russian Marxists such as Leon Trotsky.[14]\\r\\nFollowing Adler's break from Freud, he enjoyed considerable success and celebrity in building an independent school of psychotherapy and a unique personality theory. He traveled and lectured for a period of 25 years promoting his socially oriented approach. His intent was to build a movement that would rival, even supplant, others in psychology by arguing for the holistic integrity of psychological well-being with that of social equality. Adler's efforts were halted by World War I, during which he served as a doctor with the Austrian Army. After the conclusion of the war, his influence increased greatly. In the 1930s, he established a number of child guidance clinics. From 1921 onwards, he was a frequent lecturer in Europe and the United States, becoming a visiting professor at Columbia University in 1927. His clinical treatment methods for adults were aimed at uncovering the hidden purpose of symptoms using the therapeutic functions of insight and meaning.\\r\\nAdler was concerned with the overcoming of the superiority/inferiority dynamic and was one of the first psychotherapists to discard the analytic couch in favor of two chairs. This allows the clinician and patient to sit together more or less as equals. Clinically, Adler's methods are not limited to treatment after-the-fact but extend to the realm of prevention by preempting future problems in the child. Prevention strategies include encouraging and promoting social interest, belonging, and a cultural shift within families and communities that leads to the eradication of pampering and neglect (especially corporal punishment). Adler's popularity was related to the comparative optimism and comprehensibility of his ideas. He often wrote for the lay public. Adler always retained a pragmatic approach that was task-oriented. These \\"Life tasks\\" are occupation/work, society/friendship, and love/sexuality. Their success depends on cooperation. The tasks of life are not to be considered in isolation since, as Adler famously commented, \\"they all throw cross-lights on one another\\".[15]\\r\\nIn his bestselling book, Man's Search for Meaning, Dr. Viktor E. Frankl compared his own \\"Third Viennese School of Psychotherapy\\" (after Freud's and Adler's schools) to Adler's analysis:\\r\\nAccording to logotherapy, the striving to find a meaning in one's life is the primary motivational force in man. That is why I speak of a will to meaning in contrast to the \\"pleasure principle\\" (or, as we could also term it, the will to pleasure) on which Freudian psychoanalysis is centered, as well as in contrast to the will to power stressed by Adlerian psychology.[16]\\r\\nIn the early 1930s, after most of Adler's Austrian clinics had been closed due to his Jewish heritage (despite his conversion to Christianity), Adler left Austria for a professorship at the Long Island College of Medicine in the US. Adler died from a heart attack in 1937 in Aberdeen, Scotland, during a lecture tour, although his remains went missing and were unaccounted for until 2007.[17] His death was a temporary blow to the influence of his ideas, although a number of them were subsequently taken up by neo-Freudians. Through the work of Rudolf Dreikurs in the United States and many other adherents worldwide, Adlerian ideas and approaches remain strong and viable more than 70 years after Adler's death.\\r\\nAround the world there are various organizations promoting Adler's orientation towards mental and social well-being. These include the International Committee of Adlerian Summer Schools and Institutes (ICASSI), the North American Society for Adlerian Psychology (NASAP) and the International Association for Individual Psychology. Teaching institutes and programs exist in Austria, Canada, England, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Switzerland, the United States, Jamaica, Peru, and Wales.\\r\\nAdler was influenced by the mental construct ideas of the philosopher Hans Vaihinger (The Philosophy of 'As if') and the literature of Dostoyevsky. While still a member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society he developed a theory of organic inferiority and compensation that was the prototype for his later turn to phenomenology and the development of his famous concept, the inferiority complex.\\r\\nAdler was also influenced by the philosophies of Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche, Rudolf Virchow and the statesman Jan Smuts (who coined the term \\"holism\\"). Adler's School, known as \\"Individual Psychology\\"an arcane reference to the Latin individuus meaning indivisibility, a term intended to emphasize holismis both a social and community psychology as well as a depth psychology. Adler was an early advocate in psychology for prevention and emphasized the training of parents, teachers, social workers and so on in democratic approaches that allow a child to exercise their power through reasoned decision making whilst co-operating with others. He was a social idealist, and was known as a socialist in his early years of association with psychoanalysis (1902ÿ1911).[18]\\r\\nAdler was pragmatic and believed that lay people could make practical use of the insights of psychology. Adler was also an early supporter of feminism in psychology and the social world, believing that feelings of superiority and inferiority were often gendered and expressed symptomatically in characteristic masculine and feminine styles. These styles could form the basis of psychic compensation and lead to mental health difficulties. Adler also spoke of \\"safeguarding tendencies\\" and neurotic behavior[19] long before Anna Freud wrote about the same phenomena in her book The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense.\\r\\nAdlerian-based scholarly, clinical and social practices focus on the following topics:[citation needed]\\r\\nFrom its inception, Adlerian psychology has included both professional and lay adherents. Adler felt that all people could make use of the scientific insights garnered by psychology and he welcomed everyone, from decorated academics to those with no formal education to participate in spreading the principles of Adlerian psychology.[citation needed]\\r\\nAdler's book, ber den nerv?sen Charakter (The Neurotic Character) defines his earlier key ideas. He argued that human personality could be explained teleologically: parts of the individual's unconscious self ideally work to convert feelings of inferiority to superiority (or rather completeness).[20] The desires of the self ideal were countered by social and ethical demands. If the corrective factors were disregarded and the individual overcompensated, then an inferiority complex would occur, fostering the danger of the individual becoming egocentric, power-hungry and aggressive or worse.[21]\\r\\nCommon therapeutic tools include the use of humor, historical instances, and paradoxical injunctions.[22]\\r\\nAdler maintained that human psychology is psychodynamic in nature. Unlike Freud's metapsychology that emphasizes instinctual demands, human psychology is guided by goals and fueled by a yet unknown creative force. Like Freud's instincts, Adler's fictive goals are largely unconscious. These goals have a \\"teleological\\" function.[23] Constructivist Adlerians, influenced by neo-Kantian and Nietzschean ideas, view these \\"teleological\\" goals as \\"fictions\\" in the sense that Hans Vaihinger spoke of (fictio). Usually there is a fictional final goal which can be deciphered alongside of innumerable sub-goals. The inferiority/superiority dynamic is constantly at work through various forms of compensation and overcompensation. For example, in anorexia nervosa the fictive final goal is to \\"be perfectly thin\\" (overcompensation on the basis of a feeling of inferiority). Hence, the fictive final goal can serve a persecutory function that is ever-present in subjectivity (though its trace springs are usually unconscious). The end goal of being \\"thin\\" is fictive however since it can never be subjectively achieved.\\r\\nTeleology serves another vital function for Adlerians. Chilon's \\"hora telos\\" (\\"see the end, consider the consequences\\") provides for both healthy and maladaptive psychodynamics. Here we also find Adler's emphasis on personal responsibility in mentally healthy subjects who seek their own and the social good.\\r\\nThe metaphysical thread of Adlerian theory does not problematise the notion of teleology since concepts such as eternity (an ungraspable end where time ceases to exist) match the religious aspects that are held in tandem. In contrast, the constructivist Adlerian threads (either humanist/modernist or postmodern in variant) seek to raise insight of the force of unconscious fictionsÿ which carry all of the inevitability of 'fate'ÿ so long as one does not understand them. Here, 'teleology' itself is fictive yet experienced as quite real. This aspect of Adler's theory is somewhat analogous to the principles developed in Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and Cognitive Therapy (CT). Both Albert Ellis and Aaron T. Beck credit Adler as a major precursor to REBT and CT. Ellis in particular was a member of the North American Society for Adlerian Psychology and served as an editorial board member for the Adlerian Journal Individual Psychology.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs a psychodynamic system, Adlerians excavate the past of a client/patient in order to alter their future and increase integration into community in the 'here-and-now'.[24] The 'here-and-now' aspects are especially relevant to those Adlerians who emphasize humanism and/or existentialism in their approaches.\\r\\nMetaphysical Adlerians emphasise a spiritual holism in keeping with what Jan Smuts articulated (Smuts coined the term \\"holism\\"), that is, the spiritual sense of one-ness that holism usually implies (etymology of holism: from ?? holos, a Greek word meaning all, entire, total) Smuts believed that evolution involves a progressive series of lesser wholes integrating into larger ones. Whilst Smuts' text Holism and Evolution is thought to be a work of science, it actually attempts to unify evolution with a higher metaphysical principle (holism). The sense of connection and one-ness revered in various religious traditions (among these, Baha'i, Christianity, Judaism, Islam and Buddhism) finds a strong complement in Adler's thought.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe pragmatic and materialist aspects to contextualizing members of communities, the construction of communities and the socio-historical-political forces that shape communities matter a great deal when it comes to understanding an individual's psychological make-up and functioning. This aspect of Adlerian psychology holds a high level of synergy with the field of community psychology, especially given Adler's concern for what he called \\"the absolute truth and logic of communal life\\".[25] However, Adlerian psychology, unlike community psychology, is holistically concerned with both prevention and clinical treatment after-the-fact. Hence, Adler can be considered the \\"first community psychologist\\", a discourse that formalized in the decades following Adler's death (King & Shelley, 2008).\\r\\nAdlerian psychology, Carl Jung's analytical psychology, Gestalt therapy and Karen Horney's psychodynamic approach are holistic schools of psychology. These discourses eschew a reductive approach to understanding human psychology and psychopathology.[citation needed]\\r\\nAdler developed a scheme of so-called personality types, which were however always to be taken as provisional or heuristic since he did not, in essence, believe in personality types, and at different times proposed different and equally tentative systems.[26] The danger with typology is to lose sight of the individual's uniqueness and to gaze reductively, acts that Adler opposed. Nevertheless, he intended to illustrate patterns that could denote a characteristic governed under the overall style of life. Hence American Adlerians such as Harold Mosak have made use of Adler's typology in this provisional sense:[27]\\r\\nThese 'types' are typically formed in childhood and are expressions of the Style of Life.\\r\\nAdler placed great emphasis upon the interpretation of early memories in working with patients and school children, writing that, \\"Among all psychic expressions, some of the most revealing are the individual's memories.\\"[28] Adler viewed memories as expressions of \\"private logic\\" and as metaphors for an individual's personal philosophy of life or \\"lifestyle\\". He maintained that memories are never incidental or trivial; rather, they are chosen reminders: \\"(A person's) memories are the reminders she carries about with her of her limitations and of the meanings of events. There are no 'chance' memories. Out of the incalculable number of impressions that an individual receives, she chooses to remember only those which she considers, however dimly, to have a bearing on her problems.\\"[29]\\r\\nAdler often emphasized one's birth order as having an influence on the style of life and the strengths and weaknesses in one's psychological make up.[30] Birth order referred to the placement of siblings within the family. Adler believed that the firstborn child would be in a favorable position, enjoying the full attention of the eager new parents until the arrival of a second child. This second child would cause the first born to suffer feelings of dethronement, no longer being the center of attention. Adler (1908) believed that in a three-child family, the oldest child would be the most likely to suffer from neuroticism and substance addiction which he reasoned was a compensation for the feelings of excessive responsibility \\"the weight of the world on one's shoulders\\" (e.g. having to look after the younger ones) and the melancholic loss of that once supremely pampered position. As a result, he predicted that this child was the most likely to end up in jail or an asylum. Youngest children would tend to be overindulged, leading to poor social empathy. Consequently, the middle child, who would experience neither dethronement nor overindulgence, was most likely to develop into a successful individual yet also most likely to be a rebel and to feel squeezed-out. Adler himself was the third (some sources credit second) in a family of six children.\\r\\nAdler never produced any scientific support for his interpretations on birth order roles, nor did he feel the need to. Yet the value of the hypothesis was to extend the importance of siblings in marking the psychology of the individual beyond Freud's more limited emphasis on the mother and father. Hence, Adlerians spend time therapeutically mapping the influence that siblings (or lack thereof) had on the psychology of their clients. The idiographic approach entails an excavation of the phenomenology of one's birth order position for likely influence on the subject's Style of Life. In sum, the subjective experiences of sibling positionality and inter-relations are psychodynamically important for Adlerian therapists and personality theorists, not the cookbook predictions that may or may not have been objectively true in Adler's time.\\r\\nFor Adler, birth order answered the question, \\"Why do children, who are raised in the same family, grow up with very different personalities?\\" While a strict geneticist, believing siblings are raised in a shared environment, may claim any differences in personality would be caused by subtle variations in the individuals' genetics, Adler showed through his birth order theory that children do not grow up in the same shared environment, but the oldest child grows up in a family where they have younger siblings, the middle child with older and younger siblings, and the youngest with older siblings. The position in the family constellation, Adler said, is the reason for these differences in personality and not genetics: a point later taken up by Eric Berne.[31]\\r\\nAdler's insight into birth order, compensation and issues relating to the individuals' perception of community also led him to investigate the causes and treatment of substance abuse disorders, particularly alcoholism and morphinism, which already were serious social problems of his time. Adler's work with addicts was significant since most other prominent proponents of psychoanalysis invested relatively little time and thought into this widespread ill of the modern and post-modern age. In addition to applying his individual psychology approach of organ inferiority, for example, to the onset and causes of addictive behaviours, he also tried to find a clear relationship of drug cravings to sexual gratification or their substitutions. Early pharmaco-therapeutic interventions with non-addictive substances, such as neuphyllin were used, since withdrawal symptoms were explained by a form of \\"water-poisoning\\" that made the use of diuretics necessary. Adler and his wife's pragmatic approach, and the seemingly high success rates of their treatment were based on their ideas of social functioning and well-being. Clearly, life style choices and situations were emphasized, for example the need for relaxation or the negative effects of early childhood conflicts were examined, which compared to other authoritarian or religious treatment regimens, were clearly modern approaches. Certainly some of his observations, for example that psychopaths were more likely to be drug addicts are not compatible with current methodologies and theories of substance abuse treatment, but the self-centred attributes of the illness and the clear escapism from social responsibilities by pathological addicts put Adler's treatment modalities clearly into a modern contextual reasoning.[32]\\r\\nAdler's ideas regarding non-heterosexual sexuality and various social forms of deviance have long been controversial. Along with prostitution and criminality, Adler had classified 'homosexuals' as falling among the \\"failures of life\\". In 1917, he began his writings on homosexuality with a 52-page magazine, and sporadically published more thoughts throughout the rest of his life.\\r\\nThe Dutch psychologist Gerard J. M. van den Aardweg underlines how Alfred Adler came to his conclusions for, in 1917, Adler believed that he had established a connection between homosexuality and an inferiority complex towards one's own gender. This point of view differed from Freud's theory that homosexuality is rooted in narcissism or Jung's view of expressions of contrasexuality vis--vis the archetypes of the Anima and Animus.\\r\\nThere is evidence that Adler may have moved towards abandoning the hypothesis. Towards the end of Adler's life, in the mid-1930s, his opinion towards homosexuality began to shift. Elizabeth H. McDowell, a New York state family social worker recalls undertaking supervision with Adler on a young man who was \\"living in sin\\" with an older man in New York City. Adler asked her, \\"Is he happy, would you say?\\" \\"Oh yes,\\" McDowell replied. Adler then stated, \\"Well, why don't we leave him alone.\\"[33]\\r\\nAccording to Phyllis Bottome, who wrote Adler's Biography (after Adler himself laid upon her that task): \\"Homosexuality he always treated as lack of courage. These were but ways of obtaining a slight release for a physical need while avoiding a greater obligation. A transient partner of your own sex is a better known road and requires less courage than a permanent contact with an \\"unknown\\" sex. [...] Adler taught that men cannot be judged from within by their \\"possessions,\\" as he used to call nerves, glands, traumas, drives et cetera, since both judge and prisoner are liable to misconstrue what is invisible and incalculable; but that he can be judged, with no danger from introspection, by how he measures up to the three common life tasks set before every human being between the cradle and the grave. Work or employment, love or marriage, social contact.\\"[34]\\r\\nAdler emphasized both treatment and prevention. As a psychodynamic psychology, Adlerians emphasize the foundational importance of childhood in developing personality and any tendency towards various forms of psychopathology. The best way to inoculate against what are now termed \\"personality disorders\\" (what Adler had called the \\"neurotic character\\"), or a tendency to various neurotic conditions (depression, anxiety, etc.), is to train a child to be and feel an equal part of the family. The responsibility of the optimal development of the child is not limited to the Mother or Father but to teachers and society more broadly. Adler argued therefore that teachers, nurses, social workers, and so on require training in parent education to complement the work of the family in fostering a democratic character. When a child does not feel equal and is enacted upon (abused through pampering or neglect) they are likely to develop inferiority or superiority complexes and various accompanying compensation strategies.[35] These strategies exact a social toll by seeding higher divorce rates, the breakdown of the family, criminal tendencies, and subjective suffering in the various guises of psychopathology. Adlerians have long promoted parent education groups, especially those influenced by the famous Austrian/American Adlerian Rudolf Dreikurs (Dreikurs & Soltz, 1964).\\r\\nIn a late work, Social Interest: A Challenge to Mankind (1938), Adler turns to the subject of metaphysics, where he integrates Jan Smuts' evolutionary holism with the ideas of teleology and community: \\"sub specie aeternitatis\\". Unabashedly, he argues his vision of society: \\"Social feeling means above all a struggle for a communal form that must be thought of as eternally applicable... when humanity has attained its goal of perfection... an ideal society amongst all mankind, the ultimate fulfillment of evolution.\\"[36] Adler follows this pronouncement with a defense of metaphysics:\\r\\nI see no reason to be afraid of metaphysics; it has had a great influence on human life and development. We are not blessed with the possession of absolute truth; on that account we are compelled to form theories for ourselves about our future, about the results of our actions, etc. Our idea of social feeling as the final form of humanity - of an imagined state in which all the problems of life are solved and all our relations to the external world rightly adjusted - is a regulative ideal, a goal that gives our direction. This goal of perfection must bear within it the goal of an ideal community, because all that we value in life, all that endures and continues to endure, is eternally the product of this social feeling.[37]\\r\\nThis social feeling for Adler is Gemeinschaftsgefhl, a community feeling whereby one feels he or she belongs with others and has also developed an ecological connection with nature (plants, animals, the crust of this earth) and the cosmos as a whole, sub specie aeternitatis. Clearly, Adler himself had little problem with adopting a metaphysical and spiritual point of view to support his theories. Yet his overall theoretical yield provides ample room for the dialectical humanist (modernist) and the postmodernist to explain the significance of community and ecology through differing lenses (even if Adlerians have not fully considered how deeply divisive and contradictory these three threads of metaphysics, modernism, and post modernism are).\\r\\nAdler died suddenly in Aberdeen, Scotland, in May 1937, during a three-week visit to the University of Aberdeen. While walking down the street, he was seen to collapse and lie motionless on the pavement. As a man ran over to him and loosened his collar, Adler mumbled \\"Kurt\\", the name of his daughter and died. The autopsy performed determined his death was caused by a degeneration of the heart muscle.[38] His body was cremated at Warriston Crematorium in Edinburgh but the ashes were never reclaimed. In 2007, his ashes were rediscovered in a casket at Warriston Crematorium and returned to Vienna for burial in 2011.[39]\\r\\nMuch of Adlers theories have been absorbed into modern psychology without attribution. Psychohistorian Henri F. Ellenberger writes, It would not be easy to find another author from which so much has been borrowed on all sides without acknowledgement than Alfred Adler. Ellenberger posits several theories for the discrepancy between greatness of achievement, massive rejection of person and work, and wide-scale, quiet plagiarism These include Adlers imperfect style of writing and demeanor, his capacity to create a new obviousness, and his lack of a large and well organized following.[40]\\r\\nA prime modern example of use of Adlerian theory without attribution can be found in the work of American psychologist, Dr. Kevin Leman. Although himself a member of the North American Society of Adlerian Psychology, Lemans self-help book on early memory interpretation only cites Adler for coining the term, private logic, and neglects to mention that the entire premise for his (Leman's) bookthe theory and practice of early memory interpretationoriginates with Adlerian Individual Psychology.[41]\\r\\nIn collaboration with Sigmund Freud and a small group of Freud's colleagues, Adler was among the co-founders of the psychoanalytic movement and a core member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society: indeed, to Freud he was \\"the only personality there\\".[42] He was the first major figure to break away from psychoanalysis to form an independent school of psychotherapy and personality theory,[43] which he called individual psychology because he believed a human to be an indivisible whole, an individuum. He also imagined a person to be connected or associated with the surrounding world.[44]\\r\\nThis was after Freud declared Adler's ideas as too contrary, leading to an ultimatum to all members of the Society (which Freud had shepherded) to drop Adler or be expelled, disavowing the right to dissent (Makari, 2008). Nevertheless, Freud always took Adler's ideas seriously, calling them \\"... honorable errors. Though one rejects the content of Adler's views, one can recognize their consistency and significance\\".[45] Following this split, Adler would come to have an enormous, independent effect on the disciplines of counseling and psychotherapy as they developed over the course of the 20th century (Ellenberger, 1970). He influenced notable figures in subsequent schools of psychotherapy such as Rollo May, Viktor Frankl, Abraham Maslow and Albert Ellis.[46] His writings preceded, and were at times surprisingly consistent with, later neo-Freudian insights such as those evidenced in the works of Otto Rank, Karen Horney, Harry Stack Sullivan and Erich Fromm, some considering that it would take several decades for Freudian ego psychology to catch up with Adler's ground-breaking approach.[47]\\r\\nAdler emphasized the importance of equality in preventing various forms of psychopathology, and espoused the development of social interest and democratic family structures for raising children.[48] His most famous concept is the inferiority complex which speaks to the problem of self-esteem and its negative effects on human health (e.g. sometimes producing a paradoxical superiority striving). His emphasis on power dynamics is rooted in the philosophy of Nietzsche, whose works were published a few decades before Adler's. Specifically, Adler's conceptualization of the \\"Will to Power\\" focuses on the individual's creative power to change for the better.[49] Adler argued for holism, viewing the individual holistically rather than reductively, the latter being the dominant lens for viewing human psychology. Adler was also among the first in psychology to argue in favor of feminism, and the female analyst,[50] making the case that power dynamics between men and women (and associations with masculinity and femininity) are crucial to understanding human psychology (Connell, 1995). Adler is considered, along with Freud and Jung, to be one of the three founding figures of depth psychology, which emphasizes the unconscious and psychodynamics (Ellenberger, 1970; Ehrenwald, 1991); and thus to be one of the three great psychologists/philosophers of the twentieth century.[51]\\r\\nDuring his college years, he had become attached to a group of socialist students, among which he had found his wife-to-be, Raissa Timofeyewna Epstein, an intellectual and social activist from Russia studying in Vienna. They married in 1897 and had four children, two of whom became psychiatrists.[52] Their children were writer, psychiatrist and Socialist activist Alexandra Adler;[53] psychiatrist Kurt Adler;[54] writer and activist Valentine Adler;[55] and Cornelia \\"Nelly\\" Adler.[56]\\r\\nAuthor and journalist Margot Adler (1946-2014) was Adler's granddaughter.\\r\\nThe two main characters in the novel Plant Teacher engage in a session of Adlerian lifestyle interpretation, including early memory interpretation.[57]\\r\\nAlfred Adler's key publications were The Practice and Theory of Individual Psychology (1927), Understanding Human Nature (1927), & What Life Could Mean to You (1931). Other important publications are The Pattern of Life (1930), The Science of Living (1930), The Neurotic Constitution (1917), The Problems of Neurosis (1930). In his lifetime, Adler published more than 300 books and articles.\\r\\nThe Alfred Adler Institute of Northwestern Washington has recently published a twelve-volume set of The Collected Clinical Works of Alfred Adler, covering his writings from 1898-1937. An entirely new translation of Adler's magnum opus, The Neurotic Character, is featured in Volume 1. Volume 12 provides comprehensive overviews of Adler's mature theory and contemporary Adlerian practice.","input":"Austrian psychologist who founded the school of psychodynamic psychology?"},{"output":"a maximum of eleven","context":"Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport.[3][4][5][6] The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.\\r\\nPlayers are not allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play, unless they are goalkeepers (and then only when within their penalty area). Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use any part of their body except the hands and the arms. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French: Fdration Internationale de Football Association), which organises World Cups for both men and women every four years.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rules of association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863 and the name association football was coined to distinguish the game from the other forms of football played at the time, specifically rugby football. The first written \\"reference to the inflated ball used in the game\\" was in the mid-14th century: \\"Te heued fro te body went, Als it were a foteballe\\".[8] The Online Etymology Dictionary states that the word \\"soccer\\" was \\"split off in 1863\\".[9] According to Partha Mazumdar, the term soccer originated in England, first appearing in the 1880s as an Oxford \\"-er\\" abbreviation of the word \\"association\\".[10]\\r\\nWithin the English-speaking world, association football is now usually called football in the United Kingdom and mainly soccer in Canada and the United States. People in Australia, Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand use either or both terms, although national associations in Australia and New Zealand now primarily use \\"football\\" for the formal name.[11]\\r\\nAccording to FIFA, the Chinese competitive game cuju (, literally \\"kick ball\\") is the earliest form of football for which there is evidence.[13] Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was kicking a ball through an opening into a net. It was remarkably similar to modern football, though similarities to rugby occurred.[14][15] During the Han Dynasty (206 BC ÿ 220 AD), cuju games were standardised and rules were established.[14]\\r\\nPhaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games.[16][17] An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a vase at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens[12] appears on the UEFA European Championship Cup.[18] Athenaeus, writing in 228 AD, referenced the Roman ball game harpastum. Phaininda, episkyros and harpastum were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognizable as modern football.[14][19][20][21][22][23] As with pre-codified \\"mob football\\", the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking.[24][25] Non-competitive games included kemari in Japan,[26] chuk-guk in Korea and woggabaliri in Australia.\\r\\nAssociation football in itself does not have a classical history.[18] Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe.[27] The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England. The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century AD.[28]\\r\\nThe Cambridge Rules, first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857,[29] which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.[30]\\r\\nThese ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street, London.[31] The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse. The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from Blackheath, withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of Ebenezer Cobb Morley, went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game.[31] These rules included handling of the ball by \\"marks\\" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.[32]\\r\\nThe world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by C. W. Alcock and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The first official international football match also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock. England is also home to the world's first football league, which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor.[33] The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England.\\r\\nThe laws of the game are determined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).[34] The board was formed in 1886[35] after a meeting in Manchester of The Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales, and the Irish Football Association. FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association.[36] The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the International Football Association Board in 1913. The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.[37]\\r\\nToday, football is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams,[38] while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet.[39][40] A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football.[41] Football has the highest global television audience in sport.[42]\\r\\nIn many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans, local communities, and even nations. R. Kapuscinski says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games.[43] The C?te d'Ivoire national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006[44] and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouak, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time.[45] By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras.[46] The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.[47]\\r\\nWomen may have been playing \\"football\\" for as long as the game has existed. Evidence shows that an ancient version of the game (Tsu Chu) was played by women during the Han Dynasty (25ÿ220 CE). Two female figures are depicted in Han Dynasty (25ÿ220 CE) frescoes, playing Tsu Chu.[48] There are, however, a number of opinions about the accuracy of dates, the earliest estimates at 5000 BCE.[49]\\r\\nAssociation football, the modern game, also has documented early involvement of women. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too.[50][51] In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play.[52] The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow. In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895.[52][53]\\r\\nThe most well-documented early European team was founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, \\"I founded the association late last year [1894], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most.\\" [54] Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game.[55]\\r\\nWomen's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the First World War, when employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men fifty years earlier. The most successful team of the era was Dick, Kerr's Ladies of Preston, England. The team played in the first women's international matches in 1920, against a team from Paris, France, in April, and also made up most of the England team against a Scottish Ladies XI in 1920, and winning 22-0.[50]\\r\\nDespite being more popular than some men's football events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd),[56] women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, on the grounds that the game (as played by women) was distasteful.[57] Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted.[58] This led to the formation of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.[59]\\r\\nAssociation football has been played by women since at least the time of the first recorded women's games in the late 19th century.[60][61] It has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom.[61] In the late 1960s and early 1970s women's association football was organised in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the most prominent team sport for British women.[61]\\r\\nThe growth in women's football has seen major competitions being launched at both national and international level mirroring the male competitions. Women's football has faced many struggles. It had a \\"golden age\\" in the United Kingdom in the early 1920s when crowds reached 50,000 at some matches;[62] this was stopped on 5 December 1921 when England's Football Association voted to ban the game from grounds used by its member clubs. The FA's ban was rescinded in December 1969 with UEFA voting to officially recognise women's football in 1971.[61] The FIFA Women's World Cup was inaugurated in 1991 and has been held every four years since,[63] while women's football has been an Olympic event since 1996.\\r\\nAssociation football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The game is played using a spherical ball of 68ÿ70?cm (27ÿ28?in) circumference,[64] known as the football (or soccer ball). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent his or her team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.[65]\\r\\nThe primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a throw-in restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around they may use any part of their body (notably, \\"heading\\" with the forehead)[66] other than their hands or arms.[67] Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though the ball cannot be received in an offside position.[68]\\r\\nDuring gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.[69]\\r\\nAt a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the 2005ÿ06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match.[70] The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper,[71] but a number of specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time.[72] The layout of a team's players is known as a formation. Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager.[73]\\r\\nThere are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).[74] In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football.\\r\\nEach team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.[71]\\r\\nThe basic equipment or kit players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards. An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals.[75][76] Headgear is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.[77]\\r\\nA number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three, though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches. Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or timewasting at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match.[78] IFAB recommends \\"that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team.\\" Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations.[79]\\r\\n A game is officiated by a referee, who has \\"full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed\\" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two assistant referees. In many high-level games there is also a fourth official who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.[80]\\r\\nThe ball is spherical with a circumference of between 68 and 70 centimetres (27 and 28?in), a weight in the range of 410 to 450 grams (14 to 16?oz), and a pressure between 0.6 and 1.1 bars (8.5 and 15.6 pounds per square inch) at sea level. In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic.[81][82]\\r\\nAs the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.[83]\\r\\nThe length of the pitch, or field, for international adult matches is in the range of 100ÿ110?m (110ÿ120?yd) and the width is in the range of 64ÿ75?m (70ÿ80?yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90ÿ120?m (100ÿ130?yd) length and 45ÿ90?m (50ÿ100?yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105?m (344?ft) long and 68?m (223?ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches;[84] however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.[85]\\r\\nThe longer boundary lines are touchlines, while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are goal lines. A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line.[86] The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be 24 feet (7.3?m) apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be 8 feet (2.4?m) above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.[87]\\r\\nIn front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5?m (18?yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5?m (18?yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.[88]\\r\\nA standard adult football match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time.[89] The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents,[90][91] but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee.[89] Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1ÿ0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90?minutes had elapsed and the game was over.[92] The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.[93]\\r\\nIn league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock, some competitions may invoke replays.[94] A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of penalty shootouts (known officially in the Laws of the Game as \\"kicks from the penalty mark\\") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament. Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament (with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score).[65]\\r\\nIn competitions using two-legged matches, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required.[65]\\r\\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the IFAB experimented with ways of creating a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored (golden goal), or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time (silver goal). Golden goal was used at the World Cup in 1998 and 2002. The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was France's victory over Paraguay in 1998. Germany was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating Czech Republic in the final of Euro 1996. Silver goal was used in Euro 2004. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB.[95]\\r\\nUnder the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ball in play and ball out of play. From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:\\r\\nA foul occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of \\"penal fouls\\", punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick.[67]\\r\\nThe referee may punish a player's or substitute's misconduct by a caution (yellow card) or dismissal (red card). A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, and which results in a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been \\"booked\\", the referee writing the player's name in his official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player must leave the field. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of \\"unsporting behaviour\\" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute or substituted player. Non-players such as managers and support staff cannot be shown the yellow or red card, but may be expelled from the technical area if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner.[67]\\r\\nRather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as \\"playing an advantage\\".[101] The referee may \\"call back\\" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within \\"a few seconds\\". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.[102]\\r\\nThe referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final.[103] The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were incorrect.\\r\\nAlong with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, doping, age fraud and match fixing. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game.[104] Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card.[b] Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.[104]\\r\\nSanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on to clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, points deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the English and Scottish leagues will often deduct 10 points from a team that enters financial administration. Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.\\r\\nThe recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as futsal and beach soccer) is FIFA. The FIFA headquarters are located in Zrich, Switzerland. Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:[105]\\r\\nNational associations oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states, (for example: the Fdration Camerounaise de Football in Cameroon) but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example the Scottish Football Association in Scotland). 209 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations.[105]\\r\\nWhile FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the International Football Association Board, where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes.[37]\\r\\nThe major international competition in football is the World Cup, organised by FIFA. This competition takes place every four years since 1930 with the exception of 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled due to World War II. Approximately 190ÿ200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period.[c] The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games; the cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 FIFA World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet.[106][107][108][109] The current champion is Germany, which won its fourth title at the 2014 tournament in Brazil. FIFA Women's World Cup has been held every four years since 1991. Under the tournament's current format, national teams vie for 23 slots in a three-year qualification phase. (The host nation's team is automatically entered as the 24th slot.) The current champion is the United States, after winning their third title in the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.\\r\\nThere has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles.[110] Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) were the most most prestigious international event. Originally, the tournament was for amateurs only.[36] As professionalism spread around the world, the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened. The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. Between 1948 and 1980, 23 out of 27 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only Sweden (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), Denmark (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and Japan (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. For the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the IOC decided to admit professional players. FIFA still did not want the Olympics to rival the World Cup, so a compromise was struck that allowed teams from Africa, Asia, Oceania and CONCACAF to field their strongest professional sides, while restricting UEFA and CONMEBOL teams to players who had not played in a World Cup. Since 1992 male competitors must be under 23 years old, and since 1996, players under 23 years old, with three over-23 year old players, are allowed per squad. A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.[111]\\r\\nAfter the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa Amrica (CONMEBOL), African Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the CONCACAF Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the OFC Nations Cup (OFC). The FIFA Confederations Cup is contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current FIFA World Cup champions and the country which is hosting the Confederations Cup. This is generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and does not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself. The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the UEFA Champions League in Europe and the Copa Libertadores in South America. The winners of each continental competition contest the FIFA Club World Cup.[112]\\r\\nThe governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season, normally comprising several divisions, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into tables, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament. At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division.[113]\\r\\nThe teams finishing at the top of a country's league may be eligible also to play in international club competitions in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named Apertura and Clausura (Spanish for Opening and Closing), awarding a champion for each.[114] The majority of countries supplement the league system with one or more \\"cup\\" competitions organised on a knock-out basis.\\r\\nSome countries' top divisions feature highly paid star players; in smaller countries and lower divisions, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs. The five top European leagues?ÿ the Bundesliga (Germany), Premier League (England),[115] La Liga (Spain), Serie A (Italy), and Ligue 1 (France)?ÿ attract most of the world's best players and each of the leagues has a total wage cost in excess of S600 million/?763 million/US$1.185 billion.[116]\\r\\nVariants of football have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. five-a-side football) play in non-field environments (i.e. beach soccer, indoor soccer, and futsal) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. paralympic association football).\\r\\nCasual games can be played with only minimal equipment?ÿ a basic game can be played on almost any open area of reasonable size with just a ball and items to mark the positions of two sets of goalposts. Such games can have team sizes that vary from eleven-a-side, can use a limited or modified subset of the official rules, and can be self-officiated by the players.","input":"How many players are on a team in soccer?"},{"output":"Basiliscus","context":"Basiliscus basiliscus\\r\\nBasiliscus galeritus\\r\\nBasiliscus plumifrons\\r\\nBasiliscus vittatus\\r\\nBasiliscus is a genus of large corytophanid lizards, commonly known as basilisks, which are endemic to southern Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. They are commonly known as the Jesus Christ lizard, or simply the Jesus lizard, due to their ability to run across water for significant distances before sinking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the generic name, Basiliscus, and the common name, \\"basilisk\\", derive from the Greek basilskos (ϫ??) meaning \\"little king\\". The specific epithet, vittatus, which is Latin for \\"striped\\", was given in Carl Linnaeus' 10th edition of Systema Naturae.[1]\\r\\nThe basilisk has blue spots and a yellow iris, on average measures 70 to 75?mm (2.8 to 3.0?in), and weighs about 80 grams (2.8 ounces). Its growth is perpetual, fast when they are young and nonlinear for mature basilisks. Its long crest-like sails, reinforced in three distinct points (head, back, and tail), confer the impression of creatures such as Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus. Its skin is shed in pieces.\\r\\nThe basilisk sometimes runs as a biped. Basilisks have the unique ability to \\"run\\" on water and, because of this, they have been dubbed as \\"The Jesus Christ lizard\\" in reference to the biblical passage of Matthew 14:22-34.[2] On water, the basilisk can run at a velocity of 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) per second for approximately 4.5 meters (15 feet) before sinking on all fours and swimming.[citation needed] Flaps between their toes help support the basilisk, creating a larger surface and pockets of air, giving them the lift needed to run across water. They can also sustain themselves on all fours while \\"water-walking\\" to increase the distance travelled above the surface by about 1.3 meters (4.3 feet).\\r\\nThe basilisk can burrow into sand to hide from predators; a ring of muscles around both nostrils prevents sand from entering the basilisk's nose.\\r\\nAbundant in the tropical rain forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Ecuador and Venezuela. Recently introduced to Florida, it has adapted to the colder winters by burrowing into the leaf litter for warmth. Current reports sight the basilisk as far north as Fort Pierce, on the state's East Coast, where small groups have crept up the North Fork of the Saint Lucie River. Mainly they have been seen in Boca Raton and other cities in Palm Beach County. As recent as September 2015, a basilisk was spotted in a Miami residential neighborhood. One was captured and released in Port St. Lucie, Florida on 5/12/2017.\\r\\nGenus Basiliscus[3]","input":"What type of lizard can walk on water?"},{"output":"20 February 1868","context":"Amrita Bazar Patrika (Bengali: ????????? ???????); is one of the oldest daily newspapers in South Asia and the oldest in Bangladesh. Originally published in Bengali script,[2] it evolved into an English format published from Kolkata and other locations such as Cuttack, Ranchi and Allahabad.[3] The paper discontinued its publication in 1991 after 123 years of publication,[1][2] although it was relaunched in Dhaka in 2006 where it is now published in Bengali once again.\\r\\nIt debuted on 20 February 1868. It was started by Sisir Ghosh and Moti Lal Ghosh, sons of Hari Naryan Ghosh, a rich merchant from Magura, in Jessore District during the Bengal Presidency of the British Raj (present day in Bangladesh). The family had constructed a Bazaar and named it after Amritamoyee, wife of Hari Naryan Ghosh. Sisir Ghosh and Moti Lal Ghosh started Amrita Bazar Patrika as a weekly first. It was first edited by Motilal Ghosh, who did not have a formal university education. It had built its readership as a rival to Bengalee which was being looked after by Surendranath Banerjee.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmrita Bazaar Patrika was the oldest Indian-owned English daily. It played a major role in the evolution and growth of Indian journalism and made a striking contribution to creating and nurturing the Indian freedom struggle. In 1920, Russian Communist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin described ABP as the best nationalist paper in India.[citation needed]\\r\\nABP was born as a Bengali weekly in February 1868 in the village of Amrita Bazaar in Jessore district (now located in modern-day Bangladesh). It was started by the Ghosh brothers to fight the cause of peasants who were being exploited by indigo planters. Sisir Kumar Ghosh was the first editor. The Patrika operated out of a battered wooden press purchased for Rs 32.\\r\\nIn 1871, the Patrika moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata), due to the outbreak of plague in Amrita Bazaar. Here it functioned as a bilingual weekly, publishing news and views in English and Bengali. Its anti-government views and vast influence among the people was a thorn in the flesh of the government. Lord Lytton, the Viceroy of India promulgated the Vernacular Press Act on 1878 mainly against ABP.\\r\\nThe Patrika became a daily in 1891. It was the first Indian-owned English daily to go into investigative journalism. During the tenure of Lord Lansdowne, a Patrika journalist rummaged through the waste paper basket of the Viceroy's office and pieced together a torn up letter detailing the Viceroy's plans to annexe Kashmir. ABP published the letter on its front page, where it was read by the Maharaja of Kashmir, who immediately went to London and lobbied for his independence.\\r\\nSisir Kumar Ghosh also launched vigorous campaigns against restrictions on civil liberties and economic exploitation. He wanted Indians to be given important posts in the administration. Both he and his brother Motilal were deeply attached to Bal Gangadhar Tilak. When Tilak was prosecuted for sedition in 1897, they raised funds in Calcutta for his defence. They also published a scathing editorial against the judge who sentenced Tilak to 6 years of imprisonment, for 'presuming to teach true patriotism to a proved and unparalleled patriot.'\\r\\nThe Patrika had many brushes with Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India at the time of the Partition of Bengal (1905). It referred to him as 'Young and a little foppish, and without previous training but invested with unlimited powers.' Because of such editorials, the Press Act of 1910 was passed and a security of Rs 5,000 was demanded from ABP. Motilal Ghosh was also charged with sedition but his eloquence won the case.\\r\\nAfter this, the Patrika started prefacing articles criticising the British government with ridiculously exuberant professions of loyalty to the British crown. When Subhas Chandra Bose and other students were expelled from Calcutta Presidency College, the Patrika took up their case and succeeded in having them re-admitted.[citation needed]\\r\\nEven after Motilal Ghosh's death in 1922, the Patrika kept up its nationalist spirit. Higher securities of Rs 10,000 were demanded from it during the Salt Satyagraha. Its editor Tushar Kanti Ghosh (son of Sisir Kumar Ghosh) was imprisoned. The Patrika contributed its share to the success of its freedom movement under the leadership of Gandhi and suffered for its views and actions at the hands of the British rulers.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Patrika espoused the cause of communal harmony during the Partition of India. During the great Calcutta killings of 1946, the Patrika left its editorial columns blank for three days. When freedom dawned on August 15, 1947, the Patrika published in an editorial:\\r\\nIt is dawn, cloudy though it is. Presently sunshine will break.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs a part of the 'Endangered Archive project' attempting to rescue text published prior to 1950, the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta took up the project of digitizing the old newspapers (ABP and Jugantar) for safe storage and retrieval in 2010.[5] The newspaper archives are also available from the Nehru Memorial Museum & Library, Delhi, and in 2011 over one lakh images from the newspaper were digitized by the library and available online.[6] and also at The Centre of South Asian Studies at the University of Cambridge.","input":"When was the amrit bazar patrika started in bangla?"},{"output":"February 12, 1914","context":"The Lincoln Memorial is an American national monument built to honor the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. It is located on the western end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., across from the Washington Monument. The architect was Henry Bacon; the designer of the primary statue ÿ Abraham Lincoln, 1920 ÿ was Daniel Chester French; the Lincoln statue was carved by the Piccirilli Brothers;[2] and the painter of the interior murals was Jules Guerin. Dedicated in 1922, it is one of several monuments built to honor an American president. It has always been a major tourist attraction and since the 1930s has been a symbolic center focused on race relations.\\r\\nThe building is in the form of a Greek Doric temple and contains a large seated sculpture of Abraham Lincoln and inscriptions of two well-known speeches by Lincoln, \\"The Gettysburg Address\\" and his Second Inaugural Address. The memorial has been the site of many famous speeches, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech, delivered on August 28, 1963, during the rally at the end of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\\r\\nLike other monuments on the National Mall ÿ including the nearby Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Korean War Veterans Memorial, and National World War II Memorial ÿ the memorial is administered by the National Park Service under its National Mall and Memorial Parks group. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since October 15, 1966. It is open to the public 24 hours a day. In 2007, it was ranked seventh on the List of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects. Since 2010, approximately 6 million people visit the memorial annually.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first public memorial to Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C., was a statue by Lot Flannery erected in front of the District of Columbia City Hall in 1868, three years after Lincoln's assassination.[4][5] Demands for a fitting national memorial had been voiced since the time of Lincoln's death. In 1867, Congress passed the first of many bills incorporating a commission to erect a monument for the sixteenth president. An American sculptor, Clark Mills, was chosen to design the monument. His plans reflected the nationalistic spirit of the time, and called for a 70-foot (21?m) structure adorned with six equestrian and 31 pedestrian statues of colossal proportions, crowned by a 12-foot (3.7?m) statue of Abraham Lincoln. Subscriptions for the project were insufficient.[6]\\r\\nThe matter lay dormant until the start of the 20th century, when, under the leadership of Senator Shelby M. Cullom of Illinois, six separate bills were introduced in Congress for the incorporation of a new memorial commission. The first five bills, proposed in the years 1901, 1902, and 1908, met with defeat because of opposition from Speaker Joe Cannon. The sixth bill (Senate Bill 9449), introduced on December 13, 1910, passed. The Lincoln Memorial Commission had its first meeting the following year and U.S. President William H. Taft was chosen as the commission's president. Progress continued at a steady pace and by 1913 Congress had approved of the Commission's choice of design and location.[6]\\r\\nThere were questions regarding the commission's plan. Many thought that architect Henry Bacon's Greek temple design was far too ostentatious for a man of Lincoln's humble character. Instead they proposed a simple log cabin shrine. The site too did not go unopposed. The recently reclaimed land in West Potomac Park was seen by many to be either too swampy or too inaccessible. Other sites, such as Union Station, were put forth. The Commission stood firm in its recommendation, feeling that the Potomac Park location, situated on the Washington Monument-Capitol axis, overlooking the Potomac River and surrounded by open land, was ideal. Furthermore, the Potomac Park site had already been designated in the McMillan Plan of 1901 to be the location of a future monument comparable to that of the Washington Monument.[6][7]\\r\\nWith Congressional approval and a $300,000 allocation, the project got underway. On February 12, 1914, a dedication ceremony was conducted and the following month the actual construction began. Work progressed steadily according to schedule. Some changes were made to the plan. The statue of Lincoln, originally designed to be 10 feet (3.0?m) tall, was enlarged to 19 feet (5.8?m) to prevent it from being overwhelmed by the huge chamber. As late as 1920, the decision was made to substitute an open portal for the bronze and glass grille which was to have guarded the entrance. Despite these changes, the Memorial was finished on schedule. Commission president William H. Taft ÿ who was then Chief Justice of the United States ÿ dedicated the Memorial on May 30, 1922 and presented it to President Warren G. Harding, who accepted it on behalf of the American people. Lincoln's only surviving son, 78-year-old Robert Todd Lincoln, was in attendance.[8]\\r\\nThe Memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.[9]\\r\\nThe exterior of the Memorial echoes a classic Greek temple and features Yule marble from Colorado. The structure measures 189.7 by 118.5 feet (57.8 by 36.1?m) and is 99 feet (30?m) tall. It is surrounded by a peristyle of 36 fluted Doric columns, one for each of the 36 states in the Union at the time of Lincoln's death, and two columns in-antis at the entrance behind the colonnade. The columns stand 44 feet (13?m) tall with a base diameter of 7.5 feet (2.3?m). Each column is built from 12 drums including the capital. The columns, like the exterior walls and facades, are inclined slightly toward the building's interior. This is to compensate for perspective distortions which would otherwise make the memorial appear to bulge out at the top when compared with the bottom, a common feature of Ancient Greek architecture.[10]\\r\\nAbove the colonnade, inscribed on the frieze, are the names of the 36 states in the Union at the time of Lincoln's death and the dates in which they entered the Union.[Note 1] Their names are separated by double wreath medallions in bas-relief. The cornice is composed of a carved scroll regularly interspersed with projecting lions' heads and ornamented with palmetto cresting along the upper edge. Above this on the attic frieze are inscribed the names of the 48 states present at the time of the Memorial's dedication. A bit higher is a garland joined by ribbons and palm leaves, supported by the wings of eagles. All ornamentation on the friezes and cornices was done by Ernest C. Bairstow.[10]\\r\\nThe Memorial is anchored in a concrete foundation, 44 to 66 feet (13 to 20?m) in depth, constructed by M. F. Comer and Company and the National Foundation and Engineering Company, and is encompassed by a 187-by-257-foot (57 by 78?m) rectangular granite retaining wall measuring 14 feet (4.3?m) in height.[10]\\r\\nLeading up to the shrine on the east side are the main steps. Beginning at the edge of the Reflecting Pool, the steps rise to the Lincoln Memorial Circle roadway surrounding the edifice, then to the main portal, intermittently spaced with a series of platforms. Flanking the steps as they approach the entrance are two buttresses each crowned with an 11-foot (3.4?m) tall tripod carved from pink Tennessee marble[10] by the Piccirilli Brothers.[11]\\r\\nThe Memorial's interior is divided into three chambers by two rows of four Ionic columns, each 50 feet (15?m) tall and 5.5 feet (1.7?m) across at their base. The central chamber, housing the statue of Lincoln, is 60 feet wide, 74 feet deep, and 60 feet high.[12] The north and south chambers display carved inscriptions of Lincoln's second inaugural address and his Gettysburg Address.[Note 2] Bordering these inscriptions are pilasters ornamented with fasces, eagles, and wreaths. The inscriptions and adjoining ornamentation are by Evelyn Beatrice Longman.[10]\\r\\nThe Memorial is replete with symbolic elements. The 36 columns represent the states of the Union at the time of Lincoln's death; the 48 stone festoons above the columns represent the 48 states in 1922. Inside, each inscription is surmounted by a 60-by-12-foot (18.3 by 3.7?m) mural by Jules Guerin portraying principles seen as evident in Lincoln's life: Freedom, Liberty, Immortality, Justice, and the Law on the south wall; Unity, Fraternity, and Charity on the north. Cypress trees, representing Eternity, are in the murals' backgrounds. The murals' paint incorporated kerosene and wax to protect the exposed artwork from fluctuations in temperature and moisture.[13]\\r\\nThe ceiling consists of bronze girders ornamented with laurel and oak leaves. Between these are panels of Alabama marble, saturated with paraffin to increase translucency. But feeling that the statue required even more light, Bacon and French designed metal slats for the ceiling to conceal floodlights, which could be modulated to supplement the natural light; this modification was installed in 1929. The one major alteration since was the addition of a handicapped elevator in the 1970s.[13]\\r\\nIN THIS TEMPLE\\r\\nAS IN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE\\r\\nFOR WHOM HE SAVED THE UNION\\r\\nTHE MEMORY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN\\r\\nIS ENSHRINED FOREVER\\r\\nLying between the north and south chambers is the central hall containing the solitary figure of Lincoln sitting in contemplation. The statue was carved by the Piccirilli Brothers under the supervision of the sculptor, Daniel Chester French, and took four years to complete. The statue, originally intended to be only 10 feet (3.0?m) tall, was, on further consideration, enlarged so that it finally stood 19 feet (5.8?m) tall from head to foot, the scale being such that if Lincoln were standing, he would be 28 feet (8.5?m) tall. The widest span of the statue corresponds to its height. Of Georgia white marble, it weighs 175 short tons (159?t) and was shipped in twenty-eight pieces.[13]\\r\\nThe statue rests upon an oblong pedestal of Tennessee marble 10 feet (3.0?m) high, 16 feet (4.9?m) wide, and 17 feet (5.2?m) deep. Directly beneath this lies a platform of Tennessee marble about 34.5 feet (10.5?m) long, 28 feet (8.5?m) wide, and 6.5 inches (0.17?m) high. Lincoln's arms rest on representations of Roman fasces, a subtle touch that associates the statue with the Augustan (and imperial) theme (obelisk and funerary monuments) of the Washington Mall.[14] The statue is discretely bordered by two pilasters, one on each side. Between these pilasters, and above Lincoln's head, is engraved an epitaph of Lincoln[13] by Royal Cortissoz.[15]\\r\\nThe sculpture has been at the center of two urban legends. Some have claimed that the face of General Robert E. Lee was carved onto the back of Lincoln's head,[16] and looks back across the Potomac toward his former home, Arlington House, now within the bounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Another popular legend is that Lincoln is shown using sign language to represent his initials, with his left hand shaped to form an \\"A\\" and his right hand to form an \\"L\\", the president's initials. The National Park Service denies both legends.[16]\\r\\nHowever, historian Gerald Prokopowicz writes that, while it is not clear that sculptor Daniel Chester French intended Lincoln's hands to be formed into sign language versions of his initials, it is possible that French did intend it, because he was familiar with American Sign Language, and he would have had a reason to do so, that is, to pay tribute to Lincoln for having signed the federal legislation giving Gallaudet University, a university for the deaf, the authority to grant college degrees.[17] The National Geographic Society's publication, \\"Pinpointing the Past in Washington, D.C.\\" states that Daniel Chester French had a son who was deaf and that the sculptor was familiar with sign language.[18][19] Historian James A. Percoco has observed that, although there are no extant documents showing that French had Lincoln's hands carved to represent the letters \\"A\\" and \\"L\\" in American Sign Language, \\"I think you can conclude that it's reasonable to have that kind of summation about the hands.\\"[20]\\r\\nAs Sandage (1993) demonstrates, the Memorial has become a symbolically sacred venue especially for the Civil Rights Movement. In 1939, the Daughters of the American Revolution refused to allow the African-American contralto Marian Anderson to perform before an integrated audience at the organization's Constitution Hall. At the suggestion of Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harold L. Ickes, the Secretary of the Interior, arranged for a performance on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Easter Sunday of that year, to a live audience of 70,000, and a nationwide radio audience.\\r\\nOn August 28, 1963, the memorial grounds were the site of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which proved to be a high point of the American Civil Rights Movement. It is estimated that approximately 250,000 people came to the event, where they heard Martin Luther King Jr., deliver his historic I Have a Dream speech before the memorial honoring the president who had issued the Emancipation Proclamation 100 years earlier. King's speech, with its language of patriotism and its evocation of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, was meant to match the symbolism of the Lincoln Memorial as a monument to national unity.[21] The D.C. police also appreciated the location because it was surrounded on three sides by water, so that any incident could be easily contained.[22] Twenty years later, on August 28, 1983, crowds gathered again to mark the 20th Anniversary Mobilization for Jobs, Peace and Freedom, to reflect on progress in gaining civil rights for African Americans and to commit to correcting continuing injustices. The \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech is such a part of the Lincoln Memorial story, that the spot on which King stood, on the landing eighteen steps below Lincoln's statue, was engraved in 2003 in recognition of the 40th anniversary of the event.\\r\\nAt the memorial on May 9, 1970, President Richard Nixon had a middle-of-the-night impromptu, brief meeting with protesters who, just days after the Kent State shootings, were preparing to march against the Vietnam War.\\r\\nIn September 1962, vandals painted the words \\"nigger lover\\" in foot-high pink letters on the rear wall.[23]\\r\\nOn the morning of July 26, 2013, the memorial was shut down after the statue's base and legs were splashed with green paint.[24] It reopened later that day.[25] A 58-year-old Chinese national, Jiamei Tian, was later found responsible for the vandalism. Following her arrest at the Washington National Cathedral, she was admitted to St. Elizabeths Hospital, a psychiatric facility, and was later found to be incompetent to stand trial; she has since been released from the hospital.[26]\\r\\nOn February 27, 2017, graffiti written in permanent marker was found at the memorial, the Washington Monument, the District of Columbia War Memorial, and the National World War II Memorial, saying \\"Jackie shot JFK\\", \\"blood test is a lie\\", as well as other claims. Street signs and utility boxes were also defaced. Authorities believed that a single person was responsible for all the vandalism.[27]\\r\\nOn August 15, 2017, graffiti that Reuters reported \\"appeared to read 'fuck law'\\" was spray painted in red on one of the columns. The initials \\"M+E\\" were etched on the same pillar. A \\"mild, gel-type architectural paint stripper\\" was used to remove the paint without damaging the memorial. However, the etching was deemed \\"permanent damage.\\" A Smithsonian Institution directional sign several blocks away was also defaced.[28][29]\\r\\nOn September 18, 2017, Nurtilek Bakirov from Kyrgyzstan was arrested when a police officer saw him vandalizing the Memorial at around 1:00 PM EDT. Bakirov used a penny to carve the letters \\"HYPT MAEK\\" in what appeared to Cyrillic letters into the fifth pillar on the north side. As of 20?September?2017[update], police do not know what the words mean, although there is a possibility that they contain a reference to the vandal's name. Court documents indicate that the letters can not be completely removed, but could be polished at the cost of approximately $2,000. A conservator for the National Park Service said that the stone would weather over time, helping to obscure the letters, although she characterized it as \\"permanent damage\\".[30]\\r\\nAs one of the most prominent American monuments, the Lincoln Memorial is often featured in books, films, and television shows that take place in Washington; by 2003 it had appeared in over 60 films,[31] and in 2009, Mark S. Reinhart compiled some short sketches of dozens of uses of the Memorial in film and television.[32]\\r\\nSome examples of films include Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, in a key scene where the statue and its inscription provide inspiration to freshman Senator Jefferson Smith, played by James Stewart[33] ÿ the Park Service did not want director Frank Capra to film at the Memorial, so he sent a large crew elsewhere as a distraction while a smaller crew filmed Stewart and Jean Arthur at the Memorial;[34] The Day the Earth Stood Still, a science fiction film in which the alien Klaatu visits the Memorial and is impressed by Lincoln's words carved there; the 2001 version of Planet of the Apes; X-Men: First Class; the 2011 film Transformers: Dark of the Moon, where Megatron destroys the statue of Lincoln and then sits on the chair as a throne;[35] and the 2016 horror movie The Purge: Election Year, in which the Lincoln Memorial is shown with dead and burning bodies on the steps and the columns defaced with giant letters that spell out \\"PURGE\\", written in human blood.[36]\\r\\nOther films and television programs which have featured the Memorial include In the Line of Fire; National Treasure, in which the main characters discuss the possibility of stealing the Declaration of Independence while sitting on the steps of the Memorial; the comedy Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, where the statue of Lincoln helps defeat the Horus warriors; the \\"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\\" episode of The Simpsons;[37] the scene from Forrest Gump, in which Forrest (Tom Hanks) delivers a speech standing on a podium in front of the Memorial facing the reflecting pool; and the 2013 film White House Down, in which the President (Jamie Foxx) requests a fly-by of the Lincoln Memorial, at both the beginning and the end of the movie to pay homage to his hero.[33]\\r\\nMany of the appearances of the Lincoln Memorial are actually digital visual effects, due to restrictive filming rules.[37] As of 2017, according to the National Park Service, \\"Filming/photography is prohibited above the white marble steps and the interior chamber of the Lincoln Memorial.\\"[38]\\r\\nMitchell Newton-Matza argued in 2016, \\"Reflecting its cherished place in the hearts of Americans, the Lincoln Memorial has often been featured prominently in popular culture, especially motion pictures.\\"[39] According to Tracey Gold Bennett, \\"The majesty of the Lincoln Memorial is a big draw for film location scouts, producers, and directors because this landmark has appeared in a considerable number of films.\\"[40]\\r\\nJay Sacher writes:\\r\\nFrom high to low, the memorial is cultural shorthand for both American ideals and 1960s radicalism. From Forrest Gump's Zelig-like insertion into anti-war rallies on the steps of the memorial, to the villainous Decepticon robots discarding the Lincoln statue and claiming it as a throne....The memorial's place in the culture is assured even as it is parodied.[37]\\r\\nFrom 1959 (the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's birth) to 2008, the memorial, with statue visible through the columns, was depicted on the reverse of the United States one-cent coin, which since 1909 has depicted a bust of Lincoln on its front.\\r\\nThe memorial has appeared on the back of the U.S. five-dollar bill since 1929.

He was also known for laundering money via Colombia to finance his large fleet of airplanes.\\r\\nHe died in July 1997, in a Mexican hospital, after undergoing extensive plastic surgery to change his appearance.[3][4][5] In his final days Carrillo was being tracked by Mexican and U.S. authorities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrillo was born to Walter Vicente Carillo Vega and Aurora Fuentes in Guamuchilito, Navolato, Sinaloa, Mexico. He was the first of six sons; the others were: Cipriano, Enrique B., Vicente, Jos Cruz, Enrique C., and Jorge. He also had five sisters: Mara Luisa, Berthila, Flor, Alicia, and Aurora.\\r\\nThese children were the nieces and nephews of Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, a/k/a \\"Don Neto\\", the Guadalajara Cartel leader. Amado got his start in the drug business under the tutelage of his uncle Ernesto and later brought in his brothers, and eventually his son Vicente Jos Carrillo Leyva.\\r\\nCarrillo's father died in April 1986. Carillo's oldest brother, Cipriano Carrillo Fuentes, died in 1989 under mysterious circumstances.[citation needed]\\r\\nInitially, Carrillo was part of the Guadalajara Cartel, sent to Ojinaga, Chihuahua to oversee the cocaine shipments of his uncle, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo (\\"Don Neto\\"), and to learn about border operations from Pablo Acosta Villarreal (\\"El Zorro de Ojinaga\\"; \\"The Ojinaga Fox\\") and Rafael Aguilar Guajardo.[6][7] During his tenure, Carrillo reportedly built a multibillion-dollar drug empire. It was estimated that he may have made over US$25 billion in revenue in his career.[8]\\r\\nThe pressure to capture Carrillo intensified among U.S. and Mexican authorities,[when?][why?] and perhaps for this reason, Carrillo underwent facial plastic surgery and abdominal liposuction to change his appearance on July 4, 1997, at Santa M܇nica Hospital in Mexico City. However, during the operation, he died of complications apparently caused either by a medication or a malfunctioning respirator. Two of Carrillo's bodyguards were in the operating room during the procedure. On November 7, 1997, the two physicians who performed the surgery on Fuentes were found dead, encased in concrete inside steel drums, with their bodies showing signs of torture.[9]\\r\\nOn the night of August 3, 1997, at around 9:30?p.m., four drug traffickers walked into a restaurant in Ciudad Jurez, pulled out their guns, and opened fire on five diners, killing them instantly.[10] Police estimated that more than 100 bullet casings were found at the crime scene. According to a report issued by the Los Angeles Times, four men went to the restaurant carrying at least two AK-47 assault rifles while others stood at the doorstep.[10][11] On their way out, the gunmen claimed another victim:[12] Armando Olague, a prison official and off-duty law enforcement officer, who was gunned down outside the restaurant after he had walked from a nearby bar to investigate the shooting. Reportedly, Olague had run into the restaurant from across the street with a gun in his hand to check out the commotion. It was later determined that Olague was also a known lieutenant of the Juarez cartel.[12] Mexican authorities declined to comment on the motives behind the killing, stating the shootout was not linked to the death of Amado Carrillo Fuentes. Nonetheless, it was later stated that the perpetrators were gunmen of the Tijuana Cartel.[10][13] Although confrontations between narcotraficantes were commonplace in Ciudad Jurez, they rarely occurred in public places. What happened in the restaurant threatened to usher in a new era of border crime in the city.[12]\\r\\nIn Ciudad Jurez, the PGR seized warehouses they believed the cartel used to store weapons and cocaine; they also seized over 60 properties all over Mexico belonging to Carrillo, and began an investigation into his dealings with police and government officials. Officials also froze bank accounts amounting to $10 billion belonging to Carrillo.[14] In April 2009, Mexican authorities arrested Carillo's son, Vicente Carrillo Leyva.[15]\\r\\nCarrillo was given a large and expensive funeral in Guamuchilito, Sinaloa. In 2006, Governor Eduardo Bours asked the federal government to tear down Carrillo's mansion in Hermosillo, Sonora.[16] The mansion, dubbed \\"The Palace of a Thousand and One Nights\\", although still standing, remains unoccupied.[citation needed]","input":"Cual es el verdadero nombre del se?or de los cielos?"},{"output":"reforming or purifying the Church of England of all remaining Roman Catholic teachings and practices","context":"In the early 17th century, thousands of English Puritans settled in North America, mainly in New England. Puritans were generally members of the Church of England who believed that the Church of England was insufficiently reformed, retaining too much of its Roman Catholic doctrinal roots, and who therefore opposed royal ecclesiastical policy under Elizabeth I of England, James I of England, and Charles I of England. Most Puritans were \\"non-separating Puritans\\", meaning that they did not advocate setting up separate congregations distinct from the Church of England; a small minority of Puritans were \\"separating Puritans\\" who advocated setting up congregations outside the Church. The Pilgrims were a Separatist group, and they established the Plymouth Colony in 1620. Non-separating Puritans played leading roles in establishing the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629, the Saybrook Colony in 1635, the Connecticut Colony in 1636, and the New Haven Colony in 1638. The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations was established by settlers expelled from the Massachusetts Bay Colony because of their unorthodox religious opinions. Puritans were also active in New Hampshire before it became a crown colony in 1691.\\r\\nMost Puritans who migrated to North America came in the decade 1630-1640 in what is known as the Great Migration. See the main articles on each of the colonies for information on their political and social history; this article focuses on the religious history of the Puritans in North America.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPuritanism was a Protestant movement that emerged in 16thÿcentury England with the goal of transforming it into a godly society by reforming or purifying the Church of England of all remaining Roman Catholic teachings and practices.[1] During the reign of Elizabeth I, Puritans were for the most part tolerated within the established church. Like Puritans, most English Protestants at the time were Calvinist in their theology, and many bishops and Privy Council members were sympathetic to Puritan objectives. The major point of controversy between Puritans and church authorities was over liturgical ceremonies Puritans thought too Catholic, such as wearing clerical vestments, kneeling to receive Holy Communion, and making the sign of the cross during baptism.[2]\\r\\nDuring the reign of James I, some Puritans were no longer willing to wait for further church reforms. These Separatists left the national church and began holding their own religious meetings, with many migrating to the Netherlands in order to escape persecution and worship freely. Nevertheless, most Puritans remained within the Church of England.[3]\\r\\nUnder Charles I, Calvinist teachings were undermined and bishops became less tolerant of Puritan views and more willing to enforce the use of controversial ceremonies. New controls were placed on Puritan preaching, and some ministers were suspended or removed from their livings. Increasingly, many Puritans concluded that they had no choice but to emigrate.[4]\\r\\nIn 1620, a group of Separatists known as the Pilgrims settled in New England and established the Plymouth Colony. The Pilgrims originated as a dissenting congregation in Scrooby led by William Brewster, Richard Clyfton and John Robinson. This congregation was subject to ecclesiastical investigation, and its members faced social hostility from conforming church members. Fearing increasing persecution, the group left England and settled in the Dutch city of Leiden. In 1620, after receiving a patent from the London Company, the Pilgrims left for New England on board the Mayflower, landing at Plymouth Rock.\\r\\nTwo of the Pilgrim settlers in Plymouth Colony - Robert Cushman and Edward Winslow - believed that Cape Ann would be a profitable location for a settlement. They therefore organized a company which they named the Dorchester Company and in 1622 sailed to England seeking a patent from the London Company giving them permission to settle there. They were successful and were granted the Sheffield Patent (named after Edmond, Lord Sheffield, the member of the Plymouth Company who granted the patent). On the basis of this patent, Roger Conant led a group of fishermen to found Salem in 1626, being replaced as governor by John Endecott in 1627.\\r\\nOther Puritans were convinced that New England could provide a religious refuge, and the enterprise was reorganized as the Massachusetts Bay Company. In March 1629, it succeeded in obtaining from King Charles a royal charter for the establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1630, the first ships of the Great Puritan Migration sailed to the New World, led by John Winthrop.[5]\\r\\nDuring the crossing, Winthrop preached a sermon entitled \\"A Model of Christian Charity\\", in which he told his followers that they had entered a covenant with God according to which he would cause them to prosper if they maintained their commitment to God. In doing so, their new colony would become a \\"City upon a Hill\\", meaning that they would be a model to all the nations of Europe as to what a properly reformed Christian commonwealth should look like.[6]\\r\\nMost of the Puritans who emigrated settled in the New England area. However, the Great Migration of Puritans was relatively short-lived and not as large as is often believed. It began in earnest in 1629 with the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and ended in 1642 with the start of the English Civil War, when King Charles I effectively shut off emigration to the colonies. Emigration was officially restricted to conforming churchmen in December 1634 by his Privy Council.[7] From 1629 through 1643, approximately 21,000 Puritans immigrated to New England.\\r\\nThe Great Migration of Puritans to New England was primarily an exodus of families. Between 1630 and 1640, over 13,000 men, women, and children sailed to Massachusetts. The religious and political factors behind the Great Migration influenced the demographics of the emigrants. Groups of young men seeking economic success predominated the Virginia colonies, whereas Puritan ships were laden with ordinary people, old and young, families as well as individuals. Just a quarter of the emigrants were in their twenties when they boarded ship in the 1630s, making young adults a minority in New England settlements. The New World Puritan population was more of a cross section in age of English population than those of other colonies. This meant that the Massachusetts Bay Colony retained a relatively normal population composition. In the colony of Virginia, the ratio of colonist men to women was 4:1 in early decades and at least 2:1 in later decades, and only limited intermarriage took place with Indian women. By contrast, nearly half of the Puritan immigrants to the New World were women, and there was very little intermarriage with Indians. The majority of families who traveled to Massachusetts Bay were families in progress, with parents who were not yet through with their reproductive years and whose continued fertility made New Englands population growth possible. The women who emigrated were critical agents in the success of the establishment and maintenance of the Puritan colonies in North America. Success in the early colonial economy depended largely on labor, which was conducted by members of Puritan families.\\r\\nThe struggle between the assertive Church of England and various Presbyterian and Puritan groups extended throughout the English realm in the 17th Century, prompting not only the re-emigration of British Protestants from Ireland to North America (the so-called Scotch-Irish), but prompting emigration from Bermuda, England's second-oldest overseas territory. Roughly 10,000 Bermudians emigrated before US Independence. Most of these went to the American colonies, founding, or contributing to settlements throughout the South, especially. Many had also gone to the Bahamas, where a number of Bermudian Independent Puritan families, under the leadership of William Sayle, had established the colony of Eleuthera in 1648.\\r\\nSome Puritans also migrated to colonies in Central America and the Caribbean, see Providence Island Company, Mosquito Coast and Providencia Island.\\r\\nAs noted earlier, the vast majority of Puritans who settled in the Massachusetts Bay Colony were non-separating Puritans. They deeply abhorred many of the practices of the Church of England, but they refused to separate from the Church of England because they placed an extremely high value on the doctrine of the unity of the Church. They viewed the Separating Puritans as schismatics. Thus, the Puritans in Massachusetts erected their church along Presbyterian-Congregational lines, but they technically remained in full communion with the Church of England. This position led to two major theological controversies in the course of the 1630s: the Roger Williams controversy, and the Anne Hutchinson controversy.\\r\\nRoger Williams, a Separating Puritan minister, arrived in Boston in 1631. He was almost immediately invited to become the pastor of the local congregation, but he refused the invitation on the grounds that the congregation had not separated from the Church of England. He then was invited to become pastor of the church at Salem, but was blocked by Boston political leaders, who objected to his separatism. He thus spent two years with his fellow Separatists in the Plymouth Colony, but ultimately came into conflict with them and returned to Salem, where he became pastor in May 1635, against the objection of the Boston authorities. Williams set forth a manifesto in which he declared that 1) the Church of England was apostate and fellowship with it was a grievous sin; 2) the Massachusetts Colony's charter falsely said that King Charles was a Christian; 3) the colony should not be allowed to impose oaths on its citizens, because that was forbidden by Matthew 5:33-37\\r\\nWilliams' actions so outraged the Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony that they expelled him from the colony. In 1636, the exiled Williams founded the colony of Providence Plantation. He was one of the first Puritans to advocate separation of church and state, and Providence Plantation was one of the first places in the Christian world to recognize freedom of religion.\\r\\nAnne Hutchinson and her family moved from Boston, Lincolnshire to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634, following their Puritan minister John Cotton. Cotton began pastoring a congregation in Boston, Massachusetts, and Hutchinson joined his congregation. Following the Puritan practice of conventicling, Hutchinson set up a conventicle in her home. At the conventicle, a group would meet during the week to discuss John Cotton's sermon from the previous Sunday. Hutchinson proved to be extremely charismatic at propounding on Cotton's ideas during these conventicles, and eventually the size of her conventicle swelled to 80 people and had to be moved from her home to the church building.\\r\\nCotton had long denounced Arminianism in his sermons. Hutchinson took up the anti-Arminian cause in strong language, propounding an extreme form of double predestination (a view popularized among English Puritans by William Perkins), which held that God chose those who would go to heaven (the elect) and those who would go to hell (the reprobate), and that His decision inevitably and infallibly came to pass. Applying this framework to the Arminian controversy, Hutchinson argued that people were either under a covenant of works (they were relying on good works for their salvation, and therefore were really damned) or else a covenant of grace (in which case they were dependent only on God's grace, and were therefore really saved).\\r\\nBy 1637, Hutchinson's teachings had grown controversial within the colony for a number of reasons. First, some Puritans objected to a woman occupying such a prominent role as a teacher in the church. Second, Hutchinson began denouncing various Puritan ministers in the colony as really preaching a \\"covenant of works\\" and sometimes spoke as if John Cotton were the only minister in the entire colony who was preaching a \\"covenant of grace\\" correctly. Thirdly, some of Hutchinson's views on the \\"covenant of grace\\" seemed indistinguishable from the heresy of antinomianism, the view that the elect did not have to follow the laws of God or morality.\\r\\nHutchinson was called before the Massachusetts General Court to explain herself. She sparred verbally with the magistrates successfully on a number of issues, but was ultimately undone when she said that she had determined that she would be persecuted when she came to New England. When the magistrates asked her how she had determined this, she responded \\"by an immediate revelation\\" i.e. God had spoken to her and told her so. The Puritans generally followed the principle of sola scriptura and believed that God communicated with individuals only through the medium of scripture. As such, for the magistrates of the General Court, who were already suspicious of Hutchinson's orthodoxy, the claim that God was speaking directly to her was the final straw. They therefore voted to banish her from the colony. As a result, in 1638, Hutchinson and several of her followers left the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded the town of Pocasset, which today is Portsmouth, Rhode Island.\\r\\nAs time passes and different perspectives arise within the scholarship of witchcraft and its involvement in Puritan New England, many scholars have stepped forth to contribute to what we know in regards to this subject. For instance, diverse perspectives involving the witch trials have been argued involving gender, race, economics, religion, and the social oppression that Puritans lived through that explain in a more in-depth way how Puritanism contributed to the trials and executions. Puritan fears, beliefs and institutions were the perfect storm that fueled the witch craze in towns such as Salem from an interdisciplinary and anthropological approach. [8] From a gendered approach, offered by Carol Karlsen and Elizabeth Reis, the question of why witches were primarily women did not fully surface until after the second wave of feminism in the 1980s. Some believe that women who were gaining economic or social power, specifically in the form of land inheritance, were at a higher risk of being tried as witches. [9] Others maintain that females were more susceptible to being witches as the Puritans believed that the weak body was a pathway to the soul which both God and the Devil fought for. Due to the Puritan belief that female bodies \\"lacked the strength and vitality\\" compared to male bodies, females were more susceptible to make a choice to enter a covenant with Satan as their fragile bodies could not protect their souls. [10] From a racial perspective, Puritans believed that African Americans and Native Americans living within the colonies were viewed as \\"true witches\\" from an anthropological sense as Blacks were considered \\"inherently evil creatures, unable to control their connection to Satanic wickedness.\\" [11] Another contribution made to scholarship includes the religious perspective that historians attempt to understand its effect on the witch trials. John Demos, a major scholar in the field of Puritan witchcraft studies, maintains that the intense and oppressive nature of Puritan religion can be viewed as the main culprit in the Colonial witch trials. [12] While many scholars provide different arguments to Puritanism and witchcraft, all of the various camps mentioned rely on each other in numerous ways in order to build on our understanding of the witch craze in early American History. As more perspectives from different scholars add to the knowledge of the Puritan involvement in the witch trials, a more complete picture and history will form.\\r\\nNew England society rested on the rock of the Puritan family, economically and religiously. Women were thus entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring that children grew into virtuous Puritan adults. This new moral and religious significance given to everyday life, marriage, and family brought womens activities into the spotlight. Although the patriarch directed work and devotion within the family, the proof of success in the New World was in a harmonious marriage and godly childrenboth of which fell under the jurisdiction of the Puritan woman. The success of The Great Migration and establishment of successful Puritan colonies in the New World thus depended heavily on the role of women within the settlement.\\r\\nIn the 1660s the Puritan settlements in the New World were confronted with the challenge posed by an aging first generation. Those who created the colonies were the most fervent in their religious beliefs, and as their numbers began to decline, so did the membership of churches. The demographics of the churches changed because fewer men were joining. The resulting decrease in male religious participation was a problem for the established church (that is, the colonys official church for which people were taxed and which they were expected to attend), since men were the ones with secular power. If the men who wielded secular power in the colony were absent from the church, its legitimacy would be undermined. As early as 1660, women constituted the great majority of church members. However, since Anne Hutchinsons banishment, they were not allowed to talk in church (for more information, see below under \\"Beliefs\\"). Puritan ministers, concerned for the continued existence and power of their churches in the colonies, pushed for a solution to declining church membership. This effort led to the creation of the Halfway Covenant, in order to boost participation in the Puritan church.\\r\\nEmigration resumed under the rule of Cromwell, but not in large numbers as there was no longer any need to \\"escape persecution\\" in England. In fact, many Puritans returned to England during the war. \\"In 1641, when the English Civil War began, some immigrants returned to fight on the Puritan side, and when the Puritans won, many resumed English life under Oliver Cromwell's more congenial Puritan sway.\\"[1]\\r\\nPuritan oppression led to the voluntary or involuntary banishment of many religious leaders and their followers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. This led or contributed to the founding of new colonies as religious havens for those who wanted to live outside of the existing theocracy.[13]","input":"What was the goal of the puritan colony?"},{"output":"an annual National Football League exhibition game that is held the weekend of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's induction ceremonies","context":"The Pro Football Hall of Fame Game is an annual National Football League exhibition game that is held the weekend of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's induction ceremonies. The game is played at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, which is located adjacent to the Hall of Fame building in Canton, Ohio. It is traditionally the first game in the NFL's preseason, marking the end of the NFL's six-month offseason.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two teams that play in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game are typically selected by the league in advance of the remainder of the preseason schedule. The participants are usually announced around the time that the new Hall of Fame members are announced, which coincides with Super Bowl week. Often if a particularly notable player will be entering the Hall of Fame that year a team they were strongly associated with may be selected to play in the game to help maximize attendance and publicity of the game itself. Since 1971, the opponents for each game have traditionally included one AFC team and one NFC team. In 2009, as recognition of the 50th anniversary of the American Football League, the game paired two AFC teams who were part of the \\"original eight\\" franchises of the AFL, the Tennessee Titans (dressed as their previous incarnation, the Houston Oilers) and the Buffalo Bills, whose owner, Ralph Wilson, was inducted into the Hall that year. An all-NFC matchup was scheduled for 2011,[1] but it was canceled due to the 2011 NFL lockout; the following year, another intra-conference matchup of two NFC teams took its place. Since 2012, both competing teams in the game has had at least one prominent alumnus being inducted into the Hall that year.\\r\\nBecause this game and the Hall of Fame's induction ceremonies are scheduled on the weekend before the league's regular four-week exhibition season begins, both teams end up playing five exhibition games instead of the normal four, and unlike the Canadian Football League, the league does not remove an exhibition game from another week.\\r\\nThe last four expansion teams to have been added to the league each played in the Hall of Fame Game as their first game. In 1995, expansion clubs Jacksonville and Carolina played one another, and in 2002, Houston was one of the participants. When the Cleveland Browns returned to the league with a rebooted roster in 1999, they too played in the Hall of Fame Game. (The Baltimore Ravens, while officially considered as being established in 1996, did not play in the Hall of Fame Game that year, nor have they played at any time in their existence.)\\r\\nPrior to the AFL-NFL merger, the Hall of Fame Game was played in August or September, in some cases at the end of the preseason. In 1970, it was moved to the beginning of the preseason. Prior to 2002, it was not uncommon for the game to be played in July. Since 2002, when the league permanently moved the start of the season to the weekend after Labor Day, the game has always been played in early August.\\r\\nThe 2011 game was originally scheduled between the St. Louis Rams and the Chicago Bears, but the game was canceled due to an ongoing labor dispute that had disrupted nearly all league activity during the 2011 offseason. The two clubs had set a deadline of July 22 to ratify a resolution in enough time to prepare for the game. The league and players did not ratify the agreement until July 25, forcing cancellation of the game.\\r\\nThe 2016 edition, which was scheduled to be played between the Green Bay Packers and the Indianapolis Colts, was canceled due to unsafe playing conditions. Mike Silver of NFL.com reported that on the morning of game day, the logos at midfield and the end zones had been painted using paint which was not intended for use on artificial turf. When it was apparent the paint wasn't drying fast enough, the field was heated to speed up the drying process, but this caused the turf's rubber to melt. These issues led to unfavorable play conditions. The affected areas were described as being slick and \\"like cement,\\" making it impossible to get decent footing. Stadium officials attempted to address this by applying a solvent, reportedly paint thinner, to the turf. A Packers employee noticed a label warning that this substance could result in burns when exposed to skin, and alerted others to the discovery. When officially cancelling the game, both the league and the Players Association cited safety concerns.[2][3][4]\\r\\nBoth teams were told at 6:40 p.m.--an hour and 20 minutes before kickoff--that the game was going to be canceled. However, fans in the stadium only learned of the pending cancellation via social media. No official announcement was made until just before the scheduled 8 p.m. kickoff.[5]\\r\\nOn December 28, 2016, the NFL announced that the 2017 edition of the game would be played on Thursday, August 3, 2017. The scheduling change makes the Hall of Fame Game the first event of the Hall of Fame Weekend. On February 23, 2017, it was announced the 2017 edition will be played between the Dallas Cowboys and the Arizona Cardinals.[6]\\r\\nUnlike the majority of NFL preseason games, which air on local networks, the Hall of Fame Game airs nationwide. From 1999 to 2005, the game was held on Monday night, televised as part of ABC's Monday Night Football package. It had previously been held typically on Saturday afternoons, except from 1963 to 1965 on Sunday afternoons, televised as part of ABC's Wide World of Sports package (still using the MNF crew). In 1998, the game was put in the MNF package, and played on a Saturday night, which served as a test run for the move to Monday night. Starting in 2006, it was moved to Sunday night, coinciding with the new NBC Sunday Night Football[7] television package. The 2007 game was telecast on NFL Network as NBC was intending to televise the China Bowl game in Beijing, China (a game which was postponed to 2009 and later canceled). The Hall of Fame Game has since bounced between both networks. The 2012 game aired on NFL Network due to NBC's coverage of the Summer Olympics. After a two-year absence, the game returned to NBC in 2013 and remained on the network until 2015. The 2016 game was scheduled to air on ESPN as it was to be played two days into the 2016 Summer Olympics but the game was canceled due to field conditions, it returned to NBC in 2017 and will remain on the network until 2019.\\r\\nWestwood One owns national radio rights; it is the only preseason game to air on a nationwide network. Each team's radio network is also allowed to broadcast the games (albeit usually with fewer affiliates since exhibition games are traditionally much lower priority to non-sports and non-flagship stations).\\r\\nIn 2007 and 2008, the game was broadcast live in both Ireland and the United Kingdom by Sky Sports. It was not shown in 2009 because of a dispute between Sky Sports and the NFL over TV rights. ESPN America (formerly North American Sports Network) broadcasts the game in the rest of Europe.\\r\\nFrom 1998 to 2005, the Global Television Network aired the game in Canada, simulcasting ABC; upon the move to Sunday night in 2006, the CTV Television Network aired the game until 2010. With CTV airing the 2012 Summer Olympics, TSN broadcast the Hall of Fame Game in 2012. Azteca 7 aired Spanish-language coverage of the Hall of Fame Game in Mexico from 1998 to 2005; the Game moved to Canal 5 in 2006 and aired on that station until 2010. Due to the cancellation of the 2011 Hall of Fame Game and Televisa's Summer Olympics coverage, the Hall of Fame Game moved to Televisa Deportes in 2012 and then to Galavision in 2013.\\r\\nTom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium is part of the Cleveland market, and is also within 75 miles of numerous other television markets in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania. As such, the NBC affiliates (and before them, the ABC affiliates) are within league requirements to blackout the game in the rare event the game does not sell out. Because the stadium only holds 22,375 fans (less than half the NFL's minimum requirements for its stadiums) and the Hall of Fame induction ceremonies bring large numbers of outside fans to Canton, the game has, to date, always sold out (several NFL teams, as well as the Super Bowl, have similarly enjoyed long sellout streaks).\\r\\nMost appearances ÿ 6: Pittsburgh Steelers (1963, 1964, 1983, 1998, 2007, and 2015) and Dallas Cowboys (1968, 1979, 1999, 2010, 2013, and 2017)\\r\\nMost wins ÿ 5: Washington Redskins (1965, 1975, 1989, 2004, and 2008)\\r\\nLongest active drought without Hall of Fame Game appearance ÿ 26 seasons: Detroit Lions (last appearance ÿ 1991); 25 seasons: New York Jets (last appearance ÿ 1992); 23 seasons: Atlanta Falcons and Los Angeles Chargers (last appearance ÿ 1994); 22 seasons: Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars (last appearance ÿ 1995)\\r\\nActive teams to have never made a Hall of Fame Game appearance ÿ Baltimore Ravens","input":"What is a nfl hall of fame game?"},{"output":"Ruchi Sanghvi","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nRuchi Sanghvi (born 20 January 1982) is an Indian computer engineer.

It develops from the mesoderm. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers),[1] ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood[2] or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.\\r\\nThe cells of connective tissue include fibroblasts, adipocytes, macrophages, mast cells and leucocytes.\\r\\nThe term \\"connective tissue\\" (in German, Bindegewebe) was introduced in 1830 by Johannes Peter Mller. The tissue was already recognized as a distinct class in the 18th century.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConnective tissue can be broadly subdivided into connective tissue proper, and special connective tissue.[5][6] Connective tissue proper consists of loose connective tissue and dense connective tissue (which is further subdivided into dense regular and dense irregular connective tissues.)[7] Loose and dense connective tissue are distinguished by the ratio of ground substance to fibrous tissue. Loose connective tissue has much more ground substance and a relative lack of fibrous tissue, while the reverse is true of dense connective tissue. Dense regular connective tissue, found in structures such as tendons and ligaments, is characterized by collagen fibers arranged in an orderly parallel fashion, giving it tensile strength in one direction. Dense irregular connective tissue provides strength in multiple directions by its dense bundles of fibers arranged in all directions.\\r\\nSpecial connective tissue consists of reticular connective tissue, adipose tissue, cartilage, bone, and blood.[8] Other kinds of connective tissues include fibrous, elastic, and lymphoid connective tissues.[9] New vascularised connective tissue that forms in the process of wound healing is termed granulation tissue.[10] Fibroblasts are the cells responsible for the production of some CT.\\r\\nType I collagen is present in many forms of connective tissue, and makes up about 25% of the total protein content of the mammalian body.[11]\\r\\nCharacteristics of CT:\\r\\nTypes of fibers:\\r\\nConnective tissue has a wide variety of functions that depend on the types of cells and the different classes of fibers involved. Loose and dense irregular connective tissue, formed mainly by fibroblasts and collagen fibers, have an important role in providing a medium for oxygen and nutrients to diffuse from capillaries to cells, and carbon dioxide and waste substances to diffuse from cells back into circulation. They also allow organs to resist stretching and tearing forces. Dense regular connective tissue, which forms organized structures, is a major functional component of tendons, ligaments and aponeuroses, and is also found in highly specialized organs such as the cornea.[14]:161 Elastic fibers, made from elastin and fibrillin, also provide resistance to stretch forces.[14]:171 They are found in the walls of large blood vessels and in certain ligaments, particularly in the ligamenta flava.[14]:173\\r\\nIn hematopoietic and lymphatic tissues, reticular fibers made by reticular cells provide the stromaor structural supportfor the parenchymaor functional partof the organ.[14]:171\\r\\nMesenchyme is a type of connective tissue found in developing organs of embryos that is capable of differentiation into all types of mature connective tissue.[15] Another type of relatively undifferentiated connective tissue is mucous connective tissue, found inside the umbilical cord.[14]:160\\r\\nVarious types of specialized tissues and cells are classified under the spectrum of connective tissue, and are as diverse as brown and white adipose tissue, blood, cartilage and bone.[14]:158 Cells of the immune system, such as macrophages, mast cells, plasma cells and eosinophils are found scattered in loose connective tissue, providing the ground for starting inflammatory and immune responses upon the detection of antigens.[14]:161\\r\\nThere are many types of connective tissue disorders, such as:\\r\\nFor microscopic viewing, most of the connective tissue staining-techniques, colour tissue fibers in contrasting shades.

Douglas of Illinois and President Franklin Pierce. The initial purpose of the KansasÿNebraska Act was to open up thousands of new farms and make feasible a Midwestern Transcontinental Railroad. The popular sovereignty clause of the law led pro- and anti-slavery elements to flood into Kansas with the goal of voting slavery up or down, resulting in Bleeding Kansas.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe availability of tens of millions of acres of excellent farmland in the area made it necessary to create a territorial infrastructure to allow settlement. Railroad interests were especially eager to start operations since they needed farmers as customers. Four previous attempts to pass legislation had failed. The solution was a bill proposed in January 1854 by Douglas: the Democratic Party leader in the US Senate, the chairman of the Committee on Territories, an avid promoter of railroads, an aspirant to the presidency, and a fervent believer in popular sovereignty: the policy of letting the voters, almost exclusively white males, of a territory decide whether or not slavery should exist in it.[2]\\r\\nSince the 1840s, the topic of a transcontinental railroad had been discussed. While there were debates over the specifics, especially the route to be taken, there was a public consensus that such a railroad should be built by private interests, financed by public land grants. In 1845, Douglas, serving in his first term in the US House of Representatives, had submitted an unsuccessful plan to organize the Nebraska Territory formally, as the first step in building a railroad with its eastern terminus in Chicago. Railroad proposals were debated in all subsequent sessions of Congress with cities such as Chicago, St. Louis, Quincy, Memphis, and New Orleans competing to be the jumping-off point for the construction.[3]\\r\\nSeveral proposals in late 1852 and early 1853 had strong support, but they failed because of disputes over whether the railroad would follow a northern or a southern route. In early 1853, the House of Representatives passed a bill 107 to 49 to organize the Nebraska Territory in the land west of Iowa and Missouri. In March, the bill moved to the Senate Committee on Territories, which was headed by Douglas. Missouri Senator David Atchison announced that he would support the Nebraska proposal only if slavery was allowed. While the bill was silent on this issue, slavery would have been prohibited, under the Missouri Compromise. Other Southern senators were as inflexible as Atchison. By a vote of 23 to 17, the Senate voted to table the motion, with every senator from the states south of Missouri voting to table.[4]\\r\\nDuring the Senate adjournment, the issues of the railroad and the repeal of the Missouri Compromise became entangled in Missouri politics, as Atchison campaigned for re-election against the forces of Thomas Hart Benton. Atchison was maneuvered into choosing between antagonizing the state's railroad interests or its slaveholders. Finally, Atchison took the position that he would rather see Nebraska \\"sink in hell\\" before he would allow it to be overrun by free soilers.[5]\\r\\nRepresentatives then generally found lodging in boarding houses when they were in the nation's capital to perform their legislative duties. Atchison shared lodgings in an F Street house, shared by the leading Southerners in Congress. Atchison himself was the Senate's president pro tempore. His housemates included Robert T. Hunter (from Virginia, chairman of the Finance Committee), James Mason (from Virginia, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee) and Andrew P. Butler (from South Carolina, chairman of the Judiciary Committee). When Congress reconvened on December 5, 1853, the group, termed the F Street Mess[6], along with Virginian William O. Goode, formed the nucleus that would insist on slaveholder equality in Nebraska. Douglas was aware of the group's opinions and power and knew that he needed to address its concerns.[7]\\r\\nIowa Senator Augustus C. Dodge immediately reintroduced the same legislation to organize Nebraska that had stalled in the previous session; it was referred to Douglas's committee on December 14. Douglas, hoping to achieve the support of the Southerners, publicly announced that the same principle that had been established in the Compromise of 1850 should apply in Nebraska.\\r\\nIn the Compromise of 1850, Utah and New Mexico Territories had been organized without any restrictions on slavery, and many supporters of Douglas argued that the compromise had already superseded the Missouri Compromise.[8] The two territories, however, unlike Nebraska, had not been part of the Louisiana Purchase and had never been subject to the Missouri Compromise.\\r\\nThe bill was reported to the main body of the Senate on January 4, 1854. It had been modified by Douglas, who had also authored the New Mexico Territory and Utah Territory Acts, to mirror the language from the Compromise of 1850. In the bill, a vast new Nebraska Territory was created to extend from Kansas north all the way to the 49th parallel, the USÿCanada border. A large portion of Nebraska Territory would soon be split off into Dakota Territory (1861), and smaller portions transferred to Colorado Territory (1861) and Idaho Territory (1863) before the balance of the land became the State of Nebraska in 1867.\\r\\nFurthermore, any decisions on slavery in the new lands were to be made \\"when admitted as a state or states, the said territory, or any portion of the same, shall be received into the Union, with or without slavery, as their constitution may prescribe at the time of their admission.\\"[10] In a report accompanying the bill, Douglas's committee wrote that the Utah and New Mexico Acts\\r\\n...were intended to have a far more comprehensive and enduring effect than the mere adjustment of the difficulties arising out of the recent acquisition of Mexican territory. They were designed to establish certain great principles, which would not only furnish adequate remedies for existing evils, but, in all time to come, avoid the perils of a similar agitation, by withdrawing the question of slavery from the halls of Congress and the political arena, and committing it to the arbitrament of those who were immediately interested in, and alone responsible for its consequences.[11]\\r\\nThe report compared the situation in New Mexico and Utah with the situation in Nebraska. In the first instance, many had argued that slavery had previously been prohibited under Mexican law, just as it was prohibited in Nebraska under the Missouri Compromise. Just as the creation of New Mexico and Utah territories had not ruled on the validity of Mexican law on the acquired territory, the Nebraska bill was neither \\"affirming or repealing... the Missouri act.\\" In other words, popular sovereignty was being established by ignoring, rather than addressing, the problem presented by the Missouri Compromise.[11]\\r\\nDouglas's attempt to finesse his way around the Missouri Compromise did not work. Kentucky Whig Archibald Dixon believed that unless the Missouri Compromise was explicitly repealed, slaveholders would be reluctant to move to the new territory until slavery was actually approved by the settlers, who would most likely oppose slavery. On January 16 Dixon surprised Douglas by introducing an amendment that would repeal the section of the Missouri Compromise that prohibited slavery north of the 3630' parallel. Douglas met privately with Dixon and in the end, despite his misgivings on Northern reaction, agreed to accept Dixon's arguments.[12]\\r\\nFrom a political standpoint, the Whig Party had been in decline in the South because of the effectiveness with which it had been hammered by the Democratic Party over slavery. The Southern Whigs hoped that by seizing the initiative on this issue, they would be identified as strong defenders of slavery. Many Northern Whigs broke with them in the Act. The party eventually died by the division over the issue.[13]\\r\\nA similar amendment was offered in the House by Philip Phillips of Alabama. With the encouragement of the \\"F Street Mess\\", Douglas met with them and Phillips to ensure that the momentum for passing the bill remained with the Democratic Party. They arranged to meet with President Franklin Pierce to ensure that the issue would be declared a test of party loyalty within the Democratic Party.[15]\\r\\nPierce had barely mentioned Nebraska in his State of the Union message the previous month and was not enthusiastic about the implications of repealing the Missouri Compromise. Close advisors Senator Lewis Cass, a proponent of popular sovereignty as far back as 1848 as an alternative to the Wilmot Proviso, and Secretary of State William L. Marcy both told Pierce that repeal would create serious political problems. The full cabinet met and only Secretary of War Jefferson Davis and Secretary of Navy James C. Dobbin supported repeal. Instead the president and cabinet submitted to Douglas an alternative plan that would have sought out a judicial ruling on the constitutionality of the Missouri Compromise. Both Pierce and Attorney General Caleb Cushing believed that the Supreme Court would find it unconstitutional.[16]\\r\\nDouglas's committee met later that night. Douglas was agreeable to the proposal, but the Atchison group was not. Determined to offer the repeal to Congress on January 23 but reluctant to act without Pierce's commitment, Douglas arranged through Davis to meet with Pierce on January 22 even though it was a Sunday, when Pierce generally refrained from conducting any business. Douglas was accompanied at the meeting by Atchison, Hunter, Phillips, and John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky.[17]\\r\\nDouglas and Atchison first met alone with Pierce before the whole group convened. Pierce was persuaded to support repeal, and at Douglas' insistence, Pierce provided a written draft, asserting that the Missouri Compromise had been made inoperative by the principles of the Compromise of 1850. Pierce later informed his cabinet, which concurred in the change of direction.[18] The Washington Union, the communications organ for the administration, wrote on January 24 that support for the bill would be \\"a test of Democratic orthodoxy.\\"[19]\\r\\nOn January 23, a revised bill was introduced in the Senate that repealed the Missouri Compromise and divided the territory into two territories: Kansas and Nebraska. The division was the result of concerns expressed by settlers already in Nebraska as well as the senators from Iowa, who were concerned with the location of the territory's seat of government if such a large territory were created. Existing language to affirm the application of all other laws of the United States in the new territory was supplemented by the language agreed on with Pierce: \\"except the eighth section of the act preparatory to the admission of Missouri into the Union, approved March 6, 1820, which was superseded by the legislation of 1850, commonly called the compromise measures, and is declared inoperative.\\" Identical legislation was soon introduced in the House.[20]\\r\\nHistorian Allan Nevins wrote that \\"two interconnected battles began to rage, one in Congress and one in the country at large: each fought with a pertinacity, bitterness, and rancor unknown even in Wilmot Proviso days.\\" In Congress, the freesoilers were at a distinct disadvantage. The Democrats held large majorities in each house, and Douglas, \\"a ferocious fighter, the fiercest, most ruthless, and most unscrupulous that Congress had perhaps ever known\\" led a tightly disciplined party. It was in the nation at large that the opponents of Nebraska hoped to achieve a moral victory. The New York Times, which had earlier supported Pierce, predicted that this would be the final straw for Northern supporters of the slavery forces and would \\"create a deep-seated, intense, and ineradicable hatred of the institution which will crush its political power, at all hazards, and at any cost.\\"[21]\\r\\nThe day after the bill was reintroduced, two Ohioans, Representative Joshua Giddings and Senator Salmon P. Chase, published a free-soil response, \\"Appeal of the Independent Democrats in Congress to the People of the United States:\\"\\r\\nWe arraign this bill as a gross violation of a sacred pledge; as a criminal betrayal of precious rights; as part and parcel of an atrocious plot to exclude from a vast unoccupied region immigrants from the Old World and free laborers from our own States, and convert it into a dreary region of despotism, inhabited by masters and slaves.[22]\\r\\nDouglas took the appeal personally and responded in Congress, when the debate was opened on January 30 before a full House and packed gallery. Douglas biographer Robert W. Johanssen described part of the speech:\\r\\nDouglas charged the authors of the \\"Appeal\\", whom he referred to throughout as the \\"Abolitionist confederates\\", with having perpetrated a \\"base falsehood\\" in their protest. He expressed his own sense of betrayal, recalling that Chase, \\"with a smiling face and the appearance of friendship\\", had appealed for a postponement of debate on the ground that he had not yet familiarized himself with the bill. \\"Little did I suppose at the time that I granted that act of courtesy,\\" Douglas remarked, that Chase and his compatriots had published a document \\"in which they arraigned me as having been guilty of a criminal betrayal of my trust,\\" of bad faith, and of plotting against the cause of free government. While other Senators were attending divine worship, they had been \\"assembled in a secret conclave\\", devoting the Sabbath to their own conspiratorial and deceitful purposes.[23]\\r\\nThe debate would continue for four months, as many Anti-Nebraska political rallies were held across the north. Douglas remained the main advocate for the bill while Chase, William Seward, of New York, and Charles Sumner, of Massachusetts, led the opposition. The New-York Tribune wrote on March 2:\\r\\nThe debate in the Senate concluded on March 4, 1854, when Douglas, beginning near midnight on March 3, made a five-and-a-half-hour speech. The final vote in favor of passage was 37 to 14.[27] Free-state senators voted 14 to 12 in favor, and slave-state senators supported the bill 23 to 2.[28]\\r\\nOn March 21, 1854, as a delaying tactic in the House of Representatives, the legislation was referred by a vote of 110 to 95 to the Committee of the Whole, where it was the last item on the calendar. Realizing from the vote to stall that the act faced an uphill struggle, the Pierce administration made it clear to all Democrats that passage of the bill was essential to the party and would dictate how federal patronage would be handled. Davis and Cushing, from Massachusetts, along with Douglas, spearheaded the partisan efforts.[29] By the end of April, Douglas believed that there were enough votes to pass the bill. The House leadership then began a series of roll call votes in which legislation ahead of the KansasÿNebraska Act was called to the floor and tabled without debate.[30]\\r\\nThomas Hart Benton was among those speaking forcefully against the measure. On April 25, in a House speech that biographer William Nisbet Chambers called \\"long, passionate, historical, [and] polemical,\\" Benton attacked the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, which he \\"had stood upon ... above thirty years, and intended to stand upon it to the endsolitary and alone, if need be; but preferring company.\\" The speech was distributed afterwards as a pamphlet when opposition to the act moved outside the walls of Congress.[31]\\r\\nIt was not until May 8 that the debate began in the House. The debate was even more intense than in the Senate. While it seemed to be a foregone conclusion that the bill would pass, the opponents went all out to fight it.[32] Historian Michael Morrison wrote:\\r\\nA filibuster led by Lewis D. Campbell, an Ohio free-soiler, nearly provoked the House into a war of more than words. Campbell, joined by other antislavery northerners, exchanged insults and invectives with southerners, neither side giving quarter. Weapons were brandished on the floor of the House. Finally, bumptiousness gave way to violence. Henry A. Edmundson, a Virginia Democrat, well oiled and well armed, had to be restrained from making a violent attack on Campbell. Only after the sergeant at arms arrested him, debate was cut off, and the House adjourned did the melee subside.[33]\\r\\nThe floor debate was handled by Alexander Stephens, of Georgia, who insisted that the Missouri Compromise had never been a true compromise but had been imposed on the South. He argued that the issue was whether republican principles, \\"that the citizens of every distinct community or State should have the right to govern themselves in their domestic matters as they please,\\" would be honored.[34]\\r\\nThe final vote in favor of the bill was 113 to 100.[35] Northern Democrats supported the bill 44 to 42, but all 45 northern Whigs opposed it. Southern Democrats voted in favor by 57 to 2, and southern Whigs supported it by 12 to 7.[36] Pierce signed the bill into law on May 30.\\r\\nThe immediate responses to the passing of the KansasÿNebraska Act fell into two classes. The less common response was held by Douglas's supporters, who believed that the bill would withdraw \\"the question of slavery from the halls of Congress and the political arena, committing it to the arbitration of those who were immediately interested in, and alone responsible for, its consequences.\\"[37] In other words, they believed that the Act would leave decisions about slavery in the hands of the people, rather than under the carefully-balanced jurisdiction of the Federal government. The far more common response was one of outrage, interpreting Douglas's actions as part of \\"an atrocious plot.\\"[38] Especially in the eyes of northerners, the KansasÿNebraska Act was aggression and an attack on the power and beliefs of free states.[39] The response led to calls for public action against the South, as seen in broadsides that advertised gatherings in northern states to discuss publicly what to do about the presumption of the Act.[40]\\r\\nBleeding Kansas, Bloody Kansas or the Border War was a series of violent political confrontations in the United States between 1854 and 1861 involving anti-slavery \\"Free-Staters\\" and pro-slavery \\"Border Ruffian\\", or \\"southern\\" elements in Kansas. At the heart of the conflict was the question of whether Kansas would allow or outlaw slavery, and thus enter the Union as a slave state or a free state.\\r\\nPro-slavery settlers came to Kansas mainly from neighboring Missouri. Their influence in territorial elections was often bolstered by resident Missourians who crossed into Kansas solely for the purpose of voting in such ballots. They formed groups such as the Blue Lodges and were dubbed border ruffians, a term coined by opponent and abolitionist Horace Greeley. Abolitionist settlers, known as \\"Jayhawkers,\\" moved from the East expressly to make Kansas a free state. A clash between the opposing sides was inevitable.[41]\\r\\nSuccessive territorial governors, usually sympathetic to slavery, attempted to maintain the peace. The territorial capital of Lecompton, the target of much agitation, became such a hostile environment for Free-Staters that they set up their own, unofficial legislature, at Topeka.[42]\\r\\nJohn Brown and his sons gained notoriety in the fight against slavery by murdering five pro-slavery farmers with a broadsword in the Pottawatomie massacre. Brown also helped defend a few dozen Free-State supporters from several hundred angry pro-slavery supporters at Osawatomie.[43]\\r\\nHostilities between the factions reached a state of low-intensity civil war, which was damaging to Pierce. The new Republican Party sought to capitalize on the scandal of Bleeding Kansas. Routine ballot-rigging and intimidation, practiced by both pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers, failed to deter the immigration of anti-slavery settlers, who eventually became the majority of the population.[44]\\r\\nPrior to the organization of the KansasÿNebraska territory in 1854, the Kansas and Nebraska Territories were consolidated as part of the Indian Territory. Throughout the 1830s, large-scale relocations of Native American tribes to the Indian Territory took place, with many Southeastern nations removed to present-day Oklahoma, a process ordered by the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and known as the Trail of Tears, and many Midwestern nations removed by way of treaty to present-day Kansas. Among the latter were the Shawnee,[45] Delaware,[46] Kickapoo,[47] Kaskaskia and Peoria,[48] Ioway,[49] and Miami.[50] The passing of the KansasÿNebraska Act came into direct conflict with the relocations. White American settlers from both the free-soil North and pro-slavery South flooded the Northern Indian Territory, hoping to influence the vote on slavery that would come following the admittance of Kansas and, to a lesser extent, Nebraska to the United States.\\r\\nIn order to avoid and/or alleviate the reservation-settlement problem, further treaty negotiations were attempted with the tribes of Kansas and Nebraska. In 1854 alone, the U.S. agreed to acquire lands in Kansas or Nebraska from several tribes including the Kickapoo,[51] Delaware,[52] Omaha,[53] Shawnee,[54] Otoe and Missouri,[55] Miami,[56] and Kaskaskia and Peoria.[57] In exchange for their land cessions, the tribes largely received small reservations in the Indian Territory of Oklahoma or Kansas in some cases.\\r\\nFor the nations that remained in Kansas beyond 1854, the KansasÿNebraska Act introduced a host of other problems. In 1855, white \\"squatters\\" built the city of Leavenworth on the Delaware reservation without the consent of either the Delaware or the US government. When Commissioner of Indian Affairs George Manypenny ordered for military support in removing the squatters, both the military and the squatters refused to comply, undermining both Federal authority and the treaties in place with the Delaware.[58] In addition to the violations of treaty agreements, other promises made were not being kept. Construction and infrastructure improvement projects dedicated in nearly every treaty, for example, took a great deal longer than expected. Beyond that, however, the most damaging violation by White American settlers was the mistreatment of Native Americans and their properties. Personal maltreatment, stolen property, and deforestation have all been cited.[59] Furthermore, the squatters' premature and illegal settlement of the Kansas Territory jeopardized the value of the land and, with it, the future of the Indian tribes living on them. Because treaties were land cessions and purchases, the value of the land handed over to the Federal government was critical to the payment received by a given Native nation. Deforestation, destruction of property, and other general injuries to the land lowered the value of the territories that were ceded by the Kansas Territory tribes.[60]\\r\\nManypenny's 1856 \\"Report on Indian Affairs\\" explained the devastating effect of diseases White settlers brought to Kansas on Indian populations. Without providing statistics, Indian Affairs Superintendent to the area Colonel Alfred Cumming reported at least more deaths than births in most tribes in the area. While noting intemperance, or alcoholism, as a leading cause of death, Cumming specifically cited cholera, smallpox, and measles, none of which the Native Americans were able to treat.[61] The disastrous epidemics exemplified the Osage people, who lost an estimated 1300 lives to scurvy, measles, smallpox, and scrofula between 1852 and 1856,[62] contributing, in part, to the massive decline in population, from 8000 in 1850 to just 3500 in 1860.[63] The Osage had already encountered epidemics associated with relocation and white settlement. The initial removal acts in the 1830s brought both White American settlers and foreign Native American tribes to the Great Plains and into contact with the Osage people. Between 1829 and 1843, influenza, cholera, and smallpox killed an estimated 1242 Osage Indians,[62] resulting in a population recession of roughly 20 percent between 1830 and 1850.[63]\\r\\nThough their role has been largely minimized or excluded in many historical accounts, Native Americans were also subjected to a great deal of violence during Bleeding Kansas. It has been argued that the widespread absence of Indian involvement in Bleeding Kansas and the settlement of Kansas as a whole from historical texts are caused by racism, an insistence that Native Americans are \\"half-civilized\\" and have \\"done nothing for the world,\\" Furthermore, it has also been argued that the dismissal of Native Americans, as civilized societies, removed White settlers from responsibility for their transgressions against Indian tribes in Kansas throughout Bleeding Kansas.[64]\\r\\nThe KansasÿNebraska Act divided the nation and pointed it toward civil war.[65] The Act itself virtually nullified the Missouri Compromise of 1820. The turmoil over the act split both the Democratic and Whig parties and gave rise to the Republican Party, which split the United States into two major political camps, the Republican North and the Democratic South.\\r\\nSenator Stephen A. Douglas and former Illinois Representative Abraham Lincoln aired their disagreement over the KansasÿNebraska Act in seven public speeches during September and October 1854.[66] Lincoln gave his most comprehensive argument against slavery and the provisions of the act in Peoria, Illinois, on October 16, the Peoria Speech.[67] He and Douglas both spoke to the large audience, Douglas first and Lincoln in response, two hours later. Lincoln's three-hour speech presented thorough moral, legal, and economic arguments against slavery and raised Lincoln's political profile for the first time. The speeches set the stage for the Lincoln-Douglas debates four years later, when Lincoln was running for Douglas's Senate seat.[68]\\r\\nA new anti-slavery state constitution, known as the Wyandotte Constitution, was eventually drawn up. On January 29, 1861, five weeks before Lincoln's inauguration, Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state. On March 1, 1867, Nebraska was admitted to the Union. By then, the 1861ÿ1865 Civil War had been fought, and slavery itself had been outlawed throughout the United States by the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution.","input":"Why did congress pass the kansas nebraska act?"},{"output":"The leone","context":"The leone is the currency of Sierra Leone.

It replaced the British West African pound at a rate of 1 pound = 2 leones (i.e., 1 leone = 10 shillings).[1]\\r\\nFor an earlier Sierra Leone currency, see Sierra Leonean dollar.\\r\\nIn 1964, decimal coins were introduced in denominations of ?, 1, 5, 10 and 20 cents. The coins size and compositions were based in part on those of the former colonial state British West Africa. All bore the portrait of the first president of Sierra Leone, Sir Milton Margai. In 1972, 50 cents coins were introduced which carried the portrait of the succeeding president Dr. Siaka Stevens.\\r\\nIn 1974, round cupro-nickel one leone coins were introduced and in 1976, seven sided cupro-nickel 2 leone coins commemorating FAO were introduced.

A new coin series was introduced in 1996 for 10, 50 and 100 leones. The 50 leones is octagonal while the other two are round. These coins were struck in nickel-plated steel and feature important figures in Sierra Leone's political history. Ten sided, bimetallic 500 leones coins were first introduced in 2004. Of the four coins in circulation, only the 100 leones is available in small quantity due to their low valuation and shortage of supply.\\r\\n500 leones coins and the two lowest denominations are rarely encountered due to rampant metal theft in the impoverished country.\\r\\nWith the introduction of decimal currency in 1964, a new series of Banknotes was introduced by the Bank of Sierra Leone. Originally called Shillings, the unit name \\"Leone\\" was finally decided upon. After considering (and subsequently rejecting) several new designs, including a particularly attractive multi-coloured design, notes were issued in the 1, 2 and 5 Leone denominations. These officially replaced notes of the British West African pound at a two leone to one pound exchange ratio. 50 cents notes were introduced in 1979, followed by 10 leones in 1980 and 20 leones notes in 1982. Throughout this period the value of the currency was fixed and remained relatively stable despite inherent economic problems.\\r\\n100 leones notes were introduced in 1988, followed by 500 leones in 1991, 1000 and 5000 leones in 1993, 2000 leones in the year 2000 and 10,000 Leone in 2004.\\r\\nThe original series of notes (1964-1974) depicted the famous 300 year old Cottonwood Tree and Court building in central Freetown.

The unit of frequency  cycle per second  was named the \\"hertz\\" in his honor.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHeinrich Rudolf Hertz was born in 1857 in Hamburg, then a sovereign state of the German Confederation, into a prosperous and cultured Hanseatic family. His father Gustav Ferdinand Hertz (originally named David Gustav Hertz) (1827ÿ1914) was a barrister and later a senator.[2] His mother was Anna Elisabeth Pfefferkorn.\\r\\nHertz's father converted from Judaism to Christianity[3][4] in 1834.[5] His mother's family was a Lutheran[6] pastor's family.\\r\\nWhile studying at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums in Hamburg, Hertz showed an aptitude for sciences as well as languages, learning Arabic and Sanskrit. He studied sciences and engineering in the German cities of Dresden, Munich and Berlin, where he studied under Gustav R. Kirchhoff and Hermann von Helmholtz. In 1880, Hertz obtained his PhD from the University of Berlin, and for the next three years remained for post-doctoral study under Helmholtz, serving as his assistant. In 1883, Hertz took a post as a lecturer in theoretical physics at the University of Kiel. In 1885, Hertz became a full professor at the University of Karlsruhe.\\r\\nIn 1886, Hertz married Elisabeth Doll, the daughter of Dr. Max Doll, a lecturer in geometry at Karlsruhe. They had two daughters: Johanna, born on 20 October 1887 and Mathilde, born on 14 January 1891, who went on to become a notable biologist. During this time Hertz conducted his landmark research into electromagnetic waves.\\r\\nHertz took a position of Professor of Physics and Director of the Physics Institute in Bonn on 3 April 1889, a position he held until January 1894. During this time he worked on theoretical mechanics with his work published in the book Die Prinzipien der Mechanik in neuem Zusammenhange dargestellt (The Principles of Mechanics Presented in a New Form), published posthumously in 1894.\\r\\nIn 1892, Hertz was diagnosed with an infection (after a bout of severe migraines) and underwent operations to treat the illness. He died of granulomatosis with polyangiitis at the age of 36 in Bonn, Germany in 1894, and was buried in the Ohlsdorf Cemetery in Hamburg.[7][8][9][10]\\r\\nHertz's wife, Elisabeth Hertz ne Doll (1864ÿ1941), did not remarry. Hertz left two daughters, Johanna (1887ÿ1967) and Mathilde (1891ÿ1975). Hertz's daughters never married and he has no descendants.[11]\\r\\nHertz always had a deep interest in meteorology, probably derived from his contacts with Wilhelm von Bezold (who was his professor in a laboratory course at the Munich Polytechnic in the summer of 1878). However, Hertz did not contribute much to the field himself except some early articles as an assistant to Helmholtz in Berlin, including research on the evaporation of liquids, a new kind of hygrometer, and a graphical means of determining the properties of moist air when subjected to adiabatic changes.[12]\\r\\nIn 1886ÿ1889, Hertz published two articles on what was to become known as the field of contact mechanics. Hertz is well known for his contributions to the field of electrodynamics (see below); however, most papers that look into the fundamental nature of contact cite his two papers as a source for some important ideas. Joseph Valentin Boussinesq published some critically important observations on Hertz's work, nevertheless establishing this work on contact mechanics to be of immense importance. His work basically summarises how two axi-symmetric objects placed in contact will behave under loading, he obtained results based upon the classical theory of elasticity and continuum mechanics. The most significant failure of his theory was the neglect of any nature of adhesion between the two solids, which proves to be important as the materials composing the solids start to assume high elasticity. It was natural to neglect adhesion in that age as there were no experimental methods of testing for it.\\r\\nTo develop his theory Hertz used his observation of elliptical Newton's rings formed upon placing a glass sphere upon a lens as the basis of assuming that the pressure exerted by the sphere follows an elliptical distribution. He used the formation of Newton's rings again while validating his theory with experiments in calculating the displacement which the sphere has into the lens. K. L. Johnson, K. Kendall and A. D. Roberts (JKR) used this theory as a basis while calculating the theoretical displacement or indentation depth in the presence of adhesion in 1971.[13] Hertz's theory is recovered from their formulation if the adhesion of the materials is assumed to be zero. Similar to this theory, however using different assumptions, B. V. Derjaguin, V. M. Muller and Y. P. Toporov published another theory in 1975, which came to be known as the DMT theory in the research community, which also recovered Hertz's formulations under the assumption of zero adhesion. This DMT theory proved to be rather premature and needed several revisions before it came to be accepted as another material contact theory in addition to the JKR theory. Both the DMT and the JKR theories form the basis of contact mechanics upon which all transition contact models are based and used in material parameter prediction in nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy. So Hertz's research from his days as a lecturer, preceding his great work on electromagnetism, which he himself considered with his characteristic soberness to be trivial, has come down to the age of nanotechnology.\\r\\nDuring Hertz's studies in 1879 Helmholtz suggested that Hertz's doctoral dissertation be on testing Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, published in 1865, which predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves moving at the speed of light, and predicted that light itself was just such a wave. Helmholtz had also proposed the \\"Berlin Prize\\" problem that year at the Prussian Academy of Sciences for anyone who could experimentally prove an electromagnetic effect in the polarization and depolarization of insulators, something predicted by Maxwell's theory.[15][16] Helmholtz was sure Hertz was the most likely candidate to win it.[16] Not seeing any way to build an apparatus to experimentally test this, Hertz thought it was too difficult, and worked on electromagnetic induction instead. Hertz did produce an analysis of Maxwell's equations during his time at Kiel, showing they did have more validity than the then prevalent \\"action at a distance\\" theories.[17]\\r\\nAfter Hertz received his professorship at Karlsruhe he was experimenting with a pair of Riess spirals in the autumn of 1886 when he noticed that discharging a Leyden jar into one of these coils would produce a spark in the other coil. With an idea on how to build an apparatus, Hertz now had a way proceed with the \\"Berlin Prize\\" problem of 1879 on proving Maxwell's theory (although the actual prize had expired uncollected in 1882).[18][19] He used a Ruhmkorff coil-driven spark gap and one-meter wire pair as a radiator. Capacity spheres were present at the ends for circuit resonance adjustments. His receiver was a simple half-wave dipole antenna with a micrometer spark gap between the elements. This experiment produced and received what are now called radio waves in the very high frequency range.\\r\\nBetween 1886 and 1889 Hertz would conduct a series of experiments that would prove the effects he was observing were results of Maxwell's predicted electromagnetic waves. Starting in November 1887 with his paper \\"On Electromagnetic Effects Produced by Electrical Disturbances in Insulators\\", Hertz would send a series of papers to Helmholtz at the Berlin Academy, including papers in 1888 that showed transverse free space electromagnetic waves traveling at a finite speed over a distance.[19][20] In the apparatus Hertz used, the electric and magnetic fields would radiate away from the wires as transverse waves. Hertz had positioned the oscillator about 12 meters from a zinc reflecting plate to produce standing waves. Each wave was about 4 meters long. Using the ring detector, he recorded how the wave's magnitude and component direction varied. Hertz measured Maxwell's waves and demonstrated that the velocity of these waves was equal to the velocity of light. The electric field intensity, polarization and reflection of the waves were also measured by Hertz. These experiments established that light and these waves were both a form of electromagnetic radiation obeying the Maxwell equations. Hertz also described the \\"Hertzian cone\\", a type of wave-front propagation through various media.\\r\\nHertz helped establish the photoelectric effect (which was later explained by Albert Einstein) when he noticed that a charged object loses its charge more readily when illuminated by ultraviolet radiation (UV). In 1887, he made observations of the photoelectric effect and of the production and reception of electromagnetic (EM) waves, published in the journal Annalen der Physik. His receiver consisted of a coil with a spark gap, whereby a spark would be seen upon detection of EM waves. He placed the apparatus in a darkened box to see the spark better. He observed that the maximum spark length was reduced when in the box. A glass panel placed between the source of EM waves and the receiver absorbed UV that assisted the electrons in jumping across the gap. When removed, the spark length would increase. He observed no decrease in spark length when he substituted quartz for glass, as quartz does not absorb UV radiation. Hertz concluded his months of investigation and reported the results obtained. He did not further pursue investigation of this effect, nor did he make any attempt at explaining how the observed phenomenon was brought about.\\r\\nHertz did not realize the practical importance of his radio wave experiments. He stated that,[22][23][24]\\r\\nAsked about the applications of his discoveries, Hertz replied,[22][25]\\r\\nHertz's proof of the existence of airborne electromagnetic waves led to an explosion of experimentation with this new form of electromagnetic radiation, which was called \\"Hertzian waves\\" until around 1910 when the term \\"radio waves\\" became current. Within 10 years researchers such as Oliver Lodge, Ferdinand Braun, and Guglielmo Marconi employed radio waves in the first wireless telegraphy radio communication systems, leading to radio broadcasting, and later television. Today radio is an essential technology in global telecommunication networks, and the transmission medium underlying modern wireless devices.\\r\\nIn 1892, Hertz began experimenting and demonstrated that cathode rays could penetrate very thin metal foil (such as aluminium). Philipp Lenard, a student of Heinrich Hertz, further researched this \\"ray effect\\". He developed a version of the cathode tube and studied the penetration by X-rays of various materials. Philipp Lenard, though, did not realize that he was producing X-rays. Hermann von Helmholtz formulated mathematical equations for X-rays. He postulated a dispersion theory before R?ntgen made his discovery and announcement. It was formed on the basis of the electromagnetic theory of light (Wiedmann's Annalen, Vol. XLVIII). However, he did not work with actual X-rays.\\r\\nHeinrich Hertz was a Lutheran throughout his life and would not have considered himself Jewish, as his father's family had all converted to Lutheranism[26] when his father was still in his childhood (aged seven) in 1834.[5]\\r\\nNevertheless, when the Nazi regime gained power decades after Hertz's death, his portrait was removed by them from its prominent position of honor in Hamburg's City Hall (Rathaus) because of his partly Jewish ethnic ancestry. (The painting has since been returned to public display.[27])\\r\\nHertz's widow and daughters left Germany in the 1930s and went to England.\\r\\nHeinrich Hertz's nephew Gustav Ludwig Hertz was a Nobel Prize winner, and Gustav's son Carl Helmut Hertz invented medical ultrasonography. His daughter Mathilde Carmen Hertz was a well-known biologist and comparative psychologist. Hertz's grandnephew Hermann Gerhard Hertz, professor at the University of Karlsruhe, was a pioneer of NMR-spectroscopy and in 1995 published Hertz's laboratory notes.[28]\\r\\nThe SI unit hertz (Hz) was established in his honor by the International Electrotechnical Commission in 1930 for frequency, an expression of the number of times that a repeated event occurs per second. It was adopted by the CGPM (Confrence gnrale des poids et mesures) in 1960, officially replacing the previous name, \\"cycles per second\\" (cps).\\r\\nIn 1928 the Heinrich-Hertz Institute for Oscillation Research was founded in Berlin. Today known as the Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich Hertz Institute, HHI.\\r\\nIn 1969 (East Germany), a Heinrich Hertz memorial medal[29] was cast. The IEEE Heinrich Hertz Medal, established in 1987, is \\"for outstanding achievements in Hertzian waves [...] presented annually to an individual for achievements which are theoretical or experimental in nature\\".\\r\\nA crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, just behind the eastern limb, is named in his honor.

India conducted a referendum in the state on 20 February 1948, in which the people voted overwhelmingly to join India.

She is moved into intensive care, while neonatal surgeon Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) is flown in by helicopter in case the baby has to be delivered prematurely. Robbins and Sloan argue over Torres's treatment; Robbins believes that Torres would not risk endangering the baby, but Sloan argues for saving Torres at all costs. The attending surgeons devise a treatment plan, led by trauma surgeon Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). As they do so, Torres dreams about the moments preceding the accident. Her dream self sings to Robbins, interspersed with shots of the hospital staff singing and dancing with their own partners. Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) suggests treating Torres with a high-risk but potentially effective cardiothoracic procedure she learned from her old mentor, Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). Her current mentor, Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), refuses to perform it, but when Torres's condition deteriorates and she is rushed back into surgery, Hunt agrees that Yang should attempt the procedure.\\r\\nWhen Torres again goes into cardiac arrest, Montgomery delivers her daughter at twenty-three weeks's gestation. The baby is initially unable to breathe, so with Sloan's support, Robbins steps in and is able to revive her. Across the operating room, Torres's condition begins to improve. Once the surgery is complete, the doctors deal with their own affairs; Sloan's former partner Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) commits to her new relationship with resident Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams); Lexie's sister (and series main character) Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo, primary series star) confesses that she was jealous of Torres's pregnancy, which prompts her husband Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) to promise that they will have a child together; Altman tells Yang that she can no longer teach her; Sloan and Robbins bond over their shared parenthood. Later, as Robbins keeps a vigil by Torres's bedside, the hallucinatory Torres is able to rouse her recovering self. As she regains consciousness, Torres accepts Robbins's proposal.\\r\\nSince Grey's Anatomy began, series creator Shonda Rhimes had planned to produce a musical episode. She first vocalized the idea during filming of the pilot episode, when the program was as yet untitled.[1] Rhimes felt that seasons six and seven were the right time for the crew to \\"try anything and everything [they had] always wanted to do,\\" and explained that she \\"finally [had] the right idea and the right talent to make [a musical episode] happen.\\"[2] Filming began seven and a half years after Rhimes initially raised the idea.[1] The episode was shot in approximately two weeks.[3] Though cast member Dempsey jokingly referred to the episode as Glee M.D.,[4] Rhimes intended for it to differ from other musical television episodes.[2] She called it the opposite of \\"Once More, with Feeling,\\" the \\"all-out, show-stopping,\\" musical episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, as she aimed to \\"do something that was musical without being a musical.\\"[2]\\r\\nRhimes said she had difficulty getting the network's permission. She added: \\"I begged the studio people. I begged the network people. I took these people to dinner and begged. I jumped out at these people in bathrooms and begged. And they all smiled politely but what they were clearly really thinking was, 'This woman is an idiot.'\\"[1] Rhimes also explains why it took so long to produce this episode:\\r\\nThe script was written by Rhimes in November 2010. She centered the episode around Ramirez's character, Callie, and stated that the storyline would have developed regardless of whether it involved musical performances.[2] Sara Ramirez used the opportunity to launch her career as a singer-songwriter; an alternate version of \\"The Story\\" is included on her debut EP, released four days prior to the episode's premiere.[5] The episode served to improve the relationship between Mark and Arizona. Capshaw assessed that, \\"The traumatic circumstance leads to them having a greater understanding of each other and then appreciation, and then need for each other and desire to be in each others lives. They come to care, I think, for one another.\\"[6]\\r\\nRhimes, executive producer Betsy Beers and director Tony Phelan selected songs that became famous through their use in Grey's Anatomy, and chose \\"the most iconic ones, the ones that best suited [their] singers, and the ones that made the most sense.\\"[2][7] The multiple cover versions include the program's theme tune, \\"Cosy in the Rocket\\" by Psapp.[4] The primary vocalists are cast members Ramirez, McKidd, Leigh and Chandra Wilson.[8] The soundtrack also includes \\"How to Save a Life\\" by The Fray and \\"Running on Sunshine\\" by Jesus Jackson, performed as ensemble pieces by Ramirez, McKidd, Wilson, Leigh, Daniel Sunjata, Scott Foley, Ellen Pompeo, Justin Chambers, Raver, Dane, and Capshaw.[7][9] Ramirez, McKidd and Wilson also perform together on Snow Patrol's \\"Chasing Cars.\\"[4] Ramirez is the lead vocalist on \\"The Story\\" by Brandi Carlile,[7] and \\"Grace\\" by Kate Havnevik, which also features the other female cast members, including Leigh and Sarah Drew on the chorus.[4][9] Capshaw duets with Ramirez on KT Tunstall's \\"Universe & U.\\"[7] Wilson is the lead vocalist on \\"Wait\\" by Get Set Go, McKidd on \\"How We Operate\\" by Gomez, and Leigh on Anna Nalick's \\"Breathe (2 AM).\\"[7][9]\\r\\nLeigh told that some actors were not \\"adamant and excited\\" about singing but still had the possibility to participate in the episode.[11] \\"There were certain ways in which the scenes were written, even if there was a song in there, that perhaps a line was spoken instead of sung,\\" she said.[11]\\r\\nA vocal coach was enlisted to help the cast.[10] Music director Chris Horvath was recruited to arrange the selected songs for the cast. The arrangements took around two months, with vocals recorded over four days in February 2011.[7][12] Horvath praised the cast's response to the episode, noting that only four performers had \\"serious vocal talent,\\" while some had \\"barely sung in the shower\\" before.[7] Those with professional singing experience include Ramirez, who won a Tony Award for her role in the musical Spamalot, and Wilson, who appeared in the Broadway production of Caroline, or Change.[7] Cast members's reactions toward the episode varied. Pompeo initially deemed the idea \\"crazy,\\" but rescinded her stance following the first read-through.[4] Recurring cast member Sunjata stated that singing was \\"a bit out of [his] comfort zone,\\" but found it an \\"interesting challenge,\\"[13] and McKidd deemed it \\"very exciting to do something that's completely out on a limb for the show.\\"[12]\\r\\nCritical response prior to broadcast was mixed. TVLine's Michael Ausiello assessed that the episode would \\"either be a show-stopping triumph or a spectacular failure,\\" with no possible middle ground.[14] William Keck of TV Guide initially had \\"serious doubts,\\" which were allayed by a visit to the set, during which he listened to the soundtrack. Keck likened it to the \\"much-beloved early seasons of Grey's, when music played a vital role on the show.\\"[4] Entertainment Weekly's Dan Snierson predicted heavy use of Auto Tune,[15] though fellow EW writer Jennifer Armstrong was optimistic that the episode would be a success, commenting: \\"I have faith. I like musicals, I like Grey's. I'm rooting for this to work.\\"[16]\\r\\nDuring its original broadcast, \\"Song Beneath the Song\\" was watched by an average of 13.09?million American viewers. It attained a 4.9/13 Nielsen rating/share in the 18ÿ49 demographic, making it the second highest-rated program of the night, behind only American Idol on the Fox network. The rating was the second highest of the seventh season until that point, and a 30 percent increase from the previous episode, \\"This is How We Do It,\\" which was watched by 2.4?million fewer viewers.[17]\\r\\nIn Canada, where the episode also aired on March 31, 2011, it was watched by 3.18?million viewers. Viewership again increased on \\"This is How We Do It,\\" which attained 2.63?million viewers. However, while the preceding episode was the most-viewed scripted show for the week of its original broadcast, \\"Song Beneath the Song\\" ranked second, behind The Big Bang Theory.[18][19]\\r\\nFollowing the first minutes of the drama, reactions on Twitter were mixed.[20] Nicole Golden from TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.5 stars out of 5.0. She found that \\"overall, the concept worked since music really has always played a big part in the show. Some songs were more appropriate and/or better performed than others, though.\\" She also wrote the concept worked in part because it was new but noted \\"the format would probably not have the same effect if used in future episodes.\\"[21] Even though Boston Herald's critic Mark Perigard was not a fan of the concept, saying \\"the Grey's Anatomy event proved how tricky it is for an established show, especially a drama, to pull off a musical episode,\\" he did like several actors's performances. He wrote: \\"Chandra Wilson and Chyler Leigh (whom I never have anything good to say about) delivered some impressive vocal work. Eric Dane did some of his best acting of his career last night as an anxious father-to-be terrified he would lose his best friend.\\"[22] Lyneka Little of The Wall Street Journal wrote, \\"If Glee and ER had a baby it would be tonights episode of the medical drama Greys Anatomy titled Song Beneath the Song.\\"[20] In his review of the episode Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote \\"Like Grey's Anatomy as a whole, some parts were unintentionally silly, others were surprisingly powerful, and it was rarely dull, at least.\\"[23]\\r\\nPatrick Dempsey admitted that the musical episode might not have been showrunner Shonda Rhimes's best idea. He explained: \\"It's very difficult to keep it fresh when you're doing 24 episodes a year. Shonda Rhimes has a lot of ideas, and she is in a position where she can take more chances. Sometimes that works, sometimes it does not. Last year we had the singing episode, which I think was a big mistake. But you have to try.\\"[24]\\r\\nIn 2011, the episode was ranked number 19 on the TV Guide Network special, 25 Biggest TV Blunders 2.[25] It was included in TV Guide's list \\"The Worst of 2011\\" saying, \\"Sara Ramirez has powerhouse pipes, but what this episode desperately needed was a better playlist.\\"[26] BuddyTV, however, ranked it number 43 on its list of 2011's 50 Best TV Episodes and it also appeared on Digital Spy's shortlist of \\"TV's Best Musical Episodes.\\"[27][28] Supervising Music Editor Jennifer Barak and Music Editors Carli Barber and Jessica Harrison were nominated in the Best Sound Editing: Short Form Musical in Television category at the 2012 Golden Reel Awards for their work on the episode.[29]\\r\\n[30]\\r\\nGrey's Anatomy: The Music Event debuted at number 24 on the Billboard 200, with 19,000 copies sold.[31] It reached number 2 on the U.S. Soundtracks chart, and was the number 5 Independent Album.[32] \\"The Story\\" entered the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart at number 69,[33] and the Canadian Hot 100 at 72.[34]","input":"What episode is the grey's anatomy musical?"},{"output":"from January 1976 to January 1979","context":"Donny & Marie is an American variety show which aired on ABC from January 1976 to January 1979.  The show starred brother-and-sister pop duo Donny and Marie Osmond. Donny had first become popular singing in a music group with his brothers, The Osmonds, and Marie was one of the youngest singers to reach #1 on the Billboard Country Music charts (with \\"Paper Roses\\", in 1973).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe siblings were offered a weekly show by ABC-TV President Fred Silverman after he saw the duo co-host a week on The Mike Douglas Show which followed their series of popular remakes of oldies, such as \\"I'm Leaving It All Up to You\\", \\"Morning Side of the Mountain\\" and \\"Make the World Go Away\\".  Donny and Marie (18 and 16 years old, respectively, when the program premiered) were the youngest entertainers in TV history to host their own variety show. A year later, The Keane Brothers would break this record.\\r\\n\\r\\nDonny & Marie was a Friday night show[1] that consisted of an ice skating number intro, comedy skits, followed by songs performed by the duo. The most famous song performed on the show was \\"I'm a Little Bit Country, I'm a Little Bit Rock and Roll\\", which formed the basis of a weekly segment (the \\"Concert Spot\\") in which Marie (\\"a little bit country\\") would trade off singing a country music song with Donny (\\"I'm a little bit rock and roll\\") singing a rock and roll song. Each episode concluded with a musical finale and a cascade of balloons from the ceiling, matched to the colors of the sets and costumes. Donny and Marie would then sing their trademark closing song which was written by Alan Osmond, \\"May Tomorrow Be a Perfect Day\\". Occasionally, the show would feature roughly 15-minute musical adaptations of famous feature films, such as Star Wars and The Wizard of Oz, with a mix of original cast members and celebrity guest stars (Paul Lynde was a regular in these sketches).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show was shown in the UK on Sunday afternoon on BBC1, where it was always billed as \\"The Osmonds\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show's popularity declined after it was revealed that teen heartthrob Donny was dating (and eventually married) fellow Utahn Debbie Glenn, therefore taking him 'off the market' of eligible bachelors. According to an edition of the VH1 series Behind the Music, many female viewers started to tune out at this point. The series also underwent a format change in the final season, eliminating segments such as the ice skaters and country/rock-n-roll segments in favor of more concert-style disco numbers. The show was also retitled The Osmond Family Show near the end, and was moved from the Friday night timeslot that it had occupied since its debut to Sunday night; the program increasingly featured members of Donny and Marie's family. The variety show genre as a whole, at the time, was in steep decline, and the success of Donny & Marie was somewhat of an aberration compared to the trends of television in the late 1970s (two of the last successful variety shows, The Sonny & Cher Show and The Carol Burnett Show, left the air in 1977 and 1978, respectively).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1980ÿ1981 TV season featured Marie with a Bob Mackie fashion make-over and starring in her own solo variety series on NBC called Marie, which was also produced at Silverman's behest and attempted to follow a similar format. It lasted seven episodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDonny and Marie teamed up again in 1998 to co-host Donny & Marie (also known as The Donny and Marie Hour and The Donny and Marie Show), a talk show that ran for two seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, the show was created by Sid & Marty Krofft and videotaped in Los Angeles at KTLA Studios (known as the Golden West Videotape Division, and now known as the Old Warner Brothers Studio), but creative control of the show was given to the Osmonds after a long battle, and Donny & Marie was moved to the Osmond Studios (known as the Osmond Entertainment Center) in Orem, Utah in November 1977.","input":"When did the donny and marie show air?"},{"output":"Oracle Arena in Oakland","context":"Chase Center is a multi-purpose arena under construction in the Mission Bay neighborhood of San Francisco that will mainly be used for basketball, becoming the new home of the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Warriors, who have been located in the San Francisco Bay Area since 1962, have played their home games at Oracle Arena in Oakland since 1971. The arena will open before the 2019ÿ20 NBA season begins, with groundbreaking having occurred during the 2016ÿ17 NBA season.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name of Chase Center was announced on January 28, 2016, as part of an agreement with JPMorgan Chase.[1][2][3] The planned location for the arena, which would house the Golden State Warriors, is in San Francisco[4] at Third St. and 16th St.[5] The location will have an overlook of the water. The arena will have multiple layers and floors and will have a seating capacity of 18,000 people. It will also include a multi-purpose area that includes a theater configuration with an entrance overlooking a newly built park. It will contain 580,000 square feet (54,000?m2) of office and lab space and have 100,000 square feet (9,300?m2) of retail space. There will also be a public plaza/recreation area designed by landscape architecture firm SWA Group that is 35,000 square feet.[6] The construction will include a parking facility of about 950 spaces and will be accessible to the public transportation around the area.[4] A new subway line is also under construction that will link the arena and the University of California, San Francisco to downtown hotels, convention centers and subway and commuter rail lines that serve the entire Bay Area. With a one-billion-dollar investment, Chase Center will anchor a district of 11 acres of restaurants, cafs, offices, public plazas and a new five-and-a-half-acre public waterfront park.[3]\\r\\nThe plan for building a new arena was announced on May 22, 2012, at a Golden State Warriors press conference at the proposed site, attended by then-San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, then-NBA Commissioner David Stern, California Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber, and Warriors staff and city officials.[7] A new privately financed, $500 million 17,000 to 19,000-seat arena was planned to be located on Pier 30-32 along the San Francisco Bay waterfront, situated between the San Francisco Ferry Building and AT&T Park.[8] A month after the proposal, the South Beach-Rincon-Mission Bay Neighborhood Association criticized the site and said that a second major league sport venue in the area would make it no longer \\"family friendly\\".[9] Former San Francisco mayor Art Agnos began speaking to dozens of community gatherings in opposition to the proposed arena, stating that the project was pushed by two out-of-town billionaires and would severely impact traffic and city views.[10] On December 30, 2013, a ballot proposition was submitted to the city titled the \\"Waterfront Height Limit Right to Vote Act\\".[11] The initiative made it onto the June 2014 ballot as Proposition B, and its passage would affect three major waterfront developments, including the proposed Warriors arena.[12]\\r\\nOn April 19, 2014, the Warriors abandoned plans for the pier site and purchased a 12-acre site owned by Salesforce.com at the Mission Bay neighborhood for an undisclosed amount. The arena project will be financed privately.[13] The architect for the project is MANICA Architecture and the current plan for Chase Center is to have it built by 2019 before the NBA season starts.[4] The plan for Chase Center to open earlier was pushed back multiple times due to many complaints about the location.[5] Construction on the arena began in January 2017.[4]\\r\\nIn April 2015, the Mission Bay site was opposed by the Mission Bay Alliance, which cited traffic, lack of parking, and use of space that could go to UCSF expansion among other things as their reasons for opposition. Their complaint is that Chase Center will be located near UCSF Benioff Childrens Hospital and will create more traffic. Others say that this area can be used to expand the campus of UCSF.[5] To avoid the plan to build Chase Center being voided, representatives of the project have been working to address these issues such as traffic and parking.[14]\\r\\nThe Golden State Warriors had the official groundbreaking ceremony for Chase Center on January 17, 2017.[15]\\r\\nIn addition, many people feel that creating a new stadium for the Warriors franchise is a bad idea because it is seen as a manifestation of the global phenomenon of gentrification.[16][17] Many who supported the Warriors throughout their years at Oracle Arena feel betrayed by the decision to switch to this new San Francisco based location. As Marcus Thompson wrote, \\"For 50 years, Oakland has embraced the Warriors. This city was the refuge back when San Francisco did not support the Warriors and then-owner Franklin Mieuli was ready to bounce to San Diego. This region, with its rough edges and bent on loyalty, made the Warriors relevant when the franchise wasnt shiny enough to attract San Franciscos wealth. Oakland made the Warriors. The East Bay made the Warriors.\\"[18] There is also the issue of public costs associated with the new stadium, both in San Francisco[19][20] and Oakland.[21]\\r\\nIn the 2018 San Francisco elections, Proposition I was placed on the ballot as \\"an initiative to discourage the relocation of established sports teams\\"[22] in direct response to the proposed move of the Warriors from Oakland to San Francisco.[23][24] Though meant to block the move, the terms of this proposed law were non-binding.[25] Proposition I was defeated on June 5, 2018[26] after receiving over 59,000 votes.[27]","input":"Where is the golden state warriors arena located?"},{"output":"non-ferrous materials","context":"Plaster mold casting is a metalworking casting process similar to sand casting except the molding material is plaster of Paris instead of sand. Like sand casting, plaster mold casting is an expendable mold process, however it can only be used with non-ferrous materials. It is used for castings as small as 30?g (1?oz) to as large as 45?kg (99?lb). Generally, the form takes less than a week to prepare. Production rates of 1ÿ10?units/hr can be achieved with plaster molds.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nParts that are typically made by plaster casting are lock components, gears, valves, fittings, tooling, and ornaments.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plaster is not pure plaster of Paris, but rather has additives to improve green strength, dry strength, permeability, and castability. For instance, talc or magnesium oxide are added to prevent cracking and reduce setting time; lime and cement limit expansion during baking; glass fibers increase strength; sand can be used as a filler.[1] The ratio of ingredients is 70ÿ80% gypsum and 20ÿ30% additives.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pattern is usually made from metal, however rubber molds may be used for complex geometry; these molds are called Rubber plaster molds. For example, if the casting includes reentrant angles or complex angular surfaces then the rubber is flexible enough to be removed, unlike metal.[1] These molds are also inexpensive, reusable, more accurate than steel molds, fast to produce, and easy to change.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nTypical tolerances are 0.1?mm (0.0039?in) for the first 50?mm (2.0?in) and 0.02?mm per additional centimeter (0.002?in per additional inch). A draft of 0.5 to 1 degree is required. Standard surface finishes that are attainable are 1.3 to 4 micrometers (50ÿ125 in).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, the plaster is mixed and the pattern is sprayed with a thin film of parting compound to prevent the plaster from sticking to the pattern. The plaster is then poured over the pattern and the unit shaken so that the plaster fills any small features. The plaster sets, usually in about 15 minutes, and the pattern is removed. The mold is then baked, between 120?C (248?F) and 260?C (500?F), to remove any excess water. The dried mold is then assembled, preheated, and the metal poured. Finally, after the metal has solidified, the plaster is broken from the cast part. The used plaster cannot be reused.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaster mold casting is used when an excellent surface finish and good dimensional accuracy is required. Because the plaster has a low thermal conductivity and heat capacity, the metal cools more slowly than in a sand mold, which allows the metal to fill thin cross-sections; the minimum possible cross-section is 0.6?mm (0.024?in). This results in a near net shape casting, which can be a cost advantage on complex parts.[1] It also produces minimal scrap material.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major disadvantage of the process is that it can only be used with lower melting temperature non-ferrous materials, such as aluminium, magnesium, and zinc. The most commonly used materials is aluminium. The maximum working temperature of plaster is 1,200?C (2,200?F), so higher melting temperature materials would melt the plaster mold. Also, the sulfur in the gypsum reacts with iron, making it unsuitable for casting ferrous materials.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother disadvantage is that its long cooling times restrict production volume.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaster is not as stable as sand, so it is dependent on several factors, including the consistency of the plaster composition, pouring procedures, and curing techniques. If these factors are not closely monitored the mold can be distorted, shrink upon drying, have a poor surface finish, or fail completely.[4]","input":"What can you cast in a plaster mold?"},{"output":"Timothy Donald Cook","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nTimothy Donald Cook (born November 1, 1960)[3] is an American business executive and industrial engineer. Cook is the Chief Executive Officer of Apple Inc., and previously served as the company's Chief Operating Officer under its founder Steve Jobs.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nCook joined Apple in March 1998 as a senior vice president for worldwide operations, and then served as the Executive Vice President for worldwide sales and operations.[5] He was made the Chief Executive on August 24, 2011, prior to Jobs' death in October of that year.[6] During his tenure as the Chief Executive, he has advocated for the political reformation of international and domestic surveillance, cybersecurity, corporate taxation, American manufacturing, and environmental preservation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, Cook became the first Chief Executive of a Fortune 500 company to publicly come out as gay.[7] Cook also serves on the boards of directors of Nike, Inc.,[6] the National Football Foundation,[8] and is a trustee of Duke University.[9] In March 2015, he said he planned to donate his entire stock fortune to charity.[10] The research published at the University of Oxford characterized Cook's leadership style as paradigmatic of founder centrism: explained as a founder's mindset, an ethical disposition towards the shareholder collective, and an intense focus on exponential value creation.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nCook was born in Mobile, Alabama, United States.[12] He was baptized in a Baptist church[13] and grew up in nearby Robertsdale. His father, Donald, was a shipyard worker, and his mother, Geraldine, worked at a pharmacy.[12][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nCook graduated from Robertsdale High School. He earned a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in industrial engineering from Auburn University in 1982,[15] and his Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business in 1988.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter graduating from Auburn University in 1982, Cook spent 12 years in IBM's personal computer business, ultimately serving as the director of North American fulfillment.[5] It was during this time that Cook also earned his MBA from Duke University, becoming a Fuqua Scholar in 1988. Later, he served as the Chief Operating Officer of the computer reseller division of Intelligent Electronics, and in 1997 became the Vice President for Corporate Materials at Compaq for six months.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, Steve Jobs asked Tim Cook to join Apple. In a commencement speech at Auburn University, Cook said he decided to join Apple after meeting Jobs for the first time:\\r\\n\\r\\nAny purely rational consideration of cost and benefits lined up in Compaq's favor, and the people who knew me best advised me to stay at Compaq... On that day in early 1998 I listened to my intuition, not the left side of my brain or for that matter even the people who knew me best... no more than five minutes into my initial interview with Steve, I wanted to throw caution and logic to the wind and join Apple. My intuition already knew that joining Apple was a once in a lifetime opportunity to work for the creative genius, and to be on the executive team that could resurrect a great American company.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis first position was Senior Vice President for worldwide operations.[5] In relation to the role, Cook was quoted as saying: \\"You kind of want to manage it like you're in the dairy business. If it gets past its freshness date, you have a problem\\".[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nCook closed factories and warehouses, and replaced them with contract manufacturers; this resulted in a reduction of the company's inventory from months to days. Predicting its importance, his group invested in long-term deals such as advance investment in flash memory from 2005 onward, guaranteeing stable supply of what became a key iPod Nano, then iPhone and iPad component. Competitors at Hewlett-Packard, describing their cancelled TouchPad tablet computer, later said that it was made from \\"cast-off reject iPad parts\\".[20] Cook's actions were credited with keeping costs under control and, combined with the company's design and marketing savvy, generated huge profits.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2007, Cook was promoted to lead operations[22] and served as Chief Executive in 2009, while Jobs was away on a leave of absence for health related issues. In January 2011, Apple's board of directors approved a third medical leave of absence requested by Jobs. During that time, Cook was responsible for most of Apple's day-to-day operations, while Jobs made most major decisions.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Jobs resigned as CEO and became chairman of the board, Cook was named the new Chief Executive Officer of Apple Inc. on August 24, 2011.[25][26] Six weeks later, on October 5, 2011, Jobs died due to complications from pancreatic cancer.[27] Forbes contributor Robin Ferracone wrote in September 2011: \\"Jobs and Cook proceeded to forge a strong partnership, and rescued the company from its death spiral, which took it from $11 billion in revenue in 1995 down to less than $6 billion in 1998 ... Under their leadership, the company went from its nadir to a remarkable $100 billion today\\".[24][better?source?needed] In April 2012, Time included Cook on its annual \\"100 Most Influential People in the World\\" list.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 29, 2012, Cook made major changes to the company's executive team. Scott Forstall resigned as senior vice president of iOS, and became an advisor to Cook until he eventually departed from the company in 2013. John Browett, who was Senior VP of retail, was dismissed six months after he commenced at Apple, when he received 100,000 shares worth US$60 million.[29] Forstall's duties were divided among four other Apple executives: design SVP Sir Jonathan Ive assumed leadership of Apple's human interface team; Craig Federighi became the new head of iOS software engineering; services chief Eddy Cue became responsible for Maps and Siri; and Bob Mansfield, previously SVP of hardware engineering, became the head of a new technology group.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nCook's executive changes occurred after the third quarter of the fiscal year, when revenues and profits grew less than predicted.[31] One commentator said that Forstall was forced to step down, as Cook \\"decided to lance the boil as internal politics and dissent reached a key pitch\\". Since becoming CEO, Cook focused upon building a harmonious culture that meant \\"weeding out people with disagreeable personalitiespeople Jobs tolerated and even held close, like Forstall\\";[32][better?source?needed] although, another journalist said that \\"Apple's ability to innovate came from tension and disagreement.\\"[33] On February 28, 2014, Cook made headlines when he challenged shareholders to \\"get out of the stock\\" if they didn't share the company's views on sustainability and climate change.[34] In May 2016, Cook traveled to China to meet with government officials there after the closure of Apple's online iTunes Store and iBooks store by the Chinese government.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, some analysts compared Cook to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, claiming that innovation had died down since he replaced Jobs, similar to when Ballmer became Microsoft CEO in 2000.[36][37] In December 2017, Cook was a speaker at the World Internet Conference in China, where he stated that \\"the theme of this conferencedeveloping a digital economy for openness and shared benefitsis a vision we at Apple share. We are proud to have worked alongside many of our partners in China to help build a community that will join a common future in cyberspace.\\"[38][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlongside Google vice-president Vint Cerf and AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, Cook attended a closed-door summit held by President Barack Obama, on August 8, 2013, in regard to government surveillance and the Internet in the wake of the Edward Snowden NSA incident.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the December 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, in which 14 people were killed by Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, the Federal Bureau of Investigation solicited Apple to assist in \\"unlock[ing]\\" an iPhone 5C used by Farook.[42] On February 16, 2016, in response to a request by the Department of Justice, a federal magistrate judge ordered Apple to create a custom iOS firmware version that would allow investigators to circumvent the phone's security features.[43] Cook responded in an open letter, wherein he denounced the government's demands as constituting a \\"breach of privacy\\" with \\"chilling\\" consequences.[42][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Apple Inc. CEO, Cook regularly begins sending emails at 4:30?a.m. and previously held Sunday-night staff meetings by telephone to prepare for the next week.[19] Cook shared in May 2013 that his leadership focused on people, strategy, and execution; he explained, \\"If you get those three right the world is a great place.\\"[45] Under Cook's leadership, Apple has increased its donations to charity, and in 2013, he hired Lisa Jackson, formerly the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, to assist Apple with the development of its renewable energy activities.[46][47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 2008 election cycle, Cook donated to Barack Obama's first White House election.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it had been reported in early 2011 that Cook was gay,[50][51] at the time, and prior to his Oct. 2014 public statement, Cook chose to keep his personal life private.[52] He did publicly support LGBT rights.[53] In October 2014, the Alabama Academy of Honor inducted Cook, who spoke about his home state's record of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights.[54] The Academy of Honor is the highest honor Alabama gives its citizens.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, Cook donated to Democratic senators Chuck Schumer and Patrick Leahy for their stances on eBook pricing and surveillance reform, respectively.[56] During the same election cycle he hosted a fundraiser for Senator Rob Portman.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early March 2016, he donated to the election campaign of Democratic representative Zoe Lofgren of California. In early June, Cook hosted a private fundraiser along with Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Paul Ryan, described by Politico as \\"a joint fundraising committee aimed at helping to elect other House Republicans\\".[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2016 election, Cook raised funds for the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.[57] At one point, Clinton's campaign considered Cook as a candidate for vice-president.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2017 at Bloomberg's Global Business Forum, Cook defended the DACA immigration program. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the direction of Donald Trump's administration, stating: \\"This is unacceptable. This is not who we are as a country. I am personally shocked that there is even a discussion of this.\\"[59][60]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2018, Cook met with Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nCook is a fitness enthusiast and enjoys hiking, cycling, and going to the gym. Cook is known for being mostly solitary. He uses an off-campus fitness center for privacy, and very little is known about his personal life. He explained in October 2014 that he has sought to achieve a \\"basic level of privacy\\".[19][48] Cook was misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1996, an incident he said made him \\"see the world in a different way\\". He has since taken part in charity fundraising, such as cycle races to raise money for the disease. Cook later told an Auburn alumni magazine that his symptoms came from \\"lugging a lot of incredibly heavy luggage around\\".[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, Cook said that he offered a portion of his liver to Jobs, since both share a rare blood type. Cook claims that Jobs responded by yelling, \\"I'll never let you do that. I'll never do that.\\"[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile delivering the 2010 commencement speech at Auburn University, Cook emphasized the importance of intuition during significant decision-making processes in his life, and further explained that preparation and hard work are also necessary to execute on intuition.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 30, 2014, Cook came out as gay and stated in an editorial for Bloomberg Business, \\"I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.\\"[65] Cook also explained that he has been open about his sexuality \\"for years\\" and, while many people at Apple were aware of his sexual orientation, he sought to focus on Apple's products and customers rather than his personal life. He ended the article by saying \\"We pave the sunlit path toward justice together, brick by brick. This is my brick.\\"[65] As a result, Cook became the first openly gay CEO on the Fortune 500 list. In September 2015, Cook appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert; when asked about what inspired him to publicly reveal his sexual orientation, he responded, \\"Where I valued my privacy significantly, I felt that I was valuing it too far above what I could do for other people, so I wanted to tell everyone my truth.\\"[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Fortune, Cook has Apple stock worth about $120 million and options with a value of $665 million. In March 2015, he said he planned to donate his entire stock fortune to charity.[67][68]","input":"Who is the chief executive officer of apple?"},{"output":"Mahathir Mohamad","context":"Najib Razak\\r\\nBarisan Nasional\\r\\nMahathir Mohammad\\r\\nPakatan Harapan\\r\\nThe 14th Malaysian general election (GE14 or PRU14, acronym in Malay: Pilihan Raya Umum ke-14) was held on 9 May 2018 to elect members of the 14th Parliament of Malaysia.[2] At stake are all 222 seats in the Dewan Rakyat and 505 seats in 12 out of 13 state legislative assemblies. The 13th Parliament of Malaysia was dissolved on 7 April 2018. It would have been automatically dissolved on 24 June 2018, five years after the first meeting of the first session of the 13th Parliament of Malaysia on 24 June 2013.[3]\\r\\nThe Constitution of Malaysia requires a general election to be held in the fifth calendar year unless it is dissolved earlier by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong due to a motion of no-confidence or at the request of the Prime Minister.\\r\\nPakatan Harapan, the main opposition coalition in the Malaysian Parliament, won 113 seats in the Dewan Rakyat, Malaysia's lower house of parliament. The Sabah Heritage Party, which won another 8 seats, informally aligned itself with Pakatan Harapan, giving the opposition alliance a total of 121 seats in the new Parliament, enough to form a government.[4][5]\\r\\nThis marked a historic defeat for the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, which had been the governing party of Malaysia and its predecessor state, Malaya, since the country's independence in 1957. This makes Mahathir Mohamad the next Prime Minister of Malaysia and, at 92 years old, the oldest head of government in the world, although he has indicated he would give way within a few years to jailed opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim after seeking a royal pardon for him.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key dates are listed below in Malaysia Standard Time (GMT+8):\\r\\nThe Dewan Rakyat is made up of 222 members of parliament, elected for a five-year term; these seats are distributed between the thirteen Malaysian states in proportion to the states' voting population. Members are elected from single-member constituencies that each elects one representative to the Dewan Rakyat using the first-past-the-post voting system. If one party obtains a majority of seats, then that party is entitled to form the Government, with its leader as Prime Minister. If the election results in no single party having a majority, there is a hung parliament. In this case, the options for forming the Government are either a minority government or a coalition. Malaysia does not practice compulsory voting and automatic voter registration. The voting age is above 21[15][16] although the age of majority in the country is 18.[17]\\r\\nThe redistricting of electoral boundaries for the entire country had been presented to and passed by the Dewan Rakyat, and subsequently gazetted on 29 March 2018 after obtaining the royal consent of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong ahead of the 14th general election.[18] Elections are conducted by the Election Commission of Malaysia (EC), which is under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Department.\\r\\nWhile any state may dissolve its assembly independently of the Federal Parliament, the traditional practice is for most state assemblies to be dissolved at the same time as Parliament. In accordance with Malaysian law, the parliament as well as the legislative assemblies of each state (Dewan Undangan Negeri) would automatically dissolve on the fifth anniversary of the first sitting, and elections must be held within sixty days of the dissolution, unless dissolved prior to that date by their respective Heads of State on the advice of their Heads of Government.\\r\\nBelow are the dates of which the legislative assembly of each state dissolved:\\r\\nThe Sarawak State Legislative Assembly was not dissolved as the last election was held in 2016 and the term of the state assembly is due to end in 2022.\\r\\nAltogether 53 parties were eligible to contest in the election and get on the ballot and can therefore elect a representative in the Dewan Rakyat.[29] Furthermore, there are several independent candidates running for a single-member constituency.\\r\\nThe leader of the party commanding a majority of support in the Dewan Rakyat is the person who is called on by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to form a government as Prime Minister, while the leader of the largest party not in government becomes the Leader of the Opposition.\\r\\nThe table below lists parties which were represented in the 13th Dewan Rakyat.\\r\\nThe previous General Election witnessed 133 governmental seats and 89 non-governmental seats filled the Dewan Rakyat. The government side has 44 safe seats and 34 fairly safe seats, while the other side has 33 safe seats and 18 fairly safe seats.\\r\\nNewspapers, organisations and individuals have endorsed parties or individual candidates for the election.\\r\\nBefore the campaign, there were no limits to what a political party, candidate, or third party (corporations, unions, special interest groups, etc.) can spend: spending rules are only in force after the writs have been dropped and the campaign has begun. Malaysian election law set election spending limit at RM200,000 for each parliamentary candidate and half of the latter for each state legislature candidate.[31]\\r\\nElection Commission chairman Mohd. Hashim Abdullah announced that it is spending RM500?million for this General Election,[2] RM100?million more than the previous one.\\r\\nPart of the spendings were spend on indelible ink which cost about RM4.8?million for a total of 100,000 bottles of 60mL ink imported from Mysore Paints and Varnish Limited in India.[32]\\r\\nThe Election Commission (EC) has invited 14 countries to participate in the polls as foreign observers, comprising representatives of election management bodies from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Commonwealth of Nations, Asian and European countries as well as a study and support centre for the Malaysian Commonwealth Studies Centre based in Cambridge, United Kingdom. Seven countries agreed to send representatives to observe the elections, namely Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Maldives, Thailand and Timor-Leste.[33] The invitation was also extended to India, Pakistan and Uzbekistan of which nine countries observers arrived on 7 May.[34] The EC also appointed 1,236 election observers from 14 local non-governmental organisations.[35]\\r\\nAll 222 parliamentary seats (and 505 seats of 12 state legislative assemblies) were contested in this General Election.

On the following day, six Sabah BN assemblymen, four from UMNO and two from UPKO, announced that they had defected to Warisan.[45] This resulted in Barisan not having enough seats to form the state government, thus giving Warisan, along with Pakatan Harapan, the needed mandate to form the new Sabah state government.[46] Warisan president, Shafie Apdal, was later sworn in as the new Sabah Chief Minister the day after.[47] On the same day, a second Sabah-based Barisan component party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), announced that they will also leave the coalition due to poor performance in the election, not winning a single seat they contested in.[48]\\r\\nThe following day afterwards, two Sabah-based Barisan component party, the United Sabah People's Party (PBRS) and the United Sabah Party (PBS), announced that they will also leave Barisan. PBRS stated that they will apply for membership in the ruling party coalition, Pakatan Harapan,[49] while PBS stated that they will form a new Sabah-based coalition, compromising of all Sabah BN parties.[50]\\r\\nOn the same day, 3 Johor BN assemblymen announced that they have defected to PPBM, giving Pakatan a two-thirds majority in the Johor State Legislative Assembly,[51] while 2 Perak BN assemblymen announced that they will support Pakatan in forming the new Perak state government, while maintaining their allegiance with Barisan, giving Pakatan the needed mandate to form the state government in Perak, ending the hung parliament status-quo.[52] This resulted in both assemblymen having their UMNO membership dropped, thus becoming independents.[53] Perak Pakatan chairman, Ahmad Faizal Azumu, was later sworn in as the new Perak Menteri Besar.[54] Subsequently, two independent MPs, Jugah Muyang, who won in Lubok Antu, and Larry Sng Wei Shien, who won in Julau, announced that they have joined PKR.[55] Jugah Muyang won in a three-cornered fight against both Barisan and PKR, while the latter was endorsed by Pakatan against the BN candidate.[56]\\r\\nOn 13 May, a third independent MP, Prabakaran Parameswaran, who won in the constituency of Batu, announced that he would also join PKR, increasing Pakatan's total tally in the Dewan Rakyat to 124.[57] He was endorsed by PKR during the election after PKR's original candidate, Tian Chua, was disqualified from contesting due to a RM2,000 fine.[58]\\r\\nOn 14 May, a Perak BN assemblyman, Zainol Fadzi Paharudin, who had his UMNO membership dropped for supporting Pakatan in forming the state government, announced that he has joined PPBM,[59] giving Pakatan 30 seats in the Perak State Legislative Assembly, enough for a simple majority.\\r\\nAfter facing a defeat in the election, losing nearly a third of its seat in the Dewan Rakyat, former Prime Minister Najib Razak announced his resignation as president of UMNO and chairman of Barisan Nasional on 12 May.[60] Party deputy president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi took over the role as president of UMNO and chairman of Barisan Nasional, while vice-president Hishammuddin Hussein took over the duties of deputy president and deputy chairman of Barisan.[61]\\r\\nThere had been many controversies before the general election began, mostly regarding gerrymandering and electoral boundary re-delineations in favour of the ruling party. The body regulating elections in Malaysia, the Electoral Commission (which is under the control of the Prime Minister's Department) has been criticised by Bersih, Human Rights Commission of Malaysia and other organisations for electoral malpractices, arbitrary decisions and a lack of transparency.[62][63][64]\\r\\nOpposition parties, non-governmental organisations and even politicians from the ruling party have accused the government of gerrymandering, manipulating the composition of electoral seats in favour of Barisan Nasional.[65] The opposition claims that the manipulation primarily involves merging opposition-dominated areas into large, single seats and dividing BN-favouring areas among several, smaller seats so as to favour rural voters who are more inclined to support the ruling party.[66] An analyst with electoral reform group Tindak Malaysia estimates that this latest redelineation process would allow Barisan Nasional to regain control with just 33% of the vote.[67]\\r\\nThe Electoral Integrity Project (EIP), an independent academic project based at Harvard University and the University of Sydney that studies election integrity and assigns PEI scores (Global Perceptions of Electoral Integrity) to countries across the world, had in its most recent research paper published in November 2017, determined and ranked Malaysia's election integrity at 142nd out of 158 countries, just above Zimbabwe (143th), Vietnam (147th) and Afghanistan (150th).[68]\\r\\nSome of Malaysians protested the EC's decision to set Polling Day on midweek (Wednesday, 9 May) rather than to set it on weekend (i.e. Saturday) as it had been in the previous General Elections. Some of them, including Pakatan Harapan chairman Mahathir Mohamad,[69] PAS deputy president Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man[70] and Bersih chairperson Maria Chin,[71] viewed such decision to be unfair, undemocratic, and an attempt to discourage people overseas or interstate from returning to their hometowns to vote.[72]\\r\\nSince the 2013 elections, overseas voting has been open to the majority of Malaysian registered voters living abroad[73]. However, registered overseas Malaysian voters were reported to have received their ballots late, some even on election day, despite the election commission requiring their ballots to be returned before the close of polling stations to be counted as valid.[74] As a result, many of these overseas voters organised on social media to bring theirs and other ballots back through casual couriers.[75][76] The Election Commission of Malaysia currently denies trying to stop overseas Malaysians to vote.\\r\\nControversies have erupted after six candidates for the opposition coalition, Pakatan Harapan, were disqualified from running under suspicious circumstances on Nomination Day (Saturday 28 April 2018).[77] The most prominent disqualification was that of PKR vice-president Chua Tian Chang, who the local returning officer prevented from defending his Batu parliamentary seat due to an earlier court conviction, despite a High Court judgement which made clear he was eligible to continue as an MP. A subsequent High Court appeal was thrown out, under the claim that they did not have jurisdiction over election-related matters.[78] Chua and his party are consequently endorsing independent candidate, 22-year-old P. Prabakaran, for the seat.[79]\\r\\nMeanwhile, in Rantau, Negeri Sembilan, the state's Chief Minister Mohamad Hasan was re-elected unopposed after opposition candidate Dr. Streram Sinnasamy was prevented from entering the nomination centre, ostensibly as he did not have an entry pass, despite his claim that he was never issued one and despite the fact that there are no laws requiring candidates to have entry passes.[80] Four other opposition candidates were barred for being undischarged bankrupts, despite claims that earlier checks with the authorities had confirmed their ability to participate.[77]\\r\\nLawyers and other political analysts have criticised these returning officers for a \\"gross abuse of power\\" that went beyond their primary role (to assist with filing nomination papers) and deprived several candidates of the chance to exercise their democratic right. They claim that incidents like this contribute to the perception that Malaysian elections are inherently unfair and weaken the rule of law.[81] Pakatan Harapan chairman Mahathir Mohamad has confirmed that he will appeal these decisions to the courts, alleging an \\"abuse of power\\" by \\"officers who are willing to do illegal things on orders\\".[82]\\r\\nThe ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional, has faced criticism for alleged vote-buying. The Nikkei Asian Review has noted that measures like cash bonuses being handed out to civil servants and pensioners, key components of its support base, occurred just before the dissolution of the lower house of Parliament,[83] with other measures announced during the campaign trail including \\"special aid\\" of RM500 (US$127) and reserved social housing units for employees of government-linked company DRB-HICOM[84] as well as minimum wage increases.[85]\\r\\nWithin constituencies, Barisan Nasional MPs have come under significant criticism from electoral watchdog Bersih, with seven out of ten individuals named in their \\"Election Offenses Hall of Shame\\" being from Barisan Nasional component parties. Musa Aman, Noh Omar, Hamzah Zainudin and Shahanim Mohd Yusuf (BN-UMNO) as well as P. Kamalanathan and Jaspal Singh (BN-MIC) were publicly reprimanded for handing out free food, petrol, furniture, groceries and motorcycles in their respective constituencies, in what was widely seen as an attempt to sway the vote in favour of them.[86]\\r\\nControversy has also erupted over Barisan Nasional's battle for the Sekinchan constituency, considered a marginal seat held by opposition party DAP, where an election event organised by Datuk Seri Jamal Yunos (the UMNO chief for Sungai Besar) in support of local candidate Lee Yee Yuan (BN-MCA) included an all-you-can-eat buffet, chances to win a motorcycle and a RM25,000 (US$6,345) cash prize, as well as a promise of a RM2,000 (US$508) payment for every voter if they are elected.[87] All payments, along with a claimed RM150,000 in donations and a Mercedes-Benz C200 to be offered at the next event, were claimed to have been donated by \\"successful businessmen\\" in the small fishing village (population: 20,000) who wanted to show their \\"gratitude\\" to BN.[88] While Yunos denies any wrongdoing, claiming that he is not a candidate but is \\"only conveying contributions from certain individuals,\\" the Sekinchan DAP branch has lodged a police report against him for alleged vote-buying.[89]\\r\\nYunos has also faced controversy for being caught on video handing out RM50 (US$13) notes from a bag at a function in the Sungai Leman Bendang Utara village, which is also part of Sekinchan. He has claimed that those being paid were \\"party workers\\" responsible for \\"putting up flags, buntings and other materials,\\" a claim that media were unable to independently verify. Media outlet Malaysiakini noted that most of those being paid were not dressed in Barisan Nasional colours, and that significant numbers of senior citizens and children were present at the event.[90]\\r\\nThe main opposition alliance, Pakatan Harapan, has also not been immune to allegations of vote-buying. Pakatan Harapan's manifesto, particularly, lists as a key promise the abolition of Malaysia's 6% GST and increasing minimum wages, which journalists and financial analysts claim amounts to pork-barrel populism that could negatively affect Malaysian government finances.[83][91] Bersih also included Afif Bahardin (PH-PKR) on their Election Offenses Hall of Shame for utilising Penang state government programmes to give handouts such as hampers to voters in his constituency of Seberang Jaya.[92]\\r\\nAdditionally, Ahmad Yakob (GS-PAS) the Chief Minister of Kelantan, was singled out for criticism after \\"repeatedly using Kelantan state government\\" resources to benefit the campaign of his party, PAS (competing as the main component of the Gagasan Sejahtera coalition), including by handing out cash to religious leaders in a state government hall covered in PAS flags.[86]","input":"Who is the next prime minister of malaysia?"},{"output":"the heart-shaped herb","context":"Black Panther is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Jack Kirby, first appearing in Fantastic Four #52 (cover-dated July 1966) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Black Panther's real name is T'Challa, king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies.\\r\\nBlack Panther is the first superhero of African descent in mainstream American comics, having debuted years before early African American superheroes such as Marvel Comics' the Falcon (1969), Luke Cage (1972) and Blade (1973), or DC Comics' John Stewart in the role of Green Lantern (1971). In one comic book storyline, the Black Panther mantle is handled by Kasper Cole, a multiracial New York City police officer. Beginning as an impersonator, Cole would later take on the moniker of White Tiger and become an ally to T'Challa. The role of Black Panther and leadership of Wakanda is also given to T'Challa's sister Shuri for a short time.\\r\\nBlack Panther has made numerous appearances in various television shows, animated films and video games. The character is portrayed in live action by Chadwick Boseman in the 2016 film Captain America: Civil War, and the 2018 films Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\\r\\nIn 2011, Black Panther was ranked 51st overall on IGN's \\"Top 100 Comic Books Heroes\\" list.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Black Panther's name predates the October 1966 founding of the Black Panther Party, though not the black panther logo of the party's predecessor, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO), nor the segregated World War II Black Panthers Tank Battalion.[2][3] Stan Lee, co-creator of the comic, denied that the comic was named after any of the political uses of the term \\"black panther\\", including the LCFO, citing \\"a strange coincidence\\".[4] He is the first black superhero in American mainstream comic books; very few black heroes were created before him, and none with actual superpowers. These included the characters in the single-issue, low-distribution All-Negro Comics #1 (1947); Waku, Prince of the Bantu, who starred in his own feature in the omnibus title Jungle Tales, from Marvel's 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics; and the Dell Comics Western character Lobo, the first black person to star in his own comic book. Previous non-caricatured black supporting characters in comics include U.S. Army infantry private Gabriel Jones of Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos.\\r\\nIn a guest appearance in Fantastic Four #119 (Feb. 1972), the Black Panther briefly tried using the name Black Leopard to avoid connotations with the Party, but the new name did not last.[5] The character's name was changed back to Black Panther in Avengers #105, with T'Challa explaining that renaming himself made as much sense as altering the Scarlet Witch's name, and he is not a stereotype.[6]\\r\\nCo-creator Stan Lee recounted that the name was inspired by a pulp adventure hero who has a black panther as a helper.[7] Jack Kirby's original concept art for Black Panther used the concept name Coal Tiger.[8]\\r\\nFollowing his debut in Fantastic Four #52ÿ53 (JulyÿAug. 1966) and subsequent guest appearance in Fantastic Four Annual #5 (1967) and with Captain America in Tales of Suspense #97ÿ100 (Jan.ÿ April 1968), the Black Panther journeyed from the fictional African nation of Wakanda to New York City to join the titular American superhero team in The Avengers #52 (May 1968), appearing in that comic for the next few years. During his time with the Avengers, he made solo guest-appearances in three issues of Daredevil, and fought Doctor Doom in Astonishing Tales #6ÿ7 (June & Aug. 1971), in that supervillain's short-lived starring feature.\\r\\nHe received his first starring feature with Jungle Action #5 (July 1973), a reprint of the Panther-centric story in The Avengers #62 (March 1969). A new series began running the following issue, written by Don McGregor, with art by pencilers Rich Buckler, Gil Kane, and Billy Graham, and which gave inkers Klaus Janson and Bob McLeod some of their first professional exposure. The critically acclaimed[9] series ran in Jungle Action #6ÿ24 (Sept. 1973 ÿ Nov. 1976).[10]\\r\\nOne now-common format McGregor pioneered was that of the self-contained, multi-issue story arc.[11] The first, \\"Panther's Rage\\", ran through the first 13 issues. Critic Jason Sacks has called the arc \\"Marvel's first graphic novel\\":\\r\\n[T]here were real character arcs in Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four [comics] over time. But ... \\"Panther's Rage\\" is the first comic that was created from start to finish as a complete novel. Running in two years' issues of Jungle Action (#s 6 through 18), \\"Panther's Rage\\" is a 200-page novel that journeys to the heart of the African nation of Wakanda, a nation ravaged by a revolution against its king, T'Challa, the Black Panther.[11]\\r\\nThe second and final arc, \\"Panther vs. the Klan\\", ran as mostly 17-page stories in Jungle Action #19ÿ24 (Jan.ÿNov. 1976), except for issue #23, a reprint of Daredevil #69 (Oct. 1970), in which the Black Panther guest-starred.[10] The subject matter of the Ku Klux Klan was considered controversial in the Marvel offices at the time, creating difficulties for the creative team.[12]\\r\\nAfrican-American writer-editor Dwayne McDuffie said of the Jungle Action \\"Black Panther\\" feature:\\r\\nThis overlooked and underrated classic is arguably the most tightly written multi-part superhero epic ever. If you can get your hands on it ... sit down and read the whole thing. It's damn-near flawless, every issue, every scene, a functional, necessary part of the whole. Okay, now go back and read any individual issue. You'll find seamlessly integrated words and pictures; clearly introduced characters and situations; a concise (sometimes even transparent) recap; beautifully developed character relationships; at least one cool new villain; a stunning action set piece to test our hero's skills and resolve; and a story that is always moving forward towards a definite and satisfying conclusion. That's what we should all be delivering, every single month. Don [McGregor] and company did it in only 17 story pages per issue.[9]\\r\\nThough popular with college students, the overall sales of Jungle Action were low,[13] and Marvel relaunched the Black Panther in a self-titled series, bringing in the character's co-creator Jack Kirbynewly returned to Marvel after having decamped to rival DC Comics for a timeas writer, penciler, and editor. However, Kirby wanted to work on new characters and was unhappy at being assigned a series starring a character he had already worked with extensively.[14] He left the series after only 12 issues and was replaced by Ed Hannigan (writer), Jerry Bingham (penciler), and Roger Stern (editor). Black Panther ran 15 issues (Jan. 1977 ÿ May 1979).[15] Due to the series's cancellation, the contents of what would have been Black Panther #16ÿ18 were published in Marvel Premiere #51ÿ53.\\r\\nA four-issue miniseries, Black Panther vol. 2,[16] (JulyÿOct. 1988) was written by Peter B. Gillis and penciled by Denys Cowan.[17] McGregor revisited his Panther saga with Gene Colan in \\"Panther's Quest\\", published as 25 eight-page installments within the bi-weekly anthology series Marvel Comics Presents (issues #13ÿ37, Feb.ÿDec. 1989).[18] He later teamed with artist Dwayne Turner in the square-bound miniseries Black Panther: Panther's Prey (Sept. 1990 ÿ March 1991).[19] McGregor conceived a fifth arc in his Black Panther saga, titled \\"Panther's Vows\\", but it failed to get off the ground.[13]\\r\\nWriter Christopher Priest's and penciller Mark Texeira's 1998 series The Black Panther vol. 3 used Erik Killmonger, Venomm, and other characters introduced in \\"Panther's Rage\\", together with new characters such as State Department attorney Everett Ross; the Black Panther's adopted brother, Hunter; and the Panther's protg, Queen Divine Justice. The Priest-Texeira series was under the Marvel Knights imprint in its first year. Priest said the creation of character Ross contributed heavily to his decision to write the series. \\"I realized I could use Ross to bridge the gap between the African culture that the Black Panther mythos is steeped in and the predominantly white readership that Marvel sells to,\\" adding that in his opinion, the Black Panther had been misused in the years after his creation.[20]\\r\\nThe last 13 issues (#50ÿ62) saw the main character replaced by a multiracial New York City police officer named Kasper Cole, with T'Challa relegated to a supporting character. This Black Panther, who became the White Tiger, was placed in the series The Crew, running concurrently with the final few Black Panther issues. The Crew was canceled with issue #7.\\r\\nIn 2005, Marvel began publishing Black Panther vol. 4,[21] which ran 41 issues (April 2005 ÿ Nov. 2008).[22] It was initially written by filmmaker Reginald Hudlin (through issue #38) and penciled by John Romita, Jr. (through #6). Hudlin said he wanted to add \\"street cred\\" to the title, although he noted that the book was not necessarily or primarily geared toward an African-American readership.[23] As influences for his characterization of the character, Hudlin has cited comic character Batman, film director Spike Lee, and music artist Sean Combs.[23] Other influences include historical figures such as 14th-century Mali Empire sultan Mansa Musa and 20th-century Jamaican activist Marcus Garvey, as well as Biblical figures such as Ham and Canaan.[24]\\r\\nBlack Panther vol. 5[25] launched in February 2009, with Hudlin, again scripting, introducing a successor Black Panther, T'Challa's sister Shuri.[26][27][28] Hudlin co-wrote issue #7 with Jonathan Maberry, who then became the new writer,[29] joined by artist Will Conrad.[30] The Panther was also a featured player, with members of the Fantastic Four and the X-Men, in the Doctor Doom-based, six-issue miniseries Doomwar (AprilÿSept. 2010).[31]\\r\\nT'Challa then accepted an invitation from Matt Murdock, the superhero Daredevil, to become the new protector of New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. He became the lead character in Daredevil beginning with issue #513 (Feb. 2011), when that series was retitled Black Panther: The Man Without Fear.[32] Under writer David Liss and artist Francesco Francavilla, he took on the identity of Mr. Okonkwo, an immigrant from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and becomes the owner of a small diner in order to be close to the people.[33]\\r\\nA new Black Panther series written by Ta-Nehisi Coates and drawn by Brian Stelfreeze was launched in 2016 and continues to be published with Coates as the head writer.[34][35][36]\\r\\nIn 2017, the afrofuturist writer Nnedi Okorafor wrote the series Black Panther: Long Live the King.[37]\\r\\nThe Black Panther is the ceremonial title given to the chief of the Panther Tribe of the advanced African nation of Wakanda. In addition to ruling the country, he is also chief of its various tribes (collectively referred to as the Wakandas). The Panther habit is a symbol of office (head of state) and is used even during diplomatic missions. The Panther is a hereditary title, but one must still earn it.\\r\\nIn the distant past, a meteorite made of the (fictional) vibration-absorbing mineral vibranium crashed in Wakanda, and was unearthed. Reasoning that outsiders would exploit Wakanda for this valuable resource, the ruler, King T'Chaka, like his father and other Panthers before him, concealed his country from the outside world. T'Chaka's first wife N'Yami died while in labor with T'Challa, and his second wife Ramonda was taken prisoner by Anton Pretorius during a visit to her homeland of South Africa, so for most of his childhood T'Challa was raised by his father alone.[38] T'Chaka was murdered by the adventurer Ulysses Klaw in an attempt to seize the vibranium mound. With his people still in danger, a young T'Challa used Klaw's sound weapon on Klaw and his men, shattering Klaw's right hand and forcing him to flee.[39]\\r\\nT'Challa was next in line to be the king of Wakanda and Black Panther, but until he was ready to become the leader of the nation, his uncle S'yan (T'Chaka's younger brother) successfully passed the trials to become the Black Panther. While on his Wakandan walkabout rite of passage, T'Challa met and fell in love with apparent orphaned teen Ororo Munroe, who would grow up to become the X-Men member Storm.[40] The two broke off their relationship due to his desire to avenge his father's death and to become the type of man who could suitably lead Wakanda, but they would see each other over the years when they could.\\r\\nT'Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the various champions of the Wakandan tribes. One of his first acts was to disband and exile the Hatut Zerazethe Wakandan secret policeand its leader, his adopted brother Hunter the White Wolf.[41] He sold off small portions of vibranium to scientific institutions around the world, amassing a fortune which he used to arm himself with advanced technology.[39] Later, to keep peace, he picked dora milaje (\\"adored ones\\") from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives-in-training. He then studied abroad for a time before returning to his kingship.\\r\\nIn his first published appearance, the now-adult T'Challa invites the American superhero team the Fantastic Four to Wakanda, then attacks and attempts to neutralize them individually in order to test himself to see if he is ready to battle Klaw, who had replaced his shattered right hand with a sonic weapon.[42][43] For their part, the Four manage to rally and stymie T'Challa in a team counter-attack, enabling the impressed King to stand down and explain himself to the team's satisfaction. After the ruler makes proper amends to the Four, they befriend and help T'Challa, and he in turn aids them against the supervillain the Psycho-Man.[44] T'Challa later joins the Avengers,[45] beginning a long association with that superhero team. He first battles the Man-Ape while with the group,[46] and then meets the American singer Monica Lynne,[47] with whom he becomes romantically involved. He helps the Avengers defeat the second Sons of the Serpent, and then reveals his true identity on American television.[48] He encounters Daredevil, and reveals to him that he had deduced Daredevil's true identity.[49]\\r\\nAfter receiving numerous urgent official letters requesting him to return to his increasingly troubled homeland,[50] the Panther eventually leaves his active Avengers membership to return to a Wakanda on the brink of civil war, bringing Lynne with him. After defeating would-be usurper Erik Killmonger and his minions,[51] the Panther ventures to the American South to battle the Ku Klux Klan.[52] He later gains possession of the mystical time-shifting artifacts known as King Solomon's Frogs.[53] These produce an alternate version of T'Challa from a future 10 years hence, a merry, telepathic Panther with a terminal brain aneurysm, whom T'Challa places in cryogenic stasis.\\r\\nLater, while searching for and finding his stepmother Ramonda, the Panther contends with South African authorities during Apartheid.[54] T'Challa eventually proposes and becomes engaged to Monica Lynne,[55] though the couple never marry.\\r\\nYears later, the Panther accepts a Washington, D.C. envoy, Everett K. Ross, and faces multiple threats to Wakanda's sovereignty. Ross assists him in many of these threats. In gratitude, the Panther often risks much for Ross in return. The first threat he and Ross encounter is \\"Xcon\\", an alliance of rogue intelligence agents backing a coup led by the Reverend Achebe.[56] Afterward, Killmonger resurfaces with a plot to destroy Wakanda's economy. This forces T'Challa to nationalize foreign companies.[57] Killmonger then defeats him in ritual combat, thus inheriting the role of Black Panther,[58] but falls into a coma upon eating the heart-shaped herbpoisonous to anyone outside the royal bloodline, which had a hereditary immunity to its toxic effects.[59] T'Challa preserves his rival's life rather than allowing him to die.\\r\\nLater, T'Challa finds he has a brain aneurysm like his alternate future self, and succumbs to instability and hallucinations. After his mental state almost causes tribal warfare, the Panther hands power to his council[60] and hides in New York City. There he mentors police officer Kasper Cole (who had adopted an abandoned Panther costume), an experience that gives T'Challa the strength to face his illness, reclaim his position, and return to active membership in the Avengers, whom he helps secure special United Nations status.\\r\\nT'Challa recounts the story of his ascension as the Black Panther in the fourth volume of his eponymous comic book series. He defeated his uncle during the Black Panther celebration,[61] and during his walkabout when he met and fell in love with a street urchin named Ororo in Cairo, Egypt.[62] Unbeknownst to him the US government is planning a coup in order to get access to the vibranium. They allow Klaw to recruit a team of villains in order to support his totalitarian neighbor, Niganda. Klaw recruits Rhino, Black Knight, Batroc the Leaper, and Radioactive Man to lead the invasion. The US government then deploys an army of Deathloks to \\"support\\" T'Challa and justify an invasion, but T'Challa kills Klaw and Storm wipes out the Deathlok army in a hurricane.[63]\\r\\nT'Challa then helps his old flame Ororo Munroe reunite with her surviving family members in Africa and the U.S.[64] He shortly afterward proposes,[volume?&?issue?needed] and the two are married in a large Wakandan ceremony attended by many superheroes.[65] One of the couple's first tasks is to embark on a diplomatic tour, in which they visit the Inhumans, Doctor Doom, the President of the United States, and Namor, with only the last one ending well.[66] After the death of Bill Foster, the Black Panther and Storm side with Captain America's anti-registration forces.[67] During the end battle between both sides, the Wakandan embassy in Manhattan is heavily damaged, though no Wakandans are hurt.[68] After the confrontation, the Panther and Storm briefly fill in for vacationing Fantastic Four members Reed and Sue Richards before returning to Wakanda.[69]\\r\\nUpon returning to Wakanda alone, leaving Storm in New York to aid the X-Men, Black Panther faces Erik Killmonger, defeating him with assistance from Monica Rambeau (a.k.a. Pulsar).[70] Afterward, Wakanda fends off the alien shapeshifters the Skrulls, who had infiltrated as part of their \\"Secret Invasion\\" plan to conquer Earth.[71] Prince Namor attempts to recruit T'Challa for the Cabal, a secret council of supervillains. Attacked by the forces of fellow Cabal member Doctor Doom, T'Challa is left comatose.[72] His sister Shuri is trained as the next Panther, with the mantle passing onto her officially after T'Challa awakens from his coma and attempts to recover from his injuries.[73]\\r\\nIn the aftermath, T'Challa loses all of his enhanced attributes given to him by being the panther totem. As a result, he works with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to accumulate a replacement.[74] He has since made a pact with another unknown Panther deity, returning his attributes to an even higher level as well as placing incantations on his body, making himself highly resistant to most magic and mystic assaults. This has all been done in preparation for the imminent battle with Doctor Doom,[75] which culminated in T'Challa rendering all of the processed vibranium inert to give his people a chance to rebuild without their dependence on the element.[76]\\r\\nAfter the events of \\"Shadowland\\", Matt Murdock (the superhero Daredevil) asks T'Challa to replace him as guardian of Hell's Kitchen, which gives T'Challa a chance to discover himself. With the help of Foggy Nelson, T'Challa assumes the identity of Mr. Okonkwo, an immigrant from the Congo and manager of a diner called Devil's Kitchen, so that he can blend in and learn about the denizens as an ordinary man. He gets on well with two of the Kitchen's staff: Sofija, a migrant from Serbia who was formerly involved in violent Serbian nationalism, and the busboy, Brian. He also gets to know some of the neighbors from his apartment block: Mr. Nantakarn and his son Alec, as well as Iris, a social worker assigned to handle cases of child abuse.[77]\\r\\nT'Challa finds himself up against an ambitious new crime lord, Vlad Dinu, who styles himself \\"The Impaler\\". He also seeks an understanding with the police through Detective Alex Kurtz. During an attempt by Vlad to terminate the Panther, Brian from the Devil's Kitchen is seriously injured by an energy blast from Vlad, and is reported dead. The conflict between Vlad and the Panther becomes more personal, especially after Vlad discovers the Panther over his wife Angela dead from a gunshot wound.[77]\\r\\nT'Challa learns that Iris was the serial shooter who killed abusers of childrenGabe was abused secretly by Angela. Brian was kidnapped by his doctor, Dr. Holman, at the behest of Nicolae who wanted to use someone who received a dose of Vlad's power. After being subjected to torturous experiments, Brian lost the ability to think for himself but was rescued by Gabe who also stole the serum produced from the experiment meant to endow the recipient with Vlad's powers. The Panther obtains evidence of Vlad Dinu's crimes as well as clues to Iris as the serial shooter, and turns the evidence over to Kurtz. Vlad kills his own son Nicolae before being subdued by the Panther. Gabe is arrested for attempting to take Iris' life. Before being taken away, Gabe reveals to the Panther Brian's fate. Though aware of the Panther's identity as Mr. Okonkwo, both Iris and Sofija promise to keep silent.[77]\\r\\nShortly after Daredevil returns to Hell's Kitchen, T'Challa returns to Wakanda, serving as a second to his sister, Shuri. In preparation for an upcoming attack on Wakanda as part of the Avengers vs. X-Men storyline, the Panther God returns T'Challa's abilities.[78] Empowered by the Phoenix, Namor destroys Wakanda with a massive tidal wave.[79] Returning to help, Storm is stunned when the Panther informs her that their marriage has been annulled.[80]\\r\\nAfter witnessing an alternate Earth over Wakanda being destroyed by the Black Swan, T'Challa reforms the Illuminatiwith Beast replacing the now-deceased Charles Xavierto confront the threat of the Incursions, parallel universes colliding with each other to the destruction of both. Although able to avert one Incursion with the Infinity Gauntlet, the subsequent destruction of the Infinity Gems forces the group to decide to resort to more questionable measures to protect Earth from future Incursions, wiping Captain America's mind so that he will not remember these events, allowing them to do \\"what needs to be done\\".[81] Although equipped with planet-destroying weapons to protect Earth, the Illuminati mostly become disgusted with the wholesale slaughter, until Namor breaks off from the group to form a new Cabal of villains to do what the heroes will not. Despite Namor's Cabal achieving legitimacy as Earth's protectors, Namor grew weary of the wholesale slaughter they carried out in the name of preserving their universe. Although he collaborated with the Illuminati in a plan to destroy the Cabal by trapping them on the next Earth to be destroyed, Black Panther and Black Bolt left him behind to die with the Cabal, disgusted at his earlier actions,[82] although Namor and the Cabal escape to the Ultimate universe when the other Earth has a simultaneous Incursion.[83]\\r\\nWhen the final Incursion occurs during the Secret Wars storyline, resulting in all realities collapsing into one Earth, Black Panther is one of the few heroes to survive the Incursion in a specially-designed \\"life pod\\"other survivors including Mister Fantastic, Star-Lord, Spider-Man, the new Thor, Captain Marvel and a Phoenix-enhanced Cyclopsalthough they are only released into the new world after an eight-year stasis. Retrieved by Doctor Strange, they learn that Strange has assumed a role of \\"sheriff\\" to Doctor Doom, who has appointed himself the god of the new \\"Battleworld\\" created from the multiple realities.[84] Although Doom effortlessly kills Cyclops, Strange protects the other heroes by dispersing them across Battleworld,[85] with T'Challa and Namor eventually discovering a new version of the Infinity Gauntlet that Strange collected, ensuring that the Gems he found would work in the location where Doom built his main fortress.[86] Recruiting the residents of the deadlands as an army, T'Challa marches on Doom at the same time as multiple other areas rebel against him through the encouragement of the heroes,[87] but admits when Doom confronts him that he was only intended as a distraction while Reed targets Doom's power source. As Reed takes Doom's power and sets out to rebuild the multiverse, T'Challa uses the Time Gem to take himself back to Wakanda before the Incursions, proclaiming to his people that they will lead the way to the stars and explore new ideas.[88]\\r\\nAs part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel, Black Panther is a member of the Ultimates.[89]\\r\\nDuring the Civil War II storyline, Black Panther represents Wakanda on the Alpha Flight Space Program's Board of Governors.[90] He sides with Captain Marvel on needing help from an Inhuman who can predict the possible future named Ulysses Kain.[volume?&?issue?needed] Black Panther and Shuri take part in the fight against the Leviathon Tide.[91]\\r\\nDuring Hydra's reign over the world led by Arnim Zola, Baron Zemo and Steve Rogers, Panther is captured for opposing this regime, and brought into a containing room. Once Panther and Zemo are alone, Winter Soldier rescues Panther. Panther entrusts the unconscious Zemo to Winter Soldier, while trailing Rogers and Zola into the secret lab. Panther finds out that Zola infused a brainwashed Captain America with a Cosmic Cube using a stolen Stark tech modified by Zola himself, and warns his allies to retreat from a Cosmic Cube-powered Steve Rogers, but is too late.[92] Even though one of the heroes knows they cannot defeat a Cosmic Cube-powered Supreme Hydra Rogers, Winter Soldier, Captain America (Sam Wilson) and Ant-Man (Scott Lang) trick Rogers by surrendering the last fragment of the cube to him. Winter Soldier and Ant-Man steal the cube from Rogers before he uses its full potential, and bring back Kobik and the real Steve Rogers.[93][94] After the defeat of Supreme Hydra Steve Rogers, Black Panther establishes his quest to go across the universe with his people, and found an Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda on Planet Bast, located in the Benhazin Star System.[95]\\r\\nThe title \\"Black Panther\\" is a rank of office, chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan. As chieftain, the Panther is entitled to eat a special heart-shaped herb which, in addition to his mystical, shamanistic connection with the Wakandan Panther God Bast, grants him superhumanly acute senses, enhanced strength, speed, agility, stamina, durability, healing, and reflexes.[96][97]\\r\\nHe has since lost this connection and forged a new one with another unknown Panther deity, granting him augmented physical attributes as well as a resistance to magic.[75] His senses are so powerful that he can pick up a prey's scent and memorize tens of thousands of individual ones. Following his war with Doom, T'Challa loses his enhanced abilities only to once again establish a connection with the Panther God.[78] In addition to the resurgence of his now superhuman abilities, he is anointed \\"King of the Dead\\", granting him the power and knowledge of all the past Black Panthers as well as the ability to control the Undead.[98] After Battleworld and the resurgence of the Multiverse T'challa eventually showcased new powers in regards to his King of the Dead status, for not only could he reanimate the dead but summon departed spirits into the physical world with tangible form as well. Using these spiritual energies also enables him to conjure a mythical mystical spear of glowing blue energy to his hand.[99]\\r\\nT'Challa worked with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to endow T'Challa with immunity to mystical attacks and detection in order to defeat Dr. Doom. When T'Challa's alchemical upgrade was tested by means of Wakanda's most powerful acolytes attacking T'Challa in unison, each mystical attack was absorbed and only served to strengthen T'Challa. During these preparations, T'Challa invented a potent mystical-scientific hybrid art called \\"shadow physics\\" and was able to use it to craft shadow weapons and to track vibranium on a quantum level.[75]\\r\\nAs king of Wakanda, the Panther has access to a vast collection of magical artifacts, advanced Wakandan technological and military hardware, and the support of his nation's wide array of scientists, warriors, and mystics. The Wakandan military has been described as one of the most powerful on Earth. His attire is the sacred vibranium costume of the Wakandan Panther Cult.\\r\\nHe is a skilled hunter, tracker, strategist, politician, inventor, and scientist. He has a PhD in physics from Oxford University. He is proficient in physics and advanced technology, and is also an inventor. T'Challa has been granted the strength and knowledge of every past Black Panther.[78]\\r\\nT'Challa is rigorously trained in acrobatics and hand-to-hand combat. He is skilled in various forms of unarmed combat, with a unique hybrid fighting style that incorporates acrobatics and aspects of animal mimicry.[100]\\r\\nThe chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan is one of the wealthiest people in the world, although financial estimates are difficult given Wakanda's isolation from the world's economy and the uncertain value of Wakanda's vast vibranium reserves and extremely advanced technologies.[101]\\r\\nIn Black Panther volume 3, writer Christopher Priest expanded the Panther's day-to-day arsenal to include equipment such as an \\"energy dagger\\", a vibranium-weave suit, and a portable supercomputer, the \\"Kimoyo card\\".[102] In Black Panther volume 4, writer Reginald Hudlin introduced such specialized equipment as \\"thrice-blessed armor\\" and \\"light armor\\" for specific tasks,[103] and for a short while outfitted him with the Ebony Blade of the Black Knight.[104]\\r\\nThe mantle of the Black Panther is passed down from generation to generation among the rulers of Wakanda[105] although it must still be deserved through a severe selection involving the best warriors of the nation.\\r\\nBashenga appeared for the first time in Black Panther Vol. 1 #7 (January 1978) by Jack Kirby (scripts and drawings). Wise warrior at the head of the Panther Tribe, according to legends, during the tumult where the vibranium meteorite fell on the soil of the village, then composed of various warring clans, he gathered all the aforementioned under his guide to defeating the inhabitants transformed by the impact into fierce \\"demonic spirits\\", a company which has unified the nation by founding Wakanda and becoming its first ruler[106] and the first to obtain the title of \\"Black Panther\\" as it tells of his \\"spiritual connection\\" with the Goddess Pantera Bast that led to the foundation of the Cult of the Panther.[105]\\r\\nChanda appeared for the first time in Fantastic Four Unlimited Vol. 1 #1 (March 1993) by Roy Thomas (scripts) and Herb Trimpe (drawings). Black Panther and ruler of Wakanda during the Second World War, Chanda is the husband of Nanali and father of T'Chaka and S'Yan; distinguished by an excessively good and compassionate nature, he welcomed the Nazi colonel Fritz Klaue after he crashed into his reign due to a plane crash. Over time, the two make a kind of friendship and Klaue develops a strong obsession with the culture of Wakanda coming to try to convince them to make their religion deist rather than spiritist, which causes a strong friction between him and Chanda culminating in the death of Nanali by the Nazi and in its subsequent expulsion from the country.[107]\\r\\nIn several subsequent stories, T'Chaka's father (and husband of Nanali) is called Azzuri the Wise and is presented in a completely different way from Chanda,[108][109] leaving the doubt if it is only a sort of nickname or another character.\\r\\nT'Chaka appeared for the first time in Fantastic Four Vol. 1 #53 (August 1966) by Stan Lee (script) and Jack Kirby (art). The eldest son of King Azzuri and Queen Nanali, T'Chaka inherits the throne and the title of the Black Panther on his father's death by being helped in his monarch duties by his younger brother and trusted adviser S'Yan.[110] After having married a woman named N'Yami, believing she can not have children, she adopts a child with her, Hunter, however, she later becomes pregnant and dies giving birth to her first child, T'Challa; from the relationship with a woman of another tribe T'Chaka then has a second son, Jakarra, and finally remarries with Ramonda, a woman who grows her children as her own and from whom she has her only daughter, Shuri,[110] but which subsequently disappears into nothingness, leading him to believe that he has abandoned it.[38] To protect the kingdom, T'Chaka instituted a policy of strong isolationism,[111] but in the course of his life he often collaborated with agents of the US government.[109][112] He is killed by Ulysses Klaw after having surprised him to illegally extract vibranium in his kingdom.[113]\\r\\nIn Black Panther Vol. 3 #15 (February 2000), Erik Killmonger challenges and bests T'Challa in a duel for the throne, overthrowing him as king of Wakanda and taking on the role as the Black Panther.[114] He becomes comatose after attempting to ingest the Heart-shaped Herb to acquire the Black Panther's powers, as he is not of royal blood. Killmonger's time as king is short-lived however, as he is killed by Monica Rambeau during T'Challa's attack to reclaim Wakanda.[115]\\r\\nS'Yan The Fast, appeared for the first time in Black Panther Vol. 4 #2 (May, 2005) by Reginald Hudlin (scripts) and John Romita Jr. (drawings). The second son of King Azzuri and Queen Nanali, S'Yan is T'Chaka's younger and trusted advisor, after whose death, although he has no desire to reign, he agrees to ascend the throne until his nephew became an adult.[110] Ironically, S'Yan, who has never wanted to be king, becomes one of the most beloved monarchs in the history of Wakanda but, nevertheless, when T'Challa returns home and obtains the title of Black Panther, he leaves with joy, returning to play the role of royal adviser.[110] He died during the war with Latveria to defend Ramonda from the soldiers of Doctor Doom.\\r\\nWhen T'Challa ends up in a coma because of Doctor Doom,[116] Shuri becomes his substitute as Black Panther and queen of Wakanda which, after the rise of her half-brother to \\"king of the dead\\", creates for the first time in history two avatars of the Panther Goddess.\\r\\nBlack Panther was ranked the 79th greatest comic book character by Wizard magazine.[120] IGN ranked the character the 51st greatest comic book hero, stating that Black Panther could be considered Marvel's equivalent to Batman;[121] he was also ranked tenth in their list of \\"The Top 50 Avengers\\".[122] In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked the Black Panther as #33 on their list of the \\"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\\".[123]\\r\\nJournalist Joe Gross praised Christopher Priest for his characterization of the Black Panther, stating, that the writer \\"turned an underused icon into the locus of a complicated high adventure by taking the Black Panther to his logical conclusion. T'Challa (the title character) is the enigmatic ruler of a technologically advanced, slightly xenophobic African nation, so he acts like it\\". Gross applauded the title's \\"endless wit, sharp characterization, narrative sophistication and explosive splash panels\\".[124]\\r\\nComics reviewer and journalist Mike Sangiacomo, however, criticized the narrative structure. \\"Christopher Priest's fractured writing is getting on my nerves. Like the Spider-Man comics, I want to like Black Panther, but Priest's deliberately jumbled approach to writing is simply silly. I know it's a style, but does he have to do it every issue?\\"[125]\\r\\nReporter Bill Radford cited similar concerns when the title had just launched. \\"I appreciate the notion of seeing the Black Panther through the eyes of an Everyman, but the Panther is almost relegated to secondary status in his own book. And Ross' narration jumps around in time so much that I feel like his boss, who, in trying to get Ross to tell her what has happened, complains: 'This is like watching \\"Pulp Fiction\\" in rewind. My head is exploding.'\\"[126]\\r\\nPublishers Weekly gave a negative review to the first arc, \\"Who Is the Black Panther?\\", a modern retelling of the character's origin, saying, \\"Hudlin's take is caught between a rock and a hard place. His over-the-top narrative is not likely to appeal to fans of the most recent version of the character, but it's too mired in obscure Marvel continuity to attract the more general reader. The plot manages to be convoluted without ever becoming absorbing\\".[127]\\r\\nJournalist Shawn Jeffords, citing the lack of appearances of the title character in the first issue, called the new series a \\"fairly unimpressive launch\\". Jeffords also said general-audience unfamiliarity was a hindrance. \\"He's never been a marquee character and to make him one will be tough\\".[128]\\r\\nT'Challa is Coal Tiger, Sersi kills the Avengers and Coal Tiger is the only survivor.[129]\\r\\nIn the Age of Ultron story, Black Panther contacts the Fantastic Four and informs them that Ultron has invaded Earth with an army of Ultron Sentinels.[130] Black Panther was later seen with Red Hulk and Taskmaster in Chicago spying on some Ultron Sentinels. When Taskmaster takes out a Sentinel that was sneaking up on him, alerting the other Sentinels, Red Hulk holds off the Sentinels while Black Panther and Taskmaster flee. During the mayhem, Black Panther falls several stories and breaks his neck, killing him instantly.[131]\\r\\nBronze Tiger is the ruler of Wakanda and is named B'Nchalla; an amalgamation of the Bronze Tiger (DC) and the Black Panther (Marvel).\\r\\nIn Avengers Forever, Captain America and Goliath visit an alternate future timeline where Martian invaders have ravaged the Earth. An aged Black Panther leads this reality's version of the Avengers, who consist of Jocasta, Living Lightning, Killraven, Crimson Dynamo and Thundra.[132]\\r\\nIn an alternate reality where the Civil War between Iron Man and Captain America never ended, Black Panther was killed alongside Maria Hill after activating Prison 42's self-destruct mechanism.[133] He is succeeded by his son, Azari, who takes on the Black Panther name.[134] It is later revealed that the Black Panther who destroyed Prison 42 was actually Queen Veranke of the shape-shifting alien Skrull race, who had stolen T'Challa's identity in order to manipulate and prolong the Civil War to suit her own needs.[135]\\r\\nT'Challa is Chieftain Justice, a Captain Britain Corps member, in Excalibur #44 (1991).[136]\\r\\nIn the alternate universe of Earth X, T'Challa has been affected by the mutative event that drives the plot. Like most of humanity, he is mutated; in this case to become a humanoid black panther. He is entrusted with the Cosmic Cube by Captain America, who knows that T'Challa would be the only one to resist using it and to never give it back if asked. In fact, Captain America does ask for it back and T'Challa is forced to refuse.[137]\\r\\nAn alternate version of Black Panther, called simply \\"Panther\\", is drafted onto the interdimensional superhero team the Exiles.[138] The Panther is the son of T'Challa and Storm and named T'Chaka, after his grandfather. Originating from Earth-1119, he was ambushed by Klaw while examining some ruins. Caught in Klaw's blast, the Panther was plucked out of time and placed on the team.[138] Unlike the stoic 616-Black Panther, The Panther is a wisecracking flirt.[138] After his assumed death on Earth-1119, his sister took up the mantle of Black Panther.[139]\\r\\nThe Black Panther appears in issues #1 and #6ÿ7 of Marvel Comics/Fox Kids comic book series based on the TV show The Avengers: United They Stand.\\r\\nT'Challa appears in Marvel Mangaverse Volume 2 as a man with a pet panther. When summoning the spirits, T'Challa and his panther combine to become the Black Panther. He also became The Falcon. This Black Panther was romantically attracted to Tigra. T'Challa's sister, T'Chana, reveals herself to be this universe's Doctor Doom.[140]\\r\\nIn the Marvel 2099 continuity, a greatly weakened Wakanda is soon to be governed by its princess, Okusana. Fearing that she is not ready, she requests Doom's help in resurrecting Thandaza, her grandfather and a former Black Panther. Doom (who claims to have agreed to the proposal out of respect for T'Challa) and the Wakandan scientists revive Thandaza in a cyberbetic body made from vibranium, but the plan goes awry when Mkhalali, the current Panther Guard, opens fire on Thandaza, believing his resurrection to be an abomination. The attack throws off the calibrations and leaves Thandaza in a maddened state and constant pain, causing him to go on a bloody rampage. Doom is ultimately forced to kill Thandaza, who thanks him for ending his suffering.[141]\\r\\nBlack Panther was featured in the Marvel Knights 2099 one shots, which were not tied to the main 2099 continuity. A new Black Panther, K'Shamba, rose to fight and thwart the mounting invasions by the successor of Doom. While the victory over the new Doom appeared triumphant, the new Wakandan king was ultimately revealed to be a puppet of Doom.[142]\\r\\nBlack Panther is, for the most part, one of the few uninfected superheroes in the alternate-universe series Marvel Zombies, where he is kept as a food supply for the Zombie Giant-Man, who keeps the Panther imprisoned and cuts off various limbs so that he can maintain his intelligence via a ready access to fresh meat without infecting Panther with the zombie \\"virus\\".[143] Despite having lost half of his right arm and his left foot, the Panther escapeswith the severed head of zombified superheroine the Wasp in tow[144]and joins forces with the mutant group the Acolytes.[145] While with the Acolytes, T'Challa briefly talks with his Earth-616 counterpart, where he expresses surprise at his marriage to Storm but offers him all the information he can provide about the zombie plague.[146] Decades later, T'Challa has married one of the Acolytes, Lisa Hendricks, and they have a son, with Forge having provided T'Challa with artificial limbs to compensate for his injuries.[147] Facing retirement, the Panther is stabbed and critically wounded by an agent of an Acolyte splinter group, and the Wasp now a willing ally after having lost her zombie hunger zombifies the Panther in order to grant him continued existence. With the Wasp's help, he survives to the post-hunger stage himself and continues to lead his people, despite his status.[148] Further internal betrayal lead the Black Panther and many of his allies to be tossed through the dimensions.[149] He ends up involved with another Earth that is threatened by the zombie virus. His attempts to save this new planet fail and he is destroyed, leaving only one hand displayed as a trophy by his enemies.[150]\\r\\nIn the MC2 universe, Black Panther has a son named T'Chaka II, who joined the A-Next as the Coal Tiger.[151]\\r\\nIn the Mutant X reality, Black Panther had the appearance of a humanoid black panther. He is among the second wave of heroes who died fighting the Beyonder.[152]\\r\\nIn the alternate-reality Ultimate Marvel imprint, the Black Panther is T'Challa Udaku, a young man who is experimented on in the Weapon X program before being liberated by Nick Fury.[153]\\r\\nT'Challa, the younger son of King T'Chaka of Wakanda, is severely injured during the \\"Trial of the Panther\\" from which the protector of the nation is selected. His older brother M'Baku finds T'Challa bloodied, mute, and near death but derisively calls him a fool for attempting the trial. Later, M'Baku adds that he, not T'Challa, should have taken the trial. Angry that his father has decided to share Wakanda's technology in exchange for America's help in saving T'Challa's life, M'Baku leaves the kingdom.\\r\\nTo save T'Challa, T'Chaka turns him over to the Weapon X program. Over a year later, a healthy T'Challa, in his full Black Panther garb, has enhanced speed, strength, night vision, and healing ability. Additionally, he can summon short, cat-like Adamantium claws from his knuckles by balling his hands into fists. T'Chaka becomes outraged upon learning that S.H.I.E.L.D. (who had shut down Weapon X and freed T'Challa) now considers his son an asset of the U.S. and S.H.I.E.L.D. He subsequently sends M'Baku a letter, claiming that M'Baku, not T'Challa, is the titular \\"favorite son\\", and he implores M'Baku to return.\\r\\nFury has Captain America train and mentor the Panther, who reveals his damaged throat. Captain America, sympathizing for the Panther's plight, encourages Fury to place the Panther in the superhero team the Ultimates. This turns out to be a ruse in which Captain America impersonates the Panther, allowing T'Challa to escape and return home to Wakanda.[154]\\r\\nCaptain America later impersonates Black Panther during an Ultimates confrontation with the Juggernaut.[155]\\r\\nAfter Ultimatum, Black Panther joins the New Ultimates.[156]\\r\\nChadwick Boseman portrays T'Challa within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, first appearing in Captain America: Civil War (2016).[170][171] In the film, he is shown displaying enhanced speed, agility, strength, and durability, which he gains from ingesting the heart-shaped herb, as in the comics.[172] His suit has retractable claws and is made of a vibranium weave, which can deflect heavy machine gun fire. As of the 2018 film Black Panther, he wears a new variant of the suit that can absorb kinetic energy (represented as purple highlights) and release it as a purple shockwave after enough has been amassed. It can also fold into a silver necklace.\\r\\nIn 2016, Disney XD launched on its YouTube channel the motion comic \\"Black Panther in ...

The patient is assigned a unique identifier that is used to refer to this patient across the enterprise. The objective is to ensure that each patient is represented only once across all the software systems used within the organization.[1][2] The essential patient data includes name, gender, date of birth, race and ethnicity, social security number, current address and contact information, insurance information, current diagnoses, most recent date of hospital admission and discharge (if applicable), etc.\\r\\nEMPIs are intended to solve the common problem where multiple systems across the organization gradually become inconsistent with respect to the patient's most current data when the patient's information changes, and only one system is updated, i.e., the changes are not propagated to the others. A similar problem may be seen for non-healthcare organizations with respect to customer data.\\r\\nMany software vendors use EMPI and MPI (master patient index) synonymously, because an MPI is only workable if it is used by all software applications across an entire enterprise: that is, \\"master\\" implies enterprise-wide scope.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn computing, an enterprise[-wide] master patient index is a form of customer data integration (CDI) specific to the healthcare industry. Healthcare organizations or groups of them will implement EMPI to identify, match, merge, de-duplicate, and cleanse patient records to create a master index that may be used to obtain a complete and single view of a patient. The EMPI will create a unique identifier for each patient and maintain a mapping to the identifiers used in each records' respective system.\\r\\nAn EMPI will typically provide an Application Programming Interface (API) for searching and querying the index to find patients and the pointers to their identifiers and records in the respective systems. It may also store some subset of the attributes for the patient so that it may be queried as an authoritative source of the \\"single most accurate record\\" or \\"source of truth\\" for the patient. Registration or other practice management applications may interact with the index when admitting new patients to have the single best record from the start, or may have the records indexed at a later time.\\r\\nAn EMPI may additionally work with or include enterprise application integration (EAI) capabilities to update the originating source systems of the patient records with the cleansed and authoritative data.\\r\\nA key component of an EMPI is the match engine.[4] A match engine may be deterministic, probabilistic, or naturalistic. [5] [6] The match engine must be configured and tuned for each implementation to minimize the false matches and unmatches. The accuracy and performance of the match engine are a big factor in determining the value and ROI for an EMPI solution.\\r\\nThe attributes a match engine is configured to use will typically include name, date of birth, sex, social security number, address and more. The match engine must be able to give consideration to typos, misspellings, transpositions, aliases, and more.[7]\\r\\nEven the best tuned EMPI will not be 100% accurate. Thus an EMPI will provide a data stewardship interface for reviewing the match engine results, handling records for which the engine does not definitively determine a match or not. This interface will provide for performing search, merge, unmerge, edit and numerous other operations. This interface may also be used to monitor the performance of the match engine and perform periodic audits on the quality of the data.\\r\\nOrganizations that would use an EMPI include hospitals, medical centers, outpatient clinics, physician offices, rehabilitation facilities, etc.\\r\\nBy correctly matching patient records from disparate systems and different organizations, a complete view of a patient may be obtained. With this complete view, numerous benefits may be realized including:\\r\\nNumerous companies provide EMPI products. Some are pure-play providers and others provide EMPI offerings as part of a broader MDM or integration solution. In addition there are healthcare industry specific MPI providers such as 4medica Big Data eMPI, Stibo Systems Healthcare, Mohawk College, Care Data Systems, ARGO, QuadraMed, NextGate, Atlas,MultiVue, HealthUnity (ZeOmega), InterComponentWare Inc.

Founded in 1900 as the Mack Brothers Company, it manufactured its first truck in 1907 and adopted its present name in 1922.[1] Mack Trucks is a subsidiary of AB Volvo which purchased Mack along with Renault Trucks in 2000.[2] After being founded in Brooklyn, New York, the company's headquarters were in Allentown, Pennsylvania, from 1905 to 2009, when they moved to Greensboro, North Carolina.[3] The entire line of Mack products is still produced in Lower Macungie, Pennsylvania,[4] with additional assembly plants in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Australia, and Venezuela.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, the company's manufacturing facilities are located at LVO Lehigh Valley Operations formally known as the Macungie Assembly Operations Plant in Lower Macungie Township, Pennsylvania. Mack Trucks is one of the top producers in the vocational and on-road vehicle market, class 8 through class 13. It is also one of the most popular manufacturers of heavy-duty off-road trucks in the United States.[citation needed]\\r\\nMack trucks have been sold in 45 countries. The Macungie, Pennsylvania, manufacturing plant, located near its former Allentown corporate headquarters, produces all Mack products. The Mack MP-series engine, Mack transmissions, the TC-15 transfer cases, and rear engine power take-offs are designed and manufactured in Hagerstown, Maryland, which, according to local historians, was the original factory location.[citation needed]\\r\\nParts for Mack's right-hand-drive vehicles are produced in Brisbane, Australia, for worldwide distribution.

A 377?cu?in (6.2?L) 4 cylinder gasoline engine 4X2 with chain drive, it was strong, reliable, and worked well in rough terrain. Introduced in 1916, there was a great demand because of World War I, over 6000 ?3?1?2-, ?5?1?2-, and ?7?1?2-ton trucks were built for the UK and US military. There were also commercial sales from 1916; the AC was well suited for logging and construction work. A larger version, the AP, built between 1926 and 1938, was an off-road haul truck used on Boulder Dam and other large projects. 40,299 ACs had been built when production ended in 1939. [6][25] [26] [27]\\r\\nThe N Series was Mack's first military design, large 6 and 7 1/2 ton 6X6 artillery prime movers. Between its development in the late 1930s and the beginning of production in 1940 US military requirements changed and the truck was not needed. All NMs and most of the larger NOs were exported as foreign aid. After World War II the NO was developed into the successful M 123 semi-tractor. [28]\\r\\nThe Mack B series models were Mack's primary vehicle from its introduction in 1953 until it was replaced by the R Series in 1966. They ranged in size from the medium duty B20P gas powered 4X2 to the oversized B873SX turbo-diesel 6X6. B Models were commonly used as semi tractors and in the construction industry. They were also used as fire engines and trucks, sometimes with the roof of the cab removed. 127,786 B Models were built. [6] [29]\\r\\nMack started to produce the Mack R series (R, RW, and U models) in 1966 for highway use, and the RD, DM, and all wheel drive RM and DMM models for construction use. The lightweight RL model followed in 1967, the RW Superliner with a large, rectangular hood and grill in 1977, and the setback front axle RB in the 1990s. All these models featured the same cab; the U, DM, and DMM had the cab offset to the left.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, the R, RW, and U series models were discontinued and the RB was introduced, mostly for severe-duty applications. The hood was modified slightly for the model RB. 2004 was the last year for the RD, and 2006 for the RB and DM. The DM was the last model to use this cab style, and was the last model of this family to be produced.[30][31]\\r\\nAs a replacement for the construction models, Mack started to offer the Granite, Granite Bridge-Formula and Granite Axle-back.[6]\\r\\nAlso this model is serving in the Mexican Army as a Troop and Utility Truck in configuration 6X6 OR 6X4\\r\\nBy 1916 Mack was producing 4- and 6-cylinder gasoline engines, and through 2014 continued to offer their own, in the form of three diesel V8s. Engines by other manufacturers were often optional, supplied over the years by Caterpillar, Cummins, Chrysler, Detroit Diesel, Hercules, Scania, and Waukesha.\\r\\nMack started making diesels in 1938, in 1957 the END and turbocharged ENDT 673 diesel were introduced. This 672?cu?in (11.0?L) I6 engine family was successful, and remained in production for over 30 years.\\r\\nIn the early 1960s, Mack Truck's executive vice president of product and engineering, Walter May, developed the Maxidyne high-torque rise engine. The engine was introduced as an inline six in 1966, as a V8 in 1970, and as the intercooled inline six 300 series in 1973. This was an industry-changing event. The Maxidyne, with an operating range of 1200ÿ2100 R.P.M, and later 1050ÿ1700 R.P.M., allowed a heavy Class 8 truck to be operated with a 5 speed (Maxitorque) transmission. Previously, heavy trucks typically operated between 1800-2100R.P.M. and were equipped with 10 or more gears.\\r\\nIn 2014 Mack offers three engine series, the 11 L MP 7, 13 L MP8, and 16 L MP10, with 325?hp (242?kW) to 605?hp (451?kW) and 1,200?lb{ft (1,627?N{m) to 2,060?lb{ft (2,793?N{m). [32] [33] [6] [34]\\r\\nMack also produced railroad cars and locomotives between 1905 and 1930.[35]\\r\\nThe company's trademark is the bulldog, which can be found on the front of almost all Mack trucks. A gold-plated bulldog indicates the truck was made with a Mack produced drive train of engine, transmission and drive axles. A chrome bulldog indicates other manufacturers' components were used.[citation needed]\\r\\nMack trucks earned their nickname during World War I, when the British government purchased the Mack AC for supplying its front lines. Its pugnacious, blunt-nosed hood, tenacious performance, and durability, reminded the soldiers of their country's mascot, the British Bulldog.[36][37]\\r\\nThe logo was first used in 1921 for the AB chain drive models and became the official corporate logo in 1922.[38]\\r\\nThis is a list of the highest ranking executive officer of Mack Trucks since its inception:\\r\\nMack built over 35,000 heavy duty military trucks during World War II, most for export under Lend-Lease. None were US Army standard types, all were designed and built exclusively by Mack.\\r\\nThe EH series was a commercial design 5 ton (4,536?kg)[39] 4x2 adapted for military service. The EH, EHU (cabover) and semi-tractor models EHT and EHUT were used by the US Army in Europe. Over 2,400 were built in 1942.

They are thought to live up to fifty years[1] and to reach a length up to 2.3?m (7.5?ft). Several commercial fisheries exist for Patagonian toothfish which are detailed below.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis species is also sold under the trade names Chilean Seabass in the United States and Canada; Merluza negra in Argentina, Peru and Uruguay; Legine australe in France; Mero in Korea, Japan, and Spain, and Bacalao de profundidad in Chile.[2]\\r\\nThe name \\"Chilean Seabass\\" was invented by a fish wholesaler named Lee Lantz in 1977. He was looking for a name that would make it attractive to the American market. He considered \\"Pacific sea bass\\" and \\"South American sea bass\\" before settling on \\"Chilean sea bass\\".[3] In 1994, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted \\"Chilean Seabass\\" as an \\"alternative market name\\" for Patagonian toothfish,[3] and in 2013 for Antarctic toothfish.\\r\\nIn the UK, the approved commercial designations for D. eleginoides and D. mawsoni are \\"icefish\\" and \\"toothfish\\".[4] This has created some confusion as there is a genuine \\"icefish\\" (Champsocephalus gunnari) caught in subantarctic waters, which does not resemble toothfish in any way.\\r\\nPatagonian toothfish spawn in deep water (around 1,000m) during the austral winter, producing pelagic eggs and larvae. Larvae switch to a demersal habitat at around 100m (1 year old) and inhabit relatively shallow water (<300m) until 6ÿ7 years of age, when they begin a gradual migration into deeper water. As juveniles in shallow water, toothfish are primarily piscivorous, consuming the most abundant suitably sized local prey. With increasing size and habitat depth, the diet diversifies and includes more scavenging of squid, fish, and crustaceans.[1] In turn, toothfish constitute a small part of the diets of sperm whales, southern elephant seals, and colossal squid.[5][6][7]\\r\\nAs most toothfish fisheries are managed in accordance with CCAMLR regulations and conservation measures, it should be noted that CCAMLR adopts an ecosystem approach which requires that all other living resources of the Southern Ocean are treated as an integrated system where effects on predator, prey and related species are considered, and decisions on sustainable harvesting levels are made on the basis of sound, internationally peer reviewed scientific advice.[8]\\r\\nCommercial fishing of toothfish is managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) inside the CCAMLR Convention Area which spans the Antarctic continent and waters between 45S and 60S. Some fisheries inside territorial waters within the Convention Area (e.g. Crozet Island, Prince Edwards and Marion Islands) are managed separately by countries with territorial waters taking CCAMLR management practices into account. Toothfish fisheries outside the CCAMLR Convention Area in the coastal waters of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay are managed by the relevant coastal state. However, these fisheries are still subject to the CCAMLR Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) which tracks the trade of toothfish from the point of unloading to the point of final consumption.[9]\\r\\nIn the legal toothfish fisheries managed by CCAMLR and countries with territorial waters, the most common method is fishing by longlines (where a long \\"mainline\\" is set in the water, with many baited hooks coming off that line). A small quantity of toothfish is caught by trawling (where a net is towed behind the boat for short periods of time). For all methods of legal fishing for toothfish, there are minimal interactions with, and risks to, seabirds.[10] This is a result of requirements for legal operators to use mitigation devices or approaches such as:\\r\\nIn 2011 the CCAMLR Scientific Committee Chair, David Agnew, was quoted as saying levels of seabird mortality are negligible in most areas, with the one region yet to achieve these \\"near zero\\" results, having reduced seabird interactions by over 98% from their peak levels, and have continued to improve each year.[13]\\r\\nTrawling generally catches toothfish in the smaller size range, which requires calculations to be made at the annual stock assessment meetings of CCAMLR to take these catches of smaller sized fish into account, and lowers the overall available catch of toothfish by trawl. CCAMLR has prohibited all trawl fishing in high seas waters and exploratory fisheries.[14]\\r\\nTo minimise the risk of long-term adverse effects on target species, by-catch species and marine ecosystems, CCAMLR uses a number of compliance systems to monitor fishing activities in the Convention Area. This includes:\\r\\nThe Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) for Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) and Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) was one measure that ensured reductions in illegal fishing for toothfish and reduced the scope for trade in illegally caught fish. The CDS is an innovative online catch document information system (DCD: Dissostichus Catch Document) developed to identify legal toothfish harvested, which tracks toothfish from the point of landing throughout the trade cycle to point of sale. The CDS requires verification and authorisation by national authorities at regular intervals in the trade cycle. Identification of the origin of toothfish entering the ports and markets of CDS Parties is essential.[19][20]\\r\\nThe Coalition of Legal Toothfish Operators, Inc. (COLTO) is a toothfish fishing industry body whose members represent around 85% of the legal toothfish catch worldwide. Seven of the fisheries that are fished by COLTO members are now independently certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)[21] as sustainable and well managed fisheries. Commercial fishing of Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish is managed by CCAMLR around most of the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic regions, however a fishery that lies within a nations Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is managed by that nation, taking into account management recommendations and approaches by CCAMLR.[22]\\r\\nIn 2004, the South Georgia toothfish fishery (CCAMLR Statistical Division 48.3) was the first toothfish fishery to be MSC certified, and was recertified in 2009 and 2014, as all MSC certified fisheries must be audited annually, and fully reassessed every five years. Currently, the South Georgia Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is 2,400t, and there are 6 longline vessels being operated by 4 companies in this fishery, which is managed by the UK overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.[23][24]\\r\\nThe Ross Sea fishery (CCAMLR Statistical Division 88.1 and 88.2) was the second toothfish fishery to be independently evaluated and certified by the MSC as sustainable and well managed (in 2010, and re-certified in 2015). This fishery catches mainly Antarctic toothfish, a close relative to the Patagonian toothfish.[25][26]\\r\\nThe Heard Island and McDonald Islands fishery (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58.5.2) was certified as a sustainable and well managed fishery by the MSC in March 2012 (and re-certified in 2017) and is operated under Australian jurisdiction in a manner consistent with CCAMLR regulations. There are 4 vessels operated by 2 Australian companies (Austral Fisheries and Australian Longline). The CCAMLR determined TAC is 3,405t of toothfish for the 2016/17 season.[27][28]\\r\\nThe Macquarie Island toothfish fishery is within the Australian EEZ, and is situated outside the CCAMLR Convention Area within FAO Statistical Area 81, though it is managed in a complementary way with the conservation measures adopted by CCAMLR. In May 2012, this was the fourth toothfish fishery to gain MSC certification (and re-certified in 2017). There are 2 Australian companies that are allocated to catch 450t of toothfish in 2017/18.[29][30]\\r\\nFrance regulates Patagonian toothfish in the waters surrounding the French islands in the South Indian Ocean, with scientific oversight from the National Museum of Natural History. These fisheries are located around the Kerguelen Islands (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58.5.1) and the Crozet Islands (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58.6). Fishing authorizations have been granted to six fishing companies based out of Reunion Island. The TAC for the Kerguelen Island fishery is 5,050t and was certified by the MSC in September 2013.[31] The current TAC for the Crozet Islands fishery is 1,300t, and was certified by the MSC in 2017.\\r\\nThe Falkland Islands, a self-governing British Overseas Territory, also has a toothfish fishery and was awarded MSC certification in 2014. The Falklands do not fall in the CCAMLR Convention area, though regulations on fishing methods, science and management mirror CCAMLR requirements. The TAC is currently 1,040t and is caught by a sole longline vessel.[32][33]\\r\\nCombined, over 50% of all legally harvested toothfish is independently assessed and certified by the MSC as being from sustainable and well managed fisheries.[34][35]\\r\\nThe Chilean toothfish fishery is separated into two separate fleets. The \\"artisanal fleet\\" of small boats operates in the region north of 47S inside the Chilean EEZ; and 8 vessels from the \\"industrial fleet\\" operate south of 47S inside the Chilean EEZ as well as on the high seas both within and outside CCAMLR waters.[36] The TAC for the industrial fleet is determined each year by the Chilean government based on biological studies carried out by both public and private scientific bodies. The current Chilean TAC for the industrial fleet is 1,656t that is caught by 3 companies. Since 2006, artisanal fleet catches have fluctuated between 2,091t and 1,558t per annum,[37][38]. It's current quota is 1,491t.\\r\\nArgentina has a toothfish fishery off its coastline that is managed by the Argentine Federal Fisheries Council under recommendations from the National Fisheries Research Institute. This season the Argentine TAC is 3,700t that is caught by 5 vessels from 4 companies.[39]\\r\\nThe Prince Edward and Marion Islands toothfish fishery is managed and regulated by Branch Fisheries, part of the South African Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. The South African Marine Resource Authorities fully supports and follows all CCAMLR Conservation Measures. The current TAC is 575t and is fished by two vessels belonging to two fishing companies/cooperatives, with catches having been restricted significantly following excessive illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in those waters in the late 1990s.[40][41] TACs from this fishery have slowly started to increase as the stock begins to recover.\\r\\nThe total allowable catch of toothfish worldwide is around 28,300t in 2017, with around 85% of this coming from COLTO members, and 56% of the total catch (15,900 tonnes) now being independently certified as coming from sustainable and well managed fisheries by the Marine Stewardship Council.[35]\\r\\nIn the late 1990s to early 2000s, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) for toothfish nearly collapsed some fisheries in the Southern Ocean. Though, since 2005, thanks to CCAMLR Member nations, government patrol vessels, NGOs, media exposure and a trade and port state measures, IUU fishing has been all but eliminated from within countries' exclusive economic zones, and until 2015 a relatively small portion of IUU fishing still occurred in high seas areas[42]. In 2014 and 2015 there were several major campaigns to eliminate IUU fishing for toothfish. This included the Sea Shepherd campaign, \\"\\"Operation Icefish\\", which pursued one of the vessels, the Thunder, for 110 days before it was scuttled.[43] Operations by the Royal New Zealand Navy, the Royal Australian Navy, Interpol, and governments of Spain, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia all combined to successfully apprehend, arrest and prosecute all of the remaining 6 IUU vessels fishing illegally for toothfish on the high seas.\\r\\nAt the peak of IUU fishing, illegal catches were estimated to be 32,000 tonnes in 1997 with approximately 55 vessels believed to be active. By 2010, IUU catches had fallen to an estimated 1,615 tonnes, all taken in high seas areas, with just four IUU fishing vessels reported to be active. This was a decrease in IUU fishing by over 95% since the mid 1990s. CCAMLR estimated in 2012 that 90% of IUU catches at the time were of Antarctic toothfish, not Patagonian toothfish.[44]\\r\\nCCAMLR annually reviews information on IUU fishing activities in the Convention Area and has established a Contracting Party and a Non-Contracting Party IUU Vessel List[45] (CCAMLR Conservation Measure 10-06 and Conservation Measure 10-07). Vessels included on the IUU Vessel Lists have engaged in IUU activities in the Convention Area and undermined the effectiveness of conservation measures, thereby threatening toothfish stocks, marine habitats and by-catch species. Vessels are included on the IUU Vessel Lists after a consensus decision from the Commission based on set criteria. This measure, combined with additional surveillance by member nations, catch documentation schemes has played a significant part in the reduction of IUU fishing for toothfish.\\r\\nIn the past, France sold some fishing rights to Japanese and other foreign fisheries, but because of IUU fishing, rights are now reserved for French fishers based at Runion Island. Because of previous poaching, the French Navy and Australian Customs vessels still work in concert, patrolling both French and Australian EEZs, having made numerous arrests and seizures in the late 1990s to early 2000s. An Australian Customs vessel, the Southern Supporter, was involved in the renowned chase and apprehension of an IUU vessel in the 2003 Viarsa incident that stretched over 7,200 kilometers.[46]\\r\\nTACs for legal operators in CCAMLR are set, taking into account the estimated IUU catches from past years, and any current IUU activity that may be occurring in the different fisheries.[47] In some fisheries this has meant a considerable reduction in legal catches ÿ an example of this is the Australian Heard Island and McDonald Islands fishery, where the legal TAC was 3,800t in 1996/97. This was dropped to a minimum of 2,427t by 2006/07 with a substantial portion of that decline attributed to the IUU catches taken from the fishery between 1996 and 2002. Since then there has been zero IUU fishing in that fishery, and the legal TAC has steadily increased.[48]\\r\\nIn addition to the Catch Documentation System mentioned above, USA regulations do not allow toothfish imports without valid Dissostichus Catch Documents; and dealer permit and pre-approval certificates issued in advance by NOAA. In addition, toothfish must be caught from vessels equipped with satellite-linked automated VMS that track vessel movements from port-to-port to ensure compliance with set quotas and boundaries. All vessel VMS data must be reported to the centralized CCAMLR system, with confirmation to USA required that it has occurred, in order for any products from those boats to be imported into the United States.[49]\\r\\nAs revealed by the \\"Black spider memos\\",[50] Charles, Prince of Wales was worried about the future for the species. An open reply noted that sea birds had indeed been protected in toothfish fisheries globally, and that IUU fishing was virtually eliminated.[51]\\r\\nThe EU has also imposed requirements against IUU fishing that include:\\r\\nPatagonian Toothfish is currently listed by the Monterey Bay Aquarium on its Seafood Watch list and pocket guides. In April 2013, Seafood Watch produced an updated report,[53] indicating new ratings for some fisheries, which allocates approximately 78% of toothfish caught worldwide, which are as follows:\\r\\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International added the Patagonian toothfish to its seafood red list. \\"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\\"[54] Greenpeace have not updated their rating of toothfish since the 2013 Monterey Bay Aquarium review.","input":"What is the real name for chilean sea bass?"},{"output":"Hamida Djandoubi","context":"Hamida Djandoubi (Arabic: ????? ???????; September 22, 1949 ÿ September 10, 1977) was a Tunisian agricultural worker and convicted murderer. He moved to Marseille, France, in 1968 and six years later he kidnapped, tortured and murdered 22-year-old lisabeth Bousquet, his former girlfriend. He was sentenced to death in February 1977 and executed by guillotine in September that year. He was the last person to be executed in Western Europe and in the European Union[2] and the last person legally executed by beheading in the Western world. Marcel Chevalier served as chief executioner.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in Tunisia on September 22, 1949, Djandoubi started living in Marseille in 1968, working in a grocery store. He later worked as a landscaper but had a workplace accident in 1971 that resulted in the loss of two-thirds of his right leg.[4]\\r\\nIn 1973, a 21-year-old woman named Elisabeth Bousquet, whom Djandoubi had met in the hospital while recovering from his amputation, filed a complaint against him, stating that he had tried to force her into prostitution.[4]\\r\\nAfter his arrest and eventual release from custody during the spring of 1973, Djandoubi drew two other young girls into his confidence and then forced them to \\"work\\" for him. On July 3, 1974, he kidnapped Bousquet and took her into his home where, in full view of the terrified girls, he beat the woman before stubbing a lit cigarette all over her breasts and genital area. Bousquet survived the ordeal so he took her by car to the outskirts of Marseille and strangled her there.\\r\\nOn his return, Djandoubi warned the two girls to say nothing of what they had seen. Bousquet's body was discovered in a shed by a boy on July 7, 1974. One month later, he kidnapped another girl who managed to escape and report him to police.\\r\\nAfter a lengthy pre-trial process, Djandoubi eventually appeared in court in Aix-en-Provence on charges of torture-murder, rape, and premeditated violence on February 24, 1977. His main defense revolved around the supposed effects of the amputation of his leg six years earlier which his lawyer claimed had driven him to a paroxysm of alcohol abuse and violence, turning him into a different man.\\r\\nOn February 25 he was sentenced to death. An appeal against his sentence was rejected on June 9.

It was released in August 2017 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux, with versions for Android, iOS, and Nintendo Switch in 2018. In the game, players must survive being stranded on an island filled with roaming dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals, natural hazards, and potentially hostile human players.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective and its open world is navigated on foot or by riding a prehistoric animal. Players can use firearms and improvised weapons to defend against hostile humans and creatures, with the ability to build bases as defense. The game has both single-player and multiplayer options. Multiplayer allows the option to form tribes of members in a server. The max number of tribe mates varies from each server. In this mode all tamed dinosaurs and building are shared between the members. \\r\\n\\r\\nDevelopment began in October 2014, where it was first released as an early access title in mid-2015. The development team conducted research into the physical appearance of the animals, but took creative license for gameplay purposes. A companion app, titled Dododex, was released for mobile devices in August 2017. One of the game modes, Survival of the Fittest, was also released as a standalone game the same month. Egypt-based developer Instinct Games was hired to facilitate the game's development. Several expansions to the game have also been released as downloadable content: The Center, Primitive Plus, Scorched Earth, Ragnarok, and Aberration. Two spin-off games developed by Snail Games were released in March 2018: ARK Park, a virtual reality game, and PixARK, a sandbox survival game.\\r\\n\\r\\nARK: Survival Evolved is an action-adventure survival game set in an open world environment with a dynamic day-night cycle and played either from a third-person or first-person perspective. To survive, players must establish a base, with a fire and weapons; additional activities, such as taming and feeding dinosaurs, require more resources.[1] The game's world, known as the \\"Ark\\", is approximately 48?km2 (19?sq?mi) in size:[2] there is approximately 36?km2 (14?sq?mi) of land with 12?km2 (4.6?sq?mi) of ocean.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are currently 132 species of creatures that populate the world of ARK. The majority of creatures can be tamed by the player, though some, such as Meganeura or Titanomyrma, cannot. Creatures in the game can be tamed, and the method varies creature by creature. Most are \\"violent\\" tames, meaning the players must knock the creature out using blunt weapons, such as a club, or through the use of tranquilizing projectiles like tranq darts. Once knocked out, the player can feed them food, such as berries for herbivores or raw meat for carnivores, with different foods taming at different speeds. Some creatures can also be tamed passively, by approaching them and carefully giving them food. Once a creature is tamed, it will follow the commands of the player who tamed them. As well, most creatures can be ridden, and therefore allow the player to utilize the creature's abilities, such as flight or fast underwater movement. [1] When riding atop certain creatures, players can still use weapons. They can also be used to carry items, and players can issue offensive and defensive commands to them; for example, a pack of Utahraptors can be assigned to defend the base, or a group of Triceratops can be ordered to attack an enemy's base.[1] Some of the larger creatures, such as a Brontosaurus or Mosasaurus, can have a building platform placed on their back, giving players a mobile, though small, base.[4] The game also features various other animals, such as the dodo, saber-toothed cat, woolly mammoth, Meganeura, Titanomyrma, and Doedicurus.[3] Every creature in the game has living ecosystems and predator hierarchies.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayers must keep track of various meters, such as health, stamina, oxygen, hunger, thirst, and \\"weight\\", or how much they can carry. Should players take damage, their health meter will gradually regenerate if they have consumed the necessary food, or if they craft items that regenerate the health meter at a faster pace. Otherwise, a player's health meter will gradually regenerate over time.[6] Players can gain experience though harvesting materials, crafting, or killing. Once the player has obtained enough experience, they will gain a level point, which can be spent improving one of the players stats, which include max health, max stamina, max oxygen, max food meter, max water meter, max carry weight, melee damage, movement speed, and crafting speed. As of August 2018, the maximum player level is 103, plus an additional 30 levels to be gained by defeating end-game bosses. Tamed creatures can also gain experience and level points, which can be spent on similar stats. Creatures spawn into the game at levels ranging from 1 to 150, and, when tamed, can gain up to 75 more levels by gaining experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayers can build structures throughout the world. To build a base, players must acquire structure componentssuch as floors, doors and windows built with the resources littered throughout the worldwhich are earned as they progress and gain levels, then collect the nessesary materials to make them. These components can then be crafted and placed in the world. Players can create any structure, as long as they have the logistics and resources; the structural integrity of the building is compromised when the pillars and foundations are destroyed.[1] Structures can be built from various tiers of materials, with better tiers providing more protection, but costing more resources to create. Players start out by creating thatch structures, then moving on to wood, stone, metal, and finally tek, a futuristic and late-game material. Players can also craft items in the game, such as weapons, by collecting the resources and technology required for crafting.[7] In addition, players can craft and attach accessories to their weapons, such as a scope or flashlight for a pistol or machine gun.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreliminary work on ARK: Survival Evolved began in October 2014.[9] Studio Wildcard, the Seattle-based team behind the game, co-opted Egypt-based developer Instinct Games to facilitate development.[10] When researching for information about the game's prehistoric species, the development team read \\"general audience books\\" and online articles, and sought assistance from friends who studied in the fields in biological sciences.[3] When creating the species and world, the team took creative license for gameplay purposes, although there is an in-game reason that the species have diverged from their historical counterparts.[3] Many of the development team members were inspired by dinosaur films such as Jurassic Park and The Land Before Time.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team added features to the game that would appeal to all players, as opposed to specifically players of the survival genre, such as the ability to simply explore the island and compete against large bosses, as a reward for uncovering secrets of the island.[12] They also added an end-game for players to strive towards, as they felt that most survival games lack a final goal. They wanted to \\"provide a depth and scope that allows for the world to not just be a means to an end [...] but also a place to explore\\", said creative director Jesse Rapczak.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game, powered by Unreal Engine 4, contains \\"tens of thousands\\" of artificial intelligence entities, according to Rapczak.[5] It also features support for virtual reality (VR) gameplay; Rapczak, who has almost three years of experience with head-mounted displays, described the game as being designed with VR in mind from the beginning.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game was initially released through Steam Early Access for Microsoft Windows on June 2, 2015,[13] shortly before the theatrical release of Jurassic World later that month. Rapczak said that the game's release was scheduled to take advantage of the \\"dino fever\\" that was present with the film's imminent release.[14] The game subsequently received an Early Access release for Linux and OS X on July 1, 2015,[10] and through the Xbox Game Preview Program for Xbox One on December 16, 2015;[15] a PlayStation 4 version was released on December 6, 2016.[16] The final game launched in August 2017;[16] it was originally intended for release in June 2016,[10] but was delayed in April.[17] The game launched with support for Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR,[13] and the Xbox One version was released via the ID@Xbox program.[10] Android and iOS versions were released on June 14, 2018,[18] and a Nintendo Switch version is due on November 30, 2018.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 16, 2016, the Survival of the Fittest game mode was released in early access as a free standalone game with no microtransactions; it was scheduled to fully launch in mid 2016,[17] but was eventually merged back to the main game as the development team did not wish to monetize on its release, and wanted to ensure that modders can apply the development kit of Survival Evolved to create mods for Survival of the Fittest.[20] There will be various eSports tournaments of the game mode, with a prize pool of US $50,000.[21] Players who played Survival of the Fittest before it was merged back into the main game can continue to play the game without paying an extra cost, while new players must pay before getting access to it. It will be available for every player who purchases the main game.[20][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 1, 2016, Studio Wildcard released the paid downloadable content (DLC) Scorched Earth. The expansion includes a new, desert map as well as several desert-themed resources and items. It also features ten new creatures, some of which are fictional, like the Wyvern. The release of paid DLC for a game still in early access caused negative reaction among players of the game, resulting in lots of negative reviews on Steam right after the expansion launch.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 12, 2017, the paid DLC Aberration was released, adding a new underground/alien-themed map and 15 new alien/underground themed creatures, as well as new items such as climbing hooks and glider suits to navigate the hostile terrain.[24] The largest map in terms of playable area, Aberration also allowed players to  continue the story line of ARK and discover more of the truth about the ARK worlds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game left early access on August 29, 2017, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The standard version was released alongside an \\"Explorer's Edition\\", which included a season pass with three expansions, and the \\"Collector's Edition\\", which included a season pass as well, a necklace, a map, a notebook, a development team poster, a wooden chest packaging, and the game's official soundtrack.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nA new paid DLC, named Extinction, was announced on June 19, 2018. It will include a brand new world, a corrupted, dystopian Earth, as well as several new creatures and items. Studio Wildcard has given November 6th, 2018 as a release date.\\r\\n\\r\\nARK: Survival Evolved received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[26][27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nGameSpot gave the game a 6/10, saying: \\"This outstanding sense of place and mood is offset by the sheer difficulty of everything that you have to do, the spectacular amounts of time necessary to experience even a tenth of what the game has to offer, and the randomness of death constantly destroying everything that you have built.\\"[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nTJ Hafer's 7.7/10 review on IGN stated that \\"When I'm having a good time in Ark, I'm having a really good time. The problem is that those moments are usually one part to every nine parts menial grinding and crafting - especially at the later tech tiers. Having to repeat so much work after failing an attempt at a boss feels far too punishing, and some really dumb dinosaurs can take a lot of the challenge and sense of danger out of the many primal locations. Even with all of those quirks, however, I'm still hungry to play more after the 60 hours I've spent so far. There aren't a lot of survival games that have legitimately held my attention that long.\\"[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIan Birnbaum of PC Gamer gave the game a score of 72/100, stating it to be \\"a bloated, grindy mess, but so packed with options that a better game is hidden inside it.\\"[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin a month of its early access release on Steam, ARK had sold over one million copies.[33] By August 2016, the game had over 5.5 million sales across both Windows and Xbox One, with about 1.5 million from the Xbox One platform.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes","input":"What was the first dlc expansion for ark?"},{"output":"Herbert Spencer","context":"\\"Survival of the fittest\\" is a phrase that originated from Darwinian evolutionary theory as a way of describing the mechanism of natural selection. The biological concept of fitness is defined as reproductive success. In Darwinian terms the phrase is best understood as \\"Survival of the form that will leave the most copies of itself in successive generations.\\"\\r\\nHerbert Spencer first used the phrase, after reading Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, in his Principles of Biology (1864), in which he drew parallels between his own economic theories and Darwin's biological ones: \\"This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called 'natural selection', or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.\\"[1]\\r\\nDarwin responded positively to Alfred Russel Wallace's suggestion of using Spencer's new phrase \\"survival of the fittest\\" as an alternative to \\"natural selection\\", and adopted the phrase in The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication published in 1868.[1][2] In On the Origin of Species, he introduced the phrase in the fifth edition published in 1869,[3][4] intending it to mean \\"better designed for an immediate, local environment\\".[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert Spencer first used the phrase ÿ after reading Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species?ÿ in his Principles of Biology of 1864[7] in which he drew parallels between his economic theories and Darwin's biological, evolutionary ones, writing, \\"This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called 'natural selection', or the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life.\\"[1]\\r\\nIn July 1866 Alfred Russel Wallace wrote to Darwin about readers thinking that the phrase \\"natural selection\\" personified nature as \\"selecting\\", and said this misconception could be avoided \\"by adopting Spencer's term\\" Survival of the fittest. Darwin promptly replied that Wallace's letter was \\"as clear as daylight. I fully agree with all that you say on the advantages of H. Spencer's excellent expression of 'the survival of the fittest'. This however had not occurred to me till reading your letter. It is, however, a great objection to this term that it cannot be used as a substantive governing a verb\\". Had he received the letter two months earlier, he would have worked the phrase into the fourth edition of the Origin which was then being printed, and he would use it in his \\"next book on Domestic Animals etc.\\".[1]\\r\\nDarwin wrote on page 6 of The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication published in 1868, \\"This preservation, during the battle for life, of varieties which possess any advantage in structure, constitution, or instinct, I have called Natural Selection; and Mr. Herbert Spencer has well expressed the same idea by the Survival of the Fittest. The term \\"natural selection\\" is in some respects a bad one, as it seems to imply conscious choice; but this will be disregarded after a little familiarity\\". He defended his analogy as similar to language used in chemistry, and to astronomers depicting the \\"attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets\\", or the way in which \\"agriculturists speak of man making domestic races by his power of selection\\". He had \\"often personified the word Nature; for I have found it difficult to avoid this ambiguity; but I mean by nature only the aggregate action and product of many natural laws,and by laws only the ascertained sequence of events.\\"[2]\\r\\nIn the first four editions of On the Origin of Species, Darwin had used the phrase \\"natural selection\\".[8] In Chapter 4 of the 5th edition of The Origin published in 1869,[3] Darwin implies again the synonym: \\"Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest\\".[4] By the word \\"fittest\\" Darwin meant \\"better adapted for immediate, local environment\\", not the common modern meaning of \\"in the best physical shape\\" (think of a puzzle piece, not an athlete).[5] In the introduction he gave full credit to Spencer, writing \\"I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.\\"[9]\\r\\nIn The Man Versus The State, Spencer used the phrase in a postscript to justify a plausible explanation of how his theories would not be adopted by \\"societies of militant type\\". He uses the term in the context of societies at war, and the form of his reference suggests that he is applying a general principle.[10]\\r\\n\\"Thus by survival of the fittest, the militant type of society becomes characterized by profound confidence in the governing power, joined with a loyalty causing submission to it in all matters whatever\\".[11]\\r\\nThough Spencers conception of organic evolution is commonly interpreted as a form of Lamarckism,[a] Herbert Spencer is sometimes credited with inaugurating Social Darwinism. The phrase \\"survival of the fittest\\" has become widely used in popular literature as a catchphrase for any topic related or analogous to evolution and natural selection. It has thus been applied to principles of unrestrained competition, and it has been used extensively by both proponents and opponents of Social Darwinism.[citation needed]\\r\\nEvolutionary biologists criticise the manner in which the term is used by non-scientists and the connotations that have grown around the term in popular culture. The phrase also does not help in conveying the complex nature of natural selection, so modern biologists prefer and almost exclusively use the term natural selection. The biological concept of fitness refers to reproductive success, as opposed to survival, and is not explicit in the specific ways in which organisms can be more \\"fit\\" (increase reproductive success) as having phenotypic characteristics that enhance survival and reproduction (which was the meaning that Spencer had in mind).[citation needed]\\r\\nWhile the phrase \\"survival of the fittest is often used to refer to natural selection, it is avoided by modern biologists, because the phrase can be misleading. For example, survival is only one aspect of selection, and not always the most important. Another problem is that the word fit is frequently confused with a state of physical fitness. In the evolutionary meaning fitness is the rate of reproductive output among a class of genetic variants.[13]\\r\\nThe phrase can also be interpreted to express a theory or hypothesis: that \\"fit\\" as opposed to \\"unfit\\" individuals or species, in some sense of \\"fit\\", will survive some test.\\r\\nInterpretations of the phrase as expressing a theory are in danger of being tautological, meaning roughly \\"those with a propensity to survive have a propensity to survive\\"; to have content the theory must use a concept of fitness that is independent of that of survival.[5][14]\\r\\nInterpreted as a theory of species survival, the theory that the fittest species survive is undermined by evidence that while direct competition is observed between individuals, populations and species, there is little evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large groups such as, for example, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Instead, these groups have evolved by expanding into empty ecological niches.[15] In the punctuated equilibrium model of environmental and biological change, the factor determining survival is often not superiority over another in competition but ability to survive dramatic changes in environmental conditions, such as after a meteor impact energetic enough to greatly change the environment globally. The main land dwelling animals to survive the K-Pg impact 66 million years ago had the ability to live in underground tunnels, for example.\\r\\nIn 2010 Sahney et al. argued that there is little evidence that intrinsic, biological factors such as competition have been the driving force in the evolution of large groups. Instead, they cited extrinsic, abiotic factors such as expansion as the driving factor on a large evolutionary scale. The rise of dominant groups such as amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds occurred by opportunistic expansion into empty ecological niches and the extinction of groups happened due to large shifts in the abiotic environment.[15]\\r\\nIt has been claimed that \\"the survival of the fittest\\" theory in biology was interpreted by late 19th century capitalists as \\"an ethical precept that sanctioned cut-throat economic competition\\" and led to the advent of the theory of \\"social Darwinism\\" which was used to justify laissez-faire economics, war and racism. However, these ideas predate and commonly contradict Darwin's ideas, and indeed their proponents rarely invoked Darwin in support.[citation needed] The term \\"social Darwinism\\" referring to capitalist ideologies was introduced as a term of abuse by Richard Hofstadter's Social Darwinism in American Thought published in 1944.[16][17]\\r\\nCritics of theories of evolution have argued that \\"survival of the fittest\\" provides a justification for behaviour that undermines moral standards by letting the strong set standards of justice to the detriment of the weak.[18] However, any use of evolutionary descriptions to set moral standards would be a naturalistic fallacy (or more specifically the isÿought problem), as prescriptive moral statements cannot be derived from purely descriptive premises. Describing how things are does not imply that things ought to be that way. It is also suggested that \\"survival of the fittest\\" implies treating the weak badly, even though in some cases of good social behaviour?ÿ co-operating with others and treating them well?ÿ might improve evolutionary fitness.[16][19]\\r\\nRussian anarchist Peter Kropotkin viewed the concept of \\"survival of the fittest\\" as supporting co-operation rather than competition. In his book Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution he set out his analysis leading to the conclusion that the fittest was not necessarily the best at competing individually, but often the community made up of those best at working together. He concluded that\\r\\nIn the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense  not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress.\\r\\nApplying this concept to human society, Kropotkin presented mutual aid as one of the dominant factors of evolution, the other being self-assertion, and concluded that\\r\\nIn the practice of mutual aid, which we can retrace to the earliest beginnings of evolution, we thus find the positive and undoubted origin of our ethical conceptions; and we can affirm that in the ethical progress of man, mutual support not mutual struggle ÿ has had the leading part. In its wide extension, even at the present time, we also see the best guarantee of a still loftier evolution of our race.\\r\\n\\"Survival of the fittest\\" is sometimes claimed to be a tautology.[20] The reasoning is that if one takes the term \\"fit\\" to mean \\"endowed with phenotypic characteristics which improve chances of survival and reproduction\\" (which is roughly how Spencer understood it), then \\"survival of the fittest\\" can simply be rewritten as \\"survival of those who are better equipped for surviving\\". Furthermore, the expression does become a tautology if one uses the most widely accepted definition of \\"fitness\\" in modern biology, namely reproductive success itself (rather than any set of characters conducive to this reproductive success). This reasoning is sometimes used to claim that Darwin's entire theory of evolution by natural selection is fundamentally tautological, and therefore devoid of any explanatory power.[20]\\r\\nHowever, the expression \\"survival of the fittest\\" (taken on its own and out of context) gives a very incomplete account of the mechanism of natural selection. The reason is that it does not mention a key requirement for natural selection, namely the requirement of heritability. It is true that the phrase \\"survival of the fittest\\", in and by itself, is a tautology if fitness is defined by survival and reproduction. Natural selection is the portion of variation in reproductive success that is caused by heritable characters (see the article on natural selection).[20]\\r\\nIf certain heritable characters increase or decrease the chances of survival and reproduction of their bearers, then it follows mechanically (by definition of \\"heritable\\") that those characters that improve survival and reproduction will increase in frequency over generations. This is precisely what is called \\"evolution by natural selection.\\" On the other hand, if the characters which lead to differential reproductive success are not heritable, then no meaningful evolution will occur, \\"survival of the fittest\\" or not: if improvement in reproductive success is caused by traits that are not heritable, then there is no reason why these traits should increase in frequency over generations. In other words, natural selection does not simply state that \\"survivors survive\\" or \\"reproducers reproduce\\"; rather, it states that \\"survivors survive, reproduce and therefore propagate any heritable characters which have affected their survival and reproductive success\\". This statement is not tautological: it hinges on the testable hypothesis that such fitness-impacting heritable variations actually exist (a hypothesis that has been amply confirmed.)[20]\\r\\nMomme von Sydow suggested further definitions of 'survival of the fittest' that may yield a testable meaning in biology and also in other areas where Darwinian processes have been influential. However, much care would be needed to disentangle tautological from testable aspects. Moreover, an \\"implicit shifting between a testable and an untestable interpretation can be an illicit tactic to immunize natural selection [...] while conveying the impression that one is concerned with testable hypotheses.\\"[14][21]\\r\\nSkeptic Society founder and Skeptic magazine publisher Michael Shermer addresses the tautology problem in his 1997 book, Why People Believe Weird Things, in which he points out that although tautologies are sometimes the beginning of science, they are never the end, and that scientific principles like natural selection are testable and falsifiable by virtue of their predictive power. Shermer points out, as an example, that population genetics accurately demonstrate when natural selection will and will not effect change on a population. Shermer hypothesizes that if hominid fossils were found in the same geological strata as trilobites, it would be evidence against natural selection.[22]","input":"Who coined the phrase survival of the fittest?"},{"output":"a special Universal Declaration of Human Rights Drafting Committee, chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt","context":"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a historic document that was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at its third session on?10 December 1948 as Resolution 217 at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, France. Of the then 58 members of the United Nations, 48 voted in favor, none against, eight abstained, and two did not vote.\\r\\nThe Declaration consists of 30 articles affirming an individual's rights which, although not legally binding in themselves, have been elaborated in subsequent international treaties, economic transfers, regional human rights instruments, national constitutions, and other laws. The Declaration was the first step in the process of formulating the International Bill of Human Rights, which was completed in 1966, and came into force in 1976, after a sufficient number of countries had ratified them.\\r\\nSome legal scholars have argued that because countries have constantly invoked the Declaration for more than 50 years, it has become binding as a part of customary international law.[1][2] However, in the United States, the Supreme Court in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain (2004), concluded that the Declaration \\"does not of its own force impose obligations as a matter of international law.\\"[3] Courts of other countries have also concluded that the Declaration is not in and of itself part of domestic law.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe underlying structure of the Universal Declaration was introduced in its second draft, which was prepared by Ren Cassin. Cassin worked from a first draft, which was prepared by John Peters Humphrey. The structure was influenced by the Code Napolon, including a preamble and introductory general principles.[4] Cassin compared the Declaration to the portico of a Greek temple, with a foundation, steps, four columns, and a pediment.\\r\\nThe Declaration consists of a preamble and thirty articles:\\r\\nThese articles are concerned with the duty of the individual to society and the prohibition of use of rights in contravention of the purposes of the United Nations Organisation.[6]\\r\\nDuring World War II, the Allies adopted the Four Freedomsfreedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from fear, and freedom from wantas their basic war aims.[7][8] The United Nations Charter \\"reaffirmed faith in fundamental human rights, and dignity and worth of the human person\\" and committed all member states to promote \\"universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\\".[9]\\r\\nWhen the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany became fully apparent after World War II, the consensus within the world community was that the United Nations Charter did not sufficiently define the rights to which it referred.[10][11] A universal declaration that specified the rights of individuals was necessary to give effect to the Charter's provisions on human rights.[12]\\r\\nIn June 1946, the UN Economic and Social Council established the Commission on Human Rights, comprising 18 members from various nationalities and political backgrounds. The Commission, a standing body of the United Nations, was constituted to undertake the work of preparing what was initially conceived as an International Bill of Rights.[13]\\r\\nThe Commission established a special Universal Declaration of Human Rights Drafting Committee, chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt, to write the articles of the Declaration. The Committee met in two sessions over the course of two years.\\r\\nCanadian John Peters Humphrey, Director of the Division of Human Rights within the United Nations Secretariat, was called upon by the United Nations Secretary-General to work on the project and became the Declaration's principal drafter.[14] At the time, Humphrey was newly appointed as Director of the Division of Human Rights within the United Nations Secretariat.[15]\\r\\nOther well-known members of the drafting committee included Ren Cassin of France, Charles Malik of Lebanon, and P. C. Chang of the Republic of China (Taiwan).[16] Humphrey provided the initial draft which became the working text of the Commission.\\r\\nAccording to Allan Carlson, the Declaration's pro-family phrases were the result of the Christian Democratic movement's influence on Cassin and Malik.[17]\\r\\nOnce the Committee finished its work in May 1948, the draft was further discussed by the Commission on Human Rights, the Economic and Social Council, the Third Committee of the General Assembly before being put to vote in December 1948. During these discussions many amendments and propositions were made by UN Member States.[18]\\r\\nBritish representatives were extremely frustrated that the proposal had moral but no legal obligation.[19] (It was not until 1976 that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights came into force, giving a legal status to most of the Declaration.)\\r\\nThe Universal Declaration was adopted by the General Assembly as Resolution 217 on 10?December 1948. Of the then 58 members[20] of the United Nations, 48 voted in favor, none against, eight abstained[21][22] and Honduras and Yemen failed to vote or abstain.[23]\\r\\nThe meeting record[24] provides firsthand insight into the debate. South Africa's position can be seen as an attempt to protect its system of apartheid, which clearly violated several articles in the Declaration.[21] The Saudi Arabian delegation's abstention was prompted primarily by two of the Declaration's articles: Article 18, which states that everyone has the right \\"to change his religion or belief\\"; and Article 16, on equal marriage rights.[21] The six communist countries abstentions centred around the view that the Declaration did not go far enough in condemning fascism and Nazism.[25] Eleanor Roosevelt attributed the abstention of Soviet bloc countries to Article 13, which provided the right of citizens to leave their countries.[26]\\r\\nThe 48 countries which voted in favour of the Declaration are:[27]\\r\\n8 countries abstained:[27]\\r\\nOther countries only gained sovereignty and joined the United Nations later,[29] which explains the relatively small number of states entitled to the historical vote, and in no way reflects opposition to the universal principles.\\r\\nThe Declaration of Human Rights Day is commemorated every year on?December 10, the anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration, and is known as Human Rights Day or International Human Rights Day. The commemoration is observed by individuals, community and religious groups, human rights organizations, parliaments, governments, and the United Nations. Decadal commemorations are often accompanied by campaigns to promote awareness of the Declaration and human rights. 2008 marked the 60th anniversary of the Declaration, and was accompanied by year-long activities around the theme \\"Dignity and justice for all of us\\".[30]\\r\\nIn 1948, the UN Resolution A/RES/217(III)[A] adopted the Declaration on a bilingual document in English and French, and official translations in Chinese, Russian and Spanish.[31] In 2009, the Guinness Book of Records described the Declaration as the world's \\"Most Translated Document\\" (370 different languages and dialects).[32][33] The Unicode Consortium stores 431[34] of the 503[35] official translations available at the OHCHR (as of June?2017[update]).\\r\\nIn its preamble, governments commit themselves and their people to progressive measures which secure the universal and effective recognition and observance of the human rights set out in the Declaration. Eleanor Roosevelt supported the adoption of the Declaration as a declaration rather than as a treaty because she believed that it would have the same kind of influence on global society as the United States Declaration of Independence had within the United States.[citation needed] In this, she proved to be correct. Even though it is not legally binding, the Declaration has been adopted in or has influenced most national constitutions since 1948. It has also served as the foundation for a growing number of national laws, international laws, and treaties, as well as for a growing number of regional, sub national, and national institutions protecting and promoting human rights.\\r\\nFor the first time in international law, the term the rule of law was used in the preamble of the Declaration. The third paragraph of the preamble of the Declaration reads as follows: \\"Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.\\"[36]\\r\\nWhile not a treaty itself, the Declaration was explicitly adopted for the purpose of defining the meaning of the words \\"fundamental freedoms\\" and \\"human rights\\" appearing in the United Nations Charter, which is binding on all member states. For this reason, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a fundamental constitutive document of the United Nations. In addition, many international lawyers[37][38][39][40] believe that the Declaration forms part of customary international law[41] and is a powerful tool in applying diplomatic and moral pressure to governments that violate any of its articles. The 1968 United Nations International Conference on Human Rights advised that the Declaration \\"constitutes an obligation for the members of the international community\\" to all persons. The Declaration has served as the foundation for two binding UN human rights covenants: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The principles of the Declaration are elaborated in international treaties such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the United Nations Convention Against Torture, and many more. The Declaration continues to be widely cited by governments, academics, advocates, and constitutional courts, and by individuals who appeal to its principles for the protection of their recognised human rights.\\r\\nThe Universal Declaration has received praise from a number of notable people. The Lebanese philosopher and diplomat Charles Malik called it \\"an international document of the first order of importance\\",[42] while Eleanor Rooseveltfirst chairwoman of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) that drafted the Declarationstated that it \\"may well become the international Magna Carta of all men everywhere.\\"[43] In a speech on 5 October 1995, Pope John Paul II called the Declaration \\"one of the highest expressions of the human conscience of our time\\" but the Vatican never adopted the Declaration.[44] In a statement on 10 December 2003 on behalf of the European Union, Marcello Spatafora said that the Declaration \\"placed human rights at the centre of the framework of principles and obligations shaping relations within the international community.\\"[45]\\r\\nTurkey which was a secular state with an overwhelmingly Muslim populationsigned the Declaration in 1948.[46] However, the same year, Saudi Arabia abstained from the ratification vote on the Declaration, claiming that it violated Sharia law.[47] Pakistanwhich had signed the declarationdisagreed and critiqued the Saudi position.[48] Pakistani minister Muhammad Zafarullah Khan strongly argued in favor of including freedom of religion.[49] In 1982, the Iranian representative to the United Nations, Said Rajaie-Khorassani, said that the Declaration was \\"a secular understanding of the Judeo-Christian tradition\\" which could not be implemented by Muslims without conflict with Sharia.[50] On 30 June 2000, members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) officially resolved to support the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam,[51] an alternative document that says people have \\"freedom and right to a dignified life in accordance with the Islamic Shari'ah\\", without any discrimination on grounds of \\"race, colour, language, sex, religious belief, political affiliation, social status or other considerations\\".\\r\\nSome Muslim diplomats would go on later to help draft other UN human rights treaties. For example, Iraqi diplomat Bedia Afnan's insistence on wording that recognized gender equality resulted in Article 3 within the ICCPR and ICESCR. Pakistani diplomat Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah also spoke in favor of recognizing women's rights.[49]\\r\\nA number of scholars in different fields have expressed concerns with the Declaration's alleged Western bias. These include Irene Oh, Abdulaziz Sachedina, Riffat Hassan, and Faisal Kutty. Hassan has argued:\\r\\nWhat needs to be pointed out to those who uphold the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be the highest, or sole, model, of a charter of equality and liberty for all human beings, is that given the Western origin and orientation of this Declaration, the \\"universality\\" of the assumptions on which it is based is?ÿ at the very least?ÿ problematic and subject to questioning. Furthermore, the alleged incompatibility between the concept of human rights and religion in general, or particular religions such as Islam, needs to be examined in an unbiased way.[52]\\r\\nIrene Oh argues that one solution is to approach the issue from the perspective of comparative (descriptive) ethics.[53]\\r\\nKutty writes: \\"A strong argument can be made that the current formulation of international human rights constitutes a cultural structure in which western society finds itself easily at home ... It is important to acknowledge and appreciate that other societies may have equally valid alternative conceptions of human rights.\\"[54]\\r\\nIronically, a number of Islamic countries that as of 2014[update] are among the most resistant to UN intervention in domestic affairs, played an invaluable role in the creation of the Declaration, with countries such as Syria and Egypt having been strong proponents of the universality of human rights and the right of countries to self-determination.[55]\\r\\nGroups such as Amnesty International[56] and War Resisters International[57] have advocated for \\"The Right to Refuse to Kill\\" to be added to the Universal Declaration. War Resisters International has stated that the right to conscientious objection to military service is primarily derived frombut not yet explicit inArticle 18 of the UDHR: the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.[57]\\r\\nSteps have been taken within the United Nations to make this right more explicit, butto date (2017)[update]those steps have been limited to less significant United Nations documents. Sean MacBrideAssistant Secretary-General of the United Nations and Nobel Peace Prize laureatehas said: \\"To the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights one more might, with relevance, be added. It is 'The Right to Refuse to Kill'.\\"[58]\\r\\nThe American Anthropological Association criticized the UDHR while it was in its drafting process. The AAA warned that the document would be defining universal rights from a Western paradigm which would be unfair to countries outside of that scope. They further argued that the West's history of colonialism and evangelism made them a problematic moral representative for the rest of the world. They proposed three notes for consideration with underlying themes of cultural relativism: \\"1. The individual realizes his personality through his culture, hence respect for individual differences entails a respect for cultural differences\\", \\"2. Respect for differences between cultures is validated by the scientific fact that no technique of qualitatively evaluating cultures has been discovered\\", and \\"3. Standards and values are relative to the culture from which they derive so that any attempt to formulate postulates that grow out of the beliefs or moral codes of one culture must to that extent detract from the applicability of any Declaration of Human Rights to mankind as a whole.\\"[59]\\r\\nDuring the lead up to the World Conference on Human Rights held in 1993, ministers from Asian states adopted the Bangkok Declaration, reaffirming their governments' commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They stated their view of the interdependence and indivisibility of human rights and stressed the need for universality, objectivity, and non-selectivity of human rights. However, at the same time, they emphasized the principles of sovereignty and non-interference, calling for greater emphasis on economic, social, and cultural rightsin particular, the right to economic development over civil and political rights. The Bangkok Declaration is considered to be a landmark expression of the Asian values perspective, which offers an extended critique of human rights universalism.[60]\\r\\nThe International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) is nonpartisan, nonsectarian, and independent of any government, and its core mandate is to promote respect for all the rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.[61][62]\\r\\nIn 1988, director Stephen R. Johnson and 41 international animators, musicians, and producers created a 20-minute video for Amnesty International to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration. The video was to bring to life the Declaration's 30 articles.[63]\\r\\nAmnesty International celebrated Human Rights Day and the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration all over the world by organizing the \\"Fire Up!\\" event.[64]\\r\\nThe Unitarian Universalist Service Committee (UUSC) is a non-profit, nonsectarian organization whose work around the world is guided by the values of Unitarian Universalism and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It works to provide disaster relief and promote human rights and social justice around the world.\\r\\nThe Quaker United Nations Office and the American Friends Service Committee work on many human rights issues, including improving education on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They have developed a Curriculum to help introduce High School students to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[65][66]\\r\\nIn 1997, the council of the American Library Association (ALA) endorsed Article 19 from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[67] Along with Article 19, Article 18 and 20 are also fundamentally tied to the ALA Universal Right to Free Expression and the Library Bill of Rights.[68] Censorship, the invasion of privacy, and interference of opinions are human rights violations according to the ALA.\\r\\nIn response to violations of human rights, the ALA asserts the following principles:\\r\\nThe American Library Association condemns any governmental effort to involve libraries and librarians in restrictions on the right of any individual to hold opinions without interference, and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas. Such restrictions, whether enforced by statutes or regulations, contractual stipulations, or voluntary agreements, pervert the function of the library and violate the professional responsibilities of librarians.\\r\\nThe American Library Association rejects censorship in any form. Any action that denies the inalienable human rights of individuals only damages the will to resist oppression, strengthens the hand of the oppressor, and undermines the cause of justice.\\r\\nThe American Library Association will not abrogate these principles. We believe that censorship corrupts the cause of justice, and contributes to the demise of freedom.\\r\\n[69]\\r\\nYouth for Human Rights International (YHRI) is a non-profit organization founded in 2001 by Mary Shuttleworth, an educator born and raised in apartheid South Africa, where she witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of discrimination and the lack of basic human rights. The purpose of YHRI is to teach youth about human rights, specifically the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and inspire them to become advocates for tolerance and peace.

The school is a part of G.L.O.V.E., the Global League of Villainous Enterprises, and was built for the purpose of training children to become criminal masterminds. Only children who have already been seen to have some villainous skill are accepted to the school. The school has four streams; the Alpha stream, Henchmen stream, Technical stream and the Political/Financial stream. Each stream is associated with a color, and their uniforms reflect this. Alphas have black, Henchman has blue, Technical is white and Political/Financial is grey. Otto Malpense is a thirteen-year-old criminal genius, who has been handpicked along with others-the most intelligent, most athletic, technologically advanced children in the world to be part of H.I.V.E. In the first book Otto has entered the school; he discovers that it is not all what it seems, and sets out to unfold the mystery behind the school and its organization. Otto and his friends, Wing, Shelby, and Laura try to defy the headmaster, Dr. Maximilian Nero and try to accomplish something no one has ever succeeded in: escaping H.I.V.E. alive.\\r\\nH.I.V.E. has met with mostly favorable reviews. Jack Heath, author of Money Run, said that \\"if you can suspend your disbelief far enough, you will find it a rewarding read... The dialogue is witty, the plot twists deft, and the setting inventive, with plenty of knowing nods to the comic books and Bond films which pioneered the super villain tropes.\\"[2] The first book was given a score of 4/5 on abc.net.au, where it was praised as having \\"adventure, sacrifice, mystery, surprises and evil doings.\\"[3]\\r\\nAfter realising that the government funding that keeps the orphanage from closing down is being cut, Otto Malpense creates a remotely controlled device that is able to hack into the teleprompter and can hypnotise that he intends to use to publicly embarrass the Prime Minister during one of his speeches. After successfully completing his objective, he is ambushed and stunned by Raven (an assassin that works for H.I.V.E) and then awakes to find himself in a helicopter, strapped to his seat, and sitting across from a complete stranger. He finds out the stranger is named Wing Fanchu and they quickly become close friends. When the helicopter lands, Otto is informed that he will be spending the next six years of his life being schooled at H.I.V.E., the Higher Institute of Villainous Education. Dr. Nero, H.I.V.E's headmaster, is interested to know that it took more than two shots from Sleepers (knock-out weapons designed to replace tranquilizer darts) to capture Wing, enough to send a normal boy in a coma for a few weeks. He expresses his concerns to Raven and asks her to keep a close eye on Wing and Otto. Meanwhile, Otto's special skills have marked him out as an Alpha  a leader of tomorrow. He quickly works out that his little stunt with the Prime Minister now have landed Otto at H.I.V.E though he has no intention of staying in this new prison, and be friends many others who have been taken to H.I.V.E., like Laura Brand, Shelby Trinity, Nigel Darkdoom, and Franz Argentblum. Otto teams up with Wing, Laura, and Shelby, and together they hatch a daring escape plan. They travel through the hidden parts of the school, but as they nearly reach their freedom, their headmaster, Dr. Nero, reveals that all along they have been going on an impossible mission. However, Nigel Darkdoom has managed to stir up his own trouble on this night, and an enormous, flesh-eating plant (named Violet) he has accidentally bred escapes from the hydroponics lab. Everyone, including the students, jump into action to save the school, and they succeed (despite Dr. Nero and many others being injured). Otto and Wing are suddenly given a small window of opportunity to leave the school forever, but at the last second, they decide to stay. In the last chapter, it is revealed to the readers that Number One, Dr. Nero's boss and leader of G.L.O.V.E., in essence, has plans for Otto Malpense. Soon they will meet, and it will not be pretty.\\r\\nWhen Wing receives news of his father's death, he selects Otto to accompany him, under Raven's supervision, to the funeral . However, before they can attend the funeral, the trio is attacked by mysterious assassins. Wing appears to be shot by Cypher, a mysterious member of G.L.O.V.E. who wants to seize power and close H.I.V.E. Otto and Raven barely escape with their lives, and hide in one of Raven's numerous, personal safe houses while awaiting instructions from Dr. Nero. Raven is to attempt to discover what Cypher is up to, with Otto at her side. They discover the unbeatable adversaries they battled with at the original safe house to be robots, engineered for combat. Meanwhile, at H.I.V.E., a betrayal is revealed as the Contessa (a powerful teacher who can control people with her voice) takes over the school. Cypher makes an attack on the school, threatening to kill the students of H.I.V.E to get what he wants. In a sudden turn of events, Wing is found alive, having been shot by a tranquilizer disguised as a lethal bullet, and joins his friends in their attempt to save the school. Ultimately, they win the battle, leaving Cypher injured, but not fatally, and Nero insists that he be dead to everyone but himself and the doctor who treated the patient. Otto and his friends find out that Cypher is Wing's father, explaining his kidnapping Wing. In addition, during Dr. Nero's interrogation, Cypher reveals that his motive for attacking the school was a project named the Renaissance Initiative. This project seeks to recreate Overlord, a homicidal AI that wishes to kill everything on the planet. Cypher believed that with the Overlord Protocol (A device allowing him to hack everything on the planet), and H.I.V.E. as hostage, he could attack the Renaissance Initiative, revealed to be lead by no other than Number One. Otto and his friends find themselves glad to be out of danger and home for good, as well as excited that H.I.V.E.mind has had his personality functions restored.\\r\\nNero is kidnapped by H.O.P.E, the Hostile Operative Prosecution Executive, a new anti-terrorist organisation; and the Contessa takes over H.I.V.E. as headmaster with an elite guard known as the Phalanx. Otto, Wing, Laura, Shelby and Raven are forced to escape the school after being extracted by the Contessa and join forces with Diabolus Darkdoom - Nigel's supposedly traitorous dead father - who takes charge from a massive submarine known as the Megalodon. However, it soon emerges that Overlord, inside Number One's body, is behind the entire plot. Otto is Number One's clone, designed as a perfect host body for Overlord. They assault H.O.P.E in order to reclaim Nero, but are captured and sent into space, to Number One's hideout. Otto only narrowly escapes being taken over by Number One/Overlord, and is forced to delete H.I.V.E.mind in the process. Meanwhile, H.I.V.E. is under attack by the executioners known as the Reapers, the fights ensue as the teachers are shut out of H.I.V.E's systems, finally when all hope is lost the Contessa sacrifices herself to save the school by setting off a massive puddle of jet fuel.\\r\\nThe arrival of new student Lucy Dexter causes some confusion among the students, although they quickly befriend her. On their way to a training mission, they briefly visit the Dreadnought, a new mobile command center for G.L.O.V.E. However, the mission is cancelled when the Dreadnought becomes attacked by a rogue G.L.O.V.E. member. Nero, Raven and the students narrowly escape, but Diabolus Darkdoom is left behind and enemy agents that are sent after them.They soon discover that Lucy Dexter is actually the Contessa's Granddaughter and can control people with her voice, which is useful for the adventures they go on. They attempt to rescue Diabolus and foil the plan to use American weaponry, controlled by Air Force One, to set off a super-volcano and destroy civilization. While they succeed in rescuing Darkdoom, Otto must stay behind on an out-of-control Air Force One to disarm the weapon, and he passes out after being in a plane crash, leaving him in the custody of the U.S. Government. Trent speaks to the president then injects the Animus Fluid into Otto.\\r\\nOtto has been infected by Animus, an organic supercomputer which can be programmed by H.O.P.E. to make Otto do their evil bidding. With a superhuman assassin called Ghost, he attacks members of G.L.O.V.E. Raven is on her own mission to find Sebastian Trent, but first, goes to a facility where there might be people with information. She gets to Khan and threatens him, so he starts to unlock his computer. As he is typing in his password though, he is killed by a remote-controlled microexplosive device in his skull. She takes the laptop and just then, Nero picks her up to take her to the G.L.O.V.E. council meeting. At that meeting with the remaining G.L.O.V.E. members, who are waiting for Darkdoom to slip up, Darkdoom is pressured to make a decision. Eventually, Darkdoom issues a capture or kill order for Otto. During a later private meeting with Nero, Raven sees a sniper (Ghost) and just barely saves Darkdoom from being assassinated. While Darkdoom is in the H.I.V.E. medical center being healed, Professor Pike and Laura Brand try to fix the school's sporadic technical problems. Raven tries to hack through the Khan's laptop with Professor Pike's help, and she finds a picture of a seed in one picture. After consulting the biotechnology teacher, she discovers that this seed is most commonly found in the Amazon, which is where she is headed. Wing, who desperately wants to find Otto, stows away with her on the Shroud, but the pair of them are captured by H.O.P.E. Meanwhile, amidst the chaos at H.I.V.E., Nero brings another expert on artificial intelligencea newly freed Cypher, to help investigate. They believe it to be Overlord, but it is actually H.I.V.E.mind rebuilding himself. Organic supercomputers always automatically repair themselves as seed programs, and when they reach the self-awareness stage, they are able to control what they are doing.\\r\\nRaven's original purpose for going to the Amazon was also to seek the help of an old friend, who is shown to betray her. Carlos Chavez was essentially the ruler of Brazil and had pinpointed Raven's arrival. Chavez had enlisted a commander named Rafael, but Raven and Wing together defeat Rafael's men and Raven finishes Rafael by slicing his throat. After the mission failure, Chavez, knowingly defying Nero's wishes, even more, puts a priority one notice on the GLOVE.net for \\"Operation Raven,\\" which was to kill Raven. Lin Feng had supported Chavez's assassination attempt to kill Raven in order to prevent Nero from gaining power because Lin Feng knew Chavez was too unruly to actually control the council well, and that Lin Feng himself would take over G.L.O.V.E. eventually.\\r\\nCypher takes advantage of his freedom to seek out Wing at H.O.P.E.'s base, accompanied by Laura, Shelby, and Lucy as hostages that he took when he escaped. The girls escape him and free Raven, and when Otto begins to resist Animus (when he was told to kill Wing), Wing escapes to join them. When Otto distracts Ghost, Raven slices Ghost's head off, but Cypher finds the group and attempts to kill Otto in order to protect the world from Overlord. Cypher is shot dead by Wing, and Otto is nearly taken over by Overlord, but Laura uses the neural pulse device to eject Overlord and Animus from his system, nearly killing Otto in the process. Sebastian Trent attacks them, but he is taken over by Animus and subsequently killed, and Raven shoots him. The students return to H.I.V.E., where Otto recovers and tells Nero about some new information: Animus sought to destroy any organic material, but somehow with the Overlord, not H.I.V.E.mind (as Otto had once hoped), seed growing in him, the two fused together to become extremely powerful; every time Otto tried to hold them back, he himself weakened.\\r\\nBecause Darkdoom believes that his old idea of just ruling with respect wasn't good enough and that his injuries need more time to recover, he suggested Nero take over G.L.O.V.E. and add the touch of fear that Number One had. During their virtual meeting, with only 9 members, including Nero, remaining, G.L.O.V.E. was in peril. Nero proposes himself as the leader, but Lin Feng strongly opposes. With no other ally, because Raven killed Chavez, Lin Feng angrily leaves the council. It is shown later that Lin Feng is actually part of The Disciples, as he is talking to Pietor Furan about what had happened. Furan orders Lin Feng to apologize to Nero and regain his seat in G.L.O.V.E. Furan then tells Dr. Creed, whom he saved from the rainforest, to conduct an autopsy on Trent, who has been dead for 2 weeks. It is believed that the Animus would be inert, but it surprisingly lurches out and consumes Dr. Creed. The book is closed with a cliffhanger as the Overlord-Animus combination manages to survive in the doctor.\\r\\nOverlord has developed the power to move from body to body, if the body has been exposed to Animus. New machines have been developed but the first glimpse to the public brings terror as Overlord takes control of the facility (an Advanced Weapons facility in Colorado). He uses self-replicating Nanites which, if released will cause everyone to be a slave of Overlord. Then Raven is exposed to Animus. The four, along with Lucy, Nigel, Franz, Nero and Prof. Pike flee to the Megalodon, an enormous submarine that belongs to Darkdoom. The battle is nearing the end, and The Disciples, followers of Overlord, are winning. Nero and Darkdoom must call into action their final effort - Zero Hour, in a desperate battle to the death. Zero Hour involves all the most successful ex-Alphas, each out-fitted with brand-new machinery and gadgets. They have to fight, and Lucy ends up dying, in a sacrifice for Otto. She tells him, \\"There always has to be a choice.\\" The heroes survive, and it is obvious that Overlord is no more, but the organization that supports him is still very much there (the Disciples). Nero disbands the ruling council of G.L.O.V.E, telling them that they are a part of a \\"By-gone era\\".\\r\\nThe former members of the G.L.O.V.E. ruling council are outraged at Neros decision to disband the whole of the ruling council and create an entire new one, so they decide to join the Disciples in a plot to sabotage the H.I.V.E. training program called the Hunt. Nero dose not know the former council has joined The Disciples. Meanwhile, Dr. Nero has underestimated the cunning and resources of those who oppose him. Chief Dekker, the new Chief of Security at H.I.V.E. is actually a member of the Disciples (Overlords followers), who forces Laura to find out the location of the Hunt or she will get the Disciples to kill Lauras family. Laura manages to persuade Otto and the others to help her to steal the location of the Hunt, even though they do not know what Chief Dekker had forced their friend to do.\\r\\nWhen the Alphas set out to the Hunt, the Disciples were waiting for them. They murder fifteen Alpha students and kidnap the rest of them (including Laura, Nigel and the two new students, Tom and Penny- Otto's old friends) and they are taken to the mysterious assassin training facility called the Glasshouse by Anastasia Furan ÿ the new leader of the Disciples and a ghostly character from Ravens past. Luckily, Otto, Wing, Shelby and Franz manage to escape and return to H.I.V.E., but Otto ends up being expelled for his part in the stealing of the location of the Hunt. Dr Nero decides to make an agreement with Otto: if he, Raven and H.I.V.E.mind can track down the Disciples, then he will be allowed to return to H.I.V.E. The book ends with Raven and Otto traveling through Europe to asassinate Disciples. #Cliffhanger!\\r\\nOtto and Raven are desperate to rescue their friends from the clutches of Anastasia Furan, head of the evil Disciples organization. First they must track down the location of the Glasshouse, the prison where Furan trains children to become ruthless assassins. But Otto is also being hunted. The past three months that Otto has spent away from H.I.V.E. have given the Artemis Section an opportunity to locate him. The Artemis Section is an elite division of the American intelligence services that specializes in capturing the toughest targets. They report only to the President, which is very bad news for Otto. Anastasia Furan spent years trying to create a clone which looks like Otto named Zero. Otto kills Zero with the help of H.I.V.E. Mind, who transferred to the supercomputer inside Zero's head and the New Glasshouse is destroyed. Nero takes Anastasia and locks her beneath H.I.V.E. The book ends with Otto and Laura kissing and a short chapter at the end. Before, Zero had hinted at there being more clones. The short chapter shows a dozen or so cloning vats. Inside of each is a growing clone of Otto. There is a countdown above each vat.","input":"What is the first book in the hive series?"},{"output":"carnivore","context":"","input":"Is a t rex a carnivore or herbivore?"},{"output":"March 27, 2005","context":"","input":"When did the first episode of greys anatomy air?"},{"output":"1980s","context":"","input":"When did gps become available for civilian use?"},{"output":"across the river from Natchez","context":"?Canada: 96,145[1][2]\\r\\nThe Acadians (French: Acadiens, IPA:?[akadj??]) are the descendants of French colonists who settled in Acadia during the 17th and 18th centuries, some of whom are also descended from the Indigenous peoples of the region.[a][4] The colony was located in what is now Eastern Canada's Maritime provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island), as well as part of Quebec, and present-day Maine to the Kennebec River. Although today most of the Acadians and Qubcois are French-speaking (francophone) Canadians, Acadia was a distinctly separate colony of New France. It was geographically and administratively separate from the French colony of Canada (modern-day Quebec). As a result, the Acadians and Qubcois developed two distinct histories and cultures.[5] They also developed a slightly different French language. France has one official language and to accomplish this they have an administration in charge of the language. Since the Acadians were separated from this council, their French language evolved independently, and Acadians retain several elements of 17th-century French that have been lost in France. The settlers whose descendants became Acadians came from many areas in France, but especially regions such as ?le-de-France, Normandy, Brittany, Poitou and Aquitaine.[6] Acadian family names have come from many areas in France. For example, the Maillets are from Paris; the LeBlancs of Normandy; the surname Melanson is from Brittany, and those with the surnames Bastarache and Basque came from Aquitaine.\\r\\nDuring the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years' War), British colonial officers suspected Acadians were aligned with France after finding some Acadians fighting alongside French troops at Fort Beausejour. Though most Acadians remained neutral during the French and Indian War, the British, together with New England legislators and militia, carried out the Great Expulsion (Le Grand Drangement) of the Acadians during the 1755ÿ1764 period. They deported approximately 11,500 Acadians from the maritime region. Approximately one-third perished from disease and drowning.[7] The result was what one historian described as an ethnic cleansing of the Acadians from Maritime Canada. Other historians indicate that it was a deportation similar to other deportations of the time period.\\r\\nMost Acadians were deported to various American colonies, where many were forced into servitude, or marginal lifestyles. Some Acadians were deported to England, sent to the Caribbean, and some were deported to France. After being expelled to France, many Acadians were eventually recruited by the Spanish government to migrate to present day Louisiana state (known then as Spanish colonial Luisiana), where they developed what became known as Cajun culture.[8] In time, some Acadians returned to the Maritime provinces of Canada, mainly to New Brunswick because they were barred by the British from resettling their lands and villages in what became Nova Scotia. Before the US Revolutionary War, the Crown settled New England Planters in former Acadian communities and farmland as well as, after the war, Loyalists (including nearly 3,000 Black Loyalists, who were freed slaves). British policy was to assimilate Acadians with the local populations where they resettled.[7]\\r\\nAcadians speak a dialect of French called Acadian French. Many of those in the Moncton area speak Chiac and English. The Louisiana Cajun descendants speak a dialect of American English called Cajun English, with many also speaking Cajun French, a close relative of the original dialect from Canada influenced by Spanish and West African languages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the seventeenth century,[when?] about sixty French families were established in Acadia. They developed friendly relations with the Wabanaki Confederacy (particularly the Mi'kmaq), learning their hunting and fishing techniques. The Acadians lived mainly in the coastal regions of the Bay of Fundy; farming land reclaimed from the sea through diking. Living in a contested borderland region between French Quebec and British territories, the Acadians often became entangled in the conflict between the powers. Over a period of seventy-four years, six wars took place in Acadia and Nova Scotia in which the Confederacy and some Acadians fought to keep the British from taking over the region (See the four French and Indian Wars as well as Father Rale's War and Father Le Loutre's War).\\r\\nWhile France lost political control of Acadia in 1713, the M'kmaq did not concede land to the British. Along with some Acadians, the Mi'kmaq from time to time used military force to resist the British. This was particularly evident in the early 1720s during Dummer's War but hostilities were brought to a close by a treaty signed in 1726.\\r\\nThe British Conquest of Acadia happened in 1710. Over the next forty-five years the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. Many were influenced by Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre, who from his arrival in 1738 until his capture in 1755 preached against the 'English devils'.[9] During this time period Acadians participated in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour.[10] During the French and Indian War, the British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians posed and to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia.[11][12]\\r\\nWith the founding of Halifax in 1749 the Mi'kmaq resisted British (Protestant) settlements by making numerous raids on Halifax, Dartmouth, Lawrencetown and Lunenburg. During the French and Indian War, the Mi'kmaq assisted the Acadians in resisting the British during the Expulsion of the Acadians.[13]\\r\\nMany Acadians might have signed an unconditional oath to the British monarchy had the circumstances been better, while other Acadians did not sign because they were clearly anti-British.[14] For the Acadians who might have signed an unconditional oath, there were numerous reasons why they did not. The difficulty was partly religious, in that the British monarch was the head of the (Protestant) Church of England. Another significant issue was that an oath might commit male Acadians to fight against France during wartime. A related concern was whether their Mi'kmaq neighbours might perceive this as acknowledging the British claim to Acadia rather than the Mi'kmaq. As a result, signing an unconditional oath might have put Acadian villages in dangers of attack from Mi'kmaq.[15]\\r\\nIn the Great Expulsion (le Grand Drangement), after the Battle of Fort Beausjour beginning in August 1755 under Lieutenant Governor Lawrence, approximately 11,500 Acadians (three-quarters of the Acadian population in Nova Scotia) were expelled, their lands and property confiscated, and in some cases their homes burned. The Acadians were deported throughout the British eastern seaboard colonies from New England to Georgia. Although measures were taken during the embarkation of the Acadians to the transport ship, some families became split up. After 1758, thousands were transported to France. Most of the Acadians who went to Louisiana were transported there from France on five Spanish ships provided by the Spanish Crown to populate their Louisiana colony and provide farmers to supply New Orleans. The Spanish had hired agents to seek out the dispossessed Acadians in Brittany and the effort was kept secret so as not to anger the French King. These new arrivals from France joined the earlier wave expelled from Acadia, creating the Cajun population and culture.\\r\\nThe Spanish forced the Acadians they had transported to settle along the Mississippi River, to block British expansion, rather than Western Louisiana where many of them had family and friends and where it was much easier to farm. Rebels among them marched to New Orleans and ousted the Spanish governor. The Spanish later sent infantry from other colonies to put down the rebellion and execute the leaders. After the rebellion in December 1769 the Spanish Governor O'Reilly permitted the Acadians who had settled across the river from Natchez to resettle on the Iberville or Amite river closer to New Orleans.[16]\\r\\nA second and smaller expulsion occurred when the British took control of the North Shore of what is now New Brunswick. After the fall of Quebec the British lost interest and many Acadians returned to British North America, settling in coastal villages not occupied by American colonists. A few of these had evaded the British for several years but the brutal winter weather eventually forced them to surrender. Some returnees settled in the region of Fort Sainte-Anne, now Fredericton, but were later displaced by the arrival of the United Empire Loyalists after the American Revolution.\\r\\nIn 2003, at the request of Acadian representatives, Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada issued a Royal Proclamation acknowledging the deportation and establishing July 28 as an annual day of commemoration, beginning in 2005. The day is called the \\"Great Upheaval\\" on some English-language calendars.\\r\\nThe Acadians today live predominantly in the Canadian Maritime provinces, as well as parts of Quebec, Louisiana and Maine. In New Brunswick, Acadians inhabit the northern and eastern shores of New Brunswick, from Miscou Island (French: ?le Miscou) ?le Lamque including Caraquet in the center, all the way to Neguac in the southern part, Grande-Anse in the eastern part and Campbellton through to Saint-Quentin in the northern part. Other groups of Acadians can be found in the Magdalen Islands and throughout other parts of Quebec. Many Acadians still live in and around the area of Madawaska, Maine where the Acadians first landed and settled in what is now known as the St. John Valley. There are also Acadians in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia such as Chticamp, Isle Madame, and Clare. East and West Pubnico, located at the end of the province, are the oldest regions still Acadian.\\r\\nThe Acadians settled on the land before the deportation and returned to some of the same exact land after the deportation. Still others can be found in the southern and western regions of New Brunswick, Western Newfoundland and in New England. Many of these latter communities have faced varying degrees of assimilation. For many families in predominantly Anglophone communities, French-language attrition has occurred, particularly in younger generations.\\r\\nThe Acadians who settled in Louisiana after 1764, known as Cajuns, have had a dominant cultural influence in many parishes, particularly in the southwestern area of the state known as Acadiana.\\r\\nToday Acadians are a vibrant minority, particularly in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Louisiana (Cajuns), and northern Maine. Since 1994, Le Congrs Mondial Acadien has united Acadians of the Maritimes, New England, and Louisiana.\\r\\nAugust 15, the feast of the Assumption, was adopted as the national feast day of the Acadians at the First Acadian National Convention, held in Memramcook, New Brunswick in 1881. On that day, the Acadians celebrate by having the tintamarre which consists mainly of a big parade where people can dress up with the colours of Acadia and make a lot of noise.\\r\\nThe national anthem of the Acadians is \\"Ave, maris stella\\", adopted at Miscouche, Prince Edward Island in 1884. The anthem was revised at the 1992 meeting of the Socit Nationale de l'Acadie, where the second, third and fourth verses were changed to French, with the first and last kept in the original Latin.\\r\\nThe Federation des Associations de Familles Acadiennes of New Brunswick and the Socit Saint-Thomas d'Aquin of Prince Edward Island has resolved that December 13 each year shall be commemorated as \\"Acadian Remembrance Day\\" to commemorate the sinking of the Duke William and the nearly 2000 Acadians deported from Ile-Saint Jean who perished in the North Atlantic from hunger, disease and drowning in 1758.[17] The event has been commemorated annually since 2004 and participants mark the event by wearing a black star.\\r\\nToday, there are cartoons featuring Acadian characters and an Acadian show named Acadieman.\\r\\nIn 1847, American writer Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published Evangeline, an epic poem loosely based on the events surrounding the 1755 deportation. The poem became an American classic, and contributed to a rebirth of Acadian identity in both Maritime Canada and in Louisiana.\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, two statues were made of Evangeline, one in St. Martinville, Louisiana and the other in Grand-Pr, Nova Scotia, which both commemorate the Expulsion. Robbie Robertson wrote a popular song based on the Acadian Expulsion titled Acadian Driftwood, which appeared on The Band's 1975 album, Northern Lights ÿ Southern Cross.\\r\\nAntonine Maillet's Plagie-la-charette concerns the return voyage to Acadia of several deported families starting 15 years after the Great Expulsion.\\r\\nThe Acadian Memorial (Monument Acadien)[18] honors those 3,000 who settled in Louisiana.\\r\\nThroughout the Canadian Maritime Provinces there are Acadian Monuments to the Expulsion, such as the one at Georges Island (Nova Scotia) and Beaubears Island.\\r\\nThe flag of the Acadians is the French tricolour with a golden star in the blue field (see above), which symbolizes the Saint Mary, Our Lady of the Assumption, patron saint of the Acadians and the \\"Star of the Sea\\". This flag was adopted in 1884 at the Second Acadian National Convention, held in Miscouche, Prince Edward Island.\\r\\nAcadians in the diaspora have adopted other symbols. The flag of Acadians in Louisiana, known as Cajuns, was designed by Thomas J. Arceneaux of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and adopted by the Louisiana legislature as the official emblem of the Acadiana region in 1974.[19]\\r\\nA group of New England Acadians attending Le Congrs Mondial Acadien in Nova Scotia in 2004, endorsed a design for a New England Acadian flag[20] by William Cork, and are advocating for its wider acceptance.\\r\\nNotable Acadians in the 18th century include Noel Doiron (1684ÿ1758). Noel was one of more than 350 Acadians that perished on the Duke William on December 13, 1758.[21] Noel was described by the Captain of the Duke William as the \\"father of the whole island\\", a reference to Noel's place of prominence among the Acadian residents of Isle St. Jean (Prince Edward Island).[22] For his \\"noble resignation\\" and self-sacrifice aboard the Duke William, Noel was celebrated in popular print throughout the 19th century in England and America.[23][24][25] Noel also is the namesake of the village Noel, Nova Scotia.\\r\\nAnother prominent Acadian from the 18th century was militia leader Joseph Broussard who joined French priest Jean-Louis Le Loutre in resisting the British occupation of Acadia.\\r\\nMore recent notable Acadians include singers Angle Arsenault and Edith Butler, singer Jean-Fran?ois Breau, writer Antonine Maillet; film director Phil Comeau; singer-songwriter Julie Doiron; artist Phoebe Legere, boxers Yvon Durelle and Jacques LeBlanc; pitcher Rheal Cormier; former Governor General Romo LeBlanc; former premier of Prince Edward Island Aubin-Edmond Arsenault, the first Acadian premier of any province and the first Acadian appointed to a provincial supreme court; Aubin-Edmond Arsenault's father, Joseph-Octave Arsenault, the first Acadian appointed to the Canadian Senate from Prince Edward Island; Peter John Veniot, first Acadian Premier of New Brunswick; and former New Brunswick premier Louis Robichaud, who was responsible for modernizing education and the government of New Brunswick in the mid-20th century.\\r\\nProminent Louisiana Acadians include Senator Dudley J.

As part of its statutory management function the Agency permitted the public to use the Parks for recreational purposes, subject to regulations issued under the Parks Regulation Acts 1872ÿ1926 which were considered necessary to secure proper management, preserve order and prevent abuse within the Parks.

Historically the Dream originated in the mystique regarding frontier life. As the Governor of Virginia noted in 1774, the Americans \\"for ever imagine the Lands further off are still better than those upon which they are already settled\\". He added that, \\"if they attained Paradise, they would move on if they heard of a better place farther west\\".[3]\\r\\nIn the 19th?century, many well-educated Germans fled the failed 1848 revolution. They welcomed the political freedoms in the New World, and the lack of a hierarchical or aristocratic society that determined the ceiling for individual aspirations. One of them explained:\\r\\nThe German emigrant comes into a country free from the despotism, privileged orders and monopolies, intolerable taxes, and constraints in matters of belief and conscience. Everyone can travel and settle wherever he pleases. No passport is demanded, no police mingles in his affairs or hinders his movements?... Fidelity and merit are the only sources of honor here. The rich stand on the same footing as the poor; the scholar is not a mug above the most humble mechanics; no German ought to be ashamed to pursue any occupation?... [In America] wealth and possession of real estate confer not the least political right on its owner above what the poorest citizen has. Nor are there nobility, privileged orders, or standing armies to weaken the physical and moral power of the people, nor are there swarms of public functionaries to devour in idleness credit for. Above all, there are no princes and corrupt courts representing the so-called divine 'right of birth.' In such a country the talents, energy and perseverance of a person?... have far greater opportunity to display than in monarchies.[4]\\r\\nThe discovery of gold in California in 1849 brought in a hundred thousand men looking for their fortune overnightand a few did find it. Thus was born the California Dream of instant success. Historian H. W. Brands noted that in the years after the Gold Rush, the California Dream spread across the nation:\\r\\nThe old American Dream?... was the dream of the Puritans, of Benjamin Franklin's \\"Poor Richard\\"...?of men and women content to accumulate their modest fortunes a little at a time, year by year by year. The new dream was the dream of instant wealth, won in a twinkling by audacity and good luck. [This] golden dream?... became a prominent part of the American psyche only after Sutter's Mill.\\"[5]\\r\\nHistorian Frederick Jackson Turner in 1893 advanced the Frontier Thesis, under which American democracy and the American Dream were formed by the American frontier. He stressed the processthe moving frontier lineand the impact it had on pioneers going through the process. He also stressed results; especially that American democracy was the primary result, along with egalitarianism, a lack of interest in high culture, and violence. \\"American democracy was born of no theorist's dream; it was not carried in the Susan Constant to Virginia, nor in the Mayflower to Plymouth. It came out of the American forest, and it gained new strength each time it touched a new frontier,\\" said Turner.[6] In the thesis, the American frontier established liberty by releasing Americans from European mindsets and eroding old, dysfunctional customs. The frontier had no need for standing armies, established churches, aristocrats or nobles, nor for landed gentry who controlled most of the land and charged heavy rents. Frontier land was free for the taking. Turner first announced his thesis in a paper entitled \\"The Significance of the Frontier in American History\\", delivered to the American Historical Association in 1893 in Chicago. He won wide acclaim among historians and intellectuals. Turner elaborated on the theme in his advanced history lectures and in a series of essays published over the next 25 years, published along with his initial paper as The Frontier in American History.[7] Turner's emphasis on the importance of the frontier in shaping American character influenced the interpretation found in thousands of scholarly histories. By the time Turner died in 1932, 60% of the leading history departments in the U.S. were teaching courses in frontier history along Turnerian lines.[8]\\r\\nFreelance writer James Truslow Adams popularized the phrase \\"American Dream\\" in his 1931 book Epic of America:\\r\\nBut there has been also the American dream, that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for every man, with opportunity for each according to his ability or achievement. It is a difficult dream for the European upper classes to interpret adequately, and too many of us ourselves have grown weary and mistrustful of it. It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position... The American dream, that has lured tens of millions of all nations to our shores in the past century has not been a dream of merely material plenty, though that has doubtlessly counted heavily. It has been much more than that. It has been a dream of being able to grow to fullest development as man and woman, unhampered by the barriers which had slowly been erected in the older civilizations, unrepressed by social orders which had developed for the benefit of classes rather than for the simple human being of any and every class.[1]\\r\\nMartin Luther King,?Jr., in his \\"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\\" (1963) rooted the civil rights movement in the African-American quest for the American Dream:[9]\\r\\nWe will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands?... when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judeo-Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.\\r\\nThe concept is used in popular discourse, and scholars have traced its use in American literature ranging from the Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,[10] to Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), Willa Cather's My ntonia,[11] F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925), Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy (1925) and Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon (1977).[12] Other writers who used the American Dream theme include Hunter S. Thompson, Edward Albee,[13] John Steinbeck,[14] Langston Hughes[15] and Giannina Braschi.[16] The American Dream is also discussed in Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman; the play's protagonist, Willy, is on a quest for the American Dream.\\r\\nAs Huang shows, the American Dream is a recurring theme in the fiction of Asian Americans.[17][18]\\r\\nMany American authors added American Ideals to their work as a theme or other reoccurring idea, to get their point across.[19] There are many ideals that appear in American Literature such as, but not limited to, all people are equal, The United States of America is the Land of Opportunity, independence is valued, The American Dream is attainable, and everyone can succeed with hard work and determination. John Winthrop also wrote about this term called, American Exceptionalism. This ideology refers to the idea that Americans are the chosen ones, and that they are the light.[20]\\r\\nThe American Dream has been credited with helping to build a cohesive American experience, but has also been blamed for inflated expectations.[22] Some commentators have noted that despite deep-seated belief in the egalitarian American Dream, the modern American wealth structure still perpetuates racial and class inequalities between generations.[23] One sociologist notes that advantage and disadvantage are not always connected to individual successes or failures, but often to prior position in a social group.[23]\\r\\nSince the 1920s, numerous authors, such as Sinclair Lewis in his 1922 novel Babbitt, and F.?Scott Fitzgerald, in his 1925 classic, The Great Gatsby, satirized or ridiculed materialism in the chase for the American dream. For example, Jay Gatsby's death mirrors the American Dream's demise, reflecting the pessimism of modern-day Americans.[24] The American Dream is a main theme in the book by John Steinbeck, Of Mice and Men. The two friends George and Lennie dream of their own piece of land with a ranch, so they can \\"live off the fatta the lan'\\" and just enjoy a better life. The book later shows that not everyone can achieve the American Dream, thus proving by contradiction it is not possible for all, although it is possible to achieve for a few. A lot of people follow the American Dream to achieve a greater chance of becoming rich. Some posit that the ease of achieving the American Dream changes with technological advances, availability of infrastructure and information, government regulations, state of the economy, and with the evolving cultural values of American demographics.\\r\\nIn 1949, Arthur Miller wrote Death of a Salesman, in which the American Dream is a fruitless pursuit. Similarly, in 1971 Hunter S. Thompson depicted in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey Into the Heart of the American Dream a dark psychedelic reflection of the conceptsuccessfully illustrated only in wasted pop-culture excess.[25]\\r\\nThe novel Requiem for a Dream by Hubert Selby,?Jr. is an exploration of the pursuit of American success as it turns delirious and lethal, told through the ensuing tailspin of its main characters. George Carlin famously wrote the joke \\"it's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it\\".[26] Carlin pointed to \\"the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions\\" as having a greater influence than an individual's choice.[26] Pulitzer Prizeÿwinning journalist Chris Hedges echos this sentiment in his 2012 book Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt:[27]\\r\\nThe vaunted American dream, the idea that life will get better, that progress is inevitable if we obey the rules and work hard, that material prosperity is assured, has been replaced by a hard and bitter truth. The American dream, we now know, is a lie. We will all be sacrificed. The virus of corporate abuse - the perverted belief that only corporate profit matters - has spread to outsource our jobs, cut the budgets of our schools, close our libraries, and plague our communities with foreclosures and unemployment.\\r\\nThe American Dream, and the sometimes dark response to it, has been a long-standing theme in American film.[28] Many counterculture films of the 1960s and 1970s ridiculed the traditional quest for the American Dream. For example, Easy Rider (1969), directed by Dennis Hopper, shows the characters making a pilgrimage in search of \\"the true America\\" in terms of the hippie movement, drug use, and communal lifestyles.[29]\\r\\nScholars have explored the American Dream theme in the careers of numerous political leaders, including Henry Kissinger,[30] Hillary Clinton,[31] Benjamin Franklin, and Abraham Lincoln.[32] The theme has been used for many local leaders as well, such as Jos Antonio Navarro, the Tejano leader (1795ÿ1871), who served in the legislatures of Coahuila y Texas, the Republic of Texas, and the State of Texas.[33]\\r\\nIn 2006 U.S.?Senator Barack Obama wrote a memoir, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream. It was this interpretation of the American Dream for a young black man that helped establish his statewide and national reputations.[34][35] The exact meaning of the Dream became for at least one commentator a partisan political issue in the 2008 and 2012 elections.[36]\\r\\nPolitical conflicts, to some degree, have been ameliorated by the shared values of all parties in the expectation that the American Dream will resolve many difficulties and conflicts.[37]\\r\\nThe ethos today implies an opportunity for Americans to achieve prosperity through hard work. According to The Dream, this includes the opportunity for one's children to grow up and receive a good education and career without artificial barriers. It is the opportunity to make individual choices without the prior restrictions that limited people according to their class, caste, religion, race, or ethnicity. Immigrants to the United States sponsored ethnic newspapers in their own language; the editors typically promoted the American Dream.[38] Lawrence Samuel argues:\\r\\nFor many in both the working class and the middle class, upward mobility has served as the heart and soul of the American Dream, the prospect of \\"betterment\\" and to \\"improve one's lot\\" for oneself and one's children much of what this country is all about. \\"Work hard, save a little, send the kids to college so they can do better than you did, and retire happily to a warmer climate\\" has been the script we have all been handed.[39]\\r\\nA key element of the American Dream is promoting opportunity for one's children, Johnson interviewing parents says, \\"This was one of the most salient features of the interview data: parentsregardless of backgroundrelied heavily on the American Dream to understand the possibilities for children, especially their own children\\".[40] Rank et al. argue, \\"The hopes and optimism that Americans possess pertain not only to their own lives, but to their children's lives as well. A fundamental aspect of the American Dream has always been the expectation that the next generation should do better than the previous generation.\\"[41]\\r\\nHanson and Zogby (2010) report on numerous public opinion polls that since the 1980s have explored the meaning of the concept for Americans, and their expectations for its future. In these polls, a majority of Americans consistently reported that for their family, the American Dream is more about spiritual happiness than material goods. Majorities state that working hard is the most important element for getting ahead. However, an increasing minority stated that hard work and determination does not guarantee success. Most Americans predict that achieving the Dream with fair means will become increasingly difficult for future generations. They are increasingly pessimistic about the opportunity for the working class to get ahead; on the other hand, they are increasingly optimistic about the opportunities available to poor people and to new immigrants. Furthermore, most support programs make special efforts to help minorities get ahead.[42]\\r\\nIn a 2013 poll by a YouGov, 41% of responders said it is impossible for most to achieve the American Dream, while 38% said it is still possible.[43] Most Americans perceive a college education as the ticket to the American Dream.[44] Some recent observers warn that soaring student loan debt crisis and shortages of good jobs may undermine this ticket.[45] The point was illustrated in The Fallen American Dream,[46] a documentary film that details the concept of the American Dream from its historical origins to its current perception.\\r\\nResearch published in 2013 shows that the US provides, alongside the United Kingdom and Spain, the least economic mobility of any of 13 rich, democratic countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.[47][48] Prior research suggested that the United States shows roughly average levels of occupational upward mobility and shows lower rates of income mobility than comparable societies.[49][50] Blanden et al. report, \\"the idea of the US as 'the land of opportunity' persists; and clearly seems misplaced.\\"[51] According to these studies, \\"by international standards, the United States has an unusually low level of intergenerational mobility: our parents' income is highly predictive of our incomes as adults. Intergenerational mobility in the United States is lower than in France, Germany, Sweden, Canada, Finland, Norway and Denmark. Research in 2006 found that among high-income countries for which comparable estimates are available, only the United Kingdom had a lower rate of mobility than the United States.\\"[52] Economist Isabel Sawhill concluded that \\"this challenges the notion of America as the land of opportunity\\".[53][54][55] Several public figures and commentators, from David Frum to Richard G. Wilkinson, have noted that the American dream is better realized in Denmark, which is ranked as having the highest social mobility in the OECD.[56][57][58][59][60] In 2015, economist Joseph Stiglitz stated, \\"Maybe we should be calling the American Dream the Scandinavian Dream.\\"[61]\\r\\nIn the United States, home ownership is sometimes used as a proxy for achieving the promised prosperity; ownership has been a status symbol separating the middle classes from the poor.[62]\\r\\nSometimes the Dream is identified with success in sports or how working class immigrants seek to join the American way of life.[63]\\r\\nOwnby (1999) identifies four American Dreams that the new consumer culture addressed. The first was the \\"Dream of Abundance\\" offering a cornucopia of material goods to all Americans, making them proud to be the richest society on earth. The second was the \\"Dream of a Democracy of Goods\\" whereby everyone had access to the same products regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, or class, thereby challenging the aristocratic norms of the rest of the world whereby only the rich or well-connected are granted access to luxury. The \\"Dream of Freedom of Choice\\" with its ever-expanding variety of good allowed people to fashion their own particular lifestyle. Finally, the \\"Dream of Novelty\\", in which ever-changing fashions, new models, and unexpected new products broadened the consumer experience in terms of purchasing skills and awareness of the market, and challenged the conservatism of traditional society and culture, and even politics. Ownby acknowledges that the dreams of the new consumer culture radiated out from the major cities, but notes that they quickly penetrated the most rural and most isolated areas, such as rural Mississippi. With the arrival of the model?T after 1910, consumers in rural America were no longer locked into local general stores with their limited merchandise and high prices in comparison to shops in towns and cities. Ownby demonstrates that poor black Mississippians shared in the new consumer culture, both inside Mississippi, and it motivated the more ambitious to move to Memphis or Chicago.[64][65]\\r\\nThe aspirations of the \\"American Dream\\" in the broad sense of upward mobility has been systematically spread to other nations since the 1890s as American missionaries and businessmen consciously sought to spread the Dream, says Rosenberg. Looking at American business, religious missionaries, philanthropies, Hollywood, labor unions and Washington agencies, she says they saw their mission not in catering to foreign elites but instead reaching the world's masses in democratic fashion. \\"They linked mass production, mass marketing, and technological improvement to an enlightened democratic spirit?... In the emerging litany of the American dream what historian Daniel Boorstin later termed a \\"democracy of things\\" would disprove both Malthus's predictions of scarcity and Marx's of class conflict.\\" It was, she says \\"a vision of global social progress.\\"[66] Rosenberg calls the overseas version of the American Dream \\"liberal-developmentalism\\" and identified five critical components:\\r\\n(1) belief that other nations could and should replicate America's own developmental experience; (2) faith in private free enterprise; (3) support for free or open access for trade and investment; (4) promotion of free flow of information and culture; and (5) growing acceptance of [U.S.] governmental activity to protect private enterprise and to stimulate and regulate American participation in international economic and cultural exchange.[67]\\r\\nKnights and McCabe argued American management gurus have taken the lead in exporting the ideas: \\"By the latter half of the twentieth century they were truly global and through them the American Dream continues to be transmitted, repackaged and sold by an infantry of consultants and academics backed up by an artillery of books and videos\\".[68]\\r\\nIn West Germany after World War II, says Pommerin, \\"the most intense motive was the longing for a better life, more or less identical with the American dream, which also became a German dream\\".[69] Cassamagnaghi argues that to women in Italy after 1945, films and magazine stories about American life offered an \\"American dream.\\" New York City especially represented a sort of utopia where every sort of dream and desire could become true. Italian women saw a model for their own emancipation from second class status in their patriarchal society.[70]\\r\\nThe American dream regarding home ownership had little resonance before the 1980s.[71] In the 1980s, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher worked to create a similar dream, by selling public-housing units to their tenants. Her Conservative Party called for more home ownership: \\"HOMES OF OUR OWN: To most people ownership means first and foremost a home of their own?... We should like in time to improve on existing legislation with a realistic grants scheme to assist first-time buyers of cheaper homes.\\"[72] Guest calls this Thatcher's approach to the American Dream.[73] Knights and McCabe argue that, \\"a reflection and reinforcement of the American Dream has been the emphasis on individualism as extolled by Margaret Thatcher and epitomized by the 'enterprise' culture.\\"[74]\\r\\nSince the fall of Communism in the Soviet Union in 1991, the American Dream has fascinated Russians.[75] The first post-Communist leader Boris Yeltsin embraced the \\"American way\\" and teamed up with Harvard University free market economists Jeffrey Sachs and Robert Allison to give Russia economic shock therapy in the 1990s. The newly independent Russian media idealized America and endorsed shock therapy for the economy.[76] In 2008 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev lamented the fact that 77% of Russia's 142?million people live \\"cooped up\\" in apartment buildings. In 2010 his administration announced a plan for widespread home ownership: \\"Call it the Russian dream\\", said Alexander Braverman, the Director of the Federal Fund for the Promotion of Housing Construction Development. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, worried about his nation's very low birth rate, said he hoped home ownership will inspire Russians \\"to have more babies\\".[77]\\r\\nThe Chinese Dream describes a set of ideals in the People's Republic of China. It is used by journalists, government officials and activists to describe the aspiration of individual self-improvement in Chinese society. Although the phrase has been used previously by Western journalists and scholars,[78][79] a translation of a New York Times article written by the American journalist Thomas Friedman, \\"China Needs Its Own Dream\\", has been credited with popularizing the concept in China.[79] He attributes the term to Peggy Liu and the environmental NGO JUCCCE's China Dream project,[80][81] which defines the Chinese Dream as sustainable development.[81] In 2013 the President of the PRC Xi Jinping began promoting the phrase as a slogan, leading to its widespread use in the Chinese media.[82]\\r\\nThe concept of Chinese Dream is very similar to the idea of \\"American Dream\\". It stresses entrepreneurship and glorifies a generation of self-made men and women in post-reform China. Such as those rural immigrates who moved to the urban centers and achieve magnificent improvement in terms of their living standards, and social life. Chinese Dream can be interpreted as the collective consciousness of Chinese people during the era of social transformation and economic progress.\\r\\nThe idea was put forward by the new CPC General Secretary Xi Jinping on November 29, 2012. The government hoped to create a revitalized China, while promoting innovation and technology to restore the international prestige of China. In this light, Chinese Dream, like American exceptionalism, is a nationalistic concept as well.","input":"What was the idea of the american dream?"},{"output":"lifetime tenure unless they resign, retire, or are removed after impeachment (though no justice has ever been removed)","context":"","input":"How long do supreme court justices hold their jobs?"},{"output":"6.5 years","context":"Dolly (5 July 1996 ÿ 14 February 2003) was a female domestic sheep, and the first mammal cloned from an adult somatic cell, using the process of nuclear transfer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDolly was cloned by Keith Campbell, Ian Wilmut and colleagues at the Roslin Institute, part of the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, and the biotechnology company PPL Therapeutics, based near Edinburgh. The funding for Dolly's cloning was provided by PPL Therapeutics and the UK's Ministry of Agriculture.[2] She was born on 5 July 1996 and died from a progressive lung disease five months before her seventh birthday.[3] She has been called \\"the world's most famous sheep\\" by sources including BBC News and Scientific American.[4][5]\\r\\nThe cell used as the donor for the cloning of Dolly was taken from a mammary gland, and the production of a healthy clone therefore proved that a cell taken from a specific part of the body could recreate a whole individual. On Dolly's name, Wilmut stated \\"Dolly is derived from a mammary gland cell and we couldn't think of a more impressive pair of glands than Dolly Parton's\\".[1]\\r\\nDolly was born on 5 July 1996 and had three mothers (one provided the egg, another the DNA and a third carried the cloned embryo to term).[6] She was created using the technique of somatic cell nuclear transfer, where the cell nucleus from an adult cell is transferred into an unfertilized oocyte (developing egg cell) that has had its cell nucleus removed. The hybrid cell is then stimulated to divide by an electric shock, and when it develops into a blastocyst it is implanted in a surrogate mother.[7] Dolly was the first clone produced from a cell taken from an adult mammal.[8][9] The production of Dolly showed that genes in the nucleus of such a mature differentiated somatic cell are still capable of reverting to an embryonic totipotent state, creating a cell that can then go on to develop into any part of an animal.[10] Dolly's existence was announced to the public on 22 February 1997.[1] It gained much attention in the media. A commercial with Scottish scientists playing with sheep was aired on TV, and a special report in TIME Magazine featured Dolly the sheep.[2] Science featured Dolly as the breakthrough of the year. Even though Dolly was not the first animal cloned, she received media attention because she was the first cloned from an adult cell.[11]\\r\\nDolly lived her entire life at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh.[12] There she was bred with a Welsh Mountain ram and produced six lambs in total. Her first lamb, named Bonnie, was born in April 1998.[3] The next year Dolly produced twin lambs Sally and Rosie, and she gave birth to triplets Lucy, Darcy and Cotton in the year after that.[13] In late 2001, at the age of four, Dolly developed arthritis and began to walk stiffly. This was treated with anti-inflammatory drugs.[14]\\r\\nOn 14 February 2003, Dolly was euthanised because she had a progressive lung disease and severe arthritis.[15] A Finn Dorset such as Dolly has a life expectancy of around 11 to 12 years, but Dolly lived 6.5 years. A post-mortem examination showed she had a form of lung cancer called ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma, also known as Jaagsiekte,[16] which is a fairly common disease of sheep and is caused by the retrovirus JSRV.[17] Roslin scientists stated that they did not think there was a connection with Dolly being a clone, and that other sheep in the same flock had died of the same disease.[15] Such lung diseases are a particular danger for sheep kept indoors, and Dolly had to sleep inside for security reasons.\\r\\nSome in the press speculated that a contributing factor to Dolly's death was that she could have been born with a genetic age of six years, the same age as the sheep from which she was cloned.[18] One basis for this idea was the finding that Dolly's telomeres were short, which is typically a result of the aging process.[19][20] The Roslin Institute stated that intensive health screening did not reveal any abnormalities in Dolly that could have come from advanced aging.[18]\\r\\nIn 2016 scientists reported no defects in thirteen cloned sheep, including four from the same cell line as Dolly. The first study to review the long-term health outcomes of cloning, the authors found no evidence of late-onset, non-communicable diseases other than some minor examples of osteoarthritis and concluded \\"We could find no evidence, therefore, of a detrimental long-term effect of cloning by SCNT on the health of aged offspring among our cohort.\\"[21][22]\\r\\nAfter cloning was successfully demonstrated through the production of Dolly, many other large mammals were cloned, including pigs,[23][24] deer,[25] horses[26] and bulls.[27] The attempt to clone argali (mountain sheep) did not produce viable embryos. The attempt to clone a banteng bull was more successful, as were the attempts to clone mouflon (a form of wild sheep), both resulting in viable offspring.[28] The reprogramming process that cells need to go through during cloning is not perfect and embryos produced by nuclear transfer often show abnormal development.[29][30] Making cloned mammals was highly inefficient ÿ in 1996 Dolly was the only lamb that survived to adulthood from 277 attempts. By 2014 Chinese scientists were reported to have 70ÿ80% success rates cloning pigs[24] and in 2016, a Korean company, Sooam Biotech, was producing 500 cloned embryos a day.[31] Wilmut, who led the team that created Dolly, announced in 2007 that the nuclear transfer technique may never be sufficiently efficient for use in humans.[32]\\r\\nCloning may have uses in preserving endangered species and may become a viable tool for reviving extinct species.[33] In January 2009, scientists from the Centre of Food Technology and Research of Aragon, in northern Spain announced the cloning of the Pyrenean ibex, a form of wild mountain goat, which was officially declared extinct in 2000. Although the newborn ibex died shortly after birth due to physical defects in its lungs, it is the first time an extinct animal has been cloned, and may open doors for saving endangered and newly extinct species by resurrecting them from frozen tissue.[34][35]\\r\\nIn July 2016, four identical clones of Dolly (Daisy, Debbie, Dianna, and Denise) were alive and healthy at nine years old.[36][37]\\r\\nScientific American concluded in 2016 that the main legacy of Dolly the sheep has not been cloning of animals but in advances into stem cell research.[38] After Dolly, researchers realised that ordinary cells could be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells which can be grown into any tissue.[39]","input":"How long did the cloned sheep dolly live?"},{"output":"Spanish","context":"","input":"What is the official language in the dominican republic?"},{"output":"the series premiere \\"Days Gone Bye\\"","context":"Morgan Jones is a fictional character from the comic book series The Walking Dead and is portrayed by Lennie James in the American television series of the same name and its companion series Fear the Walking Dead. In both the comics and television series, he is a devoted father struggling to get over the recent death of his wife. He and his son, Duane, seek refuge in Rick's hometown after the outbreak occurs and are the first survivors that Rick encounters after awakening from his coma.\\r\\nIn the TV series, Morgan saves Ricks life from a walker and tells him about the outbreak. They part ways with the intention of reuniting in Atlanta but then they lose contact. In the season 3 episode \\"Clear,\\" Morgan is revealed to be alive when Rick encounters him on a supply run back in Rick's hometown. Morgan has become mentally unstable as Duane was killed by Morgan's undead wife, and refuses to rejoin Rick's group insisting that he needs to stay and clear the town of walkers. In season 5, Morgan is shown to have recovered from his mental break and learns that Rick is in Virginia. He eventually finds the Alexandria Safe-Zone and reunites with his old friend. In season 6 Morgan acts as a man of peace, insisting they can resolve threats without the use of violence, which conflicts with Rick's views, and tries to help him regain his humanity when it continually diminishes. A flashback episode \\"Here's Not Here\\" reveals that after encountering Rick the second time, Morgan met a survivor named Eastman who helped him recover from his mental break, teaching him aikido and insisting he doesn't have to kill people no matter the situation. The ongoing war diminishes Morgan's strive for peace, and he reverts back to killing. By the end of the war, he leaves Washington DC. It was decided to transfer his character to the companion series Fear The Walking Dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMorgan's son, Duane, spots Rick wandering around their house and, mistaking him for a walker, knocks him out with a shovel. Morgan quickly comes to the realization that Rick is a living human and aids him back to health. He provides details to Rick of the outbreak and what has been happening within the world the past couple months. Rick later supplies him and his son with guns from the Sheriff's station to ensure their protection, and then departs from them to Atlanta.[1]\\r\\nMorgan and Duane are later shown still remaining within their house several months afterward, during the winter. In an attempt to preserve old tradition and celebrate Christmas with Duane to lift his spirits, Morgan is able to find a Game Boy from a nearby store and give it to him as a present.[2]\\r\\nSometime within the following months, Duane falls prey to the walkers and gets turned. Morgan, unable to cope with the death of his son, resorts to locking Duane in the house with chains. As his mental and physical health deteriorates, he begins murdering survivors who pass by so he can feed the boy. Rick, along with his son Carl and new second-in-command Abraham, arrive back to the town with the plan to bring Morgan into the group, which he agrees to after freeing his zombie son.[3] He quickly develops an intense fixation on Carl, who reminds him of Duane.[4] While in the group, he becomes one of the primary defenders of their campsite, and deepens his bond with Michonne, the two of them both connecting due to their damaged psyches and history of loss.[5] At the same time, he attempts to deepen his bond with Carl after witnessing first-hand the boy's cold-blooded mentality.[6] He believes himself to be responsible for maintaining Carl's childhood innocence and is determined to make amends for his failure to protect Duane.\\r\\nOnce arriving at the new walled-in community named the Alexandria Safe-Zone, he was assigned by the leader Douglas the role of being a chef. He and the rest of the survivors enjoyed the resources that the community offered, however he was one of the few who found himself frustrated with the fake upbeat attitude of their surroundings. After he and Michonne leave the welcome party hosted by the townspeople, the two finally engage in sex.[7] He deeply regrets his actions the following morning, believing himself to be an adulterer and continuing to cling to the memory of his deceased wife. His burdening of ill-conceived principles and refusal to let go of the past angers Michonne, despite their growing attraction towards one another.[8]\\r\\nMorgan later apologizes for the hindrance in their relationship and reassures her that he is trying the best he can to get over all that has happened. She accepts[9] and the two are able to reunite as lovers once more.[10] Tension between the two of them develops again however, as Michonne becomes insulted by his egocentric demeanor when he justifies their sexual activities as him deserving to be happy.[11]\\r\\nWhile helping fight off zombies with Rick, Morgan is caught off guard and bitten on the arm by a walker.[12] Michonne chops his arm off, and from there he is left bedridden. He confesses to Carl his knowledge of the murder committed by him and pleads for him not to let darkness overcome his morality.[13] Michonne later tries to make amends with him, only to discover that he has died from blood-loss. He is shortly thereafter put down by her before he has the chance to re-animate.[14]\\r\\nIn the television series, Rick's hometown - where the Jones' settle - is a small Georgia town called King County. In the series premiere \\"Days Gone Bye\\", Morgan examines Rick after his son Duane mistakes Rick for a walker and hits him with a shovel. Rick later wakes up tied to a bed, as Morgan checks Rick for zombie bites or fever, either of which could indicate he is turning into a walker. Morgan initially doubts Rick's status as a living being, going so far as to threaten to shoot him if he does not prove his humanity. After deciding Rick is not a threat, Morgan frees him using a Buck 110 hunting knife and shares what information he has regarding the apocalypse and the walkers. The following day, Rick tells Morgan that his wife and son are missing and they are most likely alive, since the family photos have been taken from the house. Morgan and Duane tell Rick they may have set off to Atlanta, where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has set up a quarantine zone. Rick takes Morgan and Duane to his former Sheriff's headquarters, where the trio use the emergency generator to power up the station. They take hot showers and clean out the armory. Rick heads to Atlanta, while Morgan and Duane stay behind. Rick gives Morgan a rifle and a walkie-talkie and promises to broadcast every morning at dawn. Morgan goes to the top floor of his house, where he looks through old family photos before shooting several zombies. As he hoped, the noise attracts more walkers, including his dead wife Jenny, but Morgan finds himself unable to shoot her and breaks down in tears.\\r\\nIn the episode \\"Clear\\", when Rick, Carl, and Michonne go on a run into King County, Morgan holds them at gunpoint from a roof. They have a shootout, and while trying to pursue Rick, Carl ultimately shoots Morgan in the chest. Rick pulls off Morgan's shirt, revealing that he had donned body armor. They drag his unconscious-self into his building, avoiding his traps, and lay him down on a bed. For safety measures, his hands are bound by Rick. While Rick is reading the strange writings on the wall, he discovers that Duane had reanimated, and decides to stay and wait for Morgan to wake up. While Michonne and Carl go on a run, Rick waits for him to wake up, but Morgan grabs a knife that was taped to the side of the bed. He attacks Rick, claiming that he is not familiar with anyone anymore. He stabs Rick in the upper-left chest. Rick knocks the weapon away, pointing his revolver at Morgan's head, and Morgan begs Rick to kill him. Morgan is tied up again and, after patching himself up, Rick finally manages to make him remember that the two know each other. Morgan says that he tried to contact Rick every morning for several weeks, but he never answered the radio, before explaining what happened to Duane. He is offered the chance to join the group at the prison, but he realizes that Rick is taking a lot of guns, meaning that they are preparing for a war. Morgan claims that Rick, Carl, and his people will die either by bullets or by walkers, and refuses to join them, not wanting to see anyone else die. While clearing out the walkers caught on his traps, Carl approaches Morgan and tells him that he is sorry for shooting him earlier. Morgan remarks to Carl, \\"Don't ever be sorry.\\" While leaving King County, Rick, Carl, and Michonne watch as Morgan prepares to burn the corpses of the walkers he captured.\\r\\nAfter the credits in the episode \\"No Sanctuary\\", a masked man is seen approaching a Terminus sign Rick had written \\"No Sanctuary\\" on. He turns around and pulls off his mask, revealing himself to be Morgan who finds a cross mark on a tree and begins following a trail of them. Morgan reappears after the credits in the episode \\"Coda\\" where he follows the tree markings left by Gareth to the elementary school where he and the Hunters had cannibalized Bob Stookey's leg. Morgan puts down a walker pinned under debris and comes across Fr. Gabriel Stokes's church, where he puts together a makeshift shrine and kneels in front of it, praying for a short time before laughing. Morgan finds the map with a route to Washington D.C. lying on the ground (the one that Abraham Ford had previously given to Rick in the episode \\"Four Walls and a Roof\\") and reads the message Abraham had left on it for Rick. Morgan realizes that his friend is still alive somewhere.\\r\\nIn the season finale \\"Conquer\\", Morgan is now in Virginia and sleeping inside of a car, before starting a fire. A man approaches him at gunpoint, revealing himself to be a member of the Wolves, and after a brief conversation, demands that Morgan surrender all of his supplies as well as himself. As another Wolves member lunges at Morgan from behind with a knife, Morgan dodges the attack and fights the men with a wooden staff, overpowering them and knocking them unconscious. Morgan places them in the backseat of the car and blows the hornchecking if any walkers are nearbybefore departing. When Daryl Dixon and Aaron become trapped in a van surrounded by walkers when they set off a trap laid by the Wolves, Morgan rescues them and Aaron offers him the chance to come to Alexandria as a thank you for saving them. Morgan initially turns down the offer, but says he is lost but on his way to somewhere, and shows Daryl the map to Washington D.C. with Rick's name on it that he had found at the church. Realizing that Morgan knows Rick, Daryl and Aaron bring him to Alexandria, where they arrive in time to witness Rick executing Pete Anderson under orders from Deanna Monroe following Pete's murder of Deanna's husband.\\r\\nIn the season premiere, \\"First Time Again\\", Morgan and Rick catch up, revealing that he learned how to use his staff from someone after the outbreak. Morgan is kept in a room for the night before Rick lets him free, telling him he doesn't take chances anymore. Morgan accompanies Rick in going out of the Safe Zone to bury Pete, when they come across a rock quarry filled with walkers. Morgan helps Rick with his plan to lure the walkers out of the quarry and away from the Safe Zone, knowing it's only a matter of time before they break free. Morgan is present when they walk in on Carter (Ethan Embry) discussing his plans to kill Rick and take the Safe Zone back, holding a gun to Eugene. Rick disarms Carter, which leads him into telling Morgan that no matter what happens, people like Carter will end up dying. During construction on a makeshift barrier, several walkers stumble into the work zone. Rick wants the Alexandrians to kill them, but Morgan intervenes, saying he doesn't take chances anymore either. As the group are luring the walkers out of the quarry and away from the Safe Zone, a blaring horn is heard coming from Alexandria. This causes the herd of walkers to begin making their way through the woods and back to the Safe Zone, with Morgan, Rick and Michonne running back to Alexandria.\\r\\nIn the episode \\"JSS\\", Morgan arrives back at Alexandria after a big rig truck crashed into a tower. He finds out that Alexandria was breached by a group known as the Wolves who are brutally slaughtering everyone they can in Alexandria with an arsenal of blades. The Reverend Gabriel being attacked by a Wolf but is saved by Morgan. When asked by Gabriel how he learned to fight like that Morgan responded, \\"from a cheese maker.\\" Morgan ran around Alexandria to fight off other wolves and found himself surrounded by five of them. The leader of the pack recognized Morgan from their previous encounter. Morgan asked the Wolves to leave, but instead the Wolves attacked him. One by one the Wolves were knocked down by Morgan using only his staff in hand. He informs the Wolf that his people have guns and they would be shot if they didn't leave. The Wolves finally comply as they realize they can't win. Once the Wolves left Alexandria, Morgan surveys the carnage left behind by the attackers. He went inside a house the Wolves ravaged and was ambushed by who appears to be the leader of the Wolves. A fight ensued between them in the living room, and eventually Morgan was able gain an upper hand to subdue the Wolf leader and knocked him unconscious.\\r\\nThe episode \\"Here's Not Here\\" reveals how Morgan regained his sanity and learned his martial arts skills from a survivor named Eastman. After Rick left Morgan in King County, it's revealed that Morgan began attacking and killing anyone he came across. When he comes across Eastman, he was knocked unconscious and locked inside a cell in the cabin. While Morgan initially rebuffs Eastman's attempts to get to know him and help him move past his trauma (constantly telling him, he's going to kill Eastman when he gets out), Morgan eventually calms down and listens to Eastman's philosophy. From then on, Eastman taught Morgan how all life is precious as well as teaching him Aikido to allow him to defend himself without resorting to lethal force. The episode shows how Eastman died from a walker bite, but Morgan carries his peaceful ways on with a promise to never kill again. The episode ends with Morgan shown to have been telling the story to the Wolf leader (locked in his basement) in an attempt to convert him in turn.\\r\\nIn the episode \\"Heads Up\\", Morgan admits to Rick and Michonne that he let the Wolves escape, believing that people can change, though Rick doubts his ability to survive without getting his hands dirty. Morgan later visits Denise Cloyd and gains her help in treating the Wolf he captured. In the mid-season finale \\"Start to Finish\\", when Alexandria's walls are breached by a horde of walkers, Carol and Morgan take shelter in Morgan's house. She finds the captive Wolf, and threatens him with a knife, but Morgan intervenes and they fight, allowing the Wolf to escape.\\r\\nIn the mid-season premiere \\"No Way Out\\", the escaped Wolf is killed while saving Denise from walkers. When the Wolf reanimates, Morgan kills it and apologizes. In the episode \\"Not Tomorrow Yet\\", Morgan tries to talk the group out of attacking the Saviors, but Rick is determined to kill them all. With the strike force gone on their sneak attack, Morgan is seen back in Alexandria welding bars together to make a new detention cell. In the episode \\"Twice as Far\\", Morgan is seen reinforcing his jail cell, telling Rick it will give them options in the future. In the episode \\"East\\", after Carol goes missing, both Morgan and Rick set out to find her. They find an unknown man, whom Rick decides to shoot after the man asks for his horse, but Morgan stops him. The man is already gone by the time Morgan explains to Rick how everything is a cycle and by sparing the Wolf leader he kept in Alexandria, Denise was saved and was able to save Carl. The two then part ways with Rick giving Morgan a gun and telling him to come back once he finds Carol. In the season finale \\"Last Day on Earth\\", Morgan continues to search for Carol. He finds the missing man's horse and is pleased to see he was telling the truth. Soon, he finds Carol, who has been shot twice by one of the Saviors. When the man moves to shoot Carol, Morgan kills him by repeatedly shooting him and then moves to help Carol when the man he and Rick encountered before returns with a friend. Morgan returns his horse and the men agree to help get Carol to safety.\\r\\nMorgan first appears in the second episode of the season, \\"The Well\\" where it's revealed that the men he encountered at the end of last season brought him and Carol to a community known as The Kingdom. After Carol wakes up from a long sleep, Morgan introduces her to the leader of the community, King Ezekiel and his pet Bengal tiger Shiva. While Carol dismisses Ezekiel's masquerade as a true medieval king as ridiculous, Morgan seems more open-minded. He begins to become more involved in the community, helping feed their pigs and dispatch walkers. Ezekiel, impressed by Morgan's skills with the staff, asks him to train Ben, a young survivor who is very important to him. Morgan is reluctant at first as he reasons the stick couldn't have saved Carol, but he eventually agrees. While training Ben, Morgan borrows him The Art of Peace book given to him by Eastman and states that he is struggling with his beliefs as he was forced to kill again to save Carol, but still continues to value life. Morgan is later present when Ezekiel and other members of the Kingdom give tribute to the Saviors with Ezekiel expressing his desire to fight and defeat the Saviors. The episode ends with Morgan escorting Carol to an abandoned house outside the Kingdom where they part on amicable terms before Morgan heads back. Morgan reappears in the mid-season finale \\"Hearts Still Beating\\", where Carol sees him leaving fruit by her door. She calls him inside and shows him Ezekiel has already brought plenty of fruit, before asking him how he is. When he responds that he's good, she then tells him to leave. The two are then approached by Ezekiel's adviser Richard, who asks for their help in convincing Ezekiel to launch a preemptive strike against the Saviors. Morgan refuses as he doesn't want to be the one to break the peace. When Carol reiterates that she just wants to be left alone, Morgan replies that she was never supposed to see him before leaving. In \\"Rock in the Road\\", Morgan is reunited with Rick and the others when they are brought to the Kingdom by Jesus. He tells them that he found Carol, but she left a short time after being in the Kingdom. He later sits in on Rick's meeting with Ezekiel, where he asks the Kingdom to join their fight against the Saviors. Ezekiel asks Morgan for his opinion and Morgan admits that he believes war isn't the answer and suggests they find another way. This sways Ezekiel to turn down Rick and the group leave the Kingdom soon after (though Daryl stays behind in order to better hide from the Saviors). In \\"New Best Friends\\", Morgan is present at the next tribute to the Saviors when tensions escalate between Richard and Jared. When guns are drawn, Morgan and Ben use their staffs to stop Jared who then takes Morgan's staff. Despite this, he continues to disagree with Daryl who advocates war. Morgan's moral conundrums come to a head in \\"Bury Me Here\\", when during a tribute, the Kingdom comes up short. To make an example of the Kingdom, Jared shoots Benjamin. They rush him to Carol's but Ben succumbs to his injuries and dies. Benjamin's death causes Morgan to become distraught and begin to lose his grip on reality (with flashbacks of King County flashing through his mind). When he realizes Richard engineered the situation, he confronts him. Richard claims it was supposed to be him, but that they can use Ben's death to rally the Kingdom. The next day, while compensating the Saviors, Morgan snaps and attacks Richard, stunning him with his staff before strangling him to death (shocking both sides). Morgan explains that Richard was behind Ben's death and is able to placate the Saviors. He then goes to see Carol and reveals what happened as well as telling her the truth about everyone the Saviors as killed. He claims he's going to kill them all, one by one, but Carol convinces him to stay. The episode ends with Morgan sharpening his staff into a spear, symbolizing his abandonment of Eastmen's ideals in favor of violence. In \\"The First Day of the Rest of Your Life\\", Morgan is found by Ezekiel, Carol and a group of Kindgdom survivors en route to Alexandria, donning Benjamin's armor and wielding his spear. Ezekiel asks him if he is determined to erase who he was with Morgan claiming he doesn't wish it, but is \\"stuck\\" (implying his inability to live in their world with both his life and values). Ezekiel convinces him to march with them to Alexandria. When they arrive, they join the Alexandrians in battle against the invading Saviors. During the battle, Morgan kills several Saviors (saving Rick at one point), making liberal use of both firearms as well as his spear. He is later seen sitting in silence, after the battle, where he is comforted by Carol (as both have been forced into killing again).\\r\\nMorgan appears in the season premiere \\"Mercy\\" where he is part of Tara and Jesus's group of soldiers, assigned to attack several Savior compounds. \\"The Damned\\" shows the attack commencing with Morgan leading the attack, assuaging doubts by claiming \\"I don't die\\", a reference to his loved ones constantly dying while he survives. Morgan is shown to kill numerous Savior during the attack before encountering Jared, Benjamin's killer, again. He is about to kill him when Jesus stops him, stating they've surrendered. \\"Monsters\\" shows Morgan's group leading the captured Saviors back to Hilltop as prisoners. Jared continues to bait Morgan, but he refrains from taking action. When the prisoners attempt an escape, Morgan kills one of them, but is stopped by Jesus from killing the others. Their disagreement over killing leads Morgan to attack Jesus, leading to a heated fight. Despite seemingly being evenly matched, Jesus manages to disarm Morgan before returning his staff. Morgan claims \\"I know I'm not right. But that doesn't make me wrong\\" before leaving the group.\\r\\nLennie James played Morgan in the series premiere \\"Days Gone Bye\\".[15] Mike Ryan of Vanity Fair described Morgan in his review of the episode as \\"scared shitless of zombies breaking in, which seems like a reasonable reaction\\".[16] Liz Kelly and Jen Chaney of The Washington Post commented on Morgan and Duane, \\"whose loss of the mother figure in their family reminded us a little of \\"Lost's\\" Michael and Walt\\".[17] Josh Jackson of Paste described Morgan and Duane as being \\"tormented by Morgan's wife walking the streets outside the suburban home where they're squatting. Unable to put her out of her misery or move on without her, they're frozen in place, tormented by loss that hasn't really gone away. It's the most nightmarish of scenarios ÿ hunted by the shell of a loved one ÿ the zombies aren't generic; this one is personal.\\"[18] Jackson also stated that Rick is \\"shell-shocked by the world he wakes up to and Morgan serves as his shepherd into reality\\".[18] Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club described Morgan as \\"beautifully played by the always welcome Lennie James\\" and adding that he \\"adds a moment of poignancy, as he finds himself actually apologizing for having not killed his now-reanimated wife\\".[19] Pierce describes the scene in which Morgan \\"tries to gather thestrength? resolve? compassion?to destroy what used to be his wife\\" as a \\"wrenching\\" scene.[19] Kris King of Starpulse noted that Morgan \\"has a powerful scene involving the fate of his wife and his grizzly attempt to come to terms with his loss\\".[20] Writing for The Atlantic, Scott Meslow describes what he considers \\"the episode's most devastating scene\\", in which \\"Morgan aims at [his wife's] head through a rifle from a window, almost pulling the trigger several times before collapsing in tears. Morgan's fate is a dark reflection of Rick's worst fears; with his wife and son missing, and with no way to contact them, Rick never knows if he'll turn a corner and find a grotesque perversion of the wife and son he loves.\\"[21]\\r\\nIt was confirmed on November 19, 2012, that Morgan would be returning in Season 3.[22] In an interview with Inside TV, Robert Kirkman defines the title of the episode \\"Clear\\", and how it relates to Morgan: \\"It means a lot of things. To a certain extent it's the ravings of a lunatic but it's also about him trying to clear out his life and clear out any entanglements around him. He's living by himself so he's trying to have a clear head. It's basically about him getting rid of his wife and getting rid of his son and the only way for him to survive is to clear the area around him.\\"[23] Kirkman also felt that Lennie James was \\"really playing a completely different character and doing completely different things in this episode and is just as amazing doing it. So it was a lot of fun having him back and also having him do things that were so different from what he had done before.\\"[23] In his recap of the episode for the Los Angeles Times, Todd VanDerWerff called Lennie James a \\"brilliant actor\\", and felt that \\"his role is significant enough that he essentially becomes the main supporting player in the piece\\".[24] Eric Kain of Forbes called the performance of Lennie James \\"absolutely riveting\\", noting that Morgan \\"is a changed man, and not for the better\\"; Kain called Morgan's refusal of Rick's offer to return to the prison with him \\"a glorious scene\\".[25] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club describes Morgan's situation: \\"Morgan's crime is that he couldn't let go of the past; he couldn't shoot his dead wife, and so his dead wife eventually killed his son. So now he has nothing to live for, but he doesn't have the strength of will left to take his own life. Which leaves him trapped. He can't join up with Rick's group, no matter how much Rick wants him to, because that would mean connecting with people again, becoming vulnerable, risking himself and having to suffer when his new friends die. And he can't commit suicide, because that would require a different kind of courage. So he's stuck building his traps, covering the walls with his writing, sending messages to strangers he'll never see.\\"[26]\\r\\nOn November 26, 2017, it was announced on Talking Dead that Lennie James would be exiting The Walking Dead and transitioning the role of Morgan to Fear the Walking Dead.[27]","input":"What episode did morgan first appear on the walking dead?"},{"output":"Fatima bint Muhammad Al-Fihriya Al-Qurashiya","context":"Fatima bint Muhammad Al-Fihriya Al-Qurashiya (Arabic: ????? ??? ???? ??????? ????????) was an Arab Muslim woman who is credited for founding the oldest existing, continually operating and first degree-awarding educational institution in the world, The University of Al Quaraouiyine in Fes, Morocco in 859 CE.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAl-Fihri was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and had been educated.[2] The family was part of a large migration to Fes from the town of Kairouan (Qayrawan), in modern Tunisia, which lent its name to the mosque and madrassa she would found.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe madrasa Al-Fihri founded is still in operation today as the University of Al Quaraouiyine.

Dave Grohl wrote and recorded the entire album himself, apart from a guest guitar spot by Greg Dulli, with the assistance of producer Barrett Jones at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, Washington, in 1994. He claimed that he recorded the album just for fun, describing it as a cathartic experience to recover from the death of Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Grohl completed the recordings, he chose the name \\"Foo Fighters\\" for the project to hide his identity, and passed cassettes copies of the sessions to personal friends. When the tapes attracted record label interest, Grohl signed with Capitol and recruited a full band to perform the songs live. The album was promoted through extensive tours and six singles, two of which received music videos.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon its release, Foo Fighters earned positive reviews, praising its songwriting and performances, and was also a commercial success, becoming the band's second-best-selling album in the United States. It also peaked within the top five of charts of United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the death of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain in April 1994, drummer Dave Grohl entered a state of depression,[3] and found it difficult to both listen to music and play instruments.[4] He was uncertain of what to do next, even considering abandoning his musical career despite a few invitations by bands such as Danzig or Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to become their drummer, because \\"it would just remind me of being in Nirvana; every time I sat down at a drum set, I would think of that.\\"[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrohl's first musical performance following the demise of Nirvana was performing with The Backbeat Band at the 1994 MTV Movie Awards in June, during which he was invited by Mike Watt to take part in his album Ball-Hog or Tugboat?. After enjoying the performance, Grohl figured he could do his own musical project,[7] which could work as \\"some sort of cathartic therapy, to go out and record these songs that I'd written by myself.\\"[6] Grohl afterwards booked six days at Seattle's Robert Lang Studios, which were located near his house, where he would record \\"my favorite songs I had written in the past four, five years that no one had heard\\"[3] with the assistance of producer Barrett Jones, with whom he had recorded the demo tape Pocketwatch in 1992.[8] The idea was to have Grohl playing all instruments and release it under a name that would make people believe it was a band, similar to Stewart Copeland's Klark Kent.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n?Dave Grohl in 2011[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrohl and Jones produced the record across a period of one week in October 1994, with Grohl on vocals and all instruments. Both would arrive in the morning at Robert Lang Studios, start production by noon and do four songs a day.[6] According to Grohl, during the recording process he would run from room to room, \\"still sweating and shaking from playing drums and [then] pick up the guitar and put down a track, do the bass, maybe another guitar part, have a sip of coffee and then go in and do the next song\\". The only performance by an outsider was a guitar part on \\"X-Static\\" provided by Greg Dulli of The Afghan Whigs, who was watching Grohl record the songs. Grohl eventually asked him if he wanted to play and handed him a guitar.[10] Each song took about 45 minutes to be completed, and the compositions were recorded in the same order that became the album's track listing. The only song that required two run-throughs before completion was \\"I'll Stick Around\\".[8] Grohl was insecure about his singing, and added effects to his voice in \\"Floaty\\",[11] and tried to enhance the performance through double track ÿ \\"You know how people double their vocals to make them stronger? That album the vocals are quadrupled.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an attempt to keep his anonymity, Grohl planned to release the songs under the name Foo Fighters.[7] It would be a very low-key release, with only 100 LP records being pressed after the sessions were finished.[8] Grohl also went to a cassette duplication lab in Seattle and created 100 cassette copies of the session and started handing them to friends for feedback and \\"I'd give tapes to everybody. Kids would come up to me and say 'Nirvana was my favourite band' and I'd say 'well here, have this'\\".[12] Eddie Vedder premiered two songs from the recording on January 8, 1995 during his Self-Pollution radio broadcast.[7] The recordings quickly circulated amongst the music industry, which in turn created record label interest. A deal was eventually signed to Capitol Records, as president Gary Gersh was a personal friend of Grohl ever since he worked on Nirvana's label Geffen Records.[5][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mixing sessions of the album began in Robert Lang Studios (which were used on the 100 tapes Grohl gave away) but eventually those mixes were discarded and the sessions moved to Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock's \\"The Shop\\" studio in Arcata, California. Mixes were done on a 32 channel API DeMedio console, custom built by Frank DeMedio in 1972 for Wally Heider Recording's 'Studio 4'. A Stephen's 24 track 2\\" tape machine was used for playback. Processors used in the mixes included an Eventide Omnipressor compressor for vocals and guitar solos, an Alan Smart stereo compressor for \\"squashing\\" the drums and mixing them back in as well as being used over the entire mix. Other processors included UREI 1176 and LA3A compressors as well as an Echoplex for delays and a \\"crappy digital reverb\\". Mixes were \\"nothing that crazy\\" Rob described, adding that he \\"mixed 'Big Me' in 20 minutes\\".[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the sessions, Grohl was invited by Tom Petty to perform with The Heartbreakers on Saturday Night Live one month later. The performance was followed by an invitation to be a full-time member of the Heartbreakers, but once Petty heard about the Foo Fighters, he instead encouraged Grohl to move on with this solo project.[15] Grohl soon recruited a full band, which included bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith of the recently disbanded Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as Nirvana touring guitarist, and former Germs member, Pat Smear.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nNine of the songs in the album were composed before or during Grohl's tenure with Nirvana, and existed in demos created by Grohl on his home 8-track tape recorder.[15] The only compositions done after Cobain's death were \\"This Is a Call\\", \\"I'll Stick Around\\", \\"X-Static\\" and \\"Wattershed\\".[5][16] The music mostly followed a hard rock sound with the soft-loud dynamics seen in Nirvana tracks such as \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\".[8] Variants include the melancholic \\"Exhausted\\", which Grohl defined as a song that's \\"sad but makes you feel good\\".[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the lyrics in Foo Fighters are nonsensical lines written by Grohl in the 20 minutes before recording began.[17] As the frontman, Grohl explained, \\"I had seven days to record fifteen songs. I was just concentrating on everything being as together as possible, having everything be tight and in sync. There wasn't too much time spent sitting in a chair thinking.\\"[5][16] Grohl would add that the gibberish was deliberate, given that, \\"there was too much to say,\\" following Cobain's death and, \\"a lot of emphasis placed on the meaning of the first Foo Fighters album.\\"[15] Grohl still considered that \\"the things you write down spur of the moment are most revealing. Now I look at them and some of them seem to actually have meaning\\",[5][16] and revealed that a few songs have lyrics inspired by \\"personal experiences of the last four or five years\\", with the standout being \\"Big Me\\", an \\"out-and-out love song\\" to Grohl's then-wife Jennifer Youngblood that he described as his favorite track on the album.[11] Contrasting with the aggressive and rebellious themes of Nirvana, Grohl had positive and cheery tunes such as \\"This Is a Call\\", defined as \\"a 'hello' and a 'thank you'\\" to everyone that had played a key role in Grohl's life;[8] the playful \\"For All the Cows\\"; and \\"Wattershed\\", with a title referencing Mike Watt and lyrics that described Grohl's \\"love of hardcore and old school punk rock\\".[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"Foo Fighters\\" was taken from the description World War II aircraft pilots would use to describe various UFOs.[5] This science fiction theme is further continued with the name of Grohl's Capitol Records imprint, Roswell Records, a reference to the city of Roswell, New Mexico, known for the Roswell UFO incident of 1947; and the album cover done by Grohl's then-wife, photographer Jennifer Youngblood, featuring a Buck Rogers XZ-38 Disintegrator Pistol.[18] Some reviewers considered the gun on the cover as insensitive,[19] given Kurt Cobain died by shooting himself, but Grohl dutifully disregarded it as just a coincidence.[5][16]  Goldsmith later explained, \\"It was all pretty much based on the whole Foo Fighters thingRoswell, the space stuff, an antique Buck Rogers raygun. It's really a completely separate thing. Dave wasn't even conscious of that.\\"[5][16] Despite Grohl being the album's only contributor, at Capitol's insistence the liner notes included a picture of the full band that Grohl had recruited.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spring 1995, the Foo Fighters embarked on their first ever United States tour supporting Mike Watt along with fellow tour newbies Hovercraft, whose line-up included Vedder at the time. As well as performing with their own bands, Grohl and Vedder each picked up a role as a member of Watt's backing band throughout the tour, supplying drums and guitar respectively. On May 1995, radio stations KROQ-FM and KNDD started playing some tracks of the then-unreleased album before receiving a cease-and-desist from Capitol. That June, \\"Exhausted\\" and \\"This Is a Call\\" were sent to college and modern rock radio stations.[13] One week later, \\"This Is a Call\\" became the band's first commercial single.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nFoo Fighters was released July 4, 1995 on Roswell Records, distributed by Capitol Records. The band promoted the release that summer by completing another US tour with Wool and Shudder to Think, with 25 concerts in little over a month. The Foo Fighters also made their network television debut on the Late Show with David Letterman in August 14, where they performed \\"This Is a Call\\". Afterwards, the band played several of their largest shows up to that point, making their debut on the European festival circuit with performances at Pukkelpop, Reading and Lowlands.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"I'll Stick Around\\" was issued as the second single on September 4, 1995 and would also mark Foo Fighters music video debut, directed by Gerald Casale. That fall, the band continued to tour extensively,[20] with a European tour with Built to Spill,[21] and visits to Japan, Australia and New Zealand.[20] The tour was wrapped with a performance at the Phoenix Festival on July 20, 1996. The Foo Fighters performed nearly 100 concerts throughout 1995, and over 70 dates the following year.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThree more songs of the album were issued as singles: \\"For All the Cows\\" in 1995,[22] and both \\"Big Me\\" and \\"Alone + Easy Target\\" in 1996.[23] \\"Big Me\\" was the first commercial single made available in the US, and the second song from the album to see release as a music video, a parody of the Mentos television commercials directed by Jesse Peretz.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nFoo Fighters earned mostly positive reviews upon release. Many critics compared the album to Grohl's previous band, Nirvana.[18] Reviewer David Browne of Entertainment Weekly considered that \\"[Grohl's] songs pack the riffy wallop of unpolished Nirvana demos, and his voice has Kurt Cobain's lunging, over-the-top passion.\\"[28] Writing for Spin, Terri Sutton stylistically compared the album to Nirvana's second album, Nevermind, saying that \\"the album's first half [...] owes much to Nevermind, and it's tempting to hear it in the way Nevermind taught us to hear.\\"[34] Paul Rees of Kerrang! admitted that \\"Foo Fighters cannot fail to evoke Kurt Cobain's memory, whether if through Grohl's ragged howl of a voice or the way a number of its songs go soft-soft-loud\\", but ultimately considered the record \\"more than strong enough to stand or fall in its own merits\\".[17] Billboard complimented the \\"inspired songwriting and passionate performances\\", adding the album could please grunge fans and \\"also remind fans of other rock and punk taste makers, from Green Day and The Offspring to Better than Ezra.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album received minor criticism for its lack of intensity, which many proposed was due to the fact that Grohl played all the instruments himself. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, \\"Since he recorded the album by himself, they aren't as powerful as most band's primal sonic workouts, but the results are damn impressive for a solo musician.\\"[25] Rolling Stone's Alex Foege described the record as a \\"remarkable yet coolly understated solo debut\\" and felt that \\"the album's only disappointment is that despite its home-studio feel, it ultimately reveals little about its creator.\\"[31] New York described both the overall melodies and Grohl's singing as derivative of the grunge sound, but praised the \\"tight Beatlesesque harmonies\\" and lyrics that \\"key into the more poetic moments of dudespeak.\\"[35] Robert Christgau wrote in The Village Voice that the band shows \\"spirit\\" but lacks an \\"identity\\" and cited the songs \\"Big Me\\" and \\"This Is a Call\\" as highlights.[36] He later rated the album a three-star honorable mention in his Consumer Guide book, indicating \\"an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure\\".[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 1996 Grammy Awards ceremony, but lost to MTV Unplugged in New York, an album by Grohl's former band Nirvana.[38] Kerrang! named Foo Fighters the best album of the year,[39] and  Rolling Stone put it second on their list, behind PJ Harvey's To Bring You My Love.[40] It also ranked sixth on the Village Voice's Pazz & Jop poll,[41] and 20th on Spin's list.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commercial performance of Foo Fighters was also successful. In the United States, it debuted at the Billboard 200 on number twenty-three, with first-week sales of 40,000 units.[43] The album debuted at number two in New Zealand's album chart,[44] three in the UK Albums Chart,[45] and fifth in Australia's ARIA Charts.[46] It also peaked at number five in the Canadian Albums Chart.[47]  By December, it had reached 900,000 units domestically and 2 million worldwide.[43] On September 27, 1995, the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),[48] being later certified Platinum on January 26, 1996.[48] By 2011, Foo Fighters had sold 1.468 million units in North America, being the second most successful release of the band behind follow-up The Colour and the Shape.[49] It was also certified Platinum in Canada,[50] and Gold in the United Kingdom.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll tracks written by Dave Grohl.\\r\\nAlbum Reissued in 2003 (CD) and 2011 (LP + MP3 Download) with normal track list.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoo Fighters\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional musicians\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone^shipments figures based on certification alone","input":"When was the first foo fighters album released?"},{"output":"Racine Belles","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) was a professional women's baseball league founded by Philip K. Wrigley which existed from 1943 to 1954.  The AAGPBL is the forerunner of women's professional league sports in the United States.  Over 600 women played in the league.[1] In 1948, league attendance peaked at over 900,000 spectators. The most successful team, the Rockford Peaches, won a league-best four championships.  The 1992 motion picture A League of Their Own is a mostly fictionalized account of the early days of the league and its stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith America's entry into World War II, several major league baseball executives started a new professional league with women players in order to maintain baseball in the public eye while the majority of able men were away. The founders included Philip K. Wrigley, Branch Rickey and Paul V. Harper. They feared that Major League Baseball might even temporarily cease due to the war because of the loss of talent,[2] as well as restrictions on team travel due to gasoline rationing.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe women's initial tryouts were held at Wrigley Field in Chicago.  Scouted from amateur softball games across the country, over 200 women were invited to try-out, and about 60 were selected for the league roster.  Like the male major-league, the 'girls' league was also informally segregated, thus no African Americans were recruited or hired.  Women were selected for their skilled play, but the player also needed to fit what was seen by marketers as a wholesome feminine ideal.[4]   The first league game was played on May 30, 1943.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe league went through three periods of ownership. It was owned by chewing gum mogul, Wrigley[1] from 1943 to 1945, wealthy publicist Arthur Meyerhoff from 1945 to 1951, and the teams were individually owned from 1951 to 1954. The teams generally played in Midwestern cities. The South Bend Blue Sox and the Rockford Peaches were the only two teams that stayed in their home cities for the full period of the AAGPBL's existence.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first season, the league played a game that was a hybrid of baseball and softball.  The ball was 12?inches in circumference, the size of a regulation softball (regulation baseballs are 9 to 9?1?4?inches).  The pitcher's mound was only forty feet from home plate, closer even than in regulation softball and much closer than the baseball distance of 60 feet, 6?inches.  Pitchers threw underhand windmill, like in softball, and the distance between bases was 65 feet, five feet longer than in softball but 25 feet shorter than in baseball.  Major similarities between the AAGPBL and baseball included nine player teams and the use of a pitcher's mound (softball pitchers throw from flat ground).  By 1948 the ball had shrunk to 10 3/8 inches, overhand pitching was allowed, and the mound was moved back to 50 feet.  Over the history of the league, the rules continued to gradually approach those of baseball.  By the final season in 1954, the ball was regulation baseball size, the mound was moved back to 60 feet, and the basepaths were extended to 85 feet (still five feet shorter than in regulation baseball).[7]  Teams were generally managed by men who knew competitive athletics and were former major league players, in part to demonstrate to fans that the league was serious.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSalaries were above average for women and ranged from $45ÿ$85 (or $636ÿ$1202 in 2017 dollars[8]) a week during the first years of play to about $125 (or $1179 in 2017 dollars[8]) per week in later years.  The women's league generally went along with the men's late spring to early autumn season.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe uniforms worn by the female ballplayers consisted of a belted, short-sleeved tunic dress with a slight flare of the skirt. Rules stated that skirts were to be worn no more than six inches above the knee, but the regulation was most often ignored in order to facilitate running and fielding. A circular team logo was sewn on the front of each dress, and baseball caps featured elastic bands in the back so that they were one-size-fits-all[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring spring training the girls were required to attend Helena Rubinstein's evening charm school classes.  The proper etiquette for every situation was taught, and every aspect of personal hygiene, mannerisms and dress code was presented to all the players. In an effort to make each player as physically attractive as possible, each received a beauty kit and instructions on how to use it.  As a part of the leagues 'Rules of Conduct', the 'girls' were not permitted to have short hair, smoke or drink in public places, and they were required to wear lipstick at all times.  Fines for not following the leagues rules of conduct were five dollars for the first offense, ten for the second, and suspension for the third.[11] In 1944, Josephine \\"JoJo\\" DAngelo was fired for cutting her hair short.[12]  The women's contracts were much stricter about behavior than in the men's league, and each team was also assigned its own chaperone by the league.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AAGPBL peaked in attendance during the 1948 season, when 10 teams attracted 910,000 paid fans.[11] The Rockford Peaches won the most league championships with four (1945, 1948, 1949, 1950). The Milwaukee/Grand Rapids Chicks were second with three (1944 in Milwaukee, 1947 and 1953 in Grand Rapids). The Racine Belles (1943 and 1946) and the South Bend Blue Sox (1951 and 1952) each won two, and the Kalamazoo Lassies won in the league's final season (1954).[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1992 film A League of Their Own, although fictionalized, covers the founding and play of this league. Geena Davis, Lori Petty, Rosie O'Donnell, Madonna, and Tom Hanks were the stars of the film, which was directed by Penny Marshall.  The league is the forerunner of later-day professional league sports played by women.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nLois Siegel documented the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in her film Baseball Girls, which was produced by the National Film Board of Canada. Olive Little threw the first no-hitter in team and league history.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral histories of the AAGPBL have been published in book form.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the AAGPBL was the first recorded professional women's baseball league, women had played baseball since the nineteenth century. The first known women's baseball team played at Vassar College in 1866,[16] while barnstorming Bloomer Girls teams[17] (sometimes including men[18])\\r\\n\\r\\nBaseball Hall of Fame members Max Carey[19] and Jimmie Foxx[20] managed teams in the AAGPBL.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe league went through a series of name changes during its history.  It was founded as the All-American Girls Softball League.,[1] but midway through its first season of 1943, the name was changed to the All-American Girls Baseball League (AAGBBL).[11]  After the 1943 season, the official League name was again changed, to the All-American Girls Professional Ball League (AAGPBL), reflecting that players were paid from the start and further separate it from existing amateur leagues.[2]  This name was used until the end of the 1945 season, when the league reverted to All-American Girls Baseball League (AAGBBL), which it would use through 1950.  When teams were sold to independent owners at the end of the 1950 season, the official League name was changed to the American Girls Baseball League (AGBL), although it continued to be popularly identified as the All-American League or the All-American Girls Baseball League (AAGBBL).  When the Players' Association organized in 1986, and gained recognition by the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988, the name All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) was chosen to represent the league, and that is the name commonly used to refer to it to this day.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe uniform was a one-piece short-skirted flared tunic with a team patch in the center of the chest.  The base uniform was designed by Wrigley Company art director Otis Shepard, who was also the longtime art director for the Chicago Cubs and spearheaded a series of innovative uniforms beginning in 1937.[21][22]  Shepard modeled the uniform after the figure skating, field hockey, and tennis outfits of the period.  The uniforms included satin shorts, knee-high baseball socks, and a baseball cap.[23] The team patches were modeled after each respective city's seal.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme song made famous in the 1992 film A League of Their Own was the official song of the All-American Girls Baseball League, co-written by Pepper Paire and Nalda Bird (although in the movie, the word \\"Irishmen\\" was changed to \\"Irish ones\\").[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nVictory Song\\r\\nBatter up! Hear that call!\\r\\nThe time has come for one and all\\r\\nTo play ball.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are the members of the All-American League\\r\\nWe come from cities near and far\\r\\nWeve got Canadians, Irishmen and Swedes,\\r\\nWere all for one, were one for all\\r\\nWere all Americans!!\\r\\n\\r\\nEach girl stands, her head so proudly high,\\r\\nHer motto Do or Die\\r\\nShes not the one to use or need an alibi.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur chaperones are not too soft,\\r\\nTheyre not too tough,\\r\\nOur managers are on the ball.\\r\\nWeve got a president who really knows his stuff,\\r\\nWere all for one, were one for all,\\r\\nWere All-Americans!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn their annual reunions since 1998, it is usual to hear the original AAGPBL players singing the song.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was unable to continue in 1955, its history and its significance was forgotten by Baseball Historians. Many people in the 1950s thought that women were not supposed to play baseball, so most female athletes competed on other fields of endeavor. Finally, in 1980, former pitcher June Peppas launched a newsletter project to get in touch with friends, teammates and opponents, that resulted in the leagues first reunion in Chicago, Illinois in 1982.  The Players Association was formed after a 1986 Reunion held in Fort Wayne as part of Run, Jane Run a local Women's Bureau event. Historian and Baseball card publisher Sharon Roepke (author of Diamond Gals) who was circulating a petition to get the Baseball Hall of Fame to recognize the All American Girls Baseball League asked the players at the Reunion to organize to help the effort.  A meeting was held at the South Bend home of Fran Janssen and the Player's Association was born.  June Peppas was nominated President.\\r\\n[27]","input":"Who won the first women's world series?"},{"output":"June 30, 1974","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSix Flags Great Adventure is an amusement park located in Jackson, New Jersey, owned by Six Flags Entertainment Corp. Situated between New York City and Philadelphia, the park complex also contains the Hurricane Harbor water park.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park opened in 1974 under restaurateur Warner LeRoy. Six Flags took over ownership of the park in 1977. Today, the park contains eleven themed areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 30, 2012, Six Flags combined its 160-acre (65?ha) Great Adventure Park with its 350-acre (140?ha) Wild Safari animal park to form the 510-acre (210?ha) Six Flags Great Adventure & Safari park, making it the second-largest theme park in the world, after Disney's Animal Kingdom.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1972, entrepreneurial businessman Warner LeRoy developed concept plans for the Great Adventure entertainment complex, proposing seven parks be built within the complex: An amusement park, a safari park, a show park, a floral park, a sports complex, a shopping district, and a campground with beach/waterpark and stables.[5] His proposal also included plans for hotels, which were connected to the parks and could be reached by boats, buses, a sky ride and/or a monorail. LeRoy wanted his parks to flow naturally through the forest and lakes, capitalizing on the back-to-nature movement of the era. He chose a property then owned by the Switlik family, in an area centrally located between the New York City and Philadelphia regions. The property on CR 537 had easy access to the newly constructed Interstate 195, which connected central New Jersey to the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) and would eventually (in 1981) connect to the Garden State Parkway.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeRoy collaborated with Hardwicke Industries, who previously built safari parks in Canada and Europe. Together, they set out to open the seven parks in stages over a 5-year period. After a 4,500 invitation-only guest opening on June 30, 1974, the Great Adventure entertainment complex opened to the general public on July 1, 1974, at a price tag of $10 million.[6][7] At the time of the opening, only the Enchanted Forest and Safari parks were operational, and despite plans for a seven-park complex, only those three (if you count Hurricane Harbor) parks were ever realized, with elements from five of the other planned parks being used to create the Enchanted Forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Enchanted Forest was designed and built to look as if it appeared through the eyes of a child. Almost everything was designed to be bigger-than-life. A Big Balloon was a tethered hot-air balloon that loomed over the park's entrance and was the biggest of its kind in the world. The Log Flume was the longest log ride constructed in the world at that time and it was accompanied by a giant \\"Conestoga Wagon\\", an over-sized log cabin restaurant called \\"Best of the  West\\" and a huge Western Fortress, in the park's Rootin' Tootin' Rip Roarin' section. The Giant Wheel (now Big Wheel), then the tallest Ferris wheel in the world, and the Freedom Fountain, then the largest spraying fountain in the world, were located on the opposite end of the park. One of the few smaller-than-real life attractions was an outdoor walk-through attraction called the Garden of Marvels. It used working G-scale (o-g scale) LGB trains and boats amongst models of American landmarks and 1/25-scale recreations of European castles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis miniature village was an idea taken from LeRoy's proposed Over the Rainbow floral park. A tree filled with snakes, a carousel, antique cars, koi pond, children's playground (called Kiddie Kingdom), petting zoo (named Happy Feeling) and a restaurant named Gingerbread Fancy (now Granny's Country Kitchen) were also borrowed from the floral park concept to create a section of The Enchanted Forest. This section created the park's main midway named Dream Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nShoppe Lane was named after a proposed \\"shopping extravaganza\\" park, which LeRoy had designed for the property. It lent its large open squares, huge fountain (Main Street Fountain), street performers (clowns and stilt walkers) and shops to the Enchanted Forest. Fairy Tales was the name of a shop that opened with the park in one of the park's over-sized bazaar tents. It sold stuffed animals and toys, including Superman. Other influences from LeRoy's proposal would surface in the years to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeptune's Kingdom was a concept for a lakeside, aquatic show park. From its design came Aqua Spectacle, the home for dolphin performances and high dive shows. Today, the stadium features dolphins but is now known as Fort Independence. Neptune's Kingdom was designed to run the length from Runaway Train to Northern Star Arena, but most of its influences appear in the park's Lakefront area.\\r\\n\\r\\nRootin' Tootin' Ready for shootin' opened with Runaway Mine Train on the grand opening on Independence Day. A small compact coaster named Big Fury opened later in the season. The Sky Ride connected two ends of the park with stations in Rootin' Tootin' Ready for shootin and Dream Street. The double sky ride ran originally at the 1964ÿ'65 New York World's Fair. The Great Train Ride was a small train ride that brought guests through a loop of the woods, rather than to a destination of another gate. A small handful of spin rides were located in the Strawberry Fair section and were as close to any thematic journey as the guests were going to take. The Fantasy Fling is older than the park and is the only survivor of these spin rides in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fun Fair area debuted in 1975 with several new spinning rides, a smaller Ferris wheel and a Schwarzkopf Jumbo Jet roller coaster. The coaster never opened and was removed at the end of the season. A second flume called the Moon Flume was built by Arrow Dynamics to ease crowds on the Log Flume. It was built on the opposite end of the park and the station turntable is used for the stage of the Wiggles show today. The Fortune Festival was a new game section that was located where the Boardwalk section exists today.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large portion of LeRoy's vision for the amusement park that never came to be was the inclusion of dark rides. Although \\"Man, Time and Space\\", \\"The Keystone Cops\\" and \\"(Alice) Down the Wishing Well\\" (among others) never came to be, the Haunted Castle Across the Moat, which was added a few years later, took its cue from the rooms and monsters of the \\"Hotel Transylvania\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1976, the park's entrance was moved to a new central location, the same entrance still in use today. It was designed with an outer mall called Liberty Court and its Federal style architecture was influenced by the celebration of the United States bicentennial. An inner mall called Avenue of States was adorned by fifty state flags in the central corridor. Six flags remain on Main Street today. The Enchanted Forest name on the park was changed to the complex's main name of Great Adventure. The Strawberry Fair and Fun Fair names were discontinued and the attractions in these areas became part of the newly named Enchanted Forest section. More spin rides, \\"yummy yummy\\" food, shows, games and the Safari became a part of \\"the greatest day of your life.\\" The park became a major attraction with dozens of rides, shows, and several steel roller coasters. The Big Balloon, Happy Kid Ride, The Gondola, Pretty Monster, and Super Cat were the first attractions to be removed from the park before a new owner would make big changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1977, construction began on a steel looping shuttle coaster called Lightnin' Loops (which was removed in 1992). Late that year, however, the park was purchased by Six Flags. This regional theme park company was owned then by Penn Central, which had large stakes in the Philadelphia and New York City regions. Six Flags added rides found in bigger theme parks such as the wooden coaster called Rolling Thunder in 1979, The Buccaneer (a swinging ship from Intamin), Roaring Rapids (now Congo Rapids, an Intamin River Rapids ride), Parachuter's Perch (now Parachute Training Center: Edwards AFB Jump Tower, an Intamin Parachute ride) and Freefall (later Stuntman's Freefall, an Intamin First Generation Freefall), all before the park's tenth anniversary.\\r\\n\\r\\n1980 saw very few changes. In 1981, the park added a water ride called Roaring Rapids (now called Congo River Rapids). In 1983, the park added a Freefall Ride and in 1984, the park added a roller coaster called the Sarajevo Bobsleds but closed and removed Lil' Thunder, a kiddie coaster, keeping the coaster count to four.\\r\\n\\r\\nEight teenagers, including four students and one graduate of Franklin K. Lane High School, lost their lives in a fire at the Haunted Castle on May 11, 1984,[8] sparking controversy over the safety of such attractions. After the incident, new fire safety laws were passed for amusement park fun houses and dark rides.\\r\\n\\r\\n1986 saw the addition of a second looping coaster and the park's fifth roller coaster, Ultra Twister, with spiral inline twists. The ride was built next to Rolling Thunder, partially taking away the area's western theme. Another water ride called Splashwater Falls (which became Movietown Water Effect in 1992 and has since been removed) was added in which riders rode in a large boat which was pulled up hill and then down a steep waterfall, soaking riders. The new addition was made since attendance at the park had lowered since the Haunted Castle fire, and the park realized new additions were needed to keep the park alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nAttendance dropped even further when an accident occurred on the Lightning Loops roller coaster. A teenage girl was thrown from the train because she was seated on the wrong side of the shoulder restraint. After the accident, new safety features were added not only to Great Adventure's roller coasters, but also to roller coasters around the world. Once again, Great Adventure set both a bad and later good example for the amusement park world. However, the accident was not good for the park's attendance. Attendance was so low, in fact, that in 1987 rumors began to spread that the park may close in a few years. At the end of that season, the park was slated to get a new multiple looping coaster but by the end of the year, it was decided that Six Flags Great America would get the coaster since Great Adventure was not seen as a good investment. At the end of the 1988, the park was about to lose its license to sell food, and attendance was so low park management realized a big new addition was necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1988, it was announced that the park would indeed get a new coaster. Sarajevo Bobsleds was removed to make room for the new coaster, The Great American Scream Machine, which opened in April 1989. This coaster had multiple loops and for a month was the tallest roller coaster in the world and brought the park back to five roller coasters. The Scream Machine was removed in 2010 to make room for the new Green Lantern stand-up coaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, as part of a ride rotation program, a stand up looping roller coaster called Shockwave was added to the park. Shockwave had previously operated at Six Flags Magic Mountain. However, Ultra Twister was removed at the end of 1989 and sent to Six Flags Astroworld for the 1991 season keeping the park's coaster count at five. In 1991, the park added a huge complex of \\"dry\\" waterslides. While guests got wet on them, they could ride these with regular clothes or swimsuits. These slides were themed after the rivers of the world. Roaring Rapids, as well as the second flume ride in the park, were incorporated into this complex. Roaring Rapids became Congo Rapids, and The Hydro Flume became Irrawaddy Riptide.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, Time Warner acquired a 19.5% stake in Six Flags, then by the end of 1991 acquired an additional 30.5% giving them 50% ownership of the corporation, with the remaining divided equally by silent partners, The Blackstone Group and Wertheim Schroder.[9] Time Warner used the opportunity to advertise and promote their movies through the Six Flags parks. Time Warner purchased the remaining 50% in 1993, then in 1995 sold 51% of the corporation to Boston Ventures. Time Warner, however continued to manage the parks through 1997.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992, the eastern area or Fun Fair area of the park was re-themed Action Town, and then Movietown in 1993. A Batman stunt show was added and the announcement that a new inverted looping roller coaster called Batman The Ride would be added. Lightning Loops opened for the first half of the season but was disassembled at the end of July to begin construction of Batman. That coaster was sold to Premier Parks, which at the time was a different company than Six Flags (but would eventually buy Six Flags). Premier Parks put one of the Lightning Loops tracks in Frontier City located in Oklahoma City and it still operates today. Premier Parks put the other Lightning Loops track in their park in Largo, Maryland (near Washington, DC), then called Adventure World. That track was renamed the Python, which would be removed in 1999. At the end of 1992 the roller coaster Shockwave was removed as part of the \\"Ride Rotation Program\\" of Six Flags. Shockwave would be sent to Six Flags Astroworld and would reopen there in 1994 as Batman The Escape. So by the end of 1992 the park was down to just three coasters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBatman, designed by Bolliger & Mabillard, opened in the spring of 1993 bringing the coaster count back up to four. In 1994, a motion simulator theatre ride was added. Initially, it was an airplane flying themed attraction but has since been changed to a Halloween theme in the fall over the years. A dinosaur theme and a three-dimensional dinosaur theme was also used for this attraction. For several years, it operated as SpongeBob the ride and then as Fly Me To The Moon. For the 2010 season, the attraction did not run and that building remained vacant for future use.\\r\\n\\r\\n1995 saw the addition of Viper, a steel spiral looping roller coaster similar to Ultra Twister and in Ultra Twister's old spot, bringing the coaster count to five again. 1996 saw the addition of an indoor themed junior roller coaster called Skull Mountain. In 1997, a multiple looping dual track shuttle coaster called Batman & Robin: The Chiller was built but only opened for a day and encountered more technical difficulties. This coaster ended up not opening again until the spring of 1998. This coaster ran rather rough and was referred to as a \\"headbanger\\" as was Viper, and to a lesser extent The Scream Machine. The Mine Train and Rolling Thunder were also rough rides by then. Also, many flat rides were removed over the years and the park was showing signs of wear and tear, as well as obsolete attractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nPremier Parks purchased Six Flags from Time Warner and Boston Ventures on April 1, 1998.[9] The following year, the new management team added a dozen flat rides to the park and declared a \\"war on lines\\". The Adventure River complex was retired but the flume ride and the Congo Rapids remained. A kiddie water play area also remained as part of a new kiddie ride area called Looney Tunes Seaport. A junior roller coaster called Blackbeard's Lost Treasure Train (now known as Harley Quinn Crazy Train) as well as a kiddie roller coaster called Road Runner Railway were also added, but the star attraction was a floorless steel multiple looping roller coaster called Medusa (now known as Bizarro).\\r\\n\\r\\nNo changes were made at the park in 2000, but across the property on a separate parking lot, a Waterpark named Hurricane Harbor was built and opened at the end of May. This was also separately gated and charges a separate admission from Great Adventure. The park consists of a dozen waterslides, a kiddie water play area, and a wavepool.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, the park added another state of the art roller coaster called Nitro. In 2002, Batman & Robin: The Chiller was renovated and new trains without over the shoulder harnesses were added making it a much smoother ride. In 2003, Superman: Ultimate Flight was added. Exact models of this are found at Six Flags Over Georgia and Six Flags Great America. In 2004, new harnesses were added to the Runaway Mine Train and the up-charge attraction erUPtion was added to the Boardwalk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, the park added the world's tallest coaster called Kingda Ka and also dismantled Viper. With the addition of Kingda Ka, the season pass holders entrance to the park was closed because Kingda Ka's footprint went right over it. A new children's play area called Balin's Jungleland was also added. In 2006, a wooden twister coaster called El Toro was added in the spot formerly occupied by Viper, along with a new themed area, and another kiddie ride area to replace Bugs Bunny Land which was retired at the end of 2004.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of 2005, a proxy battle resulted in two major stockholders assuming control of the Six Flags Board. The Premier Group was ousted in December and the new board appointed Mark Shapiro as CEO.[9] In 2007, the park added Wiggles World and removed Batman & Robin: The Chiller. The rolls were replaced with banked hills to enhance ride performance. However, the ride closed forever on June 28 due to technical problems with the ride. Disassembling occurred that September. In addition, the path leading to Chiller was blocked off and several rides including Freefall, Splashwater Falls/Movietown Water Effect, and a couple other flat rides were removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, in the area occupied by the Movietown Water Effect, a new junior indoor Wild Mouse rollercoaster was added called The Dark Knight. Motion Simulator Ride ended the SpongeBob theming in favor of Fly Me To The Moon. Also Glow in the Park Parade was added to the entertainment lineup.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedusa was refurbished over the off-season and returned in 2009 as \\"Bizarro\\", a new incarnation of the same ride. The whole coaster, station, and surrounding theme elements were all changed and repainted to go with the new theme of the ride. Bizarro comic strips were put up along the queue line, and special effects and audio were added to the actual ride. The refurbishment brought crowds back to a ride that was beginning to lose its original charm and popularity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme park's parent Six Flags emerged from a 2008ÿ2010 bankruptcy with Al Weber Jr. as an interim CEO and subsequently by Jim Reid-Anderson in August 2010.  The company parent also moved its corporate headquarters from New York City back to Texas where the company started.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 2010 season, the Motion Simulator ride Fly Me To The Moon did not reopen and was not replaced with anything and remained vacant. In April 2010, rumors also began that the Great American Scream Machine would be removed at the end of the season. By mid June, rumors were that the coaster would be removed on July 1. That date came and went but on July 5, 2010, via Facebook, Six Flags confirmed the rumored removal of the Great American Scream Machine on July 18, 2010. The ride closed on late on that date and was demolished immediately after to make room for \\"a major new attraction in 2011.\\"  On September 16, 2010, the park announced that the Green Lantern, a standup roller coaster formerly known as Chang at the recently closed Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom, would debut in the Boardwalk section for the 2011 season. Green Lantern's lift hill and first drop runs parallel to the lift hill of Superman Ultimate Flight, which involved the demolition of a rarely used section of the preferred parking area.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2010, Six Flags began the process of removing licensed theming from attractions. They terminated several licenses including their license with The Wiggles. Wiggles' World was renamed and rethemed to Safari Kids in time for the 2011 season. Also in 2011, eruption was removed. Construction for the new Funtime Slingshot replacing eruption started mid-June 2011 and was recently finished a few weeks after.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, Great Adventure introduced SkyScreamer, a 242-foot-tall (74?m) Funtime StarFlyer, that soars riders in a 98-foot (30?m) circle at speeds over 43 miles per hour (69?km/h), that opened in the spring of 2012, along with bumper cars, flying elephants, and a musical themed scrambler that opened in the newly transformed area Adventure Alley (formerly Fantasy Forest area around the Big Wheel). On February 13, 2012, Six Flags Hurricane Harbor in New Jersey announced a new major water attraction King Cobra, that is the first in the United States.[12][13] The ride Falls at Hurricane Harbor was proposed to get a transformation, giving it a trapdoor release in 2012,[14][15] but was later cancelled for the new attraction King Cobra.[13] Furthermore in 2012, Six Flags Great Adventure removed two of its four Johnny Rockets food stands, one located in Plaza Del Carnival and the other in the Boardwalk. Both were replaced with a new food stand named Totally Kickin' Chicken.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 30, 2012, Six Flags combined its 160-acre (65?ha) Great Adventure Park with its 350-acre (140?ha) Wild Safari animal park to form the 510-acre (210?ha) Six Flags Great Adventure & Safari park, the second-largest theme park in the world, after Disney's Animal Kingdom.[16][17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 29, 2013, Six Flags officially announced the addition of Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom for the 2014 season a drop tower to be built on the vertical supports of Kingda Ka, as well as the removal of Rolling Thunder on September 8.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 28, 2014, Six Flags officially announced the addition of a Giant Loop from Larson International for the 2015 season, dubbed as Looping Dragon in Plaza del Carnaval section of the park. The Giant Loop was later renamed on January 14, 2015 to El Diablo.[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2015, Six Flags Great Adventure announced its plans to clear more than 18,000 trees to build a 90-acre solar farm with 21.9 megawatts capable of meeting virtually all of the theme park's electrical needs.[22][23][24] On September 3, 2015, Six Flags Great Adventure announced they would open a 4th Dimension roller coaster in spring 2016, then dubbed \\"Total Mayhem\\".[25] On November 21, 2015, Holiday in the Park, a Christmas event with millions of glittering lights and a meet and greet with Santa Claus, began for the first time at the park. On January 27, 2016, the park announced that \\"Total Mayhem\\" will be renamed to \\"The Joker\\" and that Blackbeard's Lost Treasure Train would be renamed to Harley Quinn Crazy Train. On September 1, 2016, the park announced Justice League: Battle for Metropolis 4D, featuring the first ever virtual loop. The ride opened on June 17, 2017, and uses the exterior building from the Chiller as a set piece.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 31, 2017, Six Flags announced that the park's newest ride, called Cyborg Cyber Spin, would open in spring of 2018. The ride will whirl guests on three axes while lifting riders up to 70 feet in the air. It will be located in the park's Metropolis section.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous artists have performed concerts at the park, including The Ramones, The Beach Boys, Heart, Kansas, Cheap Trick, Joan Jett, and Alice Cooper.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 29, 2012, Great Adventure hosted the FestEvil, a festival hosting contemporary metal and hardcore acts; Falling In Reverse and We Came As Romans coheadlined. It was Great Adventure's first metal show. At the end of the show, Falling In Reverse frontman Ronnie Radke threw three microphone stands into the crowd, injuring two attendees.  Radke was arrested after the show, and a spokesperson for Great Adventure announced that the park would no longer host shows with metal bands.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nSafari is closed on September 30. The Safari undergoes major renovations and redesign during the winter to unite Six Flags Great Adventure as one property.\\r\\n\\r\\nMain Street serves as the entry gate for Six Flags Great Adventure. It was originally entitled Liberty Court, and was built when the entrance to the park was moved from near what is now the Boardwalk area to a more central location. Main Street is themed as an Early-American town, somewhere around the 18th century. Later additions to Main Street have formed it into more of a turn-of-the-century town. In the front is Freedom Fountain, a popular meeting place.\\r\\n\\r\\nFantasy Forest serves as the midway for the park, and was originally part of the entrance. Fantasy Forest is designed to make its visitors feel like children, and the section's bright colors and fanciful design give it a magical feel. The Yum Yum Cafe, (Previously \\"The Great Character Cafe), which is designed to look like a giant ice cream sundae, is in this area along with the colorful Carousel and Enchanted Teacups. Originally, this section was split into two sections; Dream Street, the east side featuring the Carousel, and Strawberry Fair, the west side featuring the Big Wheel and Fantasy Fling. During Time Warner's acquisition of the park, these two sections of the park were combined into one. In 2012, the east side stayed as Fantasy Forest and the west side was re-themed and transformed to Adventure Alley.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure Alley, made up of what used to be the right half of Fantasy Forest, opened in 2012 along with SkyScreamer, a FunTime StarFlyer. The area has a retro theme, and features several classic family rides. It was built in a formerly barren area in response to complaints about there being a lack of family rides in the park. SkyScreamer, Dj Vu (a Scrambler relocated from American Adventures in Georgia), and Air Jumbo (a Flying Elephants ride relocated from Balin's Jungleland in the Golden Kingdom) all opened in May, while Fender Benders, a bumper cars attraction, opened in early July.  The area was sponsored by the Broadway show Jersey Boys, and as such, features songs from the musical as its soundtrack.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure Seaport was introduced for the 2011 season.  It is made up of two children's areas - Looney Tunes Seaport, and Safari Kids, and a small section of the park formerly part of Movietown.  Note that attractions in Looney Tunes Seaport and Safari kids are not included in the attractions list below but rather have their own separate lists.\\r\\n\\r\\nSafari Kids was added in 2011. It was known as Wiggles World from 2007 to 2010. Most of the rides were re-themed from Looney Tunes Seaport, while the section itself replaced an aging part of Looney Tunes Seaport and the outdated Riptide flume ride. The area was renamed and rethemed Safari Kids for 2011 when the parks rights to use the Wiggles brand expired.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis children's section of the park, based on Looney Tunes characters, opened in 1999 with the War on Lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nAttractions:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis section makes up of what used to be the \\"Fun Fair\\" and \\"Action Town\\" sections of the park. It is themed as a Hollywood back lot, complete with Hollywood style buildings, and movie-themed ride, shops, stalls, and other attractions. Most of the attractions include DC Comics (Batman: The Ride, Justice League). Over the years, many of the movie props have been removed, and all the flat rides in this section of the park have been moved or dismantled, leaving the section with very few rides. The addition of The Dark Knight Coaster meant the removal of the Movietown Water Effect, a themed Splashdown ride. Batman and Robin: The Chiller and Stuntman's Freefall (an Intamin free-fall ride) had already been removed; so now the section is relatively empty. Nitro was included in Movietown until the 2011 season, when it became part of Adventure Seaport. In summer 2016, permits were released for a Justice League: Battle for Metropolis dark ride to be placed where Batman and Robin: The Chiller once stood. The area surrounding Justice League: Battle for Metropolis was rethemed to Metropolis, but is still treated as part of Movietown.\\r\\n\\r\\nLakefront, as its name suggests, is found right on the lake in the back of the property. The rides and structures in Lakefront all have a nautical theme. The section also includes a Panda Express eatery.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously known as \\"Best of the West\\" and \\"Rootin' Tootin' Rip Roarin'\\", the park's western-themed section is very picturesque. It is home to many of the park's most famous structures including the Fort, and the Best of the West restaurant, as well as some of the park's very popular rides. In 2009, Bizarro opened (formerly Medusa, opened in 1999) in this section, and though it is questionable how that relates to the Old West, Bizarro was given a backstory; relating to his takeover of the Medusa Mine. Frontier Adventures features Best of the West restaurant, one of the most popular eateries in the park. Frontier Adventures is now home to the Safari Off Road Adventure station. It stands on the former location of the Super Teepee and the Conestoga Wagon.\\r\\n\\r\\nBugs Bunny National Park opened in 2006 along with El Toro. It has a series of camp-themed rides, all in a rustic area on the lake. Attractions include Bugs Bunny Camp Carousel, Bugs Bunny National Water Park Tower, Bugs Bunny Ranger Pilots, Daffy Duck's Hot Air Balloons, Porky Pig Camp Wagons and Wile E. Coyote Canyon Blaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis area was originally part of Frontier Adventures, and was also called \\"Hernando's Hideaway\\" for the opening of Rolling Thunder. This section of the park has heavy Spanish influences, including music, lights, and various structures including the station for El Toro. The whole area is very festive and is filled with vibrant colors and stucco buildings and Spanish tile roofs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Golden Kingdom[30] opened in 2005 with Kingda Ka on what was Bugs Bunny Land, the park's old kiddie-section. This section of the park is themed with many bamboo plants, stone temples, and more. It is also home to three llamas, which are near the entrance to the area on Aldabra Island, formerly home to aldabra tortoises.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously Fortune Festival, the boardwalk section of Great Adventure has games commonly found on boardwalks, boardwalk restaurants, and many of the park's larger flat rides. This area of the park was also previously themed as Edwards Air Force Base, and many of the theme elements from then still exist now, including \\"latrines\\", and the parachute tower's name. The section also has a slight boardwalk-influence to its rides.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of Six Flags Great Adventure's most thrilling roller coasters have placed in Amusement Today's annual Golden Ticket Awards. Below is a table with coasters at Great Adventure and their highest ranking in the Golden Ticket Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, Six Flags Great Adventure, along with the Garden State Film Festival, was awarded the Tourism Achievement Award. Both were presented the award for their contributions to improving the economy of the bi-county area through the use of tourism.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Halloween season, Six Flags Great Adventure is redecorated with spider webs, smoke machines, and other Halloween related decorations. Actors dress up in scary costumes and walk around to frighten guests, as they once did at the Haunted Castle. Fright Fest typically begins at 6:00 PM, as the zombies parade to a stage to kick off \\"fright by night.\\" The park does not recommend the nighttime activities for children 13 or under. Fright Fest attracts some of the heaviest crowds of the season, and becomes more and more crowded as the date draws closer to Halloween.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most popular attractions at Fright Fest every year is the theatrical production of Dead Man's Party, a live dance show with popular music that draws hundreds of viewers for every showing and has attained an almost cult-like local following.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seasonal event includes upcharge walk-through haunted attractions. Recurring attractions include The Manor, Total Darkness, Voodoo Island, and Wasteland. Areas of the park that include free-roaming zombies are The Bloody Fountain (Main Street), Circus Psycho (Boardwalk), and Bone Butcher Terror-tory (Frontier Adventures).","input":"When did six flags great adventure first open?"},{"output":"England","context":"","input":"What country is manchester united soccer team from?"},{"output":"7.6 billion people","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn demographics, the world population is the total number of humans currently living, and was estimated to have reached 7.6 billion people as of May 2018.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nWorld population has experienced continuous growth since the end of the Great Famine of 1315ÿ17 and the Black Death in 1350, when it was near 370?million.[2] \\r\\nThe highest population growth rates ÿ global population increases above 1.8% per year ÿ occurred between 1955 and 1975, peaking to 2.06% between 1965 and 1970.[3] The growth rate has declined to 1.18% between 2010 and 2015 and is projected to decline further in the course of the 21st century.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal annual births were highest in the late 1980s at about 139?million,[4] and as of 2011 were expected to remain essentially constant at a level of 135?million,[5] while deaths numbered 56?million per year and were expected to increase to 80?million per year by 2040.[6] \\r\\nThe median age of the world's population was estimated to be 30.4 years in 2018.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nSix of the Earth's seven continents are permanently inhabited on a large scale. Asia is the most populous continent, with its 4.54 billion inhabitants accounting for 60% of the world population. The world's two most populated countries, China and India, together constitute about 36% of the world's population. Africa is the second most populated continent, with around 1.28 billion people, or 16% of the world's population. Europe's 742 million people make up 10% of the world's population as of 2018, while the Latin American and Caribbean regions are home to around 651 million (9%). Northern America, primarily consisting of the United States and Canada, has a population of around 363 million (5%), and Oceania, the least-populated region, has about 41 million inhabitants (0.5%).[9] Though it is not permanently inhabited by any fixed population, Antarctica has a small, fluctuating international population based mainly in polar science stations. This population tends to rise in the summer months and decrease significantly in winter, as visiting researchers return to their home countries.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimates of world population by their nature are an aspect of modernity, possible only since the Age of Discovery. Early estimates for the population of the world[12] date to the 17th century: William Petty in 1682 estimated world population at  320 million (modern estimates ranging close to twice this number); by the late 18th century, estimates ranged close to one billion (consistent with modern estimates).[13] More refined estimates, broken down by continents, were published in the first half of the 19th century, at 600 to 1000 million in the early 1800s and at 800 to 1000 million in the 1840s.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimates of the population of the world at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 BC have ranged between 1 million and 15 million.[15][16]  Even earlier, genetic evidence suggests humans may have gone through a population bottleneck of between 1,000 and 10,000 people about 70,000 BC, according to the Toba catastrophe theory. By contrast, it is estimated that around 50ÿ60 million people lived in the combined eastern and western Roman Empire in the 4th century AD.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plague of Justinian, which first emerged during the reign of the Roman emperor Justinian, caused Europe's population to drop by around 50% between the 6th and 8th centuries AD.[18] The population of Europe was more than 70 million in 1340.[19] The Black Death pandemic of the 14th century may have reduced the world's population from an estimated 450 million in 1340 to between 350 and 375 million in 1400;[20] it took 200 years for population figures to recover.[21] The population of China decreased from 123 million in 1200 to 65 million in 1393,[22] presumably due to a combination of Mongol invasions, famine, and plague.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in AD 2, the Han Dynasty of ancient China kept consistent family registers in order to properly assess the poll taxes and labor service duties of each household.[24] In that year, the population of Western Han was recorded as 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households, decreasing to 47,566,772 individuals in 9,348,227 households by AD 146, towards the End of the Han Dynasty.[24] At the founding of the Ming Dynasty in 1368, China's population was reported to be close to 60 million; toward the end of the dynasty in 1644, it may have approached 150 million.[25] England's population reached an estimated 5.6 million in 1650, up from an estimated 2.6 million in 1500.[26] New crops that were brought to Asia and Europe from the Americas by Portuguese and Spanish colonists in the 16th century are believed to have contributed to population growth.[27][28][29] Since their introduction to Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century,[30] maize and cassava have similarly replaced traditional African crops as the most important staple food crops grown on the continent.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pre-Columbian North American population probably numbered somewhere between 2 million and 18 million.[32] Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence.[33] According to the most extreme scholarly claims, as many as 90% of the Native American population of the New World died due to Old World diseases such as smallpox, measles and influenza.[34] Over the centuries, the Europeans had developed high degrees of immunity to these diseases, while the indigenous peoples had no such immunity.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the European Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically.[38] The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730ÿ1749 to 31.8% in 1810ÿ1829.[39][40] Between 1700 and 1900, Europes population increased from about 100 million to over 400 million.[41] Altogether, the areas populated by people of European descent comprised 36% of the world's population in 1900.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nPopulation growth in the West became more rapid after the introduction of vaccination and other improvements in medicine and sanitation.[43] Improved material conditions led to the population of Britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 19th century.[44] The population of the United Kingdom reached 60 million in 2006.[45] The United States saw its population grow from around 5.3 million in 1800 to 106 million in 1920, exceeding 307 million in 2010.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first half of the 20th century in Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union was marked by a succession of major wars, famines and other disasters which caused large-scale population losses (approximately 60 million excess deaths).[47][48] After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia's population declined significantly ÿ from 150 million in 1991 to 143 million in 2012[49] ÿ but by 2013 this decline appeared to have halted.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany countries in the developing world have experienced extremely rapid population growth since the early 20th century, due to economic development and improvements in public health. China's population rose from approximately 430 million in 1850 to 580 million in 1953,[51] and now stands at over 1.3 billion. The population of the Indian subcontinent, which was about 125 million in 1750, increased to 389 million in 1941;[52] today, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are collectively home to about 1.63 billion people.[53] Java had about 5 million inhabitants in 1815; its present-day successor, Indonesia, now has a population of over 140 million.[54] In just one hundred years, the population of Brazil decupled (x10), from about 17 million in 1900, or about 1% of the world population in that year, to about 176 million in 2000, or almost 3% of the global population in the very early 21st century. Mexico's population grew from 13.6 million in 1900 to about 112 million in 2010.[55][56] Between the 1920s and 2000s, Kenya's population grew from 2.9 million to 37 million.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is estimated that the world population reached one billion for the first time in 1804. It was another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927, but it took only 33 years to reach three billion in 1960.[58] Thereafter, the global population reached four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987, six billion in 1999 and, according to the United States Census Bureau, seven billion in March 2012.[59] The United Nations, however, estimated that the world population reached seven billion in October 2011.[60][61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to current projections, the global population will reach eight billion by 2024, and is likely to reach around nine billion by 2042. Alternative scenarios for 2050 range from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion.[63] Projected figures vary depending on underlying statistical assumptions and the variables used in projection calculations, especially the fertility variable. Long-range predictions to 2150 range from a population decline to 3.2 billion in the \\"low scenario\\", to \\"high scenarios\\" of 24.8 billion.[63] One extreme scenario predicted a massive increase to 256 billion by 2150, assuming the global fertility rate remained at its 1995 level of 3.04 children per woman; however, by 2010 the global fertility rate had declined to 2.52.[64][65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no estimation for the exact day or month the world's population surpassed one or two billion. The points at which it reached three and four billion were not officially noted, but the International Database of the United States Census Bureau placed them in July 1959 and April 1974 respectively. The United Nations did determine, and commemorate, the \\"Day of 5 Billion\\" on July 11, 1987, and the \\"Day of 6 Billion\\" on October 12, 1999. The Population Division of the United Nations declared the \\"Day of 7 Billion\\" to be October 31, 2011.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2012, the global sex ratio is approximately 1.01 males to 1 female. The greater number of men is possibly due to the significant sex imbalances evident in the Indian and Chinese populations.[68][69] Approximately 26.3% of the global population is aged under 15, while 65.9% is aged 15ÿ64 and 7.9% is aged 65 or over.[68] The median age of the world's population was estimated to be 29.7 years in 2014,[70] and is expected to rise to 37.9 years by 2050.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the global average life expectancy is 71.4 years as of 2015, with women living an average of 74 years and men approximately 69 years.[67] In 2010, the global fertility rate was estimated at 2.52 children per woman.[65] In June 2012, British researchers calculated the total weight of Earth's human population as approximately 287 million tonnes, with the average person weighing around 62 kilograms (137?lb).[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CIA estimated nominal 2013 gross world product at US$74.31 trillion, giving an annual global per capita figure of around US$10,500.[73] Around 1.29 billion people (18.4% of the world population) live in extreme poverty, subsisting on less than US$1.25 per day;[74] approximately 870 million people (12.25%) are undernourished.[75] 83% of the world's over-15s are considered literate.[68] In June 2014, there were around 3.03 billion global Internet users, constituting 42.3% of the world population.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Han Chinese are the world's largest single ethnic group, constituting over 19% of the global population in 2011.[77] The world's most-spoken first languages are Mandarin Chinese (spoken by 12.44% of the world's population), Spanish (4.85%), English (4.83%), Arabic (3.25%) and Hindustani (2.68%).[68] The world's largest religion is Christianity, whose adherents account for 31% of the global population; Islam is the second-largest religion, accounting for 24.1%, and Hinduism the third, accounting for 13.78%.[68] In 2005, around 16% of the global population were reported to be non-religious.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 4.37 billion people live in these ten countries, representing around 57% of the world's population as of July 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tables below list the world's most densely populated countries, both in absolute terms and in comparison to their total populations.\\r\\n\\r\\nPopulation size fluctuates at differing rates in differing regions. Nonetheless, population growth is the long-standing trend on all inhabited continents, as well as in most individual states. During the 20th century, the global population saw its greatest increase in known history, rising from about 1.6 billion in 1900 to over 6 billion in 2000. A number of factors contributed to this increase, including the lessening of the mortality rate in many countries by improved sanitation and medical advances, and a massive increase in agricultural productivity attributed to the Green Revolution.[90][91][92]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, the United Nations estimated that the world's population was growing at an annual rate of 1.14% (equivalent to around 75 million people),[93] down from a peak of 88 million per year in 1989. By 2000, there were approximately ten times as many people on Earth as there had been in 1700. Globally, the population growth rate has been steadily declining from its peak of 2.19% in 1963, but growth remains high in Latin America, the Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 2010s, Japan and some countries in Europe began to encounter negative population growth (i.e. a net decrease in population over time), due to sub-replacement fertility rates.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, the United Nations stated that the rate of population growth was visibly diminishing due to the ongoing global demographic transition. If this trend continues, the rate of growth may diminish to zero by 2050, concurrent with a world population plateau of 9.2 billion.[95] However, this is only one of many estimates published by the UN; in 2009, UN population projections for 2050 ranged between around 8 billion and 10.5 billion.[96] An alternative scenario is given by the statistician Jorgen Randers, who argues that traditional projections insufficiently take into account the downward impact of global urbanization on fertility. Randers' \\"most likely scenario\\" reveals a peak in the world population in the early 2040s at about 8.1 billion people, followed by decline.[97] Adrian Raftery, a University of Washington professor of statistics and of sociology, states that \\"theres a 70 percent probability the world population will not stabilize this century. Population, which had sort of fallen off the worlds agenda, remains a very important issue.\\"[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimated world population figures, 10,000?BCÿAD 2000\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimated world population figures, 10,000?BCÿAD 2000 (in log y scale)\\r\\n\\r\\nWorld population figures, 1950ÿ2000\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimated global growth rates, 1950ÿ2050\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimated and projected populations of the world and its continents (except Antarctica) from 1950 to 2100.

The United Nations and the US Census Bureau both give different estimates ÿ according to the UN, the world population reached seven billion in late 2011,[99] while the USCB asserted that this occurred in March 2012.[110] The UN has issued multiple projections of future world population, based on different assumptions. From 2000 to 2005, the UN consistently revised these projections downward, until the 2006 revision, issued on March 14, 2007, revised the 2050 mid-range estimate upwards by 273 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nAverage global birth rates are declining fast, but vary greatly between developed countries (where birth rates are often at or below replacement levels) and developing countries (where birth rates typically remain high). Different ethnicities also display varying birth rates. Death rates can change rapidly due to disease epidemics, wars and other mass catastrophes, or advances in medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\n2012 United projections show a continued increase in population in the near future with a steady decline in population growth rate; the global population is expected to reach between 8.3?and 10.9?billion by 2050.[111][112] 2003 UN Population Division population projections for the year 2150 range between 3.2 and 24.8 billion.[64] One of many independent mathematical models supports the lower estimate,[113] while a 2014 estimate forecasts between 9.3 and 12.6 billion in 2100, and continued growth thereafter.[114][115] Some analysts have questioned the sustainability of further world population growth, highlighting the growing pressures on the environment, global food supplies, and energy resources.[116][117][118]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1975, Sebastian von Hoerner proposed a formula for population growth which represented hyperbolic growth with an infinite population in 2025.[121] The hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s was later correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development. This feedback can be described as follows: technological advance L increase in the carrying capacity of land for people L demographic growth L more people L more potential inventors L acceleration of technological advance L accelerating growth of the carrying capacity L faster population growth L accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors L faster technological advance L hence, the faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on.[122] The transition from hyperbolic growth to slower rates of growth is related to the demographic transition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Russian demographer Sergey Kapitsa,[123] the world population grew between 67,000 BC and 1965 according to the following formula:\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to linear interpolation and extrapolation of UNDESA population estimates, the world population has doubled, or will double, in the years listed in the tables below (with two different starting points). During the 2nd millennium, each doubling took roughly half as long as the previous doubling, fitting the hyperbolic growth model mentioned above. However, after 2024, it is unlikely that there will be another doubling of the global population in the 21st century.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his 1798 work An Essay on the Principle of Population, the British scholar Thomas Malthus incorrectly predicted that continued population growth would exhaust the global food supply by the mid-19th century. Malthus wrote the essay to refute what he considered the unattainable utopian ideas of William Godwin and Marquis de Condorcet, as presented in Political Justice and The Future Progress of the Human Mind. In 1968, Paul R. Ehrlich reprised Malthus' argument in The Population Bomb, predicting that mass global famine would occur in the 1970s and 1980s.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe predictions of Ehrlich and other neo-Malthusians were vigorously challenged by a number of economists, notably Julian Lincoln Simon, and advances in agriculture, collectively known as the Green Revolution, forestalled any potential global famine in the late 20th century. Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the world, grain production increased by over 250%.[127] The world population has grown by over four billion since the beginning of the Green Revolution, but food production has so far kept pace with population growth. Most scholars believe that, without the Revolution, there would be greater levels of famine and malnutrition than the UN presently documents.[128] However, neo-Malthusians point out that fossil fuels provided the energy for the Green Revolution, in the form of natural gas-derived fertilizers, oil-derived pesticides, and hydrocarbon-fueled irrigation, and that many crops have become so genetically uniform that a crop failure in any one country could potentially have global repercussions.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, a meta-analysis of 70 quantitative studies estimating a sustainable limit to the world population generated a meta-estimate of 7.7 billion people.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2008, the price of grain was pushed up severely by the increased cultivation of biofuels, the increase of world oil prices to over $140 per barrel ($880/m3),[131] global population growth,[132] the effects of climate change,[133] the loss of agricultural land to residential and industrial development,[134][135] and growing consumer demand in the population centres of China and India.[136][137] Food riots subsequently occurred in some countries.[138][139] However, oil prices then fell sharply. Resource demands are expected to ease as population growth declines, but it is unclear whether mass food wastage and rising living standards in developing countries will once again create resource shortages.[140][141]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Pimentel, professor of ecology and agriculture at Cornell University, estimates that the sustainable agricultural carrying capacity for the United States is about 200 million people; its population as of 2015 is over 300 million.[142] In 2009, the UK government's chief scientific advisor, Professor John Beddington, warned that growing populations, falling energy reserves and food shortages would create a \\"perfect storm\\" of shortages of food, water, and energy by 2030.[125][143] According to a 2009 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the world will have to produce 70% more food by 2050 to feed a projected extra 2.3 billion people.[144]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe observed figures for 2007 showed an actual increase in absolute numbers of undernourished people in the world, with 923 million undernourished in 2007, versus 832 million in 1995.[145] The 2009 FAO estimates showed an even more dramatic increase, to 1.02 billion.[146]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of scientists have argued that the current global population expansion and accompanying increase in resource consumption threatens the world's ecosystem.[147][148]\\r\\nThe InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth, which was ratified by 58 member national academies in 1994, states that \\"unprecedented\\" population growth aggravates many environmental problems, including rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, global warming, and pollution.[149] Indeed, some analysts claim that overpopulation's most serious impact is its effect on the environment.[117]\\r\\nThe situation has continued to worsen, as at the time of the 1994 IAP statement, the world population stood at 5.5 billion and lower-bound scenarios predicted a peak of 7.8 billion by 2050, a number that current estimates state will be reached in the late 2020s.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientists contend that human overpopulation, continued human population growth and overconsumption, particularly by the wealthy, are the primary drivers of mass species extinction.[150][151][152][153] By 2050 population growth, along with profligate consumption, could result in oceans containing more plastic than fish by weight.[152] In November 2017, a statement by 15,364 scientists from 184 countries asserted that rapid human population growth is the \\"primary driver behind many ecological and even societal threats.\\"[154]\\r\\n\\r\\nA July 2017 study published in Environmental Research Letters argued that the most significant way individuals could mitigate their own carbon footprint is to have fewer children, followed by living without a vehicle, forgoing air travel and adopting a plant-based diet.[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman population control is the practice of intervening to alter the rate of population growth. Historically, human population control has been implemented by limiting a region's birth rate, by voluntary contraception or by government mandate. It has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of poverty, environmental concerns, and religious reasons. The use of abortion in some population control strategies has caused controversy,[156] with religious organizations such as the Roman Catholic Church explicitly opposing any intervention in the human reproductive process.[157]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Nebraska publication Green Illusions argues that population control to alleviate environmental pressures need not be coercive. It states that \\"Women who are educated, economically engaged, and in control of their own bodies can enjoy the freedom of bearing children at their own pace, which happens to be a rate that is appropriate for the aggregate ecological endowment of our planet.\\"[158] The book Fatal Misconception by Matthew Connelly similarly points to the importance of supporting the rights of women in bringing population levels down over time.[159]\\r\\n\\r\\nLists:\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorical:\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther reading\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganizations\\r\\n\\r\\nStatistics and maps\\r\\n\\r\\nPopulation clocks","input":"What is the current population of the world 2018?"},{"output":"Holy Ark","context":"The ark in a synagogue (also called the Torah ark or holy ark) is generally a receptacle, or ornamental closet, which contains each synagogue's Torah scrolls (Sifrei Torah in Hebrew).[1] Most arks feature a parokhet (curtain) placed either outside the doors of the holy ark (Ashkenazi and Mizrachi custom) or inside the doors of the ark (Spanish and Portuguese and Moroccan Sephardi custom).

Although they are sometimes referred to as regional languages, there is no uniformity within any Italian region, and speakers from one locale within a region are typically very aware of features that distinguish their local language from the speech of other places nearby. The official and most widely spoken language is Italian, a descendant of Tuscan.\\r\\nAll Romance languages native to Italy, except Standard Italian, are often colloquially referred to as \\"dialects\\", although for some of them the term may coexist with other labels like \\"minority languages\\" or \\"vernaculars\\".[7] However, the use of the term \\"dialect\\" to refer to the languages of Italy erroneously implies that the languages spoken in Italy are actual \\"dialects\\" of Standard Italian in the prevailing linguistic sense of \\"varieties or variations of a language.\\"[citation needed] This is generally not the case in regards to the languages of Italy, as they are, for the most part, not varieties of Standard Italian. Most of the regional languages of Italy predate Standard Italian and evolved locally from Vulgar Latin and mostly independently of what would become Standard Italian, long before the fairly recent spread of Standard Italian throughout Italy.[citation needed] In fact, Standard Italian is itself either a continuation of, or a dialect heavily based on, the Florentine Tuscan language. The indigenous local Romance speech types of Italy are thus better classified as separate languages that evolved independently from Latin, rather than \\"dialects\\" or variations of the Standard Italian language.[8][9] Conversely, with the spread of Standard Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century, local varieties of Standard Italian influenced to varying extents by the underlying local languages, most noticeably at the phonological level, have also developed throughout the peninsula; though regional boundaries seldom correspond to isoglosses distinguishing these varieties, they are commonly referred to as Regional Italian (italiano regionale).\\r\\nThere are several minority languages that belong to other Indo-European branches, such as Cimbrian (Germanic), Arb?resh (Albanian), the Slavomolisano dialect of Serbo-Croatian (Slavic), and Griko (Hellenic).

Ethnologue, not without controversy, even considers Sardinian to be four separate languages, all being included along with Corsican and the Corso-Sardinian varieties in a hypothetical subgroup named Southern Romance,[34] which has gained little support from linguists. UNESCO, while seeming to share the same opinion of Ethnologue by calling Gallurese and Sassarese alternately \\"Sardinian\\",[29] considers them to be dialects of Corsican rather than Sardinian on the other hand.[29] As is not infrequently the case in such controversies, the linguistic landscape of Sardinia is in principle most accurately described as being, for the most part, a dialect continuum.\\r\\nThe Northern Italian languages are conventionally defined as those Romance languages spoken north of the La SpeziaÿRimini Line, which runs through the northern Apennine Mountains just to the north of Tuscany; however, the dialects of Occitan and Franco-Proven?al spoken in the extreme northwest of Italy (e.g. the Vald?tain in the Aosta Valley) are generally excluded.

In Pamplona and other places, the six bulls in the event are still those that will feature in the afternoon bullfight of the same day.\\r\\nSpanish tradition says the true origin of the run began in northeastern Spain during the early 14th century. While transporting cattle in order to sell them at the market, men would try to speed the process by hurrying their cattle using tactics of fear and excitement. After years of this practice, the transportation and hurrying began to turn into a competition, as young adults would attempt to race in front of the bulls and make it safely to their pens without being overtaken. When the popularity of this practice increased and was noticed more and more by the expanding population of Spanish cities, a tradition was created and stands to this day.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pamplona[2] encierro is the most popular in Spain and has been broadcast live by RTVE, the public Spanish national television channel, for over 30 years.[6] It is the highest profile event of the San Fermin festival, which is held every year from 6ÿ14 July.[2] The first bull running is on 7 July, followed by one on each of the following mornings of the festival, beginning every day at 8?am. Among the rules to take part in the event are that participants must be at least 18 years old, run in the same direction as the bulls, not incite the bulls, and not be under the influence of alcohol.[7][8]\\r\\nIn Pamplona a set of wooden fences are erected to direct the bulls along the route and to block off side streets. A double wooden fence is used in those areas where there is enough space, while in other parts the buildings of the street act as barriers. The gaps in the barricades are wide enough for a human to slip through, but narrow enough to block a bull. The fence is composed of approximately three thousand separate pieces of wood. Some parts of the fence remain in place for the duration of the fiesta, while others are placed and removed each morning.[9] Spectators can only stand behind the second fence, whereas the space between the two fences is reserved for security and medical personnel and also to participants who need cover during the event.[8]\\r\\nThe encierro begins with runners singing a benediction. It is sung three times, each time being sung both in Spanish and Basque. The benediction is a prayer given at a statue of Saint Fermin, patron of the festival and the city, to ask the saint's protection and can be translated into English as \\"We ask Saint Fermin, as our Patron, to guide us through the encierro and give us his blessing\\". The singers finish by shouting \\"Viva San Fermn!, Gora San Fermin!\\" (\\"Long live Saint Fermin\\", in Spanish and Basque).[7] Most runners dress in the traditional clothing of the festival which consists of a white shirt and trousers with a red waistband (\\"faja\\") and neckerchief (\\"pa?uelo\\"). Also some of them hold the day's newspaper rolled to draw the bulls' attention from them if necessary.[7]\\r\\nA first rocket is set off at 8?a.m. to alert the runners that the corral gate is open. A second rocket signals that all six bulls have been released. The third and fourth rockets are signals that all of the herd has entered the bullring and its corral respectively, marking the end of the event.[7] The average duration between the first rocket and the end of the encierro is two minutes, 30 seconds.[7]\\r\\nThe encierro is usually composed of the six bulls to be fought in the afternoon, six steers that run in herd with the bulls, and three more steers that follow the herd to encourage any reluctant bulls to continue along the route. The function of the steers, who run the route daily, is to guide the bulls to the bullring.[7] The average speed of the herd is 24?km/h (15?mph).[7]\\r\\nThe length of the run is 875 meters (957 yards). It goes through four streets of the old part of the city (Santo Domingo, Ayuntamiento, Mercaderes and Estafeta) via the Town Hall Square and the short section \\"Telef܇nica\\" (named for the location of the old telephone office at end of Calle Estafeta) just before entering into the bullring through its callej܇n (tunnel).[2] The fastest part of the route is up Santo Domingo and across the Town Hall Square, but the bulls often became separated at the entrance to Estafeta Street as they slowed down. One or more would slip going into the turn at Estafeta (\\"la curva\\"), resulting in the installation of anti-slip surfacing, and now most of the bulls negotiate the turn onto Estafeta and are often ahead of the steers. This has resulted in a quicker run. Runners are not permitted in the first 50 meters of the encierro, which is an uphill grade where the bulls are much faster.[citation needed]\\r\\nEvery year, between 50 and 100 people are injured during the run.[7] Not all of the injuries require taking the patients to the hospital: in 2013, 50 people were taken by ambulance to Pamplona's hospital, with this number nearly doubling that of 2012.[10]\\r\\nGoring is much less common but potentially life threatening. In 2013, for example, six participants were gored along the festival, in 2012, only four runners were injured by the horns of the bulls with exactly the same number of gored people in 2011, nine in 2010 and 10 in 2009; with one of the latter killed.[10][11] As most of the runners are male, only 5 women have been gored since 1974. Before that date, running was prohibited for women.[12]\\r\\nAnother major risk is runners falling and piling up (a \\"mont܇n\\") at the entrance of the bullring, which acts as a funnel as it is much narrower than the previous street. In such cases injuries come both from asphyxia and contusions to those in the pile and from goring if the bulls crush into the pile. This kind of blocking of the entrance has occurred at least ten times in the history of the run, the last occurring in 2013 and the first dating back to 1878. A runner died of suffocation in one such pile up in 1977.[13]\\r\\nOverall, since record-keeping began in 1910, 15 people have been killed in the bull running of Pamplona, most of them due to being gored.[7] To minimize the impact of injuries every day 200 people collaborate in the medical attention. They are deployed in 16 sanitary posts (every 50 metres on average), each one with at least a physician and a nurse among their personnel. Most of these 200 people are volunteers, mainly from the Red Cross. In addition to the medical posts, there are around 20 ambulances. This organization makes it possible to have a gored person stabilized and taken to a hospital in less than 10 minutes.[14]\\r\\nThough there is no formal dress code, the very common and traditional attire is white pants, white shirt with a red scarf around the waist and a red handkerchief around the neck. Another common dress practice, seen as a risk by some but as a daring depiction of courage by others is dressing in a conspicuous manner. Many runners that want to be perceived as daring wear colors other than white, a common alternate color choice is blue. Blue is thought by some to draw the bulls' attention.[citation needed] Others include large logos on their shirt to capture the attention of the bulls. In the age of social media explosion, this is also thought to be a way to highlight someone in a photo.[20]\\r\\nThe encierro of Pamplona has been depicted many times in literature, television or advertising, but became known worldwide partly because of the descriptions of Ernest Hemingway in books The Sun Also Rises and Death in the Afternoon. The cinema pioneer Louis Lumire filmed the run in 1899.[21]\\r\\nThe event is the basis for a chapter in James Michener's 1971 novel The Drifters.\\r\\nThe run is depicted in the 1991 Billy Crystal film City Slickers, where the character \\"Mitch\\" (Crystal) is gored (non-fatally) from behind by a bull during a vacation with the other main characters.\\r\\nThe run appears in the 2011 Bollywood movie Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, directed by Zoya Akhtar, as the final dare in the bucket list of the three bachelors who have to overcome their ultimate fear; death. At first, the trio run part of the route. They stop at the square, but then recover their nerve, and continue to the end. The completion of the run depicts their freedom as they learn that surviving a mortal danger can bring joy.\\r\\nRunning with Bulls, a 2012 documentary of the festival filmed by Construct Creatives and presented by Jason Farrel, depicts the pros and cons of the controversial tradition.[22]\\r\\nSince 2014, the Esquire Channel has broadcast the running of the bulls as a show in the US,[23] with both live commentary and then a recorded 'round up' later in the day by NBCSN commentators the Men in Blazers, including interviews with noted participants such as Madrid-born runner David Ubeda,[24] former US Special Forces soldier turned filmmaker Dennis Clancey,[25] the historic New York-born runner Joe Distler[26] and former British bullfighter and author Alexander Fiske-Harrison.[27]\\r\\nIn 2014, the eBook guide, Fiesta: How To Survive The Bulls Of Pamplona, caused headlines around the world when one of the contributors was gored by a bull soon after its publication.[28] (See Further Reading section below.)\\r\\nAlthough the most famous running of the bulls is that of San Fermn,[2] they are held in towns and villages across Spain, Portugal, and in some cities in southern France during the summer. Examples are the bull run of San Sebastin de los Reyes, near Madrid, at the end of August which is the most popular of Spain after Pamplona, the bull run of Cullar, considered as the oldest of Spain since there are documents of its existence dating back to 1215, the Highland Capeias of the Raia in Sabugal, Portugal, with horses leading the herd crossing old border passes out of Spain and using the medieval 'Forc?o', or the bull run of Navalcarnero held at night.\\r\\nOther encierros have also caused fatalities.[29]\\r\\nBous al carrer, correbou or correbous (meaning in Catalan, bulls in the street) is a typical festivity in many villages in the Valencian region, Terres de l'Ebre, Catalonia and Fornalutx, Mallorca. Another similar tradition is soltes de vaques, where cows are used instead of bulls. Even though they can take place all along the year, they are most usual during local festivals (normally in August). Compared to encierros, animals are not directed to any bullring.\\r\\nThese festivities are normally organized by the youngsters of the village, as a way for showing their courage and ability with the bull. Some sources consider this tradition a masculine initiation rite to adulthood.[30]\\r\\nNumerous bull running events happen in France in the region around Sommires, in accordance with the Camargues tradition, in which no bull gets hurt. For instance in Calvisson, the annual event takes place around 20 July over a period of five days. There are four events: the Abrivado where over ten bulls are run together through the street guided by a group of twelve 'gardians' mounted on white Camargues horses, an Encierro where one bull is released outside the foyer and finds his own way back to the pen, the Bandido where one bull is run accompanied through the streets, and the Bandido de nuit which is the same thing but after dark. Boys and men run with the bulls and try and separate them from the horses, stop them, and physically turn them away from the horses. [31]\\r\\nThe English town of Stamford, Lincolnshire was host to the Stamford Bull Run for almost 700 years until it was abandoned in 1837.[32] According to local tradition, the custom dated from the time of King John when William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey, saw two bulls fighting in the meadow beneath. Some butchers came to part the combatants and one of the bulls ran into the town, causing a great uproar. The earl, mounting his horse, rode after the animal, and enjoyed the sport so much, that he gave the meadow in which the fight began, to the butchers of Stamford, on condition that they should provide a bull, to be run in the town every 13 November, for ever after. As of 2013 the bull run had been revived as a ceremonial, festival-style community event.\\r\\nA variation is the nightly \\"fire bull\\" where balls of flammable material are placed on the horns. Currently the bull is often replaced by a runner carrying a frame on which fireworks are placed and dodgers, usually children, run to avoid the sparks.\\r\\nIn 2008, Red Bull Racing driver David Coulthard and Scuderia Toro Rosso driver Sbastien Bourdais performed a version of a 'bull running' event in Pamplona, Spain, with the Formula One cars chasing 500 runners through the actual Pamplona route.[33]\\r\\nThe Big Easy Rollergirls roller derby team has performed a version of annual bull run in New Orleans, Louisiana since 2007. The team, dressed as bulls, skates after runners through the French Quarter. In 2012, there were 14,000 runners and over 400 \\"bulls\\" from all over the country, with huge before- and after-parties.[34][35][36]\\r\\nIn Ballyjamesduff, Ireland, an annual \\"Pig Run\\" is held with small pigs. It looks just like mini-encierro but with pigs instead of bulls.\\r\\nIn Dewey Beach, Delaware, the Starboard bar[37] sponsors an annual Running of the Bull  [sic], in which hundreds of red and white-clad beachgoers are chased down the shore by a single \\"bull\\" (two people in a costume).\\r\\nIn Rangiora, New Zealand, an annual \\"Running of the Sheep\\" is held, in which 1000ÿ2000 sheep are released down the main street of the small farming town.\\r\\nThe Running of the Bulls UK is a pub crawl event that takes place on London's Hampstead Heath and uses fast runners in place of bulls.\\r\\nIn 2014, Pamplona inaugurated a series of running events in June, the San Fermin Marathon, of a full marathon (42.195?km), half marathon (21.097?km), or 10?km road race that concludes with the final 900m of each race using the encierro route, runners crossing the finish line inside the bullring.[38]\\r\\nMany opponents argue that bulls are mentally injured by the harassment and voicing of both participants and spectators, and some of animals may also die because of the stress, especially if they are roped or bring flares in their horns (bou embolat version).[39] Despite all this, the festivities seem to have wide popular support in their villages[40]\\r\\nMany animal rights activists oppose the event. PETA activists created the \\"running of the nudes\\", a demonstration done two days before the beginning of San Fermn in Pamplona. By marching naked, they protested the festival and the following bullfight, arguing the bulls are tortured for entertainment.[41]\\r\\nThe city of San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, cancelled its Sanmiguelada running of the bulls after 2006, citing public disorder associated with the event.[42] After the event was cancelled in San Miguel, the city of Salvatierra, also in the state of Guanajuato, picked up the event. It is now called La Marquesada and the three-day event is held during the last weekend of the month of September or first weekend of October.\\r\\nSome links may contain graphic content where marked.","input":"What city is the running of the bulls?"},{"output":"Sinhala","context":"Sri Lanka Matha (Sinhalese: ????? ???? ???? ?rؐ La?k Mt; Tamil: ???? ????? ????, translit.?Srؐ La?k Ty) is the national anthem of Sri Lanka.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are differing accounts as to the origin of the Sri Lanka Matha. The most widely held view is that Sri Lankan composer Ananda Samarakoon wrote the music and lyrics to the song inspired/influenced by Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore.[1][2][3][4] A minority suggest that Tagore wrote the anthem in full.[5][6][7][8] Some have suggested that Tagore wrote the music whilst Samarakoon wrote the lyrics.[9][10] Samarakoon had been a pupil of Tagore at Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan.[11][12] After returning to Ceylon Samarakoon taught music at Mahinda College, Galle.[13][14] The song, which was then known as Namo Namo Mata, was first sung by students at Mahinda College.[15][16] After it was sung by the choir from Musaeus College, Colombo at a public event it became hugely popular in Ceylon and was widely played on radio.[17]\\r\\nPrior to Ceylon's independence (1948) the Lanka Gandharva Sabha had organised a competition to find a national anthem.[18][19] Among the entries were Namo Namo Matha by Samarakoon and Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima by P. B. Illangasinghe and Lionel Edirisinghe.[18][19] The latter won the competition but this was controversial as Illangasinghe and Edirisinghe were members of the judging panel.[18][19] Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima was broadcast by Radio Ceylon on the morning of 4 February 1948, independence day, but it was not sung at the official Freedom Day celebrations.[18][19] Ceylon continued to use the British national anthem as its official national anthem after independence.[20] At the first independence day ceremony held on 4 February 1949 at the Independence Memorial Hall in Torrington Square both Namo Namo Matha and Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima were sung, in Sinhala and Tamil, as \\"national songs\\".[18][21]\\r\\nMore specifically, in 1950 Minister of Finance J. R. Jayewardene requested that the government recognise Samarakoon's Namo Namo Matha as the official national anthem.[17] The government appointed a committee headed by Edwin Wijeyeratne, Minister of Home Affairs and Rural Development, to pick a new national anthem.[20] The committee heard several songs but, after much deliberation, picked Namo Namo Matha.[7][17][20] The committee made a minor change to Samarakoon's song, with his approval, changing the tenth line from \\"Nawajeewana Damine\\" to \\"Nawa Jeewana Demine Nithina Apapupudu Karan Matha\\".[17] The committee's decision was endorsed by the government on 22 November 1951.[13][20] The anthem was translated into the Tamil language by M. Nallathamby.[17][22][23] Namo Namo Matha was first sung as Ceylon's official national anthem at the independence day ceremony in 1952.[17][24]\\r\\nIn the late 1950s controversy arose over first line of the anthem, \\"Namo Namo Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\\".[16][17] It was deemed to be \\"unlucky\\" and blamed for the country's misfortunes including the deaths of two prime ministers.[16] In February 1961 the government changed the line to their present form, \\"Sri Lanka Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\\", despite Samarakoon's strong opposition.[17][22] Samarakoon committed suicide in April 1962, leaving a note complaining that his anthem had been mutilated.[17]\\r\\nThe Second Republican Constitution of 1978 gave Sri Lanka Matha constitutional recognition.[25]\\r\\nThe Sri Lankan national anthem is available in an identical version in two languages, Sinhala and Tamil, both official languages of the country. It is just one of a number that are sung in more than one language: Belgium (French, Dutch and German), Canada (English, French and Inuktitut), New Zealand (English and Mori), South Africa (Xhosa, Zulu, Sesotho, Afrikaans and English), Suriname (Dutch and Sranan Tongo) and Switzerland (German, French, Italian and Romansh).[23]\\r\\nSri Lanka Thaaye, the Tamil version of the Sri Lankan national anthem, is an exact translation of Sri Lanka Matha, the Sinhala version, and has the same music.[26] Although it has existed since independence in 1948 it was generally only sung in the north and east of the country where the Tamil language predominates.[26]\\r\\nThe majority of Sri Lankans (around 75%) speak the Sinhala language. More specifically, \\"Tamil is the native language for the Tamil people, who constitute about 15% of Sri Lankans, and for Muslims who are nearly 10%\\", according to the BBC.[26] Until early 2016, the Sinhala version was the only one to be used during official government events and it was the only version used during international sports and other events.[23] Although the Sinhala version of the anthem was used at official/state events, the Tamil version was also sung at some events in spite of the unofficial ban which ended in early 2016.\\r\\nThe Sinhala version of Sri Lanka Matha was used in all parts of the country with the exception of the North and the East which have a large Tamil population.[22][27][28] Some reports indicate that the Tamil version was used at official events held in the Tamil speaking regions in the North and East of Sri Lanka.[22][23] The Tamil version was sung at Tamil medium schools throughout the country.[22][23] The Tamil version was even used during the period when Sinhala was the only official language of the country (1956ÿ87).[22][23]\\r\\nOn 12 December 2010 The Sunday Times reported that the Cabinet of Sri Lanka headed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa had taken the decision to scrap the Tamil translation of Sri Lanka Matha at official and state functions, as \\"in no other country was the national anthem used in more than one language\\" - even though the national anthems of Canada, South Africa and those of several other countries have more than one language version.[27] The Cabinet's decision had followed a paper on the national flag and national anthem produced by Public Administration and Home Affairs Minister W. D. J. Senewiratne.[22][29] The paper had drawn on the Singaporean model where the national anthem is sung in the official lyrics and not any translation of the lyrics.[22] Based on this the paper recommended that the Sri Lankan national anthem only be sung in Sinhala and the Tamil translation be abolished.[22] The paper's authors had failed to realise that the official lyrics of the Singaporean national anthem are in Malay, a minority language (75% of Singaporeans are Chinese).[30]\\r\\nGovernment minister Wimal Weerawansa had labelled the Tamil version a \\"joke\\" on Derana TV, and had cited India as an analogy.[31][32][33] Some journalists, such as D. B. S. Jeyaraj,[22] claimed that it was wrong of Weerawansa to cite India as an analogy because according to them the Indian national anthem was not in Hindi, which is the most widely spoken language of India, but in Bengali, a minority language.[34][35][36][37] Although sources based on an official Government of India website state that the Indian National anthem was adopted in its Hindi version by the Constituent Assembly of India,[38][39] the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly of India on 24 January 1950 does not mention that the National Anthem was \\"adopted\\", nor does it mention that it was done so in its Hindi version.[40][41] In actual practice the unaltered Bengali version is the version sung as the National Anthem, with its words in original Bengali Tatsama, a highly Sanskritized form of Bengali that has Sanskrit words common to both Hindi and Bengali.[42]\\r\\nThe Cabinet's December 2010 decision to scrap the Tamil translation of the anthem[43] (which was not subsequently enacted) caused much furore in Sri Lanka. Later, the government denied allegations that the Tamil translation was to be abolished.[44] The Presidential Secretariat has stated that there was no basis to the media report and follow up reports which intimated the same.[45] Nevertheless, an unofficial ban[28] on the Tamil version came into being as fearful public officials in Tamil speaking areas stopped using the Tamil version or blocked attempts to use it.[23][46] The Sri Lankan Army forcefully stopped any use of the Tamil version and taught school children to sing only the Sinhala version.[46][47][48][49]\\r\\nIn March 2015 newly elected President Maithripala Sirisena announced that he would be issuing a circular which would state that there was no ban on singing the national anthem in Tamil.[50][51] Sirisena's announcement was attacked by Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists.[52][53][54][55]\\r\\nDuring Sri Lanka's 68th national independence day celebrations on 4 February 2016, the Tamil version of the anthem was sung for the first time since 1949 at an official government event, the independence day celebrations.[56] Lifting of the unofficial ban on the Tamil version had been approved by President Maithripala Sirisena (who had said he would unite the nation after the nearly 26-year civil war that ended in 2009) and by others in the government.[28] This step was viewed as part of the plan for \\"post-civil war ethnic reconciliation\\".[57]\\r\\nNaturally, Sri Lanka Matha was also sung in the majority Sinhalese. Some groups, and Sri Lanka's former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, were opposed to the government officially allowing the Tamil version to be sung.[26][58][26][59][60]\\r\\n????? ???? ????\\r\\n?? ?????....... ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n?????? ????????? ?????? ??? ?????? ????\\r\\n?????? ??? ??? ??? ?????? ???? ?? ????? ??????\\r\\n?? ?? ??? ???? ??? ???? ?????? ????\\r\\n??????? ??? ?? ????? ????\\r\\n??? ??? ????\\r\\n?? ????? ...... ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n\\r\\n?? ?? ?? ???????\\r\\n?? ?? ?? ??????\\r\\n?? ?? ?? ?????\\r\\n?? ?? ??? ?????\\r\\n?? ?? ?????\\r\\n???? ??????????\\r\\n?? ?? ???? ??\\r\\n?? ??????? ?? ??\\r\\n\\r\\n?? ???? ?????? ????? ?? ?????? ???? ????\\r\\n??? ????? ?????? ????? ??? ??? ?? ???? ???\\r\\n?? ????? ??? ??? ??????\\r\\n??? ??? ?? ?????\\r\\n?????? ??? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n?? ?????........ ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n???? ????? ???? - ??? ???? ?????\\r\\n??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n????????? ???? ?????\\r\\n??????? ?????? ???? ??????? ?????\\r\\n????? ????? ?? ???? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n????????? ???? ?????\\r\\n?????? ???????? ?? ?????????\\r\\n?????? ??? ????\\r\\n????? ?????? ???? ????????\\r\\n???????? ???? - ??? ???? ?????\\r\\n??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n\\r\\n????????? ?????\\r\\n??? ????? ??????????\\r\\n?????? ?????????\\r\\n????? ?????????? ?????\\r\\n????????? ??????\\r\\n??? ??? ?????????\\r\\n????????? ????????\\r\\n???????? ?????????\\r\\n\\r\\n?????? ??? ????\\r\\n???? ???? ?? ??????? ????\\r\\n?????????? ??? ????? ????????\\r\\n????????? ??????? ????\\r\\n?????? ???????? ??? ????\\r\\n?????? ????????????\\r\\n?? ??????? ???????? ?????\\r\\n??? ??? ???? - ??? ???? ?????\\r\\n??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\nSri Lanka Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\\r\\nNamo Namo Namo Namo Matha\\r\\nSundara siri barini\\r\\nSurendi athi sobamana Lanka\\r\\nDhanya dhanaya neka\\r\\nMal palathuru piri, jaya bhoomiya ramya\\r\\nApa hata sapa siri setha sadana\\r\\nJeewanaye Matha!\\r\\nPiliganu mena apa bhakthi puja\\r\\nNamo Namo Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\\r\\nNamo Namo Namo Namo Matha\\r\\n\\r\\nObawe apa widya\\r\\nObamaya apa sathya\\r\\nObawe apa shakti\\r\\nApa hada thula bhakthi\\r\\nOba apa aloke\\r\\nAapage anuprane\\r\\nOba apa jeewana we\\r\\nApa mukthiya obawe\\r\\n\\r\\nNawa jeewana demine\\r\\nNnithina apa pubudu karan Matha\\r\\nGnana weerya wadawamina ragena\\r\\nYanu mena jaya bhoomi kara\\r\\nEka mawekuge daru kala bawina\\r\\nYamu yamu wee nopama\\r\\nPrema wada sama bheda durara da\\r\\nNamo Namo Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\\r\\nNamo Namo Namo Namo Matha\\r\\nSrؐ la?k ty ÿ nam Srؐ la?k\\r\\nNam nam nam nam ty\\r\\nNalle?il poli cؐra?i\\r\\nNala?ka? yvum ni?ai v?ma?i la?k\\r\\n?lam puka? va?a vayal nati malai malar\\r\\nNa?u?clai ko? la?k\\r\\nNamatu?u pukali?am e?a o?irvy\\r\\nNamatuti l ty\\r\\nNamatalai ni?ata?i ml vaittm\\r\\nNamatuyir ty ÿ nam Srؐ la?k\\r\\nNam nam nam nam ty\\r\\n\\r\\nNamatraru? ?y\\r\\nNavai tavir u?arv?y\\r\\nNamatere valiy?y\\r\\nNavil cutantiram ?y\\r\\nNamati?amaiyai n??\\r\\nNaku ma?i ta?aiy??\\r\\nAmaivu?um a?ivu?a?\\r\\nA?alce?i tu?ivaru?\\r\\n\\r\\nNamatr o?i va?am\\r\\nNa?iya malar e?a nilavum ty\\r\\nYmellm oru karu?ai a?aipayanta\\r\\nE?ilko? cyka? e?av\\r\\nIyalu?u pi?avuka? tamai a?av\\r\\nI?ive?a nؐkki?uvm\\r\\nؐ?a cirma?i v?vu?u pma?i\\r\\nNam nam ty ÿ nam Srؐ la?k\\r\\nNam nam nam nam ty\\r\\nThou Mother Lanka,\\r\\nOh Mother Lanka we salute, salute, salute, salute Thee!\\r\\nPlenteous in prosperity, Thou,\\r\\nBeauteous in grace and love,\\r\\nLaden with grain and luscious fruit,\\r\\nAnd fragrant flowers of radiant hue,\\r\\nGiver of life and all good things,\\r\\nOur land of joy and victory,\\r\\nReceive our grateful praise sublime, we worship, worship Thee.\\r\\nOh Mother Lanka!

The museum was inaugurated on 18 October 1997 by King Juan Carlos I of Spain. Built alongside the Nervion River, which runs through the city of Bilbao to the Cantabrian Sea, it is one of several museums belonging to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and features permanent and visiting exhibits of works by Spanish and international artists. It is one of the largest museums in Spain.\\r\\nOne of the most admired works of contemporary architecture, the building has been hailed as a \\"signal moment in the architectural culture\\", because it represents \\"one of those rare moments when critics, academics, and the general public were all completely united about something.\\"[2] The museum was the building most frequently named as one of the most important works completed since 1980 in the 2010 World Architecture Survey among architecture experts.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991, the Basque government suggested to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation that it would fund a Guggenheim museum to be built in Bilbao's decrepit port area, once the city's main source of income.[3][4][5] The Basque government agreed to cover the US$100 million construction cost, to create a US$50 million acquisitions fund, to pay a one-time US$20 million fee to the Guggenheim and to subsidize the museum's US$12 million annual budget. In exchange, the Foundation agreed to manage the institution, rotate parts of its permanent collection through the Bilbao museum and organize temporary exhibitions.[6]\\r\\nThe museum was built by Ferrovial,[7] at a cost of US$89 million.[8] About 5,000 residents of Bilbao attended a preopening extravaganza outside the museum on the night preceding the official opening, featuring an outdoor light show and concerts. On 18 October 1997 the museum was opened by Juan Carlos I of Spain.[5]\\r\\nThe Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation selected Frank Gehry as the architect, and its director, Thomas Krens, encouraged him to design something daring and innovative.[9] The curves on the exterior of the building were intended to appear random; the architect said that \\"the randomness of the curves are designed to catch the light\\".[10] The interior \\"is designed around a large, light-filled atrium with views of Bilbao's estuary and the surrounding hills of the Basque country\\".[11] The atrium, which Gehry nicknamed The Flower because of its shape, serves as the organizing center of the museum.[6]\\r\\nWhen the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened to the public in 1997, it was immediately hailed as one of the world's most spectacular buildings in the style of Deconstructivism (although Gehry does not associate himself with that architectural movement),[12] a masterpiece of the 20th century.[13] Architect Philip Johnson described it as \\"the greatest building of our time\\",[14] while critic Calvin Tomkins, in The New Yorker, characterized it as \\"a fantastic dream ship of undulating form in a cloak of titanium,\\" its brilliantly reflective panels also reminiscent of fish scales.[13] Herbert Muschamp praised its \\"mercurial brilliance\\" in The New York Times Magazine.[15] The Independent calls the museum \\"an astonishing architectural feat\\".[11] The building inspired other structures of similar design across the globe.\\r\\nThe museum is seamlessly integrated into the urban context, unfolding its interconnecting shapes of stone, glass and titanium on a 32,500-square-meter (350,000?sq?ft) site along the Nervi܇n River in the ancient industrial heart of the city; while modest from street level, it is most impressive when viewed from the river.[15][16] With a total 24,000?m2 (260,000?sq?ft), of which 11,000?m2 (120,000?sq?ft) are dedicated to exhibition space, it had more exhibition space than the three Guggenheim collections in New York and Venice combined at that time.[5] The 11,000?m2 of exhibition space are distributed over nineteen galleries, ten of which follow a classic orthogonal plan that can be identified from the exterior by their stone finishes. The remaining nine galleries are irregularly shaped and can be identified from the outside by their swirling organic forms and titanium cladding. The largest gallery measures 30 meters wide and 130 meters long (98?ft?G 427?ft).[4][15] In 2005, it housed Richard Serra's monumental installation The Matter of Time, which Robert Hughes dubbed \\"courageous and sublime\\".[17]\\r\\nThe building was constructed on time and budget, which is rare for architecture of this type. In an interview in Harvard Design Magazine, Gehry explained how he did it. First, he ensured that what he calls the \\"organization of the artist\\" prevailed during construction, to prevent political and business interests from interfering with the design. Second, he made sure he had a detailed and realistic cost estimate before proceeding. Third, he used computer visualizations produced by his own Digital Project software and collaborated closely with the individual building trades to control costs during construction.\\r\\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines donated $1,000,000 towards its construction.\\r\\nThe museum notably houses \\"large-scale, site-specific works and installations by contemporary artists\\", such as Richard Serra's 100-meter-long (340?ft) Snake, and displays the work of Basque artists, \\"as well as housing a selection of works\\" from the Foundation's modern art collection.[11] In 1997, the museum opened with \\"The Guggenheim Museums and the Art of This Century\\", a 300-piece overview of 20th-century art from Cubism to new media art. Most pieces came from the Guggenheim's permanent collection, but the museum also acquired paintings by Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still and commissioned new works by Francesco Clemente, Anselm Kiefer, Jenny Holzer and Richard Serra.[6]\\r\\nThe exhibitions change often; the museum generally hosts thematic exhibitions, centered for example on Chinese or Russian art.[citation needed] Traditional paintings and sculptures are a minority compared to installations and electronic forms. The highlight of the collection, and its only permanent exhibit, is The Matter of Time (incorporating an earlier work, Snake), a series of weathering steel sculptures designed by Serra, which is housed in the 130-meter Arcelor Gallery (formerly known as the Fish Gallery but renamed in 2005 for the steel manufacturer that sponsored the project).[18] The collections usually highlight Avant-garde art, 20th century abstraction, and non-objective art. When the museum announced the 2011 exhibition \\"The Luminous Interval\\", a show of artwork belonging to Greek businessman Dimitris Daskalopoulos, who is also a museum trustee, this met with criticism of, among other things, too much curatorial power for a serious benefactor.[19] In 2005, Olivier Berggruen and Ingrid Pfeiffer curated a retrospective of Yves Klein.[20] In 2012 David Hockney's exhibition drew over 290,000 visitors to the museum.\\r\\nTulips by Jeff Koons\\r\\nPuppy by Jeff Koons in front of the museum\\r\\nThe museum was opened as part of a revitalization effort for the city of Bilbao.[21] Almost immediately after its opening, the Guggenheim Bilbao became a popular tourist attraction, drawing visitors from around the globe.[12] In its first three years, almost 4 million tourists visited the museum, helping to generate about ?500 million in economic activity. The regional council estimated that the money visitors spent on hotels, restaurants, shops and transport allowed it to collect ?100 million in taxes, which more than paid for the building cost.[22]\\r\\nThe building was featured in the 1999 James Bond film The World Is Not Enough in the pre-title sequence and the 2007 Tamil film Sivaji: The Boss, in which it is the setting for the song Style, composed by A.R. Rahman.[23] Mariah Carey's music video \\"Sweetheart\\", directed by Hype Williams, shows singers Jermaine Dupri and Carey in various locations at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.\\r\\nThe so-called \\"Bilbao effect\\" refers to how the museum transformed the city. The term, however, has also been employed by critics who have denounced the museum as a symbol of gentrification and cultural imperialism.[24] The Wall Street Journal suggested that the Bilbao effect should be called the Bilbao anomaly, \\"for the iconic chemistry between the design of building, its image and the public turns out to be rather rare.\\"[25]\\r\\nArt critic Brian O'Doherty was positive about approaching the building but criticized the museum's interior effect, saying \\"[O]nce you get indoors things are a little different. Even the so-called site-specific works didn't look too happy to me. Most of the interior spaces are too vast.\\" He went on to describe how works by Braque, Picasso and Rodchenko \\"looked absurd\\" and tiny on the museum's walls.[26]\\r\\nAccording to a report issued in 2007 by the Basque Court of Auditors, the museum paid more than US$27 million for the acquisition of art between 2002 and 2005, including Serra's The Matter of Time for the cavernous ground-floor gallery.[27] After another audit in 2008 revealed that money was missing from accounts,[28] the Foundation said that it filed a case against the director, Roberto Cearsolo Barrenetxea, \\"for financial and accounting irregularities\\", asserting that he had admitted diverting money from two companies that manage the Guggenheim Bilbao building and its art collection[29] to his own account since 1998.[30]\\r\\nBilbao Guggenheim\\r\\nBilbao Guggenheim\\r\\nBilbao Guggenheim\\r\\nGuggenheim Museum, Bilbao, July 2010\\r\\nBilbao Puppy by Jeff Koons\\r\\nAcrylics on fine art paper painting by I?aki Crespo\\r\\nGuggenheim Museum, Bilbao, July 2010\\r\\nGuggenheim museum at night\\r\\nGuggenheim Bilbao Museum, rear","input":"Who designed the guggenheim museum in bilbao spain?"},{"output":"October 24, 2008","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year is a 2008 American musical film and is the third installment in the High School Musical trilogy.

Troy is confused because he did not apply to Juilliard. Seeing his friends laughing, he believes they gave his name to Juilliard. Sharpay becomes desperate to win the scholarship, and knowing that Kelsi will give the best songs to Troy and Gabriella in the musical, she gets Ryan to try to persuade Kelsi to give them a song, by predicting her (and Ryan's) future (\\"I Want It All\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nThe very next day, Troy asks Gabriella to the dance while on the rooftop (seen previously in the first film as The Garden Club, a place where Troy goes seeking some quiet). She then teaches him how to waltz (\\"Can I Have This Dance?\\"). After that, Troy and Chad steal Jimmie and Donnie's clothes while they are showering, thus leading through a big chase through the halls of East High and into the auditorium and Ms. Darbus forced them to volunteer as understudies, and gives all 4 of them detention. Chad then asks Taylor to go to prom with him with a cheesy pick-up line. She initially refuses, but later relents when Chad proves he can put in some effort and asks again in front of everyone in school during lunch. The group rehearses for the musical, a scene about their prom night (\\"A Night to Remember\\"). The next day, Ryan walks in on Kelsi composing in the music room and they start to sing (\\"Just Wanna Be with You\\") which leads to Ryan asking Kelsi to prom. While Troy and Chad reminisce about their past in Reilly's Auto Parts (\\"The Boys Are Back\\"). Tiara overhears Gabriella and Taylor's conversation about the Stanford Freshman's Honors Program and informs Sharpay about it, while Sharpay convinces Troy that he is the only thing keeping Gabriella from her dream. Troy talks to Gabriella about this and after sharing an awkward goodnight, Gabriella sings (\\"Walk Away\\") and leaves for college the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nTroy's father, Jack, talks to him about his academic future, which he expects will be in the University of Albuquerque. This assumption makes Troy become angry and confused about which college he is going to, and he runs away, storming around East High bewildered until he finally screams at the top of his lungs in the theater (\\"Scream\\"). Ms. Darbus is secretly watching and reveals that she sent in his application for Juilliard. Troy later gets a call from Gabriella saying that although she loves him, she will not return to Albuquerque for prom or graduation. However, on the day of the prom, Troy visits Gabriella at Stanford University and convinces her to return and they kiss during the lunch break (\\"Can I Have This Dance? (Reprise)\\"). Back at East High, Sharpay is prepared for the last musical at East High and Troy's fellow basketball player Jimmie receives a text from Troy to tell him to cover for him onstage because he is going to be late. The Juilliard representatives are there, and watch as the show seems to go well.\\r\\n\\r\\nKelsi and Ryan start out the show followed by a couple other numbers; Jimmie then performs with Sharpay, both as understudies for Troy and Gabriella, and embarrasses her, although the audience applauds the performance. Troy and Gabriella appear during the second half of the show and sing their duet together, redoing Jimmie and Sharpay's understudied reprise. Tiara then betrays Sharpay and tells her how she is going to take over next year in the drama department. Sharpay finally learns how it feels to be manipulated and humiliated, but nevertheless does not wish to go down. While Tiara performs, Sharpay immediately crashes her performance and upstages her (\\"Senior Year Spring Musical\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the musical, Ms. Darbus reveals that both Kelsi and Ryan have won the Juilliard scholarship and tells about everyone's future plans, in which Troy reveals he's chosen \\r\\nUniversity of California, Berkeley so he can be close to Gabriella where he can play basketball and perform in theater. Taylor reveals that she will be attending Yale University with honors to study Political Science, and Sharpay and Chad revealed they would attend the University of Albuquerque, to study Performing Arts and for basketball, respectively. (\\"We're All in This Together\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the graduation ceremony, Troy gives the class speech after being selected by Ms. Darbus. Throwing their caps in the air, the graduates form a giant \\"wildcat\\" before breaking out into song and dance (\\"High School Musical\\"). As the film ends, the graduates run across the field, the curtain falls, and they appear on the East High stage. The main cast performs the song, \\"High School Musical\\", before jumping and bowing when the curtain falls.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Salt Lake City Tribune, \\"...to help lure the production back to where it all began ÿ at Salt Lake City's East High School ÿ the GOED board Friday approved a maximum $2 million incentive for the production, the largest ever given to entice a filmmaker to Utah.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincipal photography began on May 3, 2008; the 41 days scheduled for shooting was a longer period than for the first two films.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nStan Carrizosa, the winner of ABC's summer reality show, High School Musical: Get in the Picture appears in a music video \\"Just Getting Started\\" that is shown over the end credits of the theatrical release of the film.[5] The show's other 11 finalists were featured in the music video as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nZac Efron was quoted in People Magazine as saying, \\"I can tell you that if the script is good and if we all agree on a final script, then there's nothing that is going to hold us back from doing it. We have fun making these movies and that's very rare in this business.\\"[6] Rumors persisted of ongoing salary disputes between Disney and the lead performers, particularly Efron. According to Rachel Abramowitz, as reported online by the Chicago Tribune, \\"an eclectic cross-section of Hollywood insiders think Efron should get a cool $5 million for High School Musical 3, the theatrical version of the franchise, which Disney hoped to make before the Writers Guild strike and Screen Actors Guild strike shut down Hollywood for several months. Efron declined to comment for the article, and although contract negotiations still are ongoing, sources say Efron is being offered a salary closer to $3 million, not $5 million, for the follow-up, which focuses on senior year at East High. Whatever the price, he's still perceived as a steal.\\"[7] The movie was originally titled Haunted High School Musical with plans of a Halloween theme but was later scrapped.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrtega stated that pre-production would most likely start in January 2008. Filming began May 3, 2008, at East High School in Salt Lake City, Utah. He stated that the script had been submitted before the writers' strike started and that they were developing music. He added that filming will happen in Salt Lake City, Utah (as the first two films), hinted that the plot will be something of the nature of the Wildcat's final year in High School and stated, \\"it looks like we've rounded up the cast.\\"[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore filming began, the HSM3 board and cast held a press conference at East High School announcing the start of filming. The film would be released in theaters (in the United States) on October 24, 2008, though the film was to open in several countries including the UK at least one week earlier. The film had a $11 million budget and a 40-day shooting period. The film was said at the time to be the final installment with the current cast. The London premiere was the biggest London premiere of all time.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite early speculation that Vanessa Hudgens would be dropped from the film due to her nude photo scandal, The Walt Disney Company denied the reports, saying, \\"Vanessa has apologized for what was obviously a lapse in judgment. We hope she's learned a valuable lesson.\\"[12][13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 7, 2008, High School Musical 3: Senior Year: The Sing-Along Edition with lyrics highlighted on the screen was released in selected theaters.\\r\\nThe sing along version was released on May 21, 2011.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics.[16] On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 65%, based on 121 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"It won't win many converts, but High School Musical 3 is bright, energetic, and well-crafted.\\" The site also gave it a Golden Tomato for best musical film of 2008.[17] Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score, the film has a score of 57 out of 100, based on 26 critics, \\"mixed or average reviews\\".[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Telegraph praised the changes brought about by the higher budget of a theatrical release: \\"High School Musical 3 uses its bigger budget to inject colour, scale, and visual depth. The opening basketball game alone is dizzying as the camera swoops high and wide before a winning point makes the crowd erupt\\".[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nStephen Farber, for Reuters UK, says the film \\"will please fan base but won't win converts\\", as the story \\"never really does kick in\\" and that \\"the picture quickly grows tedious\\",[20] while MSNBC's Alonso Duralde describes it as \\"a stitched-together Frankenstein monster of an entertainment, featuring major components that were already trotted out the first two times.\\"[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nPeter Johnson of The Guardian describes the film as so bland that it \\"makes cellophane taste like chicken jalfrezi\\", and says that \\"the sheer squeaky-cleanness of everything is creepy, and when the characters are called upon to dance, they do so with robotic efficiency, and sing in that decaffeinated high vibrato, like 21st-century Hollywood castrati.\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nEntertainment Weekly, on the other hand, was very positive towards the film, praising the stars' energy: \\"the beauty of Efron's performance is that he's a vibrant athletic hoofer who leaps and clowns with the heartthrob vigor of a young Erika Casanova, yet he's also achingly sincere. His fast-break alertness makes him the most empathetic of teen idols; he's like a David Cassidy who knows how to act, and who can swoon without getting too moist about it. Apart from Efron, the breakout star is Ashley Tisdale, whose Sharpay makes narcissism a goofy, bedazzled pleasure.\\"[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nMovieGuide has also favorably reviewed the film, strongly recommending it for the family as \\"fun, clean and full of energy\\" and describing it as \\"thin on plot\\" yet nevertheless \\"a phenomenon.\\"[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BBC film critic Mark Kermode loved the film and said it was in his top 5 films for the year, and named Tisdale the \\"Best Supporting Actress\\" of 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fort Worth Star-Telegram stated that the latest installment was \\"critic-proof\\" and \\"everything fans could hope for and more.\\" They go on to say that \\"the kids finally look like true performers rather than Disney Channel mainstays desperately trying to remain relevant, and they deserve the lucrative careers that lie ahead\\" and gave the film a rating of four out of five stars. The film was also well received in the UK.[25] Hudgens was recognized as Favorite Movie Actress at Nickelodeon's Kids' Choice Awards, Efron was voted Best Male Performance at the 2009 MTV awards and Choice Actor: Music/Dance at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards and Tisdale was voted Breakthrough Performance Female at the 2009 MTV Movie awards and Best Supporting Actress at the 2009 UK Kermode Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film opened with $16 million on Friday for the biggest opening day for a musical film of all time until the record was topped in 2012 by Les Miserables ($18.1 million).[26] It also debuted at the #1 spot (beating out Saw V in box office earnings) with an opening weekend of over $42,030,184 in the United States and breaking the record, previously held by Enchanted, for the biggest opening ever for a movie musical.[27] This record would later be broken by Pitch Perfect 2 in 2015 ($69.2 million).[28] The film also opened at #1 overseas, with an international opening of $42,622,505.

Train services are operated by NMBS/SNCB.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe railway arrived in Bruges in 1838 when the Ghent to Bruges railway was opened, with King Leopold I and Queen Louise-Marie. A couple of weeks later the Bruges to Ostend railway was opened. In the first 6 years of its existence there was no station building, this opened in 1844, designed by Auguste Payen. The railway to Kortijk opened in 1846-1857 and lines to Eeklo and Blankenberge in 1863. The result of the success of the railways was that the station was too small. In 1879 the building was demolished and reconstructed at Ronse, where it still stands today. The new station building was completed in 1886, designed by Joseph Schadde.\\r\\nThe station was served by a daily Thalys high speed service to Paris between 1998 and 31 March 2015.[1]\\r\\nIn 2007 the station was the 10th busiest station in Belgium and there was a large increase in passengers expected over the coming years.

To compile such a streak, a player must appear in every game played by his team.  The streak is broken if the team completes a game in which the player neither takes a turn at bat nor plays a half-inning in the field. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe record of playing in 2,632 consecutive games over more than 16 years is held by Cal Ripken, Jr. of the Baltimore Orioles.  Ripken surpassed Lou Gehrig of the New York Yankees, whose record of 2,130 consecutive games had stood for 56 years.  Before Gehrig, the record was held by Everett Scott (1,307 consecutive games), a shortstop with the Red Sox and Yankees whose streak ended in 1925, less than a month before Gehrig's began. Scott broke the previous record which was established by George Pinkney (577 consecutive games) from 1885ÿ1890.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe record for a National League player is held by Steve Garvey of the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres (1975ÿ1983), though Garvey's 1,207-game streak is less than half the length of Ripken's.  Previous holders of the National League record include Billy Williams of the Chicago Cubs (1963ÿ1970), Stan Musial of the St. Louis Cardinals (1952ÿ1957), and Gus Suhr of the Pittsburgh Pirates (1931ÿ1937). \\r\\n\\r\\nOf the top 17 streaks on this list, 9 were compiled by members of the Baseball Hall of Fame.  Two others are separate streaks compiled by Pete Rose, who was named one of the top 30 players of the 20th century but is banned from the Hall of Fame.\\r\\n\\r\\nMinimum 500 consecutive games played[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nMLB's rule 10.23(c), defining consecutive game streaks, is as follows: \\"A consecutive game playing streak shall be extended if the player plays one half inning on defense, or if he completes a time at bat by reaching base or being put out. A pinch running appearance only shall not extend the streak. If a player is ejected from a game by an umpire before he can comply with the requirements of this rule, his streak shall continue.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThus it is possible for a pinch-runner to enter a game and record a statisticsteal a base, be caught stealing, or score a runwithout being credited with a (consecutive) game played. Indeed, Juan Pierre appeared in 821 consecutive games from 2002 to 2007, but on June 3, 2005, he was used solely as a pinch runner.  Under Rule 10.23(c), this resulted in separate games-played streaks of 386 and 434 games. [8]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly, a fielder can field a ball in play, make a putout or an assist, and even commit an error, without being credited with a (consecutive) game played. For example, Hideki Matsui's consecutive games streak was ended when he broke his wrist diving for a ball with two outs in the first inning of the Yankee game of May 11, 2006. That game would have been #519 in his MLB streak and #1,769 in his MLB/Japan game streak (see below), but since Matsui did not play a full half inning on defense, that game is sometimes not counted in his streak. MLB and the Society for American Baseball Research[9] both credit Matsui with having played 519 consecutive MLB games.\\r\\n\\r\\nLou Gehrig's streak started as a pinch-hitter. The next day he started at first base in place of slumping Wally Pipp[10]  and stayed there for fourteen years. On July 14, 1934, Gehrig, suffering from an attack of lumbago, was listed in the Yankee lineup at shortstop. He batted in the top of the first inning to preserve the streak, singled, and was promptly removed from the game.[11][12]  Gehrig's streak was ended by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the disease that would take his life. His physical abilities rapidly declining, Gehrig told manager Joe McCarthy to take him out of the lineup on May 2, 1939. He never played again, dying in 1941.\\r\\n\\r\\nGarvey's streak was ended when he dislocated his thumb in a home plate collision against the Atlanta Braves.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nScott's streak was ended when Manager Miller Huggins benched him in favor of Pee Wee Wanninger.\\r\\n\\r\\nRipken says that the closest he ever came to not playing during his streak was the day after he twisted his knee during a bench-clearing brawl against the Seattle Mariners in June 1993.[14] When the 1994ÿ95 player's strike threatened to destroy Ripken's streak as baseball owners planned to use replacement players, Baltimore owner Peter Angelos announced that the Orioles would rather not field a team than see Ripken's streak snapped.[15] The replacement player scenario never came to pass, as the remainder of the 1994 seasonincluding the World Serieswas cancelled due to the strike. Ripken broke Gehrig's record on September 6, 1995.[16] Ripken himself made the decision not to play on September 20, 1998, the Orioles' last home game of the season. Rookie Ryan Minor played third base for Ripken in a 5ÿ4 loss to the Yankees.[17] Ripken's record is considered by many to be unbreakable.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nMiguel Tejada's streak ended after Doug Brocail hit Tejada on the wrist with a pitch on June 20, 2007. During the game on June 21, Tejada took an at-bat in the top half of the first inning, bunting into a fielder's choice. He was removed from the game for a pinch runner, officially keeping the streak alive. But Tejada was then diagnosed with a broken wrist and went to the disabled list, ending his streak at 1,152 games.[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom June 5, 1982 to September 14, 1987, Ripken played 8,264 consecutive innings, which is believed to be a record, although not one that is officially kept by MLB. The second-longest streak known to have occurred is 5,152 consecutive innings by George Pinkney from 1885 to 1890. The World record for consecutive innings played is currently held by former Hanshin Tigers player and now coach Tomoaki Kanemoto playing 1492 games without missing an inning[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nHideki Matsui assembled a consecutive games streak of 1,769 games combined between the Japanese league Yomiuri Giants and the Major league New York Yankees. If games in Japan were counted, this would place Matsui behind only Ripken and Gehrig for streaks in Major League Baseball, although other streaks that took place solely in Japan have been longer (Sachio Kinugasa's streak of 2,215 games, which was a world record until broken by Ripken, as well at Takashi Toritani's streak of 1,895 games as of the end of the 2017 season).  The MLB portion of Matsui's streak lasted for 519 games and is a MLB record for consecutive games to start a player's career. The entire combined streak stretched from August 22, 1993, to May 10, 2006, and was ended by a wrist injury sustained during what was his 519th consecutive game (see above). The MLB portion of the streak extended from March 31, 2003 (opening day), until May 10, 2006.[23]","input":"Who is closest to cal ripken jr record?"},{"output":"between the Aucilla River and Ochlockonee River, at the head of Apalachee Bay, an area known to Europeans as the Apalachee Province","context":"The Apalachee are a Native American people who historically lived in the Florida Panhandle. They lived between the Aucilla River and Ochlockonee River, at the head of Apalachee Bay, an area known to Europeans as the Apalachee Province. They spoke a Muskogean language called Apalachee, which is now extinct.\\r\\nThe Apalachee occupied the site of Velda Mound starting about 1450 CE, but had mostly abandoned it when Spanish started settlements in the 17th century. They first encountered Spanish explorers in 1528, when the Narvez expedition arrived. Traditional tribal enemies, European diseases, and European encroachment severely reduced their population. The survivors dispersed, and over time many Apalachee integrated with other groups, particularly the Creek Confederacy, while others relocated to other Spanish territories, and some remained in what is now Louisiana. About 300 descendants in Rapides and Natchitoches parishes assert an Apalachee identity today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Apalachee spoke the Apalachee language, a Muskogean language which became extinct. It was documented by Spanish settlers in letters written during the Spanish Colonial period.\\r\\nAround 1100 indigenous peoples began to cultivate crops. Agriculture was important in the area that became the Apalachee domain. It was part of the Fort Walton Culture, a Florida culture influenced by the Mississippian culture. With agriculture, the people could grow surplus crops, which enabled them to settle in larger groups, increase their trading for raw materials and finished goods, and specialize in production of artisan goods.\\r\\nAt the time of Hernando de Soto's visit in 1539-1540, the Apalachee capital was Anhaica (present-day Tallahassee, Florida). The Apalachee lived in villages of various size, or on individual farmsteads of .5 acres (0.20?ha) or so. Smaller settlements might have a single earthwork mound and a few houses. Larger towns (50 to 100 houses) were chiefdoms. They were organized around earthwork mounds built over decades for ceremonial, religious and burial purposes.\\r\\nVillages and towns were often situated by lakes, as the natives hunted fish and used the water for domestic needs and transport. The largest Apalachee community was at Lake Jackson, just north of present-day Tallahassee. This regional center had several mounds and 200 or more houses. Some of the surviving mounds are protected in Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park,\\r\\nThe Apalachee grew numerous varieties of corn, pumpkins and sunflowers. They gathered wild strawberries, the roots and shoots of the greenbrier vine, greens such as lambsquarters, the roots of one or more unidentified aquatic plants used to make flour, hickory nuts, acorns, saw palmetto berries and persimmons. They caught fish and turtles in the lakes and rivers, and oysters and fish on the Gulf Coast. They hunted deer, black bears, rabbits, and ducks.\\r\\nThe Apalachee were part of an expansive trade network that extended from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes, and westward to what is now Oklahoma. The Apalachee acquired copper artifacts, sheets of mica, greenstone, and galena from distant locations through this trade. The Apalachee probably paid for such imports with shells, pearls, shark teeth, preserved fish and sea turtle meat, salt, and cassina leaves and twigs (used to make the black drink).\\r\\nThe Apalachee made tools from stone, bone and shell. They made pottery, wove cloth and cured buckskin. They built houses covered with palm leaves or the bark of cypress or poplar trees. They stored food in pits in the ground lined with matting, and smoked or dried food on racks over fires. (When Hernando de Soto seized the Apalachee town of Anhaico in 1539, he found enough stored food to feed his 600 men and 220 horses for five months.)\\r\\nThe Apalachee men wore a deerskin loincloth. The women wore a skirt made of Spanish moss or other plant fibers. The men painted their bodies with red ochre and placed feathers in their hair when they prepared for battle. The men smoked tobacco in ceremonial rituals, including ones for healing.\\r\\nThe Apalachee scalped opponents whom they killed, exhibiting the scalps as signs of warrior ability. Taking a scalp was a means of entering the warrior class, and was celebrated with a scalp dance. The warriors wore headdresses made of bird beaks and animal fur. The village or clan of a slain warrior was expected to avenge his death.\\r\\nThe Apalachee played a ball game, sometimes known as the \\"Apalachee ball game\\", described in detail by Spaniards in the 17th century. The fullest description,[1] however, was written as part of a campaign by Father Juan de Paiva, priest at the mission of San Luis de Talimali, to have the game banned, and some of the practices described may have been exaggerated. The game was embedded in ritual practices which Father Paiva regarded as heathen superstitions. He was also concerned about the effect of community involvement in the games on the welfare of the villages and Spanish missions. In particular, he worried about towns being left defenseless against raiders when inhabitants left for a game, and that field work was being neglected during game season. Other missionaries (and the visiting Bishop of Cuba) had complained about the game, but most of the Spanish (including, initially, Father Pavia) liked it (and, most likely, the associated gambling). At least, they defended it as a custom that should not be disturbed, and that helped keep the Apalachee happy and willing to work in the fields. The Apalachee themselves said that the game was \\"as ancient as memory\\", and that they had \\"no other entertainment ... or relief from ... misery\\".[2]\\r\\nNo indigenous name for the game has been preserved. The Spanish referred to it as el juego de la pelota, \\"the ballgame.\\" The game involved kicking a small, hard ball against a single goalpost. The same game was also played by the western Timucua, and was as significant among them as it was among the Apalachee.[3] A related but distinct game was played by the eastern Timucua; Ren Goulaine de Laudonnire recorded seeing this played by the Saturiwa of what is now Jacksonville, Florida in 1564.[3] Goalposts similar to those used by the Apalachee were also seen in the Coosa chiefdom of present-day in Alabama during the 16th century, suggesting that similar ball games were played across much of the region.[4]\\r\\nA village would challenge another village to a game, and the two villages would then negotiate a day and place for the match. After the Spanish missions were established, the games usually took place on a Sunday afternoon, from about noon until dark. The two teams kicked a small ball (not much bigger than a musket ball), made by wrapping buckskin around dried mud, trying to hit the goalpost. The single goalpost was triangular, flat, and taller than it was wide, on a long post (Bushnell described it, based on a drawing in a Spanish manuscript, as \\"like a tall, flat Christmas tree with a long trunk\\"). There were snail shells, a nest and a stuffed eagle on top of the goalpost. Benches, and sometimes arbors to shade them, were placed at the edges of the field for the two teams. Spectators gambled heavily on the games. As the Apalachee did not normally use money, their bets were made with personal goods.[5]\\r\\nEach team consisted of 40 to 50 men. The best players were highly prized, and villages gave them houses, planted their fields for them, and overlooked their misdeeds in an effort to keep such players on their teams. Players scored one point if they hit the goalpost with the ball, and two points if the ball landed in the nest. Eleven points won the game. Play was rough: players would pile on fallen players, walk on them, kick them, including in the face, pull on arms and legs and stuff dirt in each other's mouths. Players were told to die before letting go of the ball. They would try to hide the ball in their mouths; other players would choke them or kick them in the stomach to force the ball out. Arms and legs were broken. Players laid out on the ground would be revived by a bucket of cold water. There were occasional deaths. According to Father Paiva, five games in a row had ended in riots.[6]\\r\\nThe origin of the games was the subject of an elaborate mythology. The giving of challenges for a game and the erection of goalposts and players' benches involved rituals and ceremonies, \\"superstitions\\" and \\"sorceries,\\" in the view of Father Pavia. The Apalachee expanded the superstitions to include Christian elements; after losing two games in a row, one village decided that was because their mission church was closed during the games. Players also asked priests to make the sign of the cross over pileups during a game.[7]\\r\\nThe Apalachee had a relatively dense population and a complex, highly stratified society and regional chiefdom.[8] They were part of the Mississippian culture and an expansive regional trade network reaching to the Great Lakes. Their reputation was such that when tribes in southern Florida first encountered the Pnfilo de Narvez expedition, they said the riches which the Spanish sought could be found in Apalachee country.\\r\\nThe \\"Appalachian\\" place-name is derived from the Narvez Expedition's encounter in 1528 with the Tocobaga, who spoke of a country named Apalachen far to the north.[9] Several weeks later the expedition entered the territory of Apalachee north of the Aucilla River. Eleven years later the Hernando de Soto expedition reached the main Apalachee town of Anhaica, somewhere in the area of present-day Tallahassee, Florida, probably near Lake Miccosukee.[10] The Spanish subsequently adapted the Native American name as Apalachee and applied it to the coastal region bordering Apalachee Bay, as well as to the tribe which lived in it. Narvez's expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528. \\"Appalachian\\" is the fourth-oldest surviving European place-name in the U.S.[11] The name and term Appalachia is also linked to the tribe. The Yamasee Tribe had links into the mountain South. It also appears the Apalachee also had such trade and family links farther north, likely linked to Cherokee, Catawba, and other tribes.\\r\\nTwo Spanish expeditions encountered the Apalachee in the first half of the 16th century. The expedition of Pnfilo de Narvez entered the Apalachee domain in 1528, and arrived at a village, which Narvez believed was the main settlement in Apalachee.[12] Spanish attempts to overpower the Apalachee were met with resistance. The Narvez expedition turned to the coast on Apalachee Bay, where it built five boats and attempted to sail to Mexico. Only five men survived their ordeal.\\r\\nIn 1539, Hernando de Soto landed on the west coast of the peninsula of Florida with a large contingent of men and horses, to search for gold. The natives told him that gold could be found in Apalachee. Historians have not determined if the natives meant the mountains of northern Georgia, an actual source of gold, or to valuable copper artifacts which the Apalachee were known to have acquired through trade. In any case, de Soto and his men went north to Apalachee territory in pursuit of the precious metal.\\r\\nBecause of their prior experience with the Narvez expedition and reports of fighting between the de Soto expedition and tribes along the way, the Apalachee feared and hated the Spanish. When the de Soto expedition entered the Apalachee domain, the Spanish soldiers were described as \\"lancing every Indian encountered on both sides of the road.\\"[13] De Soto and his men seized the Apalachee town of Anhaica, where they spent the winter of 1539-1540.\\r\\nApalachee fought back with quick raiding parties and ambushes. Their arrows could penetrate two layers of chain mail. They quickly learned to target the Spaniards' horses, which otherwise gave the Spanish an advantage against the unmounted Apalachee. The Apalachee were described as \\"being more pleased in killing one of these animals than they were in killing four Christians.\\"[13] In the spring of 1540, de Soto and his men left the Apalachee domain and headed north into what is now the state of Georgia.[13]\\r\\nAbout 1600, the Spanish Franciscan priests founded a successful mission among the Apalachee, adding several settlements over the next century. Apalachee acceptance of the priests may have related to social stresses, as they had lost population to infectious diseases brought unwittingly by the Europeans, to which they had no natural immunity. Many Apalachee converted to Catholicism, in the process creating a syncretic fashioning of their traditions and Christianity. In February 1647, the Apalachee revolted against the Spanish near a mission named San Antonio de Bacuqua in present-day Leon County, Florida. The revolt changed the relationship between Spanish authorities and the Apalachee. Following the revolt, Apalachee men were forced to work on public projects in St. Augustine or on Spanish-owned ranches.[14][15]\\r\\nSan Luis de Talimali, the western capital of Spanish Florida from 1656 to 1704, is a National Historic Landmark in Tallahassee, Florida. The historic site is being operated as a living history museum by the Florida Department of Archeology.[16] Including an indigenous council house, it re-creates one of the Spanish missions and Apalachee culture, showing the closely related lives of Apalachee and Spanish in these settlements. The historic site received the \\"Preserve America\\" Presidential Award in 2006.[17]\\r\\nStarting in the 1670s, tribes to the north and west of Apalachee (including Chiscas, Apalachicolas, Yamasees and other groups that became known as Creeks) began raiding the Apalachee missions, taking captives that could be traded as slaves to the English in the Province of Carolina. Seeing that the Spanish could not fully protect them, some Apalachees joined their enemies. Apalachee reprisal raids, made in part to try to capture Carolinian traders, pushed the base camps of the raiders eastward, from which they continued to raid Apalachee missions as well as missions in Timucua Province. Efforts were also made to establish missions along the Apalachicola River to create a buffer zone. In particular, several missions were established among the Chatot tribe. In 1702, a few Spanish soldiers and nearly 800 Apalachee, Chatot and Timucuan warriors, on a reprisal raid after several Apalachee and Timucuan missions had been raided, were ambushed by Apalachicolas. Only 300 warriors escaped the ambush.[18]\\r\\nWhen Queen Anne's War (the North American part of the War of Spanish Succession) started in 1702, England and Spain were officially at war, and attacks by the English and their Indian allies against the Spanish and the Mission Indians in Florida and southeastern Georgia accelerated. In early 1704 Colonel James Moore of Carolina led 50 Englishmen and 1,000 Apalachicolas and other Creeks in an attack on the Apalachee missions. Some villages surrendered without a fight, while others were destroyed. Moore returned to Carolina with 1,300 Apalachees who had surrendered and another 1,000 taken as slaves. In mid-1704 another large Creek raid captured more missions and large numbers of Apalachees. In both raids missionaries and Christian Indians were tortured and murdered, sometimes by skinning them alive. These raids became known as the Apalachee Massacre. When rumors of a third raid reached the Spanish in San Luis de Talimali, they decided to abandon the province.[19] About 600 Apalachee survivors of Moore's raids were settled near New Windsor, South Carolina. Following the Yamasee War the New Windsor band joined the Lower Creek, and many returned to Florida.[20]\\r\\nWhen the Spanish abandoned Apalachee province in 1704, some 800 surviving Indians, including Apalachees, Chatots and Yemasee, fled westward to Pensacola, along with many of the Spanish in the province. Unhappy with conditions in Pensacola, most of the Apalachees moved further west to French-controlled Mobile. They encountered a yellow-fever epidemic in the town and lost more people. Later, some Apalachees moved on to the Red River in present-day Louisiana, while others returned to the Pensacola area, to a village called Nuestra Se?ora de la Soledad y San Lus. A few Apalachees from the Pensacola area returned to Apalachee province around 1718, settling near a fort that the Spanish had just built at St. Marks, Florida. Many Apalachees from the village of Ivitachuco moved to a site called Abosaya near a fortified Spanish ranch in what is today Alachua County, Florida. In late 1705 the remaining missions and ranches in the area were attacked, and Abosaya was under siege for 20 days. The Apalachees of Abosaya moved to a new location south of St. Augustine, but within a year most of them had been killed in raids. The Red River band integrated with other Indian groups, and many eventually went west with the Creeks, though others remained, and their descendants still live in Rapides Parish, Louisiana. When Florida was transferred to Britain in 1763, several Apalachee families from mission San Joseph de Escambe, then living adjacent to the Spanish presidio of Pensacola in a community consisting of 120 Apalachee and Yamasee Indians, were moved to Veracruz, Mexico. Eighty-seven Indians living near St. Augustine, some of whom may have been descended from Apalachees, were taken to Guanabacoa, Cuba.[21]\\r\\nIn the years after the United States' Louisiana Purchase, the Apalachees in Louisiana faced encroachment by settlers, and discrimination as a non-white minority, particularly severe after the end of the American Civil War. Under the state's binary racial segregation laws passed at the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, they were classified as \\"colored\\" or \\"black\\".[22]\\r\\nThe tribe's descendants in Louisiana, known as the \\"Talimali Band of Apalachee\\", still live in Rapides Parish under the guidance of Chief Gilmer Bennett. Some still live in Chopin, Louisiana, in the hills of the Kisatchie National Forest. Popular music agent \\"Tammy Taylor\\" is the granddaughter of Pleasant and Lizzie Kerry, who are direct descendants. In 1997 they started the process of seeking federal recognition. Since they have become more public, they have been invited to consult with Florida on the reconstruction at Mission San Luis, invited to pow-wows, and invited to recount Apalachee history at special events.[22][23]","input":"Where did the apalachee tribe live in florida?"},{"output":"AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat","context":"The AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat (previously called the Future Lynx and Lynx Wildcat) is an improved version of the Westland Super Lynx military helicopter designed to serve in the battlefield utility, search and rescue and anti-surface warfare roles. In British service, common variants are being operated by both the Royal Navy and British Army to replace their Lynx Mk.7/8/9 rotorcraft. The AW159 has also been offered to several export customers, and has been ordered by the Republic of Korea Navy and the Philippine Navy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, the British Government announced that the Royal Navy's existing Westland Lynx helicopters were to be replaced; at that point, the service was intended to operate an all-Merlin fleet.[3] Despite this stated intent, Westland Helicopters continued to hold talks with the Ministry of Defence (MOD) to find a future role for the type during the late 1990s; the firm issued multiple proposals to either extend the life of the existing Super Lynx through upgrade programmes or more ambitious remanufacturing programmes incorporating varying degrees of new components.[4] In 2002, the Future Lynx project originated in two studies to determine the suitability of a derivative of the Super Lynx 300 to replace the existing Lynx helicopters of the Royal Navy and British Army. These requirements were known as the Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft (SCMR) and Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter (BLUH) programmes, respectively.[5]\\r\\nIn July 2002, AgustaWestland received a contract to conduct a formal assessment phase of the Future Lynx.[6] On 22 July 2002, a collaboration agreement was signed between AgustaWestland and Thales Group, under which Thales was assigned development responsibility for the programme's core avionics, including communications, navigation, and flight management electronics;[7] that same day, additional MOD funding for the fledgling Future Lynx programme was announced as having been allocated.[8] By April 2003, the in-service dates for the BLUH and SCMR programmes were reported as being April 2007 and April 2008 respectively.[6] Early on, AgustaWestland elected to adopt a glass cockpit incorporating electronics upgrades from the AgustaWestland AW101 along with various airframe improvements, such as a redesigned tail rotor and nose, as well as an increased use of machined components over fabricated counterparts, for the Future Lynx.[6][9] By July 2004, the option of upgrading and remanufacturing the first generation Lynx had reportedly been judged to be uneconomical, and the BLUH programme of building a new generation airframe had been given prominence instead.[10]\\r\\nIn late 2004, the National Audit Office (NOA) criticised the UK's existing helicopter fleet as being insufficient; concurrently, a major reorganisation of the MOD's procurement process subjected ongoing helicopter programmes to major restructuring.[11] The BLUH was reportedly deemed unaffordable, and it was speculated that a more modest sensor fit could be used, as well as the procurement of alternative platforms such as the NHIndustries NH90, Eurocopter EC120, or Eurocopter EC635 instead of the Future Lynx.[11][12] Ultimately, the utility transport aspect of the BLUH requirement was de-emphasised and the programme renamed Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter (BRH).[13]\\r\\nIn early 2005, the MOD was reportedly deliberating on whether to launch an open competition for other companies to bid to meet the BRH requirement, or to sole-source the contract from AgustaWestland to proceed with the Future Lynx.[14] In late March 2005, the MOD confirmed the Future Lynx as being its preferred option for its rotorcraft renewal programme, and was expected to place a non-competitive contract with AgustaWestland later that year.[15][16] The signing of the contract was delayed to the following year, this was reportedly in part due to preparation and release of the 2005 Defence Industrial Strategy, which supported the selection of the Future Lynx.[9]\\r\\nOn 22 June 2006, the MOD awarded AgustaWestland a S1 billion contract for 70 Future Lynx helicopters as a commitment under the Strategic Partnering Arrangement with AgustaWestland. The programme envisaged providing the British Army with 40 aircraft and Royal Navy with 30, with an option for a further 10, split equally between Army and Navy.[17][18] By late 2007, the Future Lynx was scheduled to enter service with the British Army and Royal Navy in 2014 and 2015 respectively.[19] In 2008, the cancellation of the Future Lynx programme has reportedly been under consideration.[20] In December 2008, the MOD announced that the main contract would be proceeding, only incurring a minor cut in numbers set to be procured, for a total of 62 rotorcraft.[21]\\r\\nIn October 2007, following the passing of an interim critical design review, the Future Lynx programme proceeded to the manufacturing phase; the first metal was cut on the initial flight-test rotorcraft that same month.[19] In September 2008, the powerplant selected for the Future Lynx, the LHTEC CTS800-4N, received European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) type certification, enabling production deliveries to commence.[22] In November 2008, GKN delivered the first complete airframe to AgustaWestland; the new airframe reportedly had an 80 per cent lower part count than the earlier generation Lynx, which was achieved via the use of monolithic machine components.[23]\\r\\nOn 24 April 2009, it was announced that the Future Lynx had been designated AW159 by AgustaWestland,[24][20] and would be known in British military service as the Wildcat.[25] On 12 November 2009, the first Lynx Wildcat conducted the type's maiden flight from AgustaWestland's facility in Yeovil, Somerset.[1] On 14 October 2010, the second AW159 performed its first flight;[26] on 19 November 2010, a third Wildcat joined the flight test programme.[27] In July 2009, it was announced that the cost of the programme had increased to S1.7 billion.[28] In December 2011, it was reported that four additional Wildcats had been ordered for use by British special forces. These are to be joined by four from the current fleet on order, for a total of eight aircraft to operate as Wildcat Light Assault Helicopters.[29]\\r\\nThe AW159 Wildcat is a further development of the Westland Lynx.[30] While the AW159 shares broad similarities in appearance to the Lynx, it has significant design differences and is heavily modernised and adapted to gain new attributes and functionality.[30] The AW159 comprises 95% new components; the remaining 5%, consisting of such items as the fuel system and main rotor gearbox, are interchangeable with the Lynx AH7 and HMA8 variants.[31] During development, the Army and Navy variants of the Wildcat reportedly maintained 98 per cent commonality with one another.[20] The AW159 is the first helicopter by AgustaWestland to be designed inside an entirely digital environment.[30] Among other changes, certain external elements of the Wildcat, such as the tail rotor, have been redesigned for greater durability and stealth qualities.[30]\\r\\nBoth Army and Navy variants have a common airframe, which is manufactured by GKN Aerostructures;[20] the airframe has been marinised for operations in the naval environment and provides for a greater airframe lifespan of 12,000 flight hours.[19] The wheeled undercarriage is also strengthened for naval landings on both variants. The AW159 is powered by two 1,362?hp (1,016?kW) LHTEC CTS800 turboshaft engines which drives the rotorcraft's BERP IV rotor blades via a new transmission, increasing the maximum take-off weight by more than 1 ton over the legacy Super Lynx.[19] It is equipped with a new composite tailboom, tailplane, tail rotor, nose structure and avionics suite. The naval version is also equipped with a SELEX Galileo Seaspray 7000E active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar[13] and L-3 Wescam MX-15Di electro-optical/infrared nose turret.[32][19] A glass cockpit comprises the primary human-machine interface, using a total of four 255 x 200mm multifunction displays to provide information to the aircrew and interact with the avionics systems on board.[19]\\r\\nThe Wildcat featured an increased payload and range over the preceding Super Lynx; it is operationally required to carry up to 8 Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapons up to 185 kilometers from a host ship and remain on station for up to an hour.[19] The type can perform aerial reconnaissance, anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-surface warfare (ASuW), utility, fire control, command and control, and troop transport duties.[19] In these varied mission roles, a range of munitions can be used. In June 2014, the Royal Navy awarded Thales Group a S48 million contract to deliver the Lightweight Multirole Missile (Martlet) for the Wildcat under the Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapons Light (FASGW (L)) programme for targets such as small boats and fast attack craft. A Wildcat can carry four launchers each with five Martlets.[32] In March 2014 a contract was awarded to MBDA for the Sea Venom (FASGW Heavy) missile for use against vessels and land targets, replacing the Sea Skua.[33] Both missiles are being integrated by AgustaWestland in a single S90m programme by 2018, with IOC for both planned by October 2020.[32]\\r\\nMany elements of the AW159's avionics are provided by Thales Group.[20] The type reported to possess significant ISTAR capabilities and improved situational awareness, achieved through its onboard integrated digital open systems architecture; it has been equipped with the Bowman communications system, allowing for data such as targeting and voice communications to be securely and seamlessly transmitted to friendly forces.[30] Some AW159 models have been fitted with various General Dynamics-built mission systems, these include secured data recorders and tactical processing systems which integrate sensor data and application information for displaying within the cockpit as well as for retention within encrypted data storage.[34] Other mission systems used on the Wildcat have been produced by BAE Systems.[35] All variants of the Wildcat share the same defensive aids arrangement, which shares some commonality with the AgustaWestland Apache; features include missile warning sensors, countermeasures dispensers, and infrared exhaust suppressors.[19]\\r\\nThe UK has ordered 34 Wildcats for the British Army and 28 for the Royal Navy.[2] The Army Air Corps formed the Wildcat Fielding Team (Army), which later became 652 (Operational Conversion) Squadron, for trials and operational conversion of Joint Helicopter Command aircrew and ground crew to the type. The Royal Navy also commissioned a Wildcat Fielding Squadron, 700W Naval Air Squadron (700W NAS)[36] in 2009. Both units are located at RNAS Yeovilton. In February 2012, a prototype Wildcat (ZZ402) conducted 20 days of trials aboard HMS?Iron Duke off the coasts of England and Scotland; the tests involved operating under challenging weather conditions to define ship-helicopter operating limits for when the type enters service in 2015. During the trials, a total of 390 deck landings were completed including 148 night landings, 76 of which being conducted by pilots using night vision goggles.[37]\\r\\nThe first production Wildcat was received in May 2012 by the WFT(Army); ZZ406. The Royal Navy received their first airframe at the end of 2013. Further trials of the type were conducted, such as deck landings aboard RFA?Mounts Bay.[38] In July 2012, the Wildcat conducted its first public display at the Farnborough Airshow. At the event, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond stated that the \\"Wildcat represents a considerable advance over the current Lynx helicopters, bringing greatly improved performance and capability.\\"[39]\\r\\nOn 29 August 2014, the Wildcat AH1 formally entered service with the Army Air Corps.[2] On 23 March 2015, the Royal Navy's first Wildcat HMA2 began its initial operational deployment at sea onboard HMS?Lancaster.[40] As of September 2015, 48 Wildcats had been delivered to the British Army and Royal Navy; in excess of 10,000 flight hours had been logged between the services along with a 100 percent availability rate achieved at sea and over 1,200 deck landings performed.[41] In September 2015, a Wildcat HMA.2 of 825 Naval Air Squadron was deployed aboard HMS?Duncan in the Persian Gulf to perform extreme high temperature trials.[42]\\r\\nOn 15 January 2013, South Korea's Defense Acquisition Program Administration announced the selection of the AW159 to fulfill a requirement of the Republic of Korea Navy for a maritime helicopter, winning out against the MH-60R Seahawk. The batch of eight aircraft were chosen to perform search-and-rescue missions, anti-submarine warfare and surveillance.[43] In January 2014, DAPA announced it will equip its Wildcat helicopters with Spike NLOS missiles to provide a stand-off attack capability for engaging targets such as ground artillery and small vessels.[44] In April 2015, the South Korean government was considering ordering a further 12 Wildcats to further strengthen the Navy's anti-submarine capabilities; alternative options include the MH-60 Seahawk and the domestically produced KAI KUH-1 Surion helicopter.[45] On 13 June 2016, the Republic of Korea Navy took delivery of four Wildcats, after some unspecified initial delays. The helicopters operate from the Navy's Incheon-class guided missile/coastal defense frigates.[46] The remaining four were delivered in late November 2016. ROK Navy Wildcats are fitted with a Seaspray 7400E radar offering 360-degree coverage.[47]\\r\\nThe first four AW159s were operational by February 2017. Its AESA radar and electro-optic thermal sensor are capable of detecting surface contacts out to 360?km (220?mi; 190?nmi). For anti-submarine duties, the helicopter can operate for over three hours when equipped with the Thales FLASH dipping sonar, two hours with the sonar and one Blue Shark torpedo, and an hour or more with the sonar and two torpedoes; it can also drop sonobuoys.[48]\\r\\nIn 2014, it was reported that the AW159 was being considered by the Philippine Navy.[49] In March 2016, AugustaWestland secured a ?100 million contract with the Philippines' Department of National Defense for two helicopters along with training and support. The helicopters are scheduled to be delivered in 2018 with the aim of providing anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and anti-surface capabilities; prior to the introduction of the Wildcat, the Philippines lacked any ASW capabilities in a region where the number of submarines being operated by other nations was reportedly set to grow.[50][51]\\r\\nIn 2016, Malaysia is reportedly considering increasing the number of helicopters operated by the Royal Malaysian Navy by procuring either the AW159, Sikorsky MH-60R Seahawk or the Airbus Helicopters H225M.[52] On 20 April 2016, Finmeccanica (now Leonardo) signed a teaming agreement with Global Komited, a Malaysian defence company, to jointly promote and distribute the AW159 Wildcat to the Malaysian government.[53][54]\\r\\nIn 2016, the Bangladesh Navy floated a tender for two anti-submarine warfare helicopters. The requirement for the helicopters appear to favour the procurement of AW159 Wildcat.[55]\\r\\nData from Future Lynx brochure,[61] AW159 page,[62] militaryfactory.com[63]\\r\\nGeneral characteristics\\r\\nPerformance\\r\\nArmament\\r\\nAir-to-Surface Missile systems:","input":"What is the replacement for the lynx helicopter?"},{"output":"more than 200","context":"The following is a list of lakes in Oklahoma located entirely (or partially, as in the case of Lake Texoma) in the state.

He won the Democratic Senate primary with 51% of the votes against Geraldine Ferraro (21%) and Mark Green (19%). He then received 54% of the vote in the general election,[23] defeating three-term incumbent Republican Al D'Amato (44%).\\r\\nIn 2004, Schumer won re-election against Republican Assemblyman Howard Mills of Middletown and conservative Marilyn F. O'Grady. Many New York Republicans were dismayed by the selection of Mills over the conservative Michael Benjamin, who held significant advantages over Mills in both fundraising and organization.[24] Benjamin publicly accused GOP chairman Sandy Treadwell and governor George Pataki of trying to muscle him out of the Senate race and undermine the democratic process.[24] Schumer defeated Mills, the second-place finisher, by 2.8 million votes and won reelection with 71% of the vote.[25] Schumer won every county in the state except one, Hamilton County in the Adirondacks, the least populated and most Republican county in the state.[25] Mills conceded defeat minutes after the polls closed, before returns had come in.[25]\\r\\nA SurveyUSA poll from April 2009 placed Schumer's approval rating at 62%, with 31% disapproving.[26]\\r\\nNotable former aides to Schumer include former US congressman Anthony Weiner; and current New York state senator Daniel Squadron and New York State assembly members Phil Goldfeder and Victor M. Pichardo.[27][28]\\r\\nSchumer's propensity for publicity is the subject of a running joke among many commentators. He has been described as an \\"incorrigible publicity hound\\".[29] Bob Dole once quipped that \\"the most dangerous place in Washington is between Charles Schumer and a television camera\\",[30] while Barack Obama joked that Schumer brought along the press to a banquet as his \\"loved ones\\".[31][32][33][34] Schumer frequently schedules media appearances on Sundays on both legislative and non-legislative matters. His use of media has been cited by some as a successful way to raise a politician's profile nationally and among his constituents.[35] Schumer has appeared as a guest on The Daily Show seven times.[36]\\r\\nIn Washington, he has been the lead consensus-builder on the difficult issues of health care, immigration, and financial regulation.[37]\\r\\nIn his role as chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies for the Second inauguration of Barack Obama, Schumer played a key role in organizing the event, gave the opening speech and served as the master of ceremonies.[38] A photograph of a smiling Schumer peering from behind Malia Obama as Barack Obama took the oath of office went viral and became a meme.[39] Although it was described as a \\"photobomb\\",[40] it was not technically one as he was standing in the correct place.[41][42] The Huffington Post quipped that, \\"clearly, inauguration day belonged to Chuck Schumer.\\"[43]\\r\\nSchumer prides himself on visiting every one of New York's 62 counties each year and has successfully done so in each of the 16 years he has served in the United States Senate, the only New York senator to have done so.[44] He has a reputation for focusing on local issues that are important to average New Yorkers not normally associated with United States senators, ranging from tourism, to local taxes, to job creation.[45][46][47][48] When it was revealed that Adidas planned to end its contract for the manufacture of NBA jerseys with American Classic Outfitters, an upstate New York apparel company, and outsource production overseas, Schumer blasted the company, citing the risk to 100 workers at the plant.[49] When it was revealed that Canon Inc. was considering relocating from its corporate headquarters in Long Island because of a dispute over road infrastructure funding, Schumer stepped in to advocate New York state redirect federal stimulus dollars to make the road improvements and keep the company and its jobs on Long Island.[50] Along with his House and Senate colleagues, Schumer successfully worked to kill a Bush-era privatization plan for custodial and utility workers at the United States Military Academy at West Point. The plan would have called for turning over custodial and utility work to a Georgia company.[51]\\r\\nSchumer serves on the following Senate committees in the 115th United States Congress:[52]\\r\\nOn August 6, 2015, Schumer announced his opposition to the nuclear deal with Iran.[53] Schumer planned to tell the White House, then his Senate colleagues, and then the public, but the White House leaked the news during the Republican debate in what CBS News described as an \\"apparent attempt to limit coverage\\".[54] Arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis derided Schumer's decision, noting that Schumer was making factually incorrect claims about the amount of time in which the treaty would allow inspection of Iranian nuclear facilities.[55] In what The Guardian described as a \\"shot across Schumer's bow,\\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that fellow Democrats might remember Schumer's decision when deciding whom to elect as their next majority leader.[56]\\r\\nSchumer supported President Barack Obama's health reform legislation; he voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009,[57] and he voted for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.[58]\\r\\nIn 2009, Schumer also proposed that any new government-run health insurance programs follow all the standards applicable to private insurance. He did this to \\"address fears that a public program would drive private insurers from the market.\\" Schumer commented, saying he wanted \\"a level playing field for competition\\".[59]\\r\\nWhile serving in the House of Representatives, Schumer, along with California senator Dianne Feinstein, authored the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban which expired in 2004. The National Rifle Association and other gun groups (see gun politics) have criticized him for allegedly not knowing much about guns, alluding to various errors regarding the subject.[citation needed] Supporters of gun control legislation, however, give him much of the credit for passage of both the Assault Weapons Ban and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.[citation needed] The Assault Weapons Ban, which banned semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns with certain features, expired in September 2004 despite attempts by Schumer to extend it. He was one of 16 senators to vote against the Vitter Amendment, which prohibited the confiscation of legally owned firearms during a disaster.\\r\\nWhile a target of gun rights organizations, Schumer has supported hunters, sponsoring legislation to provide millions in outdoor recreation grants to landowners who allow hunting and fishing on their private property. For these efforts, Field and Stream magazine honored Schumer in their \\"Hero Awards\\" in 2008.[60] Schumer is also a supporter of providing hunters with tax deductions for donating venison and other game to feeding programs.[61] In response to a question in a debate during his 2010 reelection campaign, Schumer has denied having a handgun or a permit for one and has produced a letter from NYPD stating that neither he nor his wife (Iris Weinshall) has a handgun license from NYC. In a statement from Brian Fallon, a Schumer aide, he \\"insisted that except for winning an NRA marksmanship award at age 14, the senator does not own a gun or have a license to carry one\\".[62]\\r\\nSchumer is pro-choice, and has been given a 100% rating by NARAL Pro-Choice America,[63] though he received some criticism for attending a gala in 2007 hosted by Efrat an organization that seeks to reduce abortion among Israeli Jews.[64]\\r\\nSchumer has given legislative attention to consumer issues. Schumer passed legislation that required uniform disclosure information on the back of credit card applications, notifying prospective cardholders of annual fees and interest rates. This standardized information is now referred to as the \\"Schumer box\\". The senator has also aggressively pushed to end the practice whereby customers can be charged two ATM fees, once by their own bank and once by the bank who owns the ATM, if the ATM is outside their personal bank's network.[65]\\r\\nWith Congresswoman Nita Lowey, Schumer has been working to ban the chemical bisphenol A, or BPA, often found in baby bottles and plastic children's food containers.[66] The Canadian government has already banned the chemical in baby bottles and children's products.[67] Schumer is also seeking a ban on the use of cadmium, a carcinogen known to impair brain development in children, in toys and children's jewelry.[68] When companies began selling gloves, pills, inhalers, diuretics, shampoos and other products during the Swine Flu scare, Schumer urged the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to open an investigation. In the end, the FTC put ten companies on notice and identified a total of 140 scams.[69]\\r\\nSchumer has been a champion of college tuition tax credits, calling for and passing a $4,000 tuition tax credit for students as part of a host of tax credits and cuts passed to stimulate the economy in the 2009 American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA).[70]\\r\\nHe received an \\"A\\" on the most recent (2008) Drum Major Institute's Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues.[71]\\r\\nAs a senator from New York, Schumer has worked to secure homeland security funds for New York State and City and provide resources to its first responders. He delivered over $20 billion to support the state's security and recovery efforts after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York City and worked to deliver $200 million in Homeland Security funds to protect New York City mass transit.[72][73][74]\\r\\nSchumer has been a leader in the fight to continue fully funding the FIRE Grant program[75] administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The program allows fire departments and first responders nationwide to apply for grant funding for major purchases that localities have difficulty providing, namely apparatus and emergency vehicles. When the Bush administration pushed a plan to reduce the program from $1 billion to just under $300 million, Schumer helped lead an effort with local firefighters to block the cuts.[76]\\r\\nIn 2006, Schumer led a bipartisan effort, with the help of Republicans like Congressman Peter T. King (NY), to stop a deal approved by the Bush administration to transfer control of six United States ports to a corporation owned by the government of United Arab Emirates (UAE), Dubai Ports World (see Dubai Ports World controversy). The 9/11 Commission reported that, despite recent alliances with the U.S., the UAE had strong ties to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda prior to the 9/11 attacks. The measure in the House was H.R 4807, and in the Senate, S. 2333; these were introduced to require a 45-day review of this transfer of ownership. On March 9, 2006, Dubai Ports World withdrew its application to operate the ports.\\r\\nIn 1995, Schumer sponsored the Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995 (H.R. 896) in the U.S. House of Representatives.[77]\\r\\nSchumer was a supporter of the Iraq War Resolution, and a strident pro-Israel member of Congress, although he was very critical of President George W. Bush's strategy in the Iraq War; he suggested that a commission of ex-generals be appointed to review it.[78] Nat Hentoff of the Village Voice, however, wrote in November 2006 that \\"the loquacious Schumer has been indifferent to the administration's war on the Constitution and on our laws and treaties\\", particularly on the issue of torture.[79]\\r\\nThe senator also is involved with legislation to address the Darfur genocide. In 2009, he co-sponsored two bills calling for peace in Darfur. Both bills, S.455 and S.684, passed in the Senate. He also voted in favor of measures to help increase the efficiency of peace keepers serving in Darfur.\\r\\nSchumer, along with Republican senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, has been highly critical of the trade imbalance between the United States and China, and its alleged cause of Chinese currency intervention.[80] They have asked the White House, under both the Bush and Obama administrations, to find China \\"guilty of currency manipulation\\" under a 1988 law. Schumer and Graham have introduced legislation in three successive Congresses to apply tariffs onto Chinese goods for the purpose of raising the value of the Chinese yuan.\\r\\nIn a June 3, 2008, op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, Schumer wrote that cooperative economic sanctions from the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China could topple Iran's theocratic government. In discussing the importance of Russia's cooperation, Schumer stated that \\"Mr. Putin is an old-fashioned nationalist who seeks to regain the power and greatness Russia had before the fall of the Soviet Union.\\" He followed it up by noting that \\"The anti-missile system strengthens the relationship between Eastern Europe and NATO, with real troops and equipment on the ground. It mocks Mr. Putin's dream of eventually restoring Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe.\\"[81] The East European Coalition sent Schumer a letter regarding the article on June 10, 2008, writing that \\"As a supporter of democracy for the nations of Eastern Europe, which suffered greatly under 'Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe,' your suggestion that these nations be used as bargaining chips in order to appease Russia is troubling, inexplicable and unacceptable.\\"[82]\\r\\nIn 2009, Schumer criticized Scotland's release of convicted Pan Am Flight 103 bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, and called for the United States to impose economic sanctions on the United Kingdom if Megrahi's release was tied to a massive oil deal between the United Kingdom and Libya.[83]\\r\\nIn August 2013, after Russia granted asylum to Edward Snowden, Schumer said Putin was behaving like a \\"school-yard bully\\" and added, \\"The relationship between the United States and Russia is more poisonous than any time since the Cold War because of all of this.\\"[84]\\r\\nIn December 2016, Schumer demanded a congressional inquiry into Russian meddling of U.S. affairs.[85] In January 2017 he said \\"Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you,\\" in response to those questioning the U.S. intelligence community over its assessments.[86] Later that month he introduced legislation to limit executive action on Russian sanctions.[87]\\r\\nSchumer voted for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996.[88] He opposed the Federal Marriage Amendment, saying in 2004 that DOMA made it obsolete.[89]\\r\\nIn March 2009, Schumer announced his support for same-sex marriage, noting that it \\"was time\\".[90] Schumer previously supported civil unions. At a private dinner with gay leaders at the Gramercy Tavern on March 22, 2009, Schumer said he not only now supports same-sex marriage, but also backs a full reversal of DOMA.[91] When the New York State Senate took up a bill to legalize gay marriage in December 2009, Schumer, along with other statewide officials, aggressively lobbied wavering senators to support the legislation.[92]\\r\\nSchumer was one of the Gang of Eight, a bipartisan group of four Democratic and four Republican senators who wrote and sponsored a 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill. At the time, Schumer was the chairman of the Immigration, Refugees, and Border Security subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.[93] In June 2013, the immigration bill passed the Senate with a strong majority68-32, with 14 Republicans joining all Democratsbut the House of Representatives under Speaker John Boehner refused to take up the bill, and the legislation died.[94]\\r\\nIn April 2012, he introduced a bill that would kill Arizona's anti-immigration law, SB 1070 and ones like it if the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of the states. He backed his position, saying: \\"States like Arizona and Alabama will no longer be able to get away with saying they are simply 'helping the federal government' to enforce the law when they are really writing their own laws and knowingly deploying untrained officers with a mission of arresting anyone and everyone who might fit the preconceived profile of an illegal immigrant.\\"[95]\\r\\nSchumer voted on the impeachment charges of President Bill Clinton in both houses of Congress. Schumer was a member of the House of Representatives (and Judiciary Committee member) during a December 1998 lame-duck session of Congress, voting \\"no\\" on all counts in committee and on the floor of the House. In January 1999, Schumer, as a newly elected member of the Senate, also voted \\"not guilty\\" on the two impeachment charges.[96]\\r\\nAs chair of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Schumer took a lead role in the investigation of the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy.[97] Although he was at one point criticized for being a lead investigator of the affair while also chairing the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, such criticism was not sustained after the full dimensions of the controversy became apparent.[98][99]\\r\\nOn March 11, 2007, Schumer became the first lawmaker in either chamber to call for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign for the firing of eight United States Attorneys. In an interview on CBS News' Face the Nation, Schumer said that Gonzales \\"doesn't accept or doesn't understand that he is no longer just the president's lawyer.\\"[100] When Gonzales' chief of staff, Kyle Sampson, resigned on March 13, Schumer said during a press conference that Gonzales was \\"carrying out the political wishes of the president\\" and declared that Sampson would \\"not be the next Scooter Libby,\\" meaning that he did not accept that Sampson had sole responsibility for the attorney's controversy.[101]\\r\\nSchumer, like other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee from both parties, was angered during Gonzales' testimony on April 19, 2007; Gonzales answered many times that he didn't know or couldn't recall details about the controversy. When Schumer's turn came to ask his last round of questions, he instead repeated his call for Gonzales to resign, saying that there was no point to further questioning since Gonzales had \\"answered, 'I don't know' or 'I can't recall' to close to a hundred questions\\" concerning the firings (most press reports counted 71 instances) and didn't seem to know about the inner workings of his own department. Gonzales responded that the onus was on the committee to prove whether anything improper occurred. Schumer replied that Gonzales faced a higher standard, and that under this standard he had to give \\"a full, complete and convincing explanation\\" for why the eight attorneys were fired.[102]\\r\\nIn 2007, after Bush nominated former federal judge Michael Mukasey to become attorney general of the United States (replacing Gonzales, who was resigned), Schumer expressed support for Mukasey. Despite appearing troubled by Mukasey's refusal to declare in public that waterboarding was illegal torture, Schumer announced on November 2 that he would vote to confirm Mukasey.[103] Schumer said that Mukasey assured him in a private meeting that he would enforce any law declaring waterboarding illegal. Schumer also said that Mukasey told him Bush would have \\"no legal authority\\" to ignore such a law.[104] The votes of Schumer and fellow Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein, to recommend Mukasey for confirmation allowed the confirmation to move on to the full Senate.\\r\\nIn September 2007, Schumer proposed that the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) raise Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's conforming loan (\\"affordable\\") limits from $417,000 to $625,000, thereby allowing these government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to back mortgages on homes priced up to $780,000 with a 20% down payment.[105]\\r\\nFollowing the meltdown of the subprime mortgage industry in March 2007, Schumer proposed a federal government bailout of subprime borrowers in order to save homeowners from losing their residences and to shore up communities that were seeing neighborhoods destabilized due to foreclosures and the resulting decreases in neighboring home values.[106] As part of a package of regulatory reforms that Schumer has pushed in response to the subprime foreclosure crisis, he called for the creation of mortgage industry regulators to protect borrowers from deceptive lending practices and called for the Securities and Exchange Commission to relocate from Washington to New York so that it was in closer proximity to the industry it was charged with overseeing.[107]\\r\\nSchumer's top nine campaign contributors are all financial institutions that have contributed over $2.5 million to the senator.[108]\\r\\nOn June 26, 2008, Schumer took the extraordinary step of publicly releasing letters he had written to regulators regarding IndyMac Bank, the seventh largest savings and loan association and the ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the United States, which he considered to be a severely troubled institution. Schumer wrote he was \\"concerned that IndyMac's financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers and that the regulatory community may not be prepared to take measures that would help prevent the collapse of IndyMac.\\" Many depositors at IndyMac panicked or from another perspective justifably acted and withdrew funds in the 11 days before IndyMac failed.[109]\\r\\nAn audit by the Treasury Department's Inspector General would find that the primary causes of IndyMac's failure were associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing Alt-A loans on a large scale. When home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed, IndyMac was forced to hold $10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market. IndyMac's reduced liquidity was further exacerbated when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion in deposits in a \\"run\\" on the thrift following the public release of the letter. While the run was a contributing factor in the timing of IndyMac's demise, the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound manner in which the thrift was operated.[110]\\r\\nDirector of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) John Reich immediately blamed IndyMac's failure on the release of the letter. Reich said Schumer gave the bank a \\"heart attack\\" and opined, \\"Would the institution have failed without the deposit run? We'll never know the answer to that question.\\"[111] Reich and top deputies later resigned or were removed amidst a Treasury Department audit and investigation revealing that Indymac had been allowed to backdate its financial reports.[112]\\r\\nSchumer conceded his actions may have caused some depositors to withdraw their money prematurely, but suggested that \\"if OTS had done its job as regulator and not let IndyMac's poor and loose lending practices continue, we wouldn't be where we are today. Instead of pointing false fingers of blame, OTS should start doing its job to prevent future IndyMacs.\\" He pointed out that \\"IndyMac was one of the most poorly run and reckless of all the banks,\\" saying, \\"It was a spinoff from the old Countrywide, and like Countrywide, it did all kinds of profligate activities that it never should have. Both IndyMac and Countrywide helped cause the housing crisis we're now in.\\"[113][114]\\r\\nDespite IndyMac's condition before the failure, the financial media criticized the senator sharply. CNBC financial analyst Jerry Bowyer charged that Schumer was responsible for the \\"second largest bank failure in US history.\\"[115] While opining that IndyMac's failure was only a matter of time, banking consultant Bert Ely termed Schumer's actions \\"wrong and irresponsible\\".[116]\\r\\nOn October 18, 2008, The Wall Street Journal published an article suggesting that Schumer's letter may have been prompted by an investment company's interest in IndyMac.[117] His reported close ties to the founders of OneWest Bank have long been an interest to many action groups. On December 22, 2008, the Washington Post reported that OTS regional director in charge had been removed from his position for allowing IndyMac to falsify its financial reporting.[118][119] That same day, conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh not only continued to blame the senator, but recast IndyMac's July bankruptcy as an \\"October Surprise\\" planned by Democrats to help win the 2008 election.[120]\\r\\nIn 1987 then-congressman Schumer wrote a New York Times op-ed opposing the repeal of the GlassÿSteagall Act of 1933, which was entitled \\"Don't Let Banks Become Casinos\\".[121] In 1999, Schumer commented in support of Congress's repeal of the GlassÿSteagall Act of 1933: \\"There are many reasons for this bill, but first and foremost is to ensure that U.S. financial firms remain competitive.\\"[122]\\r\\nSince 2010, the securities and investment industry has been the largest donor to Schumer's senatorial campaigns.[123]\\r\\nOn December 14, 2008, a New York Times article on Schumer's role in the Wall Street meltdown stated that he embraced the industry's free-market, deregulatory agenda more than any other Democrat in Congress, backing measures blamed for contributing to the financial crisis. A review of his record showed that he took steps to protect the industry from government oversight and tougher rules. Over the years, he helped save financial institutions billions of dollars in higher taxes or fees. The article charged that Schumer succeeded in limiting efforts to reform and regulate credit-rating agencies reforms proposed by the George W. Bush Administration and the Cox SEC.[124]\\r\\nThe Charles Schumer-Rob Portman Senate bill of 2015[125] plans to tax the $2.2 trillion multinational corporations are holding outside the country in tax-haven subsidiaries, on which 35 percent is already owed, as a one-time tax \\"at a rate significantly lower than the statutory corporate rate\\".[126]\\r\\nIn his book released in March 2010, No One Would Listen, Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos passed along an unsourced claim that Schumer called the SEC for information about the Madoff investigation.[citation needed]\\r\\nSchumer had been a staunch defender of low taxes on hedge fund and private equity managers in the past, arguing that this was necessary to protect the industry. Serving on both the Senate Banking and Finance Committees, Schumer was in a position to block attempts to tax their financial gains at the rate other taxpayers pay for income.[127] In 2010, however, Schumer suggested that a hedge-fund tax would be acceptable and not hurt the industry.[128]\\r\\nIn February 2012, Schumer said that he disagreed with the Obama administration's call to raise taxes on those making more than $250,000 a year, calling for a million-dollar level instead. According to Schumer, \\"there are a lot of people who make above 250 who aren't rich.\\"[129]\\r\\nIn June 2011, the senator and colleague Joe Manchin (D-WV) sought a crackdown on Bitcoin currency, saying it facilitated illegal drug trade transactions. \\"The transactions leave no traditional [bank transfer] money trail for investigators to follow, and leave it hard to prove a package recipient knew in advance what was in a shipment,\\" which used an anonymizing network known as Tor.[130] One opinion website said the senators wanted \\"to disrupt [the] Silk Road drug website.\\"[131]\\r\\nSchumer is a sponsor of S. 968, the controversial PROTECT IP Act which would restrict access to web sites judged to be infringing copyrights.[132] On January 18, 2012, the NY Tech Meetup and other cybertech organizations held a demonstration with 2,000 protesters in front of the offices of Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, New York's other U.S. senator who also supported the bill.[133][134] Some demonstrators complained that the bill had originated with wealthy campaign contributors who would reward legislators for passing the bill.[135]\\r\\nIn March 2012, Schumer and Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal gained national attention after they called upon Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice to investigate practices by employers to require Facebook passwords for employee applicants and workers.[136]\\r\\nIn 2014, Schumer was recognized for helping to achieve the award of $700,000 in compensation monies from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for Gowanda, New York as a result of the devastating flood that occurred there in 2009.[137][138] In 2009, a flash flood devastated the village, causing two deaths. Four feet of flood waters swept through the village, and caused much damage.[137][138] The village was declared both a state and federal disaster site.[137][138]\\r\\nOf the anticipated disbursement of FEMA monies to Gowanda, New York due to the 2009 flood damage experienced there, Schumer is quoted, stating in the January 31, 2014 edition of Jamestown's The Post-Journal:\\r\\nIn April 2014, the United States Senate debated the Paycheck Fairness Act (S. 2199; 113th Congress). It was a bill that \\"punishes employers for retaliating against workers who share wage information, puts the justification burden on employers as to why someone is paid less and allows workers to sue for punitive damages of wage discrimination.\\"[139] Democrats said they intended to use the votes on this bill and the issue of equal pay as political issues in the 2014 midterm elections.[139] Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) told reporters that \\"pay equity, that's women, that's 53 percent of the vote.\\"[139]\\r\\nSchumer, speaking at an Orthodox Union event in Washington D.C, in June 2010, made comments regarding Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip that were later criticized.[140] He called on Israel to \\"strangle them economically until they see that's not the way to go\\". He explained that the current Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip is justified not only because it keeps weapons out of the Palestinian territory, but also because it shows the Palestinians living there that \\"when there's some moderation and cooperation, they can have an economic advancement.\\"[141][142] He also said, \\"The Palestinian people still don't believe in a Jewish state, in a two state solution... They don't believe in the Torah. They don't believe in King David. So, they don't think it's our land...\\"[143]\\r\\nWhile discussing an immigration bill on the Senate floor in 2010, Schumer likened Indian tech giant Infosys Technologies to a \\"chop shop.\\" When his statement set off a wave of outrage in India, the senator acknowledged his characterization was incorrect.[144][145] The remark was also criticized as \\"outrageous\\" by Ron Somers, head of the U.S.-India Business Council.[145]\\r\\nSchumer is noted for his love of cycling in New York City, especially around his home in Brooklyn.[146] In 2011 he was reported to have joined a group of neighbors who live on his street in Park Slope, near Prospect Park. They attempted to remove a new \\"protected\\" bicycle path on their street,[147] which ran adjacent to the curb with a protection buffer provided by parallel-parked cars next to the bike lane.[148] While Schumer has not taken a public position on the traffic-calming project, whose most prominent feature is a two-way protected bike path, his wife Iris Weinshall is a prominent advocate against the project, and the New York Post reported that Schumer himself has lobbied behind the scenes against the bike path.[149] In addition, a major Schumer campaign contributor[150] has fought a controversial pro bono legal battle against the safety project, drawing criticism.[151]\\r\\nSchumer was the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, part of the Democratic senate leadership, with primary responsibility for raising funds and recruiting Democratic candidates in the 2006 Senate election. When he took this post, he announced that he would not run for Governor of New York in 2006, as many had speculated he would. This step avoided a potentially divisive gubernatorial primary election in 2006 between Schumer and Eliot Spitzer, then New York's attorney general.\\r\\nWhile chairman in 2006, staffers of the committee obtained a copy of Maryland's 2006 Republican senate candidate Michael Steele's credit report. A staff researcher used Steele's social security number to obtain his credit report from TransUnion. The report was paid for with the DSCC credit card issued to the researcher's supervisor. After an internal investigation, the Maryland Democratic Party determined the credit report was obtained illegally and reported the incident to the U.S. Attorney.[152] The staffer resigned and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of computer fraud and was sentenced to 150 hours of community service.[153] The supervisor resigned from the DSCC.[154]\\r\\nUnder Schumer, in the 2006 elections, the Democratic Party gained six seats in the senate, defeating incumbents in each of those races and regaining control of the senate for the first time since 2002. Of the closely contested races in the Senate in 2006, the Democratic Party lost only Tennessee. The incoming Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, persuaded Schumer to continue to serve another term as DSCC chair.\\r\\nIn 2009, for the 111th Congress, Schumer was succeeded as the DSCC chair by senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey.\\r\\nThe Senate Democratic caucus elected Schumer minority leader in November 2016. Schumer was widely expected to lead Senate Democrats following the retirement announcement of his predecessor, Harry Reid. Schumer is the first New Yorker, as well as the first Jewish person, to serve as a Senate leader.[155]\\r\\nIn January 2007, he published a book called Positively American: Winning Back the Middle-Class Majority One Family at a Time, outlining strategies with which Democrats could court middle-class voters.

It was established in 2009 to regulate and inspect health and social care services in England.\\r\\nIt was formed from three predecessor organisations:\\r\\nThe CQC's stated role is to make sure that hospitals, care homes, dental and general practices and other care services in England provide people with safe, effective and high-quality care, and to encourage them to improve. It carries out this role through checks it carries out during the registration process all new care services must complete, inspections and monitoring of a range of data sources that can indicate problems with services.\\r\\nPart of the commission's remit is protecting the interests of people whose rights have been restricted under the Mental Health Act.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 31 March 2009, regulation of health and adult social care in England was carried out by the Healthcare Commission and the Commission for Social Care Inspection. The Mental Health Act Commission had monitoring functions with regard to the operation of the Mental Health Act 1983.\\r\\nThe commission was established as a single, integrated regulator for England's health and adult social care services by the Health and Social Care Act 2008[2][3][4] to replace these three bodies. The Commission was created in shadow form on 1 October 2008 and began operating on 1 April 2009.\\r\\nThe Commission has three chief inspectors who are also board members:\\r\\nPrevious board members have included:\\r\\nIn August 2013 the CQC stated that it was finding it difficult to meet their inspection target of GP practices and had therefore drafted in 'bank' inspectors and authorised staff overtime to deal with the backlog.[28]\\r\\nIn October 2014 Field announced that the Commission was going to begin inspecting health systems across whole geographical areas from 2015, including social care and NHS 111.[29] There are suggestions that it could inspect clinical commissioning groups.[30]\\r\\nBehan admitted in March 2015 that the Commission would not be able to inspect all acute trusts before the end of 2015 as it had intended.[31] In February 2015 it reported that it was missing its targets for following up on the safeguarding information it received that might indicate that patients are at risk.[32] He also said the CQC would update its oversight in line with the growth of new provider models and would begin looking at care quality along pathways to a greater degree and, for the first time, across localities.[33]\\r\\nThe organisation failed to meet its inspection targets during the second quarter of 2015-16. 70% of adult social care inspections had been undertaken and 61% of primary medical services. An exception to this was inspections of hospital acute services where targets were slightly exceeded, an additional 2 inspections having been made in this sector.[34]\\r\\nIn December 2015 the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was critical of the regulator, and said that it was \\"behind where it should be, six years after it was established. Meg Hillier MP, the chair of the PAC, noted that reports prepared by the CQC contained many errors; one foundation trust said that their staff had found more than 200 errors in a draft CQC report. Hillier said \\"The fact these errors were picked up offers some reassurance, but this is clearly unacceptable from a public body in which taxpayers are placing their trust.[35]\\r\\nIn July 2016 the commission issued an apology after admitting that up to 500 Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) certificates submitted by applicants to become registered managers and providers had been lost during a planned office refurbishment; a locked filing cabinet had been incorrectly marked up to be taken away and destroyed.[36]\\r\\nIn the period of August 2016 to January 2017 the CQC sent questionnaires to inpatients of NHS hospitals who had been service users in the month of July 2016. 77,850 surveys were sent out.[37]\\r\\nIn October 2016 a briefing paper issued by the organisation stated that no directorate was meeting objectives for producing reports on time. Of services which had been inspected over half had not improved their rating when re-inspected, with 45% staying at the same rating and 10% having a lower rating.[38]\\r\\nFollowing the cyber attacks on NHS systems in May 2017 it was announced that the CQC will be asking probing questions to assess data security as part of its inspection process.[39]\\r\\nAfter the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017 letters were sent to around 17,000 care homes, hospitals and hospices requesting that they review fire safety processes, paying particular attention to the sarety of service users who were more vulnerable due to mobility issues or learning disabilities.[40]\\r\\nIn November 2009 Barbara Young, then the CQC chair, resigned from the commission when a report detailing poor standards at Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was leaked to the media. The report found that \\"hundreds of people had died needlessly due to appalling standards of care.\\"[41] One month earlier the commission had rated the quality of care at the hospital as \\"good.\\"[42][43]\\r\\nIn August 2012 chief executive David Behan commissioned a report by management consultants Grant Thornton.[44] The report examined the CQC's response to complaints about baby and maternal deaths and injuries at Furness General Hospital in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria and was instigated by a complaint from a member of the public and \\"an allegation of a \\"cover-up\\" submitted by a whistleblower at CQC.\\"[45][46] It was published on 19 June 2013.[47]\\r\\nAmong the findings, the CQC was \\"accused of quashing an internal review that uncovered weaknesses in its processes\\" and had allegedly \\"deleted the review of their failure to act on concerns about University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust.\\" One CQC employee claimed that he was instructed by a senior manager \\"to destroy his review because it would expose the regulator to public criticism.\\"[47] The report concluded: \\"We think that the information contained in the [deleted] report was sufficiently important that the deliberate failure to provide it could properly be characterised as a 'cover-up'.\\"[48] David Prior, who joined the commission as chairman in January 2013, responded that the organisation's previous management had been \\"totally dysfunctional\\" and admitted that the organisation was \\"not fit for purpose.\\"[49]\\r\\nOn 20 June 2013, Behan and Prior agreed to release the names of previously redacted senior managers within the Grant Thornton report, who it is alleged had suppressed the internal CQC report. The people named were former CQC Chief Executive Cynthia Bower, deputy CEO Jill Finney and media manager Anna Jefferson. All were reportedly present at a meeting where deletion of a critical report was allegedly discussed. Bower and Jefferson immediately denied being involved in a cover-up.[50] The Guardian newspaper reported on 19 June 2013 that Tim Farron MP had written to the Metropolitan Police asking them to investigate the alleged cover-up.[51]\\r\\nFollowing an investigation, CQC found that Jefferson had not been party to any alleged 'delete' instruction. Jefferson was cleared of any wrong-doing and CQC apologised for the distress caused by the allegation.[52]\\r\\nFinney subsequently started litigation seeking at least S1.3 million libel damages from the CQC on the basis that the CQCs current chair David Prior and chief executive David Behan abused their power and acted maliciously in publishing allegations that she ordered a cover-up of its failings. The Grant Thornton report said it was more likely than not that Ms Finney had ordered the deletion of an internal report by Louise Dineley, the CQCs head of regulatory risk. The CQC started litigation against Grant Thornton claiming a contribution towards any damages, interests and/or costs incurred in the case.[53]\\r\\nResidential establishments, unlike hospitals, can easily be closed, or sold, and reopened with a new identity. Private Eye reported in November 2015 that most of the 34 homes closed under Cynthia Bower after failing their inspection later reopened with a new name or under new ownership, but with similar problems. Compassion in Care told the magazine that if a home changed name or ownership it was then listed by the CQC as \\"new services\\" and \\"uninspected\\" by the CQC, and there was no link to reports on the same establishment under different ownership, even if the new owners were linked to the previous owners, and there was no follow up inspection if problems had been identified. They had found 152 homes reregistered as new, when they had only changed owner or name. The Commission had identified safety concerns in more than 40% of the homes it had inspected, and 10% were rated as inadequate.[54]\\r\\nIn April 2016 it was reported that 44% of care homes in the South East inspected over an 18 month period were rated as inadequate or requiring improvement. Only 0.9% of the 1200 homes inspected were rated as outstanding.[55]\\r\\nIn September 2016 the CQC said that 40% of nursing homes in the country were rated as \\"requiring improvement\\" or \\"inadequate\\".[56]\\r\\nIt is a legal requirement for homes to clearly display their CQC ratings on their websites but a July 2017 survey carried out by Which? found that 27% of care homes surveyed either completely failed to display them or placed them where they were very difficult to find.[57]\\r\\nWinterbourne View was a private hospital at Hambrook, South Gloucestershire, owned and operated by Castlebeck. It was exposed in a Panorama investigation into physical and psychological abuse suffered by people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviour, first broadcast in 2011.[58] One senior nurse had reported his concerns directly to CQC, but his complaint was not taken up.[59] The public funded hospital was shut down as a result of the abuse that took place.[60] Cynthia Bower, then the chief executive of the commission, resigned ahead of a critical government report in which Winterbourne View was cited.[61]\\r\\nAsh Court is a residential nursing home for the elderly in London, operated by Forest Healthcare.[62] In April 2012 hidden camera footage was broadcast in a BBC Panorama expos which showed an elderly woman being physically assaulted at Ash Court by a male carer and mistreated by four others. The standard of care at the nursing home had been rated \\"excellent.\\"[63][64] The victim was an 81-year-old woman suffering Alzheimer's disease and severe arthritis. Although the commission's primary function is to enforce national standards including safeguarding the vulnerable and \\"enabling them to live free from harm, abuse and neglect\\" the CQC responded by stating that they \\"should not be criticised for failing to protect people from harm\\" and could not be expected to spot abuse \\"which often takes place behind closed doors.\\"[65][66]\\r\\nIn January 2015 the Commission for the first time took action in respect of primary care. Three GP practices were put into special measures after unsatisfactory inspection results: Priory Avenue Surgery in Reading, Berkshire; Dr Michael Florins surgery in Sale, Greater Manchester; and Dr Srinivas Dharmanas family and general practice in Walton, Liverpool.[67]\\r\\nPriory Avenue Surgery was taken out of the special measures category later in 2015; it was rated \\"good\\" for being caring and \\"requires improvement\\" for being safe, effective, responsive and well led.[68]\\r\\nThe CQC considered cancelling the registration of Dharmanas Family and General Practice, which would have forced it to close. This did not come about as Dr Dharmana voluntarily closed the service in December 2015.[69]\\r\\nIn October 2016 the CQC's annual report stated that around 800,000 patients were registered with a GP practice assessed as inadequate on safety grounds by their inspectors.[70]\\r\\nBy February 2017 the CQC had completed inspections of all GP practices which were registered before 1 October 2014. This amounted to more than 8,000 inspections.[71]\\r\\nIn a report to the audit committee revealed by the Health Service Journal in July 2014 it was reported that the Commission had employed 134 applicants in 2012 who failed some or all of its recruitment activities. Of that group 121 were still in post. The report said: This in essence implies that our regulatory judgments may be impaired as we have not always appointed staff with the core competencies required to do the job properly, and they may not have received appropriate training to bring them up to the standard required.[72] In the same month the chief executive David Behan said that recruiting extra inspectors was taking longer than expected due to the \\"high standards\\" set for new recruits. As a result some teams were operating at 50% capacity. In response to this situation the number of inspections scheduled for the second half of 2014 was scaled back.[73]\\r\\nA report of the CQC board in December 2014 showed the organisation had 852 full-time equivalent inspectors in post but a target of 1,411 by December 2015 - the number needed to discharge the commitments that weve made in our business plan.[74]\\r\\nThe budget for 2015/6 was S249 million, but is to be reduced to S236 million for 2016/7.[75] It is anticipated that by 2019/20 the budget will be S217 million.[76] It had a budget of S1.1 million for travel and subsistence for hospital inspections in 2014-15, but actually spent S4.4 million.[77] In response to a Freedom of information request in November 2015 it was stated that CQC have a database support contract with Computacenter which costs approximately S700,000 per annum; the contract expires in September 2016 with the option of a 1 year extension.[78]\\r\\nSubstantial increases are expected in future years as it moves to a full cost recovery basis.[79] NHS Providers described the decision to increase fees as \\"regrettable\\".[80] For 2016/7 fees will increase by 75% as its government funding is reduced by 25%. The increase in fee levels has been criticised by the Registered Nursing Home association (RNHA), Care England and the Voluntary Organisations Disability Group (VODG).[81]\\r\\nFees relate to the size and type of organisation and have been increased on a yearly basis:","input":"Who is responsible for regulating the care sector?"},{"output":"PewDiePie","context":"This article lists the fifty most-subscribed channels on the video platform YouTube.[2] The ability to \\"subscribe\\" to a user's channel was added to YouTube by late October 2005,[3] and the \\"most subscribed\\" list on YouTube began as a chart by May 2006, at which time Smosh was number one with fewer than three thousand subscribers.[4] Since December 22, 2013, the most subscribed user has been PewDiePie, whose channel has over 62 million subscribers as of April 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table lists the fifty most subscribed channels on YouTube, with each total rounded down to the nearest million subscribers, as well as the network and language of each channel.

Prior to the arrival of European-Americans, about one half of the United States land area was forest, about 1,023,000,000 acres (4,140,000?km2) estimated in 1630. Recently, the Forest Service reported total forestation as 766,000,000 acres (3,100,000?km2) in 2012.[1][2][3] The majority of deforestation took place prior to 1910 with the Forest Service reporting the minimum forestation as 721,000,000 acres (2,920,000?km2) around 1920.[4] The forest resources of the United States have remained relatively constant through the 20th century.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2005 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Global Forest Resources Assessment ranked the United States as seventh highest country losing  its old growth forests, a vast majority of which were removed prior to the 20th century.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 300 years following the arrival of Europeans, land was cleared, mostly for agriculture, at a rate that matched that of population growth.[5] For every person added to the population, one to two hectares of land was cultivated.[6] This trend continued until the 1920s when the amount of crop land stabilized in spite of continued population growth. As abandoned farm land reverted to forest the amount of forest land increased reaching a peak in 1963 of 753,000,000 acres (3,050,000?km2).[1] After 1963 there was a gradual decrease through the next few decades which has been reversed with recovery and slight gains in the early 21st century. Gains in forest land have resulted from conversions from crop land and pastures at a higher rate than loss of forest to development. Because urban development is expected to continue, an estimated 93,000 square kilometres (23,000,000 acres) of forest land is projected be lost by 2050,[7] a 3% reduction from 1997. Other qualitative issues have been identified such as the continued loss of old-growth forest,[8] the increased fragmentation of forest lands, and the increased urbanization of forest land.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDeforestation in the United States is affected by many factors. One such factor is the effect, whether positive or negative, that the logging industry has on forests in the country. Logging in the United States is a hotly debated topic as groups who either support or oppose logging argue over its benefits and negative effects. \\"This industry comprises the establishments primarily engaged in one or more of the following: (1) cutting timber; (2) cutting and transporting timber; (3) producing wood chips in the field, the definition provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The United States is the second  leading producer and consumer of forest products and accounts for about one-fourth of the worlds production and consumption. The United States is also the worlds second largest producer of softwood and hardwood lumber. In 1996, total annual sales for commercial (nonfederal) timber and nontimber forest products was approximately $3.8 billion.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest issue thought to be facing deforestation in the United States is illegal logging in forests although facts prove otherwise from habitat and forest cover loss annually to catastrophic fire. More than 83 million acres have been lost to wildfire from 2005 to date.[11] The United States Forest Service states that illegal logging is the biggest problem with deforestation because it is nearly impossible to monitor and stop.[citation needed] It goes on throughout the U.S. and other countries and often happens when companies disregard their permits and go beyond what they are allowed to harvest. The Forest Service and EPA work together to make sure that the permits for logging companies in the United States are granted in such a way that the forests are kept healthy and sustainable, and illegal logging reduces the chances that forests will be kept this way.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Forest Service is in favor of logging to a certain extent[citation needed] but there are several groups that oppose logging in the United States. Groups such as EarthRoots.org state that logging in the United States and specifically in industrial areas has led to deforestation and near extinction of many animals.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nForest cover in the Eastern United States reached its lowest point in roughly 1872 with about 48 percent compared to the amount of forest cover in 1620.

The U.S. gained three points for their win and was off to a great start in the \\"Group of Death\\" claimed by critics for the teams the U.S. would have to go through (Germany, Ghana, and Portugal).\\r\\nThe second match of the World Cup for the U.S. was a different story. Portugal claimed the early lead, with Nani scoring in the 5th minute to take the early 1ÿ0 lead. It wasn't till the 64th minute till the U.S. scored the equalizing goal, thanks to Jermaine Jones, tying the match at 1 apiece. The U.S. then claimed the lead on a goal by Clint Dempsey again, scoring in the 81st minute to take a 2ÿ1 lead. However, in the final minute of extra time, the world player of the year, Cristiano Ronaldo drilled a perfect cross to teammate Silvestre Varela who headed in the tying goal, making the final score 2ÿ2. The tie gave each team a point in the overall standings, bringing the U.S. to 4 points total, and gave Portugal their first point of the World Cup having lost their opening match to Germany, 4ÿ0. The U.S. claimed a spot in the knockout round in spite of a 1ÿ0 loss to eventual champion Germany in their final group game due to them winning the tiebreaker with Portugal. However, they bowed out the tournament in the round of 16 in a 2ÿ1 loss to Belgium. Goalkeeper Tim Howard helped the U.S. keep a 0ÿ0 tie at full time. In extra time, there were two Belgian goals. The U.S. struck back with a goal by 19-year-old phenom Julian Green but could not manage another goal. Klinsman was let go as USMNT Director of Coaching and was replaced by Bruce Arena in November 2016.\\r\\nThe U.S. finished in fifth place in the fifth round of the CONCACAF qualification tournament for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which concluded in October 2017. This marks the first time that the U.S. failed to qualify for the World Cup since 1986. As a result of the fifth-place finish, Bruce Arena was let go as USMNT Director of Coaching later that month.\\r\\nUnited States, jointly with Canada and Mexico, is competing against Morocco to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The host will be announced on June 13, 2018 in Moscow, Russia.\\r\\nThe women's national team has won three FIFA Women's World Cup tournaments in 1991, 1999 and 2015 (placing second in 2011 and third in 1995, 2003, and 2007); the Olympic Gold Medal in 1996, 2004, 2008, and 2012; and seven Algarve Cups and six CONCACAF Women's Gold Cups.\\r\\nThe FIFA Women's World Cup was inaugurated in 1991, and the women's national team became the first team to win the prize after beating Norway in the final.\\r\\nIn 1999, the United States hosted the FIFA Women's World Cup for the first time. During their tournament run, the women's national team established a new level of popularity for the women's game, culminating in a final against China that drew 90,185 fans, an all-time attendance record for a women's sports event, to a sold-out Rose Bowl. After neither team scored in regulation or extra time, the final went to a penalty shootout, which the United States won 5ÿ4. The celebration by Brandi Chastain after she converted the winning penalty, in which she took off her shirt, revealing her sports bra in the process, is one of the more famous images in U.S. women's sports.\\r\\nU.S. Soccer Federation oversees and promotes the development of the following national youth teams:[13]\\r\\nThe U.S. Paralympic Soccer Team is an elite level program for men that selects players from across the United States in preparation for International standard competition. The team competes in 7-a-side football. The squad is composed of athletes who have cerebral palsy or have suffered a stroke or traumatic brain injury. The program is Coached by Stuart Sharp under the oversight of the U.S. Soccer Federation.[14]\\r\\nU.S. Soccer House is located in two refurbished mansions at 1801 South Prairie Avenue in Chicago, Illinois and serves as the headquarters for the U.S. Soccer Federation.[15]\\r\\nIn 2003, U.S. Soccer opened their National Training Center at StubHub Center in Carson, California. The $130 million facility includes a soccer-specific stadium, home to the MLS team Los Angeles Galaxy. Additionally, four grass soccer fields, a FieldTurf soccer field and a general training area are specifically dedicated to U.S. Soccer. Both the senior and youth men's and women's US national teams hold regular camps at StubHub Center.[16]\\r\\nU.S. Soccer was also exploring a possibility of building the National Training and Coaching Development Center in Kansas City, Kansas.[17] On April 9, 2015, the Training Center received final approval from the local governments. U.S. Soccer agreed to a 20-year lease, with the project set to break ground in 2016 and finishing some time in 2017.[18][19]\\r\\nDespite the growth of men's and women's professional soccer in the United States in the last few decades, by far the largest category of soccer in the United States, at least in terms of participation, is boys and girls youth soccer. Though organized locally by organizations all over the United States, there are two main youth soccer organizations working nationwide through affiliated local associations. The United States Youth Soccer Association boasts over three million players between the ages of five and 19, while American Youth Soccer Organization has more than 300,000 players between the ages of four and 19. This makes soccer one of the most played sports by children in the United States.\\r\\nThe professional first-division league in North America is Major League Soccer which, as of the upcoming 2018 season, has 20 teams in the U.S. and 3 in Canada. The league has added three teams since 2017 with the addition of Atlanta United FC and Minnesota United FC in 2017 and Los Angeles FC in 2018, and plans to add five more teams no later than the early 2020s. The league operates as a single-entity league, which means MLS, and not the individual teams, holds the contracts on players.\\r\\nThe one sanctioned second-division men's outdoor soccer league is the United Soccer League (USL). Previously, the second North American Soccer League had second-division status, sharing it with the USL in the 2017 season, but the NASL was denied second-division sanctioning for 2018 due to considerable instability in the league.[20]\\r\\nThe new NASL has no official tie to the former NASL that operated from 1968 to 1984; though, some of the teams share names with their historic counterparts. Unlike MLS that is a single-entity operation, the new NASL, like the old NASL, has no salary cap and players are contracted by the individual teams.[21] The season is a split format (similar to that of many leagues in Latin America) that features seven teams, including one Puerto Rican team. Previous to the reorganization of the NASL in 2009, the USL First Division operated as the professional second-division league in the United States. However, a dispute among its teams and ownership led to the creation of the NASL which applied for and was awarded by USSF second division status. The 2010 season was played as a combined USL/NASL league format before NASL officially separated in 2011.[22]\\r\\nThe United Soccer Leagues (USL) were a collection of five leagues spanning the lower divisions of men's professional soccer, as well as women's soccer and youth soccer. After the 2010 season, the USL folded its former First and Second Divisions into a new professional third-division league, USL Pro, that launched in 2011. At launch, it had 15 teams: 11 on the U.S. mainland, three in Puerto Rico, and one in Antigua and Barbuda. The Puerto Rican teams, plagued by ownership and economic issues, were dropped from the league after 2011, and the Antigua team discontinued operations after a winless 2013 season. In January 2013, USL and MLS reached an agreement to integrate USL Pro league competition with the MLS Reserve League spawning the creation of secondary teams directly affiliated with MLS franchises. This was done primarily to improve player development in North America, strengthen league competition and build ties between divisions in the American soccer pyramid. This multi-year deal encourages MLS and USL Pro team affiliations and player loans, and it will lead to more games for teams and to the development of American players. The deal has proven to be a boon for USL Pro, and in 2015, after a rebrand to USL, 24 teams were participating in a healthy and stable 3rd division.[23][24] USL was provisionally sanctioned as a second-division league for 2017, claiming that their final applications met all the standards for second-division sanctioning.[25][26]\\r\\nThere are currently no sanctioned third-division leagues. Two leagues have indicated that they will seek third-division status. United Soccer Leagues, administrator of the USL and PDL leagues, announced that they would start a new league, tentatively called D3, and seek third-division certification and targeting 2019 as the first season for the new league.[27] National Independent Soccer Association (NISA) led by former Chicago Fire general manager Peter Wilt plans on fielding 8-10 teams in 2018 and has stated that it will seek third-division certification.[28]\\r\\nA fourth-division league in the United States is the Premier Development League, which as of 2015 is expected to have 58 U.S. teams, and six Canadian teams. Though the PDL does have some paid players, it also has many teams that are made up entirely or almost entirely of college soccer players who use the league as an opportunity to play competitive soccer in front of professional scouts during the summer, while retaining amateur status and NCAA eligibility. Another fourth-division league in the United States is the National Premier Soccer League.\\r\\nIn addition to MLS and the USL, the United States Adult Soccer Association governs amateur soccer competition for adults throughout the United States, which is effectively the amateur fifth-division of soccer in the United States. The USASA sanctions regional tournaments that allow entry into the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, the oldest continuous national soccer competition in the United States. Since 1914, the competition has been open to all U.S. Soccer affiliated clubs, and currently pits teams from all five levels of the American soccer pyramid against each other each year, similarly to England's FA Cup.\\r\\nWomen's soccer in the United States has been played at the professional level in three separate leagues since 2001. The first two attempts at professional leagues lasted three seasons each.\\r\\nThe Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) was founded in 2001. Headlined by the stars of the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup-winning team, $30 million dollars was initially invested by numerous cable tv networks and owners.[29] The league's inaugural match was held between the Washington Freedom featuring Mia Hamm and the Bay Area CyberRays (featuring Brandi Chastain) at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C.. In addition to the 34,148 fans in attendance being greater than any MLS game that weekend, the Turner Network Television (TNT) broadcast reached 393,087 households: more than two MLS games broadcast on ESPN and ESPN2.[30] The league folded in 2003.\\r\\nThe second attempt, Women's Professional Soccer, was founded in 2009, and featured involvement of many former WUSA figures. The champion of WPS' first season in 2009 was Sky Blue FC, out of the New YorkÿNew Jersey area. They defeated the Los Angeles Sol 1ÿ0 at The Home Depot Center in Carson, California. WPS launched with seven teams, all based in the United States. The Sol folded after the league's inaugural season, and two new teams joined for 2010, bringing WPS to eight teams. However, the 2010 season saw considerable instability, with another charter team, Saint Louis Athletica, folding during the season, champions FC Gold Pride folding after the season, and the Chicago Red Stars deciding to regroup in the second-tier Women's Premier Soccer League (WPSL). The 2011 season, in which six teams based along the East Coast played, was marked by low attendance for most of the season and conflict with Dan Borislow, who had purchased the former Washington Freedom, moved the team to South Florida, and renamed it magicJack. The dispute between WPS and Borislow led the league to suspend the magicJack franchise, with Borislow responding by suing. The legal battle led WPS to suspend its 2012 season, with hopes of returning in 2013, but WPS soon decided to fold completely.\\r\\nOn November 21, 2012, U.S. Soccer, in conjunction with the Canadian Soccer Association (CSA) and Mexican Football Federation (FMF), announced the formation of a new professional league for the 2013 season.[31] The league, unnamed at the time of the initial announcement but later unveiled as the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), launched in April 2013 with eight teams.[31] Like WUSA and WPS, NWSL teams are privately owned with some owned by existing MLS teams.[32] The American and Canadian federations pay the salaries for many of their respective national team members. U.S. Soccer initially committed to funding up to 24 national team members, with the CSA committing to paying 16 players and FMF pledging support for at least 12 and possibly as many as 16.[32][33] In addition, U.S. Soccer housed the league's front office for the first four years, and scheduled matches to avoid any possible conflict with international tournaments.[32] Four of the league's charter teams had WPS tiesthe Boston Breakers, Chicago Red Stars, Sky Blue FC, and the Western New York Flash. The other four initial teams were located in the Kansas City, Portland, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. markets with the Portland team run by the Portland Timbers of MLS.[32] The NWSL expanded to nine teams for 2014 by adding the Houston Dash, run by the Houston Dynamo of MLS. In 2016, it expanded to 10 with the addition of another MLS-backed team, the Orlando Pride. Ahead of the 2017 season, A&E Networks announced it had taken an equity stake in the league and Lifetime would begin broadcasting games to a national television audience.[34] As of 2017[update], additional expansion teams were being discussed by Los Angeles FC, Vancouver Whitecaps, and FC Barcelona.[35][36][37]\\r\\nIn 2014 parents and former players filed a Class Action Lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, FIFA, and other Soccer Organizations for failure to create policies that would prevent, evaluate and manage concussion injuries.[38] Soccer is second only to American football in the number of concussion injuries per year.[39]\\r\\nThe USSF has been accused by representatives of the North American Soccer League, among others, of unfairly protecting MLS's leading role in American professional soccer. Among their concerns is that the USSF benefits from financial dealings with MLS that it does not have with other leagues, giving it an apparent incentive to protect MLS from competition.[40] This includes the contract that the USSF has with MLS's Soccer United Marketing (SUM) subsidiary in which most USSF sponsorship, television licensing and royalty revenues (outside of its apparel deal with Nike, Inc.) are paid through SUM. The USSF reported $15,433,754 in revenues through the SUM relationship in its 2014 audited financial report.[41]\\r\\nIn 2015, the NASL took issue with proposed USSF rule changes reportedly making it harder to gain co-equal \\"Division 1\\" status with MLS that would increase the NASL's influence within the USSF as well as presumably allow more access to international competition and larger media and sponsorship contracts, calling the draft proposal \\"...an anti-competitive bait and switch, with the purpose of entrenching MLSs monopoly position at the very time when the NASL is threatening to become a significant competitor.\\"[42] Seats on the USSF's Professional Council governing committee are also based proportionally on pyramid level, giving MLS more votes when choosing the two professional league representatives on the USSF's Board of Directors. In 2015, those representatives are MLS Commissioner Don Garber and Alec Papadakis, CEO of the United Soccer League that announced an affiliation with MLS in 2015.\\r\\nHigh-profile international soccer figures including former USMNT Head Coach Jrgen Klinsmann,[43] former LA Galaxy head coach and USMNT Head Coach Bruce Arena[44] and Manchester City manager and former FIFA World Coach of the Year Pep Guardiola,[45] have expressed beliefs that the top-down structure of soccer developed and managed by the USSF in the United States, including pressure to have the best American players in MLS rather than higher-quality leagues in other countries, is hampering the nation's competitiveness in international soccer.\\r\\nConversely, Klinsmann has been criticized in turn by MLS representatives for recommending that American players leave MLS development systems to pursue professional careers in Europe in order to test themselves against higher levels of players in preparation for international competition. In 2015, MLS Commissioner Don Garber said, \\"I do believe our national team coach has a short-term objective. That's what he's hired to do. That doesn't mean next week, but it's to win the Gold Cup, it's to have the best possible team in 2018. And our goals and objectives are broader than that, and that's why we agree on some things but don't agree on others.\\"[46]\\r\\nMen's coaches\\r\\nWomen's coaches\\r\\nTechnical Staff\\r\\nUnited States Soccer Football Association (until 1974)\\r\\nUnited States Soccer Federation (1974ÿpresent)","input":"Where does the us national soccer team train?"},{"output":"Boston Americans","context":"The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) and concludes the MLB postseason.

The show had an ensemble cast that featured Bob Denver, Alan Hale Jr., Jim Backus, Natalie Schafer, Russell Johnson, Tina Louise, and Dawn Wells. It aired for three seasons on the CBS network from September 26, 1964, to April 17, 1967. Gilligan's Island followed the comic adventures of seven castaways as they attempted to survive the island on which they had been shipwrecked. Most episodes revolve around the dissimilar castaways' conflicts and their unsuccessful attempts, for whose failure Gilligan was frequently responsible, to escape their plight.[1]\\r\\nGilligan's Island ran for a total of 98 episodes. The first season, consisting of 36 episodes, was filmed in black and white. These episodes were later colorized for syndication. The show's second and third seasons (62 episodes) and the three television movie sequels (aired between 1978 and 1982) were filmed in color.\\r\\nThe show received solid ratings during its original run, then grew in popularity during decades of syndication, especially in the 1970s and 1980s when many markets ran the show in the late afternoon after school. Today, the title character of Gilligan is widely recognized as an American cultural icon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two-man crew of the charter boat SS Minnow and five passengers on a \\"three-hour tour\\" from Honolulu run into a tropical storm and are shipwrecked on an uncharted island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.\\r\\nThe island was close enough to Hawaii to clearly pick up Hawaiian AM radio transmissions on a portable receiver. The location given in the series varies.\\r\\nIn the first-season episode \\"'X' Marks the Spot\\", the radio warns that the Air Force will test launch an armed missile to strike a location near 140 latitude, 10 longitude (note: this is an impossible locationlatitude goes only up to 90, which is at the poles) The Skipper calculates this as their island's location, based on their starting point when the storm hit before they \\"...?drifted for that three days?... with the prevailing western current?...\\", meaning the deadly missile will hit the island.[2]\\r\\nLater in the first season, the episode \\"Big Man on Little Stick\\" has the Professor giving the position as \\"approximately 110 longitude and 10 latitude\\".[3]\\r\\nIn the third-season episode \\"The Pigeon\\", the island is placed about 300 miles (480?km) southeast of Honolulu.\\r\\nThe pilot episode, titled \\"Marooned\\", was filmed in November 1963.\\r\\nThe pilot featured seven characters (as in the series), but only four of the characters? and their associated actors? were carried forward into the series: Gilligan (Denver), the Skipper (Hale), and the two Howells (Backus and Schafer). As it happens, only these four characters/actors were featured in the opening theme song \\"cast list\\" used in the pilot, with the remaining three characters only mentioned as \\"the other tourists\\", although the earlier part of the song gave brief descriptions of all passengers.\\r\\nDue to the three significant character and casting changes between the pilot episode and the first series episode, the pilot was not shown before the series first aired on 26 September 1964. The original pilot eventually aired over 29 years later (on TBS 16 October 1992).\\r\\nThe three characters who did not carry forward from the pilot were two secretaries and a high school teacher. In the pilot, the scientifically inclined Professor was instead a high school teacher played by John Gabriel. Ginger the movie star was still red haired Ginger, but worked as a secretary, played by Kit Smythe. Mary Ann the Kansas farm girl was instead Bunny, Ginger's co-worker, played as a cheerful \\"dumb blonde\\" by Nancy McCarthy.\\r\\nThe pilot's opening and ending songs were two similar Calypso-styled tracks written by John Williams and performed by Sherwood Schwartz impersonating singer Sir Lancelot. The lyrics of both were quite different from those of the TV series and the pilot's opening theme song was longer. The short scenes during this initial music include Gilligan taking the Howells' luggage to the boat before cast-off and Gilligan attempting to give a cup of coffee to the Skipper during the storm that would ultimately maroon the boat.\\r\\nAfter the opening theme song and credits end, the pilot proper begins with the seven castaways waking up on the beached SS Minnow and continues with them performing various tasks, including exploring the island, attempting to fix the transmitter, building huts, and finding food. Contrary to some descriptions, the pilot's storylines contained no detailed accounts of the pilot characters' backgrounds. The pilot concludes with the ending theme song and credits.\\r\\nThe background music and even the laugh tracks of the pilot appear all but identical to those used during the series.\\r\\nThe first episode actually broadcast, \\"Two on a Raft\\", is sometimes wrongly referred to as the series pilot. This episode begins with the same scene of Gilligan and the Skipper awakening on the boat as in the pilot (though slightly differently cut, to eliminate most shots of the departed actors) and continues with the characters sitting on the beach listening to a radio news report about their disappearance. No equivalent scene or background information is in the pilot, except for the description of the passengers in the original theme song. Rather than reshooting the rest of the pilot story for broadcast, the show just proceeded on. The plot thus skips over the topics of the pilot; the bulk of the episode tells of Gilligan and the Skipper setting off on a raft to try to bring help, but unknowingly landing back on the other side of the same island.\\r\\nThe scene with the radio report is one of two scenes that reveal the names of the Skipper (Jonas Grumby) and the Professor (Roy Hinkley); the names are used in a similar radio report early in the series. The name Jonas Grumby appears nowhere else in the series except for an episode in which the Maritime Board of Review blames the Skipper for the loss of the ship. The name Roy Hinkley is used one other time when Mr. Howell introduces the Professor as Roy Huntley and the professor corrects him, to which Mr. Howell replies, \\"Brinkley, Brinkley.\\"\\r\\nThe plot for the pilot episode was eventually recycled into that season's Christmas episode, \\"Birds Gotta Fly, Fish Gotta Talk\\", in which the story of the pilot episode, concerning the practical problems on landing, is related through a series of flashbacks. Footage featuring characters that had been recast was reshot using the current actors. For scenes including only Denver, Hale, Backus, and Schafer, the original footage was reused.\\r\\nThe last episode of the show, \\"Gilligan the Goddess\\", aired on April 17, 1967, and ended just like the rest, with the castaways still stranded on the island. It was not known at the time that it would be the series finale, as a fourth season was expected but then cancelled.[7]\\r\\nIn its last year, Gilligan's Island was the lead-in program for the CBS Monday night schedule. It was followed for the first 16 weeks by the sitcom Run, Buddy, Run. The time slot from 7:30 to 8:30?p.m. Eastern was filled in the 1967ÿ1968 season by Gunsmoke, moved from its traditional Saturday 10?p.m. time slot.\\r\\nThe shipwrecked castaways desperately want to leave the remote island, and various opportunities are frequently presenting themselves. They typically fail owing to some bumbling error committed by Gilligan (with the notable exception of \\"The Big Gold Strike\\", where everyone except Gilligan is responsible for their failed escape). Sometimes this would result in Gilligan saving the others from some unforeseen flaw in their plan.[8]\\r\\nRecurring elements center on one of five primary themes. The first deals with life on the island. A running gag is the castaways' ability to fashion a vast array of useful objects from bamboo and other local material. Some are simple everyday things, while others are stretches of the imagination. Russell Johnson noted in his autobiography that the production crew enjoyed the challenge of building these props. Some bamboo items include framed huts with thatched grass sides and roofs, along with bamboo closets strong enough to withstand hurricane-force winds and rain; the communal dining table and chairs, pipes for Gilligan's hot water, a stethoscope, and a pedal-powered car. Many scenes occur at the dining table, where the castaways enjoy a large number of dishes that Ginger and Mary Ann prepare while the radio provides news and entertainment. Gilligan and the Skipper often catch fish, and the island has citrus trees to avoid scurvy and a good supply of fresh water to drink and to prepare tropical drinks. . While most are explained due to the Professor (or occasionally Gilligan's) ingenuity, sometimes they are also explained due to the being washed up on shore or falling off cargo ships. Naturally, despite their obvious skill and inventiveness, the castaways never quite manage to put together a functional raft out of bamboo (or repair the holes in the Minnow, though the entire ship fell apart in the eighth episode, \\"Goodbye Island\\"[9]). In the television movie Rescue from Gilligan's Island, the castaways tie all their huts together and use that as a raft for escape, taking advantage of a tsunami's propulsion.\\r\\nThe second theme involves visitors to the \\"uncharted\\" island. One challenge to a viewer's suspension of disbelief is the remarkable frequency with which the island is visited by an assortment of people who repeatedly fail to assist the castaways in leaving the island. Some have hidden motives for not aiding the castaways. Others are simply unable to help, are incompetent, or are foiled in their efforts to help by Gilligan's bumbling. Gilligan, Ginger and Mr. Howell each had feature episodes in which look-alikes visit the island (who were played by the actors in dual roles, or made use of spiltscreen camera or stand-ins in the event the doppelgangers appeared on simultaneously). The island itself is also home to an unusual assortment of animal life, some native, some visiting.\\r\\nThe third recurring theme is the use of dream sequences in which one of the castaways \\"dreams\\" he or she is some character related to that week's storyline. All of the castaways appeared as other characters within the dream. In later interviews and memoirs, nearly all of the actors stated that the dream episodes were among their personal favorites.\\r\\nThe fourth recurring theme is a piece of news concerning the castaways arriving from the outside world that causes discord among them. Then, a second piece of news arrives that says the first was incorrect. An exception to the latter part of this statement is the episode \\"The Postman Cometh\\", where Gilligan and the Skipper hear over the radio that Mary Ann's boyfriend eloped and the three single men try to cheer her up by wooing her; Mary Ann actually lied about having a boyfriend, and she created a romance with \\"a real creep\\" so that the others would think she had someone waiting for her back home.\\r\\nThe fifth recurring theme is the appearance or arrival of strange objects, like a WWII mine, a crate of radioactive vegetable seeds or a \\"Mars Rover\\" that the scientists back in the USA think is sending them pictures of Mars, and in one episode a meteorite.\\r\\nMost of the slapstick comedic sequences between Hale and Denver were heavily inspired by Laurel and Hardy, particularly by Hale breaking the fourth wall by looking directly into the camera expressing his frustration with Denver's clumsiness as Oliver Hardy often did.[10]\\r\\nFilming of the show took place at the CBS Radford Studios complex in Studio City, Los Angeles.[11] The same stage was later used for The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Roseanne, which featured Gilligan's Island prominently on one episode. The lagoon was drained and used as a parking lot during the show's off-season and was the last surviving element of the show when it was demolished in 1997 as part of an expansion project.[12]\\r\\nFour different boats played the part of the SS Minnow. One was used in the opening credits and rented in Ala Wai Yacht Harbor in Honolulu. Another boat, the Bluejacket, was used in the opening credits shown during the second and third seasons and eventually turned up for sale on Vancouver Island in August 2006, after running aground on a reef in the Hecate Strait on the way south from Alaska. One boat was used for beach scenes after being towed to Kauai in Hawaii. The fourth Minnow was built on the CBS Studios set in the second season.[13] The Minnow was named in reference to Newton Minow, chairman of the U.S. FCC, who was most famous for describing television as \\"a vast wasteland\\".[14]\\r\\nThe final day of filming the pilot was Friday, November 22, 1963, the day of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.[15] The cast and crew found out about the assassination late that morning, Hawaii time.[15] Between the filming of scenes, they crowded around a radio, listening to news bulletins.[15] A reminder of the tragedy appears in the opening sequence of the show's first season, when the theme song is played. As the Minnow is leaving the harbor and heading out to sea, an American flag flying at half staff can be seen briefly in the background.[15][16]\\r\\nThe United States Coast Guard occasionally received telegrams from concerned citizens, who apparently did not realize it was a scripted show, pleading for them to rescue the people on the deserted island. The Coast Guard simply forwarded these telegrams to producer Sherwood Schwartz.[17] In homage to those telegrams, the film Rescue from Gilligan's Island showed the successful rescue where Gilligan lights a fire aboard the castaways' makeshift raft and is chastised for a thoughtless, dangerous action by the others. However, the resultant smoke attracts the attention of a US Coast Guard helicopter, whose pilot commends Gilligan's fire; otherwise the castaways would have been adrift and unnoticed.\\r\\nThe music and lyrics for the theme song, \\"The Ballad of Gilligans Isle\\", were written by Sherwood Schwartz and George Wyle. One version was used for the first season and another for the second and third seasons. In the original song, the Professor and Mary Ann, originally considered \\"second-billed co-stars\\", were referred to as \\"the rest\\", but with the growing popularity of those characters, their names were inserted into the lyrics. The Gilligan theme song underwent this one major change due to star Bob Denver, who personally went to the studio executives and asked that Johnson and Wells be added to the theme song's opening credits.[18] When the studio at first refused, saying it would be too expensive to reshoot, Denver insisted, even going so far as to state that if Johnson and Wells were not included, he wanted his name out of the song, as well. The studio caved in, and \\"the Professor and Mary Ann\\" were added.[19][20][21]\\r\\nThe first-season version was recorded by the folk group The Wellingtons. The second-season version, which incorporated more of a sea shanty sound, was uncredited, but according to Russell Johnson in his book Here on Gilligan's Isle, it was performed by a group called the Eligibles.[22]\\r\\nThe show's original pilot episode featured a Calypso theme song by future film composer John Williams, and different lyrics. The original length of the voyage was \\"a six-hour ride\\", not \\"a three-hour tour\\".[23] John Williams (or Johnny Williams as he was often listed in the show credits) also started out as the composer of the incidental music for the show (from 1964 to 1965), but was replaced by Gerald Fried for the remaining seasons (1965ÿ1967).[24]\\r\\nThe band Little Roger and the Goosebumps recorded \\"Stairway to Gilligan's Island,\\" a parody of Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", substituting the words to the Gilligan's Island theme song.[25] \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic recorded a song called \\"Isle Thing\\", a parody of Tone Lc's \\"Wild Thing\\", about a rapper whose girlfriend introduces him to the show. Yankovic also used one verse from the closing theme lyrics in \\"Amish Paradise\\" (1996), a parody of Coolio's \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\" (1995). The song has also been covered by many bands, including Bowling for Soup for the TBS show The Real Gilligan's Island.[26] Israel Kamakawiwo?ole also recorded a comic tribute to the theme song on his album E Ala E.\\r\\nDuring the 1966ÿ1967 television season, Gilligan's Island aired on Monday nights at 7:30?p.m. Though the sitcom's ratings had fallen well out of the top-30 programs, during the last few weeks of its third season, the series was more than holding its own against its chief competitor, The Monkees, which aired at the same time on NBC-TV. Therefore, CBS assured Sherwood Schwartz that Gilligan's Island would definitely be picked up for a fourth year.\\r\\nCBS, however, had signaled its intention to cancel the long-running Western series Gunsmoke, which had been airing late on Saturday nights during the 1966ÿ1967 television season. Under pressure from CBS network president William S. Paley and his wife Babe, along with many network affiliates and longtime fans of Gunsmoke, CBS rescheduled the Western to an earlier time slot on Monday evenings at 7:30?p.m. As a result, Gilligan's Island was quietly cancelled at practically the last minute, while the cast members were all on vacation. Some of the cast had bought houses based on Sherwood Schwartz's verbal confirmation that the series would be renewed for a fourth season.[27]\\r\\nIn a 1978 made-for-television movie, Rescue from Gilligan's Island, the castaways do successfully leave the island, but have difficulty reintegrating into society. During a reunion cruise on the first Christmas after their rescue, fate intervenes and they find themselves wrecked on the same island at the end of the film. It starred the original cast, except for Tina Louise, who refused to participate due to her disputes with the producers and was replaced by Judith Baldwin. The plot involved Soviet agents seeking a memory disc from a spy satellite that landed on the island and facilitated their rescue.\\r\\nIn a 1979 sequel, The Castaways on Gilligan's Island, they are rescued once again, and the Howells convert the island into a getaway resort with the other five castaways as \\"silent partners\\". Ginger was again played by Judith Baldwin.\\r\\nIn a second sequel, The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island (1981), villains played by Martin Landau and then-wife Barbara Bain try to take over the island to gain access to a vein of \\"supremium\\", a valuable but volatile element. This time, Ginger was played by Constance Forslund. They are thwarted by the timely intervention of the Harlem Globetrotters. Jim Backus, who was in poor health at the time, was written out of the script by saying Thurston Howell III was tending to Howell Industries back on the mainland. David Ruprecht played the role of his son, Thurston Howell IV, who was asked to manage the resort. However, Backus insisted on keeping continuity, and made a cameo appearance at the end of the film.\\r\\nThe New Adventures of Gilligan was a Filmation-produced animated remake that aired on ABC on Saturday mornings from September 7, 1974, to September 4, 1977, for 24 episodes (16 installments airing in 1974ÿ75 and eight new ones combined with repeats in 1975ÿ76). The voices were provided by the original cast except for Ginger and Mary Ann (both were voiced by Jane Webb). Dawn Wells could not participate due to her appearing in an on-the-road play.[citation needed] An additional character was Gilligan's pet Snubby the Monkey.\\r\\nGilligan's Planet was an animated science-fiction version produced by Filmation and starring the voices of the Gilligan's Island cast, save for Tina Louise (Dawn Wells voiced both Mary Ann and Ginger). In a follow-up to The New Adventures of Gilligan, the castaways escape from the island by building a spaceship, and get shipwrecked on a distant planet. Only 12 episodes aired on CBS between September 18, 1982, and September 3, 1983. In the episode \\"Let Sleeping Minnows Lie\\", they travel to an island, get shipwrecked there, and Gilligan observes, \\"First we were stranded on an island, then we were stranded on a planet, and now we're stranded on an island on a planet.\\"\\r\\nGood Morning America featured a Gilligan's Island reunion presided over by guest host Kathie Lee Gifford on November 26, 1982. The entire cast was present, save Jim Backus who was unable to attend. Backus appeared via a live video remote from Los Angeles.\\r\\nAll seven of the original cast members (along with Sherwood Schwartz) reunited on television for one last time on a 1988 episode of The Late Show with Ross Shafer.\\r\\nGilligan's Island: Underneath the Grass Skirt is a 1999 documentary featuring Denver and Louise.\\r\\nE!

Television (under Turner Entertainment Co., which in 1986 acquired UA's share of the series as part of the classic Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer library). It has aired on TBS from 1990 to 2003, where it also aired with colorization on season one for a while. TNT aired it at some point in the 1990s, and also aired the colorized season one. Nick at Nite later aired the series from 2000 to 2001. It then shifted to TV Land, where it aired from 2001 to 2003 (and again from January to June 2014). Then, in 2004, it aired on Hallmark Channel.\\r\\nAs of 2015, the show aired nationally on both TV Land and MeTV.[1]\\r\\nWarner Home Video released all three seasons of Gilligan's Island on DVD in Region 1 between 2004 and 2005. The Complete First Season features all 36 episodes unedited with the original theme song. And, unlike other releases of older sitcoms, the episodes are in their original black-and-white format. The special features include the rare pilot episode with commentary with creator Sherwood Schwartz, and three other featurettes.\\r\\nThe Complete Second Season includes all 32 season-two episodes and mentions in an interesting way that this season is in color. Bonuses for this set include: a season-two introduction with Russell Johnson and Sherwood Schwartz and audio commentary on the season's third episode, \\"The Little Dictator\\".\\r\\nThe Complete Third Season includes all 30 season-three episodes and uses words from the theme song on the back: \\"Just sit right back... for the final season!\\" Special features include a season introduction with Russell Johnson and Sherwood Schwartz, commentary on the season's fourth episode, \\"The Producer\\", guest-starring Phil Silvers, and a 15-minute documentary entitled Gilligan's Island: A Pop Culture Phenomenon.\\r\\nThe Complete Series Collection contains all the same bonuses and featurettes, no added features for a complete series box set. All these releases were double-sided discs (which require flipping disc over), and came in boxed sets, containing three discs per season.\\r\\nIn April 2012, the series was reissued in new DVD releases, with six episodes per disc and six discs per season, except for season 3, which only has five.\\r\\nIn August 2006, an executive at Warner Bros. announced plans that Gilligan's Island, in addition to other classic TV series owned by the studio, would be re-mastered in HD.[29] The original TV series was shot on high resolution film, but scaled down for broadcast.\\r\\nOn January 20, 2014, TV Land became the first network to air HD remastered episodes of Gilligan's Island. This marked the first time the WB remastered episodes were seen by fans and the general public.[30]\\r\\nAt present, a release on Blu-ray or other physical media has not yet been announced. However the HD remastered episodes of Gilligan's Island are currently available for purchase through streaming media sources, such as Amazon Video and the iTunes Store.\\r\\nA video game based on the series called The Adventures of Gilligan's Island was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in July 1990. The game features the likenesses of all the original castaways except for Ginger, who is completely absent from the game.\\r\\nA pinball machine, manufactured by BALLY, based on the show was released in May 1991.\\r\\nRights to the series were purchased, with an eye towards creating a movie scheduled for release March 30, 2012.[31] When Sherwood Schwartz signed a deal granting all rights to the movie, he reportedly said, \\"[It] just happened in the last 48 hours. I cant take this much excitement at my age.\\" Schwartz also said he would love to see Michael Cera as Gilligan and Beyonc Knowles as Ginger.[32]\\r\\nOn December 17, 2013, deadline.com reported that Josh Gad would star and co-write the film with Benji Samit and Dan Hernandez.[33]\\r\\nThe question of which of these two characters men prefer has endured long after the end of the series.[34][35] The question has inspired commercials,[36] essays, videos, and a sermon.[37] By most accounts, the wholesome, down-to-earth Mary Ann has consistently outpolled the glamorous bombshell movie-star Ginger by a sizable margin.[38] Bob Denver admitted he was a Mary Ann fan.[35] According to Bob Denver in a 2001 interview, Wells received 3,000ÿ5,000 fan letters weekly, whereas Louise may have gotten 1,500 or 2,000.[39][40]","input":"Who sang the original gilligan island theme song?"},{"output":"It is sweet and proper to die for the fatherland","context":"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori is a line from the Roman lyrical poet Horace's Odes (III.2.13).

It requires that developers charging for apps and downloads through Google Play must use Google Play's payment system. In-app purchases unlocking additional app functionality must also use the Google Play payment system, except in cases where the purchase \\"is solely for physical products\\" or \\"is for digital content that may be consumed outside of the app itself (e.g. songs that can be played on other music players).\\"[74] Support for paid applications was introduced on February 13, 2009 for developers in the United States and the United Kingdom,[75] with support expanded to an additional 29 countries on September 30, 2010.[76] The in-app billing system was originally introduced in March 2011.[77] All developers on Google Play are required to feature a physical address on the app's page in Google Play, a requirement established in September 2014.[78]\\r\\nIn February 2017, Google announced that it would let developers set sales for their apps, with the original price striked out and a banner underneath informing users when the sale ends. Google also announced that it had made changes to its algorithms to promote games based on user engagement and not just downloads. Finally, it announced new editorial pages for what it considers \\"optimal gaming experiences on Android\\", further promoting and curating games.[8][9][10]\\r\\nGoogle allows users to purchase content with credit or debit cards, carrier billing, gift cards, or through PayPal.[79] Google began rolling out carrier billing for purchases in May 2012,[14][80] followed by support for PayPal in May 2014.[81][82]\\r\\nThe rumor of Google Play gift cards started circulating online in August 2012 after references to it was discovered by Android Police in the 3.8.15 version update of the Play Store Android app.[83] Soon after, images of the gift cards started to leak,[84] and on August 21, 2012 they were made official by Google and rolled out over the next few weeks.[85][86]\\r\\nGoogle Play gift cards are currently available in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.[87]\\r\\nGoogle introduced in-app subscriptions to Google Play in May 2012.[88][89] In June 2016, Google announced that subscriptions charged through Google Play would now split the revenue 85/15, where developers receive 85% of revenue and Google only takes 15%, a change from the traditional 70/30 split in years prior. The move followed Apple's then-recently announced change of the same model, although commentators were quick to point out that while Apple only grants the 85/15 revenue share after one year of active subscriptions, Google's subscription change takes effect immediately.[90][91][92]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlay Store is Google's official pre-installed app store on Android-certified devices. It provides access to content on the Google Play Store, including apps, books, magazines, music, movies, and television programs.[96]\\r\\nPlay Store filters the list of apps to those compatible with the user's device. Developers can target specific hardware components (such as compass), software components (such as widget), and Android versions (such as 7.0 Nougat).[97] Carriers can also ban certain apps from being installed on users' devices, for example tethering applications.[98]\\r\\nThere is no requirement that Android applications must be acquired using the Play Store. Users may download Android applications from a developer's website or through a third-party app store alternative.[99] Play Store applications are self-contained Android Package files (APK), similar to .exe files to install programs on Microsoft Windows computers.[100] On Android devices, an \\"Unknown sources\\" feature in Settings allows users to bypass the Play Store and install APKs from other sources.[101] Depending on developer preferences, some apps can be installed to a phone's external storage card.[102]\\r\\nThe Play Store app features a history of all installed apps. Users can remove apps from the list, with the changes also synchronizing to the Google Play website interface, where the option to remove apps from the history does not exist.[103]\\r\\nGoogle publishes the source code for Android through its \\"Android Open Source Project\\", allowing enthusiasts and developers to program and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system. However, not all these modified versions are compatible with apps developed for Google's official Android versions. The \\"Android Compatibility Program\\" serves to \\"define a baseline implementation of Android that is compatible with third-party apps written by developers\\". Only Android devices that comply with Google's compatibility requirements may install and access Google's Play Store application. As stated in a help page for the Android Open Source Project, \\"Devices that are \\"Android compatible\\" may participate in the Android ecosystem, including Android Market; devices that don't meet the compatibility requirements exist outside that ecosystem. In other words, the Android Compatibility Program is how we separate \\"Android compatible devices\\" from devices that merely run derivatives of the source code. We welcome all uses of the Android source code, but only Android compatible devicesas defined and tested by the Android Compatibility Programmay participate in the Android ecosystem.\\"[104]\\r\\nSome device manufacturers choose to use their own app store instead of - or in addition to - the Play Store. Examples include Amazon opting for Amazon Appstore instead of Google Play for its Kindle Fire tablet computers,[105] and Samsung adding Galaxy Apps for its line of Samsung Galaxy smartphones and tablets.[106]\\r\\nIn 2012, Google began decoupling certain aspects of its Android operating system (particularly its core applications) so they could be updated through the Google Play store independently of the OS. One of those components, Google Play Services, is a closed-source system-level process providing APIs for Google services, installed automatically on nearly all devices running Android 2.2 \\"Froyo\\" and higher. With these changes, Google can add new system functionality through Play Services and update apps without having to distribute an upgrade to the operating system itself.[107] As a result, Android 4.2 and 4.3 \\"Jelly Bean\\" contained relatively fewer user-facing changes, focusing more on minor changes and platform improvements.[108]\\r\\nIn April 2016, Google announced the Google Play Awards, described as \\"a way to recognize our incredible developer community and highlight some of the best apps and games\\". The awards showcase five nominees across ten award categories, and the apps are featured in a dedicated section of Google Play. Google stated that \\"Nominees were selected by a panel of experts on the Google Play team based on criteria emphasizing app quality, innovation, and having a launch or major update in the last 12 months\\", with the winners announced in May.[129][130]\\r\\nGoogle has also previously released yearly lists of apps it deemed the \\"best\\" on Google Play.[131][132]\\r\\nOn March 6, 2017, five years after Google Play's launch, Google released lists of the best-selling apps, games, movies, music, and books over the past five years.[133][134]\\r\\nIn June 2017, Google introduced \\"Android Excellence\\", a new editorial program to highlight the apps deemed the highest quality by the Google Play editors.[135][136]\\r\\nGoogle places some restrictions on the types of apps that can be published, in particular not allowing sexually explicit content, child endangerment, violence, bullying & harassment, hate speech, gambling, illegal activities, and requiring precautions for user-generated content.[137]\\r\\nIn March 2015, Google disclosed that over the past few months, it had been begun using a combination of automated tools and human reviewers to check apps for malware and terms of service violations before they are published in the Play Store. At the same time, it began rolling out a new age-based ratings system for apps and games, based on a given region's official ratings authority (for example, ESRB in the US).[138][139][140]\\r\\nIn October 2016, Google announced a new detection and filtering system designed to provide \\"additional enhancements to protect the integrity of the store\\". The new system is aimed to detect and filter cases where developers have been attempting to \\"manipulate the placement of their apps through illegitimate means like fraudulent installs, fake reviews, and incentivized ratings\\".[141][142][143]\\r\\nSome mobile carriers can block users from installing certain apps. In March 2009, reports surfaced that several tethering apps were banned from the store.[144] However, the apps were later restored, with a new ban preventing only T-Mobile subscribers from downloading the apps. Google released a statement:[145]\\r\\nWe inadvertently unpublished the applications for all carriers, and today we have corrected the problem so that all Android Market users outside the T-Mobile US network will now have access to the applications. We have notified the affected developers.\\r\\nIn April 2011, Google removed the Grooveshark app from the store due to unspecified policy violations. CNET noted that the removal came \\"after some of the top music labels have accused the service of violating copyright law\\".[146] TechCrunch wrote approximately two weeks later that Grooveshark had returned to Android, \\"albeit not through the official App Market\\", but rather \\"Playing on Android's ability to install third-party applications through the browser, Grooveshark has taken on the responsibility of distributing the application themselves\\".[147]\\r\\nIn May 2011, Google banned the account of the developer of several video game emulators. Neither Google nor the developer publicly revealed the reason for the ban.[148]\\r\\nIn March 2013, Google began to pull ad blocking apps from the Play Store, per section 4.4 of the developers' agreement, which prohibits apps that interfere with servers and services.[149]\\r\\nIn February 2012, Google introduced a new automated antivirus system, called Google Bouncer, to scan both new and existing apps for malware, spyware, and trojan viruses.[150][151] In 2017, the Bouncer feature and other safety measures within the Android platform were rebranded under the umbrella name Google Play Protect, a system that regularly scans apps for threats.[152][153]\\r\\nAndroid apps can ask for or require certain permissions on the device, including access to body sensors, calendar, camera, contacts, location, microphone, phone, SMS, and storage.[154]\\r\\nIn July 2017, Google described a new security effort called \\"peer grouping\\", in which apps performing similar functionalities, such as calculator apps, are grouped together and attributes compared. If one app stands out, such as requesting more device permissions than others in the same group, Google's systems automatically flag the app and security engineers take a closer inspection. Peer grouping is based on app descriptions, metadata, and statistics such as download count.[155][156]\\r\\nIn early March 2011, DroidDream, a trojan rootkit exploit, was released to then-named Android Market in the form of several free applications that were, in many cases, pirated versions of existing priced apps. This exploit allowed hackers to steal information such as IMEI and IMSI numbers, phone model, user ID, and service provider. The exploit also installed a backdoor that allowed the hackers to download more code to the infected device.[157] The exploit only affected devices running Android versions earlier than 2.3 \\"Gingerbread\\".[158] Google removed the apps from the Market immediately after being alerted,[159] but the apps had already been downloaded more than 50,000 times, according to Android Police's estimate.[157] Android Police wrote that the only method of removing the exploit from an infected device was to reset it to factory state, although community-developed solutions for blocking some aspects of the exploit were created.[159] A few days later, Google confirmed that 58 malicious apps had been uploaded to Android Market, and had been downloaded to 260,000 devices before being removed from the store.[160] Google emailed affected users with information that \\"As far as we can determine, the only information obtained was device-specific (IMEI/IMSI, unique codes which are used to identify mobile devices, and the version of Android running on your device)\\" as opposed to personal data and account information.[160] It also announced a new \\"remote kill\\" functionality, alongside a security update, that lets Google remotely remove malicious apps from users' devices.[160] However, days later, a malicious version of the security update was found on the Internet, though it did not contain the specific DroidDream malware.[161] New apps featuring the malware, renamed DroidDream Light, surfaced the following June, and were also removed from the store.[162]\\r\\nAt the Black Hat security conference in 2012, security firm Trustwave demonstrated their ability to upload an app that would circumvent the Bouncer blocker system. The application used a JavaScript exploit to steal contacts, SMS messages, and photos, and was also capable of making the phone open arbitrary web pages or launch denial-of-service attacks. Nicholas Percoco, senior vice president of Trustwave's SpiderLabs advanced security team, stated that \\"We wanted to test the bounds of what it's capable of\\". The app stayed on Google Play for more than two weeks, being repeatedly scanned by the Bouncer system without detection, with Percoco further saying that \\"As an attack, all a malware attacker has to do to get into Google Play is to bypass Bouncer\\". Trustwave reached out to Google to share their findings, but noted that more manual testing of apps might be necessary to detect apps using malware-masking techniques.[163][164]\\r\\nAccording to a 2014 research study released by RiskIQ, a security services company, malicious apps introduced through Google Play increased 388% between 2011 and 2013, while the number of apps removed by Google dropped from 60% in 2011 to 23% in 2013. The study further revealed that \\"Apps for personalizing Android phones led all categories as most likely to be malicious\\".[165][166] According to PC World, \\"Google said it would need more information about RiskIQ's analysis to comment on the findings.\\"[167]\\r\\nIn October 2016, Engadget reported about a blog post named \\"Password Storage in Sensitive Apps\\" from freelance Android hacker Jon Sawyer, who decided to test the top privacy apps on Google Play. Testing two applications, one named \\"Hide Pictures Keep Safe Vault\\" and the other named \\"Private Photo Vault\\", Sawyer found significant errors in password handling in both, and commented, \\"These companies are selling products that claim to securely store your most intimate pieces of data, yet are at most snake oil. You would have near equal protection just by changing the file extension and renaming the photos.\\"[168][169]\\r\\nIn April 2017, security firm Check Point announced that a malware named \\"FalseGuide\\" had been hidden inside approximately 40 \\"game guide\\" apps in Google Play.[170] The malware is capable of gaining administrator access to infected devices, where it then receives additional modules that let it show popup ads. The malware, a type of botnet, is also capable of launching DDoS attacks.[171][170] After being alerted to the malware, Google removed all instances of it in the store,[171] but by that time, approximately two million Android users had already downloaded the apps, the oldest of which had been around since November 2016.[170]\\r\\nIn June 2017, researchers from Sophos security company announced their finding of 47 apps using a third-party development library that shows intrusive advertisements on users' phones. Even after such apps are force-closed by the user, advertisements remain. Google removed some of the apps after receiving reports from Sophos, but some apps remained. When asked for a comment by Ars Technica, Google didn't respond.[172]\\r\\nIn August 2017, 500 apps were removed from Google Play after security firm Lookout discovered that the apps contained an SDK that allowed for malicious advertising. The apps had been collectively downloaded over 100 million times, and consisted of a wide variety of use cases, including health, weather, photo-editing, Internet radio and emoji.[173][174]\\r\\nSome developers publishing on Google Play have been sued for patent infringement by \\"patent trolls\\", people who own broad or vaguely worded patents that they use to target small developers. If the developer manages to successfully challenge the initial assertion, the \\"patent troll\\" changes the claim of the violation in order to accuse the developer of having violated a different assertion in the patent. This situation continues until the case goes into the legal system, which can have substantial economic costs, prompting some developers to settle.[175] In February 2013, Austin Meyer, a flight simulator game developer, was sued for having used a copy-protection system in his app, a system that he said \\"Google gave us! And, of course, this is what Google provides to everyone else that is making a game for Android!\\" Meyer claimed that Google would not assist in the lawsuit, and he stated that he would not settle the case.[176] His battle with the troll continued for several years, uploading a video in June 2016 discussing that he was then being sued for uploading his app to Google Play, because \\"the patent troll apparently owns the idea [sic] of the Google Play Store itself\\".[175] Android Authority wrote that \\"This scenario has played out against many other app developers for many years\\", and have prompted discussions over \\"a larger issue at stake\\", in which developers stop making apps out of fear of patent problems.[175]\\r\\nUsers outside the countries/regions listed below only have access to free apps and games through Google Play.","input":"How many apps are in the google play store?"},{"output":"October 3, 2000","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin Orzechowski (September 8, 1947 ÿ October 3, 2000), known professionally as Benjamin  Orr, was an American musician best known as a singer, bassist and co-founder of the rock band the Cars.

He also scored a moderate solo hit with \\"Stay the Night.\\" Orr was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Cars in 2018.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin Orr was born  in Lakewood, Ohio[2] to parents of Polish, Russian, Czechoslovakian and German descent. His family actively supported his musical endeavors. He became proficient in several instruments including the guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, and drums.  Known locally as \\"Benny 11-Letters,\\" he grew up in Lakewood, Ohio, and Parma, Ohio, and attended Valley Forge High School before joining a local band the Grasshoppers as lead singer and guitarist in 1964.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965, the Grasshoppers released two singles on the Sunburst label, \\"Mod Socks\\" and \\"Pink Champagne (and Red Roses)\\", the latter written by Orzechowski. The Grasshoppers were also the house band on the Big 5 Show, a musical variety TV show produced by WEWS-TV in Cleveland. The Grasshoppers dissolved in 1966 when two of the band members were drafted into the U.S. Army, after which Orzechowski joined the band Mixed Emotions and later, the Colours. Later Orzechowski was drafted as well, although he received a deferment after approximately a year and a half in the Army.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrr first met Ric Ocasek, the future leader of the Cars, in Cleveland in the 1960s after Ocasek saw Orr performing with the Grasshoppers on the Big 5 Show.[6] A few years later, Orr moved to Columbus, Ohio where he and Ocasek formed a musical partnership that would continue in various incarnations until the break-up of the Cars in 1988. After moving to Boston, the two formed a folk band called Milkwood with guitarist James Goodkind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1973, the group released one album, How's the Weather?, which failed to chart. Remaining in Boston, Ocasek and Orr then formed another band, Richard and the Rabbits, featuring keyboardist Greg Hawkes, followed by another band, Cap'n Swing, which included guitarist Elliot Easton. After the group broke up in 1976, the three of them along with Hawkes and drummer David Robinson formed the Cars.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a member of the Cars, Orr sang lead vocal on some of the band's best known songs, including their first top 40 hit \\"Just What I Needed\\", \\"Let's Go,\\" and on \\"Drive\\", their highest-charting U.S. single.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrr released his only solo album, The Lace, in 1986.  He co-wrote the music and lyrics with his long-time girlfriend, Diane Grey Page who also sang backing vocals,[7] and the album had one top 40 hit, \\"Stay the Night\\". The song was a top 10 album rock hit[8] and the video was in heavy rotation on MTV.[9] A second single \\"Too Hot to Stop\\" was also released, but did not chart in the Billboard Hot 100 though it reached number #25 in the rock charts. The album cover for The Lace featured Orr on the front and Page on the back.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrr continued to work with the Cars for one more album, Door to Door, and tour before the group disbanded in 1988, after which he and the other members pursued solo work. Sometime in the mid-1990s, Orr recorded tracks with guitarist John Kalishes for an unreleased follow-up to The Lace. From 1998 until his death in 2000, he performed with his own band ORR and two side bands, \\"The Voices of Classic Rock\\" with Mickey Thomas and John Cafferty,[10][11]\\r\\nand \\"Big People\\",[2] which was a cover band with Pat Travers (of the Pat Travers Band), Jeff Carlisi (of 38 Special), Derek St. Holmes (of Ted Nugent), and Liberty DeVitto (of Billy Joel).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2000 Orr was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and hospitalized,[12]; however, he continued to perform with the band Big People throughout that summer at music festivals and state fairs.

Very small businesses employ between 6 and 20 employees, small businesses employ between 21 and 50 employees. The upper limit for turnover in a small business varies from R1 million in the Agricultural sector to R13 million in the Catering, Accommodations and other Trade sector as well as in the Manufacturing sector, with a maximum of R32 million in the Wholesale Trade sector.\\r\\nMedium-sized businesses usually employ up to 200 people (100 in the Agricultural sector), and the maximum turnover varies from R5 million in the Agricultural sector to R51 million in the Manufacturing sector and R64 million in the Wholesale Trade, Commercial Agents and Allied Services sector.\\r\\nA comprehensive definition of an SME in South Africa is therefore any enterprise with one or more of the following characteristics:\\r\\nUnder section 7 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006, the Indian government defined the size of micro, small, and medium enterprises as:[5]\\r\\n(i) a micro enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery does not exceed twenty-five lakh rupees\\r\\n(ii) a small enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery is more than twenty-five lakh rupees but does not exceed five crore rupees; or\\r\\n(iii) a medium enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery is more than five crore rupees but does not exceed ten crore rupees;\\r\\n(b) in the case of the enterprises engaged in providing or rendering of services, as\\r\\n(i) a micro enterprise, where the investment in equipment does not exceed ten lakh rupees;\\r\\n(ii) a small enterprise, where the investment in equipment is more than ten lakh rupees but does not exceed two crore rupees; or\\r\\nBusinesses that are declared as MSMEs and within specific sectors and criteria can then apply for \\"priority sector\\" lending to help with business expenses; banks have annual targets set by the Prime Ministers Task Force on MSMEs for year-on-year increases of lending to various categories of MSMEs.[6]\\r\\nIn Indonesia, the government defines micro, small, and medium enterprises (Indonesian: Usaha Mikro Kecil dan Menengah, UMKM) based on their assets and revenues according to Law No. 20/2008:[7]\\r\\nAn annual revenue of Rp 50 billion is approximately equal to USD 3.7 million as of November 2017.\\r\\nIn Bangladesh, Bangladesh Bank defines Small and medium enterprises based on Fixed Asset and Employed Manpower and they are definitely not Public Limited Co. and requires these characteristics -\\r\\nSE (Small Enterprises) & ME (Medium Enterprises)\\r\\n(not above)\\r\\nFor ME 50,00,000 - 10,00,00,000\\r\\nFor ME 50,00,000 - 10,00,00,000\\r\\nFor Me 1,50,00,000 - 2,00,00,000\\r\\nWith effect from 1 April 2011, the definition of SMEs is businesses with annual sales turnover of not more than $100 million or employing no more than 200 staff. [8]\\r\\nThe criteria for defining the size of a business differ from country to country, with many countries having programs of business rate reduction and financial subsidy for SMEs. According to the European Commission,[9] the SME are the enterprises that meet the following definition of staff headcount and either the turnover or balance sheet total definitions:\\r\\nIn July 2011, the European Commission said it would open a consultation on the definition of SMEs in 2012. In Europe, there are three broad parameters which define SMEs:\\r\\nThe European definition of SME follows: \\"The category of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is made up of enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding 50 million euro, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 43 million euro.\\"[11] In order to prepare for an evaluation and revision of some features of the small and medium-sized enterprises definition European Union established public consultation period from 6 February 2018 to 6 May 2018. Public consultation is available for all EU member country citizens and organizations. Especially, national and regional authorities, enterprises, business associations or organizations, venture capital providers, research and academic institutions, and individual citizens are expected as the main contributors. [12]\\r\\nEU member states have had individual definitions of what constitutes an SME. For example, the definition in Germany had a limit of 255 employees, while in Belgium it could have been 100. The result is that while a Belgian business of 249 employees would be taxed at full rate in Belgium, it would nevertheless be eligible for SME subsidy under a European-labelled programme.\\r\\nSMEs are a crucial element in the supplier network of large enterprises which are already on their way towards Industry 4.0.[13] According to German economist Hans-Heinrich Bass, \\"empirical research on SME as well as policies to promote SME have a long tradition in [West] Germany, dating back into the 19th century. Until the mid-20th century most researchers considered SME as an impediment to further economic development and SME policies were thus designed in the framework of social policies. Only the Ordoliberalism school, the founding fathers of Germany's social market economy, discovered their strengths, considered SME as a solution to mid-20th century economic problems (mass unemployment, abuse of economic power), and laid the foundations for non-selective (functional) industrial policies to promote SMEs.\\"[14]\\r\\nThe SME sector in Poland generates almost 50% of the GDP, and out of that, for instance, in 2011, micro companies generated 29.6%, small companies 7.7%, and medium companies 10.4% (big companies 24.0%; other entities 16.5%, and revenues from customs duties and taxes generated 11.9%). In 2011, out of the total of 1,784,603 entities operating in Poland, merely 3,189 were classified as \\"large\\", so 1,781,414 were micro, small, or medium.

In Poland in 2011 was 36.2 SMEs per 1,000 of inhabitants.[15]\\r\\nIn the UK a company is defined as being an SME if it meets two out of three criteria: it has a turnover of less than S25m, it has fewer than 250 employees, it has gross assets of less than S12.5m.[16] Many small and medium-sized businesses form part of the UK's currently growing Mittelstand, or Brittelstand as it is also often named.[17] These are businesses in Britain that are not only small or medium but also have a much broader set of values and more elastic definition.\\r\\nThe Department for Business Innovation and Skills estimated that at the start of 2014, 99.3% of UK private sector businesses were SMEs, with their S1.6 trillion annual turnover accounting for 47% of private sector turnover.[18][19]\\r\\nIn order to support SMEs, the UK government set a target in 2010 \\"that 25% of governments spend, either directly or in supply chains, goes to SMEs by 2015\\"; it achieved this by 2013.[20]\\r\\nIn Switzerland, the Federal Statistical Office defines small and medium-sized enterprises as companies with less than 250 employees.[21] The categories are the following:[21]\\r\\nIndustry Canada defines a small business as one with fewer than 100 paid employees and a medium-sized business as one with at least 100 and fewer than 500 employees. As of December 2012, there were 1,107,540 employer businesses in Canada, of which 1,087,803 were small. Small businesses make up 98.2 percent of employer businesses, medium-sized businesses make up 1.6 percent of employer businesses and large businesses make up 0.1 percent of employer businesses. In 2012, over 7.7 million employees, or 69.7 percent of the total private labour force, worked for small businesses and 2.2 million employees, or 20.2 percent of the labour force, worked for medium-sized businesses. In total, SMEs employed about 10 million individuals, or 89.9 percent of employees. Canadian high-growth firms are present in every economic sector and are not just concentrated in knowledge-based industries. In terms of employment, the highest concentrations of high-growth firms in Canada during the 2006ÿ2009 period were in construction (4.9 percent of all firms); business, building and other support services (4.6 percent); and professional, scientific and technical services (4.5 percent). In 2011, only 10.4 percent of SMEs exported. Nonetheless, they were responsible for $150 billion, or about 41.0 percent, of Canada's total value of exports.[22]\\r\\nCorporations in Canada are generally taxed at 29% federally. Canadian Controlled private corporations receive a 17% reduction in the tax rate on taxable income from active businesses up to $500,000. This small business deduction is reduced for corporations whose taxable capital exceeding $10M, and is completely eliminated for corporations whose taxable capital exceeds $15M.[23] It has been estimated that almost $2 trillion of Canadian SMEs will be coming up for sale over the next decade which is twice as large as the assets of the top 1,000 Canadian pension plans and approximately the same size as Canadian annual GDP.[24]\\r\\nThe small and medium sized companies in Mexico are called PyMEs, which is a direct translation of SMEs. But there's another categorization in the country calledl MiPyMEs. The MiPyMEs are micro, small and medium sized businesses, with an emphasis on micro which are one man companies or a type of freelance.\\r\\nIn the United States, the Small Business Administration sets small business criteria based on industry, ownership structure, revenue and number of employees (which in some circumstances may be as high as 1500, although the cap is typically 500).[25] Both the US and the EU generally use the same threshold of fewer than 10 employees for small offices (SOHO).[citation needed]\\r\\nAlso in the United States small and medium-sized manufacturers are referred to as SMM's [26] which the U.S. Department of Energy classifies as having gross annual sales below $100 million, Fewer than 500 employees at the plant site, and annual energy bills more than $100,000 but less than $2.5 million.[27]\\r\\nIn Australia, a SME has 200 or fewer employees. Microbusinesses have 1ÿ4 employees, small businesses 5ÿ19, medium businesses 20ÿ199, and large businesses 200+.[28] Australian SMEs make up 97% of all Australian businesses, produced one third of total GDP, and employ 4.7 million people. SMEs represent 90 per cent of all goods exporters and over 60% of services exporters.[29]\\r\\nIn New Zealand, 99% of businesses employ 50 or less staff, and the official definition of a small business is one with 19 or fewer employees.[30][31]","input":"How many employees is a medium sized company?"},{"output":"Monmouth","context":"Avon-by-the-Sea (often called simply Avon) is a borough in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States, As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 1,901,[8][9][10] reflecting a decline of 343 (-15.3%) from the 2,244 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 79 (+3.6%) from the 2,165 counted in the 1990 Census.[19] The borough's name is pronounced \\"Ah-von\\" (not \\"Ay-von\\").[20][21]\\r\\nAvon-by-the-Sea was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 23, 1900, from portions of Neptune City.[22] The borough was named for Avon, England.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 0.541 square mile (1.403?km2), including 0.426 square mile (1.104?km2) of land and 0.115 square mile (0.298?km2) of water (21.27%).[1][2]\\r\\nThe borough borders the Monmouth County communities of Belmar, Bradley Beach, Neptune City and Neptune Township.[25]\\r\\nAvon-by-the-Sea is located on the Atlantic Ocean and is surrounded by two other bodies of water.

Its main building is the Ted Weiss Federal Building at 290 Broadway.[5] The site contains the remains of more than 419 Africans buried during the late 17th and 18th centuries in a portion of what was the largest colonial-era cemetery for people of African descent, some free, most enslaved.[6] Historians estimate there may have been 10,000[7]ÿ20,000 burials in what was called the \\"Negroes Burial Ground\\" in the 1700s. The five to six acre site's excavation and study was called \\"the most important historic urban archeological project in the United States.\\"[8] The Burial Ground site is New York's earliest known African-American \\"cemetery\\"; studies show an estimated 15,000 African American people were buried here.[9]\\r\\nThe discovery highlighted the forgotten history of African slaves in colonial and federal New York City, who were integral to its development. By the American Revolutionary War, they constituted nearly a quarter of the population in the city. New York had the second-largest number of slaves in the nation after Charleston, South Carolina. Scholars and African-American civic activists joined to publicize the importance of the site and lobby for its preservation. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993 and a National Monument in 2006.\\r\\nIn 2003 Congress appropriated funds for a memorial at the site and directed redesign of the federal courthouse to allow for this. A design competition attracted more than 60 proposals for a design. The memorial was dedicated in 2007 to commemorate the role of Africans and African Americans in colonial and federal New York City, and in United States history. Several pieces of public art were also commissioned for the site. A visitor center opened in 2010 to provide interpretation of the site and African-American history in New York.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSlavery in the New York City area was introduced by the Dutch West India Company in New Netherland about 1626 with the arrival of Paul D'Angola, Simon Congo, Lewis Guinea, Jan Guinea, Ascento Angola, and six other mentheir names denote their place of origin: Angola, the Congo, and Guinea. Two years after their arrival three female Angolan slaves arrived. These two groups heralded the beginning of the institution of slavery in what would become New York City that would continue for two hundred years.[10] The first slave auction in the city took place in 1655 at Pearl Street and Wall Street-then on the East River. Although the Dutch imported Africans as slaves, it was possible for some to gain freedom or \\"half-freedom\\" under Dutch rule. Paul D'Angola and his companions petitioned the Dutch West India Company for their freedom in 1643. Their petition was granted and they were given grants of land on which to build their own houses and farm. In the mid-17th century, farms of free blacks covered 130 acres where Washington Square Park later developed.[11] Even slaves in full bondage were granted certain rights and afforded protections such as the prohibition against arbitrary physical punishment?ÿ such as a whipping.\\r\\nAfter the English took over New Amsterdam in 1664, they changed the name to New York (after the Duke of York) and changed the rules governing slavery in the colony. Some 40 percent of the small population was in bondage.[13] The new slavery rules were more harsh and restrictive than those of the Dutch, and rescinded many of the former rights and protections of slaves?ÿ such as the prohibition against random physical punishment. In 1697 Trinity Church gained control of the burial grounds in the city and passed an ordinance excluding Africans from being buried in churchyards. When Trinity took control of the municipal burial ground, now its north graveyard, it barred Africans from interment within the bounds of the city.[13] Through much of the 18th century, the African burying ground was beyond the northern boundary of the city, which was just beyond what is today Chambers Street.\\r\\nAs the city population increased, so did the number of residents who held slaves. \\"In 1703, 42 percent of New York's households had slaves, much more than Philadelphia and Boston combined.\\"[14] Most slaveholding households had only a few slaves, used primarily for domestic work. By the 1740s, 20 percent of the population of New York were slaves,[15] totaling about 2500 people.[11] Slaves also worked as skilled artisans and craftsmen associated with shipping, construction, and other trades, as well as laborers. \\"On the eve of the American Revolution, New York City had the largest number of enslaved Africans of any English colonial settlement except Charleston, South Carolina, and it had the highest proportion of slaves to Europeans of any northern settlement.\\"[13] Africans had become essential to the development of New York.\\r\\nDuring the Revolutionary War, the British occupied New York City in the summer of 1776 and they kept control until after the war ended and they departed on Evacuation Day: November 25, 1783. As in the other rebellious American colonies, the British had offered freedom to slaves who left rebel masters; this was done in part to cause economic damage to the rebel Americans. These individuals were listed in the Book of Negroes. This promise of freedom attracted thousands of slaves to the city who escaped to British lines. In 1781 the New York legislature offered a financial incentive to slaveholders who assigned their slaves to military service, and promised freedom at war's end for the slaves.\\r\\nBy 1780 the African and African-descendant community swelled to about 10,000 in British-occupied New York City, which became the center of free blacks in North America.[15] Among those who escaped to New York were Deborah Squash and her husband Harvey, who fled from George Washington's plantation in Virginia.[15] After the end of the war, according to provisions concerning property in the Treaty of Paris, the Americans demanded the return of all former slaves under British control. The British refused the American request and evacuated 3,000 freedmen with their troops in 1783 for resettlement in Nova Scotia, other British colonies, and England.[15] Other freedmen scattered from the city to evade slave catchers.\\r\\nAided by individual manumissions after war's end, by 1790 about one-third of the blacks in the city were free.[11] The total city population was 33,131, according to the first national census.[16]\\r\\nIn 1799 the state legislature passed \\"An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery\\" with little opposition. Similar to Pennsylvania's law, it provided for gradual manumission of slaves. Children born to slave mothers after July 4, 1799, were considered legally free, but had to serve as indentured servants to their mother's master, until age 28 for men and 25 for women, before gaining social freedom. Until reaching age 21, they were considered the property of the mother's master. All slaves already in bondage before July 4, 1799, remained slaves for life, although they were reclassified as \\"indentured servants.\\"[14][15][17]\\r\\nIn 1817, the New York legislature granted freedom to all children born to slaves after July 4, 1799, with total abolition of slavery to take effect on July 4, 1827. On this date, known as Emancipation Day, more than 10,000 slaves were freed in New York State with no financial compensation to their former owners.[18] Blacks paraded in New York City to celebrate.\\r\\nUnder the 1777 New York constitution, all free men had to satisfy a property requirement to vote, which eliminated poorer men from voting, both blacks and whites.[17] A new constitution in 1821 eliminated the property requirement for white men, but kept it for blacks, effectively continuing to disfranchise them. This lasted until passage of the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1870.[17]\\r\\nThe early history of free blacks and slaves in New York City became overshadowed by the waves of mid- to late nineteenth century immigration from Europe, which dramatically expanded the population and added to the ethnic diversity. In addition, most of the ancestors of today's African-American population in the city arrived from the South in the Great Migration of the first half of the twentieth century. In a rapidly changing city, the early colonial and federal history of African Americans was lost.\\r\\nThe burial ground in use for city residents in the late 1600s was located at what is now the north graveyard of Trinity Church. The public burial ground was open to all for a fee, including to enslaved Africans. Some burials of deceased slaves were made just south of the public burial ground to avoid the fee.\\r\\nThe stockade in this area ran northeast from the present-day corner of Broadway and Chambers Street to Foley Square; the wide street on the top right (southwest) is Broadway.\\r\\nAfter Trinity was established in 1697, the vestryman of the church began taking control of land in Lower Manhattan, including existing public burial grounds. When Trinity purchased the land at Wall Street and Broadway for the construction of their church, they passed a resolution on October 25, 1697:\\r\\nThat after the Expiration of four weeks from the dates hereof no Negro's be buried within the bounds & Limitts of the Church Yard of Trinity Church, that is to say, in the rear of the present burying place & that no person or Negro whatsoever, do presume after the terme above Limitted to break up any ground for the burying of his Negro, as they will answer it at their perill & that this order be forthwith publish'd.\\r\\nThe \\"rear of the present burying place\\" did not include the city cemetery (now the north churchyard). The church petitioned for control of this burial ground, which was granted by the colony on April 22, 1703.\\r\\nThis prohibition against the burial of those of African descent necessitated finding another area acceptable to the colonial authorities. What would become the \\"Negro's Burial ground\\" was located on what was then the outskirts of the developed city, just north of present-day Chambers Street and west of the former Collect Pond. The area was part of a land grant issued to Cornelius van Borsum on behalf of his wife Sara Roelofs (1624ÿ1693) for her services as an interpreter between the city and the various Native American tribes in the area, such as the Lenape and Wappinger. The land would remain part of her estate until the late 1790s when the grade was raised with landfill in anticipation of development, and the land subdivided into building lots.\\r\\nLabelled on old maps as the \\"Negros Burial Ground,\\" the 6.6-acre area was first recorded as being used around 1712 for the burials of enslaved and freed people of African descent. The first burials may date from the late 1690s after Trinity barred African burials in the former city cemetery. The burial ground remained in use until 1794.\\r\\nThe area of the burial ground was in a shallow valley surrounded by low hills on the east, south and west, which enveloped the southern shore of the Collect Pond and the Little Collect. The burial ground was outside the stockade marking the northern boundary of the city. The stockade in this area ran northeast from the present-day corner of Broadway and Chambers Street to Foley Square after it had expanded northward, similar in form and function to the former stockade on Wall Street.\\r\\nThe revelation that physicians and medical students were illegally digging up bodies for dissection from this burial ground precipitated the 1788 Doctors' Riot.\\r\\nAfter the city closed the cemetery in 1794, the area was platted for development. The grade of the land was raised with up to 25 feet (7.6 metres) of landfill at the lowest points covering the cemetery, thus preserving the burials and the original grade level. As urban development took place over the fill, the burial ground was largely forgotten. The first large-scale development on the land was the construction of the A.T. Stewart Company Store, the country's first department store; it opened in 1846 at the corner of Broadway and Chambers Street. Several skeletons were unearthed during the commencement of building the store.[20]\\r\\nThe site's earliest discovery in the early 19th century seems to have aroused little interest. According to an article in The New York Tribune, homeowner James Gemmel, who owned a house at 290 Broadway in the early 19th century, told an unnamed daughter that when the cellar for their house was being dug many human bones were found. He assumed that he had discovered a potter's field.[21] In 1897, when the building at 290 Broadway was demolished to make way for the R. G. Dun and Company Building, workers in excavating found a large number of human bones.[22] Some concluded at that time that these were connected to a 1744 incident in which thirteen African Americans were burned at the stake and eighteen were hanged,[21] however others wondered whether the bones were of Dutch or Indian origin.[20][23] Many bones were taken as souvenirs by so-called \\"relic hunters.\\"[20][23]\\r\\nIn October 1991, the General Services Administration (GSA) announced the discovery (or rediscovery) of intact burials during an archeological survey and excavation for the construction of a new $275 million federal office building at 290 Broadway. The agency had done an environmental impact statement (EIS) prior to purchase of the site, but the archeological survey had predicted that human remains would not be found because of the long history of urban development in that area.[13]\\r\\nAfter the discovery of the first intact burials became publicly known, the African-American community became very concerned. With the pressure of construction costs, GSA tried to continue excavation and construction on the site. The community believed it was not being sufficiently consulted and that respect was not being given to the nature of the discoveries. They believed that the burial findings required a better archeological project design for protection and study of the remains.[13]\\r\\nInitially, GSA had planned full archeological retrieval of the remains as full mitigation of the effects of its construction project on the burial ground. Within the year, its teams removed the remains of 420 persons from the site, but it had become clear that the extent of the burial ground was too large to be fully excavated. In 1992, activists staged a protest at the site about GSA's handling of the burial issue, especially when it was found that some intact burials were broken up during construction excavation at part of the site.[13]\\r\\nGSA halted construction until the site could be thoroughly assessed. It provided additional funding to conduct a further archaeological excavation to reveal any other bodies on the site and to assess the remains.[13] Located between City Hall and the federal courts, the site had symbolic value. The \\"invisibility\\" of Black history in New York City partially accounts for the importance of the Foley Square site\\"; activists hoped to find a means there to redress \\"the injustice and the imbalance of the historic record, and to give voice to the silenced ones\\".[13]\\r\\nAlthough archeologists studied the site and the remains for almost a dozen years, critics of the construction project believed GSA's original archeological research design was inadequate, as it did not require a plan for the treatment of uncovered remains.[13] In addition, the African-descendant community in New York City was not consulted in the development of the research design, nor were any archaeologists who had experience studying the African diaspora, although GSA had distributed the EIS to more than 200 state and local agencies and stakeholders, many recommended by the city.[13] In the early stages of the project, national GSA officials and related Congressional committees directed that excavation and construction proceed.[13]\\r\\nOversight of the project increased by stakeholders, such as the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and community activists. After continued protests from a coalition of community members, politicians, and scholars, in 1992 the House Subcommittee on Public Works held budget hearings for GSA in New York, at which it heard testimony from a wide variety of critics of GSA's handling of the project and also heard from the GSA Administrator.[13] Several changes occurred. Control of the burial site was transferred from an archeological firm in the city to the physical anthropologist Michael Blakey and his team at Howard University, a historically black college, for study at the Montague Cobb Biological Anthropology Laboratory. This ensured that African-American students would participate in studies of their ethnic ancestors' remains.[13]\\r\\nIn large part due to activism by the African-American community, which lobbied the US Congress on this project, in October 1992 Congress passed and President George H. W. Bush signed a law to redesign it in order to stop construction of the pavilion portion of the site (where the remains had been found) and to appropriate $3 million for a memorial in that area.[13] The federal building project was redesigned to preserve part of the archeological site for this purpose. The southern portion of the building, slated to be built on the parcel by Duane and Elk Streets, was eliminated to provide adequate room for a memorial.[13]\\r\\nThe burial ground was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, as the extent of the burials made it significant for both regional and national history. Given its importance, GSA proposed partial mitigation of the adverse effects to the burial ground of the construction of 290 Broadway, by undertaking programs of data analysis, curation, and education.[24] In addition, activists lobbied for landmark status for the burial ground, and gathered 100,000 signatures to send to the Department of the Interior. The ground was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993.[13] There was also growing support for a museum on the site to interpret African-American experience and history in New York.\\r\\nThe discovery and long controversy received national media attention, raising interest and awareness in public archeology projects. Theresa Singleton, an archaeologist at the Smithsonian Institution said,\\r\\nThe media exposure has created a larger, national audience for this type of research. I've been called by dozens of scholars and laypeople, all of them interested in African-American archaeology, all of them curious about why they don't know more about the field. Until recently, even some black scholars considered African-American archaeology a waste of time. That's changed now.[13]\\r\\nGovernment and private developers learned about the need to \\"include descendant communities in their salvage excavations, especially when human remains are concerned.\\"[13]\\r\\nThe findings at the burial ground already had highlighted some of the losses of slavery, as African Americans had not been recently recognized as a major part of early New York history until then. As the journalist Edward Rothstein wrote, \\"Among the scars left by the heritage of slavery, one of the greatest is an absence: where are the memorials, cemeteries, architectural structures or sturdy sanctuaries that typically provide the ground for a peoples memory?\\"[11]\\r\\nIn total, the intact remains of more than 400 men, women and children of African descent were found at the site, where they had been buried individually in wooden boxes. There were no mass burials. Nearly half were children under 12, indicating the high mortality rate of the time. Historians and anthropologists estimate that over the decades, as many as 15,000ÿ20,000 Africans were buried in Lower Manhattan. They have determined that this was the largest colonial-era cemetery for enslaved African people. It is also \\"possibly the largest and earliest collection of American colonial remains of any ethnic group.\\"[13] Some of the burials included items related to African origins and burial practices.\\r\\nThe work of excavation and study of the remains was considered the \\"most important historic urban archaeological project undertaken in the United States.\\"[8] These remains stand for the estimated tens of thousands of persons at the burial ground and historically in New York, representing Africans' \\"critical\\" role in \\"the formation and development of this city and, by extension, the Nation.\\"[4] Because of its significance to African-American and United States history, on April 19, 1993, the site was designated a National Historic Landmark by the Department of the Interior.[4][26][27]\\r\\nAs a result of public engagement, the Howard University team identified four questions which the community hoped to have answered from studies of the remains:\\r\\nSome bodies had items buried with them, as part of personal and cultural rituals. An example is the silver pendant shown above. Some heads showed filed teeth, an African ritual decoration. Howard University did forensic studies, assessing the remains for nutrition, diseases and indicators of general living conditions for African slaves and free blacks.\\r\\nAfter the Howard University studies were completed, the remains were reinterred at the site in October 2003 in a ceremony including the \\"Rites of Ancestral Return.\\"[29] The \\"commemorative ceremony was inclusive and international in scope, and was organized by GSA and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture\\" of the New York Public Library.[29] This emotional memorial stretched over multiple cities including Washington D.C, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Newark, and finally Manhattan. Thousands attended the reinterment and commemoration.[29]\\r\\nIn consultation with stakeholders, GSA ran a design competition for the site memorial, which attracted 60 proposals. The winning memorial design by Rodney Leon in partnership with Nicole Hollant-Denis, AARRIS Architects, was chosen in June 2004. The work was completed and dedicated on October 5, 2007.\\r\\nThe memorial design for the 25-foot (7.6?m) granite monument features a map of the Atlantic area within the \\"Circle of Diaspora\\" in reference to the Middle Passage,[30] by which slaves were transported from Africa to North America. It is built of stone from South Africa and from North America, to symbolize the two worlds coming together.[31] The Door of Return, refers to \\"The Door of No Return\\", a name given to slave ports set up for involvement with the age-old local institution of slavery on the coast of West Africa, from which so many people were transported after sale by their native chiefs, never to see their homeland again. The memorial is designed to reconnect ethnic African Americans to their ancestors' origins.[31]\\r\\nOn February 27, 2006, President George W. Bush signed a proclamation designating the burial site as the 123rd National Monument.[32] It was transferred to the operating jurisdiction of the National Park Service as its 390th unit. The NPS runs the visitors center, built in 2010, and arranges for various cultural exhibitions and events at the site throughout the year. The memorial was dedicated in 2007 in a ceremony presided over by Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the poet Maya Angelou.[31] As part of the dedication ceremonies, the city officially renamed Elk Street as African Burial Ground Way.[33]\\r\\nIn February 2010, a visitor center for the African Burial Ground National Monument opened in the Ted Weiss Federal Building at 290 Broadway, which was built over part of the archaeological site.[11] The visitor center includes a permanent exhibit, \\"Reclaiming Our History,\\" on the significance of the burial site. Created by Amaze Design, it features a life-sized tableau by Studio EIS depicting a dual funeral for an adult and child. Other parts of the exhibit explore the work life of Africans in early New York and connection to national history, as well as the late 20th-century community success in preserving the burial ground. The visitor center includes a 40-person theater and a shop.[11]\\r\\nIn addition to earning designation of the site as a National Historic Landmark and National Monument, the discoveries of the African Burial Ground have changed thinking about early African-American history in New York and the nation. Many new books have been published on this topic. In 2005 the New-York Historical Society mounted its first exhibit ever on slavery in New York;[15] the planned six-month run was extended into 2007 because of its popularity.\\r\\nWhen the visitor center at the burial ground opened in 2010, Edward Rothstein wrote,\\r\\nA revision in popular understanding has taken place about slavery's history in New York City, evident in several recent books and an impressive series of shows at the New-York Historical Society. In the 18th century slaves may have constituted a quarter of the New York work force, making this city one of the colonies' largest slave-holding urban centers.[11]","input":"Who was buried at the african burial ground?"},{"output":"El Paso County","context":"Colorado Springs is a home rule municipality that is the largest city by area in Colorado as well as the county seat and the most populous municipality of El Paso County, Colorado, United States. Colorado Springs is located in the east central portion of the state. It is situated on Fountain Creek and is located 60 miles (97?km) south of the Colorado State Capitol in Denver.\\r\\nAt 6,035 feet (1,839?m) the city stands over 1 mile (1.6?km) above sea level. This is higher than Denver, though some areas of the city are significantly higher and lower. Colorado Springs is situated near the base of one of the most famous American mountains, Pikes Peak, rising above 14,000 feet (4,300?m) on the eastern edge of the Southern Rocky Mountains. The city is home to 24 national governing bodies of sport, including the United States Olympic Committee, the United States Olympic Training Center, and USA Hockey.\\r\\nThe city had an estimated population of 465,101 in 2016, and a metro population of approximately 712,000,[11] ranking as the second most populous city in the state of Colorado, behind Denver, and the 40th most populous city in the United States.[12] The Colorado Springs, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area had an estimated population of 712,327 in 2016.[13] The city is included in the Front Range Urban Corridor, an oblong region of urban population along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and Wyoming, generally following the path of Interstate 25 in both states.\\r\\nThe city covers 194.9 square miles (505?km2), making it the most extensive municipality in Colorado.\\r\\nThe Ute, Arapaho and Cheyenne peoples were the first to inhabit the area which would become Colorado Springs.[14] Part of the territory included in the United States' 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the current city area was designated part of the 1854 Kansas Territory. In 1859, after the first local settlement was established, it became part of the Jefferson Territory on October 24 and of El Paso County on November 28. Colorado City at the Front Range confluence of Fountain and Camp creeks was \\"formally organized on August?13, 1859\\"[15] during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. It served as the capital of the Colorado Territory from November 5, 1861, until August 14, 1862, when the capital was moved to Denver.\\r\\nIn 1871 the Colorado Springs Company laid out the towns of La Font (later called Manitou Springs) and Fountain Colony, upstream and downstream respectively, of Colorado City.[16] Within a year, Fountain Colony would be renamed \\"Colorado Springs\\", and was officially incorporated.[17] The El Paso County seat shifted from Colorado City in 1873 to the Town of Colorado Springs.[18] On December 1, 1880, Colorado Springs expanded northward with two annexations.[19] [20]\\r\\nThe second period of annexations was during 1889ÿ90, and included Seavey's Addition, West Colorado Springs, East End, and another North End addition.[19] In 1891 the Broadmoor Land Company built the Broadmoor suburb, which included the Broadmoor Casino, and by December 12, 1895, the city had \\"four Mining Exchanges and 275 mining brokers.\\"[21] By 1898, the city was designated into quadrants by the north-south Cascade Avenue and the east-west Washington/Pike's Peak avenues.[20]:10\\r\\nFrom 1899 to 1901 Tesla Experimental Station operated on Knob Hill,[22] and aircraft flights to the Broadmoor's neighboring fields began in 1919.[23] Alexander Airport north of the city opened in 1925, and in 1927 the original Colorado Springs Municipal Airport land was purchased east of the city.[23]\\r\\nIn World War II the United States Army Air Forces leased land adjacent to the municipal airfield, naming it \\"Peterson Field\\" in December 1942. This was only one of several military presences in and around Colorado Springs during the war.[24][25]\\r\\nIn November 1950, Ent Air Force Base was selected as the Cold War headquarters for Air Defense Command (ADC). The former WWII Army Air Base, Peterson Field, which had been inactivated at the end of the war, was re-opened in 1951 as a U.S. Air Force base.[26] The 1950s through 1970s saw a continued expansion of the military presence in the area, with the establishment of NORAD's headquarters in the city, as well as the ADCOM headquarters.\\r\\nBetween 1965 and 1968, the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, Pikes Peak Community College and Colorado Technical University were established in or near the city.[27][28] In 1977 most of the former Ent AFB became a US Olympic training center. The Libertarian Party was founded within the city in the 1970s.[29]\\r\\nOn October 1, 1981, the Broadmoor Addition,[19] Cheyenne Canon, Ivywild, Skyway, and Stratton Meadows were annexed after the Colorado Supreme Court \\"overturned a district court decision that voided the annexation\\". Further annexations expanding the city include the Nielson Addition and Vineyard Commerce Park Annexation in September 2008. [19]\\r\\nThe city lies in a high desert with the Southern Rocky Mountains to the west, the Palmer Divide to the north, high plains further east, and high desert lands to the south when leaving Fountain and approaching Pueblo.[30]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 194.6 square miles (504.1?km2), of which 194.6 square miles (503.9?km2) is land and 0.35 square miles (0.9?km2), or 0.19%, is water.[31]\\r\\nColorado Springs has many features of a modern urban area, such as parks, bike trails, and urban open-area spaces. However, it is not exempt from problems that typically plague cities that experience tremendous growth, such as overcrowded roads and highways, crime, sprawl, and government budget issues. Many of the problems are indirectly or directly caused by the city's difficulty in coping with the large population growth experienced in the last twenty years, and the annexation of the Banning Lewis Ranch area to accommodate further population growth of 175,000 future residents.[32]\\r\\nColorado Springs has a semi-arid climate (K?ppen BSk), and its location just east of the Rocky Mountains affords it the rapid warming influence from chinook winds during winter but also subjects it to drastic day-to-day variability in weather conditions.[33] The city has abundant sunshine year-round, averaging 243 sunny days per year,[34][35] and receives approximately 16.5 inches (419?mm) of annual precipitation. Due to unusually low precipitation for several years after flooding in 1999, Colorado Springs enacted lawn water restrictions in 2002. These were lifted in 2005.[30]\\r\\nColorado Springs is one of the most active lightning strike areas in the United States. This natural phenomenon led Nikola Tesla to select Colorado Springs as the preferred location to build his lab and study electricity.[36]\\r\\nWinters range from mild to moderately cold, with December, the coldest month, averaging 30.8?F (?0.7?C); historically January has been the coldest month, but, in recent years, December has had both lower daily maxima and minima.[37] Typically, there are 5.2 nights with sub-0?F (?18?C) lows and 23.6 days where the high does not rise above freezing,[38] and extended sub-zero (F) cold snaps are possible but infrequent.\\r\\nSnowfall is usually moderate and remains on the ground briefly because of direct sun, with the city receiving 38 inches (97?cm) per season, although the mountains to the west often receive in excess of triple that amount; March is the snowiest month in the region, both by total accumulation and number of days with measurable snowfall. In addition, 8 of the top 10 heaviest 24-hour snowfalls have occurred from March to May.[38] Summers are warm, with July, the warmest month, averaging 70.9?F (21.6?C), and 18 days of 90?F (32?C)+ highs annually. Due to the high elevation and aridity, nights are usually relatively cool and rarely does the low remain above 70?F (21?C).[38] Dry weather generally prevails, but brief afternoon thunderstorms are common, especially in July and August when the city receives the majority of its annual rainfall, due to the North American Monsoon.[39]\\r\\nThe first autumn freeze and the last freeze in the spring, on average, occur on October 2 and May 6, respectively; the average window for measurable snowfall (0.1?in or 0.25?cm) is October 21 through April 25. Extreme temperatures range from 101?F (38?C) on June 26, 2012 and most recently on June 21, 2016, down to ?27?F (?33?C) on February 1, 1951 and December 9, 1919.[40]\\r\\nAs of the 2010 census, the population of Colorado Springs was 416,427[42] (40th most populous U.S. city), and the population of the Colorado Springs Metropolitan Statistical Area was 645,613 in 2010 (84th most populous MSA),[43] and the population of the Front Range Urban Corridor in Colorado was an estimated 4,166,855.\\r\\nAs of the April 2010 census:[44] 78.8% White, 16.1% Hispanic or Latino (of any race), 6.3% Black or African American, 3.0% Asian, 1.0% Native American, 0.3% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 5.5% Some other race, 5.1% Two or more races. Mexican Americans made up 14.6% of the city's population. The median age in the city was 35 years.[45][nb 1] Non-Hispanic Whites were 70.7% of the population,[47] compared to 86.6% in 1970.[48]\\r\\nColorado Springs' economy is driven primarily by the military, the high-tech industry, and tourism, in that order. The city is currently experiencing some growth mainly in the service sectors. The unemployment rate for the city as of October 2015 was 3.9%, a decrease from 4.8% in October 2014 and 7.3% in November 2013[49] and compared to 3.8% for the state[50] and 5.0% for the nation.[51]\\r\\nThe defense industry plays a major role in the Colorado Springs economy, with some of the city's largest employers coming from the sector.[52] A large segment of this industry is dedicated to the development and operation of various projects for missile defense. With its close ties to defense, the aerospace industry has also influenced the Colorado Springs economy.\\r\\nAlthough some defense corporations have left or downsized city campuses, a slight growth trend is still recorded. Significant defense corporations in the city include Boeing, General Dynamics, Harris Corporation, SAIC, ITT, L-3 Communications, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman.[53][54][55] The Space Foundation is based in Colorado Springs.\\r\\nA large percentage of Colorado Springs' economy is based on manufacturing high tech and complex electronic equipment. The high tech sector in the Colorado Springs area has decreased its overall presence from 2000 to 2006 (from around 21,000 down to around 8,000), with notable reductions in information technology and complex electronic equipment.[56] Due to a slowing in tourism, the high tech sector still remains second to the military in terms of total revenue generated and employment.[citation needed] Current trends project the high tech employment ratio will continue to decrease in the near future.[57][58][59][60]\\r\\nHigh tech corporations with connections to the city include:\\r\\nVerizon Business, a telecommunications firm, had nearly 1300 employees in 2008.[61] Hewlett-Packard has a large sales, support, and SAN storage engineering center for the computer industry.[62][63][64]\\r\\nStorage Networking Industry Association is the home of the SNIA Technology Center.[65] Agilent, spun off from HP in 1999 as an independent, publicly traded company.[citation needed] Intel had 250 employees in 2009.[66] The facility is now used for the centralized unemployment and social services complex.[citation needed]\\r\\nBroadcom (formerly LSI Corporation) designs semiconductors and software that accelerate storage and networking in datacenters and mobile networks.[citation needed] Microchip Technology (formerly Atmel), is a chip fabrication organization.[67] Cypress Semiconductor Colorado Design Center is a chip fabrication research and development site.[citation needed] The Apple Inc. facility was sold to Sanmina-SCI in 1996.[68]\\r\\nAlmost immediately following the arrival of railroads beginning in 1871, the city's location at the base of Pikes Peak and the Rocky Mountains made it a popular tourism destination. Tourism is the third largest employer in the Pikes Peak region, accounting for more than 16,000 jobs.[69][citation needed] Nearly 5 million visitors come to the area annually, contributing $1.35 billion in revenue.[70]\\r\\nColorado Springs has more than 55 attractions and activities in the area,[71] including Garden of the Gods, United States Air Force Academy, the ANA Money Museum, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, Old Colorado City and the U.S. Olympic Training Center.[72]\\r\\nThe downtown Colorado Springs Visitor Information Center offers free area information to leisure and business travelers.[71] The Cultural Office of the Pikes Peak Region (COPPeR), also located downtown, supports and advocates for the arts throughout the Pikes Peak Region. It operates the PeakRadar website to communicate city events.[73]\\r\\nAlthough houses of worship of almost every major world religion can be found in the city, Colorado Springs has in particular attracted a large influx of Evangelical Christians and Christian organizations in recent years. At one time Colorado Springs was counted to be the national headquarters for 81 different religious organizations, earning the city the tongue-in-cheek nicknames \\"the Evangelical Vatican\\"[74] and \\"The Christian Mecca.\\" Religious groups with regional or international headquarters in Colorado Springs include:\\r\\nAlthough Colorado voters approved Colorado Amendment 64, a constitutional amendment in 2013 legalizing retail sales of marijuana for recreational purposes, the Colorado Springs city council voted not to permit retail shops in the city, as was allowed in the amendment.[96] Medical marijuana outlets continue to operate in Colorado Springs.[97] As of 2015, there were 91 medical marijuana clinics in the city, which reported sales of $59.6 million in 2014, up 11 percent from the previous year but without recreational marijuana shops.[98] On April 26, 2016 Colorado Springs city council decided to extend the current six-month moratorium to eighteen months with no new licenses to be granted until May 2017. On July 27, 2017 the Cannabist published an article with a link to a scholarly paper where the author suggest the city will give up 25.4 million dollars in tax revenue and fees if the city continues to thwart the industry from opening within the city limits[99][100]. On March 1, 2018 there were 131 medical marijuana centers and no recreational cannabis stores[101].\\r\\nColorado Springs has been the subject of or setting for many books, movies and television shows, and is a frequent backdrop for political thrillers and military-themed stories because of its many military installations and vital importance to the United States' continental defense. Notable television series using the city as a setting include Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman and the Stargate series Stargate SG-1, as well as the films WarGames and The Prestige.[102]\\r\\nIn a North Korean propaganda video released in April 2013, Colorado Springs was inexplicably singled out as one of four targets for a missile strike.

The majority of the trail between Palmer Lake and Fountain is a soft surface breeze gravel trail. A major segment of the trail within the Colorado Springs city limits is paved.\\r\\nThe Urban Trail system within Colorado Springs consists of more than 110 miles of multi-use trail for biking, jogging, roller blading and walking.\\r\\nThe trails, except Monument Valley Park trails, may be used for equestrian traffic. Motorized vehicles are not allowed on the trails. Many of the trails are interconnected, having main \\"spine\\" trails, like the Pikes Peak Greenway, that lead to secondary trails.[124][125][126]\\r\\nOn November 2, 2010, Colorado Springs voters adopted a council-strong mayor form of government. The City of Colorado Springs transitioned to the new system of government in 2011. Under the council-strong mayor system of government, the mayor is the chief executive and the city council is the legislative branch. The mayor is a full-time elected position and not a member of the city council. The city council has nine members total, six of which represent one of six equally populated districts each. The remaining three members are elected \\"at-large\\".[127] The mayor has veto authority, with the city council having the ability to override a mayoral veto by a two-thirds majority vote (6 out of 9).\\r\\nColorado Springs City Hall was built from 1902 to 1904 on land donated by W.

I-25 runs north and south through Colorado, and traverses the city for nearly 18 miles (29?km), entering the city south of Circle Drive and exiting north of North Gate Blvd. In El Paso County it is known as Ronald Reagan Highway.[nb 3] US 24 runs across the central mountains, through the city, and onto the plains. From west to east in Colorado Springs, US 24 follows the western portion of Cimarron Street and the Midland Expressway, a 2-mile concurrent section with I-25/US 87 between exits 139 and 141, part of Fountain Blvd, an expressway called the Martin Luther King Bypass, part of South Powers Blvd (where it is concurrent with Colorado 21), and the easternmost portion of Platte Avenue out of the city.\\r\\nA number of state highways serve the city. State Highway 21 is a major east side semi-expressway from Black Forest to Fountain. It is widely known as Powers Boulevard. State Highway 83 runs north-south from Denver to northern Colorado Springs. State Highway 94 runs east-west from western Cheyenne County to eastern Colorado Springs. State Highway 115 begins in Ca?on City and runs up Nevada Avenue. US 85 and SH 115 are concurrent between Lake Avenue and I-25. US 85 enters the city at Fountain and was signed at Venetucci Blvd, Lake Avenue, and Nevada Avenue.[nb 4]\\r\\nIn November 2015, voters in Colorado Springs overwhelmingly passed ballot measure 2C, dedicating funds from a temporary sales tax increase to much needed road and infrastructure improvements over five years. This temporary increase is estimated to bring in approximately $50M annually, which will be used solely to improve roads and infrastructure. The Ballot measure passed by a margin of approximately 65ÿ35%,[141] and was championed by newly elected Mayor John Suthers.\\r\\nIn 2004, the voters of Colorado Springs and El Paso County established the Pikes Peak Rural Transportation Authority[142] and adopted a 1% sales tax dedicated to improving the region's transportation infrastructure. Together with state funding for the Colorado Springs Metro Interstate Expansion (COSMIX) (2007 completion) and the I-25 interchange with Highway 16 (2008 completion), significant progress has been made since 2003 in addressing the transportation needs of the area.\\r\\nIn early 2010, the city of Colorado Springs approved an expansion of the northernmost part of Powers Boulevard in order to create an Interstate 25 bypass commonly referred to as the Copper Ridge Expansion.[143][nb 5]\\r\\nColorado Springs Airport (COS), six miles to the southeast, is the second-largest commercial airport in the state.

The program is designed to reduce congestion and pollution by encouraging people to commute by carpool, vanpool, bicycling or walking.\\r\\nSister cities of Colorado Springs include:\\r\\nColorado Springs' sister city organization began when Colorado Springs became partners with Fujiyoshida. The torii gate erected to commemorate the relationship stands at the corner of Bijou Street and Nevada Avenue, and is one of the city's most recognizable landmarks. The torii gate, crisscrossed bridge and shrine, located in the median between Platte and Bijou Streets in downtown Colorado Springs, were a gift to Colorado Springs, erected in 1966 by the Rotary Club of Colorado Springs to celebrate the friendship between the two communities. A plaque near the torii gate states that \\"the purpose of the sister city relationship is to promote understanding between the people of our two countries and cities\\". The Fujiyoshida Student exchange program has become an annual event.[citation needed]\\r\\nTo strengthen relations between the two cities, the Colorado Springs Youth Symphony regularly invites the Taiko drummers from the city to participate in a joint concert in the Pikes Peak Center.

The team has appeared in ten FIFA World Cups, including the first in 1930, where they reached the semi-finals.

Dave Sarachan is the team's interim head coach.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first U.S. national soccer team was constituted in 1885, when it played Canada in the first international match held outside the United Kingdom.[8] Canada defeated the U.S. 1ÿ0 in Newark, New Jersey. The U.S. had its revenge the following year when it beat Canada 1ÿ0, also in Newark, although neither match was officially recognized. The U.S. earned both silver and bronze medals in men's soccer at the 1904 St. Louis Summer Olympics through Christian Brothers College and St. Rose Parish, though the tournament is declared official only by the IOC (FIFA doesn't endorse tournaments held before 1908). The U.S. played its first official international match under the auspices of U.S. Soccer on August 20, 1916, against Sweden in Stockholm, where the U.S. won 3ÿ2.\\r\\nThe U.S. fielded a team in the 1930 World Cup in Uruguay, the first ever World Cup to be played. The U.S. began group play by beating Belgium 3ÿ0. The U.S. then earned a 3ÿ0 victory over Paraguay, with FIFA crediting Bert Patenaude with two of the goals.[9][10][11][12] In November 2006, FIFA announced that it had accepted evidence that Patenaude scored all three goals against Paraguay, and was thus the first person to score a hat trick in a World Cup.[13] In the semifinals, the U.S. lost to Argentina 6ÿ1. There was no third place game. However, using the overall tournament records in 1986, FIFA credited the U.S. with a third-place finish ahead of fellow semi-finalist Yugoslavia.[14] This remains the U.S. team's best World Cup result, and is the highest finish of any team from outside of South America and Europe.\\r\\nThe U.S. qualified for the 1934 World Cup by defeating Mexico 4ÿ2 in Italy a few days before the finals started. In a straight knock-out format, the team first played host Italy and lost 7ÿ1, eliminating the U.S. from the tournament. At the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, the U.S. again lost to Italy in the first round and were eliminated, although this time with a score of 1-0.\\r\\nThe 1950 World Cup in Brazil was the next World Cup appearance for the U.S. as it withdrew in 1938 and the tournament wasn't held again until 1950. The U.S. lost its first match 3ÿ1 against Spain, but then won 1ÿ0 against England at Independncia Stadium in Belo Horizonte. Striker Joe Gaetjens was the goal scorer. Called \\"The Miracle on Grass\\", the result is considered one of the greatest upsets in the history of the World Cup.[15][16] Months before the World Cup, England had beaten an all-star \\"rest of Europe\\" side 6ÿ1 in an exhibition match. In their third game of the tournament, a 5-2 defeat by Chile saw the U.S. eliminated from the tournament. It would be four decades before the U.S. would make another appearance in the World Cup finals.\\r\\nThe national team spent the mid-to-late 20th century in near complete irrelevance in both the international game and the domestic sporting scene. There was only one World Cup berth for CONCACAF during this period until 1982.[17] The emergence of the North American Soccer League in the 1960s and 1970s raised hopes that the U.S. national team would soon improve and become a global force. However such hopes were not realized and by the 1980s the U.S. Soccer Federation found itself in serious financial struggles, with the national team playing only two matches from 1981 to 1983. U.S. Soccer targeted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and the 1986 World Cup as means of rebuilding the national team and its fan base. The International Olympic Committee declared that teams from outside Europe and South America could field full senior teams, including professionals (until then, the amateur-only rule had heavily favored socialist countries from Eastern Europe whose players were professionals in all but name). The U.S. had a very strong showing at the tournament, beating Costa Rica, tying Egypt, losing only to favorite Italy and finishing 1ÿ1ÿ1 but didn't make the second round, losing to Egypt on a tiebraker (both had three points).\\r\\nTo provide a more stable national team program and renew interest in the NASL, U.S. Soccer entered the national team into the NASL league schedule for the 1983 season as Team America. This team lacked the continuity and regularity of training that conventional clubs enjoy, and many players were unwilling to play for the national team instead of their own clubs when conflicts arose. Team America finished the season at the bottom of the league, with U.S. Soccer canceling the experiment and withdrawing the national team from the NASL after one season. By the end of 1984, the NASL had folded, leaving the U.S. without a single professional-level outdoor soccer league.[18]\\r\\nThe U.S. bid to host the 1986 World Cup after Colombia withdrew from contention due to economic concerns, but FIFA selected Mexico to host the tournament. In the last game of CONCACAF qualifying for the 1986 World Cup, the U.S. needed only a tie against Costa Rica to reach the final qualification group against Honduras and Canada. U.S. Soccer scheduled the game to be played in Torrance, California, an area with many Costa Rican expatriates, and marketed the game almost exclusively to the Costa Rican community.[19] Costa Rica won the match 1ÿ0, and kept the U.S. from reaching its fourth World Cup finals.[20]\\r\\nIn 1988, U.S. Soccer attempted to re-implement its national-team-as-club concept, offering contracts to players to train with the national program full-time while occasionally loaning them to club teams as a revenue source for the federation. This brought many key veterans back into the program and allowed the team to begin playing more matches which, combined with an influx of talent from new youth clubs and leagues established across the nation in the wake of the NASL's popularity, allowed the national team to end the 1980s with optimism and higher hopes of qualifying for the 1990 World Cup than had existed for previous tournaments.\\r\\nIn 1988, FIFA named the U.S. as the host of the 1994 World Cup (success of the 1984 Summer Olympics played the major role), but it did so under significant international criticism because of the perceived weakness of the national team and the lack of a professional outdoor league. This criticism diminished somewhat when a 1ÿ0 win against Trinidad and Tobago, the U.S.'s first road win in nearly two years, in the last match of the 1989 CONCACAF Championship, earned the U.S. its first World Cup appearance in 40 years.\\r\\nThe team was managed by Bob Gansler in preparation for the 1990 World Cup in Italy, with two of the team's more experienced players, Rick Davis and Hugo Perez, recovering from serious injuries and unavailable for selection. Rather than fill out his team with veteran professionals from American indoor soccer leagues as suggested by some, Gansler chose to select many younger players with better conditioning for the outdoor game, including some amateurs playing for college teams. The U.S. entered the tournament as massive underdogs and suffered defeats in all three of its group games to Czechoslovakia, Italy, and Austria.\\r\\nIn a historic match, in 1993 U.S. Cup, U.S. beat England by 2ÿ0.[21]\\r\\nAfter qualifying automatically as the host of the 1994 World Cup under Bora Milutinovi?, the U.S. opened its tournament schedule with a 1ÿ1 tie against Switzerland in the Pontiac Silverdome in the suburbs of Detroit, the first World Cup game played indoors. In its second game, the U.S. faced Colombia, then ranked fourth in the world, at the Rose Bowl. Aided by an own goal from Andrs Escobar, the U.S. won 2ÿ1.[22] Escobar was later murdered in his home country, possibly in retaliation for this mistake.[23] Despite a 1ÿ0 loss to Romania in its final group game, the U.S. made it past the initial round for the first time since 1930. In the round of 16, the U.S. lost 1ÿ0 to the eventual champion Brazil.[24] Despite this success, the team fired Bora in 1995, reportedly because he was not interested in administrative duties.[25]\\r\\nIn a 1995 friendly, the U.S. came back from 3ÿ0 to win 4ÿ3 against Saudi Arabia, the biggest comeback in the team's history.\\r\\nIn the 1998 World Cup in France, the team lost all three group matches, 2ÿ0 to Germany, 2ÿ1 to Iran, and 1ÿ0 to Yugoslavia, finishing dead last in the field of 32. Head coach Steve Sampson received much of the blame for the performance as a result of abruptly cutting team captain John Harkes, whom Sampson had named \\"Captain for Life\\" shortly before, as well as several other players who were instrumental to the qualifying effort, from the squad. Thomas Dooley became the Captain at that point.[26] It emerged in February 2010 that Sampson removed Harkes from the team due to Harkes allegedly having an affair with teammate Eric Wynalda's wife.[27]\\r\\nIn the 2002 World Cup under Bruce Arena, the U.S. reached the quarterfinals, its best finish in a World Cup since 1930. The team advanced in the group stage with a 1ÿ1ÿ1 record. The team started with a 3ÿ2 upset win over Portugal, followed by a 1ÿ1 tie with co-host and eventual semi-finalist, South Korea. The third and final match was lost 1ÿ3 to Poland, but the team still got to the round of 16 when South Korea defeated Portugal. This set the stage for a face-off with continental rivals Mexico, the first time they met in a World Cup. The U.S. won the game 2ÿ0. Brian McBride opened the scoring, and Landon Donovan scored the second goal. That victory advanced the team to the quarterfinals, where it met Germany. The team lost 1ÿ0 after being denied a penalty when Torsten Frings handled the ball to prevent a Gregg Berhalter goal. All of the U.S. games in the 2002 World Cup were played in South Korea and all their victories came wearing the white kit while their only defeats came while wearing the blue kit.\\r\\nIn the 2006 World Cup, after finishing top of the CONCACAF qualification tournament, the U.S. was drawn into Group E along with the Czech Republic, Italy, and Ghana. The United States opened its tournament with a 3ÿ0 loss to the Czech Republic. The team then tied 1ÿ1 against Italy, who went on to win the World Cup.[28] The U.S. was then knocked out of the tournament when beaten 2ÿ1 by Ghana in its final group match, with Clint Dempsey scoring the U.S.'s only goal in the tournament ÿ the goal against Italy had been an own goal by Italian defender Cristian Zaccardo.[29] Following the tournament, Arena's contract was not renewed. After the national team remained dormant for the rest of 2006 while negotiating with various coaches, the federation hired former Chicago Fire, MetroStars and Chivas USA manager Bob Bradley in early 2007.\\r\\nBradley began his competitive career with the national team with the 2007 Gold Cup. In the final, the United States beat Mexico 2ÿ1, which qualified it for the 2009 Confederations Cup.[30]\\r\\nThe U.S. had a notable performance at the 2009 Confederations Cup.[31] In the semifinals, the U.S. defeated Spain 2ÿ0.[32] At the time, Spain was atop the FIFA World Rankings and was on a run of 35 games undefeated. With the win, the United States advanced to its first-ever final in a men's FIFA tournament. The team lost 3ÿ2 to Brazil after leading 2ÿ0 at half time.[33]\\r\\nThe United States then hosted the 2009 Gold Cup.[34] In the final, the United States was beaten by Mexico 5ÿ0. This defeat broke the U.S. team's 58-match home unbeaten streak against CONCACAF opponents, and was the first home loss to Mexico since 1999.\\r\\nIn the Fourth round of the 2010 World Cup qualification, the U.S. began by beating Mexico 2ÿ0. The February 2009 loss extended Mexico's losing streak against America on U.S. soil to 11 matches.[35] Jozy Altidore became the youngest U.S. player to score a hat-trick, in a 3ÿ0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago.[36] Near the end of the summer of 2009, the United States lost 2ÿ1 to Mexico at Estadio Azteca. On October 10, the U.S. secured qualification to the 2010 World Cup with a 3ÿ2 win over Honduras. Four days later, the U.S. finished in first place in the group with a 2ÿ2 tie against Costa Rica.\\r\\nIn the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the U.S. team were drawn in Group C against England, Slovenia and Algeria. After drawing against England (1ÿ1) and Slovenia (2ÿ2), the U.S. defeated Algeria 1-0 with a Landon Donovan stoppage time goal. The U.S. won its group for the first time since 1930. In the round of 16, the U.S. was eliminated by Ghana, 2ÿ1.[37] On FIFA's ranking of World Cup teams the U.S. finished in 12th place out of the 32-team field.\\r\\nThe U.S. again hosted the Gold Cup in 2011. The U.S. advanced past the group stage, then defeated Jamaica 2ÿ0 in the quarterfinals and Panama 1ÿ0 in the semifinals before losing Mexico 4ÿ2 in the final. Later in the summer, Bob Bradley was relieved of his duties and former German national team manager Jrgen Klinsmann was hired as head coach.\\r\\nThe U.S. had some success in friendlies in 2012 and 2013. The U.S. team won 1ÿ0 in Italy on February 29, 2012, the team's first ever win over Italy. On June 2, 2013, the U.S. played a friendly against Germany at a sold out RFK Stadium in Washington D.C., with the U.S. winning 4ÿ3. In July 2013, the U.S. hosted the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup where it went undefeated in the group stage and won with a 1ÿ0 victory over Panama in the final, with Landon Donovan winning the tournament's golden ball award.\\r\\nA 4ÿ3 victory over Bosnia in an international friendly match in Sarajevo represented the 12th straight win for the USMNT, the longest winning streak for any team in the world at that time.[38][39][40][41] The 12 game winning streak ended September 6, 2013, when the U.S. lost to Costa Rica 3ÿ1 in San Jos.[42] In 2013 the national team played the final round of qualification,[43][44] and by defeating Mexico in September, the U.S. clinched a spot in the 2014 World Cup.[45]\\r\\nFor the 2014 World Cup, the U.S. was drawn into Group G, along with Ghana, Germany, and Portugal.[46] The U.S. took revenge on the Ghanaians, winning 2ÿ1.[47] They tied their second group game against Portugal 2ÿ2. In the final game of the group stage, the U.S. fell to Germany 1ÿ0, but moved on to the knockout stage on goal difference.[48] This was the first time that the team made two consecutive trips to the knockout stage of the FIFA World Cup.[49] In the round of 16, the U.S. lost 2ÿ1 to Belgium in extra time, despite goalkeeper Tim Howard making a World Cup record 15 saves[50][Note 1] during the match.[51]\\r\\nThe national team's next tournament under Klinsmann was the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup. The U.S. were eliminated by Jamaica 2ÿ1 in the semifinals, before losing to Panama on penalties in the third place match. The fourth-place finish was the worst Gold Cup performance by the national team since 2000, and the first time the team failed to make the tournament final since 2003. In the 2015 CONCACAF Cup playoff to determine the region's entry to the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, the U.S. were defeated 3ÿ2 by Mexico at the Rose Bowl. In June 2016, the U.S. played as hosts of Copa Amrica Centenario. The U.S. topped Group A on goal difference against Colombia. The U.S. beat Ecuador 2ÿ1 in the quarter-finals, but then fell to Argentina 4ÿ0 and lost to Colombia again 1ÿ0 in the third place match. They finished fourth at the Copa Amrica, tying their best finish ever in 1995.\\r\\nFollowing consecutive losses to Mexico and Costa Rica in the opening games of the final round of qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Klinsmann was removed as national team coach and technical director and replaced by previous U.S. manager Bruce Arena. World Cup qualification resumed on March 24, 2017, where Arena and his team had a record 6ÿ0 win over Honduras.[52] Four days later, the team traveled to Panama City, drawing Panama 1ÿ1. After beating Trinidad and Tobago 2ÿ0, the U.S. got their third ever result in World Cup Qualification at the Estadio Azteca when they drew 1ÿ1 against Mexico. In July 2017, the U.S. won their sixth CONCACAF Gold Cup with a 2ÿ1 win over Jamaica in the final. Following an agonizing 2ÿ1 defeat to Trinidad and Tobago on October 10, 2017, the U.S. failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, missing the tournament for the first time since 1986.[53] On October 13, 2017, Arena resigned.[54] Many pundits and analysts called this the worst result and worst performance in the history of the national team.[55]\\r\\nIn June 2018 Earnest Stewart was named General Manager of the U.S. Soccer Federation.\\r\\nSince their first unofficial game against Canada, the most common U.S. uniform has been white tops with blue shorts. In 1950, the U.S. adopted a Peru-styled diagonal stripe or \\"sash\\" across the shirt. The stripe has been on third uniforms for 2003, 2004, and 2006, as well as the 2010 home, road and third uniforms. An additional color scheme based on the U.S. flag has been occasionally used (most prominently in the 1994 World Cup and 2012ÿ13 qualifiers as well the 1983 Team America franchise of the North American Soccer League) comprising a shirt with red and white stripes with blue shorts.\\r\\nAdidas provided the uniforms for the United States from 1985 until 1994. Since 1995, Nike has been the uniform supplier.[56]\\r\\nThe teams of Mexico and the United States are widely considered as the two major powers of CONCACAF. Matches between the two nations often attract much media attention, public interest and comment in both countries. Although the first match was played in 1934, their rivalry was not considered major until the 1980s, when the teams began to frequently compete in CONCACAF cups. On August 15, 2012, the United States defeated Mexico at Estadio Azteca in the first victory for the U.S. against Mexico on Mexican soil in 75 years.[57] Ever since their first meeting in 1934, the two teams have met 65 times, with Mexico leading the overall series 33ÿ18ÿ14 (WÿLÿT), outscoring the U.S. 131ÿ75. However, since the 1990s, the tide began to change due to a rapid growth of soccer in the United States. During the 21st century, the series has favored the U.S. 13ÿ6ÿ5 (WÿLÿT). The United States and Mexico have won every edition of the CONCACAF Gold Cup except one (the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup was won by Canada).\\r\\nIn recent years the United States has also begun to develop a rivalry with Costa Rica.[58][59][60][61][62]\\r\\nThere have been two main supporter groups backing the United States men's national soccer team, Sam's Army and The American Outlaws. Sam's Army started shortly after the 1994 World Cup in the United States[63] and were active through 2014. Sam's Army members wore red to matches and sung or chanted throughout the match. They often brought huge American flags and other banners to the game.\\r\\nThe American Outlaws was started in Lincoln, Nebraska in 2007 as a local supporters' group.[64] The group's membership attempted to address a lack of consistency from game to game in supporter organization and social events on match days.[65] To achieve this goal the American Outlaws became a nationwide, non-profit, supporters' group. Some American Outlaws members wear American flag bandanas over their faces and commonly wear soccer supporter scarves.[66] Some branches of the American Outlaws have their own scarves specific to their branch.[67]\\r\\nThe United States does not have a dedicated national stadium like other national teams; instead, the team has played their home matches at 107 venues in 27 states and the District of Columbia.[citation needed] Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, located in the national capital of Washington, D.C., has hosted 24 matches, the most of any stadium.[68] The state of California has hosted 109 matches, the most of any state, and the Los Angeles metropolitan area has hosted 73 matches at several venues in and around the city of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum hosted 20 matches from 1965 to 2000, but fell out of use due to its age.[citation needed] The Rose Bowl, a 92,000-seat venue in Pasadena, has hosted 17 national team matches, as well as the 1994 FIFA World Cup Final, the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final, and the 1984 Olympics Gold Medal Match.[69]\\r\\nESPN and Fox Sports 1 evenly split the English language rights for U.S. Soccer broadcasts from 2015 to 2022. Univision Deportes has the Spanish language rights to all U.S. Soccer broadcasts from 2015 to 2022.[70] These agreements do not apply to FIFA World Cup away qualifiers, whose rights are distributed by the host country.[71] Therefore, these matches can often be found on other networks such as beIN Sports and Telemundo.[72]\\r\\nFor all past and present players who have appeared for the national team, see United States men's national team players.\\r\\nThe following 20 players were named to the squad for the friendly against France on June 9, 2018.[73][74][75]\\r\\nCaps and goals are updated as of June 9, 2018, after the match against France.\\r\\nThe following players have also been called up to the United States squad within the last twelve months.\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\nThe following is a list of match results from the previous 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\\r\\nFor all past match results of the national team, see single-season articles and the team's results page.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. regularly competes at the FIFA World Cup, the CONCACAF Gold Cup, and the Summer Olympics. The U.S. has also played in the FIFA Confederations Cup, Copa Amrica by invitation, as well as several minor tournaments.\\r\\nThe best result for the United States in a World Cup came in 1930 when they reached the semifinals.[77] The best result in the modern era is the 2002 World Cup, when the U.S. reached the quarterfinals. The worst result in the modern era was a first round elimination in 1990, 1998, and 2006.\\r\\nIn the Confederations Cup, the United States finished in third place in both 1992 and 1999, and were runner-up in 2009. The United States appeared in their first intercontinental tournament final at the 2009 Confederations Cup.[78] In the semifinals, the United States upset top ranked Spain 2ÿ0, to advance to the final. In the final, the United States lost 3ÿ2 to Brazil.\\r\\nThe U.S. men's soccer team have played in the Summer Olympics since 1924. From that tournament to 1976, only amateur players were allowed on Olympic teams per Olympic rules. The Olympics became a full international tournament in 1984 after the IOC allowed full national teams from outside FIFA CONMEBOL & UEFA confederations. Since then the U.S. national team results have dramatically improved. Ever since 1992 the men's Olympic event has been age-restricted, under 23 plus three overage players, and participation has been by the United States men's national under-23 soccer team.\\r\\nIn regional competitions, the United States has won the CONCACAF Gold Cup six times, with their most recent title in 2017.[79] Their best ever finish at the Copa Amrica was fourth-place at the 1995 and 2016 editions.[80][81]\\r\\nCONCACAF Championship 1963ÿ1989, CONCACAF Gold Cup 1991ÿpresent\\r\\nSouth American Championship 1916ÿ1967, Copa Amrica 1975ÿpresent\\r\\nMajor competitions\\r\\nMinor competitions\\r\\nTemplate:Navboxes colour","input":"Who is the coach of the us men's national soccer team?"},{"output":"hologram","context":"","input":"What is a three dimensional image produced by laser light?"},{"output":"the electric generator is steam driven","context":"The steam-electric power station is a power station in which the electric generator is steam driven. Water is heated, turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator. After it passes through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser. The greatest variation in the design of steam-electric power plants is due to the different fuel sources.\\r\\nAlmost all coal, nuclear, geothermal, solar thermal electric power plants, waste incineration plants as well as many natural gas power plants are steam-electric. Natural gas is frequently combusted in gas turbines as well as boilers. The waste heat from a gas turbine can be used to raise steam, in a combined cycle plant that improves overall efficiency.\\r\\nWorldwide, most electric power is produced by steam-electric power plants, which produce about 86% of all electric generation[citation needed]. The only other types of plants that currently have a significant contribution are hydroelectric and gas turbine plants, which can burn natural gas or diesel. Photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and binary cycle geothermal plants are also non-steam electric, but currently do not produce much electricity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReciprocating steam engines have been used for mechanical power sources since the 18th Century, with notable improvements being made by James Watt. The very first commercial central electrical generating stations in New York and London, in 1882, also used reciprocating steam engines. As generator sizes increased, eventually turbines took over due to higher efficiency and lower cost of construction. By the 1920s any central station larger than a few thousand kilowatts would use a turbine prime mover.\\r\\nThe electric efficiency of a conventional steam-electric power plant, considered as saleable energy produced at the plant busbars compared with the heating value of the fuel consumed, is typically 33 to 48% efficient, limited as all heat engines are by the laws of thermodynamics (See: Carnot cycle). The rest of the energy must leave the plant in the form of heat. This waste heat can be disposed of with cooling water or in cooling towers. If the waste heat is instead utilized for e.g. district heating, it is called cogeneration. An important class of steam power plants are associated with desalination facilities; these are typically found in desert countries with large supplies of natural gas and in these plants, freshwater production and electricity are equally important co-products.\\r\\nSince the efficiency of the plant is fundamentally limited by the ratio of the absolute temperatures of the steam at turbine input and output, efficiency improvements require use of higher temperature, and therefore higher pressure, steam. Historically, other working fluids such as mercury have been experimentally used in a mercury vapour turbine power plant, since these can attain higher temperatures than water at lower working pressures. However, the obvious hazards of toxicity, and poor heat transfer properties, have ruled out mercury as a working fluid.\\r\\nSteam-electric power plants utilize a surface condenser cooled by water circulating through tubes. The steam which was used to turn the turbine is exhausted into the condenser. The steam is therefore condensed as it comes in contact with the cool tubes full of circulating water. This condensed steam is withdrawn from the bottom of the surface condenser. The condensed steam is now water, commonly referred to as condensate water.\\r\\nThe adjacent image is a diagram of one of the many typical surface condenser designs.[1][2][3][4]\\r\\nFor best efficiency, the temperature in the condenser must be kept as low as practical in order to achieve the lowest possible pressure in the condensing steam. Since the condenser temperature can almost always be kept significantly below 100 oC where the vapor pressure of water is much less than atmospheric pressure, the condenser generally works under vacuum. Thus leaks of non-condensable air into the closed loop must be prevented. Plants operating in hot climates may have to reduce output if their source of condenser cooling water becomes warmer; unfortunately this usually coincides with periods of high electrical demand for air conditioning. If a good source of cooling water is not available, cooling towers may be used to reject waste heat to the atmosphere. A large river or lake can also be used as a heat sink for cooling the condensers; temperature rises in naturally occurring waters may have undesirable ecological effects, but may also incidentally improve yields of fish in some circumstances.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the case of a conventional steam-electric power plant utilizing a drum boiler, the surface condenser removes the latent heat of vaporization from the steam as it changes states from vapor to liquid. The heat content (btu) in the steam is referred to as Enthalpy. The condensate pump then pumps the condensate water through a feedwater heater. The feedwater heating equipment then raises the temperature of the water by utilizing extraction steam from various stages of the turbine.[1][2]\\r\\nPreheating the feedwater reduces the irreversibilities involved in steam generation and therefore improves the thermodynamic efficiency of the system.[5] This reduces plant operating costs and also helps to avoid thermal shock to the boiler metal when the feedwater is introduced back into the steam cycle.\\r\\nOnce this water is again inside the boiler or steam generator, the process of adding the latent heat of vaporization or Enthalpy is underway. The boiler transfers energy to the water by the chemical reaction of burning some type of fuel. The water enters the boiler through a section in the convection pass called the economizer. From the economizer it passes to the steam drum. Once the water enters the steam drum it goes down the downcomers to the lower inlet waterwall headers. From the inlet headers the water rises through the waterwalls and is eventually turned into steam due to the heat being generated by the burners located on the front and rear waterwalls (typically). As the water is turned into steam/vapor in the waterwalls, the steam/vapor once again enters the steam drum. The steam/vapor is passed through a series of steam and water separators and then dryers inside the steam drum. The steam separators and dryers remove the water droplets from the steam and the cycle through the waterwalls is repeated. This process is known as natural circulation.\\r\\nAny droplets of liquid water carried over into the turbine can produce destructive erosion of the turbine blades.\\r\\nGeothermal plants need no boiler since they use naturally occurring steam sources. Heat exchangers may be used where the geothermal steam is very corrosive or contains excessive suspended solids. Nuclear plants also boil water to raise steam, either directly passing the working steam through the reactor or else using an intermediate heat exchanger.\\r\\nAs the steam is conditioned by the drying equipment inside the drum, it is piped from the upper drum area into an elaborate set up of tubing in different areas of the boiler. The areas known as superheater and reheater. The steam vapor picks up energy and its temperature is now superheated above the saturation temperature. The superheated steam is then piped through the main steam lines to the valves of the high-pressure turbine.\\r\\n[[es:Central termoel?ctrica]] [[gl:Central t?rmica]] [[pt:Central termoel?trica]]","input":"What is the use of steam power generator?"},{"output":"Laughlin Air Force Base","context":"Laughlin Air Force Base (IATA: DLF, ICAO: KDLF, FAA LID: DLF) is a facility of the United States Air Force located in Del Rio, Texas. As a census-designated place, it had a population of 1,648 at the 2015 census.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLaughlin AFB, the largest pilot training base in the US Air Force, is home to the 47th Flying Training Wing of the Air Education and Training Command. On weekdays, the airfield sees more takeoffs and landings than any other airport in the country.[citation needed]\\r\\nLaughlin AFB was originally named Laughlin Army Air Field on March 3, 1943, after Jack T. Laughlin, a B-17E Flying Fortress pilot. He was trained as a pilot and was actually co-pilot of B-17E, Tail number 41-2476. The day of his first bombing mission, he was bumped by the Group Commander Major Stanley K. Robinson (Robinson was co-pilot next to Capt Walter W. Sparks pilot). Major Robinson brought along his own combat experienced navigator, Lt Richard Cease. Laughlin had no assigned position on the plane for the mission. He became Del Rio's first World War II casualty when the plane he was flying in (most likely as a waist gunner for the mission) was lost at sea, having succumbed to damage received over the Makassar Strait on 29 (or 28) January 1942. The damage occurred during two bombing runs against Japanese warships and transports in the Makassar Strait off the coast of Balikpapan, Borneo. The field became simply Laughlin Field on November 11, 1943 and later an Army Air Force Auxiliary Field. During World War II, Laughlin's primary mission was the training of B-26 pilots and aircrews. It was closed in October 1945.\\r\\nLaughlin Air Force Base reopened on May 1, 1952. In October 1952, ATC transferred the base to Crew Training Air Force (CREWTAF) and activated the 3645th Flying Training Wing (Fighter), as a combat crew replacement training facility for pilots headed for Korea. Training provided new pilots with basic bombing and gunnery combat skills in the F-80 Shooting Star, F-84 Thunderjet, and T-33 jet aircraft, but within a short time crews used only the T-33. In Sept. 1955, Laughlin came under the control of the Flying Training Air Force and switched missions with Williams Air Force Base, Arizona. Laughlin undertook single-engine pilot training, still using the T-33.\\r\\nThe Air Force transferred jurisdiction of the base to the Strategic Air Command on April 1, 1957 and the 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (Light) moved there from Turner Air Force Base, Georgia. Following graduation of the last class in March 1957, ATC inactivated the 3645th FTW. The 4080th Wing provided high-altitude reconnaissance and air sampling using the Lockheed U-2A and the RB-57D Canberra. The 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing was redesignated the 4080th Strategic Wing on June 15, 1960, and the RB-57 mission was phased out.\\r\\nLaughlin U-2s were among the first to provide photographic evidence of Soviet missile installations in Cuba in 1962 when 4080th U-2 pilot Major Steve Heyser flew his U-2C over Cuba after taking off from Edwards AFB, California. Heyser landed at McCoy AFB, Florida, following the mission, with McCoy becoming a U-2 operating location for the duration of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The film from Major Heyser's mission was developed, analyzed and the photos were shown to the United Nations Security Council on October 22, 1962, proving to the world, that offensive missiles were on the island of Cuba.\\r\\nAnother 4080th pilot, Major Rudolf Anderson, Jr., perished when his U-2 was hit by shrapnel from a Soviet-made SA-2 on October 22, 1962 while overflying Cuba from McCoy AFB. While U-2 did not suffer a direct hit, Anderson was struck by fragments from the proximity fused warhead's explosion which penetrated and compromised his pressure suit (at altitude, unconsciousness and death came very quickly). His body was returned to the U.S. following the crisis, still clad in its pressure suit. Major Anderson posthumously became the first recipient of the Air Force Cross, the Air Force's second highest decoration for valor. Laughlin's primary operations training complex, Anderson Hall, is named in his honor.\\r\\nIn 1961, Headquarters US Air Force notified Laughlin officials their mission would expand to again include an Air Training Command undergraduate pilot training program. Plans called to transfer in about half the student load from Laredo Air Force Base, Texas. ATC reactivated the 3645th Pilot Training Wing (later redesignated 3646th Pilot Training Wing) at Laughlin in October 1961 to prepare for the phase-in of students and T-37 and T-33 trainers. The 4080th SW continued at Laughlin as a tenant organization until 1963.\\r\\nToday, aircraft flown at Laughlin include the T-6A Texan II, the T-38C Talon and T-1A Jayhawk.

The area is rich in archeology and prehistoric rock art, and contains a wide variety of plant and animal life. Del Rio is home to the George Paul Memorial Bullriding, which is the oldest stand-alone bull riding event in the world. It is also home to the Paul Poag Theatre, and the oldest bonded winery in Texas, the Val Verde Winery, in the heart of Del Rio. Along the San Felipe Creek there are numerous recreational areas including playgrounds, running trails, picnic areas, an amphitheater, a water park and the San Felipe Golf Course. Swimming and tubing are also very popular on the creek. Within a short drive from Del Rio is the world-class Caverns of Sonora, a National Natural Landmark. Additional recreational activities exist across the border in Ciudad Acu?a, however current DoD policy does not allow travel across the border for military personnel.\\r\\nThe residential area of the base is a census-designated place (CDP), with a population of 1,569 at the 2010 census.[1] According to the United States Census Bureau, the base has a total area of 5.9?square miles (15.3?km2), all of it land.\\r\\nAs of the census[2] of 2014, there were 2,225 people, 651 households, and 570 families residing on the base.

In many countries, the feast is also marked as a Holy Day of Obligation in the Roman Catholic Church and as a festival (under various names) in the Anglican Communion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Assumption (Latin: assumptio, \\"a taking\\") was defined as dogma by the Catholic Church in 1950, when Pope Pius XII defined it ex cathedra in his Apostolic Constitution Munificentissimus Deus.[11] The Catholic Church itself interprets chapter 12 of the Book of Revelation as referring to it.[12] The earliest known narrative is the so-called Liber Requiei Mariae (The Book of Mary's Repose), which survives intact only in an Ethiopic translation.[13][14][15] Probably composed by the 4th century, this Christian apocryphal narrative may be as early as the 3rd century. Also quite early are the very different traditions of the \\"Six Books\\" Dormition narratives.[16] The earliest versions of this apocryphon are preserved in several Syriac manuscripts of the 5th and 6th centuries, although the text itself probably belongs to the 4th century.[17][18][19]\\r\\nLater apocrypha based on these earlier texts include the De Obitu S. Dominae,[20] attributed to St. John, a work probably from around the turn of the 6th century that is a summary of the \\"Six Books\\" narrative. The story also appears in De Transitu Virginis,[21] a late 5th-century work ascribed to St. Melito of Sardis that presents a theologically redacted summary of the traditions in the Liber Requiei Mariae. The Transitus Mariae tells the story of the apostles being transported by white clouds to the deathbed of Mary, each from the town where he was preaching at the hour. The Decretum Gelasianum in the 490s declared some transitus Mariae literature apocryphal.\\r\\nAn Armenian letter attributed to Dionysus the Areopagite also mentioned the supposed event, although this was written sometime after the 6th century. John of Damascus, from this period, is the first church authority to advocate the doctrine under his own name. His contemporaries, Gregory of Tours and Modestus of Jerusalem, helped promote the concept to the wider church.\\r\\nIn some versions of the story, the event is said to have taken place in Ephesus, in the House of the Virgin Mary. This is a much more recent and localized tradition. The earliest traditions say that Mary's life ended in Jerusalem (see \\"Mary's Tomb\\"). By the 7th century, a variation emerged, according to which one of the apostles, often identified as St Thomas, was not present at the death of Mary but his late arrival precipitates a reopening of Mary's tomb, which is found to be empty except for her grave clothes. In a later tradition, Mary drops her girdle down to the apostle from heaven as testament to the event.[22] This incident is depicted in many later paintings of the Assumption.\\r\\nTeaching of the Assumption of Mary became widespread across the Christian world, having been celebrated as early as the 5th century and having been established in the East by Emperor Maurice around AD 600.[23] St. John Damascene records the following:\\r\\n\\"St. Juvenal, Bishop of Jerusalem, at the Council of Chalcedon (451), made known to the Emperor Marcian and Pulcheria, who wished to possess the body of the Mother of God, that Mary died in the presence of all the Apostles, but that her tomb, when opened upon the request of St. Thomas, was found empty; wherefrom the Apostles concluded that the body was taken up to heaven.\\" [24]\\r\\nThe Assumption of Mary was celebrated in the West under Pope Sergius I in the 8th century and Pope Leo IV confirmed the feast as official.[23] Theological debate about the Assumption continued, following the Reformation. But the people celebrated the Assumption as part of the cult of Mary that flourished from the Middle Ages. In 1950 Pope Pius XII defined it as dogma for the Catholic Church.[25] Catholic theologian Ludwig Ott stated, \\"The idea of the bodily assumption of Mary is first expressed in certain transitus-narratives of the fifth and sixth centuries.... The first Church author to speak of the bodily assumption of Mary, in association with an apocryphal transitus B.M.V., is St. Gregory of Tours.\\"[26] The Catholic writer Eamon Duffy states that \\"there is, clearly, no historical evidence whatever for it.\\"[27] However, the Catholic Church has never asserted nor denied that its teaching is based on the apocryphal accounts. The Church documents are silent on this matter and instead rely upon other sources and arguments as the basis for the doctrine.\\r\\nPsychologist Carl Jung, who was deeply interested in archetypes and comparative religion, celebrated that the Catholic Church had officially elevated the Virgin Mary (whom he noted as symbolizing the feminine principle) to standing with three masculine figures in the panoply of the church.\\r\\nOn 1 November 1950, in the Apostolic Constitution Munificentissimus Deus Pope Pius XII declared the Assumption of Mary as a dogma:\\r\\nBy the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by our own authority, we pronounce, declare, and define it to be a divinely revealed dogma: that the Immaculate Mother of God, the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory.[28]\\r\\nPope Pius XII deliberately left open the question of whether Mary died before her Assumption.[29][30]\\r\\nBefore the dogmatic definition, in Deiparae Virginis Mariae Pope Pius XII sought the opinion of Catholic Bishops. A large number of them pointed to the Book of Genesis (3:15) as scriptural support for the dogma.[8] In Munificentissimus Deus (item 39) Pius XII referred to the \\"struggle against the infernal foe\\" as in Genesis 3:15 and to \\"complete victory over the sin and death\\" as in the Letters of Paul as a scriptural basis for the dogmatic definition, Mary being assumed to heaven as in 1 Corinthians 15:54: \\"then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory\\".[8][9][10]\\r\\nIn Pius XII's dogmatic statement, the phrase \\"having completed the course of her earthly life,\\" leaves open the question of whether the Virgin Mary died before her assumption or not. Mary's assumption is said to have been a divine gift to her as the 'Mother of God'. Ludwig Ott's view is that, as Mary completed her life as a shining example to the human race, the perspective of the gift of assumption is offered to the whole human race.[31]\\r\\nLudwig Ott writes in his book, Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, that \\"the fact of her death is almost generally accepted by the Fathers and Theologians, and is expressly affirmed in the Liturgy of the Church\\", to which he adds a number of helpful citations. He concludes: \\"for Mary, death, in consequence of her freedom from original sin and from personal sin, was not a consequence of punishment of sin.[32] However, it seems fitting that Mary's body, which was by nature mortal, should be, in conformity with that of her Divine Son, subject to the general law of death\\".[32]\\r\\nThe point of her bodily death has not been infallibly defined by any pope. Many Catholics believe that she did not die at all, but was assumed directly into Heaven. The dogmatic definition within the Apostolic Constitution Munificentissimus Deus which, according to Roman Catholic dogma, infallibly proclaims the doctrine of the Assumption leaves open the question of whether, in connection with her departure, Mary underwent bodily death. It does not dogmatically define the point one way or the other, as shown by the words \\"having completed the course of her earthly life\\".[25]\\r\\nIn Munificentissimus Deus, near the end of the review of the doctrine's history, Pope Pius XII stated?: \\"All these proofs and considerations of the holy Fathers and the theologians are based upon the Sacred Writings as their ultimate foundation.\\" Precedent to this, he cited many passages that have been offered in support of this teaching.\\r\\nThe pope cited 1st Corinthians 15. In this passage Paul alludes to Genesis 3:15 (in addition to the primary reference of Psalms 8:6), where it is prophesied that the seed of the woman will crush Satan with his feet. Since, then, Jesus arose to Heaven to fulfill this prophecy, it follows that the woman would have a similar end, since she shared this enmity with Satan.\\r\\nThe pope also mentioned (in paragraph 26) Psalm 132, a psalm commemorating the return of the Ark of God to Jerusalem and lamenting its subsequent loss. The second half of the psalm says that the loss will be recompensed in the New Covenant, and so it is hopefully prayed, \\"Arise, O Lord, into thy resting place: thou and the ark, which thou hast sanctified\\" (v. 8). Since the Church sees this New Covenant ark in Mary, it understands that she was taken into Heaven in the same manner as the Lord ÿ that is, body and soul.\\r\\nFinally, he mentioned in the next paragraph \\"that woman clothed with the sun [Revelation 12:1ÿ2] whom John the Apostle contemplated on the Island of Patmos\\" was support for the creating this dogmatic doctrine for Catholics.\\r\\nThe Latin Catholic Feast of the Assumption is celebrated on 15 August, and the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholics celebrate the Dormition of the Theotokos (the falling asleep of the Mother of God) on the same date, preceded by a 14-day fast period. Eastern Christians believe that Mary died a natural death, that her soul was received by Christ upon death, and that her body was resurrected on the third day after her death and that she was taken up into heaven bodily in anticipation of the general resurrection. Her tomb was found empty on the third day.\\r\\n\\"... Orthodox tradition is clear and unwavering in regard to the central point [of the Dormition]: the Holy Virgin underwent, as did her Son, a physical death, but her body ÿ like His ÿ was afterwards raised from the dead and she was taken up into heaven, in her body as well as in her soul. She has passed beyond death and judgement, and lives wholly in the Age to Come. The Resurrection of the Body ... has in her case been anticipated and is already an accomplished fact. That does not mean, however, that she is dissociated from the rest of humanity and placed in a wholly different category: for we all hope to share one day in that same glory of the Resurrection of the Body which she enjoys even now.\\"[33]\\r\\nMany Catholics also believe that Mary first died before being assumed, but they believe that she was miraculously resurrected before being assumed. Others believe she was assumed bodily into Heaven without first dying.[34][35] As mentioned earlier, this aspect of the Assumption is not authoritatively described in Catholic theology, and either understanding may be legitimately held by Catholics, with Eastern Catholics observing the Feast as the Dormition.\\r\\nMany theologians note by way of comparison that in the Catholic Church, the Assumption is dogmatically defined, while in the Eastern Orthodox tradition, the Dormition is less dogmatically than liturgically and mystically defined. Such differences spring from a larger pattern in the two traditions, wherein Catholic teachings are often dogmatically and authoritatively defined ÿ in part because of the more centralized structure of the Catholic Church ÿ while in Eastern Orthodoxy, many doctrines are less authoritative.[36]\\r\\nWithin Anglican doctrine, the Assumption of Mary is regarded as adiaphora (\\"a thing indifferent\\") rather than dogma as it is not directly mentioned in the canon of Sacred Scripture or the first five Ecumenical Councils. Even so, 15 August is observed by some within the Anglican Communion as a holy day in honour of Mary. The official name of the Festival varies in the different provinces of the Anglican Communion. In the Church of England, the day is a festival and is called the Falling Asleep of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as with the Eastern Orthodox Church.[3][4] The Book of Common Prayer in the versions of the Scottish Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada mark the date as a commemoration of \\"The Falling Asleep of the Blessed Virgin Mary\\",[37] and in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, it is observed as the holy day of \\"Saint Mary the Virgin, Mother of Our Lord Jesus Christ\\".[38]\\r\\nIn some churches of the Anglican Communion and the Continuing Anglican movement, many Anglicans of Anglo-Catholics churchmanship observe the feast day as the Assumption.\\r\\nThe Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission agreed statement on the Virgin Mary assigns a place for both the Dormition and the Assumption in Anglican devotion.[39]\\r\\nThe Protestant Reformer Heinrich Bullinger believed in the assumption of Mary. His 1539 polemical treatise against idolatry[40] expressed his belief that Mary's sacrosanctum corpus (\\"sacrosanct body\\") had been assumed into heaven by angels:\\r\\nHac causa credimus ut Deiparae virginis Mariae purissimum thalamum et spiritus sancti templum, hoc est, sacrosanctum corpus ejus deportatum esse ab angelis in coelum.[41]\\r\\nFor this reason, we believe that the Virgin Mary, Begetter of God, the most pure bed and temple of the Holy Spirit, that is, her most holy body, was carried to heaven by angels.[42]\\r\\nMost modern Protestants neither teach nor believe in the Assumption of Mary, as they see no biblical basis or extra-biblical basis for it. Although many churches within Lutheranism do not teach the Assumption of Mary, 15 August remains a Lesser Feast in celebration of \\"Mary, Mother of Our Lord\\", according to the Calendar of Saints.[43][44]\\r\\nThe Assumption is important to many Catholic and Orthodox Christians as the Virgin Mary's heavenly birthday (the day that Mary was received into Heaven). Belief about her acceptance into the glory of Heaven is seen by some Christians as the symbol of the promise made by Jesus to all enduring Christians that they too will be received into paradise. The Assumption of Mary is symbolised in the Fleur-de-lys Madonna.\\r\\nThe present Italian name of the holiday, \\"Ferragosto\\", may derive from the Latin name, Feriae Augusti (\\"Holidays of the Emperor Augustus\\"),[45] since the month of August took its name from the emperor. The Solemnity of the Assumption on 15 August was celebrated in the eastern Church from the 6th Century. The Catholic Church adopted this date as a Holy Day of Obligation to commemorate the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a reference to the belief in a real, physical elevation of her sinless soul and incorrupt body into Heaven.\\r\\nAssumption Day on 15 August is a nationwide public holiday in Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chile, Republic of Congo, C?te d'Ivoire, Croatia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cyprus, East Timor, France, Gabon, Greece, Georgia (Eurasia), Republic of Guinea, Haiti, Italy, Lebanon, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Republic of Macedonia, Madagascar, Malta, Mauritius, Republic of Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro (Albanian Catholics), Paraguay, Poland (Polish Army Day), Portugal, Romania, Rwanda, Senegal, Seychelles, Slovenia, Spain, Syria, Tahiti, Togo, and Vanuatu;[46] and was also in Hungary until 1948. British India, was partitioned into India and Pakistan following which, Indian Independence Act (1947) was official on August 15, 1947. It is a day of obligation for all Catholics and it provides an opportunity for all Catholic Indians to attend Mass on for the Feast of the Assumption which is Independence Day and pray for the Indian Nation demonstrating their patriotism [47].\\r\\nIt is also a public holiday in parts of Germany (Bavaria and Saarland) and Switzerland (in 14 of the 26 cantons). In Guatemala, it is observed in Guatemala City and in the town of Santa Maria Nebaj, both of which claim her as their patron saint. Also, this day is combined with Mother's Day in Costa Rica and parts of Belgium.\\r\\nProminent Catholic and Orthodox countries in which Assumption Day is an important festival but is not recognized by the state as a public holiday include Brazil, Czech Republic, Ireland, Mexico, the Philippines and Russia.\\r\\nIn many places, religious parades and popular festivals are held to celebrate this day. In Canada, Assumption Day is the Fte Nationale of the Acadians, of whom she is the patron saint. Some businesses close on that day in heavily francophone parts of New Brunswick, Canada. The Virgin Assumed in Heaven is also patroness of the Maltese Islands and her feast, celebrated on 15 August, apart from being a public holiday in Malta is also celebrated with great solemnity in the local churches especially in the seven localities known as the Seba' Santa Marijiet. The hamlet of Praha, Texas holds a festival during which its population swells from approximately 25 to 5000 people.\\r\\nIn Anglicanism and Lutheranism, the feast is kept, but without official use of the word \\"Assumption\\". In the Armenian tradition, a cultural custom of blessing of the grapes is annually observed each 12 August in religious commemoration of the Feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos.[citation needed] In Eastern Orthodox churches following the Julian Calendar, the feast day of Assumption of Mary falls on 28 August.","input":"When was the feast of the assumption established?"},{"output":"Notre Dame","context":"The NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament is an annual college basketball tournament for women. Held each March, the Women's Championship was inaugurated in the 1981ÿ82 season. The NCAA tournament was preceded by the AIAW Women's Basketball Tournament, which was held annually from 1972 to 1982. Basketball was one of 12 women's sports added to the NCAA championship program for the 1981ÿ82 school year, as the NCAA engaged in battle with the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women for sole governance of women's collegiate sports. The AIAW continued to conduct its established championship program in the same 12 (and other) sports; however, after a year of dual women's championships, the NCAA prevailed, while the AIAW disbanded.\\r\\nAttendance and interest in the Women's Division I Championship have grown over the years, especially from 2003 to 2016, when the final championship game was moved to the Tuesday following the Monday men's championship game.[1] The women's championship game is the penultimate overall game of the college basketball season since 2017. From 1982 to 1990, 1996 to 2002, and since 2017 the Women's Final Four is usually played on the Friday before the Men's Final Four or the hours before the men played on the final Saturday of the tournament. The final was usually played the Sunday afternoon following the Men's Final Four; since 2017, Sunday evening.\\r\\nThe tournament bracket is made up of champions from each Division I conference, which receive automatic bids. The remaining slots are at-large bids, with teams chosen by an NCAA selection committee. The selection process and tournament seedings are based on several factors, including team rankings, win-loss records, and Ratings Percentage Index (RPI) data.\\r\\nUnlike the men's tournament, there are only 32 at-large bids (since 2014), and no play-in game. The women's tournament, like the men's, is staged in a single elimination format and is part of the media and public frenzy known colloquially as March Madness or The Big Dance.\\r\\nAll 63 games have been broadcast on television since 2003 on ESPN and ESPN2.[2] Similar to the pre-2011 men's tournament coverage on CBS, local teams are shown on each channel when available, with \\"whip-around\\" coverage designed to showcase the most competitive contests in the rest of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of 64 teams qualify for the tournament played in March and April. Of these teams, 32 earn automatic bids by winning their respective conference tournaments. Since 2017 the Ivy League conducts their own post-season tournament. The remaining teams are granted \\"at-large\\" bids, which are extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. Dr. Marilyn McNeil, vice president/director of athletics at Monmouth University is the current chairwoman. On March 1, 2011, Bowling Green State University's director of intercollegiate athletics, Greg Christopher, was appointed chair of the NCAA Division I Womens Basketball Committee during the 2011ÿ12 academic year.[3]\\r\\nThe tournament is split into four regional tournaments, and each regional has teams seeded from 1 to 16, with the committee ostensibly making every region as comparable to the others as possible[citation needed]. The top-seeded team in each region plays the #16 team, the #2 team plays the #15, etc.\\r\\nThe first NCAA women's basketball tournament was held in 1982. The AIAW also held a basketball tournament in 1982, but most of the top teams, including defending AIAW champion Louisiana Tech, decided to participate in the NCAA tournament.\\r\\nThe championship consisted of 32 teams from 1982ÿ1985 (in 1983, 36), 40 teams from 1986ÿ1988, and 48 teams from 1989ÿ1993. Since 1994, 64 teams compete in each tournament.\\r\\nPrior to 1996, seeding was conducted on a regional basis. The top teams (eight in the 32-, 40-, and 48-team formats, and 16 in the 64-team format) were ranked and seeded on a national basis. The remaining teams were then seeded based on their geographic region. Teams were moved outside of its geographic region only if it was necessary to balance the bracket, or if the proximity of an opponent outside of its region would be comparable and a more competitive game would result. In 1993, all teams except for the top four were explicitly unseeded. The regional seeding resumed in 1994. In 1996, seeds were assigned on a national basis using an \\"S-Curve\\" format[clarification needed] similar to the process used in selecting the field for the men's tournament.\\r\\nThe following table summarizes some of the key attributes of the seeding process:[4]\\r\\n? Some exceptions. Due to venue availability, in some cases, the lower seed hosted, or the game was played at a neutral site.\\r\\n? From 2003ÿ2014, sixteen predetermined sites were selected for first and second-round games. Teams were allowed to play at home, if hosting.\\r\\nBetween 2005 and 2008, eight sites were used for first-round games.\\r\\nA special selection committee appointed by the NCAA determines which 64 teams will enter the tournament, and where they will be seeded and placed in the bracket. Because of the automatic bids, only 32 teams (the at-large bids) rely on the selection committee to secure them a spot in the tournament.\\r\\nNote: Conferences are listed by all champions' affiliations at that time; these do not necessarily match current affiliations.\\r\\nSince the women's tournament began in 1982, 16 teams have entered the tournament ranked #1 in at least 1 poll and gone on to win the tournament:\\r\\nOnly once has the reigning champion (the previous year's winner) not made it to the tournament the next year.\\r\\nSince 1982, at least one #1 seed has made the Final Four every year.\\r\\nUnder coach Geno Auriemma, Connecticut has been seeded #1 a record 22 times.

Notably, the first two times this occurred were at the hands of the same school:\\r\\nLowest seeds to reach each round since the expansion to 64 teams:\\r\\nUnlike in the men's tournament, no #14 seed has beaten a #3 and no #15 seed has beaten a #2 seed, but they have come close.\\r\\nSince the expansion to 64 teams in 1994, each seed-pairing has played 100 first-round games with these results:\\r\\nSince the expansion to 64 teams in 1994, the following results have occurred for each pairing:\\r\\nnote: The 3 losses by the #1 seed vs #8/9 were: Duke (vs Michigan St, 2009), Ohio St (vs Boston College, 2006), Texas Tech (vs Notre Dame, 1998).\\r\\nnote: The #9 vs. #16 game was Arkansas over Harvard in 1998.\\r\\nOf the 18 teams who have entered the tournament unbeaten, 9 went on to win the National Championship.[6]\\r\\nOnly one team has ever played the Final Four on its home court. Two other teams have played the Final Four in their home cities, and seven others have played the Final Four in their home states.\\r\\nThe only team to play on its home court was Texas in 1987, which lost its semifinal game at the Frank Erwin Special Events Center.\\r\\nOld Dominion enjoyed nearly as large an advantage in 1983 when the Final Four was played at the Norfolk Scope in its home city of Norfolk, Virginia, but also lost its semifinal. The Scope has never been the Lady Monarchs' regular home court. ODU has always used on-campus arenas, first the ODU Fieldhouse and since 2002 the Ted Constant Convocation Center. The following year, USC won the national title at Pauley Pavilion, the home court of its Los Angeles arch-rival UCLA.\\r\\nOf the other teams to play in their home states, Stanford (1992) won the national title; Notre Dame (2011) lost in the championship game; and Western Kentucky (1986), Penn State (2000), Missouri State (2001), LSU (2004), and Baylor (2010) lost in the semifinals.\\r\\n6 championship games have featured two teams from the same conference (winner in bold):\\r\\n267 teams have appeared in the NCAA Tournament in at least a year, since 1982 (the initial year that the post-season tournament was under the auspices of the NCAA).

USDA inspection of poultry was added by the Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act authorizes the FDA to provide inspection services for all livestock and poultry species not listed in the FMIA or PPIA, including venison and buffalo. The Agricultural Marketing Act authorizes the USDA to offer voluntary, fee-for-service inspection services for these same species.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original 1906 Act authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to inspect and condemn any meat product found unfit for human consumption.[1] Unlike previous laws ordering meat inspections, which were enforced to assure European nations from banning pork trade, this law was strongly motivated to protect the American diet. All labels on any type of food had to be accurate (although not all ingredients were provided on the label). Even though all harmful food was banned, a few warnings were still provided on the container. The law was partly a response to the publication of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, an expos of the Chicago meat packing industry, as well as to other Progressive Era muckraking publications of the day.[2] While Sinclair's dramatized account was intended to bring attention to the terrible working conditions in Chicago, the public was more horrified by the prospect of bad meat.[3]\\r\\nThe book's assertions were confirmed in the Neill-Reynolds report, commissioned by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906.[4] Roosevelt was suspicious of Sinclair's socialist attitude and conclusions in The Jungle, so he sent labor commissioner Charles P. Neill and social worker James Bronson Reynolds, men whose honesty and reliability he trusted, to Chicago to make surprise visits to meat packing facilities.\\r\\nDespite betrayal of the secret to the meat packers, who worked three shifts a day for three weeks to thwart the inspection, Neill and Reynolds were still revolted by the conditions at the factories and at the lack of concern by plant managers (though neither had much experience in the field). Following their report, Roosevelt became a supporter of regulation of the meat packing industry, and, on June 30, signed the Meat Inspection Act of 1906.[5]\\r\\nThe FMIA mandated the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspection of meat processing plants that conducted business across state lines.[6] The Pure Food and Drug Act, enacted on the same day in 1906, also gave the government broad jurisdiction over food in interstate commerce.[7]\\r\\nThe four primary requirements of the Meat Inspection Act of 1906 were:\\r\\nAfter 1906, many additional laws that further standardized the meat industry and its inspection were passed.\\r\\nIn 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in National Meat Assn. v.

They were met with fierce police brutality. The number of protesters killed by police is usually given as 176, but estimates of up to 700 have been made.[3][4][5] In remembrance of these events, 16 June is now a public holiday in South Africa, named Youth Day.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack South African high school students in Soweto protested against the Afrikaans Medium Decree of 1974, which forced all black schools to use Afrikaans and English in a 50ÿ50 mix as languages of instruction.[7] The Regional Director of Bantu Education (Northern Transvaal Region), J.G. Erasmus, told Circuit Inspectors and Principals of Schools that from 1 January 1975, Afrikaans had to be used for mathematics, arithmetic, and social studies from standard five (7th grade), according to the Afrikaans Medium Decree; English would be the medium of instruction for general science and practical subjects (homecraft, needlework, woodwork, metalwork, art, agricultural science).[7] Indigenous languages would only be used for religious instruction, music, and physical culture.[8]\\r\\nThe association of Afrikaans with apartheid prompted black South Africans to prefer English. Even the Bantustan regimes chose English and an indigenous African language as official languages. In addition, English was gaining prominence as the language most often used in commerce and industry. The 1974 decree was intended to forcibly reverse the decline of Afrikaans among black Africans. The Afrikaner-dominated government used the clause of the 1909 Union of South Africa Act that recognised only English and Dutch (the latter being replaced by Afrikaans in 1925) as official languages as the pretext to do so.[9] While all schools had to provide instruction in both Afrikaans and English as languages, white South African students learned other subjects in their home language.\\r\\nPunt Janson, the Deputy Minister of Bantu Education at the time, was quoted as saying: \\"A Black man may be trained to work on a farm or in a factory. He may work for an employer who is either English-speaking or Afrikaans-speaking and the man who has to give him instructions may be either English-speaking or Afrikaans-speaking. Why should we now start quarrelling about the medium of instruction among the Black people as well??... No, I have not consulted them and I am not going to consult them. I have consulted the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa?\\"[10]\\r\\nThe decree was resented deeply by blacks, because Afrikaans was widely viewedin the words of Desmond Tutu, bishop of Lesotho and later Dean of Johannesburgas \\"the language of the oppressor\\". Teacher organisations, such as the African Teachers Association of South Africa, objected to the decree.[11] A change in language of instruction forced the students to focus on understanding the language instead of the subject material. This made critical analysis of the content difficult and discouraged critical thinking.[12]\\r\\nThe resentment grew until 30 April 1976, when children at Orlando West Junior School in Soweto went on strike, refusing to go to school. Their rebellion then spread to many other schools in Soweto. Black South African students protested because they believed that they deserved to be treated and taught equally to white South Africans. A student from Morris Isaacson High School, Teboho \\"Tsietsi\\" Mashinini, proposed a meeting on 13 June 1976 to discuss what should be done. Students formed an Action Committee (later known as the Soweto Students' Representative Council),[13] which organised a mass rally for 16 June, to make themselves heard.\\r\\nOn the morning of 16 June 1976, between 10,000 and 20,000[14] black students walked from their schools to Orlando Stadium for a rally to protest against having to learn through Afrikaans in school. Many students who later participated in the protest arrived at school that morning without prior knowledge of the protest, yet agreed to become involved. The protest was planned by the Soweto Students' Representative Council's (SSRC) Action Committee,[15] with support from the wider Black Consciousness Movement. Teachers in Soweto also supported the march after the Action Committee emphasised good discipline and peaceful action.\\r\\nTsietsi Mashinini led students from Morris Isaacson High School to join up with others who walked from Naledi High School.[16] The students began the march only to find out that police had barricaded the road along their intended route. The leader of the action committee asked the crowd not to provoke the police and the march continued on another route, eventually ending up near Orlando High School.[17] The crowd of between 3,000 and 10,000 students made their way towards the area of the school. Students sang and waved placards with slogans such as, \\"Down with Afrikaans\\", \\"Viva Azania\\" and \\"If we must do Afrikaans, Vorster must do Zulu\\".[18]\\r\\nThe police set their dog on the protesters, who responded by killing it.[19] The police then began to shoot directly at the children.\\r\\nAmong the first students to be shot dead were 15 year old Hastings Ndlovu and 13 year old Hector Pieterson, who were shot at Orlando West High School.[20] The photographer Sam Nzima took a photograph of a dying Hector Pieterson as he was carried away by Mbuyisa Makhubo and accompanied by his sister, Antoinette Sithole. The photograph became the symbol of the Soweto uprising. The police attacks on the demonstrators continued and 23 people died on the first day in Soweto. Among them was Dr Melville Edelstein, who had devoted his life to social welfare among blacks He was stoned to death by the mob and left with a sign around his neck proclaiming \\"Beware Afrikaners\\".[21]\\r\\nThe violence escalated, as bottle stores and beer hallsseen as outposts of the apartheid governmentwere targeted, as were the official outposts of the state. The violence abated by nightfall. Police vans and armoured vehicles patrolled the streets throughout the night.\\r\\nEmergency clinics were swamped with injured and bloody children. The police requested that the hospital provide a list of all victims with bullet wounds to prosecute them for rioting. The hospital administrator passed this request to the doctors, but the doctors refused to create the list. Doctors recorded bullet wounds as abscesses.[13][20]\\r\\nThe 1,500 heavily armed police officers deployed to Soweto on 17 June carried weapons including automatic rifles, stun guns, and carbines.[13] They drove around in armoured vehicles with helicopters monitoring the area from the sky. The South African Army was also ordered on standby as a tactical measure to show military force. Crowd control methods used by South African police at the time included mainly dispersement techniques.\\r\\nThe number of people who died is usually given as 176 with estimates up to 700.[4] The original government figure claimed only 23 students were killed;[22] the number of wounded was estimated to be over a thousand people.\\r\\nThe aftermath of the uprising established the leading role of the ANC in the anti-apartheid struggle, as it was the body best able to channel and organise students seeking the end of apartheid. So, although the BCM's ideas had been important in creating the climate that gave the students the confidence to strike out, it was the ANC's non-racialism which came to dominate the discourse of the anti-apartheid movement amongst blacks. The perspectives set out in Joe Slovo's essay No Middle Road ÿ written at just this time and predicting the apartheid government had only the choice between more repression and overthrow by the revolutionaries ÿ were highly influential.[23]\\r\\nThe clashes also occurred at a time when the South African Government was being forced to \\"transform\\" apartheid in international eyes towards a more \\"benign\\" form. In October 1976, Transkei, the first Bantustan, was proclaimed \\"independent\\" by the South African Government. This attempt to showcase supposed South African \\"commitment\\" to self-determination backfired, however, when Transkei was internationally derided as a puppet state.\\r\\nFor the state the uprising marked the most fundamental challenge yet to apartheid and the economic (see below) and political instability it caused was heightened by the strengthening international boycott. It was a further 14 years before Nelson Mandela was released, but at no point was the state able to restore the relative peace and social stability of the early 1970s as black resistance grew.\\r\\nMany white South African citizens were outraged at the government's actions in Soweto, and about 300 white students from the University of the Witwatersrand marched through Johannesburg's city centre in protest of the killing of children. Black workers went on strike as well and joined them as the campaign progressed. Riots also broke out in the black townships of other cities in South Africa.\\r\\nStudent organisations directed the energy and anger of the youth toward political resistance. Students in Thembisa organised a successful and non-violent solidarity march, but a similar protest held in Kagiso led to police stopping a group of participants and forcing them to retreat, before killing at least five people while waiting for reinforcements. The violence only died down on 18 June. The University of Zululand's records and administration buildings were set ablaze, and 33 people died in incidents in Port Elizabeth in August. In Cape Town 92 people died between August and September.\\r\\nMost of the bloodshed had abated by the close of 1976, but by that time the death toll stood at more than 600.\\r\\nThe continued clashes in Soweto caused economic instability. The South African rand devalued fast and the government was plunged into a crisis.\\r\\nThe African National Congress printed and distributed leaflets with the slogan \\"Free Mandela, Hang Vorster\\", immediately linking the language issue to its revolutionary heritage and programme and helping establish its leading role (see Baruch Hirson's \\"Year of Fire, Year of Ash\\" for a discussion of the ANC's ability to channel and direct the popular anger).\\r\\nThe United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 392 which strongly condemned the incident and the apartheid government.[24]\\r\\nA week after the uprising began, Henry Kissinger, the United States Secretary of State, met the South African State President, B. J. Vorster in West Germany to discuss the situation in Rhodesia, but the Soweto uprising did not feature in their discussions.[25] Kissinger and Vorster met again in Pretoria in September 1976, with students in Soweto and elsewhere protesting his visit, and being fired on by police.[26]\\r\\nAfrican National Congress (ANC) exiles called for international action and more economic sanctions against South Africa.[citation needed]\\r\\nImages of the riots spread all over the world, shocking millions. The photograph of Hector Pieterson's dead body, as captured by photojournalist Sam Nzima, caused outrage and brought down international condemnation on the Apartheid government.\\r\\nThe Soweto riots are depicted in the 1987 film by director Richard Attenborough, Cry Freedom, and in the 1992 musical film Sarafina!. The riots also inspired the novel A Dry White Season by Andre Brink, and a 1989 movie of the same title. The Soweto uprising also featured in the 2003 film Stander about notorious bank robber and former police captain, Andre Stander. The lyrics of the song \\"Soweto Blues\\" by Hugh Masekela and Miriam Makeba describe the Soweto Uprising and the children's part in it.[27]\\r\\n20 years after the uprising, in June 1996, the Ulwazi Educational Radio Project of Johannesburg compiled an hour-long radio documentary portraying the events of 16 June entirely from the perspective of people living in Soweto at the time.[28] Many of the students who planned or joined the uprising took part, as did other witnesses, including photographer Peter Magubane, reporter Sophie Tema, and Tim Wilson, the white doctor who pronounced Hector Pieterson dead in Baragwanath hospital. The programme was broadcast on SABC and on a number of local radio stations throughout South Africa. The following year, BBC Radio 4 and BBC World Service broadcast a revised version containing fresh interviews and entitled The Day Apartheid Died.[29] The programme was runner-up at the 1998 European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) TV & Radio Awards and also at the 1998 Media Awards of the One World International Broadcasting Trust, and was highly commended at the 1998 Prix Italia radio awards. In May 1999, it was re-broadcast by BBC Radio 4 as The Death of Apartheid with a fresh introduction, providing added historical context for a British audience, by Anthony Sampson, former editor of Drum magazine and author of the authorised biography (1999) of Nelson Mandela. Sampson linked extracts from the BBC Sound Archive that charted the long struggle against apartheid from the Sharpeville massacre of 1960, through the riots of 1976 and the murder of Steve Biko, and right up to Mandela's release from prison in 1990 and the future president's speech in which he acknowledged the debt owed by all black South Africans to the students who gave their lives in Soweto on 16 June 1976.[30]","input":"How many students were killed in the soweto uprising?"},{"output":"Peloponnesian War","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Peloponnesian War (431ÿ404 BC) was an ancient Greek war fought by the Delian League led by Athens against the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta. Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the Ionian War. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from Persia, supported rebellions in Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens' empire, and, eventually, depriving the city of naval supremacy. The destruction of Athens' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year. Corinth and Thebes demanded that Athens should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved, but Sparta refused.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"Peloponnesian War \\" was never used by Thucydides,  by far its major historian: that the term is all but universally used today is a reflection of the Athens-centric sympathies of modern historians.  As prominent historian J. B. Bury remarks, the Peloponnesians would have considered it the \\"Attic War\\".[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Peloponnesian War reshaped the ancient Greek world. On the level of international relations, Athens, the strongest city-state in Greece prior to the war's beginning, was reduced to a state of near-complete subjection, while Sparta became established as the leading power of Greece. The economic costs of the war were felt all across Greece; poverty became widespread in the Peloponnese, while Athens found itself completely devastated, and never regained its pre-war prosperity.[2][3] The war also wrought subtler changes to Greek society; the conflict between democratic Athens and oligarchic Sparta, each of which supported friendly political factions within other states, made civil war a common occurrence in the Greek world.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreek warfare, meanwhile, originally a limited and formalized form of conflict, was transformed into an all-out struggle between city-states, complete with atrocities on a large scale. Shattering religious and cultural taboos, devastating vast swathes of countryside, and destroying whole cities, the Peloponnesian War marked the dramatic end to the fifth century BC and the golden age of Greece.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the preeminent Athenian historian, Thucydides, wrote in his influential History of the Peloponnesian War, \\"The growth of the power of Athens, and the alarm which this inspired in Lacedaemon, made war inevitable.\\"[5] Indeed, the nearly fifty years of Greek history that preceded the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War had been marked by the development of Athens as a major power in the Mediterranean world. Its empire began as a small group of city-states, called the Delian Leaguefrom the island of Delos, on which they kept their treasurythat came together to ensure that the Greco-Persian Wars were truly over. After defeating the Persian invasion of Greece in the year 480 BC, Athens led the coalition of Greek city-states that continued the Greco-Persian Wars with attacks on Persian territories in the Aegean and Ionia. What then ensued was a period, referred to as the Pentecontaetia (the name given by Thucydides), in which Athens increasingly became in fact an empire,[6] carrying out an aggressive war against Persia and increasingly dominating other city-states. Athens proceeded to bring under its control all of Greece except for Sparta and its allies, ushering in a period which is known to history as the Athenian Empire.  By the middle of the century, the Persians had been driven from the Aegean and forced to cede control of a vast range of territories to Athens. At the same time, Athens greatly increased its own power; a number of its formerly independent allies were reduced, over the course of the century, to the status of tribute-paying subject states of the Delian League. This tribute was used to support a powerful fleet and, after the middle of the century, to fund massive public works programs in Athens, causing resentment.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFriction between Athens and the Peloponnesian states, including Sparta, began early in the Pentecontaetia; in the wake of the departure of the Persians from Greece, Sparta attempted to prevent the reconstruction of the walls of Athens (without the walls, Athens would have been defenseless against a land attack and subject to Spartan control), but was rebuffed.[8] According to Thucydides, although the Spartans took no action at this time, they \\"secretly felt aggrieved\\".[9]\\r\\nConflict between the states flared up again in 465 BC, when a helot revolt broke out in Sparta. The Spartans summoned forces from all of their allies, including Athens, to help them suppress the revolt. Athens sent out a sizable contingent (4,000 hoplites), but upon its arrival, this force was dismissed by the Spartans, while those of all the other allies were permitted to remain. According to Thucydides, the Spartans acted in this way out of fear that the Athenians would switch sides and support the helots; the offended Athenians repudiated their alliance with Sparta.[10] When the rebellious helots were finally forced to surrender and permitted to evacuate the state, the Athenians settled them at the strategic city of Naupactus on the Corinthian Gulf.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 459 BC, Athens took advantage of a war between its neighbors Megara and Corinth, both Spartan allies, to conclude an alliance with Megara, giving the Athenians a critical foothold on the Isthmus of Corinth. A fifteen-year conflict, commonly known as the First Peloponnesian War, ensued, in which Athens fought intermittently against Sparta, Corinth, Aegina, and a number of other states. For a time during this conflict, Athens controlled not only Megara but also Boeotia; at its end, however, in the face of a massive Spartan invasion of Attica, the Athenians ceded the lands they had won on the Greek mainland, and Athens and Sparta recognized each other's right to control their respective alliance systems.[12] The war was officially ended by the Thirty Years' Peace, signed in the winter of 446/5 BC.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thirty Years' Peace was first tested in 440 BC, when Athens' powerful ally Samos rebelled from its alliance with Athens. The rebels quickly secured the support of a Persian satrap, and Athens found itself facing the prospect of revolts throughout the empire. The Spartans, whose intervention would have been the trigger for a massive war to determine the fate of the empire, called a congress of their allies to discuss the possibility of war with Athens. Sparta's powerful ally Corinth was notably opposed to intervention, and the congress voted against war with Athens. The Athenians crushed the revolt, and peace was maintained.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more immediate events that led to war involved Athens and Corinth. After suffering a defeat at the hands of their colony of Corcyra, a sea power that was not allied to either Sparta or Athens, Corinth began to build an allied naval force. Alarmed, Corcyra sought an alliance with Athens, which after debate and input from both Corcyra and Corinth, decided to swear a defensive alliance with Corcyra. At the Battle of Sybota, a small contingent of Athenian ships played a critical role in preventing a Corinthian fleet from capturing Corcyra. In order to uphold the Thirty Years' Peace, however, the Athenians were instructed not to intervene in the battle unless it was clear that Corinth was going to press onward to invade Corcyra. However, the Athenian warships participated in the battle nevertheless, and the arrival of additional Athenian warships was enough to dissuade the Corinthians from exploiting their victory, thus sparing much of the routed Corcyraean and Athenian fleet.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing this, Athens instructed Potidaea (Chalcidice peninsula), a tributary ally of Athens but a colony of Corinth, to tear down its walls, send hostages to Athens, dismiss the Corinthian magistrates from office, and refuse the magistrates that the city would send in the future.[16] The Corinthians, outraged by these actions, encouraged Potidaea to revolt and assured them that they would ally with them should they revolt from Athens. Meanwhile, the Corinthians were unofficially aiding Potidaea by sneaking contingents of men into the besieged city to help defend it. This was a direct violation of the Thirty Years' Peace, which had (among other things) stipulated that the Delian League and the Peloponnesian League would respect each other's autonomy and internal affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nA further source of provocation was an Athenian decree, issued in 433/2 BC, imposing stringent trade sanctions on Megarian citizens (once more a Spartan ally after the conclusion of the First Peloponnesian War). It was alleged that the Megarians had desecrated the Hiera Orgas. These sanctions, known as the Megarian decree, were largely ignored by Thucydides, but some modern economic historians have noted that forbidding Megara to trade with the prosperous Athenian empire would have been disastrous for the Megarans, and have accordingly considered the decree to be a contributing factor in bringing about the war.[17] Historians that attribute responsibility for the war to Athens cite this event as the main cause for blame.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the request of the Corinthians, the Spartans summoned members of the Peloponnesian League to Sparta in 432 BC, especially those who had grievances with Athens to make their complaints to the Spartan assembly. This debate was attended by members of the league and an uninvited delegation from Athens, which also asked to speak, and became the scene of a debate between the Athenians and the Corinthians. Thucydides reports that the Corinthians condemned Sparta's inactivity up to that point, warning the Spartans that if they continued to remain passive while the Athenians were energetically active, they would soon find themselves outflanked and without allies.[19] The Athenians, in response, reminded the Spartans of their record of military success and opposition to Persia, and warned them of the dangers of confronting such a powerful state, ultimately encouraging Sparta to seek arbitration as provided by the Thirty Years' Peace.[20] Undeterred, a majority of the Spartan assembly voted to declare that the Athenians had broken the peace, essentially declaring war.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nSparta and its allies, with the exception of Corinth, were almost exclusively land-based powers, able to summon large land armies which were very nearly unbeatable (thanks to the legendary Spartan forces). The Athenian Empire, although based in the peninsula of Attica, spread out across the islands of the Aegean Sea; Athens drew its immense wealth from tribute paid from these islands. Athens maintained its empire through naval power. Thus, the two powers were relatively unable to fight decisive battles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spartan strategy during the first war, known as the Archidamian War (431ÿ421 BC) after Sparta's king Archidamus II, was to invade the land surrounding Athens. While this invasion deprived Athenians of the productive land around their city, Athens itself was able to maintain access to the sea, and did not suffer much. Many of the citizens of Attica abandoned their farms and moved inside the Long Walls, which connected Athens to its port of Piraeus. At the end of the first year of the war, Pericles gave his famous Funeral Oration (431 BC).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spartans also occupied Attica for periods of only three weeks at a time; in the tradition of earlier hoplite warfare the soldiers were expected to go home to participate in the harvest. Moreover, Spartan slaves, known as helots, needed to be kept under control, and could not be left unsupervised for long periods of time. The longest Spartan invasion, in 430 BC, lasted just forty days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Athenian strategy was initially guided by the strategos, or general, Pericles, who advised the Athenians to avoid open battle with the far more numerous and better trained Spartan hoplites, relying instead on the fleet. The Athenian fleet, the most dominant in Greece, went on the offensive, winning a victory at Naupactus. In 430 BC an outbreak of a plague hit Athens. The plague ravaged the densely packed city, and in the long run, was a significant cause of its final defeat. The plague wiped out over 30,000 citizens, sailors and soldiers, including Pericles and his sons. Roughly one-third to two-thirds of the Athenian population died. Athenian manpower was correspondingly drastically reduced and even foreign mercenaries refused to hire themselves out to a city riddled with plague. The fear of plague was so widespread that the Spartan invasion of Attica was abandoned, their troops being unwilling to risk contact with the diseased enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the death of Pericles, the Athenians turned somewhat against his conservative, defensive strategy and to the more aggressive strategy of bringing the war to Sparta and its allies. Rising to particular importance in Athenian democracy at this time was Cleon, a leader of the hawkish elements of the Athenian democracy. Led militarily by a clever new general Demosthenes (not to be confused with the later Athenian orator Demosthenes), the Athenians managed some successes as they continued their naval raids on the Peloponnese. Athens stretched their military activities into Boeotia and Aetolia, quelled the Mytilenean revolt and began fortifying posts around the Peloponnese. One of these posts was near Pylos on a tiny island called Sphacteria, where the course of the first war turned in Athens's favour. The post off Pylos struck Sparta where it was weakest: its dependence on the helots, who tended the fields while its citizens trained to become soldiers. The helots made the Spartan system possible, but now the post off Pylos began attracting helot runaways. In addition, the fear of a general revolt of helots emboldened by the nearby Athenian presence drove the Spartans to action. Demosthenes, however, outmanoeuvred the Spartans in the Battle of Pylos in 425 BC and trapped a group of Spartan soldiers on Sphacteria as he waited for them to surrender. Weeks later, though, Demosthenes proved unable to finish off the Spartans. After boasting that he could put an end to the affair in the Assembly, the inexperienced Cleon won a great victory at the Battle of Sphacteria. The Athenians captured 300 Spartan hoplites. The hostages gave the Athenians a bargaining chip.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter these battles, the Spartan general Brasidas raised an army of allies and helots and marched the length of Greece to the Athenian colony of Amphipolis in Thrace, which controlled several nearby silver mines; their product supplied much of the Athenian war fund. Thucydides was dispatched with a force which arrived too late to stop Brasidas capturing Amphipolis; Thucydides was exiled for this, and, as a result, had the conversations with both sides of the war which inspired him to record its history. Both Brasidas and Cleon were killed in Athenian efforts to retake Amphipolis (see Battle of Amphipolis). The Spartans and Athenians agreed to exchange the hostages for the towns captured by Brasidas, and signed a truce.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the death of Cleon and Brasidas, zealous war hawks for both nations, the Peace of Nicias was able to last for some six years. However, it was a time of constant skirmishing in and around the Peloponnese. While the Spartans refrained from action themselves, some of their allies began to talk of revolt. They were supported in this by Argos, a powerful state within the Peloponnese that had remained independent of Lacedaemon. With the support of the Athenians, the Argives succeeded in forging a coalition of democratic states within the Peloponnese, including the powerful states of Mantinea and Elis. Early Spartan attempts to break up the coalition failed, and the leadership of the Spartan king Agis was called into question. Emboldened, the Argives and their allies, with the support of a small Athenian force under Alcibiades, moved to seize the city of Tegea, near Sparta.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Battle of Mantinea was the largest land battle fought within Greece during the Peloponnesian War. The Lacedaemonians, with their neighbors the Tegeans, faced the combined armies of Argos, Athens, Mantinea, and Arcadia. In the battle, the allied coalition scored early successes, but failed to capitalize on them, which allowed the Spartan elite forces to defeat the forces opposite them. The result was a complete victory for the Spartans, which rescued their city from the brink of strategic defeat. The democratic alliance was broken up, and most of its members were reincorporated into the Peloponnesian League. With its victory at Mantinea, Sparta pulled itself back from the brink of utter defeat, and re-established its hegemony throughout the Peloponnese.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 17th year of the war, word came to Athens that one of their distant allies in Sicily was under attack from Syracuse. The people of Syracuse were ethnically Dorian (as were the Spartans), while the Athenians, and their ally in Sicilia, were Ionian. The Athenians felt obliged to assist their ally.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Athenians did not act solely from altruism: rallied on by Alcibiades, the leader of the expedition, they held visions of conquering all of Sicily. Syracuse, the principal city of Sicily, was not much smaller than Athens, and conquering all of Sicily would have brought Athens an immense amount of resources. In the final stages of the preparations for departure, the hermai (religious statues) of Athens were mutilated by unknown persons, and Alcibiades was charged with religious crimes. Alcibiades demanded that he be put on trial at once, so that he might defend himself before the expedition. The Athenians however allowed Alcibiades to go on the expedition without being tried (many believed in order to better plot against him). After arriving in Sicily, Alcibiades was recalled to Athens for trial. Fearing that he would be unjustly condemned, Alcibiades defected to Sparta and Nicias was placed in charge of the mission. After his defection, Alcibiades claimed to the Spartans that the Athenians planned to use Sicily as a springboard for the conquest of all of Italy and Carthage, and to use the resources and soldiers from these new conquests to conquer the Peloponnese.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Athenian force consisted of over 100 ships and some 5,000 infantry and light-armored troops. Cavalry was limited to about 30 horses, which proved to be no match for the large and highly trained Syracusan cavalry. Upon landing in Sicily, several cities immediately joined the Athenian cause. Instead of attacking at once, Nicias procrastinated and the campaigning season of 415 BC ended with Syracuse scarcely damaged. With winter approaching, the Athenians were then forced to withdraw into their quarters, and they spent the winter gathering allies and preparing to destroy Syracuse. The delay allowed the Syracusans to send for help from Sparta, who sent their general Gylippus to Sicily with reinforcements. Upon arriving, he raised up a force from several Sicilian cities, and went to the relief of Syracuse. He took command of the Syracusan troops, and in a series of battles defeated the Athenian forces, and prevented them from invading the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nNicias then sent word to Athens asking for reinforcements. Demosthenes was chosen and led another fleet to Sicily, joining his forces with those of Nicias. More battles ensued and again, the Syracusans and their allies defeated the Athenians. Demosthenes argued for a retreat to Athens, but Nicias at first refused. After additional setbacks, Nicias seemed to agree to a retreat until a bad omen, in the form of a lunar eclipse, delayed any withdrawal. The delay was costly and forced the Athenians into a major sea battle in the Great Harbor of Syracuse. The Athenians were thoroughly defeated. Nicias and Demosthenes marched their remaining forces inland in search of friendly allies. The Syracusan cavalry rode them down mercilessly, eventually killing or enslaving all who were left of the mighty Athenian fleet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lacedaemonians were not content with simply sending aid to Sicily; they also resolved to take the war to the Athenians. On the advice of Alcibiades, they fortified Decelea, near Athens, and prevented the Athenians from making use of their land year round. The fortification of Decelea prevented the shipment of supplies overland to Athens, and forced all supplies to be brought in by sea at increased expense. Perhaps worst of all, the nearby silver mines were totally disrupted, with as many as 20,000 Athenian slaves freed by the Spartan hoplites at Decelea. With the treasury and emergency reserve fund of 1,000 talents dwindling away, the Athenians were forced to demand even more tribute from her subject allies, further increasing tensions and the threat of further rebellion within the Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Corinthians, the Spartans, and others in the Peloponnesian League sent more reinforcements to Syracuse, in the hopes of driving off the Athenians; but instead of withdrawing, the Athenians sent another hundred ships and another 5,000 troops to Sicily. Under Gylippus, the Syracusans and their allies were able to decisively defeat the Athenians on land; and Gylippus encouraged the Syracusans to build a navy, which was able to defeat the Athenian fleet when they attempted to withdraw. The Athenian army, attempting to withdraw overland to other, more friendly Sicilian cities, was divided and defeated; the entire Athenian fleet was destroyed, and virtually the entire Athenian army was sold off into slavery.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the defeat of the Athenians in Sicily, it was widely believed that the end of the Athenian Empire was at hand. Her treasury was nearly empty, her docks were depleted, and the flower of her youth was dead or imprisoned in a foreign land. They overestimated the strength of their own empire and the beginning of the end was indeed imminent.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the destruction of the Sicilian Expedition, Lacedaemon encouraged the revolt of Athens's tributary allies, and indeed, much of Ionia rose in revolt against Athens. The Syracusans sent their fleet to the Peloponnesians, and the Persians decided to support the Spartans with money and ships. Revolt and faction threatened in Athens itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Athenians managed to survive for several reasons. First, their foes were lacking in initiative. Corinth and Syracuse were slow to bring their fleets into the Aegean, and Sparta's other allies were also slow to furnish troops or ships. The Ionian states that rebelled expected protection, and many rejoined the Athenian side. The Persians were slow to furnish promised funds and ships, frustrating battle plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the start of the war, the Athenians had prudently put aside some money and 100 ships that were to be used only as a last resort.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese ships were then released, and served as the core of the Athenians' fleet throughout the rest of the war. An oligarchical revolution occurred in Athens, in which a group of 400 seized power. A peace with Sparta might have been possible, but the Athenian fleet, now based on the island of Samos, refused to accept the change. In 411 BC this fleet engaged the Spartans at the Battle of Syme. The fleet appointed Alcibiades their leader, and continued the war in Athens's name. Their opposition led to the reinstitution of a democratic government in Athens within two years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlcibiades, while condemned as a traitor, still carried weight in Athens. He prevented the Athenian fleet from attacking Athens; instead, he helped restore democracy by more subtle pressure. He also persuaded the Athenian fleet to attack the Spartans at the battle of Cyzicus in 410. In the battle, the Athenians obliterated the Spartan fleet, and succeeded in re-establishing the financial basis of the Athenian Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 410 and 406, Athens won a continuous string of victories, and eventually recovered large portions of its empire. All of this was due, in no small part, to Alcibiades.\\r\\n\\r\\nFaction triumphed in Athens following a minor Spartan victory by their skillful general Lysander at the naval battle of Notium in 406 BC. Alcibiades was not re-elected general by the Athenians and he exiled himself from the city. He would never again lead Athenians in battle. Athens was then victorious at the naval battle of Arginusae. The Spartan fleet under Callicratidas lost 70 ships and the Athenians lost 25 ships. But, due to bad weather, the Athenians were unable to rescue their stranded crews or to finish off the Spartan fleet. Despite their victory, these failures caused outrage in Athens and led to a controversial trial. The trial resulted in the execution of six of Athenss top naval commanders. Athenss naval supremacy would now be challenged without several of its most able military leaders and a demoralized navy.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike some of his predecessors the new Spartan general, Lysander, was not a member of the Spartan royal families and was also formidable in naval strategy; he was an artful diplomat, who had even cultivated good personal relationships with the Persian prince Cyrus, the son of Darius II. Seizing its opportunity, the Spartan fleet sailed at once to the Hellespont, the source of Athens' grain. Threatened with starvation, the Athenian fleet had no choice but to follow. Through cunning strategy, Lysander totally defeated the Athenian fleet, in 405 BC, at the Battle of Aegospotami, destroying 168 ships and capturing some three or four thousand Athenian sailors. Only 12 Athenian ships escaped, and several of these sailed to Cyprus, carrying the \\"strategos\\" (General) Conon, who was anxious not to face the judgment of the Assembly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFacing starvation and disease from the prolonged siege, Athens surrendered in 404 BC, and its allies soon surrendered as well. The democrats at Samos, loyal to the bitter last, held on slightly longer, and were allowed to flee with their lives. The surrender stripped Athens of its walls, its fleet, and all of its overseas possessions. Corinth and Thebes demanded that Athens should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved. However, the Spartans announced their refusal to destroy a city that had done a good service at a time of greatest danger to Greece, and took Athens into their own system. Athens was \\"to have the same friends and enemies\\" as Sparta.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe overall effect of the war in Greece proper was to substitute a Spartan empire for an Athenian one.  After the battle of Aegospotami, Sparta took over the Athenian empire and kept all of its tribute revenues for itself; Sparta's allies, who had made greater sacrifices for the war effort than had Sparta, got nothing.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a short period of time, Athens was ruled by the \\"Thirty Tyrants\\", and democracy was suspended. This was a reactionary regime set up by Sparta. In 403 BC, the oligarchs were overthrown and a democracy was restored by Thrasybulus.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the power of Athens was broken, it made something of a recovery as a result of the Corinthian War and continued to play an active role in Greek politics. Sparta was later humbled by Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC, but the rivalry between Athens and Sparta was brought to an end a few decades later when Philip II of Macedon conquered all of Greece except Sparta.","input":"What was the war between sparta and athens?"},{"output":"John Roberts","context":"","input":"Who is the supreme court made up of?"},{"output":"Hepatitis B","context":"Sexually transmitted infections (STI), also referred to as sexually transmitted diseases (STD) or venereal diseases (VD), are infections that are commonly spread by sexual activity, especially vaginal intercourse, anal sex and oral sex.[1][5] Many times STIs initially do not cause symptoms.[1] This results in a greater risk of passing the disease on to others.[6][7] Symptoms and signs of disease may include vaginal discharge, penile discharge, ulcers on or around the genitals, and pelvic pain.[1] STIs can be transmitted to an infant before or during childbirth and may result in poor outcomes for the baby.[1][8] Some STIs may cause problems with the ability to get pregnant.[1]\\r\\nMore than 30 different bacteria, viruses, and parasites can be transmitted through sexual activity.[1] Bacterial STIs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.[1] Viral STIs include genital herpes, HIV/AIDS, and genital warts.[1] Parasitic STIs include trichomoniasis.[1] While usually spread by sex, some STIs can be spread by non-sexual contact with donor tissue, blood, breastfeeding, or during childbirth.[1] STI diagnostic tests are usually easily available in the developed world, but this is often not the case in the developing world.[1]\\r\\nThe most effective way of preventing STIs is by not having sex.[2] Some vaccinations may also decrease the risk of certain infections including hepatitis B and some types of HPV.[2] Safer sex practices such as use of condoms, having a smaller number of sexual partners, and being in a relationship where each person only has sex with the other also decreases the risk.[1][2] Circumcision in males may be effective to prevent some infections.[1] During school, comprehensive sex education may also be useful.[9] Most STIs are treatable or curable.[1] Of the most common infections, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis are curable, while herpes, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, and HPV are treatable but not curable.[1] Resistance to certain antibiotics is developing among some organisms such as gonorrhea.[10]\\r\\nIn 2015, about 1.1 billion people had STIs other than HIV/AIDS.[3] About 500 million were infected with either syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia or trichomoniasis.[1] At least an additional 530 million people have genital herpes and 290 million women have human papillomavirus.[1] STIs other than HIV resulted in 108,000 deaths in 2015.[4] In the United States there were 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted infections in 2010.[11] Historical documentation of STIs date back to at least the Ebers papyrus around 1550 BC and the Old Testament.[12] There is often shame and stigma associated with these infections.[1] The term sexually transmitted infection is generally preferred over sexually transmitted disease or venereal disease, as it includes those who do not have symptomatic disease.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 1990s,[citation needed] STIs were commonly known as venereal diseases, the word venereal being derived from the Latin word venereus, and meaning relating to sexual intercourse or desire, ultimately derived from Venus, the Roman goddess of love.[14] STIs have been euphemistically referred to as \\"blood diseases\\" and \\"social diseases\\" in the past.[15]\\r\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the more inclusive term sexually transmitted infection since 1999.[13] Public health officials originally introduced the term sexually transmitted infection, which clinicians are increasingly using alongside the term sexually transmitted disease in order to distinguish it from the former.[16]\\r\\nNot all STIs are symptomatic, and symptoms may not appear immediately after infection.

The transfer of and exposure to bodily fluids, such as blood transfusions and other blood products, sharing injection needles, needle-stick injuries (when medical staff are inadvertently jabbed or pricked with needles during medical procedures), sharing tattoo needles, and childbirth are other avenues of transmission. These different means put certain groups, such as medical workers, and haemophiliacs and drug users, particularly at risk.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt is possible to be an asymptomatic carrier of sexually transmitted diseases. In particular, sexually transmitted diseases in women often cause the serious condition of pelvic inflammatory disease.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strategies for reducing STD risk include: vaccination, mutual monogamy, reducing the number of sexual partners and abstinence.[79]\\r\\nThe most effective way to prevent sexual transmission of STIs is to avoid contact of body parts or fluids which can lead to transfer with an infected partner. Not all sexual activities involve contact: cybersex, phonesex or masturbation from a distance are methods of avoiding contact. Proper use of condoms reduces contact and risk. Although a condom is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur even with a condom.[80]\\r\\nBoth partners can get tested for STIs before initiating sexual contact, or before resuming contact if a partner engaged in contact with someone else. Many infections are not detectable immediately after exposure, so enough time must be allowed between possible exposures and testing for the tests to be accurate. Certain STIs, particularly certain persistent viruses like HPV, may be impossible to detect with current medical procedures.[medical citation needed]\\r\\nSome treatment facilities utilize in-home test kits and have the person return the test for follow-up. Other facilities strongly encourage that those previously infected return to ensure that the infection has been eliminated. Novel strategies to foster re-testing have been the use of text messaging and email as reminders. These types of reminders are now used in addition to phone calls and letters.[81] After obtaining a sexual history, a healthcare provider can encourage risk reduction by providing prevention counseling. Prevention counseling is most effective if provided in a nonjudgmental and empathetic manner appropriate to the person's culture, language, gender, sexual orientation, age, and developmental level. Prevention counseling for STIs is usually offered to all sexually active adolescents and to all adults who have received a diagnosis, have had an STI in the past year, or have multiple sex partners.[82]\\r\\nUSPSTF recommends high-intensity behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults at increased risk for STIs. Such interactive counseling, which can be resource intensive, is directed at a person's risk, the situations in which risk occurs, and the use of personalized goal-setting strategies.[82]\\r\\nVaccines are available that protect against some viral STIs, such as Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and some types of HPV.[83] Vaccination before initiation of sexual contact is advised to assure maximal protection. The development of vaccines to protect against gonorrhea is ongoing.[84]\\r\\nCondoms and female condoms only provide protection when used properly as a barrier, and only to and from the area that they cover. Uncovered areas are still susceptible to many STIs.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the case of HIV, sexual transmission routes almost always involve the penis, as HIV cannot spread through unbroken skin; therefore, properly shielding the penis with a properly worn condom from the vagina or anus effectively stops HIV transmission. An infected fluid to broken skin borne direct transmission of HIV would not be considered \\"sexually transmitted\\", but can still theoretically occur during sexual contact. This can be avoided simply by not engaging in sexual contact when presenting open, bleeding wounds.[citation needed]\\r\\nOther STIs, even viral infections, can be prevented with the use of latex, polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms as a barrier. Some microorganisms and viruses are small enough to pass through the pores in natural skin condoms, but are still too large to pass through latex or synthetic condoms.[citation needed]\\r\\nProper male condom usage entails:[citation needed]\\r\\nIn order to best protect oneself and the partner from STIs, the old condom and its contents are be assumed to be infectious. Therefore, the old condom must be properly disposed of. A new condom is used for each act of intercourse, as multiple usage increases the chance of breakage, defeating the effectiveness as a barrier.[citation needed]\\r\\nResearchers had hoped that nonoxynol-9, a vaginal microbicide would help decrease STI risk. Trials, however, have found it ineffective[85] and it may put women at a higher risk of HIV infection.[86]\\r\\nSpecific age groups, persons who participate in risky sexual behavior, or those have certain health conditions may require screening. The CDC recommends that sexually active women under the age of 25 and those over 25 at risk should be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea yearly. Appropriate times for screening are during regular pelvic examinations and preconception evaluations.[87] Nucleic acid amplification tests are the recommended method of diagnosis for gonorrhea and chlamydia.[88] This can be done on either urine in both men and women, vaginal or cervical swabs in women, or urethral swabs in men.[88] Screening can be performed:\\r\\nTesting may be for a single infection, or consist of a number of tests for a range of STIs, including tests for syphilis, trichomonas, gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes, hepatitis and HIV. No procedure tests for all infectious agents.\\r\\nSTI tests may be used for a number of reasons:\\r\\nEarly identification and treatment results in less chance to spread disease, and for some conditions may improve the outcomes of treatment. There is often a window period after initial infection during which an STI test will be negative. During this period, the infection may be transmissible. The duration of this period varies depending on the infection and the test. Diagnosis may also be delayed by reluctance of the infected person to seek a medical professional. One report indicated that people turn to the Internet rather than to a medical professional for information on STIs to a higher degree than for other sexual problems.[89]\\r\\nIn the case of rape, the person can be treated prophylacticly with antibiotics.[90]\\r\\nAn option for treating partners of patients (index cases) diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea is patient-delivered partner therapy, which is the clinical practice of treating the sex partners of index cases by providing prescriptions or medications to the patient to take to his/her partner without the health care provider first examining the partner.[91][needs update]\\r\\nIn 2008, it was estimated that 500 million people were infected with either syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia or trichomoniasis.[1] At least an additional 530 million people have genital herpes and 290 million women have human papillomavirus.[1] STIs other than HIV resulted in 142,000 deaths in 2013.[93] In the United States there were 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted infections in 2010.[11]\\r\\nIn 2010, 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted infections occurred in women in the United States.[5] A 2008 CDC study found that 25ÿ40% of U.S. teenage girls has a sexually transmitted disease.[94][95]\\r\\nAIDS is among the leading causes of death in present-day Sub-Saharan Africa.[96] HIV/AIDS is transmitted primarily via unprotected sexual intercourse. More than 1.1 million persons are living with HIV/AIDS in the United States,[97] and it disproportionately impacts African Americans.[98] Hepatitis B is also considered a sexually transmitted disease because it can be spread through sexual contact.[99] The highest rates are found in Asia and Africa and lower rates are in the Americas and Europe.[100] Approximately two billion people worldwide have been infected with the hepatitis B virus.[101]\\r\\nThe first well-recorded European outbreak of what is now known as syphilis occurred in 1494 when it broke out among French troops besieging Naples in the Italian War of 1494ÿ98.[102] The disease may have originated from the Columbian Exchange.[103] From Naples, the disease swept across Europe, killing more than five million people.[104] As Jared Diamond describes it, \\"[W]hen syphilis was first definitely recorded in Europe in 1495, its pustules often covered the body from the head to the knees, caused flesh to fall from people's faces, and led to death within a few months,\\" rendering it far more fatal than it is today. Diamond concludes,\\"[B]y 1546, the disease had evolved into the disease with the symptoms so well known to us today.\\"[105] Gonorrhoeae is recorded at least up to 700 years ago and associated with a district in Paris formerly known as \\"Le Clapiers\\". This is where the prostitutes were to be found at that time.[84]\\r\\nPrior to the invention of modern medicines, sexually transmitted diseases were generally incurable, and treatment was limited to treating the symptoms of the disease. The first voluntary hospital for venereal diseases was founded in 1746 at London Lock Hospital.[106] Treatment was not always voluntary: in the second half of the 19th century, the Contagious Diseases Acts were used to arrest suspected prostitutes. In 1924, a number of states concluded the Brussels Agreement, whereby states agreed to provide free or low-cost medical treatment at ports for merchant seamen with venereal diseases.\\r\\nThe first effective treatment for a sexually transmitted disease was salvarsan, a treatment for syphilis. With the discovery of antibiotics, a large number of sexually transmitted diseases became easily curable, and this, combined with effective public health campaigns against STDs, led to a public perception during the 1960s and 1970s that they have ceased to be a serious medical threat.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring this period, the importance of contact tracing in treating STIs was recognized. By tracing the sexual partners of infected individuals, testing them for infection, treating the infected and tracing their contacts in turn, STI clinics could effectively suppress infections in the general population.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the 1980s, first genital herpes and then AIDS emerged into the public consciousness as sexually transmitted diseases that could not be cured by modern medicine. AIDS in particular has a long asymptomatic periodduring which time HIV (the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS) can replicate and the disease can be transmitted to othersfollowed by a symptomatic period, which leads rapidly to death unless treated. HIV/AIDS entered the United States from Haiti in about 1969.[107] Recognition that AIDS threatened a global pandemic led to public information campaigns and the development of treatments that allow AIDS to be managed by suppressing the replication of HIV for as long as possible. Contact tracing continues to be an important measure, even when diseases are incurable, as it helps to contain infection.\\r\\nIn the 1996 sexual harassment case filed against Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a number of male employees referred to sexually transmitted infections as souvenirs.[108]","input":"What is the number 1 sexually transmitted disease?"},{"output":"Black Elk Peak","context":"\\r\\nBlack Elk Peak (formerly Harney Peak) is the highest natural point in South Dakota, United States. It lies in the Black Elk Wilderness area, in southern Pennington County, in the Black Hills National Forest.[2] The peak lies 3.7?mi (6.0?km) west-southwest of Mount Rushmore.[5] At 7,242 feet (2,207?m),[1] it has been described by the Board on Geographical Names as the highest summit in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. It is also known as Hi?h? K?a (in Lakota).\\r\\nThe U.S. Board on Geographic Names, which has jurisdiction in federal lands, officially changed the mountain's name from \\"Harney Peak\\" to \\"Black Elk Peak\\" on August 11, 2016, honoring Black Elk, the noted Lakota Sioux medicine man for whom the Wilderness Area is named.[6]\\r\\nProfessional but unofficial measurements in 2016 found the highest natural rock to be at 7,231.32 feet (2,204.11?m) NAVD88 and the nearby secondary peak slightly lower at 7,229.41 feet (2,203.52?m).[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis peak was called Hi?h? K?a (\\"Owl maker\\", after rock formations that look like owls[9] and the association of owls with impending death by the Lakota Sioux).[10] They dominated this region and occupied the territory at the time of European colonization. They considered it a sacred site within the Black Hills, which they call Pah Spa and ? Spa.[10]\\r\\nThe mountain was named Harney Peak in 1855 by American Lieutenant Gouverneur K. Warren in honor of US General William S. Harney, his commander in a regional military expedition. In punitive retaliation for other Sioux raids, in September 1855 Harney's forces killed Brul Sioux warriors, women and children in what Americans called the Battle of Blue Water Creek in Garden County, Nebraska.[6]\\r\\nHarney later commanded the United States military in the Black Hills area in the late 1870s.[11] The Lakota have tried to get the name of the peak changed for 50 years,[12] as Harney had massacred their people.[13]\\r\\nIn 2014 the Sioux renewed their effort to get the name changed, in an effort led by Basil Brave Heart of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. A Korean War veteran, he felt that Harney had not honored the military with his action.[6][13]\\r\\nSome Lakota requested state officials in 2015 to reinstate their original name Hinhan Kaga for the peak. The Lakota Council of the Pine Ridge Reservation and descendants of Black Elk, a noted medicine man, supported naming it for him, as the national wilderness area around the peak is named for the shaman.[12]\\r\\nHe became known beyond the Lakota in part through the book Black Elk Speaks (1932), written by John G. Neihardt from long talks with the shaman.[14][15] South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard opposed the name change, as did other state officials, and no action was taken in 2015.\\r\\nThe U.S. Board on Geographic Names officially changed the mountain's name from \\"Harney Peak\\" to \\"Black Elk Peak\\" on August 11, 2016, by a unanimous vote of 12ÿ0, with one abstention.[6][11] On August 18, 2016, Gov. Daugaard announced that the state would accept the new name.[16]\\r\\nHinhan Kaga and the Black Hills were protected within the Great Sioux Reservation established by the United States government in the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868; it covered most of the territory west of the Missouri River in South Dakota (the area now called West River). American settlement was concentrated east of the river, where there was more water for farming.\\r\\nThe first Americans believed to have reached the summit were a party led by General George Armstrong Custer in 1874, during the Black Hills expedition. He was looking for gold.[17] The federal government took back the Black Hills and another strip of land in a new treaty in 1877. More than a decade later, it broke up the Great Sioux Reservation in 1889 into five smaller reservations, the same year that North Dakota and South Dakota were admitted as states to the Union. The government made some 9 million acres of former Lakota land available for purchase for ranching and homesteading. Most American settlement in West River did not start until the early 20th century. The area attracted many European immigrants as well as migrants from the East.\\r\\nBlack Elk Peak is the site where Black Elk (Lakota Sioux) received his \\"Great Vision\\" when nine years old. He later became a medicine man known for his wisdom. Late in life, he returned to the peak accompanied by writer John Neihardt. Black Elk was sharing much of his life and philosophy with Neihardt through long talks translated by his son. Neihardt tried to express the medicine man's wisdom in his book Black Elk Speaks (1932).[note 1]\\r\\nNeihardt recorded Black Elk's words about his vision as follows:\\r\\n\\"I was standing on the highest mountain of them all, and round about beneath me was the whole hoop of the world,\\" he is quoted as saying. \\"And while I stood there I saw more than I can tell and I understood more than I saw; for I was seeing in a sacred manner the shapes of all things in the spirit, and the shape of all shapes as they must live together like one being.\\"[18]\\r\\nAmerican settlers used Black Elk Peak as a fire lookout tower in 1911, with a wood crate placed at the summit for a seat. In 1920, a 12'x12' wood structure was built, and it was expanded to 16'x16' the following year. The federal Civilian Conservation Corps enlisted local men and completed construction of a stone fire tower in 1938, one of numerous projects in the state during the Great Depression. The Harney Peak fire tower was last staffed in 1967.[19]\\r\\nA United States post office was operated at Black Elk Peak from 1936 until 1942, and again from 1945 until 1946.[20] The Harney Peak post office was reportedly one of the \\"most elevated post offices in the United States\\".[21]\\r\\nIn May 2015 the South Dakota Board of Geographic Names recommended renaming Harney Peak as Hinhan Kaga, to remove the name of a commander known for massacring Sioux women and children at the Battle of Blue Water Creek [22] and to honor the original Lakota name for the mountain.[9] At the end of the following month, the board reversed the recommendation that the peak be renamed saying that \\"there was no public consensus on a new name.\\"[22] The Lakota were divided on a preferred name, and Republican Governor Dennis Daugaard and some other Americans opposed any name change.[6]\\r\\nThe recommendation for renaming went to the federal US Board on Geographic Names.[23] The federal board acknowledged that the name was of concern to the Lakota, and its spokesman said, \\"In this case, the board felt that the name was derogatory or offensive, being that it was on a holy site of the Native Americans.\\"[6] In a decision published August 11, 2016, the United States Board on Geographic Names adopted the name \\"Black Elk Peak.\\"[24]\\r\\nThe summit can be reached from Sylvan Lake, Camp Remington, Highway 244, Palmer Creek Rd., Mount Rushmore, or Horse Thief Lake. From the trailhead at Sylvan Lake in Custer State Park, to the summit and back is about 7 miles (11?km).[4] This is the shortest, least strenuous, and most popular route.

CO2 is a major greenhouse gas and plays a vital role in regulating Earth's surface temperature through the greenhouse effect.[1] Carbon dioxide is an integral part of the carbon cycle, a biogeochemical cycle in which carbon is exchanged between the Earth's oceans, soil, rocks and the biosphere. Plants and other photoautotrophs use solar energy to produce carbohydrate from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water by photosynthesis. Almost all other organisms depend on carbohydrate derived from photosynthesis as their primary source of energy and carbon compounds.\\r\\nReconstructions show that concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere have varied from as high as 7,000 parts per million (ppm) during the Cambrian period about 500 million years ago to as low as 180 ppm during the Quaternary glaciation of the last two million years. Global annual mean CO2 concentration has increased by more than 45% since the start of the Industrial Revolution. The concentration was 280 ppm during the 10,000 years up to the mid-18th century,[2] increasing to 407 ppm as of mid-2017.[3][4] The present concentration is the highest in at least the past 800,000 years[5] and likely the highest in the past 20 million years.[6] The increase has been caused by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.[7] This increase of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere has produced the current episode of global warming. About 30ÿ40% of the CO2 released by humans into the atmosphere dissolves into oceans, rivers and lakes,[8][9] which has produced ocean acidification.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the past 400,000 years, CO2 concentrations have shown several cycles of variation from about 180 parts per million during the deep glaciations of the Holocene and Pleistocene to 280 parts per million during the interglacial periods. Each part per million by volume of CO2 in the atmosphere contains approximately 2.13 gigatonnes of carbon.[10] Currently CO2 constitutes about 0.041% (equal to 410 ppm) by volume of the atmosphere,[11][12] which corresponds to approximately 3200 gigatons of CO2, which includes approximately 870 gigatons of carbon. The global mean CO2 concentration is currently rising at a rate of approximately 2 ppm/year and accelerating.[13][14]\\r\\nFollowing the start of the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased to over 400 parts per million and continues to increase. The daily average concentration of atmospheric CO2 at Mauna Loa Observatory first exceeded 400 ppm on 10 May 2013.[15] This has caused the phenomenon of global warming.[16] The global average concentration of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere is currently about 0.04%,[17] or 400 parts per million by volume (ppm).[13][18] There is an annual fluctuation of about 3ÿ9 ppm which is negatively correlated with the Northern Hemisphere's growing season. The Northern Hemisphere dominates the annual cycle of CO2 concentration because it has much greater land area and plant biomass than the Southern Hemisphere. Concentrations reach a peak in May as the Northern Hemisphere spring greenup begins, and decline to a minimum in October, near the end of the growing season.[19]\\r\\nSince global warming is attributed to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases such as CO2, scientists closely monitor atmospheric CO2 concentrations and their impact on the present-day biosphere. At the scientific recording station in Mauna Loa, the concentration reached 400 ppm for the first time in May 2013,[15][20] although this concentration had already been reached in the Arctic in June 2012.[21] The National Geographic wrote that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is this high \\"for the first time in 55 years of measurementand probably more than 3 million years of Earth history.\\"[22] The current concentration may be the highest in the last 20 million years.[6]\\r\\nCarbon dioxide concentrations have varied widely over the Earth's 4.54 billion year history. Carbon dioxide is believed to have been present in Earth's first atmosphere, shortly after Earth's formation. Earth's second atmosphere emerged after the lighter gases, hydrogen and helium, escaped to space or like oxygen were bound up in molecules and is thought to have consisted largely of nitrogen, carbon dioxide and inert gases[which?] produced by outgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases[which?] produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by asteroids.[citation needed] The production of free oxygen by cyanobacterial photosynthesis eventually led to the oxygen catastrophe that ended Earth's second atmosphere and brought about the Earth's third atmosphere (the modern atmosphere) 2.4 billion years before the present. Carbon dioxide concentrations dropped from 7,000 parts per million during the Cambrian period about 500 million years ago to as low as 180 parts per million during the Quaternary glaciation of the last two million years.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn long timescales, atmospheric CO2 concentration is determined by the balance among geochemical processes including organic carbon burial in sediments, silicate rock weathering, and volcanism. The net effect of slight imbalances in the carbon cycle over tens to hundreds of millions of years has been to reduce atmospheric CO2. On a timescale of billions of years, such downward trend appears bound to continue indefinitely as occasional massive historical releases of buried carbon due to volcanism will become less frequent (as earth mantle cooling and progressive exhaustion of internal radioactive heat proceeds further). The rates of these processes are extremely slow; hence they are of no relevance to the atmospheric CO2 concentration over the next hundreds or thousands of years.\\r\\nIn billion-year timescales, it is predicted that plant, and therefore animal, life on land will die off altogether, since by that time most of the remaining carbon in the atmosphere will be sequestered underground, and natural releases of CO2 by radioactivity-driven tectonic activity will have continued to slow down.[27] The loss of plant life would also result in the eventual loss of oxygen. Some microbes are capable of photosynthesis at concentrations of CO2 of a few parts per million and so the last life forms would probably disappear finally due to the rising temperatures and loss of the atmosphere when the sun becomes a red giant some four billion years from now.[28]\\r\\nThe most direct method for measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations for periods before instrumental sampling is to measure bubbles of air (fluid or gas inclusions) trapped in the Antarctic or Greenland ice sheets. The most widely accepted of such studies come from a variety of Antarctic cores and indicate that atmospheric CO2 concentrations were about 260ÿ280 ppmv immediately before industrial emissions began and did not vary much from this level during the preceding 10,000 years.[29] The longest ice core record comes from East Antarctica, where ice has been sampled to an age of 800,000 years.[5] During this time, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has varied between 180ÿ210 ppm during ice ages, increasing to 280ÿ300 ppm during warmer interglacials.[30][31] The beginning of human agriculture during the current Holocene epoch may have been strongly connected to the atmospheric CO2 increase after the last ice age ended, a fertilization effect raising plant biomass growth and reducing stomatal conductance requirements for CO2 intake, consequently reducing transpiration water losses and increasing water usage efficiency.[32]\\r\\nVarious proxy measurements have been used to attempt to determine atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations millions of years in the past. These include boron and carbon isotope ratios in certain types of marine sediments, and the number of stomata observed on fossil plant leaves. While these measurements give much less precise estimates of carbon dioxide concentration than ice cores, there is evidence for very high CO2 volume concentrations between 200 and 150 million years ago of over 3,000 ppm, and between 600 and 400 million years ago of over 6,000 ppm.[6] In more recent times, atmospheric CO2 concentration continued to fall after about 60 million years ago. About 34 million years ago, the time of the EoceneÿOligocene extinction event and when the Antarctic ice sheet started to take its current form, CO2 is found to have been about 760 ppm,[33] and there is geochemical evidence that concentrations were less than 300 ppm by about 20 million years ago. Carbon dioxide decrease, with a tipping point of 600 ppm, was the primary agent forcing Antarctic glaciation.[34] Low CO2 concentrations may have been the stimulus that favored the evolution of C4 plants, which increased greatly in abundance between 7 and 5 million years ago.[35]\\r\\nAncient-Earth climate reconstruction is a vibrant field with numerous studies and reconstructions that sometimes reinforce one another and sometimes disagree with each other. Academically, one study disputed the claim of stable CO2 concentrations during the present interglacial of the last 10,000 years. Based on an analysis of fossil leaves, Wagner et al.[36] argued that CO2 levels during the last 7,000ÿ10,000 year period were significantly higher (~300 ppm) and contained substantial variations that may be correlated to climate variations. Others have disputed such claims, suggesting they are more likely to reflect calibration problems than actual changes in CO2.[37] Relevant to this dispute is the observation that Greenland ice cores often report higher and more variable CO2 values than similar measurements in Antarctica. However, the groups responsible for such measurements (e.g. H. J Smith et al.[38]) believe the variations in Greenland cores result from in situ decomposition of calcium carbonate dust found in the ice. When dust concentrations in Greenland cores are low, as they nearly always are in Antarctic cores, the researchers report good agreement between measurements of Antarctic and Greenland CO2 concentrations.\\r\\nEarths natural greenhouse effect makes life as we know it possible and carbon dioxide plays a significant role in providing for the relatively warm temperature that the planet enjoys. The greenhouse effect is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary atmosphere warms the planet's surface beyond the temperature it would have in the absence of its atmosphere.[39][40][41] Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's temperature would be about ?18?C (-0.4?F) [42][43] compared to Earth's actual surface temperature of approximately 14?C (57.2?F).[44]\\r\\nCarbon dioxide is believed to have played an important effect in regulating Earth's temperature throughout its 4.7 billion year history. Early in the Earth's life, scientists have found evidence of liquid water indicating a warm world even though the Sun's output is believed to have only been 70% of what it is today. It has been suggested by scientists that higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the early Earth atmosphere might help explain this faint young sun paradox. When Earth first formed, Earth's atmosphere may have contained more greenhouse gases and CO2 concentrations may have been higher, with estimated partial pressure as large as 1,000?kPa (10?bar), because there was no bacterial photosynthesis to reduce the gas to carbon compounds and oxygen. Methane, a very active greenhouse gas which reacts with oxygen to produce CO2 and water vapor, may have been more prevalent as well, with a mixing ratio of 10?4 (100 parts per million by volume).[45][46]\\r\\nThough water is responsible for most (about 36-70%) of the total greenhouse effect, the role of water vapor as a greenhouse gas depends on temperature. On earth, carbon dioxide is the most relevant direct anthropologically influenced greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is often mentioned in the context of its increased influence as a greenhouse gas since the pre-industrial (1750) era. In the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report the increase in CO2 was estimated to be responsible for 1.82 W{m2 of the 2.63 W{m2 change in radiative forcing on earth (about 70%).[49]\\r\\nThe concept of atmospheric CO2 increasing ground temperature was first published by Svante Arrhenius in 1896.[50] The increased radiative forcing due to increased CO2 in the earth's atmosphere is based on the physical properties of CO2 and the non-saturated absorption windows where CO2 absorbs outgoing long-wave energy.\\r\\nAtmospheric carbon dioxide plays an integral role in the Earth's carbon cycle whereby carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by some natural processes such as photosynthesis and deposition of carbonates, to form limestones for example, and added back to the atmosphere by other natural processes such as respiration and the acid dissolution of carbonate deposits. There are two broad carbon cycles on earth: the fast carbon cycle and the slow carbon cycle. The fast carbon cycle refers to movements of carbon between the environment and living things in the biosphere whereas the slow carbon cycle involves the movement of carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, soil, rocks and volcanism. Both carbon cycles are intrinsically interconnected and atmospheric gaseous carbon dioxide facilitates the carbon cycle.\\r\\nNatural sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide include volcanic outgassing, the combustion of organic matter, wildfires and the respiration processes of living aerobic organisms. Man-made sources of carbon dioxide include the burning of fossil fuels for heating, power generation and transport, as well as some industrial processes such as cement making. It is also produced by various microorganisms from fermentation and cellular respiration. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria convert carbon dioxide to carbohydrates by a process called photosynthesis. They gain the energy needed for this reaction from absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll and other pigments. Oxygen, produced as a by-product of photosynthesis, is released into the atmosphere and subsequently used for respiration by heterotrophic organisms and other plants, forming a cycle.\\r\\nMost sources of CO2 emissions are natural, and are balanced to various degrees by natural CO2 sinks. For example, the natural decay of organic material in forests and grasslands and the action of forest fires results in the release of about 439 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide every year, while new growth entirely counteracts this effect, absorbing 450 gigatonnes per year.[51] Although the initial carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the young Earth was produced by volcanic activity, modern volcanic activity releases only 130 to 230 megatonnes of carbon dioxide each year.[52] These natural sources are nearly balanced by natural sinks, physical and biological processes which remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. For example, some is directly removed from the atmosphere by land plants for photosynthesis and it is soluble in water forming carbonic acid. There is a large natural flux of CO2 into and out of the biosphere and oceans.[53] In the pre-industrial era these fluxes were largely in balance. Currently about 57% of human-emitted CO2 is removed by the biosphere and oceans.[54][55] From pre-industrial era to 2010, the terrestrial biosphere represented a net source of atmospheric CO2 prior to 1940, switching subsequently to a net sink.[55] The ratio of the increase in atmospheric CO2 to emitted CO2 is known as the airborne fraction (Keeling et al., 1995); this varies for short-term averages and is typically about 45% over longer (5 year) periods.[55] Estimated carbon in global terrestrial vegetation increased from approximately 740 billion tons in 1910 to 780 billion tons in 1990.[56]\\r\\nCarbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere is essential to life and to the present planetary biosphere. Over the course of Earth's geologic history CO2 concentrations have played a role in biological evolution. The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide as sources of electrons, rather than water.[57] Cyanobacteria appeared later, and the excess oxygen they produced contributed to the oxygen catastrophe,[58] which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. In recent geologic times, low CO2 concentrations below 600 parts per million might have been the stimulus that favored the evolution of C4 plants which increased greatly in abundance between 7 and 5 million years ago over plants that use the less efficient C3 metabolic pathway.[35] At current atmospheric pressures photosynthesis shuts down when atmospheric CO2 concentrations fall below 150 ppm and 200 ppm although some microbes can extract carbon from the air at much lower concentrations.[59][60] Today, the average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130?terawatts,[61][62][63] which is about six times larger than the current power consumption of human civilization.[64] Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100ÿ115 thousand million metric tonnes of carbon into biomass per year.[65][66]\\r\\nPhotosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs, which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from CO2 and water using energy from light. However, not all organisms that use light as a source of energy carry out photosynthesis, since photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than CO2, as a source of carbon.[67] In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This is called oxygenic photosynthesis. Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. However, there are some types of bacteria that carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis, which consumes CO2 but does not release oxygen.\\r\\nCarbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation. Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction, so photosynthesis needs to supply both a source of energy to drive this process, and the electrons needed to convert CO2 into a carbohydrate. This addition of the electrons is a reduction reaction. In general outline and in effect, photosynthesis is the opposite of cellular respiration, in which glucose and other compounds are oxidized to produce CO2 and water, and to release exothermic chemical energy to drive the organism's metabolism. However, the two processes take place through a different sequence of chemical reactions and in different cellular compartments.\\r\\nMost organisms that utilize photosynthesis to produce oxygen use visible light to do so, although at least three use shortwave infrared or, more specifically, far-red radiation.[68]\\r\\nA 1993 review of scientific greenhouse studies found that a doubling of CO2 concentration would stimulate the growth of 156 different plant species by an average of 37%. The amount of gain varied significantly by species, with some showing much greater gains, and a small number showing a loss. For example, a 1979 greenhouse study compared the dry weights of cotton and maize plants grown in different greenhouses, one with double the CO2 concentration of the other. In the enriched CO2 air, the dry weight of 40-day-old cotton plants doubled, but the dry weight of 30-day-old maize plants increased by only 20%.[69][70]\\r\\nBecause of concerns that greenhouse experiments might not adequately simulate the actual environment (such as competing plants), scientists developed Free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiments. In this procedure, plants are grown outdoors, and the CO2 concentration of the surrounding air is artificially elevated. FACE experiments, using generally lower CO2 levels than the greenhouse studies, showed lower gains in growth than greenhouse studies, with the gains depending heavily on the species under study. A 2005 review of 12 experiments at 475-600 ppm showed an average gain of 17% in crop yield, with legumes typically showing a greater response than other species, and C4 plants generally showing less. The review also stated that the reviewed experiments have their own limitations. The studied CO2 levels were lower, and most of the experiments were carried out in temperate regions.[71]\\r\\nThe Earth's oceans contain a large amount of CO2 in the form of bicarbonate and carbonate ions  much more than the amount in the atmosphere. The bicarbonate is produced in reactions between rock, water, and carbon dioxide. One example is the dissolution of calcium carbonate:\\r\\nReactions like this tend to buffer changes in atmospheric CO2. Since the right side of the reaction produces an acidic compound, adding CO2 on the left side decreases the pH of sea water, a process which has been termed ocean acidification (pH of the ocean becomes more acidic although the pH value remains in the alkaline range). Reactions between CO2 and non-carbonate rocks also add bicarbonate to the seas. This can later undergo the reverse of the above reaction to form carbonate rocks, releasing half of the bicarbonate as CO2. Over hundreds of millions of years, this has produced huge quantities of carbonate rocks.\\r\\nUltimately, most of the CO2 emitted by human activities will dissolve in the ocean;[72] however, the rate at which the ocean will take it up in the future is less certain. Even if equilibrium is reached, including dissolution of carbonate minerals, the increased concentration of bicarbonate and decreased or unchanged concentration of carbonate ion will give rise to a higher concentration of un-ionized carbonic acid and dissolved CO2. This, along with higher temperatures, would mean a higher equilibrium concentration of CO2 in the air.\\r\\nWhile CO2 absorption and release is always happening as a result of natural processes, the recent rise in CO2 levels in the atmosphere is known to be mainly due to human (anthropogenic) activity.[73] There are 4 ways human activity, especially fossil fuel burning, is known to have caused the rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 over the last few centuries. 1) Various national statistics accounting for fossil fuel consumption, combined with knowledge of how much atmospheric CO2 is produced per unit of fossil fuel (e.g. liter of gasoline).[74] 2) By examining the ratio of various carbon isotopes in the atmosphere.[73] The burning of long-buried fossil fuels releases CO2 containing carbon of different isotopic ratios to those of living plants, enabling distinction between natural and human-caused contributions to CO2 concentration. 3) Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the northern hemisphere, where most of the world's population lives (and emissions originate from), compared to the southern hemisphere. This difference has increased as anthropogenic emissions have increased.[75] 4) Atmospheric O2 levels are decreasing in earth's atmosphere as it reacts with the carbon in fossil fuels to form CO2.[76]\\r\\nBurning fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas is the leading cause of increased anthropogenic CO2; deforestation is the second major cause. In 2010, 9.14 gigatonnes of carbon (GtC, equivalent to 33.5 gigatonnes of CO2 or about 4.3 ppm in earth's atmosphere) were released from fossil fuels and cement production worldwide, compared to 6.15 GtC in 1990.[77] In addition, land use change contributed 0.87 GtC in 2010, compared to 1.45 GtC in 1990.[77] In 1997, human-caused Indonesian peat fires were estimated to have released between 13% and 40% of the average carbon emissions caused by the burning of fossil fuels around the world in a single year.[78][79][80] In the period 1751 to 1900, about 12 GtC were released as CO2 to the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels, whereas from 1901 to 2013 the figure was about 380 GtC.[81]\\r\\nAnthropogenic carbon emissions exceed the amount that can be taken up or balanced out by natural sinks.[86] As a result, carbon dioxide has gradually accumulated in the atmosphere, and as of 2013[update], its concentration is almost 43% above pre-industrial levels.[15][20] Various techniques have been proposed for removing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in carbon dioxide sinks. Currently about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels is not absorbed by vegetation and the oceans and remains in the atmosphere.[87]\\r\\nExcess CO2 emitted since the pre-industrial era is projected to remain in the atmosphere for centuries to millennia,[88] even after emissions stop. Even if human carbon dioxide emissions were to completely cease, atmospheric temperatures are not expected to decrease significantly for thousands of years.[89]\\r\\nGlobal fossil carbon emissions 1800ÿ2007.\\r\\nFalse-color image of smoke and ozone pollution from Indonesian fires, 1997.\\r\\nBiosphere CO2 flux in the northern hemisphere summer (NOAA Carbon Tracker).\\r\\nBiosphere CO2 flux in the northern hemisphere winter (NOAA Carbon Tracker).\\r\\nThe first reproducibly accurate measurements of atmospheric CO2 were from flask sample measurements made by Dave Keeling at Caltech in the 1950s.[90] A few years later in March 1958 the first ongoing measurements were started by Keeling at Mauna Loa. Measurements at Mauna Loa have been ongoing since then. Now measurements are made at many sites globally. Additional measurement techniques are also used as well. Many measurement sites are part of larger global networks. Global network data are often made publicly available on the conditions of proper acknowledgement according to the respective data user policies.\\r\\nThere are several surface measurement (including flasks and continuous in situ) networks including NOAA/ERSL,[91] WDCGG,[92] and RAMCES.[93] The NOAA/ESRL Baseline Observatory Network, and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Network [94] data are hosted at the CDIAC at ORNL. The World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG), part of GAW, data are hosted by the JMA. The Reseau Atmospherique de Mesure des Composes an Effet de Serre database (RAMCES) is part of IPSL.\\r\\nFrom these measurements, further products are made which integrate data from the various sources. These products also address issues such as data discontinuity and sparseness. GLOBALVIEW-CO2 is one of these products.[95]\\r\\nOngoing ground-based total column measurements began more recently. Column measurements typically refer to an averaged column amount denoted XCO2, rather than a surface only measurement. These measurements are made by the TCCON. These data are also hosted on the CDIAC, and made publicly available according to the data use policy.[96]\\r\\nSatellite measurements are also a recent addition to atmospheric XCO2 measurements. SCIAMACHY aboard ESA's ENVISAT made global column XCO2 measurements from 2002-2012. AIRS aboard NASAs Aqua satellite makes global XCO2 measurements and was launched shortly after ENVISAT in 2012. More recent satellites have significantly improved the data density and precision of global measurements. Newer missions have higher spectral and spatial resolutions. JAXA's GOSAT was the first dedicated GHG monitoring satellite to successfully achieve orbit in 2009. NASA's OCO-2 launched in 2014 was the second. Various other satellites missions to measure atmospheric XCO2 are planned.","input":"How much carbon dioxide do we put in the atmosphere?"},{"output":"Lyndon B. Johnson","context":"18 June 1966, AKL-44\\r\\nUSS Pueblo (AGER-2) is a Banner-class environmental research ship, attached to Navy intelligence as a spy ship, which was attacked and captured by North Korean forces on 23 January 1968, in what is known today as the \\"Pueblo incident\\" or alternatively, as the \\"Pueblo crisis\\".\\r\\nThe seizure of the U.S. Navy ship and its 83 crew members, one of whom was killed in the attack, came less than a week after President Lyndon B. Johnson's State of the Union address to the United States Congress, just a week before the start of the Tet Offensive in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, and only three days after 31 men of North Korea's KPA Unit 12 had crossed the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and killed 26 South Koreans in an attempt to attack the South Korean Blue House (executive mansion) in the capital Seoul. The taking of Pueblo and the abuse and torture of its crew during the subsequent 11-month prisoner drama became a major Cold War incident, raising tensions between the western democracies and the Soviet Union and China.\\r\\nNorth Korea stated that Pueblo deliberately entered their territorial waters 7.6 nautical miles (14?km) away from Ryo Island, and that the logbook shows that they intruded several times.[1] However, the United States maintains that the vessel was in international waters at the time of the incident and that any purported evidence supplied by North Korea to support its statements was fabricated.[2]\\r\\nPueblo, still held by North Korea today, officially remains a commissioned vessel of the United States Navy.[3] Since early 2013, the ship has been moored along the Potong River in Pyongyang, and used there as a museum ship at the Pyongyang Victorious War Museum for propaganda purposes.[4] Pueblo is the only ship of the U.S. Navy still on the commissioned roster currently being held captive.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship was launched at the Kewaunee Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Kewaunee, Wisconsin, on 16 April 1944, as the United States Army Freight and Passenger (FP) FP-344. The Army later redesignated the FP vessels as Freight and Supply changing the designation to FS-344.[6] The ship, commissioned at New Orleans on 7 April 1945, served as a Coast Guardÿmanned Army vessel used for training civilians for the Army. Her first commanding officer was Lt. J. R. Choate, USCGR, succeeded by Lt. J.G. Marvin B. Barker, USCGR, on 12 September 1945.[7] FS-344 was placed out of service in 1954.\\r\\nFS-344 was transferred to the United States Navy on 12 April 1966 and was renamed USS Pueblo (AKL-44) after Pueblo and Pueblo County, Colorado on 18 June of the same year.\\r\\nInitially, she served as a light cargo ship, but shortly after resuming service was converted to an intelligence gathering ship, or what is colloquially known as a \\"spy ship\\", and redesignated AGER-2 on 13 May 1967. \\r\\nOn 5 January 1968, Pueblo left U.S. Navy base Yokosuka, Japan, in transit to the U.S. naval base at Sasebo, Japan; from there she left on 11 January 1968, headed northward through the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of Japan. She left with specific orders to intercept and conduct surveillance of Soviet Union \\"Red Navy\\" activity in the Tsushima Strait and to gather signal and electronic intelligence from North Korea.[8] The declassified SIGAD for the National Security Agency (NSA) Direct Support Unit (DSU) from the Naval Security Group (NSG) on Pueblo during the patrol involved in the incident was USN-467Y.[9] AGER (Auxiliary General Environmental Research) denoted a joint Naval and National Security Agency (NSA) program.[10]\\r\\nAt 17:30 on 20 January 1968, a North Korean modified SO-1 class Soviet style submarine chaser passed within 4,000 yards (3.7?km) of Pueblo, which was about 15.4 miles (24.8?km) southeast of Mayang-do at a position 3947'N and 12828.5'E.[11]\\r\\nIn the afternoon of 22 January 1968, the two North Korean fishing trawlers Rice Paddy 1 and Rice Paddy 2 passed within 30 yards (27?m) of Pueblo. That day, a North Korean unit made an assassination attempt in the \\"Blue House\\" executive mansion against the South Korean President Park Chung-hee, but the crew of Pueblo were not informed.[11]\\r\\nAccording to the American account, the following day, 23 January, Pueblo was approached by a sub chaser and her nationality was challenged; Pueblo responded by raising the U.S. flag. The North Korean vessel then ordered it to stand down or be fired upon. Pueblo attempted to maneuver away, but was considerably slower than the sub chaser. Several warning shots were fired. Additionally, three torpedo boats appeared on the horizon and then joined in the chase and subsequent attack.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe attackers were soon joined by two MiG-21 fighters. A fourth torpedo boat and a second sub chaser appeared on the horizon a short time later. The ammunition on Pueblo was stored belowdecks, and her machine guns were wrapped in cold weather tarpaulins. The machine guns were unmanned, and no attempt was made to man them. An NSA report quotes the sailing order:\\r\\n(...) Defensive armament (machine guns) should be stowed or covered in such manner so that it does not cause unusual interest by surveyed units. It should be used only in the event of a threat to survival (...)\\r\\nand notes\\r\\nIn practice, it was discovered that, because of the temperamental adjustments of the firing mechanisms, the .50-caliber machine guns took at least ten minutes to activate. Only one crew member, with former army experience, had ever had any experience with such weapons, although members of the crew had received rudimentary instructions on the weapons immediately prior to the ship's deployment.[11]\\r\\nU.S. Navy authorities and the crew of Pueblo insist that before the capture, Pueblo was miles outside North Korean territorial waters. North Korea says the vessel was well within North Korean territory. The mission statement allowed her to approach within a nautical mile (1,852?m) of that limit. North Korea, however, describes a 50-nautical-mile (93?km) sea boundary even though international standards were 12 nautical miles (22?km) at the time.[12]\\r\\nThe North Korean vessels attempted to board Pueblo, but she was maneuvered to prevent this for over two hours. A sub chaser then opened fire with a 57?mm cannon, killing one member of the crew. The smaller vessels fired machine guns into Pueblo, which then signaled compliance and began destroying sensitive material. The volume of material on board was so great that it was impossible to destroy it all. An NSA report quotes Lieutenant Steve Harris, the officer in charge of Pueblo's Naval Security Group Command detachment:\\r\\n(...) we had retained on board the obsolete publications and had all good intentions of getting rid of these things but had not done so at the time we had started the mission. I wanted to get the place organized eventually and we had excessive numbers of copies on board (...)\\r\\nand concludes\\r\\nOnly a small percentage of the total classified material aboard the ship was destroyed.\\r\\nRadio contact between Pueblo and the Naval Security Group in Kamiseya, Japan, had been ongoing during the incident. As a result, Seventh Fleet command was fully aware of Pueblo's situation. Air cover was promised but never arrived. The Fifth Air Force had no aircraft on strip alert, and estimated a two to three-hour delay in launching aircraft. USS?Enterprise was located 510 nautical miles (940?km) south of Pueblo, yet its four F-4B aircraft on alert were not equipped for an air-to-surface engagement. Enterprise's captain estimated that 1.5 hours (90 minutes) were required to get the converted aircraft into the air.[11] By the time President Lyndon B. Johnson was awakened, Pueblo had been captured and any rescue attempt would have been futile.[citation needed]\\r\\nPueblo followed the North Korean vessels as ordered, but then stopped immediately outside North Korean waters. She was again fired upon, and a sailor, fireman Duane Hodges, was killed. The ship was finally boarded at 0555 UTC (2:55 pm local)[13] by men from a torpedo boat and a sub chaser. Crew members had their hands tied and were blindfolded, beaten, and prodded with bayonets. Once Pueblo was in North Korean territorial waters, she was boarded again, this time by high-ranking North Korean officials.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first official confirmation that the ship was in North Korean hands came five days later, 28 January 1968. Two days earlier a flight by a CIA A-12 Oxcart aircraft from the Project Black Shield squadron at Kadena, Okinawa flown by pilot Ronald \\"Jack\\" Layton made three high altitude high speed flights over North Korea. When the aircraft's films were processed in the United States they showed Pueblo to be in the Wonsan harbor area surrounded by two North Korean vessels.[14]\\r\\nThere was dissent among government officials in the U.S. regarding how to handle the situation. Rep. Mendel Rivers suggested the President issue an ultimatum for the return of Pueblo on penalty of nuclear attack, while Senator Gale McGee said the U.S. should wait for more information and not make \\"spasmodic response[s] to aggravating incidents\\".[15] According to Horace Busby, Special Assistant to President Johnson, the President's \\"reaction to the hostage taking was to work very hard here to keep down any demands for retaliation or any other attacks upon North Koreans\\", worried that rhetoric might result in the hostages being killed.[16]\\r\\nAlthough American officials at the time assumed the seizure of Pueblo had been directed by the Soviet Union, it has emerged in recent years that North Korea acted alone and the incident actually harmed North Korea's relations with most of the Eastern Bloc.[17]\\r\\nPueblo was taken into port at Wonsan and the crew was moved twice to POW camps. The crew reported upon release that they were starved and regularly tortured while in North Korean custody. This treatment allegedly turned worse[18] when the North Koreans realized that crewmen were secretly giving them \\"the finger\\" in staged propaganda photos.[19]\\r\\nCommander Lloyd M. Bucher was psychologically tortured, such as being put through a mock firing squad in an effort to make him confess. Eventually the Koreans threatened to execute his men in front of him, and Bucher relented and agreed to \\"confess to his and the crew's transgression.\\" Bucher wrote the confession since a \\"confession\\" by definition needed to be written by the confessor himself. They verified the meaning of what he wrote, but failed to catch the pun when he said \\"We paean the DPRK [North Korea]. We paean their great leader Kim Il Sung\\".[20][21] (Bucher pronounced \\"paean\\" as \\"pee on.\\")[22]\\r\\nNegotiations for the release of the crew took place at Panmunjom. At the same time, U.S. officials were concerned with conciliating the South Koreans, who expressed discontent about being left out of the negotiations. Richard A. Ericson, a political counselor for the American embassy in Seoul and operating officer for the Pueblo negotiations, notes in his oral history:\\r\\nThe South Koreans were absolutely furious and suspicious of what we might do. They anticipated that the North Koreans would try to exploit the situation to the ROK's disadvantage in every way possible, and they were rapidly growing distrustful of us and losing faith in their great ally. Of course, we had this other problem of how to ensure that the ROK would not retaliate for the Blue House Raid and to ease their growing feelings of insecurity. They began to realize that the DMZ was porous and they wanted more equipment and aid. So, we were juggling a number of problems.[23]\\r\\nHe also noted how the meetings at Panmunjom were usually unproductive, due to the particular negotiating style of the North Koreans:\\r\\nAs one example, we would go up with a proposal of some sort on the release of the crew and they would be sitting there with a card catalog... If the answer to the particular proposal we presented wasnt in the cards, they would say something that was totally unresponsive and then go off and come back to the next meeting with an answer that was directed to the question. But there was rarely an immediate answer. That happened all through the negotiations. Their negotiators obviously were never empowered to act or speak on the basis of personal judgment or general instructions. They always had to defer a reply and presumably they went over it up in Pyongyang and passed it around and then decided on it. Sometimes we would get totally nonsensical responses if they didnt have something in the card file that corresponded to the proposal at hand.[23]\\r\\nEricson and George Newman, the Deputy Chief of Mission in Seoul, wrote a telegram for the State Department in February 1968, predicting how the negotiations would play out:\\r\\nWhat we said in effect was this: If you are going to do this thing at Panmunjom, and if your sole objective is to get the crew back, you will be playing into North Korea's hands and the negotiations will follow a clear and inevitable path. You are going to be asked to sign a document that the North Koreans will have drafted. They will brook no changes. It will set forth their point of view and require you to confess to everything they accuse you of... If you allow them to, they will take as much time as they feel they need to squeeze every damn thing they can get out of this situation in terms of their propaganda goals, and they will try to exploit this situation to drive a wedge between the U.S. and the ROK. Then when they feel they have accomplished all they can, and when we have agreed to sign their document of confession and apology, they will return the crew. They will not return the ship. This is the way it is going to be because this is the way it has always been.[23]\\r\\nFollowing an apology, a written admission by the U.S. that Pueblo had been spying, and an assurance that the U.S. would not spy in the future, the North Korean government decided to release the 82 remaining crew members, although the written apology was preceded by an oral statement that it was done only to secure the release.[24] On 23 December 1968, the crew was taken by buses to the DMZ border with South Korea and ordered to walk south one by one across the \\"Bridge of No Return\\". Exactly eleven months after being taken prisoner, the Captain led the long line of crewmen, followed at the end by the Executive Officer, Lieutenant Ed Murphy, the last man across the bridge. The U.S. then verbally retracted the ransom admission, apology, and assurance. Meanwhile, the North Koreans blanked out the paragraph above the signature which read: \\"and this hereby receipts for eighty two crewmen and one corpse\\".[clarification needed]\\r\\nBucher and all the officers and crew subsequently appeared before a Navy Court of Inquiry. A court-martial was recommended for the CO and the Officer in Charge of the Research Department, Lt. Steve Harris for surrendering without a fight and for failing to destroy classified material, but the Secretary of the Navy, John Chafee, rejected the recommendation, stating, \\"They have suffered enough.\\" Commander Bucher was never found guilty of any indiscretions and continued his Navy career until retirement.[25]\\r\\nIn 1970, Bucher published an autobiographical account of the USS Pueblo incident entitled Bucher: My Story.[26] Bucher died in San Diego on 28 January 2004, at the age of 76. James Kell, a former sailor under his command, suggested that the injuries suffered by Bucher during his time in North Korea contributed to his death.[27]\\r\\nThe USS Pueblo is still held by North Korea. In October 1999, it was towed from Wonsan on the east coast, around the Korean Peninsula, to the port of Nampo on the west coast. This required moving the vessel through international waters, and was undertaken just before the visit of U.S. presidential envoy James Kelly to the capital Pyongyang. After the stop at the Nampo shipyard Pueblo was relocated to Pyongyang and moored on the Taedong River near the spot that the General Sherman incident is believed to have taken place. In late 2012 Pueblo was moved again to the Botong River in Pyongyang next to a new addition to the Fatherland Liberation War Museum.[4]\\r\\nToday, Pueblo remains the second-oldest commissioned ship in the U.S. Navy, behind the USS?Constitution (\\"Old Ironsides\\"). Pueblo is one of only a few American ships to have been captured since the wars in Tripoli.\\r\\nReverse engineering of communications devices on the Pueblo allowed the North Koreans to share knowledge with the Soviet Union that led to the replication of those communications devices. This allowed the two nations access to the US Navy's communication systems until the late 1980s when the US Navy revised those systems. The seizure of the Pueblo followed soon after US Navy warrant officer John Anthony Walker introduced himself to Soviet authorities, setting up the Walker spy ring. It has been argued that the seizure of the Pueblo was executed specifically to capture the encryption devices aboard. Without them, it was difficult for the Soviets to make full use of Walker's information.[28][29][30]\\r\\nDocuments released from National Archives of Romania suggest it was the Chinese rather than the Soviets who actively encouraged the reopening of hostilities in Korea during 1968, promising the DPRK vast material support should hostilities in Korea resume.[citation needed] Together with Blue House Raid, the Pueblo incident turned out to be part of an increasing divergence between the Soviet leadership and the DPRK. Fostering a resumption of hostilities in Korea, allegedly, was seen in Beijing as a way to mend relations between North Korea and China, and pull North Korea back in the Chinese sphere of influence in the context of the Sino-Soviet split. After the (then secret) diplomatic efforts of the Soviets to have the American crew released fell on deaf ears in Pyongyang, Leonid Brezhnev publicly denounced DPRK's actions at the 8th plenary session of the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.[31] In contrast, the Chinese (state controlled) press published declarations supportive of DPRK's actions in the Pueblo incident.[32]\\r\\nFurthermore, Soviet archives reveal that the Soviet leadership was particularly displeased that the North Korean leader had contradicted the assurances he previously gave Moscow that he would avoid a military escalation in Korea. Previously secret documents suggest the Soviets were surprised by the Pueblo incident, first learning of it in the press. The same documents reveal that the North Koreans also kept the Soviets completely in the dark regarding ongoing negotiations with the Americans for the crew's release, which was another bone of contention. The Soviet reluctance at a reopening of hostilities in Korea was partly motivated by the fact that they had a 1961 treaty with North Korea that obliged them to intervene in case the latter got attacked. Brezhnev however had made it clear in 1966 that just as in the case of the similar treaty they had with China, the Soviets were prepared to ignore it rather than go to all-out war with the United States.[33]:12-15\\r\\nGiven that Chinese and North Korean archives surrounding the incident remain secret, Kim Il Sung's intentions cannot be known with certainty. The Soviets revealed however that Kim sent a letter to Alexei Kosygin on 31 January 1968 demanding further military and economic aid, which was interpreted by the Soviets as the price they would have to pay to restrain Kim's bellicosity. Consequently, Kim was personally invited to Moscow, but he refused to go in person owing to \\"increased defense preparations\\" he had to personally attend to, sending instead his defense minister, Kim Chang-bong, who arrived on 26 February 1968. During a long meeting with Brezhnev, the Soviet leader made it clear that they were not willing to go to war with the United States, but agreed to an increase in subsidies for the DPRK, which did happen in subsequent years.[33]:15-18\\r\\nWith Major General Pak Chung Kuk representing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral John Victor Smith representing the United States until April 1968, at which point he is replaced by U.S. Army Major General Gilbert H. Woodward. Timeline and quotations are taken from Matter of Accountability by Trevor Armbrister.[34]\\r\\nPueblo is a tourist attraction in Pyongyang, North Korea since being moved to the Taedong River.[35] Pueblo used to be anchored at the spot where it is believed the General Sherman incident took place in 1866. In late November 2012 Pueblo was moved from the Taedong river dock to a casement on the Botong river next to the new Fatherland War of Liberation Museum. The ship was renovated and made open to tourists with an accompanying video[36] of the North Korean perspective in late July 2013. To commemorate the anniversary of the Korean War, the ship had a new layer of paint added.[37] As of April 2015, the museum is moored and on display at the Pyongyang Victorious War Museum. Visitors are allowed to board the ship and see its secret code room and crew artifacts.[38]\\r\\nThe museum's position is 3902.26 N 12544.23 E\\r\\nDuring an August 2005 diplomatic session in North Korea, former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Donald Gregg received verbal indications from high-ranking North Korean officials that the state would be willing to repatriate Pueblo to United States authorities, on the condition that a prominent U.S. government official, such as the Secretary of State, come to Pyongyang for high level talks. While the U.S. government has publicly stated on several occasions that the return of the still commissioned Navy vessel is a priority, the current overall situation of U.S. and North Korean relations makes such an official state visit unlikely.[39]\\r\\nFormer Pueblo crew members William Thomas Massie, Dunnie Richard Tuck, Donald Raymond McClarren, and Lloyd Bucher sued the North Korean government for the abuse they suffered at its hands during their captivity.

The Olympic Games (Ancient?Greek: ??ϫ Olympia[1][2][3][4][5][6] \\"the Olympics\\" also Ancient?Greek: ??? Olympias[4][5][6][7] \\"the Olympiad\\") were a series of athletic competitions among representatives of city-states and one of the Panhellenic Games of Ancient Greece. They were held in honor of Zeus, and the Greeks gave them a mythological origin. The first Olympics is traditionally dated to 776 BC.[8] They continued to be celebrated when Greece came under Roman rule, until the emperor Theodosius I suppressed them in 393?AD as part of the campaign to impose Christianity as the State religion of Rome. The games were held every four years, or olympiad, which became a unit of time in historical chronologies.\\r\\nDuring the celebration of the games, an Olympic Truce was enacted so that athletes could travel from their cities to the games in safety. The prizes for the victors were olive leaf wreaths or crowns. The games became a political tool used by city-states to assert dominance over their rivals. Politicians would announce political alliances at the games, and in times of war, priests would offer sacrifices to the gods for victory. The games were also used to help spread Hellenistic culture throughout the Mediterranean. The Olympics also featured religious celebrations. The statue of Zeus at Olympia was counted as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Sculptors and poets would congregate each olympiad to display their works of art to would-be patrons.\\r\\nThe ancient Olympics had fewer events than the modern games, and only freeborn Greek men were allowed to participate,[9] although there were victorious women chariot owners. As long as they met the entrance criteria, athletes from any Greek city-state and kingdom were allowed to participate, although the Hellanodikai, the officials in charge, allowed king Alexander I of Macedon to participate in the games only after he had proven his Greek ancestry.[10][11] The games were always held at Olympia rather than moving between different locations as is the practice with the modern Olympic Games.[12] Victors at the Olympics were honored, and their feats chronicled for future generations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the Greeks, it was important to root the Olympic Games in mythology.[13] During the time of the ancient games their origins were attributed to the gods, and competing legends persisted as to who actually was responsible for the genesis of the games.[14] These origin traditions have become nearly impossible to untangle, yet a chronology and patterns have arisen that help people understand the story behind the games.[15]\\r\\nThe earliest myths regarding the origin of the games are recounted by the Greek historian, Pausanias. According to the story, the dactyl Heracles (not to be confused with the son of Zeus and the Roman god Hercules) and four of his brothers, Paeonaeus, Epimedes, Iasius and Idas, raced at Olympia to entertain the newborn Zeus. He crowned the victor with an olive tree wreath (which thus became a peace symbol), which also explains the four year interval, bringing the games around every fifth year (counting inclusively).[16][17] The other Olympian gods (so named because they lived permanently on Mount Olympus) would also engage in wrestling, jumping and running contests.[18]\\r\\nAnother myth of the origin of the games is the story of Pelops, a local Olympian hero. The story of Pelops begins with Oenomaus, the king of Pisa, Greece, who had a beautiful daughter named Hippodamia. According to an oracle, the king would be killed by her husband. Therefore, he decreed that any young man who wanted to marry his daughter was required to drive away with her in his chariot, and Oenomaus would follow in another chariot, and spear the suitor if he caught up with them. Now, the king's chariot horses were a present from the god Poseidon and were therefore supernaturally fast. Pelops was a very handsome young man and the king's daughter fell in love with him. Before the race, she persuaded her father's charioteer Myrtilus to replace the bronze axle pins of the king's chariot with wax ones. Naturally, during the race the wax melted and the king fell from his chariot and was killed. At the same time the king's palace was struck by lightning and reduced to ashes, save for one wooden pillar that was revered in the Altis for centuries, and stood near what was to be the site of the temple of Zeus. Pelops was proclaimed the winner and married Hippodamia. After his victory, Pelops organized chariot races as thanksgiving to the gods and as funeral games in honor of King Oenomaus, in order to be purified of his death. It was from this funeral race held at Olympia that the beginnings of the Olympic Games were inspired. Pelops became a great king, a local hero, and he gave his name to the Peloponnese.\\r\\nOne other myth, this one occurring after the aforementioned myth, is attributed to Pindar. He claims the festival at Olympia involved Heracles, the son of Zeus. The story goes that after completing his labors, Heracles established an athletic festival to honor his father.\\r\\nThe games of previous millennia were discontinued and then revived by Lycurgus of Sparta, Iphitos of Elis, and Cleisthenes of Pisa at the behest of the Oracle of Delphi who claimed that the people had strayed from the gods, which had caused a plague and constant war. Restoration of the games would end the plague, usher in a time of peace, and signal a return to a more traditional lifestyle.[19] The patterns that emerge from these myths are that the Greeks believed the games had their roots in religion, that athletic competition was tied to worship of the gods, and the revival of the ancient games was intended to bring peace, harmony and a return to the origins of Greek life.[20]\\r\\nSince these myths were documented by historians like Pausanias, who lived during the reign of Marcus Aurelius in the 160?AD, it is likely that these stories are more fable than fact. It was often supposed that the origins of many aspects of the Olympics date to funeral games of the Mycenean period and later.[21] Alternatively, the games were thought to derive from some kind of vegetation magic or from initiation ceremonies. The most recent theory traces the origins of the games to large game hunting and related animal ceremonialism.[22]\\r\\nThe Olympic games were held to be one of the two central rituals in Ancient Greece, the other being the much older religious festival, the Eleusinian Mysteries.[23]\\r\\nThe games started in Olympia, Greece, in a sanctuary site for the Greek deities near the towns of Elis and Pisa (both in Elis on the peninsula of Peloponnesos). The first games began as an annual foot race of young women in competition for the position of the priestess for the goddess, Hera,[24] and a second race was instituted for a consort for the priestess who would participate in the religious traditions at the temple.[25]\\r\\nThe Heraea Games, the first recorded competition for women in the Olympic Stadium, were held as early as the sixth century BC. It originally consisted of foot races only, as did the competition for males. Some texts, including Pausanias's Description of Greece, c. AD?175, state that Hippodameia gathered a group known as the \\"Sixteen Women\\" and made them administrators of the Heraea Games, out of gratitude for her marriage to Pelops. Other texts related to the Elis and Pisa conflict indicate that the \\"Sixteen Women\\" were peacemakers from Pisa and Elis and, because of their political competence, became administrators of the Heraea. Being the consort of Hera in Classical Greek mythology, Zeus was the father of the deities in the pantheon of that era. The Sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia housed a 13-metre-high (43?ft) statue in ivory and gold of Zeus that had been sculpted by Phidias circa 445?BC. This statue was one of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World. By the time of the Classical Greek culture, in the fifth and fourth centuries BC, the games were restricted to male participants.\\r\\nThe historian Ephorus, who lived in the fourth century BC, is one potential candidate for establishing the use of Olympiads to count years, although credit for codifying this particular epoch usually falls to Hippias of Elis, to Eratosthenes, or even to Timaeus, whom Eratosthenes may have imitated.[26][27][28] The Olympic Games were held at four-year intervals, and later, the ancient historians' method of counting the years even referred to these games, using the term Olympiad for the period between two games. Previously, the local dating systems of the Greek states were used (they continued to be used by everyone except the historians), which led to confusion when trying to determine dates. For example, Diodorus states that there was a solar eclipse in the third year of the 113th Olympiad, which must be the eclipse of 316?BC. This gives a date of (mid-summer) 765?BC for the first year of the first Olympiad.[29] Nevertheless, there is disagreement among scholars as to when the games began.[30]\\r\\nThe only competition held then was, according to the later Greek traveller Pausanias who wrote in 175?AD, the stadion race, a race over about 190 metres (620?ft), measured after the feet of Hercules. The word stadium is derived from this foot race.\\r\\nThe Greek tradition of athletic nudity (gymnos)[31] was introduced in 720?BC, either by the Spartans or by the Megarian Orsippus, and this was adopted early in the Olympics as well.\\r\\nSeveral groups fought over control of the sanctuary at Olympia, and hence the games, for prestige and political advantage. Pausanias later writes that in 668?BC, Pheidon of Argos was commissioned by the town of Pisa to capture the sanctuary from the town of Elis, which he did and then personally controlled the games for that year. The next year, Elis regained control.\\r\\nThe Olympic Games were part of the Panhellenic Games, four separate games held at two- or four-year intervals, but arranged so that there was at least one set of games every year. The Olympic Games were more important and more prestigious than the Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian Games.\\r\\nThe games were in decline for many years but continued past 385 AD, by which time flooding and earthquakes had damaged the buildings and invasions by barbarians had reached Olympia.[32] In 394 Theodosius I banned all pagan festivals, but archeological evidence indicates that some games were still held.[33]\\r\\nThe ancient Olympics were as much a religious festival as an athletic event. The games were held in honor of the Greek god Zeus, and on the middle day of the games, 100 oxen would be sacrificed to him.[12] Over time Olympia, site of the games, became a central spot for the worship of the head of the Greek pantheon and a temple, built by the Greek architect Libon was erected on the mountaintop. The temple was one of the largest Doric temples in Greece.[12] The sculptor Pheidias created a statue of the god made of gold and ivory. It stood 42 feet (13?m) tall. It was placed on a throne in the temple. The statue became one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.[12] As the historian Strabo put it,\\r\\n\\"... the glory of the temple persisted?... on account both of the festal assembly and of the Olympian Games, in which the prize was a crown and which were regarded as sacred, the greatest games in the world. The temple was adorned by its numerous offerings, which were dedicated there from all parts of Greece.\\"[12]\\r\\nArtistic expression was a major part of the games. Sculptors, poets, painters and other artisans would come to the games to display their works in what became an artistic competition. Sculptors created works like Myron's Diskobolos or Discus Thrower. Their aim was to highlight natural human movement and the shape of muscles and the body. Poets would be commissioned to write poems in praise of the Olympic victors. Such victory songs or epinicians, were passed on from generation to generation and many of them have lasted far longer than any other honor made for the same purpose.[34] Pierre de Coubertin, one of the founders of the modern Olympic Games, wanted to fully imitate the ancient Olympics in every way. Included in his vision was an artistic competition modeled on the ancient Olympics and held every four years, during the celebration of the Olympic Games.[35] His desire came to fruition at the Olympics held in Athens in 1896.[36]\\r\\nPower in ancient Greece became centered around the city-state in the 8th?century BC.[37] The city-state was a population center organized into a self-contained political entity.[38] These city-states often lived in close proximity to each other, which created competition for limited resources. Though conflict between the city-states was ubiquitous, it was also in their self-interest to engage in trade, military alliances and cultural interaction.[39] The city-states had a dichotomous relationship with each other: On one hand, they relied on their neighbors for political and military alliances, while on the other they competed fiercely with those same neighbors for vital resources.[40] The Olympic Games were established in this political context and served as a venue for representatives of the city-states to peacefully compete against each other.[41]\\r\\nIn the first 200 years of the games' existence, they only had regional religious importance. Only Greeks in proximity to the mountain competed in these early games. This is evidenced by the dominance of Peloponnesian athletes in the victors' rolls.[42] The spread of Greek colonies in the 5th and 6th centuries BC is repeatedly linked to successful Olympic athletes. For example, Pausanias recounts that Cyrene was founded c. 630?BC by settlers from Thera with Spartan support. The support Sparta gave was primarily the loan of three-time Olympic champion Chionis. The appeal of settling with an Olympic champion helped to populate the colonies and maintain cultural and political ties with the city-states near Olympia. Thus, Hellenic culture and the games spread while the primacy of Olympia persisted.[43]\\r\\nThe games faced a serious challenge during the Peloponnesian War, which primarily pitted Athens against Sparta, but, in reality, touched nearly every Hellenic city-state.[44] The Olympics were used during this time to announce alliances and offer sacrifices to the gods for victory.[12][45]\\r\\nDuring the Olympic Games, a truce, or ekecheiria was observed. Three runners, known as spondophoroi were sent from Elis to the participant cities at each set of games to announce the beginning of the truce.[46] During this period, armies were forbidden from entering Olympia and legal disputes and the use of the death penalty were forbidden. The truce was primarily designed to allow athletes and visitors to travel safely to the games and was, for the most part, observed.[46] Thucydides wrote of a situation when the Spartans were forbidden from attending the games, and the violators of the truce were fined 2,000 minae for assaulting the city of Lepreum during the period of the ekecheiria. The Spartans disputed the fine and claimed that the truce had not yet taken hold.[45][47]\\r\\nWhile a martial truce was observed by all participating city-states, no such reprieve from conflict existed in the political arena. The Olympic Games evolved the most influential athletic and cultural stage in ancient Greece, and arguably in the ancient world.[48] As such the games became a vehicle for city-states to promote themselves. The result was political intrigue and controversy. For example, Pausanias, a Greek historian, explains the situation of the athlete Sotades,\\r\\n\\"Sotades at the ninety-ninth Festival was victorious in the long race and proclaimed a Cretan, as in fact he was. But at the next Festival he made himself an Ephesian, being bribed to do so by the Ephesian people. For this act he was banished by the Cretans.\\"[12]\\r\\nApparently starting with just a single foot race, the program gradually increased to twenty-three contests, although no more than twenty featured at any one Olympiad.[49] Participation in most events was limited to male athletes except for women who were allowed to take part by entering horses in the equestrian events. Youth events are recorded as starting in 632 BC. Our knowledge of how the events were performed primarily derives from the paintings of athletes found on many on vases, particularly those of the Archaic and Classical periods.[50]\\r\\nThe only event recorded at the first thirteen games was the stade, a straight-line sprint of just over 192 metres.[51] The diaulos (lit. \\"double pipe\\"), or two-stade race, is recorded as being introduced at the 14th Olympiad in 724 BC. It is thought that competitors ran in lanes marked out with lime or gypsum for the length of a stade then turned around separate posts (kampteres), before returning to the start line.[52] Xenophanes wrote that \\"Victory by speed of foot is honored above all.\\"\\r\\nA third foot race, the dolichos (\\"long race\\"), was introduced in the next Olympiad. Accounts of the race's distance differ, it seems to have been from twenty to twenty-four laps of the track, around 7.5?km to 9?km, although it may have been lengths rather than laps and thus half as far.[53][54]\\r\\nThe last running event added to the Olympic program was the hoplitodromos, or \\"Hoplite race\\", introduced in 520 BC and traditionally run as the last race of the games. Competitors ran either a single or double diaulos (approximately 400 or 800 metres) in full military armour.[55] The hoplitodromos was based on a war tactic of soldiers running in full armor to surprise the enemy.\\r\\nWrestling (pale) is recorded as being introduced at the 18th Olympiad. Three throws were necessary for win. A throw was counted if the body, hip, back or shoulder (and possibly knee) touched the ground. If both competitors fell nothing was counted. Unlike its modern counterpart Greco-Roman wrestling, it is likely that tripping was allowed.[56]\\r\\nBoxing (pygmachia) was first listed in 688 BC,[57] the boys event sixty years later. The laws of boxing were ascribed to the first Olympic champion Onomastus of Smyrna.[58] It appears body-blows were either not permitted or not practised.[59][60] The Spartans, who claimed to have invented boxing, quickly abandoned it and did not take part in boxing competitions.[58] At first the boxers wore himantes (sing. himas), long leather strips which were wrapped around their hands.[57]\\r\\nThe pankration was introduced in the 33rd Olympiad (648 BC).[61] Boys' pankration became an Olympic event in 200 BC, in the 145th Olympiad.[62] As well as techniques from boxing and wrestling, athletes used kicks,[63] locks, and chokes on the ground. Although the only prohibitions were against biting and gouging, the pankration was regarded as less dangerous than boxing.[64]\\r\\nOne of the most popular events, Pindar wrote eight odes praising victors of the pankration.[65] A famous event in the sport was the posthumous victory of Arrhichion of Phigaleia who \\"expired at the very moment when his opponent acknowledged himself beaten.\\"[66][67]\\r\\nThe pentathlon was a combined competition in five events: running, long jump, discus throw, javelin throw and wrestling.[68] The pentathlon is said to have first appeared at 18th Olympiad in 708 BC.[69] The competition was held on single day,[70] but it is not known how the victor was decided,[71][72] or in what order the events occurred,[73] except that it finished with the wrestling.[74]\\r\\nEquestrian events, otherwise known as horse racing, were the most prestigious competitions in the games, due to only the wealthy being able to afford the maintenance and transportation of horses. These races consisted of different events: the four-horse chariot, the two-horse chariot, and the horse with rider who was hand picked by the owner. The four-horse chariot was the first equestrian event, introduced in 680 BC. How this worked, were, two of the horses were harnessed under a Yoke in the middle, and the two outer horses were attached with a rope. [75] The two-horse chariot was later introduced at Olympia at 408 BC. [76] The horse with rider competition on the other hand, was introduced in 648 BC. In this race, Greeks didn't use saddles or stirrups, so they required good grip and balance. [77]\\r\\nIn 67 AD, the Roman Emperor Nero competed in the chariot race at Olympia. Nero was thrown from his chariot and was not able to finish the race, but Nero was declared the winner on the basis that Nero would have won if he finished the race.[78]\\r\\nAthletic festivals under the name of \\"Olympic games\\", named in imitation of the original festival at Olympia, were established over time in various places all over the Greek world. Some of these are only known to us by inscriptions and coins; but others, as the Olympic festival at Antioch, obtained great celebrity. After these Olympic festivals had been established in several places, the great Olympic festival itself was sometimes designated in inscriptions by the addition of Pisa.[84]","input":"When was the first olympic games held in ancient greece?"},{"output":"8,569","context":"Detroit Lakes is a city in the State of Minnesota and the county seat of Becker County.

This is the reproductive method of most fish, amphibians, reptiles, all birds, and the monotremes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn traditional usage, most insects, molluscs, and arachnids are also described as oviparous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe traditional modes of reproduction include oviparity, taken to be the ancestral condition, traditionally where either unfertilised oocytes or fertilised eggs are spawned, and viviparity traditionally including any mechanism where young are born live, or where the development of the young is supported by either parent in or on any part of their body.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the biologist Thierry Lod recently divided the traditional category of oviparous reproduction into two modes that he named ovuliparity and (true) oviparity respectively.

The narrow land bridge between North and South America houses the Panama Canal, a water passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The earliest European colonists recognized this potential, and several proposals for a canal were made.[1]\\r\\nBy the late nineteenth century, technological advances and commercial pressure allowed construction to begin in earnest. Noted canal engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps led an initial attempt by France to build a sea-level canal. Beset by cost overruns due to the severe underestimation of the difficulties in excavating the rugged Panama land, heavy personnel losses in Panama due to tropical diseases, and political corruption in France surrounding the financing of the massive project, the project succeeded in only partially completing the canal.\\r\\nInterest in a U.S.-led canal effort picked up as soon as France abandoned the project. Initially, the Panama site was politically unfavorable in the U.S. for a variety of reasons, including the taint of the failed French efforts and the Colombian government's unfriendly attitude towards the U.S. continuing the project. The U.S. first sought to construct a completely new canal through Nicaragua instead.\\r\\nFrench engineer and financier Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla played a key role in changing U.S. attitudes. Bunau-Varilla had a large stake in the failed French canal company, and stood to make money on his investment only if the Panama Canal was completed. Extensive lobbying of U.S. lawmakers coupled with his support of a nascent independence movement among the Panamanian people led to a simultaneous revolution in Panama and the negotiation of the HayÿBunau-Varilla Treaty which secured both independence for Panama and the right for the U.S. to lead a renewed effort to construct the canal.\\r\\nThe Panama Canal continues to be a viable commercial venture and a vital link in world shipping. The 2007 Panama Canal expansion project began commercial operation on 26 June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger Post-Panamax and New Panamax ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the original locks could accommodate.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of a canal across Central America was revived during the early 19th century. In 1819, the Spanish government authorized the construction of a canal and the creation of a company to build it.\\r\\nAlthough the project stalled for some time, a number of surveys were made between 1850 and 1875. They indicated that the two most-favorable routes were across Panama (then part of Colombia) and Nicaragua, with a third route across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico another option. The Nicaraguan route was surveyed.\\r\\nAfter the 1869 completion of the Suez Canal, France thought that an apparently-similar project to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans could be carried out with little difficulty. In 1876 an international company, La Socit internationale du Canal interocanique, was created to undertake its construction; two years later, it obtained a concession from the Colombian government (since Panama was a Colombian province) to dig a canal across the isthmus.\\r\\nFerdinand de Lesseps, who was in charge of the Suez Canal construction, headed the project. His enthusiastic leadership and his reputation as the man who had built the Suez Canal persuaded speculators and ordinary citizens to invest nearly $400?million in the project.\\r\\nHowever, despite his previous success de Lesseps was not an engineer. The Suez Canal, essentially a ditch dug through a flat, sandy desert, presented few challenges. Although Central America's mountainous spine has a low point in Panama, it is still 110 meters (360.9?ft) above sea level at its lowest crossing point. The sea-level canal proposed by de Lesseps would require a great deal of excavation through a variety of rock, rather than Suez' sand.\\r\\nLess-obvious barriers were the rivers crossing the canal, particularly the Chagres (which flows strongly during the rainy season). Since the water would be a hazard to shipping if it drained into the canal, a sea-level canal would require the river's diversion.\\r\\nThe most serious problem was tropical disease, particularly malaria and yellow fever, whose methods of transmission were unknown at the time. The legs of hospital beds were placed in cans of water to keep insects from crawling up them, but the stagnant water was an ideal breeding place for mosquitoes (carriers of the diseases).\\r\\nThe project was plagued by a lack of engineering expertise. In May 1879, an international engineering congress led by de Lesseps convened in Paris. Of its 136 delegates, only 42 were engineers; the others were speculators, politicians and friends of de Lesseps.\\r\\nHe was convinced that a sea-level canal, dug through the mountainous spine of Central America, could be completed at least as easily as the Suez Canal. The engineering congress estimated the project's cost at $214 million; on February 14, 1880, an engineering commission revised the estimate to $168.6 million. De Lesseps reduced this estimate twice, with no apparent justification: on February 20 to $131.6 million and on March 1 to $120 million. The congress estimated seven or eight years as the time required to complete the canal; de Lesseps reduced this estimate to six years (the Suez Canal required ten).\\r\\nThe proposed sea-level canal would have a uniform depth of 9 meters (29.5?ft), a bottom width of 22 meters (72.2?ft) and a width at water level of about 27.5 meters (90.2?ft); the excavation estimate was 120,000,000?m3 (157,000,000?cu?yd). A dam was proposed at Gamboa to control flooding of the Chagres River, with channels to drain water away from the canal. However, the Gamboa dam was later found impracticable and the Chagres River problem was left unsolved.\\r\\nConstruction of the canal began on January 1, 1881, with digging at Culebra beginning on January 22.[1] A large labor force was assembled, numbering about 40,000 in 1888 (nine-tenths of whom were afro-Caribbean workers from the West Indies). Although the project attracted good, well-paid French engineers, retaining them was difficult due to disease. The death toll from 1881 to 1889 was estimated at over 22,000, of whom as many as 5,000 were French citizens.[3]\\r\\nBy 1885 it had become clear to many that a sea-level canal was impractical, and an elevated canal with locks was preferable; de Lesseps resisted, and a lock canal plan was not adopted until October 1887. By this time increasing mortality rates, as well as financial and engineering problems coupled with frequent floods and mudslides, indicated that the project was in serious trouble. Work continued under the new plan until May 15, 1889, when the company went bankrupt and the project was suspended. After eight years the canal was about two-fifths completed, and about $234.8 million had been spent.\\r\\nThe company's collapse was a scandal in France, and the antisemitic Edouard Drumont exploited the role of two Jewish speculators in the affair. One hundred four legislators were found to have been involved in the corruption, and Jean Jaurs was commissioned by the French parliament to conduct an inquiry which was completed in 1893.[2]\\r\\nIt soon became clear that the only way to recoup expenses for the stockholders was to continue the project. A new concession was obtained from Colombia, and in 1894 the Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama was created to finish the canal. To comply with the terms of the contract, work began immediately on the Culebra excavation while a team of engineers began a comprehensive study of the project. They eventually settled on a plan for a two-level, lock-based canal.\\r\\nThe new effort never gained traction, mainly because of US speculation that a canal through Nicaragua would render one through Panama useless. The most men employed on the new project was 3,600 (in 1896), primarily to comply with the terms of the concession and to maintain the existing excavation and equipment in saleable condition. The company had already begun looking for a buyer, with an asking price of $109 million.\\r\\nIn the US, a congressional Isthmian Canal Commission was established in 1899 to examine possibilities for a Central American canal and recommend a route. In November 1901, the commission reported that a US canal should be built through Nicaragua unless the French were willing to sell their holdings for $40 million. The recommendation became law on June 28, 1902, and the New Panama Canal Company was compelled to sell at that price.[3]\\r\\nAlthough the French effort was, to a large extent, doomed to failure from the beginning due to disease and a lack of understanding of the engineering difficulties, it was not entirely futile. The old and new companies excavated 59,747,638?m3 (78,146,960?cu?yd) of material, of which 14,255,890?m3 (18,646,000?cu?yd) was taken from the Culebra Cut. The old company dredged a channel from Panama Bay to the port at Balboa, and the channel dredged on the Atlantic side (known as the French canal) was useful for bringing in sand and stone for the locks and spillway concrete at Gat~n.\\r\\nDetailed surveys and studies (particularly those carried out by the new canal company) and machinery, including railroad equipment and vehicles, aided the later American effort. The French lowered the summit of the Culebra Cut along the canal route by five meters (17?ft), from 64 to 59 metres (210 to 194?ft). An estimated 22,713,396?m3 (29,708,000?cu?yd) of excavation, valued at about $25.4 million, and equipment and surveys valued at about $17.4 million were usable by the Americans.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe 1848 discovery of gold in California and the rush of would-be miners stimulated US interest in building a canal between the oceans. In 1887, a United States Army Corps of Engineers regiment surveyed canal possibilities in Nicaragua. Two years later, the Maritime Canal Company was asked to begin a canal in the area and chose Nicaragua. The company lost money in the panic of 1893, and its work in Nicaragua ceased. In 1897 and 1899, the United States Congress charged a canal commission with researching possible construction; Nicaragua was chosen as the location both times.\\r\\nAlthough the Nicaraguan canal proposal was made redundant by the American takeover of the French Panama Canal project, increases in shipping volume and ship sizes have revived interest in the project. A canal across Nicaragua accommodating post-Panamax ships or a rail link carrying containers between ports on either coast have been proposed.[citation needed]\\r\\nTheodore Roosevelt believed that a US-controlled canal across Central America was a vital strategic interest of the country. This idea gained wide circulation after the destruction of the USS Maine in Cuba on February 15, 1898. Reversing a Walker Commission decision in favor of a Nicaraguan canal, Roosevelt encouraged the acquisition of the French Panama Canal effort. George S. Morison was the only commission member who argued for the Panama location. The purchase of the French-held land for $40?million was authorized by the June 28, 1902 Spooner Act. Since Panama was then part of Colombia, Roosevelt began negotiating with that country to obtain the necessary rights. In early 1903 the HayÿHerrn Treaty was signed by both nations, but the Senate of Colombia failed to ratify the treaty.\\r\\nRoosevelt implied to Panamanian rebels that if they revolted, the US Navy would assist their fight for independence. Panama declared its independence on November 3, 1903, and the USS Nashville impeded Colombian interference. The victorious Panamanians gave the United States control of the Panama Canal Zone on February 23, 1904, for $10?million in accordance with the November 18, 1903 HayÿBunau-Varilla Treaty.\\r\\nThe United States took control of the French property connected to the canal on May 4, 1904, when Lieutenant Jatara Oneel of the United States Army was presented with the keys during a small ceremony.[citation needed] The new Panama Canal Zone Control was overseen by the Isthmian Canal Commission (ICC) during construction.\\r\\nThe first step taken by the US government was to place all the canal workers under the new administration. The operation was maintained at minimum strength to comply with the canal concession and keep the machinery in working order. The US inherited a small workforce and an assortment of buildings, infrastructure and equipment, much of which had been neglected for fifteen years in the humid jungle environment. There were no facilities in place for a large workforce, and the infrastructure was crumbling.\\r\\nCataloguing assets was a large job; it took many weeks to card-index available equipment. About 2,150 buildings had been acquired,[4] many of which were uninhabitable; housing was an early problem, and the Panama Railway was in a state of decay. However, much equipment (such as locomotives, dredges and other floating equipment) was still serviceable.\\r\\nAlthough chief engineer John Findley Wallace was pressured to resume construction, red tape from Washington stifled his efforts to obtain heavy equipment and caused friction between Wallace and the ICC. He and chief sanitary officer William C. Gorgas were frustrated by delay, and Wallace resigned in 1905. He was replaced by John Frank Stevens, who arrived on July 26, 1905. Stevens quickly realized that serious investment in infrastructure was necessary and determined to upgrade the railway, improve sanitation in Panama City and Col܇n, renovate the old French buildings and build hundreds of new ones for housing. He then began the difficult task of recruiting the large labor force required for construction. Stevens' approach was to press ahead first and obtain approval later. He improved drilling and dirt-removal equipment at the Culebra Cut for greater efficiency, revising the inadequate provisions in place for soil disposal.\\r\\nNo decision had been made about whether the canal should be a lock or a sea-level one; the ongoing excavation would be useful in either case. In late 1905, President Roosevelt sent a team of engineers to Panama to investigate the relative merits of both types in cost and time. Although the engineers voted eight to five in favor of a sea-level canal, Stevens and the ICC opposed the plan; Stevens' report to Roosevelt was instrumental in convincing the president of the merits of a lock canal and Congress concurred. In November 1906 Roosevelt visited Panama to inspect the canal's progress, the first trip outside the United States by a sitting president.\\r\\nWhether contract employees or government workers would build the canal was controversial. Bids for the canal's construction were opened in January 1907, and Knoxville, Tennessee-based contractor William J. Oliver was the low bidder. Stevens disliked Oliver, and vehemently opposed his choice. Although Roosevelt initially favored the use of a contractor, he eventually decided that army engineers should carry out the work[4] and appointed Major George Washington Goethals as chief engineer (under Stevens' direction) in February 1907. Stevens, frustrated by government inaction and the army involvement, resigned and was replaced by Goethals.[5]\\r\\nThe US relied on a stratified workforce to build the canal. High-level engineering jobs, clerical positions, skilled labor and jobs in supporting industries were generally reserved for white Americans, with manual labor primarily by cheap immigrant labor. These jobs were initially filled by Europeans, primarily from Spain, Italy and Greece, many of whom were radical and militant due to political turmoil in Europe. The US then decided to recruit primarily from the British and French West Indies, and these workers provided most of the manual labor on the canal.[6]\\r\\nThe Canal Zone originally had minimal facilities for entertainment and relaxation for the canal workers apart from saloons; as a result, alcohol abuse was a great problem. The inhospitable conditions resulted in many American workers returning home each year.\\r\\nA program of improvements was implemented. Clubhouses were built, managed by the YMCA, with billiard, assembly and reading rooms, bowling alleys, darkrooms for camera clubs, gymnastic equipment, ice cream parlors, soda fountains and a circulating library. Member dues were ten dollars a year, with the remaining upkeep (about $7,000 at the larger clubhouses) paid by the ICC. The commission built baseball fields and arranged rail transportation to games; a competitive league soon developed. Semimonthly Saturday-night dances were held at the Hotel Tivoli, which had a spacious ballroom.\\r\\nThese measures influenced life in the Canal Zone; alcohol abuse fell, with saloon business declining by 60 percent.[citation needed] The number of workers leaving the project each year dropped significantly.\\r\\nThe work done thus far was preparation, rather than construction. By the time Goethals took over, the construction infrastructure had been created or overhauled and expanded from the French effort and he was soon able to begin construction in earnest.\\r\\nGoethals divided the project into three divisions: Atlantic, Central and Pacific. The Atlantic Division, under Major William L. Sibert, was responsible for construction of the breakwater at the entrance to Limon Bay, the Gat~n locks and their 5.6?km (3.5?mi) approach channel, and the Gatun Dam. The Pacific Division (under Sydney B. Williamson, the only civilian division head) was responsible for the Pacific entrance to the canal, including a 4.8?km (3.0?mi) breakwater in Panama Bay, the approach channel, and the Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks and their associated dams. The Central Division, under Major David du Bose Gaillard, was responsible for everything in between. It had arguably the project's greatest challenge: excavating the Culebra Cut (known as the Gaillard Cut from 1915 to 2000), which involved cutting 8 miles (13?km) through the continental divide down to 12 meters (40?ft) above sea level.\\r\\nBy August 1907, 765,000 m3 (1,000,000 cubic yards) per month was being excavated; this set a record for the rainy season; soon afterwards this doubled, before increasing again. At the peak of production, 2,300,000 m3 (3,000,000 cubic yards) were being excavated per month (the equivalent of digging a Channel Tunnel every 3? months).[citation needed]\\r\\nOne of the greatest barriers to a canal was the continental divide, which originally rose to 110 metres (360.9?ft) above sea level at its highest point. The effort to cut through this barrier of rock was one of the greatest challenges faced by the project.\\r\\nGoethals arrived at the canal with Major David du Bose Gaillard of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Gaillard was placed in charge of the canal's Central Division, which stretched from the Pedro Miguel locks to the Gatun Dam, and dedicated himself to getting the Culebra Cut (as it was then known) excavated.\\r\\nThe scale of the work was massive. Six thousand men worked in the cut, drilling holes in which a total of 27,000?t (60,000,000?lb) of dynamite were placed to break up the rock (which was then removed by as many as 160 trains per day). Landslides were frequent, due to the oxidation and weakening of the rock's underlying iron strata. Although the scale of the job and the frequent, unpredictable slides generated chaos, Gaillard provided quiet, clear-sighted leadership.\\r\\nOn May 20, 1913, Bucyrus steam shovels made a passage through the Culebra Cut at the level of the canal bottom. The French effort had reduced the summit to 59 metres (193.6?ft) over a relatively narrow width; the Americans had lowered this to 12 metres (39.4?ft) above sea level over a greater width, and had excavated over 76,000,000?m3 (99,000,000?cu?yd) of material. About 23,000,000?m3 (30,000,000?cu?yd) of this material in addition to the planned excavation, in the form of landslides. Dry excavation ended on September 10, 1913; a January slide had added 1,500,000?m3 (2,000,000?cu?yd) of earth, but it was decided that this loose material would be removed by dredging when the cut was flooded.\\r\\nTwo artificial lakes are key parts of the canal: Gatun and Miraflores Lakes. Four dams were constructed to create them. Two small dams at Miraflores impound Miraflores Lake, and a dam at Pedro Miguel encloses the south end of the Culebra Cut (essentially an arm of Lake Gatun). The Gatun Dam is the main dam blocking the original course of the Chagres River, creating Gatun Lake.\\r\\nThe Miraflores dams are an 825-metre (2,707?ft) earth dam connecting the Miraflores Locks in the west and a 150-metre (492?ft) concrete spillway dam east of the locks. The concrete dam has eight floodgates, similar to those on the Gatun spillway. The earthen, 430-metre (1,411?ft) Pedro Miguel dam extends from a hill in the west to the lock. Its face is protected by rock riprap at the water level. The largest and most challenging of the dams is the Gatun Dam. This earthen dam, 640 metres (2,100?ft) thick at the base and 2,300 metres (7,546?ft) long along the top, was the largest of its kind in the world when the canal opened.[citation needed]\\r\\nBuilding the locks began with the first concrete laid at Gatun on August 24, 1909. The Gatun locks are built into a cutting into a hill bordering the lake, requiring the excavation of 3,800,000?m3 (4,970,212?cu?yd) of material (mostly rock). The locks were made of 1,564,400?m3 (2,046,158?cu?yd) of concrete, with an extensive system of electric railways and cable cars transporting concrete to the lock-construction sites.\\r\\nThe Pacific-side locks were finished first: the single flight at Pedro Miguel in 1911, and Miraflores in May 1913. The seagoing tugboat Gatun, an Atlantic-entrance tug used to haul barges, traversed the Gatun locks on September 26, 1913. The trip was successful, although the valves were controlled manually; the central control board was not yet ready.\\r\\nOn October 10, 1913, the dike at Gamboa which had kept the Culebra Cut isolated from Gatun Lake was demolished; the detonation was made telegraphically by President Woodrow Wilson in Washington. On January 7, 1914, the Alexandre La Valley, an old French crane boat, became the first ship to make a complete transit of the Panama Canal under its own steam after working its way across during the final stages of construction.\\r\\nAs construction wound down, the canal team began to disperse. Thousands of workers were laid off, and entire towns were disassembled or demolished. Chief sanitary officer William C. Gorgas, who left to fight pneumonia in the South African gold mines, became surgeon general of the Army. On April 1, 1914 the Isthmian Canal Commission disbanded, and the zone was governed by a Canal Zone Governor; the first governor was George Washington Goethals.\\r\\nAlthough a large celebration was planned for the canal's opening, the outbreak of World War I forced the cancellation of the main festivities and it became a modest local affair. The Panama Railway steamship SS?Ancon, piloted by Captain John A. Constantine (the canal's first pilot), made the first official transit on August 15, 1914. With no international dignitaries in attendance, Goethals followed the Ancon's progress by railroad.\\r\\nThe canal was a technological marvel and an important strategic and economic asset to the US. It changed world shipping patterns, removing the need for ships to navigate the Drake Passage and Cape Horn. The canal saves a total of about 7,800 miles (12,600?km) on a sea trip from New York to San Francisco.\\r\\nIts anticipated military significance of the canal was proven during World War II, when the canal helped restore the devastated United States Pacific Fleet.[7] Some of the largest ships the United States had to send through the canal were aircraft carriers, particularly Essex class; they were so large that although the locks could accommodate them, the lampposts along the canal had to be removed.\\r\\nThe Panama Canal cost the United States about $375 million, including $10 million paid to Panama and $40 million paid to the French company. Although it was the most expensive construction project in US history to that time, it cost about $23 million less than the 1907 estimate despite landslides and an increase in the canal's width. An additional $12 million was spent on fortifications.\\r\\nA total of over 75,000 people worked on the project; at the peak of construction, there were 40,000 workers. According to hospital records, 5,609 workers died from disease and accidents during the American construction era.[citation needed]\\r\\nA total of 182,610,550?m3 (238,845,582?cu?yd) of material was excavated in the American effort, including the approach channels at the canal ends. Adding the work by the French, the total excavation was about 204,900,000?m3 (268,000,000?cu?yd) (over 25 times the volume excavated in the Channel Tunnel project).[citation needed]\\r\\nOf the three presidents whose terms spanned the construction period, Theodore Roosevelt is most associated with the canal and Woodrow Wilson presided over its opening. However, William Howard Taft may have given the canal its greatest impetus for the longest time. Taft visited Panama five times as Roosevelt's secretary of war and twice as president. He hired John Stevens and later recommended Goethals as Stevens' replacement. Taft became president in 1909, when the canal was half finished, and was in office for most of the remainder of the work. However, Goethals later wrote: \\"The real builder of the Panama Canal was Theodore Roosevelt\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nThe following words by Roosevelt are displayed in the rotunda of the canal's administration building in Balboa:[citation needed]\\r\\nIt is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement; and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.\\r\\nDavid du Bose Gaillard died of a brain tumor in Baltimore on December 5, 1913, at age 54. Promoted to colonel only a month earlier, Gaillard never saw the opening of the canal whose creation he directed. The Culebra Cut (as it was originally known) was renamed the Gaillard Cut on April 27, 1915, in his honor. A plaque commemorating Gaillard's work stood over the cut for many years; in 1998 it was moved to the administration building, near a memorial to Goethals.\\r\\nAs the situation in Europe deteriorated during the late 1930s, the US again became concerned about its ability to move warships between the oceans. The largest US battleships already had problems with the canal locks, and there were concerns about the locks being incapacitated by bombing.[8][9]\\r\\nThese concerns led Congress to pass a resolution on May 1, 1936, authorizing a study of improving the canal's defenses against attack and expanding its capacity to handle large vessels. A special engineering section was created on July 3, 1937, to carry out the study. The section reported to Congress on February 24, 1939, recommending work to protect the existing locks and the construction of a new set of locks capable of carrying larger vessels than the existing locks could accommodate. On August 11, Congress authorized the work.\\r\\nThree new locks were planned, at Gat~n, Pedro Miguel and Miraflores, parallel to the existing locks with new approach channels. The new locks would add a traffic lane to the canal, with each chamber 1,200?ft (365.76?m) long, 140?ft (42.67?m) wide and 45?ft (13.72?m) deep. They would be 1?2?mi (805?m) east of the existing Gat~n locks and 1?4?mi (402?m) west of the Pedro Miguel and Miraflores locks.\\r\\nThe first excavations for the new approach channels at Miraflores began on July 1, 1940, following the passage by Congress of an appropriations bill on June 24, 1940. The first dry excavation at Gat~n began on February 19, 1941. Considerable material was excavated before the project was abandoned, and the approach channels can still be seen paralleling the original channels at Gat~n and Miraflores.\\r\\nIn 2006, the Autoridad del Canal de Panam (the Panama Canal Authority, or ACP) proposed a plan creating a third lane of locks using part of the abandoned 1940s approach canals. Following a referendum, work began in 2007 and the expanded canal began commercial operations on June 26, 2016. After a two-year delay, the new locks allow the transit of Panamax ships (which have a greater cargo capacity than the original locks can handle). The first ship to cross the canal through the third set of locks was a Panamax container ship, the Chinese-owned Cosco Shipping Panama. The cost of the expansion was estimated at $5.25 billion.[2]\\r\\nAfter construction, the canal and the Canal Zone surrounding it were administered by the United States. On September 7, 1977, US President Jimmy Carter signed the Torrijos-Carter Treaty setting in motion the process of transferring control of the canal to Panama. The treaty became effective on October 1, 1979, providing for a 20-year period in which Panama would have increasing responsibility for canal operations before complete US withdrawal on December 31, 1999. Since then, the canal has been administered by the Panama Canal Authority (Autoridad de Canal de Panama, or ACP).\\r\\nThe treaty was controversial in the US, and its passage was difficult. The controversy was largely generated by contracts to manage two ports, at either end of the canal, which were awarded by Panama to Hong Kong-based conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa. According to US Republicans, the company has close ties to the Chinese government and the Chinese military.[10] However, the United States Department of State said that it found no evidence of connections between Hutchison Whampoa and Beijing.[11] Some Americans were wary of placing the strategic waterway under the protection of Panamanian security forces.[12]\\r\\nAlthough concerns existed in the US and the shipping industry about the canal after the transfer, Panama has exercised good stewardship.[13] According to ACP figures, canal income increased from $769?million in 2000 (the first year under Panamanian control) to $1.4?billion in 2006.[citation needed] Traffic through the canal increased from 230 million tons in 2000 to nearly 300?million tons in 2006. The number of accidents has decreased from an average of 28 per year in the late 1990s to 12 in 2005. Transit time through the canal averages about 30 hours, about the same as during the late 1990s. Canal expenses have increased less than revenue, from $427?million in 2000 to $497?million in 2006. On October 22, 2006, Panamanian citizens approved a referendum to expand the canal.\\r\\nFormer US Ambassador to Panama Linda Watt, who served from 2002 to 2005, said that the canal operation in Panamanian hands has been \\"outstanding\\". \\"The international shipping community is quite pleased\\", Watt added.[14]\\r\\nEarly proposal","input":"When did the panama canal started being built?"},{"output":"National Football Conference (NFC) South division","context":"National Football League (1967ÿpresent)\\r\\nOld Gold, Black, White[3][4]\\r\\nLeague championships (1)\\r\\nConference championships (1)\\r\\nDivision championships (6)\\r\\nTemporary stadiums in 2005 due to the effects of Hurricane Katrina:\\r\\nThe New Orleans Saints are a professional American football team based in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Saints currently compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) South division. The team was founded by John W. Mecom Jr., David Dixon and the city of New Orleans. The Saints began play in Tulane Stadium in 1967.\\r\\nThe name \\"Saints\\" is an allusion to November 1 being All Saints Day in the Catholic faith, New Orleans' large Catholic population, and the spiritual \\"When the Saints Go Marching In\\", which is strongly associated with New Orleans and often sung by fans at games. The franchise was founded on November 1, 1966.[6] The team's primary colors are old gold and black; their logo is a simplified fleur-de-lis. They played their home games in Tulane Stadium through the 1974 NFL season. The following year, they moved to the new Louisiana Superdome (now the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, since Mercedes-Benz has purchased the stadium's naming rights).[7][8]\\r\\nFor most of their first 20 years, the Saints were barely competitive, only getting to .500 twice. In 1987, they finished 12ÿ3their first-ever winning seasonand qualified for the NFL playoffs for the first time in franchise history, but lost to the Minnesota Vikings 44ÿ10. The next season of 1988 ended with a 10ÿ6 record, but no playoff berth. In the 2000 season, the Saints defeated the defending Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams 31ÿ28 to notch their first-ever playoff win.\\r\\nIn 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast region. The Superdome was used as an emergency temporary shelter for displaced residents. The stadium suffered damage from the hurricane (notably from flooding and part of the roof being torn off as well as internal damage), and from lack of available facilities. The Saints were forced to play their first scheduled home game against the New York Giants at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey (the Giants' home stadium); other home games were rescheduled at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas or Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. During the season, it was rumored that Saints owner Tom Benson might deem the Superdome unusable and seek to legally void his contract and relocate the team to San Antonio, where he has business interests. Ultimately, however, the Superdome was repaired and renovated in time for the 2006 season at an estimated cost of US$185 million. The New Orleans Saints' first post-Katrina home game was an emotionally charged Monday Night Football game versus their division rival, the Atlanta Falcons. The Saints, under rookie head coach Sean Payton and new quarterback Drew Brees, defeated the Falcons 23ÿ3, and went on to notch the second playoff win in franchise history.\\r\\nThe 2009 season was a historic one for the Saints. Winning a franchise-record 13 games, they qualified for Super Bowl XLIV and defeated the AFC champion Indianapolis Colts 31ÿ17. To date, it is the only Super Bowl championship that they have won, and as it is the only Super Bowl the Saints have appeared in, they join the New York Jets and Tampa Bay Buccaneers as the only three NFL teams to win their lone Super Bowl appearance.\\r\\nOver the course of 50 seasons, the Saints have compiled an overall record of 345ÿ436ÿ5, with a regular season record of 338ÿ427ÿ5 and a playoff record of 8ÿ10.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst the brainchild of local sports entrepreneur Dave Dixon, who later built the Louisiana Superdome and founded the USFL, the Saints were actually secretly born in a backroom deal brought about by U.S. Congressman Hale Boggs, U.S. Senator Russell Long, and NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle. The NFL needed congressional approval of the proposed AFLÿNFL merger.[9] Dixon and a local civic group had been seeking an NFL franchise for over five years and had hosted record crowds for NFL exhibition games. To seal the merger, Rozelle arrived in New Orleans within a week, and announced on November 1, 1966, that the NFL officially had awarded the city of New Orleans an NFL franchise. The team was named for the great jazz song most identified with New Orleans ÿ \\"When the Saints Go Marching In\\", and it was no coincidence that the franchise's official birth was announced on November 1, which is the Catholic All Saints' Day. When the deal was reached a week earlier, Dixon strongly suggested to Rozelle that the announcement be delayed until then. Dixon told an interviewer that he even cleared the name with New Orleans' Archbishop Philip M. Hannan: \\"He thought it would be a good idea. He had an idea the team was going to need all the help it could get.\\"[10]\\r\\nBoggs' Congressional committee in turn quickly approved the NFL merger. John W. Mecom Jr., a young oilman from Houston, became the team's first majority stockholder. The team's colors, black and gold, symbolized both Mecom's and New Orleans' strong ties to the oil industry. Trumpeter Al Hirt was part owner of the team, and his rendition of \\"When the Saints Go Marching In\\" was made the official fight song.[citation needed]\\r\\nThat first season started with a 94-yard opening kickoff return for a touchdown by John Gilliam, but the Saints lost that game 27ÿ13 to the Los Angeles Rams at Tulane Stadium. It was one of the few highlights of a season that ultimately saw the Saints finish 3ÿ11, which set an NFL record for most wins by an expansion team.\\r\\nFor most of their first 20 years, the Saints were the definition of NFL futility. They would not finish as high as second in their division until 1979. The 1979 and 1983 teams were the only ones to even finish at .500 until 1987.\\r\\nOne of the franchise's early bright moments came on November 8, 1970, when Tom Dempsey kicked an NFL record-breaking 63-yard field goal to defeat the Detroit Lions by a score of 19ÿ17 in the final seconds of the game. The record was not broken until 2013 by Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos.\\r\\nIn 1980, the Saints lost their first 14 games, prompting local sportscaster Bernard \\"Buddy D\\" Diliberto to advise Saints supporters to wear paper bags over their heads at the team's home games; many bags rendered the club's name as the \\"'Aints\\" rather than the \\"Saints.\\"[5]\\r\\nCurrent Saints owner Tom Benson acquired the franchise in 1985, and hired Jim Finks as general manager and Jim Mora as head coach. That combination provided the Saints with their first-ever winning record and playoff appearance, going 12ÿ3 in 1987, which had one fewer game than normal due to a players' strike. Another playoff berth would follow in 1991, and the club's first division title came in 1991. During Mora's tenure, the Saints made the playoffs four times, with teams marked by strong defenses led by the \\"Dome Patrol\\" linebacking corps, but they were never able to win a playoff game. Mora coached the Saints until the middle of the 1996 season, when he stepped down halfway through the 3ÿ13 season. His 93 wins were three more than the Saints won in their entire history prior to his arrival, and would remain the most for any Saints coach until 2016.\\r\\nAfter the end of the 1996 season, ironically as Diliberto had suggested before Mora's resignation, former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka was hired to replace Mora. Although this initially generated a lot of excitement among Saints fans, Ditka's tenure ended up being a failure. The Saints went 6ÿ10 in their first two seasons under Ditka (1997 and 1998). During the 1999 NFL Draft, Ditka traded all of his picks for that season, as well as the first-round and third-round picks for the following season, to the Washington Redskins in order to draft University of Texas Heisman Trophy running back Ricky Williams in the first round. Ditka and Williams had a mock wedding picture taken to commemorate the occasion. However, Ditka, most of his coaching staff, and general manager Bill Kuharich were fired at the end of the 1999 season due to the club's 3ÿ13 record.\\r\\nJim Haslett held the post from 2000 to 2005. In his first year, he took the team to the 2000 playoffs and defeated the defending Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams for the team's first ever playoff win. The team lost the following week to the Minnesota Vikings. After winning the 2000 NFL Executive of the Year Award, General Manager Randy Mueller was fired between the 2001 and 2002 seasons without explanation by Benson. The Saints failed to make the playoffs in 2001 and 2002, although in the latter year they had the distinction of beating the eventual Super Bowl XXXVII champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in both of their regular season meetings, only the second team to do so in NFL history.\\r\\nIn 2003, the Saints again missed the playoffs after finishing 8ÿ8. The 2004 season started poorly for the Saints, as they went 2ÿ4 through their first six games and 4ÿ8 through their first twelve games. At that point Haslett's job appeared to be in jeopardy; however, he managed to win the three straight games leading up to the season finale, leaving the Saints in playoff contention in the final week of the season. In week 17, the Saints defeated division rivals Carolina; however, the Saints needed other results to break their way and when the St. Louis Rams beat the New York Jets the Saints were eliminated despite having beaten the Rams, who finished with the same record. The Rams, Saints, and Vikings all were 8ÿ8, with the Rams having a 7ÿ5 conference record, Saints 6ÿ6, and the Vikings 5ÿ7. The Rams received the #1 wild-card due to having the best conference record out of the 3, followed by the Vikings due to the 38ÿ31 loss handed to the Saints in Week 6. Haslett was fired after the 2005 season, in which the Saints finished 3ÿ13 and did not play any regular season games in New Orleans due to Hurricane Katrina.\\r\\nDue to the damage Hurricane Katrina caused to the Superdome and the New Orleans area, the Saints' scheduled 2005 home opener against the New York Giants was moved to Giants Stadium. The remainder of their 2005 home games were split between the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, and LSU's Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\\r\\nOn January 17, 2006, the Saints hired Sean Payton as their new head coach.\\r\\n2006 season\\r\\nOn March 23, the Saints announced that the team's two 2006 preseason games were to be played at Shreveport, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi. After a $185 million renovation of the historic stadium, on April 6 the Saints released their 2006 schedule, with all home games scheduled to be played at the Superdome. On September 19, Saints owner Tom Benson announced that the team had sold out the Louisiana Superdome for the entire season with season tickets alone (68,354 seats), a first in franchise history.[11]\\r\\nThe September 25, 2006 home opener, the first home game in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, was won by the Saints 23ÿ3 against the Atlanta Falcons, who were undefeated in the 2006 season at that time. The attendance for the game was a sellout crowd of 70,003. Meanwhile, the broadcast of the game was ESPN's highest-ever rated program to date, with an 11.8 rating, and viewership by 10,850,000 homes. It was the most-watched program for the night, broadcast or cable, and was the second-highest rated cable program of all time at the time. Green Day and U2 performed \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" and \\"The Saints Are Coming\\", respectively, before the game. The game received a 2007 ESPY award for \\"Best Moment in Sports.\\" The game is remembered by Saints fans for Steve Gleason's blocked punt on the opening series that resulted in a touchdown for New Orleans.\\r\\nOn December 17, 2006, the Saints clinched their third division title and their first NFC South title in franchise history. For the first time in Saints' history, they clinched their NFC South title on their home field. Sean Payton became the second consecutive Saints coach to win a division title in his first season. After the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Dallas Cowboys 23ÿ7 on Christmas Day 2006, the Saints clinched a first-round playoff bye for the first time in franchise history.\\r\\nAfter the first-round bye, the Saints beat the Philadelphia Eagles 27ÿ24 in the Superdome in the 2006 Divisional Playoffs. No team had ever had such a poor record in the prior year (3ÿ13) and then gone on to a league or conference championship game since the 1999 St. Louis Rams who advanced to win their first Super Bowl after being 4ÿ12 the season before. Since the Saints' only previous playoff win was in the wild card round, this was the farthest the Saints had ever advanced at the time. The victory was only the second playoff win in team history. The season ended on January 21, 2007, when the Saints lost 39ÿ14 to the Chicago Bears in the NFC Championship game.\\r\\n2007 season\\r\\nThe Saints announced that for the second year in a row, the Louisiana Superdome had sold out every ticket for the season.[12] Additionally, all luxury boxes had been sold out for the season.[citation needed] Both of these statistics are particularly surprising given that the city-proper has about 300,000 people or 150,000 fewer people than July 2005 population data (though the metro area still accounts for 1.2 million people).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first game of the season was against the defending Super Bowl XLI champion Indianapolis Colts. The Saints lost this game, 41ÿ10, and lost their next three games. In one of these three games, against the Tennessee Titans, the Saints lost running back Deuce McAllister for the season with his second career (second time in three seasons) ACL tear. After winning their first game, against the Seattle Seahawks, two weeks later, the team went on a four-game winning streak to bring their record to an even 4ÿ4. After reaching 7ÿ7, the Saints lost their final two games to finish 7ÿ9.\\r\\n2008 season\\r\\nFollowing a disappointing 7ÿ9 record in the 2007 season, the Saints ended the 2008 season 8ÿ8. Failing to qualify for the post season for the second straight year, the Saints found themselves struggling on defense. However, the Saints would match the explosive offense they had in the 2006 season. Drew Brees ended the 2008 season just 16 yards short of beating Dan Marino's single-season record of 5084 total passing yards, and receiver Lance Moore came 72 yards short of his first 1000-yard season.\\r\\n2009 season: First Super Bowl championship\\r\\nThe 2009 season was the team's most successful season, which culminated in the franchise's first league championship win against the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLIV. After achieving a record of 13ÿ0 with their win over the Atlanta Falcons, it marked the Saints' best start to a season in its franchise history. The result clinched an NFC playoff berth, a bye in the first round of the playoffs. By winning their first 13 games, the Saints also set the record for the longest undefeated season opening (13ÿ0) by an NFC team since the AFLÿNFL merger, surpassing the previous record (12ÿ0) held by the 1985 Chicago Bears. However, they would fall victim to the Dallas Cowboys in week 14, going on to end the season with a three-game losing streak. Saints became the first team to win a Super Bowl after losing its last three regular season games.\\r\\nAlthough its opponents would include winners of 9 of the last 15 NFL MVP awards, the team advanced to the 2009 NFC Championship game where they defeated the Minnesota Vikings, led by Brett Favre, 31ÿ28 in overtime (at 9:19 CST), earning their first Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. Television ratings for Super Bowl XLIV (44) were the highest for any TV program, sports or otherwise, in history,[13] as their successful bid to win the Super Bowl was seen by many to represent the city's resurgence after the devastating Hurricane Katrina.[14]\\r\\n2010 season\\r\\nThe Saints 2010 season began in the Superdome as the defending Super Bowl champions defeated the Minnesota Vikings 14ÿ9, in a rematch of the 2009 NFC Championship Game. It was played on Thursday September 9, 2010 and televised on NBC, making it the first time the Saints have opened the NFL's season at home. On Sunday, August 8, 2010, NBC announced the televised opening festivities of the evening would begin with Taylor Swift and Dave Matthews Band. On December 27, 2010, with a 17ÿ14 win against the Atlanta Falcons in Atlanta the Saints clinched a playoff appearance (wild card). This marked the first time a team in the NFC South had made back-to-back playoff appearances since the division was formed in 2002. The Saints would face the Seattle Seahawks for the wild-card opener at Qwest Field. The Seahawks were the first NFL team to capture their division with a sub-.500 regular season record (7ÿ9). Drew Brees completed a postseason-record 39 passes for 404 yards and two touchdowns. Despite throwing 60 passes and hindered by a lack of depth at running back, last year's Super Bowl MVP was not intercepted and rallied the Saints within 34ÿ30 in the fourth quarter. In the end, his efforts were negated by a defense that could not get enough stops and a late touchdown run by Marshawn Lynch breaking over a half-dozen tackles with 3:22 left which helped the Seahawks defeat the Saints 41ÿ36.\\r\\n2011 season\\r\\nThe Saints began their season with a loss against the Green Bay Packers, but the team rebounded for the next four weeks to bring their record to 4ÿ1. A loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers brought the record to 4ÿ2, but the team bounced back with a 62ÿ7 blowout win against the struggling Indianapolis Colts. A surprise loss to the St. Louis Rams resulted in the record dropping to 5ÿ3. In the next seven weeks the Saints beat talented teams such as the eventual Super Bowl XLVI champion New York Giants, Detroit Lions, and Atlanta Falcons, bringing their season record to 12ÿ3. To cap off the season, quarterback Drew Brees broke the single season passing record held for over 25 years, on the way to a Saints division winning game. The Saints won the NFC South title on December 26 and ended the 2011 season as the 3rd Seed in the NFC. They finished with a 13ÿ3 record, beating Carolina 45ÿ17 and also giving running back Darren Sproles the record for most all-purpose yards in a single season. The team broke numerous records that year including most yards in a season, completion percentage, yards passing, completions and more. The New Orleans Saints beat the Detroit Lions in the 2011 NFC wild-card playoff game 45ÿ28. New Orleans also tied the NFL's postseason mark for team first downs in a game (34), and broke the record for total yards with 626, eclipsing the yardage record set 49 years ago. The Saints lost Saturday, January 14, 2012 in the Divisional round in the playoffs against the San Francisco 49ers in Candlestick Park. A game that was considered an instant classic by many as the game saw numerous lead changes in the final 4 minutes of play.\\r\\n2012 season: Payton suspended; punishment for Bountygate\\r\\nAfter an offseason dominated by news of the bounty scandal and the year-long suspension of head coach Sean Payton, the Saints sought to refocus on football and produce yet another winning year. Instead, the team, led by offensive line coach Aaron Kromer for its first six games, started the season with four straight losses and a last place spot in the NFC South. The team finally broke through with a win in Week 5, against the San Diego Chargers, a game that also saw quarterback Drew Brees break Johnny Unitas's longstanding record for consecutive games with a touchdown pass. After their scheduled bye, the Saints went on to win 4 of their next 5 games, to bring their record to an even 5ÿ5. Joe Vitt returned after his six-game suspension to serve as interim head coach for the rest of the season. The team failed to hold its momentum, however, and lost the next three games, including a loss at Atlanta that also marked the end of Brees' record touchdown streak after 54 games, and a 52ÿ27 blowout loss to the Giants that dropped the Saints to 5ÿ8. Despite winning 2 of their last 3 games, and Brees again leading the league with 5,177 passing yards (his third time to surpass 5,000 yards, as he remained the only quarterback to break that barrier more than once), the team finished tied for last in the NFC South, at 7ÿ9. The Saints defense allowed 7,042 yards, setting an NFL record.[15]\\r\\n2013 season\\r\\nThe Saints finished their 2013 preseason 3ÿ1, and won their first five regular season games against the Atlanta Falcons, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Arizona Cardinals, Miami Dolphins and Chicago Bears. The Saints under Sean Peyton had been winless in Chicago's Soldier Field and had not won in the Windy City since 2000. The Saints fared well against Chicago, Arizona and Miami, winning 26ÿ18, 31ÿ7 and 38ÿ17 respectively, but needed a 4th down shutdown and a last-minute field goal to escape Atlanta and Tampa Bay. The Saints went on a 5ÿ0 win streak, but were stopped short by the New England Patriots in Week 6, losing 30ÿ27, with a touchdown pass by Tom Brady in the last 5 seconds of the game. New Orleans would go undefeated at home for the second straight season with Sean Payton as the head coach, but finish just 3ÿ5 on the road. Key losses included a 7ÿ34 blowout against the Seattle Seahawks on Monday Night Football in Seattle which cost them homefield advantage throughout the playoffs, a 16ÿ27 upset against the St. Louis Rams in St. Louis which led to the Saints needing to win their next game against Carolina to control their own playoff destiny, and a heartbreaking 13ÿ17 defeat to their division rival the Carolina Panthers in Charlotte who went on to win the NFC South. The Saints finished the season with an 11ÿ5 record and earned a wild card berth as the 6th seed in the NFC. On January 4, 2014, the Saints recorded their first road playoff win in franchise history over the Philadelphia Eagles 26ÿ24. On January 11, the Saints lost to the number 1 seed Seattle Seahawks once again in Seattle 15ÿ23. The weather conditions were very poor, which gave the offense much difficulty. Despite the conditions, the defense of the Saints played well, holding Seattle to just 23 over the 34 points allowed against Seattle during the regular season.\\r\\n2014 season\\r\\nThe Saints finished the season 7ÿ9, second in their division behind the 7ÿ8ÿ1 Carolina Panthers. They missed out on the playoffs after being defeated 14ÿ30 by their divisional rival, the Atlanta Falcons, in the second-to-last week of the season. This season was notorious in Saints history for having the 31st worst ranked defense in the league, which is one of the main reasons for the Saints poor 2014 campaign. The only two great performances by the defense out of the entire season came from a 44ÿ23 home win against the Green Bay Packers and a 31ÿ15 victory against the Chicago Bears in Chicago.\\r\\n2015 season\\r\\nThe Saints finished with a 7-9 record for the second consecutive season. They were third in the NFC South after the 15-1 NFC champions Carolina Panthers and the 8-8 Atlanta Falcons. Their defense was historically bad. They allowed the most passing touchdowns in a season in NFL history as they allowed 45, effectively making them the worst passing defense in NFL history. They also set the NFL record in opposing passer rating (116.2), while finishing last in points allowed (29.8) and yards allowed per play (6.6).[16] Atrocious play by defensive captain Brandon Browner, who set the NFL record for most penalties with 23, didn't help the struggling Saints defense. Defensive coordinator Rob Ryan was fired near the half-way point in the season and was replaced by senior defensive assistant Dennis Allen.[17] The Saints had strong play from their 2015 draft class. The Saints first pick Andrus Peat started at right tackle and left guard at certain points in the season, and other first-round pick Stephone Anthony finished his rookie season with 112 tackles, one sack, one interception, and two forced fumbles. He had two scores, both coming against the Carolina Panthers and led all rookies in tackles. Second-round pick Hau'oli Kikaha had 4 sacks. Canadian football star Delvin Breaux, who was signed in the offseason, led the Saints struggling secondary with 3 interceptions and 19 pass deflections. Drew Brees also tied the NFL record for touchdown passes in a game with 7, coming against the New York Giants.[18]\\r\\nAfter a lengthy investigation conducted by the National Football League's security department, the league alleged on March 2, 2012, that 22 to 27 defensive players on the New Orleans Saints maintained a \\"pay for performance\\" program that included \\"bounty\\" payments administered by defensive coordinator Gregg Williams during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stated, \\"The payments here are particularly troubling because they involved not just payments for 'performance,' but also for injuring opposing players.\\" The report also found that head coach Sean Payton was aware of the allegations but failed to stop the program. The league also said that Mickey Loomis, the Saints' general manager, was directed to end the program by owner Tom Benson, but didn't. The memo released to NFL teams found Payton and Loomis guilty of \\"conduct detrimental\\" to the league.[19]\\r\\nOn March 3, 2012, Benson addressed the bounty payments controversy on the Saints' website, stating, \\"I have been made aware of the NFL's findings relative to the \\"Bounty Rule\\" and how it relates to our club. I have offered and the NFL has received our full cooperation in their investigation. While the findings may be troubling, we look forward to putting this behind us and winning more championships in the future for our fans.\\"[20]\\r\\nOn March 21, 2012, Commissioner Goodell announced that, as a result of the bounty scandal and the NFL's investigation, Sean Payton has been suspended for one year, Gregg Williams indefinitely, and Mickey Loomis for the first eight regular season games. The team was also fined $500,000 and docked second round draft picks in 2012 and 2013. Saints assistant coach Joe Vitt also was suspended six games and fined $100,000. Payton's suspension started on April 1, 2012, and all the suspensions are without pay. Goodell will meet with Williams again after the 2012 season to determine the coach's status.[21]\\r\\nOn May 2, 2012, it was announced that four players who played for the team between 2009 and 2011 would receive suspensions for their alleged participation in \\"Bountygate\\": Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma (16 games), Saints defensive lineman Will Smith (4 games), former Saints/retired linebacker Scott Fujita (3 games), and former Saints/current Packers defensive lineman Anthony Hargrove (8 games).[22]\\r\\nMost of the players who were the targets of questionable hits by the Saints, including Favre and Warner, claimed the bounties were merely part of the game.[23] However, several former players interviewed by Sports Illustrated said that while payments for good hits and sacks were indeed considered part of the game, bounties for intentionally injuring opponents violated an unwritten code.\\r\\nHowever, on July 26, 2012, Jonathan Vilma and seven witnesses from the Saints testified in front of a federal judge in New Orleans that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell got his facts wrong in the bounty scandal. \\"Everybody was sworn in under oath in front of a judge with the risk of perjury and jail time if we were lying, and categorically denied there was a bounty\\", Vilma said in a text message to ESPN's Ed Werder. \\"Seven people testified, 2 sworn affidavits (one by Drew Brees) all saying the same thing. I ask that you and ESPN report the facts. No more bias or b.s. or hearsay. I gave you facts that you can report if so choose.\\"[24]\\r\\nTulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman (who attended the hearing in court) said, \\"Clearly the judge, by her questions, indicated she thinks Goodell overstepped his authority, and this case was always going to be about if he executed his power fairly... The NFL's retort is that with all due deference, you don't get to second guess (commissioner Roger Goodell). Judges only have limited jurisdiction over arbitration issues.\\"[25]\\r\\nSaints All-Pro quarterback Drew Brees made a controversial tweet on June 20, 2012, stating, \\"If NFL fans were told there were 'weapons of mass destruction' enough times, they'd believe it. But what happens when you don't find any????\\" Brees immediately issued another statement to clarify, \\"My WMD comment has nothing to do with politics or our brave military. Merely an analogy to show how media influences public perception.\\" He went on to say, \\"I apologize if the WMD comment offended anyone. Especially our military. There is no one I respect more than our service men and women.\\"[26]\\r\\nBlack, along with old gold and white, has always been one of the team colors, but it wasn't the first choice of original majority owner John W. Mecom Jr. His preference was for Mecom blue, a medium shade which was used by all of his other investments. The NFL office, however, informed him that his proposed combination too closely resembled that worn by the San Diego Chargers. Although the Chargers were members of the AFL, the older league didn't want to offend its soon-to-be partner so soon after the merger. Mecom settled on black as the primary color as a nod to his financial involvement in the petroleum industry. \\"Black gold\\" is a term synonymous with oil.[27] Although the Pittsburgh Steelerswho played a few home games in New Orleans during their early years to avoid conflict with the Pittsburgh Panthers football teamhave long used black and gold as their colors, their shade of gold more closely resembles yellow, making the Saints black and gold compatible with the rest of the NFL.\\r\\nExcept for minor modifications, the Saints' logo and uniforms have basically remained the same since the club debuted in 1967. The team's logo is a fleur-de-lis (a symbol of the City of New Orleans and of France's Royal Family, which included the House of Bourbon), while its uniform design consists of gold helmets, gold pants, and either black or white jerseys. Minor changes to the uniform stripes and trim have been made throughout the years. The team wore black helmets during the 1969 preseason, but NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle barred the Saints from using the helmets during the regular season, since Mecom did not notify the league office of the change.\\r\\nThe Saints predominantly wore white at home when the club played at Tulane Stadium from 1967 through 1974 (except in 1969 and 1970), forcing opponents to suffer in their darker jerseys in the subtropical climate of New Orleans. When the surface at Tulane Stadium switched from natural grass to PolyTurf in 1971, field temperatures became hotter still. In Archie Manning's first game, in the 1971 season opener against the Los Angeles Rams, temperatures on the field reached as high as 130?F (54?C). The heavily favored Rams wilted in the stifling heat, and the Saints claimed their first-ever victory over their NFC West rivals, 24ÿ20, on Manning's one-yard quarterback sneak on the last play of the game.\\r\\nThe Saints switched to white pants in 1975, coinciding with the team's move from Tulane Stadium to the Superdome, and have worn white at home numerous times since then. One year later, they started to wear black pants with their white jerseys, a move influenced by coach Hank Stram, who introduced red pants to the Kansas City Chiefs' uniforms in 1968. In an October 3, 1976 home game against the Houston Oilers, Hank Stram used the Saints' road uniforms, the white jerseys and black pants. The Saints lost that game 31ÿ26. During the 1981ÿ82 seasons (Bum Phillips' first two seasons as coach), the team wore white jerseys with black pants at home, but reverted to the black jerseys and white pants for 1983. They reverted to wearing gold pants with both their black and white jerseys in 1986 under new coach Jim E. Mora. From 1986 through 1995, the sleeves of the jerseys and sides of the pants featured a logo with a fleur-de-lis inside an outline of the state of Louisiana (with the location of New Orleans marked with a star in the state outline). The logo replaced the striping pattern that had been on the uniforms since the team's inception; save for color variations, the striping pattern was similar to that used by the Washington Redskins (until 1979), Green Bay Packers (until 1997), and Cleveland Browns (until 2014), which is likely why the change was made. That logo was removed in 1996 and replaced with a fleur-de-lis on both the sleeves and sides of the pants.\\r\\nFrom 1996 through 1998, the Saints returned to gold numbers on both the white and black jerseys, but complaints about the numbers on the white jerseys being too difficult to read forced the numbers on the white jerseys to be changed to black in 1999. The Saints wore black pants with a wide gold stripe with their white jerseys in 1999, but following a 3ÿ13 season and the dismissal of coach Mike Ditka, the black pants were mothballed by new coach Jim Haslett.\\r\\nIn 2000, the Saints won their first playoff game as they hosted the St. Louis Rams, and after having a better road record than home record, they wore their white jerseys, and won 31ÿ28 over the defending champion Rams. The defining play of the game came with the Saints clinging to a three-point lead with minutes to play. The Saints punted to the Rams' Az-Zahir Hakim (who would play one season for the Saints in 2005), who fumbled the punt deep in Rams' territory. Brian Milne recovered for the Saints, who then ran out the clock to preserve the victory.\\r\\nIn 2001, they wore their white jerseys in the first six home games. During that same year, they primarily wore black pants with both their white and black jerseys. They became the first NFL team to wear all-black uniforms in a week 5 road game against the Carolina Panthers, and again in weeks 16 and 17 in home games against the Washington Redskins and San Francisco 49ers; the Saints were outscored 78ÿ10 in the final two contests to end a 7ÿ9 campaign.\\r\\nIn 2002, the Saints wore black pants with their white jerseys (except for the final road game, a 20ÿ13 loss in Cincinnati when they went back to the gold pants), and gold pants with their black jerseys, a gold alternate jersey, and a 1967-style throwback uniform, complete with an accurate 1967-era helmet which featured a larger fleur-de-lis, a darker shade of gold and grey facemasks. But one season later, they stopped using the alternates and again reverted to wearing gold pants with both their black and white jerseys.\\r\\nThe team introduced a gold alternate jersey (worn with the black pants) during a December 15, 2002 game versus the Minnesota Vikings, a 32ÿ31 loss, but have never worn them since then. Because of the metallic gold's bright color, the gold jerseys were considered the \\"light\\" jersey in the game, so the Vikings wore their purple home jerseys as the \\"dark\\" colored team. One team must wear \\"dark\\" and one team must wear \\"light\\", this was done because of black & white t.v. broadcasts so viewers could tell the teams apart. The only exception being if both teams are wearing throwback uniforms, such as Thanksgiving Classic games. From 2003 through 2007, the New England Patriots had a \\"light\\" jersey (their alternate, a bright metallic silver) that isn't white in which the other team would wear their colored, or \\"dark\\" jerseys against them since the third jersey rule was implemented in the NFL in 2002.\\r\\nThe Saints also introduced a 1967-style throwback uniform in a 23ÿ20 win on December 1, 2002, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. This uniform wasn't worn again until a 40ÿ33 win against the Houston Texans on September 25, 2011, and also on November 6, 2011, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a 27ÿ16 Saints win. However, the 2011 throwbacks use the current-helmet, meaning the shades of gold on the helmet and jersey do not match.\\r\\nIn 2006, to honor their return to Louisiana, the Saints wore a patch on their uniforms with an outline of the State of Louisiana with a fleur-de-lis superimposed, similar to the logo from the 1980s.\\r\\nThe Saints originally planned to wear white jerseys at home for the 2006 season, but during the season, the players voted to wear the black jerseys at home after the second game. Since the team had informed the NFL office that they planned to wear white jerseys at home, each of the Saints' remaining home opponents would have to agree to New Orleans' request. The Atlanta Falcons, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Cincinnati Bengals did not agree to the switch, forcing the Saints to wear white jerseys for those games.\\r\\nStarting in week 13 of the 2006 season, the Saints wore black pants with the black jerseys against the San Francisco 49ers, and in a Week 16 game in The Meadowlands against the New York Giants (a 30ÿ7 Saints win), the Saints wore the black pants with their road white jerseys. The Saints later stuck with the black pants in their 2006 playoff run.\\r\\nSince 2008, the Saints have worn white jerseys at home for preseason games and early regular season home games.\\r\\nIn 2009, the Saints wore the black pants only once, beating St. Louis 28ÿ23. They wore the white jerseys/gold pants combination during the Super Bowl XLIV victory over the Indianapolis Colts. In 2012, the Saints wore black pants 12 times and wore gold pants 4 times. In 2013, gold pants were used only 7 times (including playoffs).\\r\\nThe Mercedes-Benz Superdome is the Saints' home stadium. It has a listed seating capacity of 76,468 (expanded) or 73,208 (not expanded). The Saints own a perfect record there against the Houston Texans (2-0) and Jacksonville Jaguars (3-0), but a winless one against the Baltimore Ravens (0ÿ2).\\r\\nThe Saints' oldest rival are the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons lead the rivalry series 49ÿ45. The two clubs joined the NFL within a year of each other as expansion teams and have played each other twice a season since the Saints joined the league in 1967.\\r\\nThe Saints have a developing rivalry with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who have been part of the NFC South with the Saints since 2002.\\r\\nThe teams actually played each other quite often as non-division rivals. Between 1977 and 2001, there were only five years in which the teams did not play. This includes 12 years in a row from 1981 to 1992 ÿ all as a result of the scheduling formulas in place prior to 2002 (this remains a record for most consecutive years in which two teams not from the same division met each other).\\r\\nThe Saints won 13 of 20 games as non-division opponents. Since becoming division rivals, the Saints have the edge in the series, winning 16 games to the Bucs' 10.\\r\\nOne notable pre-division game is a 1977 matchup that resulted in Tampa Bay's first win in franchise history coming against New Orleans after previously starting out 0ÿ26 overall.\\r\\nThe Saints and the Carolina Panthers have been minor rivals since Carolina joined the league as an expansion franchise in 1995. The teams have been divisional rivals since then, originally in the NFC West and then in the NFC South since 2002. This series has been extremely close. As of the end of the 2017 regular season Carolina leads 24ÿ23.\\r\\nCarolina defeated New Orleans on the road every year from 2002 to 2008, a streak of seven seasons. Notable games include Carolina's 19ÿ7 home victory in 1996 that sparked Saints head coach Jim Mora's infamous \\"Diddley Poo\\" rant and resignation from the team, Carolina's 10ÿ6 win in the 2002 season finale at the Superdome to knock the Saints out of the playoffs, and the emotional 2005 season opener at Carolina where the Saints won 23ÿ20 in the face of Hurricane Katrina and an eventual 3ÿ13 season. After the bounty scandal broke, it was revealed that the Saints had deliberately targeted Panthers rookie quarterback Cam Newton.\\r\\nIn their last game in the 2014 NFL season, a fight between the players broke out in the end zone and spilled out into the tunnel entrance after a Cam Newton touchdown, with Panther's tight end Brandon Williams getting ejected and both teams receiving offsetting penalties. The Panthers won the contest 41ÿ10, with early turnovers by the Saints being a factor in the blowout.[28]\\r\\nOn January 7, 2018 the two teams met in the NFL Playoffs for the first time. The Saints beat Carolina, 31-26, in the Wild Card round thus eliminating Carolina.\\r\\nThe New Orleans Saints' rivalry with NFC counterparts Dallas Cowboys is more of a regional rivalry rather than a divisional one as the two franchises have never competed in the same division since the last time both clubs were in the same division, in 1969, as a part of the NFL Capital Division, before the AFLÿNFL merger in 1970. Their fanbases overlap in parts of northern Louisiana, such as the Shreveport ÿ Bossier City metropolitan area which borders the state of Texas.[29][30]\\r\\nThe teams have played each other 28 times, with New Orleans owning the recent series winning 8 out of the last 10 games. The Saints have won 4 of the last 5 meetings in Dallas, with a 2ÿ1 record at Cowboys Stadium. The all-time series record stands at 12ÿ16, in favor of Dallas. The two teams most recently met on October 4, 2015, which the Saints won 26ÿ20 in overtime in New Orleans. In the teams' most recent meeting at the Superdome, the Saints set a National Football League record of 40 first downs and a franchise record of 625 yards of total offense with Texas native Drew Brees throwing four touchdown passes without any interceptions for the 15th time in his career.[31] Additionally, the Saints' defensive coordinator was Rob Ryan, who had been let go by the Cowboys earlier that year, and Ryan's replacement Monte Kiffin was demoted from the position at the end of the 2013 season.\\r\\nNote: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\\r\\n** The Saints were designated as the home team for this game.\\r\\nUntil the selection of Rickey Jackson in 2010, there had been no players in the Hall of Fame who earned their credentials primarily as Saints; the others were chosen for their work with previous teams. However, Jim Finks's tenure as Saints general manager was a significant factor in his selection. When offensive tackle Willie Roaf was selected in 2012, he became the second Saint to earn his Hall of Fame credentials mostly while in New Orleans. Roaf was a member of the NFL's All-Decade team of the 90s.[33]\\r\\nThe following Saints players have been named to at least one Pro Bowl:\\r\\n[34][35]\\r\\nOn October 9, 2013, the Saints announced the creation of a Ring of Honor to commemorate former players, administrators and individuals with significant contributions to the franchise.[36] Their names are displayed along the Mercedes-Benz Superdome's Terrace Level fascia.[36] The first three honorees were Archie Manning, Rickey Jackson and Willie Roaf and were officially inducted during halftime of the Saints' game against the Dallas Cowboys on November 10, 2013.[37]\\r\\nTo commemorate the club's 45th anniversary, the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame selected its All-45th Anniversary Team. The Hall of Fame updates its all-time team every five years, and this latest squad of head coach and players features four standouts from the club's roster at the time of selection: QB Drew Brees, G Jahri Evans, and DE Will Smith as well as head coach Sean Payton.\\r\\nThe players are chosen in a vote by the Hall of Fame media selection committee, which includes local and regional media members who cover the Saints now or did so in the past. The All-45th Anniversary Team is as follows, with an asterisk (*) designating those players who have already been inducted into the Hall of Fame:\\r\\nOffense\\r\\nSpecialists\\r\\nDefense\\r\\nCoach\\r\\n* Unanimous selection\\r\\n1 2005 induction ceremonies postponed to October 27, 2006, due to Hurricane Katrina\\r\\nNote: Statistics are correct through the 2017 NFL season.\\r\\nL Coaching Staff\\r\\nL Management\\r\\nL More NFL staffs\\r\\nThe Joe Gemelli Fleur-De-Lis Award award is given yearly to a person who has contributed to the betterment of the New Orleans Saints organization.[57] The award is named for Joe Gemelli, a New Orleans clothing store owner and an active supporter of sports in the city, who was known as the team's biggest fan.[58]\\r\\nRunning backs\\r\\nWide receivers\\r\\nTight ends\\r\\nDefensive linemen\\r\\nDefensive backs\\r\\nSpecial teams\\r\\nUnrestricted FAs\\r\\nRestricted FAs\\r\\nExclusive-Rights FAs\\r\\nRoster updated February 27, 2018\\r\\nDepth chart ?

McAllister succeeded another former Saints running back, Hokie Gajan, in the role after Gajan's death on April 11, 2016, from liposarcoma.[66] Henderson has been the play-by-play announcer for Saints radio broadcasts continuously since 1993, and previously held the position from 1986ÿ89. Previous color commentators include former Saints players Archie Manning (QB, 1971ÿ82) and Stan Brock (OT, 1980ÿ91).\\r\\nMost preseason games are televised by WVUE (Channel 8), a station which has been owned by a consortium led by Saints owner Tom Benson since mid-2008, and, as the Fox affiliate for New Orleans, carries the majority of Saints games; both stations also carry a heavy complement of coach and player shows. Tim Brando and Jon Stinchcomb call the preseason games for the Saints .\\r\\nSaints preseason games were previously produced by Cox Sports Television. Beginning in the 2015 season, owing to Raycom Media's management of the station on behalf of Tom Benson's ownership group, production of preseason telecasts were taken over by Raycom Sports under a new multi-year deal, and syndicated to Raycom stations and others around the team's footprint.[67] Regular season games are aired on WWL-TV, the local CBS station whenever they host an AFC opponent (and games vs. NFC opponents cross-flexed from Fox to CBS) and NBC affiliate WDSU via Sunday Night Football.","input":"What conference are the new orleans saints in?"},{"output":"in Philadelphia","context":"","input":"What was the first police department created in the united states?"},{"output":"tricorne","context":"Captain Jack Sparrow is a fictional character in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. The character was created by screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, and is portrayed by Johnny Depp. The characterization of Sparrow is based on a combination of The Rolling Stones' guitarist Keith Richards and Looney Tunes cartoon character Pep Le Pew. He first appears in the 2003 film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. He later appears in the sequels Dead Man's Chest (2006), At World's End (2007), On Stranger Tides (2011), and Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017).\\r\\nIn the films, Sparrow is one of the nine pirate lords in the Brethren Court, the Pirate Lords of the Seven Seas. He can be treacherous and survives mostly by using wit and negotiation rather than by force, opting to flee most dangerous situations and to fight only when necessary. Sparrow is introduced seeking to regain his ship, the Black Pearl, from his mutinous first mate, Hector Barbossa. Later he attempts to escape his blood debt to the legendary Davy Jones while fighting the East India Trading Company.\\r\\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean series was inspired by the Disney theme park ride of the same name, and when the ride was revamped in 2006, the character of Captain Jack Sparrow was added to it. He headlined the Legend of Captain Jack Sparrow attraction at Disney's Hollywood Studios, and is the subject of spin-off novels, including a children's book series Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow, which chronicles his teenage years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Jack Sparrow first appears in The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) when he arrives in Port Royal in Jamaica to commandeer a ship. Despite rescuing Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the daughter of Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), from drowning, he is jailed for piracy. That night, a cursed pirate ship called the Black Pearl attacks Port Royal and Elizabeth is kidnapped. The Black Pearl's captain, Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), desperately seeks one last gold coin to break an ancient Aztec curse that he and his crew are under. A blacksmith named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) frees Sparrow to aid him in rescuing Elizabeth. They commandeer the HMS Interceptor and recruit a motley crew in Tortuga in Haiti before heading to Isla de Muerta, where Elizabeth is held captive. Along the way, Will learns that Sparrow was the Black Pearl's captain until Barbossa led a mutiny ten years earlier and took over the ship, marooning Sparrow on an island to die. Sparrow tells Turner that his father was a pirate known as \\"Bootstrap\\" Bill Turner.[2]\\r\\nThe rescue attempt goes awry and Barbossa maroons Jack and Elizabeth on the same island upon which he had stranded Sparrow before. Elizabeth creates a signal fire from rum barrels and they are rescued by the British Royal Navy. Sparrow cuts a deal with Commodore James Norrington (Jack Davenport) to lead Norrington to the Black Pearl. Norrington refuses until Elizabeth, desperate to save Will, spontaneously accepts Norrington's earlier marriage proposal. Right before the film's climactic battle with the pirates at Isla de Muerta, Sparrow swipes a cursed coin from the treasure chest, making himself immortal and capable of dueling Barbossa. He shoots his rival with the pistol he has carried for ten years just as Will breaks the curse, killing Barbossa. Despite having assisted the Navy, Sparrow is sentenced to hang.[2]\\r\\nAt Sparrow's execution in Port Royal, Will saves Sparrow, but they are quickly captured. Elizabeth intervenes, declaring her love for Will who is pardoned, while Sparrow escapes by tumbling off a sea wall. The Black Pearl and her new crew arrive in time to retrieve him, and he becomes captain once more. Impressed by the wily pirate, Norrington allows him one day's head start before giving chase.[2]\\r\\nA year following the events of the first film, Sparrow searches for the Dead Man's Chest, which contains the heart of Captain Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Sparrow made a bargain with Jones to raise the sunken Black Pearl and make Sparrow captain for thirteen years. Now the debt is due, and Sparrow must either serve one hundred years aboard the Flying Dutchman, or be dragged to Davy Jones's Locker by the Kraken. If he can find the Dead Man's Chest Sparrow can free his soul and control Jones and the seas.[3]\\r\\nAdding to Sparrow's woes, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company has a personal score to settle with Sparrow. Beckett wants the chest and forces Will Turner to search for Sparrow and his magic compass. Turner locates Sparrow and his crew on Pelegosto, held captive by cannibals who intend to eat Sparrow. They escape, and voyage to Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) (a magical woman later revealed to be the Goddess, Calypso, bound in human form as Dalma, and former lover of Jones). Dalma immediately sees destiny in Will, and provides Sparrow with a jar of dirt - Jones can only set foot on land once every 10 years, and since land is where Sparrow is safe, Dalma suggests with the dirt that he takes land with him.\\r\\nSparrow strikes a new deal with Jones to deliver one hundred souls in exchange for his own. Jones agrees but keeps Turner as a \\"good faith payment\\". Sparrow is recruiting sailors in Tortuga when he encounters Elizabeth Swann and James Norrington, the latter having succumbed to alcohol. Sparrow convinces Elizabeth that Turner can be freed by using the magic compass to find the chest. The duo head for Isla Cruces and find Will, who escaped Jones's ship and has stolen the key to the Chest. Turner wants to stab Jones's heart and free his father from Jones's servitude, while Norrington plots to restore his career by delivering the heart to Beckett. Sparrow wants it to convince Jones to call off the Kraken.[3]\\r\\nNorrington escapes with the heart amid a battle with Jones's crew, and Jones summons the Kraken. Realizing Sparrow is the target, Elizabeth traps him aboard the Black Pearl as the crew abandons the ship, and kisses him while she handcuffs him to the mast. Then, the monster devours Sparrow and drags the ship and his soul to Davy Jones's Locker. The surviving crew seeks refuge with Tia Dalma who produces a captain she says can rescue Sparrow: it was her doing that brought Barbossa back to life.[3]\\r\\nTwo months following the events of the second film, with Davy Jones's heart in his possession and the Flying Dutchman under his command, Cutler Beckett begins exterminating all pirates. To combat Beckett, the nine pirate lords of the Brethren Court convene at Shipwreck Cove. Only Jack Sparrow is missing, killed and sent to Davy Jones's Locker at the end of the previous film. Sparrow, as Pirate Lord of the Caribbean, must attend, as he did not bequeathe to a designated heir his \\"piece of eight\\", a pirate lord's marker. The collective \\"nine pieces of eight\\" are needed to free sea goddess Calypso to defeat Beckett. With Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner, Barbossa leads Sparrow's crew to Davy Jones's Locker using stolen navigational charts from the pirate lord Sao Feng (Chow Yun-fat). After the crew locate him, Sparrow deciphers a clue on the charts allowing them to escape the Locker.[4]\\r\\nAt the Brethren Court, Elizabeth has succeeded Captain Sao Feng as a Pirate Lord and is elected \\"Pirate King\\" after Sparrow breaks a stalemate vote. Sparrow is briefly reunited with his father, Captain Teague (Keith Richards). During a parley with Beckett and Jones, Sparrow is traded for Turner, whom Jones and Beckett had captured. When Sparrow negotiates with Beckett in the extended version of the film, it is revealed that he once sailed the Black Pearl under Beckett's command, but deserted after refusing to carry slave cargo. The Black Pearl battles the Flying Dutchman during a maelstrom created by Calypso, during which Sparrow steals Jones's heart to become immortal. When Jones mortally wounds Turner, Sparrow instead chooses to save Turner by helping him stab the heart, which kills Jones and makes Turner the Dutchman's captain. Together, the Pearl and the Dutchman destroy Beckett's ship. At the end, Barbossa again commandeers the Pearl and Sao Feng's charts, stranding Sparrow and Gibbs in Tortuga. However, Sparrow had managed to cut out the navigational section of the charts and with them begins to search for the legendary Fountain of Youth.\\r\\nAfter failing to find the Fountain of Youth, Sparrow arrives in London only to learn someone is gathering a crew by using his name. While searching for the imposter, he saves Gibbs from being hanged but is captured by the Royal Guards. They present him to King George?II. Sparrow is surprised to learn Captain Barbossa is now a privateer in the Royal Navy. Sparrow refuses to negotiate with them to locate the Fountain of Youth and escapes. Soon he crosses paths with his impersonator, an old flame named Angelica (Penlope Cruz). She shanghais him to serve aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship captained by her father Blackbeard (Ian McShane), who forces Sparrow to search for the Fountain of Youth.[4]\\r\\nSparrow fails in his attempt to take over the ship in a mutiny against Blackbeard and save the naive Angelica from her evil father. After encountering dangerous mermaids, Barbossa, and the Spanish Navy, Sparrow locates the Fountain of Youth. When Angelica is wounded, he tricks Blackbeard into sacrificing himself to save her, and Angelica blames Sparrow for her father's death. Sparrow and Angelica acknowledge their feelings for one another, but Sparrow maroons Angelica on an island, believing she may avenge her father's death. Gibbs, meanwhile, has retrieved the shrunken Black Pearl from Blackbeard's collection of shrunken ships in the hope of restoring it to normal size. Though he has forfeited his opportunity for immortality, Sparrow settles for being famous as the one who found the Fountain of Youth. Following the film's end credits, Angelica's voodoo doll of Sparrow has drifted to the island that she is marooned on.[5]\\r\\nSparrow returns in the fifth film, portrayed once again by Johnny Depp.[6] Five years after the quest for the Fountain of Youth, Jack has reassembled a small crew, but the Black Pearl is still trapped in a bottle, his new ship the Dying Gull has never left berth, and his latest plans have met with failure, while his rival, Barbossa, has became the richest and most powerful pirate of the seven seas.\\r\\nSparrow and his crew attempt to rob the new bank of St. Martin. The robbery is a success, but all the gold in it had fallen while they were dragging the locker, and Sparrow's crew abandons him. Despondent, Jack trades his magical compass for a drink. However, this betrayal of the compass releases an old enemy of Sparrow, whom holds a serious grudge against him; the ruthless undead pirate hunter Captain Salazar. Years previously, Jack had defeated Salazar by tricking him into sailing his ship into the Devil's Triangle, where Salazar and his crew were cursed to live as the undead. Salazar states that Jack perched in the ship's rigging like a \\"little bird\\", earning him the name \\"Jack the Sparrow\\". It was during this event that Jack received his compass, as well as his characteristic gear.\\r\\nWhile in prison, Jack is contacted by Henry Turner, the son of Will and Elizabeth, to seek his aid in finding the Trident of Poseidon. Remembering Elizabeth and Will from his previous misadventures, Jack agrees but not before expressing some hesitation. The next day, Sparrow is sentenced to be executed by guillotine (by Jack's accidental choosing), but is rescued by Henry and his crew. Aided by aspiring astronomer Carina, Jack and Henry attempt to locate the Trident of Poseidon, as both are in need of its power to break curses related to the sea. Barbossa releases the Pearl from its bottle, giving them a chance to outrun Salazar. Jack and Barbossa discuss the fact that Carina is in truth Barbossa's long-lost daughter, whom he had left at an orphanage in order to give her a chance for a better life. Jack attempts to use the secret to blackmail Barbossa for his compass and 216 barrels of rum, but fails.\\r\\nThey are able to track the Trident to its resting place. Though Salazar nearly kills Jack, they are able to destroy the Trident. With the destruction of the Trident, Salazar and his crew become mortal again. Jack, Henry and Carina escape as Barbossa sacrifices himself to kill Salazar. Despite their differences, Jack mourns Barbossa's death. Later, Jack watches Will and Elizabeth's reunion before he departs, the Black Pearl and his compass once again in his possession.\\r\\nWhen writing the screenplay for The Curse of the Black Pearl, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio envisioned Captain Jack Sparrow as a supporting character in the vein of Bugs Bunny and Groucho Marx.[7] The producers saw him as a young Burt Lancaster.[8] Director Gore Verbinski admitted, \\"The first film was a movie, and then Jack was put into it almost. He doesn't have the obligations of the plot in the same ways that the other characters have. He meanders his way through, and he kind of affects everybody else.\\"[9] Sparrow represents an ethical pirate, with Captain Barbossa as his corrupt foil.[7] His true motives usually remain masked, and whether he is honorable or evil depends on the audience's perspective.[10] This acts as part of Will Turner's arc, in which Sparrow tells him a pirate can be a good man, like his father.[7]\\r\\nFollowing the success of The Curse of the Black Pearl, the challenge to creating a sequel was, according to Verbinski, \\"You don't want just the Jack Sparrow movie. It's like having a garlic milkshake. He's the spice and you need a lot of straight men?... Let's not give them too much Jack. It's like too much dessert or too much of a good thing.\\"[9] Although Dead Man's Chest was written to propel the trilogy's plot,[11] Sparrow's state-of-mind as he is pursued by Davy Jones becomes increasingly edgy, and the writers concocted the cannibal sequence to show that he was in danger whether on land or at sea. Sparrow is perplexed over his attraction to Elizabeth Swann, and attempts to justify it throughout the film.[12]\\r\\nAt World's End was meant to return it tonally to a character piece. Sparrow, in particular, is tinged with madness after extended solitary confinement in Davy Jones's Locker,[11] and now desires immortality.[13] Sparrow struggles with what it takes to be a moral person,[14] after his honest streak caused his doom in the second film. This is mainly shown by his increasingly erratic behaviour and Jack's hallucinations, which appeared to be simply his deranged mind in the beginning where dozens of \\"Jack Sparrows\\" appeared to crew the ship in his solitary exile, but later the hallucinations grew more important and there were mainly two \\"Jacks\\" constantly arguing about which path to follow: the immortality or the mortality. The last hallucination took place while Jack was imprisoned on the Dutchman, where his honest streak won (possibly due to not liking his sea creature-like \\"future\\", which comedically dropped his brain and searched for it around the Brig).[15] By the end of At World's End, Sparrow is sailing to the Fountain of Youth, an early concept for the second film.[16] Rossio said in 2007 that a fourth film was possible,[17] and producer Jerry Bruckheimer expressed interest in a spin-off.[18] Gore Verbinski concurred that \\"all of the stories set in motion by the first film have been resolved. If there ever were another Pirates of the Caribbean film, I would start fresh and focus on the further adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow.\\"[19]\\r\\nOn Stranger Tides was first announced on September 28, 2008, during a Disney event at the Kodak Theater. Verbinski did not return to direct the fourth installment and was replaced by Rob Marshall. The movie uses elements from Tim Powers' novel of the same name, particularly Blackbeard and the Fountain of Youth, but the film is not a straight adaptation of the novel.[20]\\r\\nLooking to do a family film, Johnny Depp visited the Walt Disney Studios in 2001 when he heard of plans to adapt the Pirates of the Caribbean ride into a film. Depp was excited by the possibility of reviving an old Hollywood genre,[8] and found the script met his quirky sensibilities: the crew of the Black Pearl were not in search of treasure but trying to return it to lift a curse on them, and the traditional mutiny had already occurred.[21] Depp was cast on June 10, 2002.[22] Producer Jerry Bruckheimer felt Depp would give the film an edge that could draw teenage and adult audiences despite Disney's reputation for soft children's fare.[23]\\r\\nAt the first read-through, Depp surprised the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner.[24] He researched 18th-century pirates and, seeing parallels with modern rock stars, modeled his performance on Keith Richards.[23] Richards later appeared in two cameos as Jack's father, Captain Teague, in At World's End and On Stranger Tides. Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because Orlando Bloom would play the traditional Errol Flynn-type character.[21] Depp improvised the film's final line, \\"Now, bring me that horizon\\", which the writer called his favorite line.[24] Disney executives were initially confused by Depp's performance, questioning whether the character was drunk or gay. While watching the rushes, Disney CEO Michael Eisner proclaimed Depp was ruining the film.[24] Depp's response to Disney executives was they could trust him with his choices or let him go.[23] Many industry insiders questioned Depp's casting, as he was an unconventional actor not known for working within the traditional studio system.[25]\\r\\nDepp's performance won acclaim from film critics. Alan Morrison found it \\"Gloriously over-the-top?... In terms of physical precision and verbal delivery, it's a master-class in comedy acting.\\"[26] Roger Ebert praised Depp for drawing away from the character as written and found Depp's performance \\"original in its every atom. There has never been a pirate, or for that matter a human being, like this in any other movie?... his behavior shows a lifetime of rehearsal\\".[27] Depp won a Screen Actor's Guild award for his performance, and was nominated for a Golden Globe[28] and the Academy Award for Best Actor, the first in his career.[29] Film School Rejects argued the film made Depp as much a movie star as he was a character actor.[30]\\r\\nDepp's return in Dead Man's Chest was the first time he had ever made a sequel.[24] Drew McWeeny wrote, \\"Remember how cool Han Solo was in Star Wars the first time you saw it? And then remember how much cooler he seemed when Empire came out? This is that big a jump.\\"[31] Depp received an MTV Movie Award[32] and a Teen Choice Award for Dead Man's Chest, and was nominated for an Empire Award and another Golden Globe.[33] For his performance in At World's End, Depp won an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance, as well as a People's Choice Award, a Kids' Choice Award, and another Teen Choice Award. He has signed on to reprise the role for future sequels.[34]\\r\\nDepp wears a dreadlock wig in a rock-and-roll approach to a pirate aesthetic.[35] He wears a red bandanna and numerous objects in his hair, influenced by Keith Richards' habit of collecting souvenirs from his travels;[36] Sparrow's decorations include his \\"piece of eight\\".[4] Sparrow wears kohl around his eyes, which was inspired by Depp's study of nomads, whom he compared to pirates,[37] and he wore contacts that acted as sunglasses.[38] Sparrow has several gold teeth, two of which belong to Depp,[39] although they were applied during filming. Depp initially forgot to have them removed after shooting The Curse of the Black Pearl,[40] and wore them throughout the shooting of the sequels.[8] Like all aspects of Depp's performance, Disney initially expressed great concern over Depp's teeth.[12] Sparrow wears his goatee in two braids. Initially wire was used in them, but the wires were abandoned because they made the braids stick up when Depp lay down.[41] Sparrow has numerous tattoos,[4] and has been branded a pirate on his right arm by Cutler Beckett,[3] underneath a tattoo of a sparrow.[2]\\r\\nDepp collaborated with costume designer Penny Rose on his character's appearance, handpicking a tricorne as Sparrow's signature leather hat; to make Sparrow's unique, the other characters did not wear leather hats. A rubber version was used for the scene in Dead Man's Chest when the hat floats on water.[42] Depp liked to stick to one costume, wearing one lightweight silk tweed frock coat throughout the series,[43] and he had to be coaxed out of wearing his boots for a version without a sole or heel in beach scenes.[44] The official line is that none of the costumes from The Curse of the Black Pearl survived, which allowed the opportunity to create tougher linen shirts for stunts.[45] However, one remains which has been displayed in an exhibition of screen costumes in Worcester, England.[46] It was a nightmare for Rose to track down the same makers of Sparrow's sash in Turkey. Rose did not want to silkscreen it, as the homewoven piece had the correct worn feel.[47] Sparrow wears an additional belt in the sequels, because Depp liked a new buckle which did not fit with the original piece.[48]\\r\\nSparrow's weapons are genuine 18th century pieces: his sword dates to the 1740s and his pistol is from the 1760s. Both were made in London.[38][49] Depp used two pistols on set, one of rubber. Both survived production of the first film.[50] Sparrow's magic compass also survived into the sequels, though director Gore Verbinski had a red arrow added to the dial as it became a more prominent prop. As it does not act like a normal compass, a magnet was used to make it spin.[51] Sparrow wears four rings, two of which belong to Depp. Depp bought the green ring in 1989 and the gold ring is a replica of a 2400-year-old ring Depp gave to the crew, though the original was later stolen. The other two are props to which Depp gave backstories: the gold-and-black ring is stolen from a Spanish widow Sparrow seduced and the green dragon ring recalls his adventures in the Far East.[52] Among Depp's additional ideas was the necklace made of human toes that Sparrow wears as the Pelegosto prepare to eat him,[53] and the sceptre was based on one a friend of Depp's owned.[54]\\r\\nDuring the course of the trilogy, Sparrow undergoes physical transformations. In The Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow curses himself to battle the undead Barbossa. Like all the actors playing the Black Pearl crew, Depp had to shoot scenes in costume as a reference for the animators, and his shots as a skeleton were shot again without him. Depp reprised the scene again on a motion capture stage.[38] In At World's End, Sparrow hallucinates a version of himself as a member of Davy Jones's crew, adhered to a wall and encrusted with barnacles. Verbinski oversaw that the design retained Sparrow's distinctive look,[55] and rejected initial designs which portrayed him as over 100 years old.[56]\\r\\nAccording to screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, Sparrow is a trickster who uses wit and deceit to attain his goals, preferring to end disputes verbally instead of by force.[57] He walks with a slightly drunken swagger and has slurred speech and flailing hand gestures. Sparrow is shrewd, calculating, and eccentric. He fools Norrington and his crew to set sail on the royal ship Interceptor, which compels the admiration of Lieutenant Groves as he concedes: \\"That's got to be the best pirate I have ever seen\\". Norrington himself acquiesces to this praise: \\"So it would seem\\", in sharp contrast to what he had previously proclaimed: \\"You are without doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of\\". In the third film, while he leaves Beckett's ship stranded and makes off, Lieutenant Groves asks him: \\"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\\"[4]\\r\\nThough a skilled swordsman, Sparrow prefers to use his superior intelligence during combat, exploiting his environment to turn the tables on his foes, reasoning \\"Why fight when you can negotiate?\\" He uses strategies of non-violent negotiation and turning his enemies against each other.[3] He invokes parleys and tempts his enemies away from their murderous intentions, encouraging them to see the bigger picture, as he does when he persuades Barbossa to delay returning to mortal form so he can battle the Royal Navy.[2] He often uses complex wordplay and vocabulary to confound his enemies,[2][3] and it is suggested that his pacifism may be one reason Barbossa and the crew of the Black Pearl mutinied.[2]\\r\\nThe character is portrayed as having created, or at least contributed to, his own reputation. When Gibbs tells Will that Sparrow escaped from a desert island by strapping two sea turtles together, Sparrow embellishes the story by claiming the rope was made from hair from his own back, while in reality, Sparrow escaped the island by bartering with rum traders. The video game Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow bases itself on these tall tales, including the sacking of Nassau port without firing a shot.[2] Depp has likened pirates to rock stars in that their fame preceded them.[57] Sparrow insists on being addressed as \\"Captain\\"[2] and often gives the farewell, \\"This is the day you will always remember as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow!\\" which is sometimes humorously cut off.[2][3] When Norrington accuses him of being the worst pirate he has ever heard of, Sparrow replies, \\"But you have heard of me.\\"[2] In a deleted scene from The Curse of the Black Pearl Sparrow ponders being \\"the immortal Captain Jack Sparrow\\",[58] and during At World's End he again is interested in immortality, although his father, Captain Teague, warns it can be a terrible curse. Sparrow ponders being \\"Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate,\\" as the East India Trading Company purges piracy.[4]\\r\\nDespite his many heroics, Sparrow is a pirate and a morally ambiguous character.[14] When agreeing to trade 100 souls, including Will, to Davy Jones in exchange for his freedom, Jones asks Sparrow whether he can, \\"condemn an innocent mana friendto a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?\\" After a hesitation Sparrow merrily replies, \\"Yep! I'm good with it!\\"[3] He carelessly runs up debts with Anamaria,[2] Davy Jones, and the other pirate lords.[4] Sao Feng, pirate lord of Singapore, is particularly hateful towards him.[4] In a cowardly moment, Sparrow abandons his crew during the Kraken's attack, but underlying loyalty and morality compel him to return and save them.[59] Sparrow claims to be a man of his word,[2] and expresses surprise that people doubt his truthfulness;[3] there is no murder on his criminal record.[1][2]\\r\\nDepp partly based the character on Pep Le Pew, a womanizing skunk from Looney Tunes.[8] Sparrow claims to have a \\"tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature,\\"[3] although his conquests are often left with a sour memory of him. Former flames, Scarlett and Giselle, usually slap him[2] or anyone looking for him.[3] His witty charm easily attracts women, and even has Elizabeth questioning her feelings.[3] Verbinski noted phallic connotations in Sparrow's relationship with his vessel, as he grips the ship's wheel.[21] The Black Pearl is described as \\"the only ship which can outrun the Flying Dutchman\\".[4] The Freudian overtones continue in the third film when Sparrow and Barbossa battle for captaincy of the Black Pearl, showing off the length of their telescopes, and in a deleted scene, they fight over the steering wheel.[60] Sparrow claims his \\"first and only love is the sea,\\"[3] and describes his ship as representing freedom.[2] Davy Jones's Locker is represented as a desert, symbolizing his personal hell.[12]\\r\\nCaptain Jack Sparrow has become one of the most iconic film characters of all time. When Dead Man's Chest grossed over $1 billion worldwide, Ian Nathan attributed this to Sparrow's popularity: \\"Pirates, the franchise, only had to turn up. There was a powerful holdover from the cheeky delights of its debut, something we hadn't felt since the Clone Wars called it a day.\\"[61] Empire in 2006 declared Depp's performance the seventy-fourth \\"thing that rocked our world\\" and later named him the eighth greatest movie character of all time.[62] In 2015, a new poll of the 100 greatest film characters of all time placed him as the fourteenth greatest.[63] A survey of more than 3,000 people showed Jack Sparrow was the most popular Halloween costume of 2006,[64] and a 2007 poll held by the Internet Movie Database showed Sparrow to be the second most popular live action hero after Indiana Jones.[65] In a 2007 Pearl?& Dean poll, Jack Sparrow was listed as Depp's most popular performance.[66]\\r\\nTodd Gilchrist feels Sparrow is the only element of the films that will remain timeless.[67] According to Sharon Eberson, the character's popularity can be attributed to his being a \\"scoundrel whose occasional bouts of conscience allow viewers to go with the flaws because, as played to the larger-than-life hilt by Depp, he owns every scene he is in\\".[68] Film history professor Jonathan Kuntz attributed Sparrow's popularity to the increased questioning of masculinity in the 21st century, and Sparrow's personality contrasts with action-adventure heroes in cinema. Leonard Maltin concurs that Sparrow has a carefree attitude and does not take himself seriously.[69] Mark Fox noted Sparrow is an escapist fantasy figure for women, free from much of the responsibility of most heroes.[70] Sparrow is listed by IGN as one of their ten favorite film outlaws, as he \\"lives for himself and the freedom to do whatever it is that he damn well pleases. Precious few film characters have epitomized what makes the outlaw such a romantic figure for audiences as Captain Jack Sparrow has.\\"[71] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, \\"best-of\\" list, saying, \\"Part Keith Richards rift, part sozzled lounge lizard, Johnny Depp's swizzleshtick pirate was definitely one of the most dazzling characters of the decade.\\"[72] In June 2010, Sparrow was named one of Entertainment Weekly's 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years.[73]\\r\\nJack Sparrow also appears in video games and books spun off the Pirates of the Caribbean media franchise, among them Kingdom Hearts II, where he is voiced by James Arnold Taylor. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Complete Visual Guide gives a backstory to Sparrow in which he was born on a pirate ship during a typhoon in the Indian Ocean and was trained to fence by an Italian.[74] Books following Sparrow's adventures before the events of the film include a twelve-book series focusing on his teenage years entitled Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow,[75] and a five-books Pirates of the Caribbean: Legends of the Brethren Court series.[76] In 2011, Ann?C. Crispin wrote a novel titled Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom, which follows Jack's adventures as a merchant captain for the East India Trading Company.[77]\\r\\nIn 2011, comedy group the Lonely Island, in collaboration with ballad singer Michael Bolton, released a song named for Jack.[78]","input":"What kind of hat does jack sparrow wear?"},{"output":"Louis XVI","context":"","input":"Who was the last person to live in versaille?"},{"output":"primarily in the month of July","context":"","input":"When does the tour de france take place?"},{"output":"July 4, 1776","context":"","input":"When did we declare our independence from england?"},{"output":"chrome yellow","context":"School bus yellow is a color which was especially formulated for use on school buses in North America in 1939. The color is now officially known in Canada and the U.S. as National School Bus Glossy Yellow and was originally called National School Bus Chrome. The pigment used for this color was, for a long time, the lead-containing chrome yellow.[1]\\r\\nThe color was chosen because it attracts attention and is noticed quickly in peripheral vision, faster than any other color. Scientists describe this as follows: \\"Lateral peripheral vision for detecting yellows is 1.24 times greater than for red.\\"[2]\\r\\nIn April 1939, Dr. Frank W. Cyr, a professor at Teachers College, Columbia University in New York organized a conference that established national school-bus construction standards for the U.S., including the standard color of yellow for the school bus. It became known officially as \\"National School Bus Chrome\\". The color was selected because black lettering on that hue was easiest to see in the semi-darkness of early morning.\\r\\nThe conference met for seven days and the attendees created a total of 44 standards, including specifications regarding body length, ceiling height and aisle width. Paint experts from DuPont and Pittsburgh Paints participated. Dr. Cyr's conference, funded by a $5,000 grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, was also a landmark event inasmuch as it included transportation officials from each of the then-48 states, as well as specialists from school bus manufacturing and paint companies. The color was adopted by the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) as Federal Standard No. 595a, Color 13432.\\r\\nThe conference approach to school bus safety, as well as the yellow color, have endured into the 21st century. Dr. Cyr became known as the \\"Father of the Yellow School Bus.\\"\\r\\nThe yellow color of other public vehicles, including taxicabs, did not derive from Dr. Cyr's standardization. Rather, it was from a much earlier choice made by Chicago-based entrepreneur John D. Hertz, who founded the Yellow Cab Company in 1914, and used the color to brand his business. Hertz's later car rental company would also use the bright yellow shade as part of its logo, which is still in use today. It is not known[according to whom?] whether or to what extent Hertz's choice influenced Dr. Cyr's conception, or whether Hertz himself had the same concerns about visibility in mind that Dr. Cyr had.\\r\\nThe yellow used on Beijing \\"breadloaf\\" or \\"miandi\\" taxis shown in the photo below was likely influenced by yellow taxicabs in the US.[original research?]\\r\\nIn Sweden yellow buses were operated as postbuses in sparsely populated regions by the Swedish Postal Service from 1923 to 1991, i.e., since before \\"school bus yellow\\" was created in 1939 (see image in gallery), with the color chosen because it was the traditional color of the Swedish Postal Service, and as such was the color used on both post boxes and vehicles. Other national postal services in Europe, including in Germany and Switzerland, also operated yellow buses for the same reason, since long before 1939, and some still do.[citation needed]\\r\\nSchool bus yellow is also the traditional color of long-distance coaches and intercity buses used in Hungary.\\r\\nNorth American-style yellow school buses (built by European manufacturers) are being introduced in some parts of the United Kingdom, prompted by corporate links to the American industry, for example First Student UK, or a desire to re-brand school buses, such as West Yorkshire Metro's Mybus.[3]\\r\\nA similar shade of yellow was used in Santiago, Chile's bus lines between 1992 and 2007.\\r\\nSwedish Scania-Vabis postbus from mid-1920s\\r\\nGerman postbus from 1925\\r\\nGerman Reichspost parcel delivery van from mid-1920s\\r\\nNineteenth century German Reichspost mail coach for both passengers and mail\\r\\nGerman postbus (1980's)\\r\\nSwiss Saurer postbus from 1953\\r\\nA First Student UK school bus painted in American school bus yellow\\r\\nA Hong Kong nanny van in yellow (but see note above about Hertz and taxicabs)","input":"What color is a school bus yellow or orange?"},{"output":"on the walls of Christian tombs in the catacombs of Rome","context":"Early Christian art and architecture or Paleochristian art is the art produced by Christians or under Christian patronage from the earliest period of Christianity to, depending on the definition used, sometime between 260 and 525. In practice, identifiably Christian art only survives from the 2nd century onwards.[1] After 550 at the latest, Christian art is classified as Byzantine, or of some other regional type.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is hard to know when distinctly Christian art began. Prior to 100, Christians may have been constrained by their position as a persecuted group from producing durable works of art. Since Christianity was largely a religion of the lower classes in this period[citation needed], the lack of surviving art may reflect a lack of funds for patronage, and simply small numbers of followers. The Old Testament restrictions against the production of graven (an idol or fetish carved in wood or stone) images (see also Idolatry and Christianity) may also have constrained Christians from producing art. Christians may have made or purchased art with pagan iconography, but given it Christian meanings, as they later did.  If this happened, \\"Christian\\" art would not be immediately recognizable as such.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Christianity used the same artistic media as the surrounding pagan culture. These media included fresco, mosaics, sculpture, and manuscript illumination. Early Christian art not only used Roman forms, it also used Roman styles. Late classical style included a proportional portrayal of the human body and impressionistic presentation of space. Late classical style is seen in early Christian frescos, such as those in the Catacombs of Rome, which include most examples of the earliest Christian art.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Christian art and architecture adapted Roman artistic motifs and gave new meanings to what had been pagan symbols. Among the motifs adopted were the peacock, grapevines, and the \\"Good Shepherd\\". Early Christians also developed their own iconography, for example, such symbols as the fish (ikhthus), were not borrowed from pagan iconography.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Christian art is generally divided into two periods by scholars: before and after either the Edict of Milan of 313, bringing the so-called Triumph of the Church under Constantine, or the First Council of Nicea in 325.  The earlier period being called the Pre-Constantinian or Ante-Nicene Period and after being the period of the First seven Ecumenical Councils.[4]  The end of the period of Early Christian art, which is typically defined by art historians as being in the 5thÿ7th centuries, is thus a good deal later than the end of the period of Early Christianity as typically defined by theologians and church historians, which is more often considered to end under Constantine, around 313ÿ325.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the persecution of Christians under the Roman Empire, Christian art was necessarily and deliberately furtive and ambiguous, using imagery that was shared with pagan culture but had a special meaning for Christians. The earliest surviving Christian art comes from the late 2nd to early 4th centuries on the walls of Christian tombs in the catacombs of Rome.  From literary evidence, there may well have been panel icons which, like almost all classical painting, have disappeared.  Initially Jesus was represented indirectly by pictogram symbols such as the Ichthys (fish), peacock, Lamb of God, or an anchor (the Labarum or Chi-Rho was a later development).  Later personified symbols were used, including Jonah, whose three days in the belly of the whale pre-figured the interval between the death and resurrection of Jesus, Daniel in the lion's den, or Orpheus' charming the animals. The image of \\"The Good Shepherd\\", a beardless youth in pastoral scenes collecting sheep, was the most common of these images, and was probably not understood as a portrait of the historical Jesus.[5] These images bear some resemblance to depictions of kouros figures in Greco-Roman art.  The \\"almost total absence from Christian monuments of the period of persecutions of the plain, unadorned cross\\" except in the disguised form of the anchor,[6] is notable.  The Cross, symbolizing Jesus' crucifixion on a cross, was not represented explicitly for several centuries, possibly because crucifixion was a punishment meted out to common criminals, but also because literary sources noted that it was a symbol recognised as specifically Christian, as the sign of the cross was made by Christians from very early on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe popular conception that the Christian catacombs were \\"secret\\" or had to hide their affiliation is probably wrong; catacombs were large-scale commercial enterprises, usually sited just off major roads to the city, whose existence was well known.  The inexplicit symbolic nature of many early Christian visual motifs may have had a function of discretion in other contexts, but on tombs they probably reflect a lack of any other repertoire of Christian iconography.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dove is a symbol of peace and purity. It can be found with a halo or celestial light. In one of the earliest known Trinitarian images, \\"the Throne of God as a Trinitarian image\\" (a marble relief carved c. 400 CE in the collection of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation), the dove represents the Spirit. It is flying above an empty throne representing God, in the throne are a chlamys (cloak) and diadem representing the Son.  The Chi-Rho monogram, XP, apparently first used by Constantine I, consists of the first two characters of the name 'Christos' in Greek.\\r\\n\\r\\nA general assumption that Early Christianity was generally aniconic, opposed to religious imagery in both theory and practice until about 200, has been challenged by Paul Corby Finney's analysis of Early Christian writing and material remains (1994).  This distinguishes three different sources of attitudes affecting Early Christians on the issue: \\"first that humans could have a direct vision of God; second that they could not; and, third, that although humans could see God they were best advised not to look, and were strictly forbidden to represent what they had seen\\".  These derived respectively from Greek and Near Eastern pagan religions, from Ancient Greek philosophy, and from the Jewish tradition and the Old Testament. Of the three, Finney concludes that \\"overall, Israel's aversion to sacred images influenced early Christianity considerably less than the Greek philosophical tradition of invisible deity apophatically defined\\", so placing less emphasis on the Jewish background of most of the first Christians than most traditional accounts.[8]  Finney suggests that \\"the reasons for the non-appearance of Christian art before 200 have nothing to do with principled aversion to art, with other-worldliness, or with anti-materialism. The truth is simple and mundane: Christians lacked land and capital. Art requires both. As soon as they began to acquire land and capital, Christians began to experiment with their own distinctive forms of art\\".[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Dura-Europos church, of about 230ÿ256, which is in the best condition of the surviving very early churches, there are frescos of biblical scenes including a figure of Jesus, as well as Christ as the Good Shepherd.  The building was a normal house apparently converted to use as a church.[10] The earliest Christian paintings in the Catacombs of Rome are from a few decades before, and these represent the largest body of examples of Christian art from the pre-Constantinian period, with hundreds of examples decorating tombs or family tomb-chambers. Many are simple symbols, but there are numerous figure paintings either showing orants or female praying figures, usually representing the deceased person, or figures or shorthand scenes from the bible or Christian history.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe style of the catacomb paintings, and the entirety of many decorative elements, are effectively identical to those of the catacombs of other religious groups, whether conventional pagans following Ancient Roman religion, or Jews or followers of the Roman mystery religions.  The quality of the painting is low compared to the large houses of the rich, which provide the other main corpus of painting surviving from the period, but the shorthand depiction of figures can have an expressive charm.[11]  A similar situation applies at Dura-Europos, where the decoration of the church is comparable in style and quality to that of the (larger and more lavishly painted) Dura-Europos synagogue and the Temple of Bel. At least in such smaller places, it seems that the available artists were used by all religious groups. It may also have been the case that the painted chambers in the cattacombs were decorated in similar style to the best rooms of the homes of the better-off families buried in them,  with Christian scenes and symbols replacing those from mythology, literature, paganism and eroticism, although we lack the evidence to confirm this.[12]  We do have the same scenes on small pieces in media such as pottery or glass,[13] though less often from this pre-Constantinian period.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a preference for what are sometimes called \\"abbreviated\\" representations, small groups of say one to four figures forming a single motif which could be easily recognised as representing a particular incident. These vignettes fitted the Roman style of room decoration, set in compartments in a scheme with a geometrical structure (see gallery below).[14]  Biblical scenes of figures rescued from mortal danger were very popular; these represented both the Resurrection of Jesus, through typology, and the salvation of the soul of the deceased. Jonah and the whale,[15] the Sacrifice of Isaac, Noah praying in the Ark (represented as an orant in a large box, perhaps with a dove carrying a branch), Moses striking the rock, Daniel in the lion's den and the Three Youths in the Fiery Furnace ([Daniel 3:10ÿ30]) were all favourites, that could be easily depicted.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Christian sarcophagi were a much more expensive option, made of marble and often heavily decorated with scenes in very high relief, worked with drills. Free-standing statues that are unmistakably Christian are very rare, and never very large, as more common subjects such as the Good Shepherd were symbols appealing to several religious and philosophical groups, including Christians, and without context no affiliation can be given to them.  Typically sculptures, where they appear, are of rather high quality. One exceptional group that seems clearly Christian is known as the Cleveland Statuettes of Jonah and the Whale,[17] and consists of a group of small statuettes of about 270, including two busts of a young and fashionably dressed couple, from an unknown find-spot, possibly in modern Turkey.  The other figures tell the story of Jonah in four pieces, with a Good Shepherd; how they were displayed remains mysterious.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe depiction of Jesus was well-developed by the end of the pre-Constantinian period. He was typically shown in narrative scenes, with a preference for New Testament miracles, and few of scenes from his Passion.  A variety of different types of appearance were used, including the thin long-faced figure with long centrally-parted hair that was later to become the norm. But in the earliest images as many show a stocky and short-haired beardless figure in a short tunic, who can only be identified by his context. In many images of miracles Jesus carries a stick or wand, which he points at the subject of the miracle rather like a modern stage magician (though the wand is a good deal larger).\\r\\n\\r\\nSaints are fairly often seen, with Peter and Paul, both martyred in Rome, by some way the most common in the catacombs there. Both already have their distinctive appearances, retained throughout the history of Christian art. Other saints may not be identifiable unless labelled with an inscription.  In the same way some images may represent either the Last Supper or a contemporary agape feast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Three Youths in the Fiery Furnace ([Daniel 3:10ÿ30]), catacomb of Priscilla[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses striking the rock in the desert, a prototype of baptism[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n3rd century cover for catacomb burial, engraved with the Adoration of the Magi (cast shown)\\r\\n\\r\\nCatacomb chamber with (from top): Orants, Jonah and the Whale, Moses striking the rock (left), Noah praying in the ark, Adoration of the Magi. 200ÿ250\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 4th century, the rapidly growing Christian population, now supported by the state, needed to build larger and grander public buildings for worship than the mostly discreet meeting places they had been using, which were typically in or among domestic buildings. Pagan temples remained in use for their original purposes for some time and, at least in Rome, even when deserted were shunned by Christians until the 6th or 7th centuries, when some were converted to churches.[21] Elsewhere this happened sooner.  Architectural formulas for temples were unsuitable, not simply for their pagan associations, but because pagan cult and sacrifices occurred outdoors under the open sky in the sight of the gods, with the temple, housing the cult figures and the treasury, as a windowless backdrop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe usable model at hand, when Emperor Constantine I wanted to memorialize his imperial piety, was the familiar conventional architecture of the basilica.  There were several variations of the basic plan of the secular basilica, always some kind of rectangular hall, but the one usually followed for churches had a center nave with one aisle at each side, and an apse at one end opposite to the main door at the other. In, and often also in front of, the apse was a raised platform, where the altar was placed and the clergy officiated.  In secular buildings this plan was more typically used for the smaller audience halls of the emperors, governors, and the very rich than for the great public basilicas functioning as law courts and other public purposes.[22]  This was the normal pattern used for Roman churches, and generally in the Western Empire, but the Eastern Empire, and Roman Africa, were more adventurous, and their models were sometimes copied in the West, for example in Milan.  All variations allowed natural light from windows high in the walls, a departure from the windowless sanctuaries of the temples of most previous religions, and this has remained a consistent feature of Christian church architecture. Formulas giving churches with a large central area were to become preferred in Byzantine architecture, which developed styles of basilica with a dome early on.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nA particular and short-lived type of building, using the same basilican form, was the funerary hall, which was not a normal church, though the surviving examples long ago became regular churches, and they always offered funeral and memorial services, but a building erected in the Constantinian period as an indoor cemetery on a site connected with early Christian martyrs, such as a catacomb.  The six examples built by Constantine outside the walls of Rome are: Old Saint Peter's Basilica, the older basilica dedicated to Saint Agnes of which Santa Costanza is now the only remaining element, San Sebastiano fuori le mura, San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, Santi Marcellino e Pietro al Laterano, and one in the modern park of Villa Gordiani.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nA martyrium was a building erected on a spot with particular significance, often over the burial of a martyr. No particular architectural form was associated with the type, and they were often small. Many became churches, or chapels in larger churches erected adjoining them.  With baptistries and mausolea, their often smaller size and different function made martyria suitable for architectural experimentation.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the key buildings, not all surviving in their original form, are:\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the final legalization of Christianity, the existing styles of Christian art continued to develop, and take on a more monumental and iconic character.  Before long very large Christian churches began to be constructed, and the majority of the rich elite adapted Christianity, and public and elite Christian art became grander to suit the new spaces and clients.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough borrowings of motifs such as the Virgin and Child from pagan religious art had been pointed out as far back as the Protestant Reformation, when John Calvin and his followers gleefully used them as a stick with which to beat all Christian art, the belief of Andr Grabar, Andreas Alf?ldi, Ernst Kantorowicz and other early 20th-century art historians that Roman Imperial imagery was a much more significant influence \\"has become universally accepted\\".  A book by Thomas F. Mathews in 1994 attempted to overturn this thesis, very largely denying influence from Imperial iconography in favour of a range of other secular and religious influence, but was roughly handled by academic reviewers.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore complex and expensive works are seen, as the wealthy gradually converted, and more theological complexity appears, as Christianity became subject to acrimonious doctrinal disputes. At the same time a very different type of art is found in the new public churches that were now being constructed.  Somewhat by accident, the best group of survivals of these is from Rome where, together with Constantinople and Jesusalem, they were presumably at their most magnificent. Mosaic now becomes important; fortunately this survives far better than fresco, although it is vulnerable to well-meaning restoration and repair. It seems to have been an innovation of early Christian churches to put mosaics on the wall and use them for sacred subjects; previously the technique had essentially been used for floors and walls in gardens.  By the end of the period the style of gold background had developed that continued to characterize Byzantine images, and many Early Medieval Western ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith more space, narrative images containing many people develop in churches, and also begin to be seen in later catacomb paintings. Continuous rows of biblical scenes appear (rather high up) along the side walls of churches. The best-preserved 5th century examples are the set of Old Testament scenes along the nave walls of  Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome.  These can be compared to the paintings of Dura-Europos, and probably also derive from a lost tradition of both Jewish and Christian illustrated manuscripts, as well as more general Roman precedents.[28]  The large apses contain images in an iconic style, which gradually developed to centre on a large figure, or later just the bust, of Christ, or later of the Virgin Mary. The earliest apses show a range of compositions that are new symbolic images of the Christian life and the Church.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo panel paintings, or \\"icons\\" from before the 6th century have survived in anything like an original condition, but they were clearly produced, and becoming more important throughout this period.\\r\\n\\r\\nSculpture, all much smaller than lifesize, has survived in better quantities.  The most famous of a considerable number of surviving Early Christian sarcophagi are perhaps the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus and Dogmatic sarcophagus of the 4th century.  A number of ivory carvings have survived, including the complex late 5th century Brescia Casket, probably a product of Saint Ambrose's episcopate in Milan, then the seat of the Imperial court, and the 6th century Throne of Maximian from the Byzantine Italian capital of Ravenna. \\r\\n\\r\\nGold sandwich glass or gold glass was a technique for fixing a layer of gold leaf with a design between two fused layers of glass, developed in Hellenistic glass and revived in the 3rd century.  There are a very fewer larger designs, but the great majority of the around 500 survivals are roundels that are the cut-off bottoms of wine cups or glasses used to mark and decorate graves in the Catacombs of Rome by pressing them into the mortar. The great majority are 4th century, extending into the 5th century. Most are Christian, but many pagan and a few Jewish, and had probably originally been given as gifts on marriage, or festive occasions such as New Year.  Their iconography has been much studied, although artistically they are relatively unsophisticated.[29]  Their subjects are similar to the catacomb paintings, but with a difference balance including more portraiture of the deceased (usually, it is presumed).  The progression to an increased number of images of saints can be seen in them.[30]  The same technique began to be used for gold tesserae for mosaics in the mid-1st century in Rome, and by the 5th century these had become the standard background for religious mosaics.","input":"Where were the earliest examples of christian art discovered?"},{"output":"an astronomical term referring to the apparent daily motion of stars around Earth, or more precisely around the two celestial poles","context":"Diurnal motion (Latin: diurnus, lit.?'daily', from dies, lit. \\"day\\") is an astronomical term referring to the apparent daily motion of stars around Earth, or more precisely around the two celestial poles. It is caused by the Earth's rotation around its axis, so almost every star appears to move along a circular arc path called the diurnal circle. The time for one complete rotation is 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.09 seconds (1 sidereal day). The first experimental demonstration of this motion was conducted by Lon Foucault.\\r\\nThe relative direction of diurnal motion in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere are as follows:\\r\\nThus, northern circumpolar stars move counterclockwise around Polaris, the north pole star.\\r\\nAt the North Pole, the cardinal directions do not apply to diurnal motion. Within the circumpolar circle, all the stars move simply rightward, or looking directly overhead, counterclockwise around the zenith, where Polaris is.\\r\\nSouthern Celestial Hemisphere observers are to replace north with south, left with right, and Polaris with Sigma Octantis, sometimes called the south pole star. The circumpolar stars move clockwise around Sigma Octantis. East and west are not interchanged.\\r\\nAs seen from the Equator, the two celestial poles are on the horizon due north and south, and the motion is counterclockwise (i.e. leftward) around Polaris and clockwise (i.e. rightward) around Sigma Octantis. All motion is westward, except for the two fixed points.\\r\\nThe daily arc path of an object on the celestial sphere, including the possible part below the horizon, has a length proportional to the cosine of the declination. Thus, the speed of the diurnal motion of a celestial object equals this cosine times 15 per hour, 15 arcminutes per minute, or 15 arcseconds per second.\\r\\nPer a certain period of time, a given angular distance traveled by an object along or near the celestial equator may be compared to the angular diameter of one of the following objects:\\r\\nStar trail and time-lapse photography capture diurnal motion blur. The apparent motion of stars near the celestial pole seems slower than that of stars closer to the celestial equator. Conversely, following the diurnal motion with the camera to eliminate its arcing effect on a long exposure, can best be done with an equatorial mount, which requires adjusting the right ascension only; a telescope may have a sidereal motor drive to do that automatically.","input":"What is the daily motion of the earth?"},{"output":"five-line","context":"A limerick is a form of verse, often humorous and sometimes obscene, in five-line, predominantly anapestic[1] meter with a strict rhyme scheme of AABBA, in which the first, second and fifth line rhyme, while the third and fourth lines are shorter and share a different rhyme.[2] The following example is a limerick of unknown origin:\\r\\nThe limerick packs laughs anatomical\\r\\nInto space that is quite economical.\\r\\nBut the good ones I've seen\\r\\nSo seldom are clean\\r\\nAnd the clean ones so seldom are comical.[3]\\r\\nThe form appeared in England in the early years of the 18th century.[4] It was popularized by Edward Lear in the 19th century,[5] although he did not use the term. Gershon Legman, who compiled the largest and most scholarly anthology, held that the true limerick as a folk form is always obscene, and cites similar opinions by Arnold Bennett and George Bernard Shaw,[6] describing the clean limerick as a \\"periodic fad and object of magazine contests, rarely rising above mediocrity\\". From a folkloric point of view, the form is essentially transgressive; violation of taboo is part of its function. Lear is unusual in his creative use of the form, satirising without overt violation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe standard form of a limerick is a stanza of five lines, with the first, second and fifth rhyming with one another and having three feet of three syllables each; and the shorter third and fourth lines also rhyming with each other, but having only two feet of three syllables. The defining \\"foot\\" of a limerick's meter is usually the anapaest, (ta-ta-TUM), but catalexis (missing a weak syllable at the beginning of a line) and extra-syllable rhyme (which adds an extra unstressed syllable) can make limericks appear amphibrachic (ta-TUM-ta).\\r\\nThe first line traditionally introduces a person and a place, with the place appearing at the end of the first line and establishing the rhyme scheme for the second and fifth lines. In early limericks, the last line was often essentially a repeat of the first line, although this is no longer customary.\\r\\nWithin the genre, ordinary speech stress is often distorted in the first line, and may be regarded as a feature of the form: \\"There was a young man from the coast;\\" \\"There once was a girl from Detroit\\" Legman takes this as a convention whereby prosody is violated simultaneously with propriety.[7] Exploitation of geographical names, especially exotic ones, is also common, and has been seen as invoking memories of geography lessons in order to subvert the decorum taught in the schoolroom; Legman finds that the exchange of limericks is almost exclusive to comparatively well-educated males, women figuring in limericks almost exclusively as \\"villains or victims\\". The most prized limericks incorporate a kind of twist, which may be revealed in the final line or lie in the way the rhymes are often intentionally tortured, or both. Many limericks show some form of internal rhyme, alliteration or assonance, or some element of word play. Verses in limerick form are sometimes combined with a refrain to form a limerick song, a traditional humorous drinking song often with obscene verses.\\r\\nDavid Abercrombie, a phonetician, takes a different view of the limerick, and one which seems to accord better with the form.[8] It is this: Lines one, two, and five have three feet, that is to say three stressed syllables, while lines three and four have two stressed syllables. The number and placement of the unstressed syllables is rather flexible. There is at least one unstressed syllable between the stresses but there may be more ÿ as long as there are not so many as to make it impossible to keep the equal spacing of the stresses.\\r\\nThe origin of the name limerick for this type of poem is debated. The name is generally taken to be a reference to the City or County of Limerick in Ireland[9][10] sometimes particularly to the Maigue Poets, and may derive from an earlier form of nonsense verse parlour game that traditionally included a refrain that included \\"Will [or won't] you come (up) to Limerick?\\"[11]\\r\\nUntil recently,[when?] the first known usage in England was from 1898 (New English Dictionary) and in the United States from 1902, but in recent years several earlier examples have been documented, the earliest being an 1880 reference, in a Saint John, New Brunswick newspaper, to an apparently well-known tune,[12]\\r\\nThere was a young rustic named Mallory,\\r\\nwho drew but a very small salary.\\r\\nWhen he went to the show,\\r\\nhis purse made him go\\r\\nto a seat in the uppermost gallery.\\r\\nTune: Won't you come to Limerick.[13]\\r\\nThe limerick form was popularized by Edward Lear in his first Book of Nonsense (1846) and a later work, More Nonsense, Pictures, Rhymes, Botany, etc. (1872). Lear wrote 212 limericks, mostly considered nonsense literature. It was customary at the time for limericks to accompany an absurd illustration of the same subject, and for the final line of the limerick to be a variant of the first line ending in the same word, but with slight differences that create a nonsensical, circular effect. The humour is not in the \\"punch line\\" ending but rather in the tension between meaning and its lack.[14]\\r\\nThe following is an example of one of Edward Lear's limericks.\\r\\nThere was a Young Person of Smyrna\\r\\nWhose grandmother threatened to burn her.\\r\\nBut she seized on the cat,\\r\\nand said 'Granny, burn that!\\r\\nYou incongruous old woman of Smyrna!'\\r\\nLear's limericks were often typeset in three or four lines, according to the space available under the accompanying picture.\\r\\nThe limerick form is so well known that it has been parodied in many ways. The following example is of unknown origin:\\r\\nThere was a young man from Japan\\r\\nWhose limericks never would scan.\\r\\nAnd when they asked why,\\r\\nHe said \\"I do try!\\r\\nBut when I get to the last line I try to fit in as many words as I can.\\"\\r\\nOther parodies deliberately break the rhyme scheme, like the following example, attributed to W.S. Gilbert:\\r\\nThere was an old man of St. Bees,\\r\\nWho was stung in the arm by a wasp,\\r\\nWhen asked, \\"Does it hurt?\\"\\r\\nHe replied, \\"No, it doesn't,\\r\\nI'm so glad it wasn't a hornet.\\"[15][16]\\r\\nComedian John Clarke has also parodied Lear's style:\\r\\nThere was an old man with a beard,\\r\\nA funny old man with a beard\\r\\nHe had a big beard\\r\\nA great big old beard\\r\\nThat amusing old man with a beard.[17]\\r\\nThe British wordplay and recreational mathematics expert Leigh Mercer (1893ÿ1977) devised the following mathematical limerick:\\r\\nThis is read as follows:\\r\\nA dozen, a gross, and a score\\r\\nPlus three times the square root of four\\r\\nDivided by seven\\r\\nPlus five times eleven\\r\\nIs nine squared and not a bit more.[18]\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nBibliography\\r\\nLimerick bibliographies:","input":"How long does a limerick have to be?"},{"output":"3 December 1967","context":"Christiaan Neethling Barnard (8 November 1922?ÿ 2 September 2001) was a South African cardiac surgeon who performed the world's first human-to-human heart transplant on 3 December 1967 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa.[1][2] Growing up in Beaufort West, Cape Province, he studied medicine and practised for several years in his native country.[3] As a young doctor experimenting on dogs, Barnard developed a remedy for the infant defect of intestinal atresia. His technique saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town and was adopted by surgeons in Britain and the United States.[4] In 1955, he travelled to the United States and was initially assigned further gastrointestinal work by Owen Wangensteen.[5] He was introduced to the heart-lung machine, and Barnard was allowed to transfer to the service run by open heart surgery pioneer Walt Lillehei.[6] Upon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at the Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town.[7]\\r\\nOn 3 December 1967, Barnard transplanted the heart of Denise Darvall, who had just died from a head injury, into the chest of a 54-year-old Louis Washkansky. Washkansky regained full consciousness and lived for eighteen days, even spending time with his wife, before he died of pneumonia, with the suppression of his immune system by the anti-rejection drugs being a major contributing factor.[3][8] Barnard had told Mr. and Mrs. Washkansky that the operation had an 80% chance of success, a claim which has been criticised as misleading.[9][10][11]\\r\\nBarnard's second transplant patient Philip Blaiberg, with the operation performed at the beginning of 1968, lived for nineteen months and was able to go home from the hospital.[3][12]\\r\\nHe retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing rheumatoid arthritis in his hands which ended his surgical career. He became interested in anti-aging research, and in 1986 his reputation suffered when he promoted Glycel, an expensive \\"anti-aging\\" skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States Food and Drug Administration soon thereafter. During his remaining years, he established the Christiaan Barnard Foundation, dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world. He died in 2001 at the age of 78 after an asthma attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBarnard grew up in Beaufort West, Cape Province, Union of South Africa. His father, Adam Barnard, was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church.[2] One of his four brothers, Abraham, was a \\"blue baby\\" who died of a heart problem at the age of three (Barnard would later guess that it was tetralogy of Fallot). The family also experienced the loss of a daughter who was stillborn and who had been the fraternal twin of Barnard's older brother Johannes, who was twelve years older than Chris.[13] Barnard matriculated from the Beaufort West High School in 1940, and went to study medicine at the University of Cape Town Medical School, where he obtained his MB ChB in 1945.\\r\\nHis father served as a missionary to mixed-race peoples. His mother, the former Maria Elisabeth de Swart, instilled in the surviving brothers the belief that they could do anything they set their minds to.[3]\\r\\nBarnard did his internship and residency at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, after which he worked as a general practitioner in Ceres, a rural town in the Cape Province.[2] In 1951, he returned to Cape Town where he worked at the City Hospital as a Senior Resident Medical Officer, and in the Department of Medicine at the Groote Schuur Hospital as a registrar.[2] He completed his master's degree, receiving Master of Medicine in 1953 from the University of Cape Town. In the same year he obtained a doctorate in medicine (MD) from the same university for a dissertation titled \\"The treatment of tuberculous meningitis\\".\\r\\nSoon after qualifying as a doctor, Barnard performed experiments on dogs investigating intestinal atresia, a birth defect which allows life-threatening gaps to develop in the intestines. He followed a medical hunch that this was caused by inadequate blood flow to the fetus. After nine months and forty-three attempts, Barnard was able to reproduce this condition in a fetus puppy by tying off some of the blood supply to a puppy's intestines and then placing the animal back in the womb, after which it was born some two weeks later, with the condition of intestinal atresia. He was also able to cure the condition by removing the piece of intestine with inadequate blood supply. The mistake of previous surgeons had been attempting to reconnect ends of intestine which themselves still had inadequate blood supply. To be successful, it was typically necessary to remove between 15 and 20 centimeters of intestine (6 to 8 inches). Jannie Louw used this innovation in a clinical setting, and Barnard's method saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town. This technique was also adapted by surgeons in Britain and the US. In addition, Barnard analyzed 259 cases of tubercular meningitis.[4]\\r\\nOwen Wangensteen in Minnesota had been impressed by the work of Alan Thal, a young South African doctor working in Minnesota. He asked Groote Schuur Head of Medicine John Brock if he might recommend any similarly talented South Africans and Brock recommended Barnard.[14] In December 1955, Barnard travelled to the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States, to begin a two-year scholarship under Chief of Surgery Wangensteen, who assigned Barnard more work on the intestines, which Barnard accepted even though he wanted to move onto something new.[5] Simply by luck, whenever Barnard needed a break from this work, he could wander across the hall and talk with Vince Gott who ran the lab for open-heart surgery pioneer Walt Lillehei. Gott had begun to develop a technique of running blood backwards through the veins of the heart so Lillehei could more easily operate on the aortic valve (McRae writes, \\"It was the type of inspired thinking that entranced Barnard\\"). In March 1956, Gott asked Barnard to help him run the heart-lung machine for an operation.[6] Shortly thereafter, Wangensteen agreed to let Barnard switch to Lillehei's service. It was during this time that Barnard first became acquainted with fellow future heart transplantation surgeon Norman Shumway.[15] Barnard also became friendly with Gil Campbell who had demonstrated that a dog's lung could be used to oxygenate blood during open-heart surgery. (The year before Barnard arrived, Lillehei and Campbell had used this procedure for twenty minutes during surgery on a 13-year-old boy with ventricular septal defect, and the boy had made a full recovery.) Barnard and Campbell met regularly for early breakfast.[16] In 1958, Barnard received a Master of Science in Surgery for a thesis titled \\"The aortic valve ÿ problems in the fabrication and testing of a prosthetic valve\\".[2] The same year he was awarded a Ph.D. for his dissertation titled \\"The aetiology of congenital intestinal atresia\\".[2] Barnard described the two years he spent in the United States as \\"the most fascinating time in my life.\\"\\r\\nUpon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at Groote Schuur hospital, as well as holding a joint post at the University of Cape Town.[7][17] He was promoted to full-time lecturer and Director of Surgical Research at the University of Cape Town. In 1960, he flew to Moscow in order to meet Vladimir Demikhov, a top expert on organ transplants[18] (later he credited Demikhov's accomplishment saying that \\"if there is a father of heart and lung transplantation then Demikhov certainly deserves this title.\\")[19] In 1961 he was appointed Head of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the teaching hospitals of the University of Cape Town. He rose to the position of Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1962. Barnard's younger brother Marius, who also studied medicine, eventually became Barnard's right-hand man at the department of Cardiac Surgery.[2] Over time, Barnard became known as a brilliant surgeon with many contributions to the treatment of cardiac diseases, such as the Tetralogy of Fallot and Ebstein's anomaly. He was promoted to Professor of Surgical Science in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1972. In 1981, Barnard became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.[20] Among the many awards he received over the years, he was named Professor Emeritus in 1984.\\r\\nFollowing the first successful kidney transplant in 1953, in the United States, Barnard performed the second kidney transplant in South Africa in October 1967, the first being done in Johannesburg the previous year.[21][page?needed][22]\\r\\nOn 23 January 1964, James Hardy at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi, performed the world's first heart transplant and world's first cardiac xenotransplant by transplanting the heart of a chimpanzee into a desperately ill and dying man. This heart did beat in the patient's chest for approximately 60 to 90 minutes. The patient, Boyd Rush, died without ever regaining consciousness.[23][24][25][26][27][28]\\r\\nBarnard had experimentally transplanted forty-eight hearts into dogs, which was about a fifth the number that Adrian Kantrowitz had performed at Maimonides Medical Center in New York and about a sixth the number Norman Shumway had performed at Stanford University in California. Barnard had no dogs which had survived longer than ten days, unlike Kantrowitz and Shumway who had had dogs survive for more than a year.[29][30] [31]\\r\\nWith the availability of new breakthroughs introduced by several pioneers, also including Richard Lower at the Medical College of Virginia, several surgical teams were in a position to prepare for a human heart transplant.[2][32] Barnard had a patient willing to undergo the procedure, but as with other surgeons, he needed a suitable donor.[2][31]\\r\\nDuring the Apartheid era in South Africa, non-white persons and citizens were not given equal opportunities in the medical professions. At Groote Schuur Hospital, Hamilton Naki was an informally taught surgeon. He started out as a gardener and cleaner. One day he was asked to help out with an experiment on a giraffe. From this modest beginning, Naki became principal lab technician and taught hundreds[33] of surgeons, and assisted with Barnard's organ transplant program. Barnard said, \\"Hamilton Naki had better technical skills than I did. He was a better craftsman than me, especially when it came to stitching, and had very good hands in the theatre\\". A popular myth, propagated principally by a widely discredited documentary film called Hidden Heart[34][35][36][37] and an erroneous newspaper article[33] , maintains incorrectly that Naki was present during the Washkansky transplant.[38][33]\\r\\nBarnard performed the world's first human-to-human heart transplant operation in the early morning hours of Sunday 3 December 1967.[1][3][39] Louis Washkansky, a 54-year-old grocer who was suffering from diabetes and incurable heart disease, was the patient.[8][40] Barnard was assisted by his brother Marius Barnard, as well as a team of thirty persons. The operation lasted approximately five hours.[31][41][42][40]\\r\\nBarnard stated to Washkansky and his wife Ann Washkansky that the transplant had an 80% chance of success.[9][11][43] This has been criticised by the ethicists Peter Singer and Helga Kuhse as making claims for chances of success to the patient and family which were \\"unfounded\\" and \\"misleading\\".[10]\\r\\nBarnard later wrote, \\"For a dying man it is not a difficult decision because he knows he is at the end. If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced you have a chance to swim to the other side.\\" The donor heart came from a young woman, Denise Darvall, who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town.[2] On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear.[44] Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall's father for Denise's heart to be used in the transplant attempt.[45] The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower's technique. Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins.[46] Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard.[2] Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, \\"Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then stood back and said, 'It works.'\\"[2][31]\\r\\nWashkansky survived the operation and lived for 18 days, having succumbed to pneumonia as he was taking immunosuppressive drugs.\\r\\nBarnard was celebrated around the world for his accomplishment. He was photogenic, and enjoyed the media attention following the operation.\\r\\nWorldwide, approximately 100 transplants were performed by various doctors during 1968.[47] Only a third of these patients lived longer than three months. A U.S. National Institutes of Health publication states, \\"Within several years, only Shumway's team at Stanford was attempting transplants.\\"[32]\\r\\nBarnard's second transplant operation was conducted on 2 January 1968, and the patient, Philip Blaiberg, survived for 19 months.[3][12] Dirk van Zyl, who received a new heart in 1971, was the longest-lived recipient, surviving over 23 years.[48]\\r\\nBetween December 1967 and November 1974 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, ten heart transplants were performed, as well as a heart and lung transplant in 1971. Of these ten patients, four lived longer than 18 months, with two of these four becoming long-term survivors. One patient lived for over thirteen years and another for over twenty-four years.[49]\\r\\nFull recovery of donor heart function often takes place over hours or days, during which time considerable damage can occur. Other deaths to patients can occur from preexisting conditions. For example, in pulmonary hypertension the patient's right ventricle has often adapted to the higher pressure over time and, although diseased and hypertrophied, is often capable of maintaining circulation to the lungs. Barnard designed the idea of the heterotopic (or \\"piggy back\\" transplant) in which the patient's diseased heart is left in place while the donor heart is added, essentially forming a \\"double heart\\". Barnard performed the first such heterotopic heart transplant in 1974.[49][50]\\r\\nFrom November 1974 through December 1983, 49 consecutive heterotopic heart transplants on 43 patients were performed at Groote Schuur. The survival rate for patients at one year was over 60%, as compared to less than 40% with standard transplants, and the survival rate at five years was over 36% as compared to less than 20% with standard transplants.[49]\\r\\nMany surgeons gave up cardiac transplantation due to poor results, often due to rejection of the transplanted heart by the patient's immune system. Barnard persisted until the advent of cyclosporine, an effective immunosuppressive drug, which helped revive the operation throughout the world. He also attempted xenotransplantation in a human patient, while attempting to save the life of a girl who was unable to leave artificial life support after her second aortic valve replacement.\\r\\nBarnard was an outspoken opponent of South Africa's laws of apartheid, and was not afraid to criticise his nation's government, although he had to temper his remarks to some extent to travel abroad.[citation needed] Rather than leaving his homeland, he used his fame to campaign for a change in the law. Christiaan's brother, Marius Barnard, went into politics, and was elected to the legislature from Progressive Federal Party. Barnard later stated that the reason he never won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was probably because he was a \\"white South African\\".[51]\\r\\nShortly before his visit to Kenya in 1978, the following was written about his views regarding race relations in South Africa; \\"While he believes in the participation of Africans in the political process of South Africa, he is opposed to a one-man-one-vote system in South Africa\\".[52]\\r\\nIn answering a hypothetical question on how he would solve the race problem were he a \\"benevolent dictator in South Africa\\", Barnard stated the following in a long interview at the Weekly Review:[53]\\r\\nThe interview ended with the following summary from he himself; \\"I often say that, like King Lear, South Africa is a country more sinned against than sinning.\\"[53]\\r\\nBarnard's first marriage was to Aletta Gertruida Louw, a nurse, whom he married in 1948 while practising medicine in Ceres. The couple had two children? Deirdre (born 1950) and Andre (1951ÿ1984).[2][54] International fame took a toll on his personal life, and in 1969, Barnard and his wife divorced. In 1970, he married heiress Barbara Zoellner when she was 19, the same age as his son, and they had two children? Frederick (born 1972) and Christiaan Jr. (born 1974).[55] He divorced Zoellner in 1982.[55] Barnard married for a third time in 1988 to Karin Setzkorn, a young model.[55] They also had two children, Armin (born 1989) and Lara (born 1997), but this last marriage also ended in divorce in 2000.[55]\\r\\nBarnard described in his autobiography The Second Life a one-night extramarital affair with Italian film star Gina Lollobrigida,[2][56] that occurred in January 1968. During that visit to Rome he received an audience from Pope Paul VI.[57]\\r\\nIn October 2016, U.S. Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster (D-NH) stated that Barnard sexually assaulted her when she was 23 years old. According to Kuster, he attempted to grope her under her skirt, while seated at a business luncheon with Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-CA), whom she worked for at the time.[58][59][60]\\r\\nBarnard retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing rheumatoid arthritis in his hands which ended his surgical career. He had struggled with arthritis since 1956, when it was diagnosed during his postgraduate work in the United States.[2] After retirement, he spent two years as the Scientist-In-Residence at the Oklahoma Transplantation Institute in the United States and as an acting consultant for various institutions.[citation needed]\\r\\nHe had by this time become very interested in anti-aging research, and his reputation suffered in 1986 when he promoted Glycel, an expensive \\"anti-aging\\" skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States Food and Drug Administration soon thereafter.[3] He also spent time as a research advisor to the Clinique la Prairie, in Switzerland, where the controversial \\"rejuvenation therapy\\" was practised.[61]\\r\\nBarnard divided the remainder of his years between Austria, where he established the Christiaan Barnard Foundation, dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world, and his game farm in Beaufort West, South Africa.[citation needed]\\r\\nChristiaan Barnard died on 2 September 2001, while on holiday in Paphos, Cyprus. Early reports stated that he had died of a heart attack, but an autopsy showed his death was caused by a severe asthma attack.[62]\\r\\nChristiaan Barnard wrote two autobiographies. His first book, One Life, was published in 1969 (ISBN?0245599525) and sold copies worldwide. Some of the proceeds were used to set up the Chris Barnard Fund for research into heart disease and heart transplants in Cape Town.[63] His second autobiography, The Second Life, was published in 1993, eight years before his death (ISBN?0947461388).\\r\\nApart from his autobiographies, Dr Barnard also wrote several other books including:[64]","input":"When did the first human heart transplant happen?"},{"output":"once roughly every month","context":"The full moon is the lunar phase when the Moon appears fully illuminated from Earth's perspective. This occurs when Earth is located directly between the Sun and the Moon (more exactly, when the ecliptic longitudes of the Sun and Moon differ by 180). This means that the lunar hemisphere facing Earth ÿ the near side ÿ is completely sunlit and appears as a circular disk, while the far side is dark. The full moon occurs once roughly every month.\\r\\nWhen the Moon moves into Earth's shadow, a lunar eclipse occurs, during which all or part of the Moon's face may appear reddish due to the Rayleigh scattering of blue wavelengths and the refraction of sunlight through Earth's atmosphere.[3][4][5] Lunar eclipses happen only during full moon and around points on its orbit where the satellite may pass through the planet's shadow. A lunar eclipse does not occur every month because the Moon's orbit is inclined 5.14 with respect to the ecliptic plane of earth; thus, the Moon usually passes north or south of Earth's shadow, which is mostly restricted to this plane of reference. Lunar eclipses happen only when the full moon occurs around either node of its orbit (ascending or descending). Therefore, a lunar eclipse occurs approximately every 6 months and often 2 weeks before or after a solar eclipse, which occurs during new moon around the opposite node.\\r\\nThe interval period between a new or full moon and the next same phase, a synodic month, averages about 29.53 days. Therefore, in those lunar calendars in which each month begins on the day of the new moon, the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th day of the lunar month. Because a calendar month consists of a whole number of days, a lunar month may be either 29 or 30 days long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA full moon is often thought of as an event of a full night's duration. This is somewhat misleading because its phase seen from Earth continuously waxes or wanes (though much too slowly to notice in real time with the naked eye). Its maximum illumination occurs at the moment waxing has stopped. For any given location, about half of these maximum full moons may be visible, while the other half occurs during the day, when the full moon is below the horizon.\\r\\nMany almanacs list full moons not only by date, but also by their exact time, usually in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Typical monthly calendars that include lunar phases may be offset by one day when used in a different time zone.\\r\\nFull moon is generally a suboptimal time to conduct astronomical observations because the bright sunlight reflected by the Moon then outshines the apparently dimmer stars.\\r\\nOn 12 December 2008, the full moon occurred closer to the Earth than it had been at any time for the previous 15 years, called a supermoon.[6]\\r\\nOn 19 March 2011, another full supermoon occurred, closer to the Earth than at any time for the previous 18 years.[7]\\r\\nOn 14 November 2016, a full supermoon occurred closer to the Earth than at any time for the previous 68 years.[8]\\r\\nThe date and approximate time of a specific full moon (assuming a circular orbit) can be calculated from the following equation:[9]\\r\\nwhere d is the number of days since 1 January 2000 00:00:00 in the Terrestrial Time scale used in astronomical ephemerides; for Universal Time (UT) add the following approximate correction to d:\\r\\nwhere N is the number of full moons since the first full moon of 2000. The true time of a full moon may differ from this approximation by up to about 14.5 hours as a result of the non-circularity of the moon's orbit.[10] See New moon for an explanation of the formula and its parameters.\\r\\nThe age and apparent size of the full moon vary in a cycle of just under 14 synodic months, which has been referred to as a full moon cycle.\\r\\nFull moons are traditionally associated with temporal insomnia (inability to sleep), insanity (hence the terms lunacy and lunatic) and various \\"magical phenomena\\" such as lycanthropy. Psychologists, however, have found that there is no strong evidence for effects on human behavior around the time of a full moon.[11] They find that studies are generally not consistent, with some showing a positive effect and others showing a negative effect. In one instance, the 23 December 2000 issue of the British Medical Journal published two studies on dog bite admission to hospitals in England and Australia. The study of the Bradford Royal Infirmary found that dog bites were twice as common during a full moon, whereas the study conducted by the public hospitals in Australia found that they were less likely. All this is relevant to canine rather than human behavior.\\r\\nHistorically, month names are names of moons (lunations, not necessarily full moons) in lunisolar calendars. Since the introduction of the solar Julian calendar in the Roman Empire, and later the Gregorian calendar worldwide, people no longer perceive month names as \\"moon\\" names. The traditional Old English month names were equated with the names of the Julian calendar from an early time (soon after Christianization, according to the testimony of Bede ca. AD 700).\\r\\nSome full moons have developed new names in modern times, e.g., the blue moon, and the names \\"harvest moon\\" and \\"hunter's moon\\" for the full moons of autumn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"harvest moon\\" and \\"hunter's moon\\" are traditional terms for the full moons occurring during late summer and in the autumn, in the northern hemisphere usually in September and October respectively. The \\"harvest moon\\" is the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox (22 or 23 September), coming anywhere from two weeks before to two weeks after that date.[13] The \\"hunter's moon\\" is the full moon following it. The names are recorded from the early 18th century.[14] The Oxford English Dictionary entry for \\"harvest moon\\" cites a 1706 reference, and for \\"hunter's moon\\" a 1710 edition of The British Apollo, where the term is attributed to \\"the country people\\" (The Country People call this the Hunters-Moon.). The names became traditional in American folklore, where they are now often popularly attributed to the Native Americans.[15] The Feast of the Hunters' Moon is a yearly festival in West Lafayette, Indiana, held in late September or early October each year since 1968.[16] In 2010, the Harvest moon occurred on the night of equinox itself (some 5?1?2 hours after the point of equinox) for the first time since 1991.[17][18]\\r\\nAll full moons rise around the time of sunset. Because the moon moves eastward among the stars faster than the sun its meridian passage is delayed, causing it to rise later each day ÿ on average by about 50.47 minutes.[19] The harvest moon and hunter's moon are unique because the time difference between moonrises on successive evenings is much shorter than average. The moon rises approximately 30 minutes later from one night to the next, as seen from about 40 degrees N or S latitude. (This is because a full moon in September appears to move not straight east but north-east in the sky.) Thus, there is no long period of darkness between sunset and moonrise for several days after the full moon,[20] thus lengthening the time in the evening when there is enough light for men to see to work to get the harvest in.\\r\\nThe Maine Farmers' Almanac from c. the 1930s began to publish Native American \\"Indian\\" full moon names. The Farmers' Almanac (since 1955 published in Maine, but not the same publication as the Maine Farmers' Almanac) continues to do so.[21]\\r\\nAn early list of \\"Indian month names\\" was published in 1918 by Daniel Carter Beard in his The American Boy's Book of Signs, Signals and Symbols for use by the boy scouts. Beard's \\"Indian\\" month names were:[22]\\r\\nSuch names have gained currency in American folklore. They appear in print more widely outside of the almanac tradition from the 1990s in popular publications about the Moon. Mysteries of the Moon by Patricia Haddock (\\"Great Mysteries Series\\", Greenhaven Press, 1992) gave an extensive list of such names along with the individual tribal groups they were supposedly associated with.[23] Haddock supposes that certain \\"Colonial American\\" moon names were adopted from Algonquian languages (which were formerly spoken in the territory of New England), while others are based in European tradition (e.g., the Colonial American names for the May moon, \\"Milk Moon\\", \\"Mother's Moon\\", \\"Hare Moon\\" have no parallels in the supposed native names, while the name of November, \\"Beaver Moon\\" is supposedly based in the Algonquin).\\r\\nThe individual names given in Farmers' Almanac include:[clarification needed]\\r\\nThe Long Night's Moon is the last of the year and the closest to the winter solstice.[25]\\r\\n\\"Ice moon\\" is also used to refer to the first full moon of January or February.[26]\\r\\nIn Hinduism, most festivals are celebrated on auspicious days. Many of the Hindu festivals are celebrated on days with a full moon at night. Different parts of India celebrate the same day with different names, as listed below:\\r\\nMost pre-modern calendars the world over were lunisolar, combining the solar year with the lunation by means of intercalary months.[32][33] The Julian calendar abandoned this method in favour of a purely solar reckoning while conversely the 7th-century Islamic calendar opted for a purely lunar one.\\r\\nA continuing lunisolar calendar is in the Hebrew calendar. Evidence of this is noted in the dates of Passover and Easter in Judaism and Christianity, respectively. The date of the Jewish Rosh Hashana and Sukkot festivals along with all other Jewish holidays are dependent on the dates of the new moons.[34]\\r\\nIn lunisolar calendars, an intercalary month occurs seven times in the 19 years of the Metonic cycle, or on average every 2.7 years (19/7). In the Hebrew Calendar this is noted with a periodic extra month of Adar in the early spring.\\r\\nIn the modern system of \\"traditional\\" full moon names tied to the solstice and equinox points, a supernumerary full moon in such a period is called a blue moon. The term \\"blue moon\\" used in this sense may date to as early as the 16th century, but it became well known in the United States due to the Farmers' Almanac (published since 1818).[35]\\r\\nAccording to the Farmers' Almanac, a \\"blue moon\\" is the third full moon in any period between either solstice and equinox, or between equinox and solstice, (calculated using the mean tropical year), which contains four full moons.[36] These seasons are equal in length, unlike the astronomical ones, which vary in length depending on the Earth's speed in its elliptical orbit round the sun. To compare, in 1983 the equal length seasons began at 1.48 AM on 23 March, 9.15 AM on 22 June, 4.42 PM on 21 September and 12.10 AM on 22 December, while the astronomical seasons began at 4.39 AM on 21 March, 11.09 PM on 21 June, 2.42 PM on 23 September and 10.30 AM on 22 December (all times GMT). Due to a misinterpretation of this definition in the March 1946 Sky & Telescope magazine, \\"blue moon\\" has also been used in the sense of \\"the second full moon in any month which contains two full moons (this usage has been noted as \\"erroneous\\" by Sky & Telescope in 1999).[37] According to either definition, \\"blue moons\\" occur with the average frequency of intercalary months, seven times in 19 years, the Farmers' Almanac system of \\"full moon names\\" effectively defining a lunisolar calendar.","input":"About how often is a full moon observed from earths surface?"},{"output":"31,419 points","context":"This article concerns the career achievements of Basketball Hall-of-Famer Wilt Chamberlain, who holds numerous NBA records in scoring, rebounding and durability.

Denied another Dragon by the Council of Elder Riders, Galbatorix blamed the Council for the death of his dragon and sought to destroy the order. He made an alliance with an ambitious young rider, Morzan, and with his help slew another rider and took his next dragon captive, Shruikan. Using magic, he broke Shruikan's will and forced the dragon to serve him. Gathering more Riders to his cause, he created the Thirteen Forsworn and with their help took over Ilirea, the capital of the Broddring Kingdom, and destroyed Vroengard, the center of the Dragon Riders. Galbatorix slew the Elders, their leader Vrael and took his sword, and most of the Dragon Riders. When the remaining dragons found out that the betrayal was aided by their own species, they collectively cast a spell on the Forsworn's dragons, which prevents them from being named.\\r\\nElder Rider Oromis and his Dragon Glaedr fled to Ellesmera, the capital of the elves' kingdom, while Morzan confronted his old friend Brom, slaying his Dragon. However, Morzan showed mercy to Brom, who later escaped. After the fall of the Riders, Galbatorix declared himself King over all of Alagaesia. He then focused his efforts onto going after the elves and the dwarfs but he was thwarted.\\r\\nOver the next century, several of the Forsworn were killed either from battle or power struggles, or committed suicide after going mad. Surda declared independence from Galbatorix and became its own country. Brom created the Varden, a rebellion meant to oppose the Empire, killing three of the Forsworn including Morzan personally; and orchestrated the deaths of five more. Brom and Morzan's wife, Selena, fell in love while Brom was working undercover in Morzan's staff (though this is revealed in the third book). Selena, who already had borne Morzan's son, became pregnant with Brom's child. She returned to Carvahall, her brother Garrow's home, to give birth to the child. After begging her brother and his wife to raise her son, Eragon, as their own, she left Carvahall to return to Morzan and her first son. She died soon afterward. When Brom needed to disappear, he travelled to Carvahall, disguised as a storyteller to be near his son who is not aware of his relationship to the man.\\r\\nThe first book in the series started with the attack on Arya (an elf) who was carrying a dragon's egg, by Durza(a shade), a servant of Galbatorix. Only two other Dragon eggs remain in the citadel in Ilirea, which had been renamed Ur?'baen by Galbatorix. Arya attempted to send the egg to Brom, but the remaining Eldunar altered the spell making the egg go to Eragon, because they believed that the egg might hatch for him (revealed in the final book), who finds the egg while on a hunting trip. A few days later, the egg hatches and Eragon touches it, giving him a silver mark on his palm and making Eragon a Dragon Rider through their bond. The hatchling chooses the name Saphira from a list of dragon names Eragon reads to her. Eragon's cousin, Roran, leaves for a job to earn money so he can start a family with his beloved, Katrina. His uncle, Garrow, is killed by King Galbatorix's servants, the Ra'zac, and Eragon flees Carvahall with Brom to hunt down the Ra'zac, unaware that Brom is his father. Brom gives Morzan's sword, Zar'roc, to Eragon.\\r\\nOn the journey, Brom teaches Eragon sword fighting, magic, a minimal understanding of the Ancient Language, and the ways of the Dragon Riders. On the journey they become close friends. Halfway through their journey, their camp is ambushed by the Ra'zac and a stranger named Murtagh rescues them, but Brom is gravely injured. In his dying breath, Brom reveals to Eragon that he once was a Dragon Rider and his Dragon was also named Saphira.\\r\\nEragon decides to follow his dream of Arya to Gil'ead. Murtagh and Eragon rescue the courier Arya who reveals she is an elf and is in need of the Varden's medical assistance. They flee to the Varden as they are being chased by Urgals to the capital Tronjheim. As they are trapped, Murtagh is revealed to be Morzan's son. The Varden imprisons Murtagh after he refuses to allow his mind to be read, as Murtagh doesn't want them to learn of his parentage. Eragon is introduced to the Varden's leader, Ajihad, his daughter Nasuada, the dwarf King Hrothgar, and his foster son Orik. The Varden are attacked by an army of Urgals. In the ensuing battle, Eragon gets separated from the main fighting and finds himself in a one-on-one duel with Durza. In the duel, Eragon receives a large cursed scar on his back, but Arya and Saphira create a distraction long enough for Eragon to stab Durza through the heart. In the aftermath, Ajihad is killed by a band of Urgals, and Murtagh is captured.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Roran is wanted by the Empire. His supporters help him fortify and defend Carvahall. He later evacuates to Surda along with most of the villagers.\\r\\nIn the remainder of the Rider War, Eragon and Saphira are tutored by Oromis and Glaedr in Ellesmera. During an elvish Blood-Oath Celebration, Eragon is changed by a symbolic dragon, giving him elf-like abilities (speed, strength) and completely healing his back as well as all of his other injuries. Eragon then reveals his true feelings to Arya. After much persistence, Arya angrily rejects Eragon's suit. Meanwhile, Nasuada moves the Varden to the separate country of Surda which is ruled by King Orrin, and Roran moves the villagers of Carvahall to Surda, after their village was destroyed by the Ra'zac, who also captured Katrina. Roran is promoted to Captain while Nasuada allows the Urgals to join the ranks of the Varden, even though her decision is opposed by many. Eragon and Saphira confront Murtagh and Thorn, who slew King Hrothgar.Thorn hatched for Murtagh and was magically made almost as big as Saphira. Murtagh bests Eragon, taking his sword Zar'roc, and revealing to him that they are brothers.\\r\\nEragon, Saphira, and Roran arrive at Helgrind, where they free Katrina. Eragon and Roran destroy much of Helgrind, slaying the Raz'ac while Saphira kills the Lethrblaka, the Raz'ac's adult form. He then goes to the Beor mountains and helps Orik become king of the dwarves. After that, Eragon goes back to Du Weldenvarden (the homeland of the elves)and creates his own sword Brisingr, which bursts into flames each time Eragon speaks its name, and learns from Oromis and Glaedr that Brom is his real father (Eragon and Murtagh are actually only half brothers) and of the Eldunar, the dragons' hearts of hearts, which are also the source of Galbatorix's power.\\r\\nThe Varden capture several cities of the Empire, and Oromis and Glaedr are killed by Murtagh and Thorn, though Glaedr has given his Eldunar to Eragon and Saphira to further their training. After the defeat of one of the Empire's cities, Nasuada is captured for interrogation by Murtagh, who heals her of her injuries, which causes an identity switch, breaking his oath to Galbatorix. Eragon travels to the Vault of Souls on the ruined Vroengard, which has a massive amount of secret Eldunar and Dragon eggs hidden from Galbatorix. Taking many of the Eldunar, he faces Galbatorix and after a fierce battle (after Murtagh and Thorn decide to help them), Galbatorix is slain by Eragon's improvised spell, which he spoke mentally. Meanwhile, Shruikan is killed by Arya.\\r\\nMurtagh and Thorn retreat to somewhere in the north to have some time to themselves. Nasuada, after a heated debate with the leaders of the Varden, becomes the High Queen of Alaga?sia. Arya returns to Du Weldenvarden to help choose a new monarch for the elves after the death of Queen Islanzad in battle, and is chosen herself. She takes with her the rescued green dragon egg, which soon hatches for her. Thus, Arya becomes a Rider with her dragon named Frnen. Near the end of the book, Arya reveals this to Eragon, as well as her True Name, while Saphira decides to test Frnen \\"to see if he has the iron in his bones, and the fire in his belly to match [her]\\". The two dragons become mates shortly thereafter.\\r\\nEragon reworks the magic of the original pact between Riders and dragons to include both Dwarves and Urgals, allowing the dragon eggs to hatch for members of their races. Eragon, coming to the conclusion that there is no safe place to raise the dragons and train new Riders in Alaga?sia, begins planning transport of the Eldunar and the eggs to a region far from Alaga?sia, save for two eggs which are kept in Alaga?sia: one is to be sent to the dwarves, and the other to the Urgals. Those future Riders will travel to Eragon's new home for training, while new eggs will be sent back to Alaga?sia to hatch for new Riders.\\r\\nThe series is set on the mythical continent of Alaga?sia.\\r\\nThe Beor Mountains are a vast and incredibly tall mountain range in the southeast of Alaga?sia. Within this area is the Az Ragni (river) and Beartooth River, as well as multiple dwarf cities. The city of Tronjheim is located inside the hollow mountain Farthen D?r. Northwest of Farthen D?r is Tarnag, the home of Celbedeil, a great dwarven temple.\\r\\nDu Weldenvarden is a dense forest which covers the north of Alaga?sia. The elf cities of Ceris and Ellesmra are located within the forest, as well as the Gaena River and Lake Ardwen.\\r\\n\\"The Empire\\" covers the west of Alaga?sia and is the area under the control of King Galbatorix. The area is populated by humans living in cities and towns such as Aroughs, Belatona, Carvahall, Ceunon, Daret, Dras-Leona, Eastcroft, Feinster, Gil'ead, Kuasta, Narda, Therinsford, Teirm, Ur?'baen, and Yazuac. The Empire is split by an untamed mountain range known as The Spine. The Palancar Valley, a major valley of The Spine, is the location of Eragon's hometown and is thus where the Inheritance Cycle begins. Helgrind is a large black bare rock mountain known as the gates of death, near Dras-Leona. South of The Empire is the country of \\"Surda\\" which seceded from The Empire while Galbatorix was learning to use the Dragon's Heart of Hearts. Surda includes the cities of Aberon, Petr?vya, Dauth, Cithr, Reavstone, and Lithgow.\\r\\nThe Hadarac Desert is a giant desert which covers the middle of Alaga?sia.\\r\\nNorthwest of the mainland lies the island of Vroengard, containing the city of Doru Araeba. This used to be the home of the Riders before they fell. Now, it is inhabited by strange creatures and is almost completely abandoned except for a few strange people that Eragon saw.\\r\\nAlaga?sia is populated by various sentient races, including Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Urgals (Urgals who grow over 8 feet tall are referred to as a Kull.), Dragons, Werecats, Weredogs/Werewolves ( mentioned in Eldest was a Weredog and as a woman with a cloak on ( the hood and rest would cover ears and tail) who turned into a she wolf. They have the ability to turn into any canine and appear as a human with a tail and wolf ears. She may or may not be an elf.), Shades (a human that is possessed by a spirit or spirits that are stronger than the human vessel), and Ra'zac. Alaga?sia was once host to a now extinct race known as the Grey Folk.\\r\\nThere are multiple languages in the world of Alaga?sia - many races have their own, and the language for magic (The Ancient Language) is shared with the Elvish language. Common is chiefly spoken by humans and the Varden. Many races can speak Common, including the dragons (through thought). The Ancient Language is spoken by Elves and spellcasters from any race as it is the language of magic. It is impossible to lie whilst speaking in the Ancient Language, though the Elves have mastered the ability to omit the truth, or at least part of it. Dwarvish is spoken (somewhat obviously) by the Dwarves. The huge, grey skinned Urgals speak their own guttural language, as well as more primitive Common. The Nomadic language is spoken by the various tribes that wander throughout Alaga?sia. The Ra'zac and the Lethrblaka have their own form of communication. It is a series of clicks, hisses and rattles that no others have been able to speak or decipher.\\r\\nEragon's Guide to Alaga?sia is a supplemental book to the Inheritance Cycle, published in November 2009. The book takes the appearance of being written by Eragon after the events of Inheritance, and is directed at a \\"young Dragon Rider\\" (the reader). It is a collection of information about the characters, settings and objects referred to in the Inheritance novels.[8] It is Paolini's fourth book.[9] Fully in color, the book features fifteen pieces of artwork depicting cities and the various races of Alaga?sia.[10] The illustrations were created by Fred Gambino, Larry McDougal, Ian Miller, and David Wyatt.[11] According to the Publishers Weekly Children's Hardcover Frontlist, more than 100,000 copies of the book were sold in 2009.[12]\\r\\nIn an interview, Christopher Paolini stated that he was considering writing more stories set in Alaga?sia. He plans for one of them to be a continuation of the Inheritance Cycle, and the others to be for new story lines (such as a possible prequel centering on Brom).[13]\\r\\nThe books have been criticized for their derivative nature. The two most commonly discussed sources are Star Wars (because of numerous similarities in the plots)[14] and The Lord of the Rings (because of the setting, elf[15][16] and dwarven races,[15] the language[15] and character and place names). Even many positive reviews note that the work pulls strongly from the conventions of fantasy, in characters, maps, dialogue and concepts.[17]\\r\\nThe reviews of Eldest were similar. Paolini was cited as having developed as a writer from Eragon, but also noted were strong use of The Empire Strikes Back as source material, as well as The Two Towers and Dune.[18] USAToday also cited strong echoes of Star Wars in Eragon's plot,[15] while Entertainment Weekly writes that the plot closely resembles that of The Lord of the Rings.[19]\\r\\nOn December 15, 2006, a film adaptation of Eragon was released. The movie, starring Edward Speleers in the title role of Eragon, as well as Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Rachel Weisz, Sienna Guillory, Djimon Hounsou and Robert Carlyle, was produced by 20th Century Fox. Stefen Fangmeier made his directorial debut with Eragon. The screenplay was written by Peter Buchman. Principal photography for the film took place in Hungary and Slovakia. A DVD of the movie was released March 20, 2007. The film received negative reviews due to complaints of amateur writing and of borrowing from Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.[20]","input":"What is the first book in the eragon series?"},{"output":"4th millennium BC","context":"Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. It contrasts with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions. For broader world history, recorded history begins with the accounts of the ancient world around the 4th millennium BC, and coincides with the invention of writing. For some geographic regions or cultures, written history is limited to a relatively recent period in human history because of the limited use of written records. Moreover, human cultures do not always record all of the information relevant to later historians, such as the full impact of natural disasters or the names of individuals; thus, recorded history for particular types of information is limited based on the types of records kept. Because of this, recorded history in different contexts may refer to different periods of time depending on the topic.\\r\\nThe interpretation of recorded history often relies on historical method, or the set of techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write accounts of the past. The question of the nature, and even the possibility, of an effective method for interpreting recorded history is raised in the philosophy of history as a question of epistemology. The study of different historical methods is known as historiography, which focuses on examining how different interpreters of recorded history create different interpretations of historical evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrehistory traditionally refers to the span of time before recorded history, ending with the invention of writing systems.[1] Prehistory refers to the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to implicit exclusion of certain preliterate civilizations, such as those of Sub-Saharan Africa, pre-Columbian America, Australian Aboriginals and New Zealand Mori.[further explanation needed]\\r\\nProtohistory refers to the transition period between prehistory and history, after the advent of literacy in a society but before the writings of the first historians. Protohistory may also refer to the period during which a culture or civilization has not yet developed writing, but other cultures have noted its existence in their own writings.\\r\\nMore complete writing systems were preceded by proto-writing. Early examples are the Jiahu symbols (c. 6600 BCE), Vin?a signs (c. 5300 BCE), early Indus script (c. 3500 BCE) and Nsibidi script (c. before 500 CE). There is disagreement concerning exactly when prehistory becomes history, and when proto-writing became \\"true writing\\"[2] However, invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the Bronze Age in the late Neolithic of the late 4th millennium BCE. The Sumerian archaic cuneiform script and the Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally considered the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400ÿ3200 BCE with earliest coherent texts from about 2600 BCE.\\r\\nThe earliest chronologies date back to the earliest civilizations of Early Dynastic Period Egypt, Mesopotamia & Sumerians [3] which emerged independently of each other from roughly 3500 B.C.[4] Earliest recorded history, which varies greatly in quality and reliability, deals with Pharaohs and their reigns, made by ancient Egyptians.[5] Much of the earliest recorded history was re-discovered relatively recently due to archaeological dig sites findings.[6] A number of different traditions have developed in different parts of the world as to how to interpret these ancient accounts.\\r\\nIn China, the earliest history was recorded in oracle bone script which was deciphered and may date back to around late 2nd millennium B.C..[7] The Zuo Zhuan, attributed to Zuo Qiuming in the 5th century?B.C. , is the earliest written of narrative history in the world and covers the period from 722 to 468?B.C. . The Classic of History is one of the Five Classics of Chinese classic texts and one of the earliest narratives of China. The Spring and Autumn Annals, the official chronicle of the State of Lu covering the period from 722 to 481?B.C. , is among the earliest surviving historical texts to be arranged on annalistic principles in the world. It is traditionally attributed to Confucius (551ÿ479 B.C. ). Zhan Guo Ce was a renowned ancient Chinese historical compilation of sporadic materials on the Warring States period compiled between the 3rd and 1st centuries?B.C. .\\r\\nSima Qian (around 100?B.C. ) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His written work was the Shiji (Records of the Grand Historian), a monumental lifelong achievement in literature. Its scope extends as far back as the 16th century?B.C. , and it includes many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people, and also explores the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras. His work influenced every subsequent author of history in China, including the prestigious Ban family of the Eastern Han Dynasty era.\\r\\nHerodotus of Halicarnassus (484 B.C. ÿ c. 425 B.C. )[8] has generally been acclaimed as the \\"father of history\\" composing his The Histories written from 450s to the 420s B.C. . However, his contemporary Thucydides (c. 460 B.C. ÿ c. 400 B.C.) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the History of the Peloponnesian War. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.[8]\\r\\nSaint Augustine was influential in Christian and Western thought at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and Renaissance periods, history was often studied through a sacred or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel brought philosophy and a more secular approach in historical study.[9]\\r\\nAccording to John Tosh, \\"From the High Middle Ages (c.1000ÿ1300) onwards, the written word survives in greater abundance than any other source for Western history.\\"[10] Western historians developed methods comparable to modern historiographic research in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany, where they began investigating these source materials to write histories of their past. Many of these histories had strong ideological and political ties to their historical narratives. In the 20th century, academic historians began focusing less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or great men, to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art, which traditionally had been the case. French historians associated with the Annales School introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of cultural history.\\r\\nIn Sri Lanka, the oldest historical text is the Mahavamsa. Buddhist monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya maintained chronicles of Sri Lankan history starting from the third century BCE. These annals were combined and compiled into a single document in the 5th century by the Mahanama of Anuradhapura while Dhatusena of Anuradhapura was ruling the Anuradhapura Kingdom. It was written based on prior ancient compilations known as the Atthakatha, which were commentaries written in Sinhala.[11][page?needed] An earlier document known as the Dipavamsa(4th century CE) \\"Island Chronicles\\" is much simpler and contains less information than the Mahavamsa and was probably compiled using the Atthakatha on the Mahavamsa as well.\\r\\nA companion volume, the Culavamsa \\"Lesser Chronicle\\", compiled by Sinhala monks, covers the period from the 4th century to the British takeover of Sri Lanka in 1815. The Culavamsa was compiled by a number of authors of different time periods.\\r\\nThe combined work, sometimes referred to collectively as the Mahavamsa, provides a continuous historical record of over two millennia, and is considered one of the world's longest unbroken historical accounts.[12] It is one of the few documents containing material relating to the Nga and Yakkha peoples, indigenous inhabitants of Lanka prior to the legendary arrival of Prince Vijaya from Singha Pura of Kalinga.\\r\\nIn the preface to his book, the Muqaddimah (1377), the Arab historian and early sociologist, Ibn Khaldun, warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. Ibn Khaldun often criticized \\"idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data.\\" As a result, he introduced a scientific method to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his \\"new science\\".[13] His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication, propaganda and systematic bias in history,[14] and he is thus considered to be the \\"father of historiography\\"[15][16] or the \\"father of the philosophy of history\\".[17]\\r\\nWhile recorded history begins with the invention of writing, over time new ways of recording history have come along with the advancement of technology. History can now be recorded through photography, audio recordings, and video recordings. More recently, Internet archives have been saving copies of webpages, documenting the history of the Internet. Other methods of collecting historical information have also accompanied the change in technologies; for example, since at least the 20th century, attempts have been made to preserve oral history by recording it. Until the 1990s this was done using analogue recording methods such as cassettes and reel-to-reel tapes. With the onset of new technologies, there are now digital recordings, which may be recorded to CDs.[18] Nevertheless, historical record and interpretation often relies heavily on written records, partially because it dominates the extant historical materials, and partially because historians are used to communicating and researching in that medium.[19]\\r\\nThe historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history. Primary sources are first-hand evidence of history (usually written, but sometimes captured in other mediums) made at the time of an event by a present person. Historians think of those sources as the closest to the origin of the information or idea under study.[20][21] These types of sources can provide researchers with, as Dalton and Charnigo put it, \\"direct, un-mediated information about the object of study.\\"[22]\\r\\nHistorians use other types of sources to understand history as well. Secondary sources are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources. These are sources which, usually, are accounts, works, or research that analyse, assimilate, evaluate, interpret, and/or synthesize primary sources. Tertiary sources are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources and often tell a more generalized account built on the more specific research found in the first two types of sources.[20][23][24]","input":"What is the first written record of mankind?"},{"output":"Brooklyn","context":"New York City's demographics show that it is a large and ethnically diverse metropolis.[2] It is the largest city in the United States with a long history of international immigration. New York City was home to nearly 8.5 million people in 2014,[3] accounting for over 40% of the population of New York State and a slightly lower percentage of the New York metropolitan area, home to approximately 23.6 million. Over the last decade the city has been growing faster than the region. The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States.[4][5][6][7]\\r\\nThroughout its history, New York City has been a major point of entry for immigrants; the term \\"melting pot\\" was coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[8][9][10] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.[9][11][12] English remains the most widely spoken language, although there are areas in the outer boroughs in which up to 25% of people speak English as an alternate language, and/or have limited or no English language fluency. English is least spoken in neighborhoods such as Flushing, Sunset Park, and Corona.\\r\\nNew York City is the most populous city in the United States, with an estimated 8,491,079 people living in the city, according to U.S. Census estimates dating July 1, 2014[16] (up from 8,175,133 in 2010; 8.0 million in 2000; and 7.3 million in 1990).[15] This amounts to about 40% of New York State's population and a similar percentage of the metropolitan regional population. New York's two key demographic features are its population density and cultural diversity. The city's population density of 26,403 people per square mile (10,194/km2), makes it the densest of any American municipality with a population above 100,000.[17] Manhattan's population density is 66,940 people per square mile (25,846/km2), highest of any county in the United States.[18][19]\\r\\nNew York City is multicultural. About 36% of the city's population is foreign-born,[20] one of the highest among US cities. The eleven nations constituting the largest sources of modern immigration to New York City are the Dominican Republic, China, Jamaica, Guyana, Mexico, Ecuador, Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia, Russia and El Salvador.[21]\\r\\nThe New York City metropolitan area is home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel.[22] It is also home to nearly a quarter of the nation's Indian Americans and 15% of all Korean Americans[23][24] and the largest Asian Indian population in the Western Hemisphere; the largest African American community of any city in the country; and including 6 Chinatowns in the city proper,[25] comprised as of 2008 a population of 659,596 overseas Chinese,[26] the largest outside of Asia. New York City alone, according to the 2010 Census, has now become home to more than one million Asian Americans, greater than the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles.[27] New York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper.[28] 6.0% of New York City is of Chinese ethnicity, with about forty percent of them living in the borough of Queens alone. Koreans make up 1.2% of the city's population, and Japanese at 0.3%. Filipinos are the largest southeast Asian ethnic group at 0.8%, followed by Vietnamese who make up only 0.2% of New York City's population. Indians are the largest South Asian group, comprising 2.4% of the city's population, and Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.[29]\\r\\nThe largest ethnic groups as of the 2005 census estimates are: African American, African or Caribbean, Puerto Ricans, Italians, West Indians, Dominicans, Chinese, Irish, Russian, and German.[30][31] The Puerto Rican population of New York City is the largest outside Puerto Rico.[32] The New York City metropolitan area is also home to the largest Italian population in North America and the third largest Italian population outside of Italy. Italians emigrated to the city in large numbers in the early 20th century, establishing several \\"Little Italies\\". The Irish also have a notable presence, along with Germans.\\r\\nNew York City has a high degree of income variation. In 2005 the median household income in the highest census tract was reported to be $188,697, while in the lowest it was $9,320.[33] The variance is driven by wage growth in high income brackets, while wages have stagnated for middle and lower income brackets. In 2006 the average weekly wage in Manhattan was $1,453, the highest and fastest growing among the largest counties in the United States.[34] The borough is also experiencing a \\"baby boom\\" among the wealthy that is unique among U.S. cities. Since 2000, the number of children under age 5 living in Manhattan has grown by more than 32%.[35]\\r\\nIn 2000, about 3 out of every 10 New York City housing units were owner-occupied, compared to about 2 owner-occupied units out of every 3 units in the U.S. as a whole.[36] Rental vacancy is usually between 3% and 4.5%, well below the 5% threshold defined to be a housing emergency, justifying the continuation of rent control and rent stabilization. About 33% of rental units fall under rent stabilization, according to which increases are adjudicated periodically by city agencies. Rent control covers only a very small number of rental units.[37] Some critics point to New York City's strict zoning and other regulations as partial causes for the housing shortage, but during the city's decline in population from the 1960s through the 1980s, a large number of apartment buildings suffered suspected arson fires or were abandoned by their owners. Once the population trend was reversed, with rising prospects for rentals and sales, new construction has resumed, but generally for purchasers in higher income brackets.\\r\\nNew York is the largest city in the United States, with the city proper's population more than double the next largest city, Los Angeles (or roughly equivalent to the combined populations of Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston, the United States' second, third, and fourth most populous cities respectively). Demographers estimate New York's population will reach between 9.4 and 9.7 million by 2030.[38] In 2000 the reported life expectancy of New Yorkers was above the national average. Life expectancy for females born in 2009 in New York City is 80.2 years and for males is 74.5 years.[39]\\r\\nNew York's two key demographic features are its density and diversity. The city has an extremely high population density of 26,403 people per square mile (10,194/km2), about 10,000 more people per square mile than the next densest large American city, San Francisco.[41] Manhattan's population density is 66,940 people per square mile (25,846/km2).[19]\\r\\nThe city has a long tradition of attracting international immigration and Americans seeking careers in certain sectors. As of 2006, New York City has ranked number one for seven consecutive years as the city most U.S. residents would most like to live in or near.[42]\\r\\nThroughout its history New York City has been a principal entry point for immigration to the United States. These immigrants often form ethnic enclaves, neighborhoods dominated by one ethnicity. The city experienced major immigration from Europe in the 19th century and another major wave in the early 20th century, being admitted into the United States of America primarily through Ellis Island. Since the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, and particularly since the 1980s, New York City has seen renewed rates of high immigration. Newer immigrants are from Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. 36% of the city's population is foreign-born.[20] Among U.S. cities, this proportion is higher only in Los Angeles and Miami.[19] In New York no single country or region of origin dominates. The eleven largest countries of origin are the Dominican Republic, China, Jamaica, Guyana, Mexico, Ecuador, Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia, Russia and El Salvador.[43] Between 1990 and 2000 the city admitted 1,224,524 immigrants.[44] Demographers and city officials have observed that immigration to New York City has been slowing since 1997. This is mostly due to more and more immigrants choosing directly to locate to the city's suburbs and then commute to the city or work in many of its booming edge cities like Fort Lee, NJ, Hempstead, NY, Morristown, NJ, Stamford, CT, White Plains, NY and others. Despite the slowdown in immigration the city's overall immigrant population has continued to increase and in 2006 it numbered 3.038 million (37.0%) up from 2.871 million (35.9%) in 2000.[45][46] By 2013, the population of foreign-born individuals living in New York City had increased to 3.07 million, and as a percentage of total population, was the highest it had been in the past 100 years.[47]\\r\\nImmigrant Africans, Caribbeans, and African Americans make up 25.1% of New York City's population. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 2,086,566 black people residing in New York City. Percentage wise, approximately two out of every five black residents of New York City resides in Brooklyn (primarily in the Central, Northern, and Eastern sections of the borough), one out of every five resides in Bronx (mainly in the borough's Northeastern, Southeastern and Southern sections) one out of every five resides in Queens (mainly in the borough's Southeastern area), with the remaining black residents residing in Manhattan (primarily in Harlem) and Staten Island (mainly the North Shore of the borough).\\r\\nNative Americans make up 0.4% of New York City's population. According to the survey, there were 29,569 Native Americans residing in New York City. Of 29,569 Native Americans, 2,075 were of the Cherokee tribal grouping. In addition, 213 were of the Navajo tribal grouping. Also, 42 people identified themselves as Chippewa, and 47 people identified themselves as Sioux. There is a number of Mohawks indigenous to the New York city area and/or Upstate New York, and many Mohawks arrived in the 1930s to work in the skyscraper building construction industry.[48][unreliable source?] And a few Lenape Indians indigenous to the New York city area still remain in the city, migrated from other rural parts to Manhattan.[49]\\r\\nAsian Americans make up 11.8% of New York City's population. According to the survey, there were 976,807 Asian Americans residing in New York City. Of 976,807 Asian Americans, 445,145 were of Chinese descent, representing 5.4% of the city's population. In addition, there were 226,888 Indian Americans residing in the city, representing 2.7% of the population. Approximately 103,660 people identified themselves as \\"Other Asian\\", a category that includes people of Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong, and Pakistani descent. Individuals in this category represent 1.2% of the city's population. There were 88,162 Korean Americans residing in the city, representing 1.1% of the population. Other Asian American groups include those of Filipino (68,826, 0.8%), Japanese (26,096, 0.3%), and Vietnamese (18,030, 0.2%) descent.\\r\\nPacific Islander Americans make up 0.1% of New York City's population. According to the survey, there were 4,941 Pacific Islander Americans residing in New York City. Of 4,941 Pacific Islander Americans, 1,992 were Native Hawaiian. Approximately 904 were of Samoan descent, and 504 were of Guamanian descent. In addition, 1,541 were of other Pacific Islander ancestries.\\r\\nThere is a considerable Bulgarian population in New York. Bulgarians migrated in New York in the 1900s.[50]\\r\\nMultiracial Americans make up 2.1% of New York City's population. According to the survey, there were 177,643 multiracial Americans residing in New York City. People of black and white ancestry numbered at 37,124, making up 0.4% of the population. People of white and Asian ancestry numbered at 22,242, making up 0.3% of the population. People of white/Native American ancestry (10,762) and black/Native American ancestry (10,221) each made up 0.1% of the city's population. The term \\"Multiracial American\\", however, can be very misleading. For example, many people of Latin American background may have various racial ancestries. Furthermore, there are many Americans who have multiple racial ancestries who are not aware of it. Therefore, the actual numbers are likely much higher.\\r\\nHispanics and Latinos make up 27.5% of New York City's population. According to the American Community Survey, there were 2,287,905 Hispanic or Latino Americans residing in New York City. The Hispanic/Latino population is categorized with four groups, \\"Puerto Rican\\" (785,618 or 9.4%), \\"Mexican\\" (297,581 or 3.6%), \\"Cuban\\" (42,377 or 0.5%), and \\"Other Hispanic or Latino\\" (1,165,576 or 14.0%).[51]\\r\\nAccording to the 2006-2007 Center for Latin American, Caribbean & Latino Studies:[52]\\r\\nNote: This source contains all of the numerical information in the data above.\\r\\nWhite Americans make up 44.6% of New York City's population. According to the survey, there were 3,704,243 White Americans residing in New York City. White Americans of non-Hispanic origin make up 35.1% of the city's population. There are 2,918,976 non-Hispanic whites residing in the city. Much of New York City's European American population consists of individuals of Italian, Irish, German, Russian, Polish, English, and Greek ancestry.[53]\\r\\nAccording to the 2006ÿ2008 American Community Survey, the top ten White, European ancestries were the following:[54]\\r\\nOther smaller European ancestries include:\\r\\nAccording to a 2001 study by Claritas, four of the city's five boroughs ranked among the nation's twenty most diverse counties. Queens ranked 1st, Brooklyn 3rd, Manhattan 7th, and The Bronx 17th. In addition, Hudson County and Essex County, New Jersey, both of which are part of the New York Metropolitan Area, ranked 6th and 15th, respectively.[55]\\r\\nThe city has several demographically unique characteristics. Queens is the only large county in the United States where the median income among black households, about $52,000 a year, has surpassed that of whites.[56]\\r\\nThe New York City metropolitan area is home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel.[57] It is also home to nearly a quarter of the nation's Indian American population,[58] and the largest African American community of any city in the country. New York City, with about 800,000 Puerto Rican residents, has the largest Puerto Rican population outside of Puerto Rico. Another historically significant ethnic group are Italians, who emigrated to the city in large numbers in the early 20th century. New York City is home to the largest Italian American population in the United States. The Irish and Germans also have a notable presence.\\r\\nAmerican Indian, Native Alaskan, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander make up 2.9% of the population of NYC, and have been included with \\"Other\\".\\r\\nThe 2000 census counted 2,021,588 households with a median income of $38,293. 30% of households had children under the age of 18, and 37% were married couples living together. 19% had a single female householder, and 39% were non-families. 32% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10% were single residents 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.59 persons, and the average family size was 3.32.\\r\\nThe age range was as follows: 24% were under the age of 18, 10% between 18 and 24, 33% between 25 and 44, 21% between 45 and 64, and 12% were 65 or older. The median age in New York City in 2000 was 34 years. For every 100 females there were 90 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86 males.\\r\\nThe borough of Manhattan is experiencing a \\"baby boom\\" that is unique among U.S. cities. Since 2000, the number of children under age 5 living in Manhattan has grown by more than 32%.[62] The increase is driven mostly by affluent white families with median household incomes over $300,000.\\r\\nOverall, nominal household income in New York City is characterized by large variations. This phenomenon is especially true of Manhattan, which in 2005 was home to the highest incomes U.S. census tract, with a household income of $188,697, as well as the lowest, where household income was $9,320.[63] The disparity is driven in part by wage growth in high income brackets. In 2006 the average weekly wage in Manhattan was $1,453, the highest among the largest counties in the United States.[34] Wages in Manhattan were the fastest growing among the nation's 10 largest counties.[34] Among young adults in New York who work full-time, women now earn more money than men  approximately $5,000 more in 2005.[64]\\r\\nNew York City's borough of Manhattan is the highest nominal income county in the United States. In particular, ZIP code 10021 on Manhattan's Upper East Side, with more than 100,000 inhabitants and a per capita income of over $90,000, has one of the largest concentrations of income in the United States. The other boroughs, especially Queens and Staten Island, have large middle-class populations.\\r\\nNew York City's per capita income in 2000 was $22,402; men and women had a median income of $37,435 and $32,949 respectively. 21.2% of the population and 18.5% of families had incomes below the federal poverty line; 30.0% of this group were under the age of 18 and 17.8% were 65 and older.\\r\\nThe New Yorker with the highest wealth and income is oil magnate David H. Koch whose net worth is an estimated $44 billion (Forbes, March 2013)[65] to $34 billion (Bloomberg, April 2013),[66] an increase of $3 to $5 billion a year since 2007, when his wealth was about $12 billion.[67] Of Forbes Magazine's 400 richest American billionaires, 70 live in New York City.[65] New York City's recent mayor, Michael Bloomberg, is himself one of the nation's richest men. As of 2009 New York has regained the number one spot as the city with most billionaires (55), after losing out to Moscow in 2008.\\r\\nChristianity (59%), particularly Catholicism (33%), was the most prevalently practiced religion in New York as of 2014,[68] followed by Judaism, with approximately 1.2 million Jews in New York City,[69][70] about 14% of the population.[71]Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, and atheism are also prominent throughout New York City. In 2014, 24% self-identified with no organized religious affiliation.[68]\\r\\nNew York has ranked first in population among American cities since the first census in 1790. New York will maintain this position, although there are varying forecasts on how much the population will increase. The most realistic population projections from the Department of City Planning anticipate a 1.1 million increase by 2030, bringing the city's population total to 9.1 million.\\r\\nWhile the city's projected 2030 population will be a new high, only two boroughs, Staten Island and Queens have reached their population peak every year for the last 5 years. The study projects that by 2030, Queens will have 2.57 million people and Staten Island 552,000. Manhattan, with 1.83 million, Bronx with 1.46 million and Brooklyn with 2.72 million, will still be below their population peaks.[72]\\r\\nOn March 27, 2011, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that the city would file a formal challenge to the Census results, as a result of alleged undercounting in the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn.[73] The mayor has asserted that the numbers for Queens and Brooklyn, the two most populous boroughs, are implausible.[74] According to the Census, they grew by only 0.1% and 1.6%, respectively, while the other boroughs grew by between 3% and 5%. In addition, the Mayor claims, the census showed improbably high amounts of vacant housing in vital neighborhoods such as Jackson Heights, Queens.\\r\\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, New York City had the largest population of self-defined Black residents of any U.S. city, with over 2,000,000 within the city's boundaries, although this number has decreased since 2000.[79] New York City had more Black people than did the entire state of California until the 1980 United States Census. The Black population consists of immigrants and their descendants from Africa and the Caribbean as well as native-born African-Americans. Many of the city's black residents live in Brooklyn and The Bronx. Several of the city's neighborhoods are historical birthplaces of urban Black culture in America, among them the Brooklyn neighborhood of BedfordÿStuyvesant and Manhattan's Harlem and various sections of Eastern Queens and The Bronx. Bedford-Stuyvesant is considered to have the highest concentration of Black residents in the United States. New York City has the largest population of Black immigrants (at 686,814) and descendants of immigrants from the Caribbean (especially from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Guyana, Belize, Grenada, and Haiti), and of sub-Saharan Africans. In a news item of April 3, 2006, however, the New York Times noted that for the first time since the American Civil War, the recorded African-American population was declining, because of emigration to other regions, a declining African-American birthrate in New York, and decreased immigration of Blacks from the Caribbean and Africa.[80]\\r\\nThe New York City Metropolitan Area contains the largest ethnic Chinese population outside Asia, enumerating an estimated 735,019 individuals as of 2012,[81] including at least 9 Chinatowns, comprising the original Manhattan Chinatown, one in Queens (the Flushing Chinatown, three in Brooklyn (the Sunset Park Chinatown, the Avenue U Chinatown, and the Bensonhurst Chinatown), and one each in Edison, New Jersey and Nassau County, Long Island,[82] not to mention fledgling ethnic Chinese enclaves emerging throughout the New York City metropolitan area.[83]\\r\\nNew York City was home to an estimated 82,313 Filipinos in 2011, representing a 7.7% increase from the estimated 77,191 in 2008, with 56%, or about 46,000, in Queens.[84] Immigration from the Philippines began mainly after 1965, when immigration quotas that prevented Filipino immigration for many years were abolished. While there was earlier immigration from the Philippines, it was in low numbers and mainly concentrated in Hawaii and California. Since then, Filipinos have settled in Northeastern cities, with a majority in the New York City metropolitan area. Most of these immigrants have been professionals (doctors, nurses, other medical professions, accountants and engineers). The Filipino median household income in New York City was $81,929 in 2013, and 68% held a bachelor's degree or higher.[84]\\r\\nNew York City annually hosts the Philippine Independence Day Parade, which is traditionally held on the first Sunday of June on Madison Avenue. The celebration occupies nearly twenty-seven city blocks which includes a 3.5-hour parade and an all-day long street fair and cultural performances.\\r\\nA \\"Little Manila\\" can be found in Woodside, in the borough of Queens.[85] Filipinos are also concentrated in Jackson Heights and Elmhurst in Queens.[86] There are also smaller Filipino communities in Jamaica, Queens and parts of Brooklyn. The Benigno Aquino Triangle is located on Hillside Avenue in Hollis, Queens to commemorate the slain Filipino political leader and to recognize the large Filipino American population in the area.[87]\\r\\nAlthough not technically part of New York City, other large Filipino populations just outside the city's borders can be found in neighboring Northern and Central New Jersey, particularly in Bergen, Hudson, Middlesex,[88] and Passaic counties. By 2013 Census estimates, the New York City metropolitan area was estimated to be home to 224,266 Filipino Americans, 88.5% (about 200,000) of them single-race Filipinos.[89] Over 150,000 Fipino-born immigrants made their home in the New York City tri-state metropolitan region in 2011.[90] In 2012, a Census-estimated 235,222 single- and multi-racial Filipino Americans lived in the broader New York-Newark-Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area.[91]\\r\\nNew York City is home to 100,000 ethnic Koreans, with two-thirds living in Queens.[92] On the other hand, the overall Greater New York Combined Statistical Area[93] enumerated 218,764 Korean American residents as of the 2010 United States Census, the second-largest population of Koreans outside of Korea.[94]\\r\\nAccording to 2007 American Community Survey estimates, New York City is home to approximately 315,000 people from the Indian subcontinent, which includes the countries of India (236,117), Pakistan (39,002), Bangladesh (34,332), and Sri Lanka (5,010). South Asians constitute 3.8% of New York City's population.[95] The New York City Metropolitan Area is home to approximately 600,000 Indian Americans, representing the largest Asian Indian population in the Western Hemisphere. A majority of the South Asian residents are concentrated in Queens neighborhoods such as Jackson Heights, Flushing, City Line, Ozone Park, Glen Oaks, Floral Park, Bellerose, Jamaica, Kew Gardens, and Elmhurst. In the borough of Queens, the South Asian population is approximately near 200,000 and counting, where they constitute 8.2% of the population. South Asians from the Caribbean majority from Guyana, Trinidad, and a small number from Jamaica are also large in number.\\r\\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, there are 192,209 Asian Indians, 53,174 Bangladeshis, 41,887 Pakistanis, and 3,696 Sri Lankans in New York City.[96]\\r\\nThe New York City Metropolitan Area contains the largest Sri Lankan community in the United States (second largest in North America after Toronto, Ontario, Canada), receiving the highest legal permanent resident Sri Lankan immigrant population.[97] The Little Sri Lanka in the Tompkinsville neighborhood of the borough of Staten Island is one of the largest Sri Lankan communities outside of the country of Sri Lanka itself.[98][99]\\r\\nAs of the 2000 United States Census about over half of the 37,279 people of Japanese ancestry in New York State lived in New York City.[100]\\r\\nArabs first emigrated to New York City in the 1880s, the vast majority of them came from modern-day Lebanon and Syria. Before the advent of modern Lebanon in August 1920, and due to the political and historical nature of Ottoman-ruled Syria, the majority of Lebanese and Syrians referred to themselves as \\"Syrian\\" upon arrival to Ellis Island.[101] Little by little, starting in the 1930s, immigrants from Lebanon started referring to themselves as \\"Lebanese-American\\" and immigrants from Syria retained the designation \\"Syrian-American\\". From 1880-1960 the overwhelming majority (90%) of Lebanese and Syrian immigrants were of the Christian faith.[102] After 1960, especially after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, Arab Muslims from other Arab countries and territories such as Palestine, Jordan, and Egypt started arriving in New York. The Syrian/Lebanese mother colony was located around Washington Street in Lower Manhattan, in a neighborhood called Little Syria.[103] Syrian immigration to the United States was very small with respect to the other ethnic groups or peoples that arrived in America. In 1910, at the peak of Syrian immigration, only 60,000 Syrians entered the United States.[101]\\r\\nAround the late-1930s, Little Syria started to go into decline with the construction of skyscrapers in Lower Manhattan. In the name of urban renewal, the skyscraper era was ushered in and preceded with the destruction of five-storey tenements that Syrians called home. The final blow to Little Syria commenced with the construction of the Brooklyn battery tunnel in 1940. A large percentage of the community moved to the area around downtown Brooklyn; and set up shops and businesses on Atlantic Avenue. St. George's Syrian Catholic Church is the last physical reminder of the Syrian- and Lebanese-American community that once lived in Little Syria.[101] In Brooklyn, there are two long-time established businesses still open on Atlantic Avenue. Damascus Bakery is still in business since 1936, and Sahadi's has had a strong loyal customer base since 1948. By the 1960s, the community was to move yet again this time to Park Slope and Bay Ridge.[104]\\r\\nThe New York metro area contains the largest concentration of populations with Arab and Middle Eastern ancestry in the United States, with 230,899 residents of the metro area claiming Arab ancestry in the 2000 U.S. Census.[105] An estimated 70,000 lived in New York City as of 2000.[106][107] New York City holds the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival, founded in 2003 by comedians Dean Obeidallah and Maysoon Zayid.\\r\\nCarl Schurz, a refugee from the unsuccessful first German democratic revolution of 1848, served as United States Secretary of the Interior and as United States Senator from Missouri. Carl Schurz Park in Manhattan is named after him.\\r\\nThe influence of German immigration can still be felt in areas of New York City. The Yorkville neighborhood on the Upper East Side of Manhattan was a center of German-American culture. As of the 2000 census 255,536 New Yorkers reported German ancestry.[108]\\r\\nIn the middle of the 19th century, Little Germany, situated in what is now termed Alphabet City, was the first non-English-speaking urban enclave in the United States.\\r\\nGreek immigration to New York City began mainly in the 1890s. The push factors for immigration were the Balkan Wars and World War I. Greek immigration to New York City took place between 1890 until around 1917. In the latter years more women arrived and communities began to grow, especially in Astoria, Queens. Greeks again began to arrive in large numbers after 1945, as they fled the economic devastation caused by World War II and the Greek Civil War.\\r\\nIn the first immigration wave, most of the Greek immigrants were men. Many of them worked in industrial labor jobs, and others created a niche in the fur business. This immigration wave brought 450,000 Greeks to the Northeast, largely concentrated in New York City. The second immigration wave, taking place after 1945 and 1982, was smaller with a total of 211,000 immigrants, mostly within the Northeast. However, new immigrants helped revive assimilating Greek communities and added new energy to a sense of ethnic identity.\\r\\nThe largest concentration of Greeks can still be found in Astoria. The Greek community there was established in the early 20th century during immigration. The neighborhood still has many Greek food stores and restaurants. Residents of Greek descent make up 1.0% of New York City's population.\\r\\nThe Irish community is one of New York's major ethnic groups and has been a significant proportion of the city's population since the waves of immigration in the mid-nineteenth century. New York City's St. Patrick's Day Parade dates to 1762.\\r\\nDuring the Great Irish Famine (1845ÿ1851), Irish families were forced to emigrate from Ireland; by 1854, between 1,500,000 and 2,000,000 people were forced to leave the country - about a quarter of the pre-famine population. In the United States, most of the recently arrived Irish became city dwellers as that was where work was. In addition, arriving with little money, many settled in the cities at which their ships made port. By 1850, the Irish made up a quarter of the population in Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Their arrival in the United States before other waves of Catholic immigrants meant that ethnic Irish long dominated the Roman Catholic Church in America. They created a strong network of churches and parochial schools to support their communities.\\r\\nThe Irish have long played a significant role in city politics, the Roman Catholic Church, and the New York City Fire Department and Police Department. As of the 2000 census, 520,810 New Yorkers reported Irish ancestry.[109]\\r\\nAccording to a 2006 genetic survey by Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, about one in fifty New Yorkers of European origin carry a distinctive genetic signature on their Y chromosomes inherited from Niall of the Nine Hostages, an Irish high king of the 5th century A.D.[110][111]\\r\\nNew York City has the largest population of Italian Americans in the United States of America as well as North America, many of whom inhabit ethnic enclaves in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. New York City is home to the third largest Italian population outside of Italy, behind Sao Paulo, Brazil and Buenos Aires, Argentina, respectively.\\r\\nThe largest wave of Italian immigration to the United States took place in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Between 1870 and 1978, 5.3 million Italians immigrated to the United States, including over two million between 1900 and 1910. Only the Irish and Germans immigrated in larger numbers. Italian families first settled in Little Italy's neighborhoods, the first and most famous one being the one around Mulberry Street, in Manhattan. This settlement, however, is rapidly becoming part of the adjacent Chinatown as the older Italian residents die and their children move elsewhere. As of the 2000 census, 692,739 New Yorkers reported Italian ancestry, making them the largest European ethnic group in the city.[112] In 2011, the American Community Survey found there were 49,075 persons of Italian birth in New York City.[113]\\r\\nPolish immigration to New York City began at the end of the 20th century. In the 1980s, as a result of the Polish government's crackdown on the burgeoning Solidarno?? labor and political movement, Polish migration to the U.S. swelled. Polish-Americans and Polish immigrants in the city generally reside in Brooklyn (neighborhoods of Greenpoint and Williamsburg) and in Queens (neighborhoods of Maspeth and Ridgewood). The combined neighborhood of Greenpoint/Williamsburg is sometimes referred to as \\"Little Poland\\" because of its large population of primarily working-class Polish immigrants, reportedly the second largest concentration in the United States, after Chicago. As of the 2000 census, 213,447 New Yorkers reported Polish ancestry.[114]\\r\\nNew York is home to a number of Polish and Polish-American cultural, community, and scientific institutions, including the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America (PIASA) and the Polish Cultural Institute. Polish-language publications with circulation reaching outside the city include The Polish Review, an English-language scholarly journal published since 1956 by PIASA; Nowy Dziennik [3], founded in 1971; and Polska Gazeta [4], founded in the year 2000. The Polska Gazeta is the leading Polish-language daily newspaper in the tri-state area, delivering daily news to over 17,000 readers in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Long Island and Delaware. The Polish Newspaper SuperExpress [5], covering New York, New Jersey & Connecticut started publication in 1996.\\r\\nThe Pulaski Day Parade in New York on Fifth Avenue has been celebrated since 1937 to commemorate Kazimierz Pu?aski, a Polish hero of the American Revolutionary War. It closely coincides with the October 11 General Pulaski Memorial Day, a national observance of his death at the Siege of Savannah, and his held on the first Sunday of October. In these parades march Polish dancers, Polish soccer teams and their mascots, Polish Scouts - ZHP and Polish school ambassadors and representatives, such as Mikolaj Pastorino (Nicholas Pastorino) and Lech Wa??sa. The Pulaski Day Parade is one of the largest parades in New York City.\\r\\nThe Romanian community of New York City is the largest such community in North America. The 2000 Census reported 161,900 Romanians were living in New York City. They are mainly concentrated in Queens, as well as in parts of Manhattan and Staten Island. The Romanian Day Festival, for which the City closes a section of Broadway, demonstrates the strong sense of community of Romanians living in New York.\\r\\nNew York City contains a very large and growing Russian-Jewish population estimated at around 300,000. There are large numbers of Russian-Jews in Brooklyn, mostly in neighborhoods of Southern Brooklyn, notably Brighton Beach, also known as \\"Little Odessa\\", where there are many businesses and billboards with signage entirely in the Russian language. There is a significant Russian Orthodox population in New York City as well.\\r\\nNew York City contains a large and growing Ukrainian population. New York's Ukrainian population was traditionally centered around the East Village in Manhattan, as well as Brighton Beach (also known as \\"Little Odessa\\"), in Brooklyn. Urban flight and recent waves of new immigration have spread Ukrainians throughout the boroughs, with a heavy concentration in Brooklyn.\\r\\nThe New York metropolitan area is home to the largest Jewish population in the world outside Israel. While most are descendants of Jews who moved from Europe, a growing number are of Asian and Middle Eastern origin. After dropping from a peak of 2.5 million in the 1950s to a low of 1.4 million in 2002 the population of Jews in the New York metropolitan area grew to 1.54 million in 2011. A study by the UJA-Federation of New York released in 2012[115] showed that the proportion of liberal Jews was decreasing while the proportion of generally conservative Orthodox Jews and recent immigrants from Russia was increasing. Much of this growth is in Brooklyn, which in 2012 was 23% Jewish and where most of the Russian immigrants live and nearly all of the ultra-orthodox.[116] The study by UJA-Federation of New York has been criticized by J.J. Goldberg, an observer at The Jewish Daily Forward, as excluding suburban Jews, for example in New Jersey, that are outside the service area of UJA-Federation of New York and also for lack of granularity with respect to the Orthodox of New York City.[117] The New York metropolitan area's Jewish population in 2001 was approximately 1.97 million, 600,000 fewer than in Israel's largest metropolitan area, denoted as Gush Dan. In 2012, an estimated 1,086,000 Ashkenazic Jews lived in New York City and constituted about 12% of the city's population, while approximately 100,000 Sephardic Jews live in the city too. New York City is also home to the world headquarters of the Hasidic Chabad-Lubavitch group and the Bobover, Pupa, Vizhnitz and Satmar branches of Hasidism, ultra-Orthodox sects of Judaism.[citation needed] Many notable Jews come from New York City.\\r\\nThe first Jewish presence in New York City dates to the arrival of 23 Jewish refugees in 1654, who fled from Recife, Brazil, after the Portuguese conquered New Holland and brought the Inquisition with them.[118] Major immigration of Jews to New York began in the 1880s, with the increase of Anti-Semitic actions in Central and Eastern Europe. The number of Jews in New York City soared throughout the beginning of the 20th century and reached a peak of 2 million in the 1950s, when Jews constituted one-quarter of the city's population. New York City's Jewish population then began to decline because of low fertility rates and migration to suburbs and other states, particularly California and Florida.\\r\\nA new wave of Ashkenazi, Kavkazi, Bukharian, and Georgian Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union began arriving in the 1980s and 1990s. Sephardic Jews including Syrian, Moroccan and other Jews of non-European origin have also lived in New York City since the 17th century. Many Jews, including the newer immigrants, have settled in Queens, south Brooklyn, and the Bronx, where at present most live in neighborhoods such as Riverdale.[citation needed] Sephardic Jews estimated at 100,000 strong have settled along Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn creating a unified community consisting of about 75,000 people in this area, while the other Sephardic Jews live in the Upper East Side of Manhattan and in Staten Island.\\r\\n19th-century Jewish immigrants settled mainly in the tenement houses of the Lower East Side of Manhattan. New York City's current Jewish population is dispersed among all the boroughs; Brooklyn's Jewish population in 2011 was estimated as 561,000, and Manhattan's was 240,000.[119]\\r\\nThe Orthodox community is rapidly growing due to higher birthrates among Orthodox (especially Hasidic) Jews, while the numbers of Conservative and Reform Jews are declining.[120] 60% of the Jewish children in New York are Orthodox, 37% Hasidic. This accelerating dynamic is accompanied by a substantial rise in the percentage of Jews who live in poverty.[116]\\r\\nLike the Irish and Italian, the Jewish community has played an important role in recent New York City politics; Jewish voters traditionally vote in large numbers and have often supported politically liberal policies. As the proportion of liberal Conservative and Reform Jews decreases and that of conservative Russian and Orthodox Jews increases in the 21st Century the political interests of New York Jews are changing. The Russian immigrants have shown a tendency to vote Republican while the ultra-orthodox are social conservatives who have a pressing need for supportive social services. There is little support among either group for the liberal community institutions which have been built by the liberal Jewish community. A significant portion of the rapidly growing Hasidic community is pro-Israel and supports the Israeli Settlement Movement.\\r\\nNew York City has the largest Puerto Rican population outside of Puerto Rico. Attributable to the changing citizenship status of the island's residents, Puerto Ricans can technically be said to have come to the City first as immigrants and subsequently as migrants. The first group of Puerto Ricans moved to New York in the mid-19th century, when Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony and its people Spanish subjects. The following wave of Puerto Ricans to move to New York did so after the SpanishÿAmerican War of 1898 made Puerto Rico a U.S. possession and after the JonesÿShafroth Act of 1917 gave Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship, which allows travel without the need of a passport between the island and the United States mainland. The largest wave of migration came in the 1950s, in what became known as \\"The Great Migration\\"; as a result, more than a million Puerto Ricans once called New York City home. Presently the Puerto Rican population is around 800,000.\\r\\nPuerto Ricans have historically lived in neighborhoods such as the Lower East Side (also known in the community as Loisaida), Spanish Harlem and Williamsburg, Brooklyn since the 1950s. However, there has been an increase in Puerto Ricans in outlying areas of the city, such as the North Shore of Staten Island, and the eastern Bronx.\\r\\nImmigration records of Dominicans in the United States date from the late 19th century, and New York City has had a Dominican community since the 1930s. From the 1960s onward, after the fall of the Rafael Trujillo military regime, large waves of migration have thoroughly transnationalized the Dominican Republic, metaphorically blurring its frontier with the United States.\\r\\nIn 2006 New York City's Dominican population decreased for the first time since the 1980s, dropping by 1.3% from 609,885 in 2006 to 602,093 in 2007. They are the city's second-largest Hispanic group and, in 2009, it was estimated that they composed 24.9% of New York City's Latino population. According to Census data analysis by CUNYs Center for Latin American, Caribbean & Latino Studies, shows Dominicans as the new largest group of Hispanics in NYC. There were about 747,473 Dominicans in the five boroughs in 2013, compared with 719,444 Puerto Ricans.[121]\\r\\nAreas with high a concentration of Dominicans are in Washington Heights, Corona, and certain areas in the Bronx.\\r\\nAt the 2010 Census, there were 457,288 Mexican Americans living in New York City.[122] In 2009, it was estimated that of the city's Hispanic population, 13.5% was of Mexican origin.[121] Mexicans are the fastest growing group of Hispanic population.[79] Some estimates suggest that Mexicans will surpass both Puerto Ricans and Dominicans in 2023 to become the citys largest national Latino sub-group.[121] As of 2011, the Mexican Consulate estimated about 500,000 Mexicans lived in New York City, of whom 35,000 spoke a Mexican indigenous language.[123]\\r\\nIn 2009, it was estimated that 211,378 Ecuadorian Americans lived in New York City, representing 8.9% of the city's Hispanic population. They are the fourth largest sub-group of Hispanics, after Puerto Ricans, Dominicans and Mexicans.[121]\\r\\nColombians have come in small numbers to New York City since the 1950s. The major exodus of Colombians from Colombia came in the 1970s and early 1980s when many of Colombia's cities were facing hardships from drug traffickers, crime and lack of employment. 75% of Colombians in New York City live in Queens, specifically in Jackson Heights, Corona, Elmhurst and Murray Hill.[124]\\r\\nSince 1990, the Salvadoran population has been growing very rapidly in New York City. More than 50% of Salvadorans live in Queens, and the growth of their population is most notable in South Jamaica and Far Rockaway. Many Salvadorans reside in the Bronx as well. There are also pockets of Salvadorans in Brooklyn and in East Harlem, Manhattan.","input":"What is the most populated borough in nyc?"},{"output":"uly 2, 1928,","context":"","input":"When was the television introduced to the public?"},{"output":"The Shard in Southwark, London","context":"This is a list of the tallest buildings in the United Kingdom.

Heavier, sour crude oils lacking in tidewater accesssuch as Western Canadian Select are less expensive than lighter, sweeter oilsuch as WTI.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960 the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was founded in Baghdad, Iraq by its first five members Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela,[4][5][6] with Qatar and Libya joining immediately, followed by United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Nigeria, Ecuador and Gabon after a decade. The goal of these countries was to increase its influence in the world oil market, then dominated by a cartel known as the \\"Seven Sisters\\", five of which were headquartered in the United States.[5] These companies had been controlling posted prices since the so-called 1927 Red Line Agreement and 1928 Achnacarry Agreement, and had achieved a high level of price stability until 1972.[5] Angola joined the OPEC in 2007 and Equatorial Guinea in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1999 til mid 2008, the price of oil rose significantly. It was explained by the rising oil demand in countries like China and India.[7]\\r\\nIn the middle of the financial crisis of 2007ÿ2008, the price of oil underwent a significant decrease after the record peak of US$147.27 it reached on July 11, 2008. On December 23, 2008, WTI crude oil spot price fell to US$30.28 a barrel, the lowest since the financial crisis of 2007ÿ2010 began. The price sharply rebounded after the crisis and rose to US$82 a barrel in 2009.[8] In July 2008 oil reached a record peak of US$147.27 but by February 2009 it sank beneath $40 a barrel.[9] On 31 January 2011, the Brent price hit $100 a barrel for the first time since October 2008, on concerns about the political unrest in Egypt.[10] For about three and half years the price largely remained in the $90ÿ$120 range. In the middle of 2014, price started declining due to a significant increase in oil production in USA, and declining demand in the emerging countries.[11] The oil glutcaused by multiple factorsspurred a sharp downward spiral in the price of oil that continued through February 2016.[12] By February 3, 2016 oil was below $30[13] a drop of \\"almost 75 percent since mid-2014 as competing producers pumped 1ÿ2 million barrels of crude daily exceeding demand, just as China's economy hit lowest growth in a generation.\\"[14] Some analysts speculate that it may continue to drop further, perhaps as low as $18[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a report released on February 15, 2016 by Deloitte LLPthe audit and consulting firmwith global crude oil at near ten-year low prices, 35% of listed E&P oil and gas companies are at a high risk of bankruptcy worldwide.[16][17] Indeed, bankruptcies \\"in the oil and gas industry could surpass levels seen in the Great Recession.\\"[16][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two views dominating the oil market discourse. There are those who strongly believe that the market has undergone structural changes and that low oil prices are here to stay for a prolonged period. At the other end of the spectrum, there are those who think that this is yet another cycle and oil prices will recover sooner rather than later.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2016 survey of the academic literature finds that \\"most major oil price fluctuations dating back to 1973 are largely explained by shifts in the demand for crude oil\\".[20] As the global economy expands, so does demand for crude oil.[20] The authors note that the price of oil has also increased at times due to greater \\"demand for stocks (or inventories) of crude oil... to guard against future shortages in the oil market. Historically, inventory demand has been high in times of geopolitical tension in the Middle East, low spare capacity in oil production, and strong expected global economic growth.\\"[20] In particular, political events can have a strong influence on the oil price. Historical examples include OPECs 1973 embargo in reaction to the Yom Kippur War and the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Financial analysts and academics have had very few tools to study such political events compared to what is available on economic aspects of oil price formation.[21] The PRIX index was developed in attempt to fill this gap with a metric on political developments and corresponding export trends from worlds 20 largest oil exporters.[21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supply of oil is dependent on geological discovery, the legal and tax framework for oil extraction, the cost of extraction, the availability and cost of technology for extraction, and the political situation in oil-producing countries. Both domestic political instability in oil producing countries and conflicts with other countries can destabilise the oil price. In 2008 the New York Times reported, for example, in the 1940s the price of oil was about $17 rising to just over $20 during the Korean War (1951ÿ1953). During the Vietnam War (1950s?ÿ 1970s) the price of oil slowly declined to under $20. During the Arab oil embargo of 1973the first oil shockthe price of oil rapidly rose to double in price. During the 1979 Iranian Revolution the price of oil rose. During the second oil shock the price of oil peaked in April 1980 at $103.76. During the 1980s there was a period of \\"conservation and insulation efforts\\" and the price of oil dropped slowly to c.?$22. It again reached a peak of c. $65 during the 1990 Persian Gulf crisis and war. Following that, there was a period of global recessions and the price of oil hit a low of c.?$15 before it peaked at a high of $45 on September 11, 2001[23] only to drop again to a low of $26 on May 8, 2003.[14] The price rose to $80 with the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. By March 3, 2008 the price of oil reached $103.95 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the oil price is largely determined by the balance between supply and demandas with all commoditiessome commentators including Business Week, the Financial Times and the Washington Post, argued that the rise in oil prices prior to the financial crisis of 2007ÿ2008 was due to speculation in futures markets.[24][25][26][27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a dissenting view of oil prices being determined by demand, see Forbes, \\"Global Oil Demand is Always Rising ÿ and Not Related to Price\\".[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn North America this generally refers to the WTI Cushing Crude Oil Spot Price West Texas Intermediate (WTI), also known as Texas Light Sweet, a type of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing and the underlying commodity of New York Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts. WTI is a light crude oil, lighter than Brent Crude oil. It contains about 0.24% sulfur, rating it a sweet crude, sweeter than Brent. Its properties and production site make it ideal for being refined in the United States, mostly in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions. WTI has an API gravity of around 39.6 (specific gravity approx. 0.827) per barrel (159 liters) of either WTI/light crude as traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) for delivery at Cushing, Oklahoma. Cushing, Oklahoma, a major oil supply hub connecting oil suppliers to the Gulf Coast, has become the most significant trading hub for crude oil in North America.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Europe and some other parts of the world, the oil price benchmark is Brent as traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE, into which the International Petroleum Exchange has been incorporated) for delivery at Sullom Voe.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther important benchmarks include Dubai, Tapis, and the OPEC basket. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) uses the imported refiner acquisition cost, the weighted average cost of all oil imported into the US, as its \\"world oil price\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Robert Mabro's 2006 book on challenges and opportunities in oil in the 21st century, after the collapse of the OPEC-administered pricing system in 1985, and a short lived experiment with netback pricing, oil-exporting countries adopted a market-linked pricing mechanism.[30] First adopted by PEMEX in 1986, market-linked pricing received wide acceptance and by 1988 became and still is the main method for pricing crude oil in international trade.[30]  The current reference, or pricing markers, are Brent, WTI, and Dubai/Oman.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nOil is marketed among other products in commodity markets. By 2008 widely traded oil futures, and related natural gas futures, included with most of these oil futures having delivery dates every month:[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2008 Business Week reported that the surge in oil prices prior to 2008 had led some commentators to argue that at least some of the rise was due to speculation in the futures markets.[24] However, although speculation can greatly raise the oil price in the short run, in the long run fundamental market conditions will determine the oil price. Storing oil is expensive, and all speculators must ultimately, and generally within a few months, sell the oil they purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) May 29, 2008 report the \\"Multiple Energy Market Initiatives\\" was launched in partnership with the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority and ICE Futures Europe in order to expand surveillance and information sharing of various futures contracts.  Part 1 is \\"Expanded International Surveillance Information for Crude Oil Trading.\\"[28]  This announcement has received wide coverage in the financial press, with speculation about oil futures price manipulation.[25][26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interim report by the Interagency Task Force, released in July, found that speculation had not caused significant changes in oil prices and that fundamental supply and demand factors provide the best explanation for the crude oil price increases. The report found that the primary reason for the price increases was that the world economy had expanded at its fastest pace in decades, resulting in substantial increases in the demand for oil, while the oil production grew sluggishly, compounded by production shortfalls in oil-exporting countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe report stated that as a result of the imbalance and low price elasticity, very large price increases occurred as the market attempted to balance scarce supply against growing demand, particularly in the last three years. The report forecast that this imbalance would persist in the future, leading to continued upward pressure on oil prices, and that large or rapid movements in oil prices are likely to occur even in the absence of activity by speculators. The task force continues to analyze commodity markets and intends to issue further findings later in the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strategy works because oil prices for delivery in the future are trading at a premium to those in the spot market ÿ a market structure known in the industry as contango ÿ with investors expecting prices to eventually recover from the near 60 percent slide in oil in the last seven months.\\r\\nThe oil-storage trade, also referred to as contango, a market strategy in which large, often vertically-integrated oil companies purchase oil for immediate delivery and storagewhen the price of oil is low and hold it in storage until the price of oil increases. Investors bet on the future of oil prices through a financial instrument, oil futures in which they agree on a contract basis, to buy or sell oil at a set date in the future. Crude oil is stored in salt mines, tanks and oil tankers.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nInvestors can choose to take profits or losses prior to the oil-delivery date arrives. Or they can leave the contract in place and physical oil is \\"delivered on the set date\\" to an \\"officially designated delivery point\\", in the United States, that is usually Cushing, Oklahoma. When delivery dates approach, they close out existing contracts and sell new ones for future delivery of the same oil. The oil never moves out of storage. If the forward market is in \\"contango\\"the forward price is higher than the current spot pricethe strategy is very successful.\\r\\n\\r\\nScandinavian Tank Storage AB and its founder Lars Jacobsson introduced the concept on the market in early 1990.[34] But it was in 2007 through 2009 the oil storage trade expanded,[35] with many participantsincluding Wall Street giants, such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Citicorpturning sizeable profits simply by sitting on tanks of oil.[36] By May, 2007 Cushing's inventory fell by nearly 35% as the oil-storage trade heated up.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The trend follows a spike in oil futures prices that has created incentives for traders to buy crude oil and oil products at current rates, sell them on futures markets and store them until delivery.\\"\\r\\nBy the end of October 2009 one in twelve of the largest oil tankers was being used more for temporary storage of oil, rather than transportation.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom June 2014 to January 2015, as the price of oil dropped 60 percent and the supply of oil remained high, the world's largest traders in crude oil purchased at least 25 million barrels to store in supertankers to make a profit in the future when prices rise. Trafigura, Vitol, Gunvor, Koch, Shell and other major energy companies began to book booking oil storage supertankers for up to 12 months. By 13 January 2015 At least 11 Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) and Ultra Large Crude Carriers (ULCC)\\" have been reported as booked with storage options, rising from around five vessels at the end of last week. Each VLCC can hold 2 million barrels.\\"[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015 as global capacity for oil storage was out-paced by global oil production, and an oil glut occurred. Crude oil storage space became a tradable commodity with CME Group which owns NYMEX offering oil-storage futures contracts in March 2015.[33] Traders and producers can buy and sell the right to store certain types of oil.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 5 March 2015, as oil production outpaces oil demand by 1.5 million barrels a day, storage capacity globally is dwindling.[33] In the United States alone, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, U.S. crude-oil supplies are at almost 70% of the U. S. storage capacity, the highest to capacity ratio since 1935.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nPeak oil is the period when the maximum rate of global petroleum extraction is reached, after which the rate of production enters terminal decline. It relates to a long-term decline in the available supply of petroleum.  This, combined with increasing demand, will significantly increase the worldwide prices of petroleum derived products.  Most significant will be the availability and price of liquid fuel for transportation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US Department of Energy in the Hirsch report indicates that \\"The problems associated with world oil production peaking will not be temporary, and past \\"energy crisis\\" experience will provide relatively little guidance.\\"[40] The 2014 United Nations World Economic Situation and Prospects report notes that \\"Oil prices were on a downward trend in the first half of 2013 (after a spike in January and February caused by geopolitical tensions with Iran), as global demand for oil weakened along with the deceleration in world economic growth overall.\\" [41]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the United Nations, world oil demand is projected to reach over 99 million barrels per day in 2018.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nA major rise or decline in oil price can have both economic and political impacts. The decline on oil price during 1985ÿ1986 is considered to have contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union.[43] Low oil prices could alleviate some of the negative effects associated with the resource curse, such as authoritarian rule[44][45][46][47][48] and gender inequality.[49][50] Lower oil prices could however also lead to domestic turmoil and diversionary war. The reduction in food prices that follows lower oil prices could have positive impacts on violence globally.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch shows that declining oil prices make oil-rich states less bellicose.[52] Low oil prices could also make oil-rich states engage more in international cooperation, as they become more dependent on foreign investments.[53] The influence of the United States reportedly increases as oil prices decline, at least judging by the fact that \\"both oil importers and exporters vote more often with the United States in the United Nations General Assembly\\" during oil slumps.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe macroeconomics impact on lower oil prices is lower inflation. A lower inflation rate is good for the consumers. This means that the general price of a basket of goods would increase at a bare minimum on a year to year basis. Consumer can benefit as they would have a better purchasing power, which may improve real gdp [54]. However, in recent countries like Japan, the decrease in oil prices may cause deflation and it shows that consumers are not willing to spend even though the prices of goods are decreasing yearly, which indirectly increases the real debt burden.[54]\\r\\nDeclining oil prices may boost consumer oriented stocks but may hurt oil-based stocks.[55][56] It is estimated that 17ÿ18% of S&P would decline with declining oil prices.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oil importing economies like EU, Japan, China or India would benefit, however the oil producing countries would lose.[57][58][59] A Bloomberg article presents results of an analysis by Oxford Economics on the GDP growth of countries as a result of a drop from $84 to $40. It shows the GDP increase between 0.5% to 1.0% for India, USA and China, and a decline of greater than 3.5% from Saudi Arabia and Russia. A stable price of $60 would add 0.5 percentage point to global gross domestic product.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatina Stefanova has argued that falling oil prices do not imply a recession and a decline in stock prices.[60] Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, had earlier written that  that  positive impact on consumers and businesses outside of the energy sector, which is a larger portion of the US economy will outweigh the negatives.[61] Taking cues from a legendary oil investor, Harold Hamm, ranked as one of the richest men in the world by Forbes, Shawn Baldwin, Chairman of alternative investment firm The AIA Group, speculates that oil prices will rise by year-end 2016 from current levels.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomists have observed that the 2015ÿ2016 oil glut also known as 2010s oil glut started with a considerable time-lag, more than six years after the beginning of the Great Recession: \\"the price of oil [had] stabilized at a relatively high level (around $100 a barrel) unlike all  previous recessionary cycles since 1980 (start of First Persian Gulf War). But nothing guarantee[d] such price levels in perpetuity\\".[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 2014ÿ2015, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a marked slowdown in economic growth. At the same time, U.S. oil production nearly doubled from 2008 levels, due to substantial improvements in shale \\"fracking\\" technology in response to record oil prices. A combination of factors led a plunge in U.S. oil import requirements and a record high volume of worldwide oil inventories in storage, and a collapse in oil prices that continues into 2016.[64][65][66]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has also been argued that the collapse in oil prices in 2015 should be very beneficial for developed western economies, who are generally oil importers and aren't over exposed to declining demand from China.[67] In the Asia-Pacific region, exports and economic growth were at significant risk across economies reliant on commodity exports as an engine of growth. The most vulnerable economies were those with a high dependence on fuel and mineral exports to China, such as: Korea DPR, Mongolia and Turkmenistan ÿ where primary commodity exports account for 59ÿ99% of total exports and more than 50% of total exports are destined to China. The decline in Chinas demand for commodities also adversely affected the growth of exports and GDP of large commodity-exporting economies such as Australia (minerals) and the Russian Federation (fuel). On the other hand, lower commodity prices led to an improvement in the trade balance ÿ through lower the cost of raw materials and fuels ÿ across commodity importing economies, particularly Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal and other remote island nations (Kiribati, Maldives, Micronesia (F.S), Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu) which are highly dependent on fuel and agricultural imports [68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North Sea oil and gas industry was financially stressed by the reduced oil prices, and called for government support in May 2016.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of hedging using commodity derivatives as a risk management tool on price exposure to liquidity and earnings, has been long established in North America. Chief Financial Officers (CFOS) use derivatives to dampen, remove or mitigate price uncertainty.[70] Bankers also use hedge funds to more \\"safely increase leverage to smaller oil and gas companies.\\"[70] However, when not properly used, \\"derivatives can multiply losses\\"[70] particularly in North America where investors are more comfortable with higher levels of risk than in other countries.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the large number of bankruptcies as reported by Deloitte[18] \\"funding [for upstream oil industry] is shrinking and hedges are unwinding.\\"[16] \\"Some oil producers are also choosing to liquidate hedges for a quick infusion of cash, a risky bet.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Access to capital markets, bankers' support and derivatives protection, which helped smooth an otherwise rocky road, are fast waning...The roughly 175 companies at risk of bankruptcy have more than $150 billion in debt, with the slipping value of secondary stock offerings and asset sales further hindering their ability to generate cash.\\"\\r\\nTo finance exploration and production of the unconventional shale oil industry in the United States, \\"hundreds of billions of dollars of capital came from non-bank participants [non-bank buyers of bank energy credits] in leveraged loans] that were thought at the time to be low risk.[71] However, with the oil glut that continued into 2016, about a third of oil companies are facing bankruptcy.[18] While investors were aware that there was a risk that the operator might declare bankruptcy, they felt protected because \\"they had come in at the 'bank' level, where there was a senior claim on the assets [and] they could get their capital returned.\\"[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 2012,[70]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"... in recent years the combination of the development of large resource plays in the US and the emergence of business models designed to ensure consistent dividend payouts to investors has led to the development of more aggressive hedging policies in companies and less restrictive covenants in bank loans.\\"\\r\\nA classic example of taking on too much risk through hedging is the 1982 collapse of Penn Square Bank caused by plummeting of the price of oil in 1981.[71] Penn Square Bank had lent too much to Exploration and Production E&P operators. Penn Square Bank caused the failure of Seafirst in 1982 and then Continental Illinois.[71] When they failed and were liquidated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) the non-bank buyers or participants of bank energy credits of these leveraged loans participants were considered to be 'unsecured claims,' not 'true sales' and they were not able to collect any capital.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 5th annual World Pensions Forum in 2015, Jeffrey Sachs advised institutional investors to divest from carbon-reliant oil industry firms in their pension fund's portfolio.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of oversupply and lack of agreements between oil-producing countries members of the OPEC (Saudi Arabia in particular, which pumped at world's records) and also because of lack of coordinated efforts between OPEC and Non-OPEC countries (Russian being a big player, refusing to reduce production) the price of oil fell rapidly in 2015 and continued to slide in 2016 causing the cost of WTI crude to fall to a 10-year low of $26.55 on January 20. The average price of oil in January 2016 was well below $35. Oil did not recover until April 2016, when oil went above the $45 mark.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 20 January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bblless than one-fourth of its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($147.27), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.[66] According to the United Nations, growth prospects of the oil exporters are predicted to remain subdued past 2018.[74]","input":"When did the oil and gas downturn start?"},{"output":"Zelda II: The Adventure of Link","context":"","input":"What is the second legend of zelda game?"},{"output":"Numerous canal barges","context":"Seneca Lake is the largest of the glacial Finger Lakes of the U.S. state of New York, and the deepest lake entirely within the state. It is promoted as being the lake trout capital of the world, and is host of the National Lake Trout Derby. Because of its depth and relative ease of access, the US Navy uses Seneca Lake to perform test and evaluation of equipment ranging from single element transducers to complex sonar arrays and systems.[1] The lake takes its name from the Seneca nation of Native Americans. At the north end of Seneca Lake is the city of Geneva, New York, home of Hobart and William Smith Colleges and the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station, a division of Cornell University. At the south end of the lake is the village of Watkins Glen, New York, famed for auto racing and waterfalls.\\r\\nDue to Seneca Lake's unique macroclimate it is home to over 50 wineries, many of them farm wineries and is the location of the Seneca Lake AVA. (See Seneca Lake wine trail).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 38 miles (61?km) long, it is the second longest of the Finger Lakes and has the largest volume, estimated at 3.81 cubic miles (15.9?km3), roughly half of the water in all the Finger Lakes. It has an average depth of 291 feet (89?m),[2] a maximum depth of 618 feet (188?m), and a surface area of 66.9 square miles (173?km2).\\r\\nFor comparison, Scotland's famous Loch Ness is 22.5 miles (36.2?km) long, 1.7 miles (2.7?km) wide, has a surface area of 21.8 square miles (56?km2), an average depth of 433 feet (132?m), a maximum depth of 744.6 feet (227.0?m), and total volume of 1.8 cubic miles (7.5?km3) of water.\\r\\nSeneca's two main inlets are Catharine Creek at the southern end and the Keuka Lake Outlet. Seneca Lake lets out into the Seneca River/ Cayuga-Seneca Canal, which joins Seneca and Cayuga Lakes at their northern ends.\\r\\nIt is fed by underground springs and replenished at a rate of 328,000 gallons (1240 m3) per minute. These springs keep the water moving in a circular motion, giving it little chance to freeze over. Because of Seneca Lake's great depth its temperature remains a near-constant 39?F (4?C).[3] In summer the top 10 to 15 feet (3.0 to 4.6?m) warms to 70ÿ80?F (21ÿ27?C).\\r\\nSeneca lake has a typical aquatic population for large deep lakes in the northeast, with coldwater fish such as lake trout and Atlantic salmon inhabiting the deeper waters, and warmwater fish such as smallmouth bass and yellow perch inhabiting the shallower areas. The lake is also home to a robust population of \\"sawbellies\\", the local term for gizzard shad.\\r\\nSeneca Lake was formed at least two million years ago by glacial carving of streams and valleys. Originally it was a part of a series of rivers that flowed northward. Around this time many continental glaciers moved into the area and started the Pleistocene glaciation also known as the Ice Age. It is presumed that the Finger Lakes were created by many advances and retreats of massive glaciers that were up to 2 miles wide. [4]\\r\\nOver 200 years ago, there were Iroquois villages on Seneca Lake's surrounding hillsides. During the American Revolutionary War, their villages, including Kanadaseaga (\\"Seneca Castle\\"), were wiped out during the 1779 Sullivan Expedition by Continental troops under order by General George Washington to invade their homeland, destroy their dwellings and crops, and end their threat to the patriots. They destroyed nearly 50 Seneca and Cayuga villages. Today roadside signs trace Sullivan and Clinton's route along the east side of Seneca Lake where the burning of villages and crops occurred.\\r\\nAfter the war, the Iroquois were forced to cede their land when Britain was defeated. Their millions of acres were sold and some lands in this area were granted to veterans of the army in payment for their military service. A slow stream of European-American settlers began to arrive circa 1790. Initially the settlers were without a market nearby or a way to get their crops to market. The settlers' isolation ended in 1825 with the opening of the Erie Canal.\\r\\nThe canal linked the Finger Lakes Region to the outside world. Steamships, barges and ferries quickly became Seneca Lake's ambassadors of commerce and trade. The former, short Crooked Lake Canal linked Seneca Lake to Keuka Lake.\\r\\nNumerous canal barges sank during operations and rest on the bottom of the lake. A collection of barges at the southwest end of the lake, near the village of Watkins Glen, is being preserved and made accessible for scuba diving by the Finger Lakes Underwater Preserve Association.\\r\\nThe lake is a popular fishing destination from all around. Fish species present in the lake include lake trout, rainbow trout, brown trout, landlocked salmon, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, northern pike, pickerel, and yellow perch.[5]\\r\\nThe painted rocks located at the southern end of the lake on the eastern cliff face depict an American flag, Tee-pee, and several Native Americans. The older paintings, located on the bottom of the cliff, were said to have been drawn in 1779 after the Senecas escaped men from John Sullivan's campaign. However, this account is questioned by historian Barbara Bell, arguing that it is unlikely that the Senecas would have returned to paint the paintings having just escaped from Sullivan's men. She suggests instead that these paintings may have been made much later, for tourists on Seneca Lake boat tours.[6]\\r\\nIt is known that the more visible and prominent paintings of the Native Americans, American flag, and Tee-pee were added in 1929 during the Sullivan Sesquicentennial. There are two mistakes in these 1929 additions: firstly the Native Americans in the Seneca Region used longhouses and not Tee-pees, and secondly the flag is displayed pointing to the left which is never to be done on a horizontal surface.[citation needed]\\r\\nSeneca Lake is also the site of strange and currently unexplained cannon-like booms and shakes that are heard and felt in the surrounding area. They are known locally as the Seneca Guns, Lake Drums, or Lake Guns, and these types of phenomena are known elsewhere as skyquakes. The term Lake Guns originated in the short story \\"The Lake Gun\\" by James Fenimore Cooper in 1851.[7] There is no explanation that takes into account sounds the Iroquois heard before Cooper's time; it is possible sonic booms have been mistaken for natural sounds in modern days.[8]\\r\\nThe east side of Seneca Lake was once home to a military training ground called Sampson Naval Base, primarily used during World War II. It became Sampson Air Force Base during the Korean War and was used for basic training. After Sampson AFB closed, the airfield remained as Seneca Army Airfield but was closed in 2000.[9] The training grounds of Sampson have since been converted to a civilian picnic area called Sampson State Park.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere is still a Naval facility at Seneca Lake, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Sonar test facility. A scale model of the sonar section of the nuclear submarine USS Seawolf (SSN 21) was tested during the development of this ship,[citation needed] which was launched in June, 1995.\\r\\nThere is a YSI EMM-2500 Buoy Platform located in the north end of Seneca Lake roughly in the center. Its coordinates are: latitude: 4241'49.99\\"N, longitude: 7655'29.93\\"W. The buoy has cellular modem communications and measures wind speed and direction, relative humidity, air temperature, barometric pressure, light intensity, and the water's depth and temperature, conductivity, turbidity, and chlorophyll-a levels.[10]\\r\\nThe buoy was initially deployed in June 2006. The water depth where it is located is about 200 feet (61?m).[11]\\r\\nViticulture and winemaking in the area date back to the 19th century, with the foundation of the Seneca Lake Wine Company in 1866 marking the first major winery in the area. The modern era of wine production began in the 1970s with the establishment of several wineries and the passage of the New York Farm Winery Act of 1976.[12] The region was established as an American Viticultural Area in 1988.[citation needed]\\r\\nSeneca Lake Wine Trail hosts many events on and around the lake, annually. With more than 30 wineries currently located on the shores of Seneca Lake, the winter 'Deck the Halls' event is a great time at the lake with participating wineries showcasing their vintages and pairing these wines with distinctive, tasty treats. Wineries also provide participants with an ornament at each stop to commemorate the event.","input":"What is at the bottom of seneca lake?"},{"output":"(125 missions)","context":"These are the names of the missions of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

The structure links the American city of San Francisco, California ÿ the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula ÿ to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco, California, and the United States. It has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.[7]\\r\\nThe Frommer's travel guide describes the Golden Gate Bridge as \\"possibly the most beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world.\\"[8][9] At the time of its opening in 1937, it was both the longest and the tallest suspension bridge in the world, with a main span of 4,200 feet (1,280?m) and a total height of 746 feet (227?m). Today, the Golden Gate Bridge is neither the longest nor the tallest in the world, but remains the tallest bridge in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the bridge was built, the only practical short route between San Francisco and what is now Marin County was by boat across a section of San Francisco Bay. A ferry service began as early as 1820, with a regularly scheduled service beginning in the 1840s for the purpose of transporting water to San Francisco.[10]\\r\\nThe Sausalito Land and Ferry Company service, launched in 1867, eventually became the Golden Gate Ferry Company, a Southern Pacific Railroad subsidiary, the largest ferry operation in the world by the late 1920s.[10][11] Once for railroad passengers and customers only, Southern Pacific's automobile ferries became very profitable and important to the regional economy.[12] The ferry crossing between the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco and Sausalito in Marin County took approximately 20 minutes and cost US$1.00 per vehicle, a price later reduced to compete with the new bridge.[13] The trip from the San Francisco Ferry Building took 27 minutes.\\r\\nMany wanted to build a bridge to connect San Francisco to Marin County. San Francisco was the largest American city still served primarily by ferry boats. Because it did not have a permanent link with communities around the bay, the city's growth rate was below the national average.[14] Many experts said that a bridge could not be built across the 6,700?ft (2,042?m) strait, which had strong, swirling tides and currents, with water 372?ft (113?m) deep[15] at the center of the channel, and frequent strong winds. Experts said that ferocious winds and blinding fogs would prevent construction and operation.[14]\\r\\nAlthough the idea of a bridge spanning the Golden Gate was not new, the proposal that eventually took hold was made in a 1916 San Francisco Bulletin article by former engineering student James Wilkins.[16] San Francisco's City Engineer estimated the cost at $100 million, which would have been $2.12 billion in 2009, and impractical for the time. He asked bridge engineers whether it could be built for less.[10] One who responded, Joseph Strauss, was an ambitious engineer and poet who had, for his graduate thesis, designed a 55-mile-long (89?km) railroad bridge across the Bering Strait.[17] At the time, Strauss had completed some 400 drawbridgesmost of which were inlandand nothing on the scale of the new project.[3] Strauss's initial drawings[16] were for a massive cantilever on each side of the strait, connected by a central suspension segment, which Strauss promised could be built for $17?million.[10]\\r\\nLocal authorities agreed to proceed only on the assurance that Strauss would alter the design and accept input from several consulting project experts.[citation needed] A suspension-bridge design was considered the most practical, because of recent advances in metallurgy.[10]\\r\\nStrauss spent more than a decade drumming up support in Northern California.[18] The bridge faced opposition, including litigation, from many sources. The Department of War was concerned that the bridge would interfere with ship traffic. The navy feared that a ship collision or sabotage to the bridge could block the entrance to one of its main harbors. Unions demanded guarantees that local workers would be favored for construction jobs. Southern Pacific Railroad, one of the most powerful business interests in California, opposed the bridge as competition to its ferry fleet and filed a lawsuit against the project, leading to a mass boycott of the ferry service.[10]\\r\\nIn May 1924, Colonel Herbert Deakyne held the second hearing on the Bridge on behalf of the Secretary of War in a request to use federal land for construction. Deakyne, on behalf of the Secretary of War, approved the transfer of land needed for the bridge structure and leading roads to the \\"Bridging the Golden Gate Association\\" and both San Francisco County and Marin County, pending further bridge plans by Strauss.[19] Another ally was the fledgling automobile industry, which supported the development of roads and bridges to increase demand for automobiles.[13]\\r\\nThe bridge's name was first used when the project was initially discussed in 1917 by M.M. O'Shaughnessy, city engineer of San Francisco, and Strauss. The name became official with the passage of the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District Act by the state legislature in 1923, creating a special district to design, build and finance the bridge.[20] San Francisco and most of the counties along the North Coast of California joined the Golden Gate Bridge District, with the exception being Humboldt County, whose residents opposed the bridge's construction and the traffic it would generate.[21]\\r\\nStrauss was chief engineer in charge of overall design and construction of the bridge project.[14] However, because he had little understanding or experience with cable-suspension designs,[22] responsibility for much of the engineering and architecture fell on other experts. Strauss's initial design proposal (two double cantilever spans linked by a central suspension segment) was unacceptable from a visual standpoint. The final graceful suspension design was conceived and championed by Leon Moisseiff, the engineer of the Manhattan Bridge in New York City.[23]\\r\\nIrving Morrow, a relatively unknown residential architect, designed the overall shape of the bridge towers, the lighting scheme, and Art Deco elements, such as the tower decorations, streetlights, railing, and walkways. The famous International Orange color was originally used as a sealant for the bridge.[24] The US Navy had wanted it to be painted with black and yellow stripes to ensure visibility by passing ships.[14]\\r\\nSenior engineer Charles Alton Ellis, collaborating remotely with Moisseiff, was the principal engineer of the project.[25] Moisseiff produced the basic structural design, introducing his \\"deflection theory\\" by which a thin, flexible roadway would flex in the wind, greatly reducing stress by transmitting forces via suspension cables to the bridge towers.[25] Although the Golden Gate Bridge design has proved sound, a later Moisseiff design, the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, collapsed in a strong windstorm soon after it was completed, because of an unexpected aeroelastic flutter.[26] Ellis was also tasked with designing a \\"bridge within a bridge\\" in the southern abutment, to avoid the need to demolish Fort Point, a preÿCivil War masonry fortification viewed, even then, as worthy of historic preservation. He penned a graceful steel arch spanning the fort and carrying the roadway to the bridge's southern anchorage.[27]\\r\\nEllis was a Greek scholar and mathematician who at one time was a University of Illinois professor of engineering despite having no engineering degree. He eventually earned a degree in civil engineering from the University of Illinois prior to designing the Golden Gate Bridge and spent the last twelve years of his career as a professor at Purdue University. He became an expert in structural design, writing the standard textbook of the time.[28] Ellis did much of the technical and theoretical work that built the bridge, but he received none of the credit in his lifetime. In November 1931, Strauss fired Ellis and replaced him with a former subordinate, Clifford Paine, ostensibly for wasting too much money sending telegrams back and forth to Moisseiff.[28] Ellis, obsessed with the project and unable to find work elsewhere during the Depression, continued working 70 hours per week on an unpaid basis, eventually turning in ten volumes of hand calculations.[28]\\r\\nWith an eye toward self-promotion and posterity, Strauss downplayed the contributions of his collaborators who, despite receiving little recognition or compensation,[22] are largely responsible for the final form of the bridge. He succeeded in having himself credited as the person most responsible for the design and vision of the bridge.[28] Only much later were the contributions of the others on the design team properly appreciated.[28] In May 2007, the Golden Gate Bridge District issued a formal report on 70 years of stewardship of the famous bridge and decided to give Ellis major credit for the design of the bridge.\\r\\nThe Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District, authorized by an act of the California Legislature, was incorporated in 1928 as the official entity to design, construct, and finance the Golden Gate Bridge.[14] However, after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the District was unable to raise the construction funds, so it lobbied for a $30?million bond measure. The bonds were approved in November 1930,[17] by votes in the counties affected by the bridge.[29] The construction budget at the time of approval was $27?million. However, the District was unable to sell the bonds until 1932, when Amadeo Giannini, the founder of San Franciscoÿbased Bank of America, agreed on behalf of his bank to buy the entire issue in order to help the local economy.[10]\\r\\nConstruction began on January 5, 1933.[10] The project cost more than $35?million,[30] ($3.45?billion in 2016 dollars[31]) completing ahead of schedule and $1.3 million under budget.[32] The Golden Gate Bridge construction project was carried out by the McClintic-Marshall Construction Co., a subsidiary of Bethlehem Steel Corporation founded by Howard H. McClintic and Charles D. Marshall, both of Lehigh University.\\r\\nStrauss remained head of the project, overseeing day-to-day construction and making some groundbreaking contributions. A graduate of the University of Cincinnati, he placed a brick from his alma mater's demolished McMicken Hall in the south anchorage before the concrete was poured. He innovated the use of movable safety netting beneath the construction site, which saved the lives of many otherwise-unprotected ironworkers. Of eleven men killed from falls during construction, ten were killed on February 17, 1937, when the bridge was near completion when the net failed under the stress of a scaffold that had fallen.[33] According to Travel Channel's Monumental Mysteries, the workers' platform that was attached to a rolling hanger on a track collapsed when the bolts that were connected to the track were too small and the amount of weight was too great to bear. The platform fell into the safety net, but was too heavy and the net gave way. Two out of the twelve workers survived the 200-foot (61?m) fall into the icy waters, including the 37-year-old foreman, Slim Lambert. Nineteen others who were saved by the net over the course of construction became members of their Half Way to Hell Club.[34]\\r\\nThe project was finished and opened May 27, 1937. The Bridge Round House diner was then included in the southeastern end of the Golden Gate Bridge, adjacent to the tourist plaza which was renovated in 2012.[35] The Bridge Round House, an Art Deco design by Alfred Finnila completed in 1938, has been popular throughout the years as a starting point for various commercial tours of the bridge and an unofficial gift shop.[36] The diner was renovated in 2012[35] and the gift shop was then removed as a new, official gift shop has been included in the adjacent plaza.[36]\\r\\nDuring the bridge work, the Assistant Civil Engineer of California Alfred Finnila had overseen the entire iron work of the bridge as well as half of the bridge's road work.[37] With the death of Jack Balestreri in April 2012, all workers involved in the original construction are now deceased.\\r\\nThe bridge-opening celebration began on May 27, 1937 and lasted for one week. The day before vehicle traffic was allowed, 200,000 people crossed either on foot or on roller skates.[10] On opening day, Mayor Angelo Rossi and other officials rode the ferry to Marin, then crossed the bridge in a motorcade past three ceremonial \\"barriers\\", the last a blockade of beauty queens who required Joseph Strauss to present the bridge to the Highway District before allowing him to pass. An official song, \\"There's a Silver Moon on the Golden Gate\\", was chosen to commemorate the event. Strauss wrote a poem that is now on the Golden Gate Bridge entitled \\"The Mighty Task is Done.\\" The next day, President Roosevelt pushed a button in Washington, D.C. signaling the official start of vehicle traffic over the Bridge at noon. As the celebration got out of hand there was a small riot in the uptown Polk Gulch area. Weeks of civil and cultural activities called \\"the Fiesta\\" followed. A statue of Strauss was moved in 1955 to a site near the bridge.[16]\\r\\nIn May 1987, as part of the 50th anniversary celebration, the Golden Gate Bridge district again closed the bridge to automobile traffic and allowed pedestrians to cross the bridge. However, this celebration attracted 750,000 to 1,000,000 people, and ineffective crowd control meant the bridge became congested with roughly 300,000 people, causing the center span of the bridge to flatten out under the weight.[38] Although the bridge is designed to flex in that way under heavy loads, and was estimated not to have exceeded 40% of the yielding stress of the suspension cables,[39] bridge officials stated that uncontrolled pedestrian access was not being considered as part of the 75th anniversary on Sunday, May 27, 2012,[40][41][42] because of the additional law enforcement costs required \\"since 9/11\\".[43]\\r\\nA pedestrian poses at the old railing on opening day, 1937\\r\\nOpening of the Golden Gate Bridge\\r\\nOfficial invitation to the opening of the bridge. This copy was sent to the City of Seattle\\r\\nUntil 1964, the Golden Gate Bridge had the longest suspension bridge main span in the world, at 4,200 feet (1,300?m). Since 1964 its main span length has been surpassed by ten bridges; it now has the second-longest main span in the United States, after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York City. The total length of the Golden Gate Bridge from abutment to abutment is 8,981 feet (2,737?m).[44]\\r\\nThe Golden Gate Bridge's clearance above high water averages 220 feet (67?m) while its towers, at 746 feet (227?m) above the water,[44] were the world's tallest on a suspension bridge until 1993 when it was surpassed by the Mezcala Bridge, in Mexico. The Golden Gate Bridge remains the tallest bridge in the United States.\\r\\nThe weight of the roadway is hung from 250 pairs of vertical suspender ropes, which are attached to two main cables. The main cables pass over the two main towers and are fixed in concrete at each end. Each cable is made of 27,572 strands of wire. The total length of galvanized steel wire used to fabricate both main cables is estimated to be 80,000 miles (130,000?km).[44]\\r\\nThe bridge has approximately 1,200,000 total rivets.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe color of the bridge is officially an orange vermilion called international orange.[45] The color was selected by consulting architect Irving Morrow[46] because it complements the natural surroundings and enhances the bridge's visibility in fog. Aesthetics was the foremost reason why the first design of Joseph Strauss was rejected. Upon re-submission of his bridge construction plan, he added details, such as lighting, to outline the bridge's cables and towers.[47] In 1999, it was ranked fifth on the List of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects.\\r\\nThe bridge was originally painted with red lead primer and a lead-based topcoat, which was touched up as required. In the mid-1960s, a program was started to improve corrosion protection by stripping the original paint and repainting the bridge with zinc silicate primer and vinyl topcoats.[48][45] Since 1990, acrylic topcoats have been used instead for air-quality reasons. The program was completed in 1995 and it is now maintained by 38 painters who touch up the paintwork where it becomes seriously corroded.[49]\\r\\nA view of the Golden Gate Bridge from the Marin Headlands on a foggy morning at sunrise\\r\\nView of the northern tower of the bridge\\r\\nMost maps and signage mark the bridge as part of the concurrency between U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1. Although part of the National Highway System, the bridge is not officially part of California's Highway System.[50] For example, under the California Streets and Highways Code  401, Route 101 ends at \\"the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge\\" and then resumes at \\"a point in Marin County opposite San Francisco\\". The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District has jurisdiction over the segment of highway that crosses the bridge instead of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).\\r\\nThe movable median barrier between the lanes is moved several times daily to conform to traffic patterns. On weekday mornings, traffic flows mostly southbound into the city, so four of the six lanes run southbound. Conversely, on weekday afternoons, four lanes run northbound. During off-peak periods and weekends, traffic is split with three lanes in each direction.[51]\\r\\nFrom 1968 to 2015, opposing traffic was separated by small, plastic pylons, and during that time, there were 16 fatalities resulting from 128 head-on collisions.[52] To improve safety, the speed limit on the Golden Gate Bridge was reduced from 50 to 45?mph (80 to 72?km/h) on October 1, 1989.[53] Although there had been discussion concerning the installation of a movable barrier since the 1980s, only in March 2005 did the Bridge Board of Directors commit to finding funding to complete the $2?million study required prior to the installation of a movable median barrier.[52] Installation of the resulting barrier was completed on January 11, 2015, following a closure of 45.5 hours to private vehicle traffic, the longest in the bridge's history. The new barrier system, including the zipper trucks, cost approximately $30.3 million to purchase and install.[52][54]\\r\\nThe bridge is popular with pedestrians and bicyclists, and was built with walkways on either side of the six vehicle traffic lanes. Initially, they were separated from the traffic lanes by only a metal curb, but railings between the walkways and the traffic lanes were added in 2003, primarily as a measure to prevent bicyclists from falling into the roadway.[55]\\r\\nThe main walkway is on the eastern side, and is open for use by both pedestrians and bicycles in the morning to mid-afternoon during weekdays (5 am to 3:30?pm), and to pedestrians only for the remaining daylight hours (until 6?pm, or 9?pm during DST). The eastern walkway is reserved for pedestrians on weekends (5 am to 6?pm, or 9?pm during DST), and is open exclusively to bicyclists in the evening and overnight, when it is closed to pedestrians. The western walkway is open only for bicyclists and only during the hours when they are not allowed on the eastern walkway.[56]\\r\\nBus service across the bridge is provided by two public transportation agencies: San Francisco Muni and Golden Gate Transit. Muni offers Saturday and Sunday service on the Marin Headlands Express bus line, and Golden Gate Transit runs numerous bus lines throughout the week.[57][58] The southern end of the bridge, near the toll plaza and parking lot, is also accessible daily from 5:30?a.m. to midnight by Muni line 28.[59] The Marin Airporter, a private company, also offers service across the bridge between Marin County and San Francisco International Airport.[60]\\r\\nA visitor center and gift shop, dubbed the \\"Bridge Pavilion\\", is located on the San Francisco side of the bridge, adjacent to the southeast parking lot. It opened in 2012, in time for the bridge's 75th anniversary celebration. A cafe, outdoor exhibits, and restroom facilities are located nearby.[61] On the Marin side of the bridge, only accessible from the northbound lanes, is the H. Dana Bower Rest Area and Vista Point,[62] named after the first landscape architect for the California Division of Highways.[63]\\r\\nLands and waters under and around the bridge are homes to varieties of wildlife such as bobcats and sea lions.[64][65] Three species of cetaceans that had been absent in the area for many years show recent recoveries/(re)colonizations vicinity to the bridge, and researchers study them to strengthen protections, concerning actions by public and recommending to watch whales either from the bridge and nearby, or to use a local whale watching operator.[66][67][68]\\r\\nThe last of the construction bonds were retired in 1971, with $35?million in principal and nearly $39?million in interest raised entirely from bridge tolls.[53]\\r\\nIn November 2006, the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District recommended a corporate sponsorship program for the bridge to address its operating deficit, projected at $80?million over five years. The District promised that the proposal, which it called a \\"partnership program,\\" would not include changing the name of the bridge or placing advertising on the bridge itself. In October 2007, the Board unanimously voted to discontinue the proposal and seek additional revenue through other means, most likely a toll increase.[69][70]\\r\\nIn an effort to save $19.2?million over the following 10 years, the Golden Gate District voted in January 2011 to eliminate all toll takers by 2012 and use only open road tolling.[71] Subsequently, this was delayed and toll taker elimination occurred in March 2013. The cost savings have been revised to $19 million over an eight-year period. In addition to the FasTrak electronic toll collection system, the Golden Gate District implemented the use of license plate tolling (branded as \\"Pay-by-Plate\\"), and also a one time payment system for drivers to pay before or after their trip on the bridge. Twenty-eight positions were eliminated as part of this plan.[72]\\r\\nOn April 7, 2014, the toll for users of FasTrak was increased from $5 to $6, while the toll for drivers using either the license plate tolling or the one time payment system was raised from $6 to $7. Bicycle, pedestrian, and northbound motor vehicle traffic remain toll free. For vehicles with more than two axles, the toll rate is $7 per axle for those using license plate tolling or the one time payment system, and $6 per axle for FasTrak users. During peak traffic hours, carpool vehicles carrying two or more people and motorcycles pay a discounted toll of $4; drivers must have Fastrak to take advantage of this carpool rate.[72] The Golden Gate Transportation District then planned to increase the tolls by 25 cents in July 2015, and then by another 25 cents each of the next three years.[73]\\r\\nIn March 2008, the Golden Gate Bridge District board approved a resolution to start congestion pricing at the Golden Gate Bridge, charging higher tolls during the peak hours, but rising and falling depending on traffic levels. This decision allowed the Bay Area to meet the federal requirement to receive $158?million in federal transportation funds from USDOT Urban Partnership grant.[75] As a condition of the grant, the congestion toll was to be in place by September 2009.[76][77]\\r\\nThe first results of the study, called the Mobility, Access and Pricing Study (MAPS), showed that a congestion pricing program is feasible.[78] The different pricing scenarios considered were presented in public meetings in December 2008.[79]\\r\\nIn August 2008, transportation officials ended the congestion pricing program in favor of varying rates for metered parking along the route to the bridge including on Lombard Street and Van Ness Avenue.[80]\\r\\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is the second-most used suicide site/suicide bridge in the world, after the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.[81] The deck is about 245 feet (75?m) above the water.[82] After a fall of four seconds, jumpers hit the water at around 75?mph or about 120?km/h. Most of the jumpers die from impact trauma. About 5% of the jumpers survive the initial impact but generally drown or die of hypothermia in the cold water.[83][84]\\r\\nAfter years of debate and over an estimated 1,500 deaths, suicide barriers began to be installed in April 2017. Construction will take approximately four years at a cost of over $200 million.[85]\\r\\nSince its completion, the Golden Gate Bridge has been closed because of weather conditions only three times: on December 1, 1951, because of gusts of 69?mph (111?km/h); on December 23, 1982, because of winds of 70?mph (113?km/h); and on December 3, 1983, because of wind gusts of 75?mph (121?km/h).[48]\\r\\nAn anemometer, placed midway between the two towers on the west side of the bridge, has been used to measure wind speeds. Another anemometer was placed on one of the towers.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern knowledge of the effect of earthquakes on structures led to a program to retrofit the Golden Gate to better resist seismic events. The proximity of the bridge to the San Andreas Fault places it at risk for a significant earthquake. Once thought to have been able to withstand any magnitude of foreseeable earthquake, the bridge was actually vulnerable to complete structural failure (i.e., collapse) triggered by the failure of supports on the 320-foot (98?m) arch over Fort Point.[86] A $392?million program was initiated to improve the structure's ability to withstand such an event with only minimal (repairable) damage. One challenging undertaking is completing this program without disrupting traffic. A complex electro-hydraulic synchronous lift system was custom built for construction of temporary support towers and a series of intricate lifts, transferring the loads from the existing bridge onto the temporary supports. This was completed with engineers from Balfour Beatty and Enerpac, accomplishing this task without disrupting day-to-day San Francisco commuter traffic.[87][88] The retrofit was planned to be completed in 2012.[88][89]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former elevated approach to the Golden Gate Bridge through the San Francisco Presidio, known as Doyle Drive, dated to 1933 and was named after Frank P. Doyle, President and son of the founder of the Exchange Bank in Santa Rosa, and the man who, more than any other person, made it possible to build the Golden Gate Bridge.[90] The highway carried about 91,000 vehicles each weekday between downtown San Francisco and the North Bay and points north.[91] The road was deemed \\"vulnerable to earthquake damage\\", had a problematic 4-lane design, and lacked shoulders, and a San Francisco County Transportation Authority study recommended that it be replaced. Construction on the $1?billion[92] replacement, temporarily known as the Presidio Parkway, began in December 2009.[93] The elevated Doyle Drive was demolished on the weekend of April 27ÿ30, 2012, and traffic used a part of the partially completed Presidio Parkway, until it was switched onto the finished Presidio Parkway on the weekend of July 9ÿ12, 2015. As of May 2012, an official at Caltrans said there is no plan to permanently rename the portion known as Doyle Drive.[94]\\r\\nAs a prominent American landmark, the Golden Gate Bridge has been used in numerous media which includes books, films and video games.","input":"How many workers died building the golden gate?"},{"output":"1 July 2013","context":"The local property tax (LPT) is annual self-assessed tax charged on the market value of all residential properties in Ireland. It came into effect on 1 July 2013 and is collected by the Revenue Commissioners. The tax is assessed on residential properties, with the owner a property being liable (though in the case of leases over twenty years, the tenant becomes liable). The revenue raised is used to fund the provision of services by local authorities and includes transfers between local authorities. Such services currently include public parks; libraries; open spaces and leisure amenities; planning and development; fire and emergency services; maintenance and cleaning of streets; and street lighting. Some recent media reports dispute that such services have been funded from 2013 property tax receipts.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tax is based upon the assessed market value of the property in May 2013. This valuation is to be used as the basis for a half-year payment in 2013, as well as 3 further full year payments in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The tax due is calculated via a system of market bands. The initial national central rate of the tax is 0.18% of a property's value up to ?1 million, and in the case of properties valued over ?1 million, 0.25% on the balance. From 1 January 2015, local authorities will be able to vary LPT rates -/+ 15% of the national central rate.\\r\\nIn the case of properties valued over ?1 million, no banding applies ÿ 0.18% is charged on the first ?1 million (?1,800) and 0.25% on the balance. The government estimates that 85% to 90% of all properties falls within the first five taxation bands.[1][2]\\r\\nProperties which suffer from pyrite problems are exempt from the property tax initially.\\r\\nOn 6 May 2013, the Revenue Commissioners reported that 1.2 m household lds (74%) have paid the property tax.[3] In August 2013, the Revenue said 1.58 m households have paid the tax, and over ?175 m has been collected.[4] Anyone who still has not paid by August 2013, will have the tax deducted from their salary or pension.[4]\\r\\nThe household charge was introduced by the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011,[5] for collection in 2012. It was a flat-rate charge of ?100 on each principal private residence, and acted as a precursor for the local property tax.\\r\\nThe non-principal private residence charge was introduced by the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009,[6] for collection from 2009 to 2012. It was a flat-rate charge of ?200, that was payable respect of residential property that was not the owner's only or main residence.\\r\\nThe residential property tax was introduced in the Finance Act 1983[7] and was abolished on 5 April 1997.\\r\\nIt was an annual tax, charged at the rate of 1.5% per annum on the portion of the market value of an owner-occupied house which was greater than (in 1996) S101,000, as long as the household income exceeded S30,100.\\r\\nExemption from the RPT was possible[8] if certain buildings[9] were open to the public. This means that the exemption from RPT was possible in the case of property such as Charles Haughey's Kinsealy mansionpartially open for the Irish Cancer Society's Daffodil Day.\\r\\nPrior to 1977, all property owners in Ireland had to pay \\"rates\\" ÿ based on the \\"rateable valuation\\" of the property ÿ to the local council.
