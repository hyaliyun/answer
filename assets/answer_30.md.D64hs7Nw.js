The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 -- 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and ethnic minorities .

The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress in domestic affairs from 1937 -- 1964 ."},{"query":"love island who was dumped from the island","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"the very large array radio telescope new mexico usa","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Karl G.

The area 's recorded history begins with the arrival of French explorers , missionaries and fur traders in the late 17th century and their interaction with the local Potawatomi Indians . There were small settlements and a U.S. Army fort , but the soldiers and settlers were all driven off in 1812 . The modern city was incorporated in 1837 by Northern businessmen and grew rapidly from real estate speculation and the realization that it had a commanding position in the emerging inland transportation network , based on lake traffic and railroads , controlling access from the Great Lakes into the Mississippi River basin . Despite a fire in 1871 that destroyed the central business district , the city grew exponentially , becoming the nation 's rail center and the dominant Midwestern center for manufacturing , commerce , finance , higher education , religion , broadcasting , sports , jazz , and high culture . The city was a magnet for European immigrants -- at first Germans , Irish and Scandinavians , then from the 1890s to 1914 , Jews , Czechs , Poles and Italians . They were all absorbed in the city 's powerful ward - based political machines . Many joined militant labor unions , and Chicago became notorious for its violent strikes , and high wages . Large amounts of African Americans migrated from the South starting in the World War I era as part of the Great Migration . Mexicans started arriving after 1910 , and Puerto Ricans after 1945 .

Daley , who was chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party . Deindustrialization after 1970 closed the stockyards and most of the steel mills and factories , but the city retained its role as a financial and transportation hub . Increasingly it emphasized its service roles in medicine , higher education and tourism . The city formed the political base for national leaders of the Democratic Party , especially Stephen A.

Plasmodesmata evolved independently in several lineages , and species that have these structures include members of the Charophyceae , Charales , Coleochaetales and Phaeophyceae ( which are all algae ) , as well as all embryophytes , better known as land plants . Unlike animal cells , almost every plant cell is surrounded by a polysaccharide cell wall . Neighbouring plant cells are therefore separated by a pair of cell walls and the intervening middle lamella , forming an extracellular domain known as the apoplast . Although cell walls are permeable to small soluble proteins and other solutes , plasmodesmata enable direct , regulated , symplastic transport of substances between cells . There are two forms of plasmodesmata : primary plasmodesmata , which are formed during cell division , and secondary plasmodesmata , which can form between mature cells ."},{"query":"when did they stop circulating $500 bills","short_answer":"","abstract":"Large denominations of United States currency greater than $100 were circulated by the United States Treasury until 1969 .

It is composed of a renal corpuscle and a renal tubule . The renal corpuscle consists of a tuft of capillaries called a glomerulus and an encompassing Bowman 's capsule . The renal tubule extends from the capsule . The capsule and tubule are connected and are composed of epithelial cells with a lumen . A healthy adult has 0.8 to 1.5 million nephrons in each kidney . Blood is filtered as it passes through three layers : the endothelial cells of the capillary wall , its basement membrane , and between the foot processes of the podocytes of the lining of the capsule . The tubule has adjacent peritubular capillaries that run between the descending and ascending portions of the tubule . As the fluid from the capsule flows down into the tubule , it is processed by the epithelial cells lining the tubule : water is reabsorbed and substances are exchanged ( some are added , others are removed ) ; first with the interstitial fluid outside the tubules , and then into the plasma in the adjacent peritubular capillaries through the endothelial cells lining that capillary . This process regulates the volume of body fluid as well as levels of many body substances .

Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone .

They advance Luther 's positions against what he saw as the abuse of the practice of clergy selling plenary indulgences , which were certificates believed to reduce the temporal punishment for sins committed by the purchasers or their loved ones in purgatory . In the Theses , Luther claimed that the repentance required by Christ in order for sins to be forgiven involves inner spiritual repentance rather than merely external sacramental confession . He argued that indulgences led Christians to avoid true repentance and sorrow for sin , believing that they could forgo it by purchasing an indulgence . They also , according to Luther , discouraged Christians from giving to the poor and performing other acts of mercy , believing that indulgence certificates were more spiritually valuable . Though Luther claimed that his positions on indulgences accorded with those of the Pope , the Theses challenge a fourteenth - century papal bull stating that the pope could use the treasury of merit and the good deeds of past saints to forgive temporal punishment for sins . The Theses are framed as propositions to be argued in debate rather than necessarily representing Luther 's opinions , but Luther later clarified his views in the Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences ."},{"query":"when was the tax cut and jobs act passed","short_answer":"November 2 , 2017","abstract":"Pub.

Compared to wood fuels , coal yields a higher amount of energy per mass and can often be obtained in areas where wood is not readily available . Though it was used historically as a domestic fuel , coal is now used mostly in industry , especially in smelting and alloy production as well as electricity generation . Large - scale coal mining developed during the Industrial Revolution , and coal provided the main source of primary energy for industry and transportation in industrial areas from the 18th century to the 1950s . Coal remains an important energy source because of its low cost and abundance compared to other fuels , particularly for electricity generation . Coal is also mined today on a large scale by open pit methods wherever the coal strata strike the surface or are relatively shallow .

RNAP locally opens the double - stranded DNA ( usually about four turns of the double helix ) so that one strand of the exposed nucleotides can be used as a template for the synthesis of RNA , a process called transcription . A transcription factor and its associated transcription mediator complex must be attached to a DNA binding site called a promoter region before RNAP can initiate the DNA unwinding at that position . RNAP has intrinsic helicase activity , therefore no separate enzyme is needed to unwind the DNA ( in contrast to DNA polymerase ) . RNAP not only initiates RNA transcription , it also guides the nucleotides into position , facilitates attachment and elongation , has intrinsic proofreading and replacement capabilities , and termination recognition capability . In eukaryotes , RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million nucleotides ."},{"query":"how was the battle of coral sea fought","short_answer":"","abstract":"Southeast Asia"},{"query":"where was the movie fun in acapulco filmed","short_answer":"","abstract":"Fun in Acapulco is a 1963 American musical comedy film starring Elvis Presley and Ursula Andress ."},{"query":"who selects the replacement for a vice president who died in office","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Vice President of the United States ( informally referred to as VPOTUS , or Veep ) is a constitutional officer in the legislative branch of the federal government of the United States as the President of the Senate under Article One , Section Three of the U.S. Constitution ."},{"query":"countries that can travel to uk without visa","short_answer":"","abstract":"The visa policy of the United Kingdom is the policy by which Her Majesty 's Government determines who may and may not enter the country of the United Kingdom , and the Crown dependencies of Guernsey , Jersey , and the Isle of Man .

In such systems , while chances for third party candidates winning election to major national office are remote , it is possible for groups within the larger parties , or in opposition to one or both of them , to exert influence on the two major parties . In contrast , in the United Kingdom and Australia and in other parliamentary systems and elsewhere , the term two - party system is sometimes used to indicate an arrangement in which two major parties dominate elections but in which there are viable third parties which do win seats in the legislature , and in which the two major parties exert proportionately greater influence than their percentage of votes would suggest ."},{"query":"where does the transmission of electrical impulses in the heart begin","short_answer":"sinoatrial node","abstract":"The electrical conduction system of the heart transmits signals generated usually by the sinoatrial node to cause contraction of the heart muscle .

Children have to learn to distinguish different sounds and to segment the speech stream they are exposed to into units -- eventually meaningful units -- in order to acquire words and sentences . Here is one reason that speech segmentation is challenging : When you read , there are spaces between the words . No such spaces occur between spoken words . So , if an infant hears the sound sequence \`\` thisisacup , '' it has to learn to segment this stream into the distinct units \`\` this '' , \`\` is '' , \`\` a '' , and \`\` cup . '' Once the child is able to extract the sequence \`\` cup '' from the speech stream it has to assign a meaning to this word . Furthermore , the child has to be able to distinguish the sequence \`\` cup '' from \`\` cub '' in order to learn that these are two distinct words with different meanings . Finally , the child has to learn to produce these words . The acquisition of native language phonology begins in the womb and is n't completely adult - like until the teenage years .

This particular biochemistry probably represents the origins of catecholamine overload ( PO ) to a molecule . In biology , phosphorylation and its counterpart , dephosphorylation , are critical for many cellular processes . A large fraction of proteins ( between 1 / 3 to 2 / 3 of the proteome in eukaryotes ) are temporarily phosphorylated , as are many sugars , lipids , and other molecules . Phosphorylation is especially important for protein function as this modification activates ( or deactivates ) almost half of the enzymes , thereby regulating their function . Protein phosphorylation is considered the most abundant post-translational modification in eukaryotes . Phosphorylation can occur on Serine , Threonine and Tyrosine side chains ( often called ' residues ' ) through phosphoester bond formation , on Histidine , Lysine and Arginine through phosphoramidate bonds , and on Aspartic Acid and Glutamic Acid through mixed anhydride linkages . Recent evidence confirms widespread Histidine phosphorylation at both the 1 and 3 N - atoms of the imidazole ring Recent work from 2017 ( preprinted at BioRxiv ) suggests widespread human protein phosphorylation on multiple non-canonical amino acids , including motifs containing phosphorylated histidine , aspartate , glutamate , arginine and lysine in HeLa cell extracts . Due to the chemical lability of these phosphorylated residues , and in marked contrast to Ser , Thr and Tyr phosphorylation , the analysis of phosphorylated Histidine using standard biochemical and mass spectrometric approaches is much more challenging and special procedures and separation techniques are required for their preservation alongside classical Ser , Thr and Tyr phosphorylation ."},{"query":"what was the altar used for in the old testament","short_answer":"","abstract":"Altars ( Hebrew : מִזְבֵּחַ ‬ , mizbeaḥ , \`\` a place of slaughter or sacrifice '' ) in the Hebrew Bible were typically made of earth ( Exodus 20 : 24 ) or unwrought stone ( 20 : 25 ) .

They are sometimes called blockers ; examples include alpha blockers , beta blockers , and calcium channel blockers . In pharmacology , antagonists have affinity but no efficacy for their cognate receptors , and binding will disrupt the interaction and inhibit the function of an agonist or inverse agonist at receptors . Antagonists mediate their effects by binding to the active site or to the allosteric site on a receptor , or they may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor 's activity . Antagonist activity may be reversible or irreversible depending on the longevity of the antagonist -- receptor complex , which , in turn , depends on the nature of antagonist -- receptor binding . The majority of drug antagonists achieve their potency by competing with endogenous ligands or substrates at structurally defined binding sites on receptors ."},{"query":"policy carried out by germany using a strategy called blitzkrieg","short_answer":"","abstract":"Blitzkrieg ( German , \`\` lightning war '' listen ( help info ) ) is a method of warfare whereby an attacking force , spearheaded by a dense concentration of armoured and motorised or mechanised infantry formations with close air support , breaks through the opponent 's line of defence by short , fast , powerful attacks and then dislocates the defenders , using speed and surprise to encircle them .

Unlike a direct free kick , a goal may not be scored directly from the kick ; the ball must first come into contact with another player ( from either team ) . If the ball goes into the goal without touching any other player , a goal kick is awarded . The law was derived from the Sheffield Rules that stated that no goal could be scored from a free kick . This law was absorbed into the Laws of the Game in 1877 and later adapted to allow indirect free kicks as a result of dangerous play . An indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team when a player infringes certain technical requirements of the laws ( e.g. touching the ball a second time following a restart , or the keeper touching the ball with his hands when a teammate has used his foot to pass it back to the keeper ) . An indirect free kick is also awarded to the opposing team when play is stopped to caution or send - off a player when no specific foul has occurred ( e.g. when play is stopped to caution a player for dissenting the decision of the referee ) .
