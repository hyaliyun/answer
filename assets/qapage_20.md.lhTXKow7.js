David Fricke of Rolling Stone magazine once said, \\"You cannot talk about rock in the 1970s without talking about Grand Funk Railroad!\\"[1][2] Known for their crowd-pleasing arena rock style, the band was well-regarded by audiences despite a relative lack of critical acclaim.[3] The band's name is a play on words of the Grand Trunk Western Railroad, a line that runs through the band's home town of Flint, Michigan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band was formed as a trio in 1969 by Mark Farner (guitar, vocals) and Don Brewer (drums, vocals) from Terry Knight and the Pack, and Mel Schacher (bass) from Question Mark & the Mysterians. Knight soon became the band's manager, as well as naming the band as a play on words for the Grand Trunk Western Railroad, a well-known rail line in Michigan. First achieving recognition at the 1969 Atlanta International Pop Festival I, the band was signed by Capitol Records. After a raucous, well-received set on the first day of the festival, the group was asked back to play at the 1970 Atlanta International Pop Festival II the following year. Patterned after hard-rock power trios such as Cream, the band, with Terry Knight's marketing savvy, developed its own popular style. In August 1969, the band released its first album titled On Time, which sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold record in 1970.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1970, a second album, Grand Funk (or The Red Album), was awarded gold status.[4] Despite critical pans and a lack of airplay, the group's first six albums (five studio releases and one live album) were quite successful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hit single \\"I'm Your Captain (Closer to Home)\\", from the album Closer to Home, released in 1970, was considered stylistically representative of Terry Knight and the Pack's recordings. In 1970, Knight launched an intensive advertising campaign to promote the album Closer to Home. That album was certified multiplatinum despite a lack of critical approval.[4] The band spent $100,000 on a New York City Times Square billboard to advertise Closer to Home.[5] By 1971, Grand Funk equalled the Beatles' Shea Stadium attendance record, but sold out the venue in just 72 hours whereas the Beatles concert took a few weeks to sell out.[6] Following Closer to Home, Live Album was also released in 1970, and was another gold disc recipient.[4] Survival and E Pluribus Funk were both released in 1971. E Pluribus Funk celebrated the Shea Stadium show with an embossed depiction of the stadium on the album cover's reverse.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy late 1971, the band was concerned with Knight's managerial style and fiscal responsibility. This growing dissatisfaction led Grand Funk Railroad to fire Knight in early 1972. Knight sued for breach of contract, which resulted in a protracted legal battle. At one point, Knight repossessed the band's gear before a gig at Madison Square Garden. In VH1's Behind the Music Grand Funk Railroad episode, Knight stated that the original contract would have run out in about three months, and that the smart decision for the band would have been to just wait out the time.[7] However, at that moment, the band members felt they had no choice but to continue and fight for the rights to their careers and name.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1972, Grand Funk Railroad added Craig Frost on keyboards full-time. Originally, they had attempted to attract Peter Frampton, late of Humble Pie; however, Frampton was not available, due to signing a solo-record deal with A&M Records. The addition of Frost, however, was a stylistic shift from Grand Funk's original garage-band based rock and roll roots to a more rhythm and blues/pop rock-oriented style.  With the new lineup, Grand Funk released Phoenix, its sixth album of original music, in 1972.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo refine Grand Funk's sound, the band secured veteran musician Todd Rundgren as a producer. Their two most successful albums and two number-one hit singles resulted: the Don Brewer-penned \\"We're an American Band\\" (from We're an American Band) and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" (from Shinin' On, written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin and originally recorded by Little Eva).  The album We're an American Band topped out at number two  on the charts. \\"We're an American Band\\" was Grand Funk's first number-one  hit, followed by Brewer's number-19 hit \\"Walk Like a Man\\".  \\"The Loco-Motion\\" in 1974 was Grand Funk's second chart-topping single, followed by Brewer's number-11 hit \\"Shinin' On\\". The band continued touring the U.S., Europe, and Japan.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1974, Grand Funk re-engaged Jimmy Ienner as producer and reverted to using their full name: Grand Funk Railroad. The band released the album All the Girls in the World Beware!!!, which depicted the band members' heads superimposed on the bodies of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Franco Columbu. This album spawned the band's last two top-10 hits, \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\" and \\"Bad Time\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough they were highly successful in the mid-1970s, tensions mounted within the band due to personal issues, burn-out, and disputes over musical direction. Despite these issues, Grand Funk forged ahead. Needing two more albums to complete their record deal with Capitol, Grand Funk embarked on a major tour and decided to record a double live album, Caught in the Act.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe double album should have fulfilled the contract with Capitol; however, because it contained previously released material, Capitol requested an additional album to complete Grand Funk's contractual obligation. While pressures between the band members still existed, the members agreed to move forward and complete one more album for Capitol to avoid legalities similar to the ones that they endured with Terry Knight in 1972. The band recorded Born to Die and agreed not to release any information regarding their impending breakup in 1976.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Grand Funk found new life from interest by Frank Zappa in producing the band. Signing with MCA Records, the resulting album Good Singin', Good Playin' yielded little success. After this, Grand Funk Railroad decided once more to disband in 1976.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the breakup, Farner began a solo career and signed with Atlantic Records, which resulted in two albums: Mark Farner (1977) and No Frills (1978). Brewer, Schacher, and Frost remained intact and formed the band Flint. Flint released one album on Columbia Records; a second record was finished but never released. Grand Funk Railroad reunited in 1981 without Frost and with Dennis Bellinger replacing Schacher on bass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new line-up released two albums on Irving Azoff's Full Moon label, distributed by Warner Bros. Records. These releases included 1981's Grand Funk Lives and 1983's What's Funk?. Neither album achieved much critical acclaim; but the single \\"Queen Bee\\" was included in the film Heavy Metal and its soundtrack album. After they disbanded a second time in 1983, Farner continued as a solo performer and became a Christian recording artist and Brewer went on to tour with Bob Seger's Silver Bullet Band.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, Grand Funk Railroad's three original members once again reunited and played to 250,000 people in 14 shows during a three-month period. In 1997, the band played three sold-out Bosnian benefit concerts. These shows featured  a full symphony orchestra that was conducted by Paul Shaffer (from the David Letterman Late Show). The band released a live two-disc benefit CD called Bosnia recorded in Auburn Hills, Michigan. This recording also featured Peter Frampton, who joined the band on stage. In 1998, Farner left the band and returned to his solo career.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, Grand Funk Railroad was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this, two years passed before the two remaining members recruited some well-regarded players to reform the band. Lead vocalist Max Carl (of 38 Special), former Kiss lead guitarist Bruce Kulick, and keyboardist Tim Cashion (Bob Seger, Robert Palmer) completed the new lineup.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Funk Railroad continues to tour 40 shows a year and kicked off their \\"45 YEARS OF GRAND FUNK\\" tour on January 25, 2014.","input":"Who are the original members of grand funk railroad?"},{"output":"Twilight Bark","context":"Twilight Bark (sometimes, Twilight Barking and Barking Chain) refers to the often-noted behavior in domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) of exchanging barks or howls across long distances, typically in the quiet hours of early evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term 'Twilight Bark' was coined by author Dodie Smith for her 1956 children's book, The Hundred and One Dalmatians,[1] and the phenomenon figures prominently as a plot device in the book and in the 1961 animated Disney movie.

It was the first large scale use of air power in the Jammu and Kashmir region since the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitial infiltrations were noticed in Kargil in early May, 1999. Because of the extreme winter weather in Kashmir, it was common practice for the Indian and Pakistan Army to abandon forward posts and reoccupy them in the spring. That particular spring, the Pakistan Army started reoccupying the forward posts well before the scheduled time. In a preliminary step in their bid to capture Kashmir, they reoccupied not only their own posts, but also those that belonged to India.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the second week of May, an ambush on an Indian army patrol acting on a tip-off by a local shepherd in the Batalik sector led to the exposure of the infiltration. Initially with little knowledge of the nature or extent of the encroachment, the Indian troops in the area initially claimed that they would evict them within a few days. However, soon reports of infiltration elsewhere along the LoC made it clear that the entire plan of attack was on a much bigger scale. India responded with Operation Vijay, a mobilisation of 200,000 Indian troops. However, because of the nature of the terrain, division and corps operations could not be mounted; the scale of most fighting was at the regimental or battalion level. In effect, two divisions of the Indian Army,[1] numbering 20,000, along with several thousand from the Paramilitary forces of India and the air force were deployed in the conflict zone.\\r\\nthe Indian Army moved into the region in full force. Soon, the intruders were found to be well entrenched and while artillery attacks had produced results in certain areas, more remote ones needed the help of the air force.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian Air Force (IAF) first tried to provide air support on 26 May, with the use of helicopters and MIGs flown by Squadron Leader Ajay Ahuja and his second in command Flt It Nachiketa. Ahuja was killed during the mission, and Nachiketa captured. On 29 May the IAF launched Canberra on a reconnaissance mission, flown by Wg Cdr CH Kulkarni, Sqn Ldr A Perumal and Sqn Ldr UK Jha, which was hit by ground fire. The plane returned to base on one engine, and the crew safely landed. On 30 May, the Cabinet Committee on Security authorized the IAF to mount attacks on the infiltrators without crossing the LoC. Initial indications from the government to the IAF was to operate only Attack helicopters. However, the Chief of Air Staff put forth the argument that in order to create a suitable environment for the helicopters, fighter action was required. On 30 May, the go-ahead was given and the IAF started its strike role. Flying from the Indian airfields of Srinagar, Avantipur and Adampur, ground attack aircraft MiG-21s, MiG-23s, MiG-27s, Jaguars and the Mirage 2000 struck insurgent positions. Of note, although the MiG-21 is built mainly for air interception with a secondary role of ground attack, it is capable of operating in restricted spaces which was of importance in the Kargil terrain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first strikes were launched on the 26 May, when the Indian Air Force struck infiltrator positions with fighter aircraft and helicopter gunships.[2] The initial strikes saw MiG-27s carrying out offensive sorties, with MiG-21s and (later) MiG-29s providing fighter cover. Mil Mi-17 gunships were also deployed in the Tololing sector.[3] Srinagar Airport was at this time closed to civilian air-traffic and dedicated to the Indian Air Force.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, on 27 May, the first fatalities were suffered when a MiG-21 was shot down by Pakistan Army over Batalik sector, while a MiG-27 crashed due to engine flame-out.[4][5] The following day, a Mi-17 was lost- with the loss of all four of the crew- when it was hit by  three Stinger missiles while on an offensive sortie.[3] These losses forced the Indian Air Force to reassess its strategy. The helicopters were immediately withdrawn from offensive roles as a measure against the man-portable missiles in possession of the infiltrators.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 May, the Indian Air Force called into operation the Mirage 2000 which was deemed the best aircraft capable of optimum performance under the conditions of high-altitude seen in the zone of conflict. Armed initially with 250?kg \\"dumb\\" bombs, No. 7 Squadron led by Wg Cdr Sandeep Chabra over three days, struck infiltrator positions in Muntho Dhalo, Tiger Hill and Point 4388 in the Drass Sector. The strikes on Muntho Dhalo on 17 June also destroyed logistics and re-supply capabilities of the infiltrators in the Batalik Sector.[3][not in citation given][citation needed] Through the last weeks of June, the Mirages, armed with LGBs as well as with \\"dumbs\\", repeatedly struck the heavily defended Tiger Hill. The first of these missions were observed by the (then) Chief of Air Staff, ACM AY Tipnis[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe choppers used were Mi-8 and the Mi-17. The transport planes were Avro, An-32 and IL-76. On May 27, the IAF had sent a MiG-27 on a photo reconnaissance mission over the Indian side of the Line of Control in Kashmir. Piloted by Flt Lt K Nachiketa, he ejected from his MiG-27 after an engine flameout due to gun gas ingestion. Squadron Leader Ajay Ahuja, who was in his MiG-21 tried to trace the downed MiG despite a blatant threat in the form of enemy Anti-Aircraft Guns. Within minutes his plane was shot at by a Stinger shoulder fired missile. Having crashed, it is believed by the Indian military that he survived the crash but was killed by Pakistan Army soldiers or irregulars. The body of Ahuja bore two point-blank bullet wounds as per the postmortem done by the Indian authorities. The point-blank injuries clearly indicate the intent of the enemy and a treatment in violation of Geneva conventions. Flt Lt Nachiketa was later paraded on Pakistan TV, this prompted India to accuse Pakistan of violating the Geneva convention on the treatment of Prisoners of War.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day the air force lost an Mi-17 Helicopter to a shoulder fired missile near Tololing, killing the crew of four. This resulted in a change in strategy and technology. With the Israelis providing around 100 Laser-guided bomb kits to the Indian Military, the air force chose to make maximum use of this and retaliated with regular sorties on Pakistani occupied bunkers. The aircraft operated at 10,000 meters AGL (33,000 feet above sea level), well out of MANPADs range, leading to a drop in the accuracy rate of the bombs. The low number of airstrips for take off and landing of the flights also constrained the efficiency of the attacks. Despite this, there were hundreds of sorties on the intruders with no further material or personnel casualties enabling a gradual takeover of the mountain posts by Indian troops. According to IAF the \\"air strikes against the Pakistani infiltrators, supply camps and other targets yielded rich dividends.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy July all the remaining intruders had withdrawn and the operation was ended, being declared a success by the IAF in having achieved its primary objectives. However, there has also been criticism of the methods initially used and the type of planes being unsuitable to the terrain that resulted in early losses. [1] This is believed by many in the air force as coming as a wake up call to upgrade the aging fleet of craft (especially the attack aircraft and helicopters) to better enable them to fight in the mountainous region. But, in the context of the war and in light of the poor information available on the infiltrations, the Indian Air Force was able to coordinate well with the Army and provide air support to the recapture of most the posts before Pakistan decided to withdraw its remaining troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lessons learned in this limited war influenced India to urgently upgrade its combat fleet. It acquired and later started co-developing Sukhoi Su-30MKI heavy fighters with Russia beginning in the early 2000s. The process of acquiring 126 Medium Multi-role Combat Aircraft was also initiated in 2001, India's largest military tender to date. Dassault Rafale was declared the winner in January 2012.","input":"What was the iaf operation in 1999 codenamed?"},{"output":"20 September 1993","context":"The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, commonly known by its abbreviation PSLV, is an expendable launch system developed and operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It was developed to allow India to launch its Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites into Sun-synchronous orbits, a service that was, until the advent of the PSLV, commercially available only from Russia. PSLV can also launch small size satellites into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).[6]\\r\\nIn 2015 India successfully launched 17 foreign satellites belonging to Canada, Indonesia, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. Some notable payloads launched by PSLV include India's first lunar probe Chandrayaan-1, India's first interplanetary mission, Mangalyaan (Mars orbiter) and India's first space observatory, Astrosat.[1]\\r\\nOn 15 February 2017, India successfully launched a payload of 104 foreign satellites in polar orbit around the Earth using PSLV tripling the previous record held by Russia for most number of satellites sent to space in a single launch.Now pslv is readily launching in this month[when?] again with some satellites in half of december[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPSLV was designed and developed in the early 1990s at Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre near Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. The inertial navigation systems are developed by ISRO Inertial Systems Unit (IISU) at Thiruvananthapuram. The liquid propulsion stages for the second and fourth stages of PSLV as well as the reaction control systems are developed by the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) at Mahendragiri near Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu. The solid propellant motors are processed at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SHAR)at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh which also carries out launch operations.\\r\\nThe PSLV was first launched on 20 September 1993. The first and second stages performed as expected, but an attitude control problem led to the collision of the second and third stages at separation, and the payload failed to reach orbit.[9] After this initial setback, the PSLV successfully completed its second mission in 1994.[10] The fourth launch of PSLV suffered a partial failure in 1997, leaving its payload in a lower than planned orbit. Since then, the PSLV has launched 34 times with no further failures.[11]\\r\\nPSLV continues to support Indian and foreign satellite launches especially for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. It has undergone several improvements with each subsequent version, especially those involving thrust, efficiency as well as weight. In November 2013, it was used to launch the Mars Orbiter Mission, India's first interplanetary probe.[12]\\r\\nISRO is planning to privatise the operations of PSLV and will work through a joint venture with private industries. The integration and launch will be managed an industrial consortium through Antrix Corporation.[13]\\r\\nThe PSLV has four stages using solid and liquid propulsion systems alternately. The first stage, one of the largest solid rocket boosters in the world, carries 138 tonnes of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene-bound (HTPB) propellant and develops a maximum thrust of about 4,800?kN. The 2.8-m diameter motor case is made of maraging steel and has an empty mass of 30,200?kg.[5] Pitch and yaw control during first stage flight is provided by the Secondary Injection Thrust Vector Control System (SITVC), which injects an aqueous solution of strontium perchlorate into the nozzle to produce asymmetric thrust. The solution is stored in two cylindrical aluminium tanks strapped to the solid rocket motor and pressurised with nitrogen. Roll control is provided by two small liquid engines on opposite sides of the stage, the Roll Control Thrusters (RCT).\\r\\nOn the PSLV and PSLV-XL, first stage thrust is augmented by six strap-on solid boosters. Four boosters are ground-lit and the remaining two ignite 25 seconds after launch. In the standard PSLV, each booster carries nine tonnes of propellant and produces 510?kN thrust. The PSLV-XL uses larger boosters which carry 12 tonnes of propellant and produce 719?kN thrust. Two strap-on boosters are equipped with SITVC for additional attitude control.[5] The PSLV-CA uses no strap-on boosters.\\r\\nThe second stage employs the Vikas engine and carries 41.5 tonnes (40 tonnes till C-5 mission) of liquid propellant?ÿ unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) as fuel and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) as oxidiser. It generates a maximum thrust of 800?kN (724 till C-5 mission). The engine is hydraulically gimbaled (I4) to provide pitch and yaw control, while roll control is provided by two hot gas reaction control motors.\\r\\nThe third stage uses 7 tonnes of HTPB-based solid propellant and produces a maximum thrust of 240?kN. It has a Kevlar-polyamide fibre case and a submerged nozzle equipped with a flex-bearing-seal gimbaled nozzle (I2) thrust vector engine for pitch & yaw control. Roll control is provided by the fourth stage reaction control system (RCS).[5]\\r\\nThe fourth stage is powered by twin engines burning monomethylhydrazine (MMH) and mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON). Each engine generates 7.4?kN thrust and is gimbaled (I3) to provide pitch, yaw & roll control during powered flight. Coast phase attitude control is provided by RCS. The stage carries 2,500?kg of propellant in the PSLV and PSLV-XL and 2,100?kg in the PSLV-CA.[14]\\r\\nPSLV is developed with a group of wide-range control units.\\r\\nISRO has envisaged a number of variants of PSLV to cater to different mission requirements. There are currently three operational versions of the PSLV  the standard (PSLV), the core-alone (PSLV-CA) without the six strap-on booster motors, and the (PSLV-XL) version, which carries more solid fuel in its strap-on motors than the standard version.[15] These configurations provide wide variations in payload capabilities ranging from 3800?kg in LEO to 1800?kg in Sun-synchronous orbit.\\r\\nThe standard version of the PSLV (PSLV-G) has four stages using solid and liquid propulsion systems alternately and six strap-on boosters. It currently has capability to launch 1,678?kg to 622?km into Sun-synchronous orbit.\\r\\nThe PSLV-CA, CA meaning \\"Core Alone\\", model premiered on 23 April 2007. The CA model does not include the six strap-on boosters used by the PSLV standard variant. Two small roll control modules and two first-stage motor control injection tanks were still attached to the side of the first stage.[14] The fourth stage of the CA variant has 400?kg less propellant when compared to its standard version.[14] It currently has capability to launch 1,100?kg to 622?km Sun synchronous orbit.[16]\\r\\nPSLV-XL is the upgraded version of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle in its standard configuration boosted by more powerful, stretched strap-on boosters.[14] Weighing 320 tonnes at lift-off, the vehicle uses larger strap-on motors (PSOM-XL) to achieve higher payload capability. PSOM-XL uses larger 1-metre diameter, 13.5m length motors, and carries 12 tonnes of solid propellants instead of 9 tonnes used in the earlier configuration of PSLV.[17] On 29 December 2005, ISRO successfully tested the improved version of strap-on booster for the PSLV. The first version of PSLV-XL was the launch of Chandrayaan-1 by PSLV C11. The payload capability for this variant is 1800?kg compared to 1600?kg for the other variants.[16] Other launches include the RISAT (Radar Imaging Satellite) and GSAT-12.[18]\\r\\nISRO is also considering the development of a three-stage version of the rocket without six strap-on boosters (with the second stage of the four-stage version removed) which will be capable of placing 500?kg to LEO.[16][19][20]\\r\\nAs of 31 August 2017[update] the PSLV has made 41 launches, with 38 successfully reaching their planned orbits, two outright failures and one partial failure, yielding a success rate of 7001930000000000000?93% (or 7001950000000000000?95% including the partial failure).[21] All launches have occurred from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), known before 2002 as the Sriharikota Range (SHAR).\\r\\nMaiden flight; attitude control failure at second stage separation.[22]\\r\\n[23]\\r\\n[24]\\r\\nFirst operational flight; fourth stage under-performed resulting in lower than planned orbit.

Even though the mission was a failure, the launch team and an expert committee appointed thereafter noted that the mission had validated many technologies and that most sub-systems had performed optimally.[151][152]\\r\\nThis was the second flight of PSLV program which was also its first successful flight. The vehicle carried IRS-P2 satellite which was deployed in the Sun-synchronous Low Earth orbit.\\r\\nThis was the third launch of PSLV program which was also its second successful launch. The vehicle carried IRS-P3 satellite which was deployed in the Sun-synchronous Low Earth orbit.\\r\\nThe launch was witnessed by the former Prime Minister I.K. Gujral and also marked India's first launch vehicle built without Russian assistance.[153][154]\\r\\nIn the flight sequence, IRS-P4 was injected first, followed by KITSAT-3 and DLR-Tubsat in that order.[26] The mission was supported by ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command network of ground stations located at Bangalore, Sriharikota, Lucknow, Mauritius, Bearslake, Russia and Biak, Indonesia. During the initial phase of the mission the ground station at Wilhem in Germany also provided network support. Upon injection of the satellites, data from the IRS-P4 was received at Hyderabad while KITSAT-3 data was received at the ground station in South Korea and the data from the DLR-Tubsat was received at the university ground station in Berlin.[27][155]\\r\\nPSLV-C3 was the third operational launch and overall sixth mission of the PSLV program. This launch was also the forty-sixth launch by Indian Space Research Organisation since its first mission on 1 January 1962. The vehicle carried three satellites which were deployed in the Sun-synchronous Low Earth orbit.[156][157]\\r\\nPSLV-C4 was the fourth operational launch and overall seventh mission of the PSLV program. This launch was also the forty-eight launch by Indian Space Research Organisation since its first mission on 1 January 1962. The vehicle carried and injected India's first dedicated Meteorological satellite, Kalpana-1 (originally called METSAT) into the Geosynchronous transfer orbit. PSLV-C4 was launched at 15:53 hours IST on 12 September 2002 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (then called \\"Sriharikota Launching Range\\").[158][159]\\r\\nPSLV-C5 was the fifth operational launch and overall eighth mission of the PSLV program. This launch was also the fifty-second launch by Indian Space Research Organisation since its first mission. The vehicle carried and injected India's remote sensing satellite, Resourcesat-1 (a.k.a. IRS-P6) into the Sun-synchronous orbit. PSLV-C5 was launched at 04:52 hours Coordinated Universal Time (10:22 Indian Standard Time) on 17 October 2003 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre.[160]\\r\\nThe former President, Dr. Abdul Kalam, witnessed the launch from the Mission Control Centre.[161] It was the first PSLV launch from second pad, using integrate-transfer-and-launch technology. After its integration in the Vehicle Assembly Building, the PSLV-C6 was transported on rails to the Umbilical Tower (UT) located one km away using the Mobile Launch Pedestal where the final operations were carried out.[161]\\r\\nThe following hardware changes[162][163] were made since PSLV-C6:\\r\\nThe fourth stage first fired Cartosat-2A into orbit at an altitude of 637?km about 885 seconds after lift-off. About 45 seconds later, it propelled IMS-1 into the orbit. Then the six nano satellites belonging to a cluster called Nanosatellite Launch System-4 (NLS-4) were injected into orbit at intervals of 20 seconds each. NLS-5, a single satellite, flew out and finally the tenth satellite Rubin-8 went along with the fourth stage into orbit. Two satellites belonged to India and the remaining were nanosatellites built by universities in different countries.[164] This was the maximum number of satellites placed in orbit, in a single PSLV launch.[165][166][167]\\r\\nLaunch attended by the former Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh.[168] mRESINS (mini Redundant Strapdown Inertial Navigation System) bolted to the vehicle's fourth stage, have tested avionics for future PSLV missions.[169] With this launch Indian Space Research Organisation marked its 100 space missions, with 62 satellites, 37 launch vehicles and 1 Space Capsule Recovery Experiment.\\r\\nEarlier launch date for PSLV C22 was fixed as 12 June 2013 (1.01AM) but the launch had been postponed because of a technical snag in the 2nd stage.[170]\\r\\nThe launch of the first satellite in the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), scheduled for 12 June 2013 from Sriharikota, has been postponed by 14 days after an anomaly was discovered just 11 days before launch. The satellite IRNSS-1A, which would be the first in a series of seven navigation satellites was scheduled to be launched on board the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) C22 at 1.01 am on 12 June. The satellite has undergone its pre-launch checks successfully. However, ISRO said the launch vehicle had an anomaly in one Electro-hydraulic actuators. \\"During the electrical checks of the launch vehicle, an anomaly was observed in one of the electro-hydraulic control actuators in the second stage. It has been decided to replace this actuator,\\" a statement by ISRO said. Officials added that the replacement of the actuator would take two weeks and it would be carried out at the launch pad and vehicle assembly area.\\r\\nISRO then replaced a faulty component in the PSLV C22 rocket and rescheduled the flight of the IRNSS-1A satellite on it for 11:41?p.m. on 1 July 2013.[171] PSLV C22, successfully launched IRNSS-1A, the first satellite in the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS).\\r\\nAt the completion of the countdown, PSLV C22 lifted off from the First Launch Pad at 23:41 hrs (IST) on 1 July 2013 with the ignition of the first stage and four strap-on motors of the launch vehicle.[71]\\r\\nThe Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), informally called Mangalyaan is a Mars orbiter that was successfully injected into Earth orbit on 5 November 2013 at 2:38 PM IST (9:08 UTC) atop a PSLV-XL launch vehicle from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota (SHAR).\\r\\nPSLV C29 lifted off from the First Launch Pad (FLP) of SDSC SHAR at 18:00 hrs [IST] on 16 December 2015. It successfully deployed six satellites it carried with gross weight of 624?kg. After fourth stage engines were cut off primary payload TeLEOS-1 was injected in orbit at about 18 min 12 seconds after lift-off. This was followed by the deployment of other five satellites, namely Kent Ridge-1, VELOX-C1, VELOX-II, Galassia and Athenoxat-1 in quick succession in the subsequent three minutes.[172] 67 minutes into flight fourth stage re-ignition capability was demonstrated successfully by firing its engines for duration of nearly five seconds. This capability would enable multiple satellite deployment in varying orbits on same flight.[86]\\r\\nPSLV-C34 was launched on 22 June 2016 and successfully deployed 20 satellites in Sun-synchronous orbit. A Dual Launch Adapter with new design[173] compared to its previous version[174] was used to integrate all ride-sharing payloads with PS4. After completion of mission a pair of PS4 re-ignition tests were performed to reaffirm multi-orbit deployment capability of PS4.[175] A new Inertial navigation system 'Mk IV A' employing next generation Accelerometer was introduced on this mission.[176][177]\\r\\nRemote umbilical fill and drain system was used on fourth stage for the first time reducing the countdown time by one day. Experimental avionics packages were flown bolted to fourth stage including 'miniaturized advanced inertial navigation system' miniAINS, NavIC based positioning system, Vikram processor and new lithium-ion based power system. A video imaging system was also on-board, consisting of five cameras which captured and live streamed various staging events.[178][179]\\r\\nPSLV C37 was launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota (SHAR) carrying a payload of 104 satellites from 6 countries around the world (Israel, Kazakhstan, The Netherlands, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and the United States). Of the 104 satellites, 96 were CubeSats made by Planet Labs and Spire Global, two San Francisco companies adding to their commercial satellite constellations.[180]\\r\\nThe launch set the record for the largest number of spacecraft ever launched on a single rocket. The previous record was held by Russia, which in 2014 catapulted 37 satellites in a single launch, using a modified inter-continental ballistic missile.[8]\\r\\nOn 20 September 1993 a PSLV D1, the first developmental flight rocket, failed during launch. A significant attitude disturbance occurred during second to third-stage separation, causing the attitude control command to exceed its maximum value. Because of the programming error in the pitch control loop of the digital autopilot software in the guidance and control processor, the required reversal of command polarity did not take place, causing the pitch loop to become unstable, resulted in loss of attitude control and failure to achieve orbit. The attitude control disturbance was traced to failure of one of the retro rockets designed to pull the burnt second stage away from the third stage. The vehicle crashed into the Bay of Bengal 700 seconds after take off.[152]\\r\\nOn 29 September 1997 a PSLV C1 rocket failed during launch. Anomalous interaction between the primary and secondary pressure regulators of the fourth stage caused a reduction in propellant flow and thrust after 250 seconds of burn time. As a result, the fourth stage was shut down by a software override timer after burning 435 seconds, before reaching the target orbit or depleting propellant. The injection velocity was 140?m/s low, resulting in an orbit of 301 x 823?km instead of the planned 817?km circular SSO.[181] Initially, a leak of helium gas from one of the components in the fourth stage was suspected,[153][182] similar to recent Long March 3 launch failure, but later ruled out. Resulting orbit was partially corrected using satellite's on-board thrusters, thereby raising the perigee to 737?km, while the apogee remained at 821?km.[152]\\r\\nPSLV-C39 carrying IRNSS-1H was launched on 31 August 2017 at 1330 UTC from Second Launch Pad of Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SHAR). After about 203 seconds of flight payload fairing failed to be jettisoned as planned. Despite completing rest of the flight with all other systems working as expected, with about 1000 kg of extra weight[183] orbit achieved was 6554.8 x 167.4 km at 19.18 inclination well below the intended 284 x 20650 km at 19.2 inclination.[184] After fourth stage engine cut off IRNSS-1H separation occurred, leaving it adrift inside the closed payload fairing. This was second event of total failure in PSLV launch history.","input":"When was pslv launched for the first time?"},{"output":"26 June 1997","context":"","input":"When was harry potter first published in the united states?"},{"output":"the Methodist chapel that stood on the northwest corner of SR 54 and Boyette Road","context":"Wesley Chapel is an unincorporated census-designated place in Pasco County, Florida, United States.

Each term consists of alternating periods of approximately two weeks known as \\"sittings\\" and \\"recesses.\\" Justices hear cases and deliver rulings during sittings; they discuss cases and write opinions during recesses.\\r\\nIn nearly all of the cases heard by the Supreme Court, the Court exercises the appellate jurisdiction granted it by Article III of the Constitution. This authority permits the Court to reviewand affirm or overturndecisions made by lower courts and tribunals. Procedures for bringing cases before the Supreme Court have changed significantly over time. Today, cases are brought before the Supreme Court by one of several methods, of which the first two account for the overwhelming majority of cases decided:\\r\\nCertain cases that have not been considered by a lower court may be heard by the Supreme Court in the first instance under what is termed original jurisdiction. The Supreme Court's authority in this respect is also derived from Article III of the Constitution, which states that the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction \\"in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party.\\" The original jurisdiction of the Court is set forth in 28 U.S.C.??1251. This statute provides further that, in the case of disputes between two or more states, the Supreme Court holds both original and exclusive jurisdiction and no lower court may hear such cases.\\r\\nThe number of original jurisdiction cases heard by the court is small; generally only one or two such cases are heard per term. Because the nine-member Supreme Court is not well-suited to conducting pretrial proceedings or trials, original jurisdiction cases accepted by the Court are typically referred to a well-qualified lawyer or lower-court judge to serve as special master, conduct the proceedings, and report recommendations to the Court. The Court then considers whether to accept the special master's report or whether to sustain any exceptions filed to the report.\\r\\nAlthough jury trials are in theory possible in the Court's original jurisdiction cases, there has not been one since Georgia v. Brailsford in 1794.[1] In 1950, in the case United States v. Louisiana, the state of Louisiana moved for a jury trial, but the Court denied the motion, ruling that the suit was an equity action and not an action at law, and that therefore the Seventh Amendment guarantee of a jury trial did not apply. If a matter involving an action at law did come before the court, however, a jury would likely be empaneled and would hear the case alongside the justices of the Court.[2]\\r\\nSince the Judiciary Act of 1925 (\\"The Certiorari Act\\" in some texts), the majority of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction has been discretionary.[3] Each year, the court receives approximately 9,000ÿ10,000 petitions for certiorari, of which less than 1% (approximately 80ÿ100), are granted plenary review with oral arguments, and an additional 50 to 60 are disposed of without plenary review.[4][5]\\r\\nThe Court strictly enforces its requirements for the preparation and timely filing of certiorari petitions, in order to manage such a massive caseload. This occasionally results in harsh consequences, as Justice Thomas acknowledged in a 2007 opinion: \\"Just a few months ago, the Clerk, pursuant to this Courts Rule 13.2, refused to accept a petition for certiorari submitted by Ryan Heath Dickson because it had been filed one day late ... Dickson was executed on April 26, 2007, without any Member of this Court having even seen his petition for certiorari. The rejected certiorari petition was Dicksons first in this Court, and one can only speculate as to whether denial of that petition would have been a foregone conclusion.\\"[6]\\r\\nIn theory, each Justice's clerks write a brief for the Justice outlining the questions presented, and offering a recommendation as to whether certiorari should be granted; in practice, most Justices (all of the current court, except Justices Alito and Gorsuch) have their clerks participate in the cert pool.[7][8][9]\\r\\nDuring the Justices' regular conference, the Justices discuss the petitions, and grant certiorari in less than five percent of the cases filed. (During the 1980s and 1990s, the number of cases accepted and decided each term approached 150 per year; more recently, the number of cases granted has averaged well under 100 annually). Before each conference, the Chief Justice prepares a list of those petitions he believes have sufficient merit to warrant discussion. Any other Justice may also add a case to the \\"discuss list\\"; cases not designated for discussion by any Justice are automatically denied review. The Court or a Justice may also decide that a case be \\"re-listed\\" for discussion at a later conference; this occurs, for example, where the Court decides to request input from the Solicitor General of the United States on whether a petition should be granted.[10]\\r\\nThe votes of four Justices at Conference (see Rule of four) will suffice to grant certiorari and place the case on the court's calendar. If the Supreme Court grants certiorari (or the certified question or other extraordinary writ), then a briefing schedule is arranged for the parties to submit their briefs in favor of or against a particular form of relief. During this time, an individual or group having an interest in a case but not a party to the case may submit a motion to appear before the court as amicus curiae (\\"friend of the court\\"). Except for certain specific categories (such as lawyers for state and local governments) or where all parties to the case consent, it is in the Court's discretion whether such motions are granted.\\r\\nThe grant or denial of certiorari petitions by the Court are usually issued as one-sentence orders without explanation.\\r\\nCases that fall within the Court's original jurisdiction are initiated by filing a complaint directly with the Supreme Court, and normally are assigned to a special master appointed by the Court for the taking of evidence and making recommendations, after which the Court may accept briefs and hear oral arguments as in an appellate case.\\r\\nBefore oral arguments, the parties to a case file legal briefs outlining their arguments. An amicus curiae may also submit a brief in support of a particular outcome in the case if the Court grants it permission. Formal rules govern every aspect of these briefs; Chief Justice William Rehnquist described the rules thus:\\r\\nThereafter, if the Court chooses to hold a hearing, each side has thirty minutes to present its case orally. In exceptional and controversial cases, however, the time limit may be extended. In the Court's early years, attorneys might argue a single case for hours or even days; but as the judicial workload increased, the time available for argument has been restricted. The late Chief Justice Rehnquist was noted for his especially strict enforcement of the argument time limits.\\r\\nTo file pleadings or to argue a case, an attorney must be a member of the bar of the Court. (The primary requirement for admission to the Bar is that the attorney must have been admitted to practice in the highest court of a state or territory for at least the past three years.) Justices are allowed to interrupt the attorney speaking in order to ask him or her questions, and particularly since the arrival of Justice Antonin Scalia in 1986, do so often.[12]\\r\\nThe Court began recording Oral Arguments in October 1955.[13] Beginning in October 2010, the Supreme Court began the practice of posting recordings and transcripts of the oral arguments made during the preceding week on Fridays on the Court's website.\\r\\nIn an interview for C-SPAN, former Justice Scalia, speaking for himself, noted that by the time the Justices hear oral arguments, having read the submissions by the parties and amici, it is \\"very rare, though not unheard of\\", for the discussion during the oral arguments to change his view of a case in which he has already made up his mind based on the submissions and his research about the case. However, he also made the point that it is \\"quite common\\" for him to go into Oral Arguments with his mind not made up yet, as the cases are usually very hard and difficult, and that in those situations a persuasive attorney can make the difference for him.[14]\\r\\nAt the end of a week in which the Court has heard oral arguments, the Justices hold a conference to discuss the cases and vote on any new petitions of certiorari. The Justices discuss the points of law at issue in the cases. No clerks are permitted to be present, which would make it exceedingly difficult for a justice without a firm grasp of the matters at hand to participate.[15] At this conference, each justicein order from most to least seniorstates the basis on which he or she would decide the case, and a preliminary vote is taken.\\r\\nFormer Justice Scalia professed frustration that there is little substantive discussion,[16] while former Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote that this makes the conference more efficient.[17] The votes are tallied, and the responsibility for writing the opinion in the case is assigned to one of the justices; the most senior Justice voting in the majority (but always the Chief Justice if he is in the majority) makes the assignment, and can assign the responsibility to him- or herself.\\r\\nThe justice writing the opinion for the court will produce and circulate a draft opinion to the other justices. Each justice's law clerks may be involved in this phase. In modern Supreme Court history only a few justices, such as former Justice Antonin Scalia, have regularly written their own first drafts.[18] Once the draft opinion has been reviewed, the remaining Justices may recommend changes to the opinion. Whether these changes are accommodated depends on the legal philosophy of the drafters as well as on how strong a majority the opinion garnered at conference. A justice may instead simply join the opinion at that point without comment.\\r\\nVotes at conference are preliminary; while opinions are being circulated, it is not unheard of for a justice to change sides. A justice may be swayed by the persuasiveness (or lack thereof) of the opinion or dissent, or as a result of reflection and discussion on the points of law at issue.\\r\\nThe evolution of the justices' views during the circulation of draft opinions can change the outcome of the case; an opinion that begins as a majority opinion can become a dissenting opinion, and vice versa. At the conference for Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Justice Kennedy is said to have initially voted with Chief Justice Rehnquist, but then changed his mind, feeling unable to join Rehnquist's draft opinion.[19] While working for the Justice Department, present-day Chief Justice John Robertsa former Rehnquist law clerkwrote an analysis of Wallace v. Jaffree[20] in which he indicated his belief (based on the length and structure) that Rehnquist's dissent had started out as an opinion for the court, but lost its majority; similar speculation is often heard of Justice O'Connor's dissent in Kelo v. New London.[21] Justice Kennedy is known within the Court for changing his mind subsequent to the conference, and Justice Thomas is known for having the tendency to lose a majority.[22] Justices may change sides at any time prior to the handing down of the Court's opinion. Generally, the Court's decision is the opinion which a majority (five or more) of justices have joined. In rare instances, the Court will issue a plurality opinion in which four or fewer Justices agree on one opinion, but the others are so fractured that they cannot agree on a position. In this circumstance, in order to determine what the decision is lawyers and judges will analyze the opinions to determine on which points a majority agrees. An example of a case decided by a plurality opinion is Hamdi v. Rumsfeld.\\r\\nA justice voting with the majority may write a concurring opinion; this is an opinion where the justice agrees with the majority holding itself, but where he or she wishes to express views on the legal elements of the case that are not encompassed in the majority opinion. Justices who do not agree with the decision made by the majority may also submit dissenting opinions, which may give alternative legal viewpoints. Dissenting opinions carry no legal weight or precedent, but they can set the argument for future cases. John Marshall Harlan's dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson set down for the majority opinion later in Brown v. Board of Education.\\r\\nAfter granting a writ of certiorari and accepting a case for review, the justices may decide against further review of the case. For example, the Court may feel the case presented during oral arguments did not present the constitutional issues in a clear-cut way, and that adjudication of these issues is better deferred until a suitable case comes before the court. In this event the writ of certiorari is \\"dismissed as improvidently granted\\" (DIG)saying, in effect that the Court should not have accepted the case. As with the granting or denial of cert, this dismissal is customarily made using a simple per curiam decision without explanation.[23]\\r\\nCustomarily, justices who were not seated at the time oral arguments were heard by the Supreme Court do not participate in the formulation of an opinion. Likewise, a justice leaving the Court prior to the handing down of an opinion does not take part in the Court's opinion. Should the composition of the Court materially affect the outcome of a pending case, the justices will likely elect to reschedule the case for rehearing.\\r\\nIf not all of the nine justices vote on a case, or the Court has a vacancy, then a tied vote is possible. If this occurs, then the decision of the court below is affirmed, but the case is not considered to be binding precedent. The effect is a return to the status quo ante. No opinions (or voting alignments) are issued in such a case, only the one-sentence announcement that \\"[t]he judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court.\\" Omega S.A. v. Costco Wholesale Corp. is an example of such a case. The court tries to avoid such rulings when possible: After the retirement of Justice O'Connor in 2006 three cases would have ended with a tie. All cases were reargued to allow the newly appointed Samuel Alito to cast a decisive vote.\\r\\nA quorum of justices to hear and decide a case is six. If, through recusals or vacancies, fewer than six justices can participate in a case, and a majority of qualified justices determines that the case cannot be heard in the next term, then the decision of the court below is affirmed as if the Court had been equally divided on the case. An exception exists when this situation arises in one of the now-rare cases brought directly to the Supreme Court on appeal from a United States District Court; in this situation, the case is referred to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the corresponding circuit for a final decision there by either the Court of Appeals sitting en banc, or a panel consisting of the three most senior active circuit judges.[24]\\r\\nThroughout the term, but mostly during the last months of the termMay, June, and, if necessary, Julythe Court announces its opinions. The decision of the Court is subsequently published, first as a slip opinion, and subsequently in the United States Reports. In recent years, opinions have been available on the Supreme Court's website and other legal websites on the morning they are announced. Since recording devices have been banned inside the courtroom, the fastest way for decisions of landmark cases to reach the press is through the Running of the Interns.[25]\\r\\nThe opinion of the Court is usually signed by the author; occasionally, the Supreme Court may issue an unsigned opinion per curiam. The practice of issuing a single opinion of the Court was initiated during the tenure of Chief Justice John Marshall during the early 19th century. This custom replaced the previous practice under which each Justice, whether in the majority or the minority, issued a separate opinion. The older practice is still followed by appellate courts in many common law jurisdictions outside the United States.\\r\\nSupreme Court decisions are typically cited as in the following example: \\"Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).\\" The court citation consists of the names of the opposing parties; the volume number; \\"U.S.\\" (signifying United States Reports, the official reporter of Supreme Court decisions); the page number on which the decision begins; and the year in which the case was decided. The names of the opposing parties are listed in the format \\"Petitioner v. Respondent\\" or \\"Appellant v. Appellee.\\" The Reporter of Decisions is responsible for publication of the Court's rulings. Two other widely used citation formats exist: the Supreme Court Reporter and the Lawyers' Edition, corresponding to two privately published collections of decisions. Citations to cases in the Supreme Court Reporter would be structured as follows: Snowden v. Hughes, 64 S. Ct. 397 (1944). Citations to cases in the Lawyers' Edition would be as follows: Snowden v. Hughes, 88 L. Ed. 497 (1944). Judicial opinions often use the citation from all three sources (the United States Reports, Supreme Court Reporter, and Lawyers' Edition), as seen here: Martin v. Texas, 200 U.S. 316, 26 S. Ct. 338, 50 L. Ed. 497 (1906). Since the 1930s, prior to publication of the decisions in these reporters, they are available from the United States Law Week (U.S.L.W.). In more recent years, opinions have been available electronically soon after they appeared on commercial sites such as Lexis or Westlaw, on Internet sites such as FindLaw and on the Court's own website.[26]\\r\\nThe Reporter of Decisions is the court official responsible for the publication of the Court's opinions and orders. The current Reporter of Decisions is Christine Luchok Fallon.\\r\\nDecisions of the Supreme Court are precedents that bind all lower courts, both federal and state. The Supreme Court generally respects its own precedents, but has in some cases overturned them.","input":"When presenting a case before the supreme court. approximately how long does each side have?"},{"output":"2,000 pounds","context":"The short ton is a unit of weight equal to 2,000 pounds (907.18474?kg).

Religious affiliations of United Kingdom citizens are recorded by regular surveys, the four major ones being the national decennial census, the Labour Force Survey, the British Social Attitudes survey and the European Social Survey. According to the 2011 Census, Christianity is the major religion, followed by Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism and Buddhism in terms of number of adherents. Among Christians, Anglicans are the most common denomination, followed by the Catholic Church in the United Kingdom. This, and the relatively large number of individuals with nominal or no religious affiliations, has led commentators to variously describe the United Kingdom as a multi-faith and secularised society.\\r\\nThe United Kingdom was formed by the union of previously independent countries in 1707, and consequently most of the largest religious groups do not have UK-wide organisational structures. While some groups have separate structures for the individual countries of the United Kingdom, others have a single structure covering England and Wales or Great Britain. Similarly, due to the relatively recent creation of Northern Ireland in 1921, most major religious groups in Northern Ireland are organised on an all-Ireland basis.\\r\\nWhile the United Kingdom as a whole lacks an official religion, the Church of England remains the state church of its largest constituent country, England. The Monarch of the United Kingdom is the Supreme Governor of the Church, and accordingly, only a Protestant may inherit the British throne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPre-Roman forms of religion in Britain included various forms of ancestor worship and paganism.[3] Little is known about the details of such religions (see British paganism). Forms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the United Kingdom for over 1,400 years. It was introduced by the Romans to what is now England, Wales, and Southern Scotland. The doctrine of Pelagianism, declared heretical in the Council of Carthage (418), originated with a British-born ascetic, Pelagius.\\r\\nThe Anglo-Saxon invasions briefly re-introduced paganism in the 5th and 6th centuries; Christianity was again brought to Great Britain by Catholic Church and Irish-Scottish missionaries in the course of the 7th century (see Anglo-Saxon Christianity).[4] Insular Christianity as it stood between the 6th and 8th centuries retained some idiosyncrasies in terms of liturgy and calendar, but it had been nominally united with Roman Christianity since at least the Synod of Whitby of 664. Still in the Anglo-Saxon period, the archbishops of Canterbury established a tradition of receiving their pallium from Rome to symbolize the authority of the Pope.\\r\\nThe Catholic Church remained the dominant form of Western Christianity in Britain throughout the Middle Ages, but the (Anglican) Church of England became the independent established church in England and Wales in 1534 as a result of the English Reformation.[5] It retains a representation in the UK Parliament and the British monarch is its Supreme Governor.[6]\\r\\nIn Scotland, the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, established in a separate Scottish Reformation in the sixteenth century, is recognized as the national church. It is not subject to state control and the British monarch is an ordinary member, required to swear an oath to \\"maintain and preserve the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Government\\" upon his or her accession.[7][8]\\r\\nThe adherence to the Catholic Church continued at various levels in different parts of Britain, especially among recusants and in the north of England,[9] but most strongly in Ireland. This would expand in Great Britain, partly due to Irish immigration in the nineteenth century,[10] the Catholic emancipation and the Restoration of the English hierarchy.\\r\\nParticularly from the mid-seventeenth century, forms of Protestant nonconformity, including Congregationalists, Baptists, Quakers and, later, Methodists, grew outside of the established church.[11] The (Anglican) Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920 and, as the (Anglican) Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1870 before the partition of Ireland, there is no established church in Northern Ireland.[12]\\r\\nThe Jews in England were expelled in 1290 and only emancipated in the 19th century. British Jews had numbered fewer than 10,000 in 1800 but around 120,000 after 1881 when Russian Jews settled permanently in Britain.[13]\\r\\nThe substantial immigration to the United Kingdom since the 1920s has contributed to the growth of foreign faiths, especially of Islam, Hinduism and Sikhism,[14] Buddhism in the United Kingdom experienced growth partly due to immigration and partly due to conversion (especially when including Secular Buddhism).[15]\\r\\nAs elsewhere in the western world, religious demographics have become part of the discourse on multiculturalism, with Britain variously described as a post-Christian society,[16] as \\"multi-faith\\",[17] or as secularised.[18] Scholars have suggested multiple possible reasons for the decline, but have not agreed on their relative importance. Martin Wellings lays out the \\"classical model\\" of secularization, while noting that it has been challenged by some scholars.\\r\\nThe familiar starting-point, a classical model of secularization, argues that religious faith becomes less plausible and religious practice more difficult in advanced industrial and urbanized societies. The breakdown or disruption of traditional communities and norms of behavior; the spread of a scientific world-view diminishing the scope of the supernatural and the role of God; increasing material affluence promoting self-reliance and this-worldly optimism; and greater awareness and toleration of different creeds and ideas, encouraging religious pluralism and eviscerating commitment to a particular faith, all form components of the case for secularization. Applied to the British churches in general by Steve Bruce and to Methodism in particular by Robert Currie, this model traces decline back to the Victorian era and charts in the twentieth century a steady ebbing of the sea of faith.[19][20][21]\\r\\nThe statistics for current religion (not religion of upbringing where also asked) from the 2011 census and the corresponding statistics from the 2001 census are set out in the tables below.\\r\\nReligious affiliations of UK citizens are recorded by regular surveys, the four major ones being the UK Census,[30] the Labour Force Survey,[31] the British Social Attitudes survey[32] and the European Social Survey.[33] The different questions asked by these surveys produced different results:\\r\\nThe wording of the question affects the outcome of polls as is apparent when comparing the results of the Scottish census with that of the English and Welsh census.[35][37][41][42] An ICM poll for The Guardian in 2006 asked the question \\"Which religion do you yourself belong to?\\" with a response of 64 percent stating 'Christian' and 26% stating 'None'. In the same survey, 63% claimed they are not religious with just 33% claiming they are.[43] This suggests that the religious UK population identify themselves as having Christian beliefs, but maybe not as active 'church-goers'.[44]\\r\\nThe British Social Attitudes surveys and the European Social Surveys are fielded to adult individuals.[39][40] In contrast, the United Kingdom Census and the Labour Force Surveys are household surveys; the respondent completes the questionnaire on behalf of each member of the household,[41][42][45] including children,[38] as well as for themselves. The 2010 Labour Force Survey claimed that 54% of children aged from birth to four years were Christian, rising to 59% for children aged between 5 and 9 and 65% for children aged between 10 and 14.[38] The inclusion of children with adult-imposed religions influences the results of the polls.[44][46]\\r\\nOther major polls agree with the British Social Attitudes surveys and the European Social Surveys, with a YouGov survey fielded in February 2012 indicating that 43% of respondents claimed to belong to a religion and 76% claimed they were not very religious or not religious at all.[47] An Ipsos MORI survey fielded in August 2003 indicated that 18% of respondents claimed to be \\"a practising member of an organised religion\\" and 25% claimed \\"I am a non-practising member of an organised religion\\".[48]\\r\\nA 2015 study estimated some 25,000 believers in Christ from a Muslim background, most of whom belong to an evangelical or Pentecostal community.[52]\\r\\nSource: BSA Survey 2009.[54][55]\\r\\nIn the 2011 census, Christianity was the largest religion, stated as their affiliation by 59.5% of respondents.[22][23][25] This figure was found to be 53% in the 2007 Tearfund survey,[56] 42.9 percent in the 2009 British Social Attitudes Survey[53] and 42.98 percent in the EU-funded European Social Survey published in April 2009[40] for those identifying as Christian.\\r\\nAlthough there was no UK-wide data in the 2001 or the 2011 census on adherence to individual Christian denominations,[57] Ceri Peach estimated in 2005 that 62% of Christians were Anglican, 13.5% Catholic, 6% Presbyterian and 3.4% Methodist, with small numbers in other Protestant denominations and the Orthodox church.[58] The 2009 British Social Attitudes Survey, which covers Great Britain but not Northern Ireland, indicated that over 50 percent would self-classify as not religious at all, 19.9 percent were part of the Church of England, 9.3% non-denominational Christian, 8.6% Catholic, 2.2% Presbyterian/Church of Scotland, 1.3% Methodist, 0.53% Baptist, 1.17% other Protestant, 0.23% United Reformed Church/Congregational, 0.06% Free Presbyterian, 0.03% Brethren Christian and 0.41% other Christian.[53]\\r\\nIn a 2015 survey conducted by BSA (British Social Attitudes) on religious affiliation; 49% of respondents indicated 'no religion' and 42% indicated they were Christians, while 8% affiliated with non-Christian religions (Islam, Hinduism, Judaism etc.)[59]\\r\\nThe Pew Research Center Western Europe Survey held in August 2017 asked the question \\"What is your present religion, if any?\\" with 17% of respondents selcting 'Catholicism', 54% selecting 'Protestantism', and 24% selecting 'Unaffiliated'.\\r\\nReligions other than Christianity, such as Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism and Judaism, have established a presence in the United Kingdom, both through immigration and by attracting converts. Others that have done so include the Bah' Faith, the Rastafari movement and Neopaganism.\\r\\nSociety in the United Kingdom is markedly more secular than it was in the past and the number of churchgoers fell over the second half of the 20th century.[60] The Ipsos MORI poll in 2003 reported that 18% were \\"a practising member of an organised religion\\".[48] The Tearfund Survey in 2007 found that only 7% of the population considered themselves as practising Christians. Some 10% attended church weekly and two-thirds had not gone to church in the past year.[56][61] The Tearfund Survey also found that two-thirds of UK adults (66%) or 32.2 million people had no connection with the Church at present (nor with another religion). These people were evenly divided between those who have been in the past but have since left (16 million) and those who have never been in their lives (16.2 million).\\r\\nA survey in 2002 found Christmas attendance at Anglican churches in England varied between 10.19% of the population in the diocese of Hereford, down to just 2.16% in Manchester.[62] Church attendance at Christmas in some dioceses was up to three times the average for the rest of the year. Overall church attendance at Christmas has been steadily increasing in recent years; a 2005 poll found that 43 per cent expected to attend a church service over the Christmas period, in comparison with 39% and 33% for corresponding polls taken in 2003 and 2001 respectively.[63]\\r\\nA December 2007 report by Christian Research showed that the services of the Catholic Church had become the best-attended services of Christian denominations in England, with average attendance at Sunday Mass of 861,000, compared to 852,000 attending Anglican services. Attendance at Anglican services had declined by 20% between 2000 and 2006, while attendance at Catholic services, boosted by large-scale immigration from Poland and Lithuania, had declined by only 13%. In Scotland, attendance at Church of Scotland services declined by 19% and attendance at Catholic services fell by 25%.[64] British Social Attitudes Surveys have shown the proportion of those in Great Britain who consider they \\"belong to\\" Christianity to have fallen from 66% in 1983 to 43% in 2009.[53]\\r\\nIn 2012 about 6% of the population of the United Kingdom regularly attended church, with the average age of attendees being 51; in contrast, in 1980, 11% had regularly attended, with an average age of 37. It is predicted that by 2020 attendance will be around 4%, with an average age of 56.[60] This decline in church attendance has forced many churches to close down across the United Kingdom, with the Church of England alone closing 1,500 churches between 1969 and 2002. Their fates include dereliction, demolition, and residential, artistic and commercial conversion.[65] In October 2014 weekly attendance at Church of England services dropped below 1 million for the first time. At Christmas 2014, 2.4 million attended. For that year baptisms were 130,000, down 12% since 2004; marriages were 50,000, down 19%; and funerals 146,000, down 29%. The Church estimated that about 1% of churchgoers were lost to death each year; the Church's age profile suggested that attendances would continue to decline.[66]\\r\\nOne study showed that in 2004 at least 930,000 Muslims attended a mosque at least once a week, just outnumbering the 916,000 regular churchgoers in the Church of England.[67] Muslim sources claim the number of practising Muslims is underestimated as nearly all of them pray at home.[68]\\r\\n\\"Do you consider yourself as belonging to any particular religion or denomination?\\"\\r\\nSource: European social survey 2002ÿ2010[69]\\r\\nThere is a disparity between the figures for those identifying themselves with a particular religion and for those proclaiming a belief in a God:\\r\\nIn the 2001 census, 390,127 individuals (0.7 percent of total respondents) in England and Wales self-identified as followers of the Jedi faith. This Jedi census phenomenon followed an internet campaign that stated, incorrectly, that the Jedi belief system would receive official government recognition as a religion if it received enough support in the census.[73] An email in support of the campaign, quoted by BBC News, invited people to \\"do it because you love Star Wars?... or just to annoy people\\".[74] The Office for National Statistics revealed the total figure in a press release entitled \\"390,000 Jedi there are\\".[75]\\r\\nChurches Together in England\\r\\nThe United Kingdom was formed by the union of previously independent states in 1707,[76][77][78] and consequently most of the largest religious groups do not have UK-wide organisational structures. While some groups have separate structures for the individual countries of the United Kingdom, others have a single structure covering England and Wales or Great Britain. Similarly, due to the relatively recent creation of Northern Ireland in 1921, most major religious groups in Northern Ireland are organised on an all-Ireland basis.\\r\\nThe Church of England is the established church in England.[5] Its most senior bishops sit in the national parliament and the Queen is its supreme governor. It is also the \\"mother church\\" of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Church of England separated from the Catholic Church in 1534 and became the established church by an Act of Parliament in the Act of Supremacy, beginning a series of events known as the English Reformation.[79] Historically it has been the predominant Christian denomination in England and Wales, in terms of both influence and number of adherents.\\r\\nThe Scottish Episcopal Church, which is part of the Anglican Communion (but not a \\"daughter church\\" of the Church of England),[80] dates from the final establishment of Presbyterianism in Scotland in 1690, when it split from the Church of Scotland. In the 1920s, the Church in Wales became disestablished and independent from the Church of England, but remains in the Anglican Communion.[81]\\r\\nDuring the years 2012 to 2014 the number of members of the Church of England dropped by around 1.7 million.[82][83][84]\\r\\nThe Catholic Church has separate national organisations for England and Wales, for Scotland and for Ireland, which means there is no single hierarchy for the Catholic Church in the United Kingdom. The Catholic Church in England and Wales is the second largest Christian church with around five million members, mainly in England.[85] There is, however, a single apostolic nuncio to Great Britain, presently Archbishop Edward Joseph Adams. The Catholic Church in Scotland is Scotland's second largest Christian church, representing a sixth of the population.[86] The apostolic nuncio to the whole of Ireland (both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland) is Charles Brown. Eastern Rite Catholics in the United Kingdom are served by their own clergy and do not belong to the Latin Church dioceses but are still in full communion with the Bishop of Rome.\\r\\nIn Scotland, the Church of Scotland (informally known by its Scots language name, \\"the Kirk\\"), is recognised as the national church.[87] It is not subject to state control and the British monarch is an ordinary member, required to swear an oath to \\"maintain and preserve the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Government\\" upon his or her accession.[88] Splits in the Church of Scotland, especially in the 19th century, led to the creation of various other Presbyterian churches in Scotland, including the Free Church of Scotland, which claims to be the constitutional continuator of the Church in Scotland and was founded in 1843. The Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland was formed in 1893 by some who left the Free Church over alleged weakening of her position and likewise claims to be the spiritual descendant of the Scottish Reformation. The Evangelical Presbyterian Church in England and Wales was founded in the late 1980s and organized themselves as a presbytery in 1996. As of 2016[update] they had 15 churches in the UK.[89]\\r\\nThe Presbyterian Church in Ireland is the largest Protestant denomination and second largest church in Northern Ireland. The Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster was founded on 17 March 1951 by the cleric and politician Ian Paisley. It has about 60 churches in Northern Ireland. The Presbyterian Church of Wales seceded from the Church of England in 1811 and formally formed itself into a separate body in 1823. The Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland has 31 congregations in Northern Ireland,[90] with the first Presbytery being formed in Antrim in 1725.[91]\\r\\nThe United Reformed Church (URC), a union of Presbyterian and Congregational churches, consists of about 1,500 congregations[92] in England, Scotland and Wales. There are about 600 Congregational churches in the United Kingdom. In England there are three main groups, the Congregational Federation, the Evangelical Fellowship of Congregational Churches, and about 100 Congregational churches that are loosely federated with other congregations in the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches, or are unaffiliated. In Scotland the churches are mostly member of the Congregational Federation and in Wales which traditionally has a larger number of Congregationalists, most are members of the Union of Welsh Independents.\\r\\nThe Methodist movement traces its origin to the evangelical awakening in the 18th century. The British Methodist Church, which has congregations throughout Great Britain, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, Malta and Gibraltar, has around 290,000 members,[93] and 5,900 churches,[93] though only around 3,000 members in 50 congregations are in Scotland. In the 1960s, it made ecumenical overtures to the Church of England, aimed at church unity. Formally, these failed when they were rejected by the Church of England's General Synod in 1972. However, conversations and co-operation continued, leading on 1 November 2003 to the signing of a covenant between the two churches.[94]\\r\\nThe Methodist Church in Ireland covers the whole of the island of Ireland, including Northern Ireland where it is the fourth-largest denomination.\\r\\nOther Methodist denominations in Britain include the Salvation Army, founded in 1865;[95] the Free Methodist Church, a holiness church; and the Church of the Nazarene.\\r\\nThe Baptist Union of Great Britain, despite its name, covers just England and Wales.[96] There is a separate Baptist Union of Scotland and the Association of Baptist Churches in Ireland is an all-Ireland organisation.[97] Other Baptist associations also exist in England, such as the Grace Baptist association and the Gospel Standard Baptists.\\r\\nAssemblies of God in Great Britain are part of the World Assemblies of God Fellowship with over 600 churches in Great Britain.[98] Assemblies of God Ireland cover the whole of the island of Ireland, including Northern Ireland. The Apostolic Church commenced in the early part of the 20th century in South Wales and now has over 110 churches across the United Kingdom. Elim Pentecostal Church as of 2013[update] had over 500 churches across the United Kingdom.[98]\\r\\nThere is also a growing number of independent, charismatic churches that encourage Pentecostal practices as part of their worship. These are broadly grouped together as the British New Church Movement and could number up to 400,000 members. The phenomenon of immigrant churches and congregations that began with the arrival of the SS Empire Windrush from the West Indies in 1948 stands as a unique trend. West Indian congregations that started from this time include the Church of God, New Testament Assembly and New Testament Church of God.\\r\\nAfricans began to arrive in the early 1980s and established their own congregations. Foremost among these are Matthew Ashimolowo from Nigeria and his Kingsway International Christian Centre in London that may be the largest church in Western Europe.[99]\\r\\nThe Russian Orthodox Church has a Diocese of Sourozh, which covers Great Britain and Ireland,[100] and the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia also has a diocese in the same territory.[101] The Ecumenical Patriarchate has established the Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain, led by Archbishop Gregorios,[102] that covers England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland as well as Malta. The Patriarchate of Antioch has 15 parishes and 7 missions within the Deanery of the United Kingdom and Ireland.[103] The Serbian Orthodox Church has nine parishes in the United Kingdom and missions in Dublin and Malta, under the Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Britain and Scandinavia.[104] Other Eastern Orthodox Churches represented in the United Kingdom include the Georgian Orthodox Church, the Romanian Orthodox Church and the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.\\r\\nThe Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria has two regional Dioceses in the United Kingdom: the Diocese of Ireland, Scotland, North East England and its Affiliated Areas is led by Bishop Antony of Newcastle and the Diocese of the Midlands and its Affiliated Areas is led by Bishop Missael of Birmingham. There is also (part of the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate until 2015) the British Orthodox Church, (covering the British Isles) which is led by Metropolitan Seraphim of Glastonbury. In addition, there is one General Bishop in Stevenage, Bishop Angaelos. There are many Coptic Orthodox Churches in the United Kingdom that are directly the responsibility of Pope Tawadros II of Alexandria. Other Oriental Orthodox Churches represented in the United Kingdom include the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.\\r\\nOther denominations and groups include the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Seventh Day Baptists, the Plymouth Brethren,[105] and Newfrontiers.[106]\\r\\nThe first missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints to proselytise in the British Isles arrived in 1837. By 1900 as many as 100,000 converts had joined the faith, but most of these early members soon emigrated to the United States to join the main body of the church. From the 1950s emigration to the United States began to be discouraged and local congregations grew more rapidly. Today the church claims just over 186,000 members across the United Kingdom, in over 330 local congregations, known as 'wards' or 'branches'. The church also maintains two temples in England, the first opening in the London area in 1958, and the second completed in 1998 in Preston and known as the Preston England Temple. Preston is also the site of the first preaching by LDS missionaries in 1837, and is home to the oldest continually existing Latter Day Saint congregation anywhere in the world.[107][108] Restored 1994ÿ2000, the Gadfield Elm Chapel in Worcestershire is the oldest extant chapel of the LDS Church.[109]\\r\\nJehovah's Witnesses had 137,631 \\"publishers\\" (a term referring to members actively involved in preaching) in the United Kingdom in 2015.[110] The Church of Christ, Scientist is also represented in the UK. The General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches is the umbrella organisation for Unitarian, Free Christian and other liberal religious congregations in the United Kingdom. The Unitarian Christian Association was formed in 1991. There are an estimated 18,000 Christadelphians in the UK.\\r\\nThe Britain Yearly Meeting is the umbrella body for the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Great Britain, the Channel Isles and the Isle of Man. It has 14,260 adult members.[111] Northern Ireland comes under the umbrella of the Ireland Yearly Meeting.\\r\\nEstimates in 2009 suggested a total of about 2.4 million Muslims over all the United Kingdom.[112][113] According to Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, the number of Muslims in Britain could be up to 3 million.[114] The vast majority of Muslims in the United Kingdom live in England and Wales: of 1,591,126 Muslims recorded at the 2001 Census, 1,546,626 were living in England and Wales, where they form 3 per cent of the population; 42,557 were living in Scotland, forming 0.8 per cent of the population;[115] and 1,943 were living in Northern Ireland.[116] Between 2001 and 2009 the Muslim population increased roughly 10 times faster than the rest of society.[117]\\r\\nMost Muslim immigrants to the United Kingdom came from former colonies. The biggest groups of Muslims are of Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Indian and Arab origins,[118] with the remainder coming from Muslim-dominated areas such as Southwest Asia, Somalia, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[119] During the 18th century, lascars (sailors) who worked for the British East India Company settled in port towns with local wives.[120] These numbered only 24,037 in 1891 but 51,616 on the eve of World War I.[121] Naval cooks, including Sake Dean Mahomet, also came from what is now the Sylhet Division of Bangladesh.[122] From the 1950s onwards, the growing Muslim population has led to a number of notable Mosques being established, including East London Mosque, London Central Mosque, Manchester Central Mosque, London Markaz, and the Baitul Futuh of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. According to Kevin Brice, a researcher at the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David, thousands convert to Islam annually and there are approximately 100,000 converts to Islam in Britain, where they run two mosques.[123]\\r\\nAccording to a Labour Force Survey estimate, the total number of Muslims in Great Britain in 2008 was 2,422,000, around 4 per cent of the total population.[124] Between 2004 and 2008, the Muslim population grew by more than 500,000.[124] In 2010, The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life estimated 2,869,000 Muslims in Great Britain.[125] The largest age-bracket within the British Muslim population were those under the age of 4, at 301,000 in September 2008.[124] The Muslim Council of Britain and the Islamic Forum of Europe are the umbrellas organisations for many local, regional and specialist Islamic organisations in the United Kingdom, although it is disputed how representative this organisation is of British Muslims as a whole.\\r\\nThe Jewish Naturalisation Act, enacted in 1753, permitted the naturalisation of foreign Jews, but was repealed the next year. The first graduate from the University of Glasgow who was openly-known to be Jewish was in 1787. Unlike their English contemporaries, Scottish students were not required to take a religious oath. In 1841 Isaac Lyon Goldsmid was made baronet, the first Jew to receive a hereditary title. The first Jewish Lord Mayor of the City of London, Sir David Salomons, was elected in 1855, followed by the 1858 emancipation of the Jews. On 26 July 1858, Lionel de Rothschild was finally allowed to sit in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom when the law restricting the oath of office to Christians was changed. (Benjamin Disraeli, a baptised, teenage convert to Christianity of Jewish parentage, was already an MP at this time and rose to become Prime Minister in 1874.) In 1884 Nathan Mayer Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild became the first Jewish member of the British House of Lords; again Disraeli was already a member.\\r\\nBritish Jews number around 300,000 with the United Kingdom having the fifth largest Jewish community worldwide.[126] However, this figure did not include Jews who identified 'by ethnicity only' in England and Wales or Scottish Jews who identified as Jewish by upbringing but held no current religion. A report in August 2007 by University of Manchester historian Dr Yaakov Wise stated that 75 per cent of all births in the Jewish community were to ultra-orthodox, Haredi parents, and that the increase of ultra-orthodox Jewry has led to a significant rise in the proportion of British Jews who are ultra-orthodox.[127]\\r\\nHowever various studies suggest that within some Jewish communities and particularly in some strictly Orthodox areas, many residents ignored the voluntary question on religion following the advice of their religious leaders resulting in a serious undercount, therefore it is impossible to give an accurate number on the total UK Jewish population. It may be even more than double the official estimates, heavily powered by the very high birth rate of orthodox families and British people who are Jewish by origin but not religion; as it currently stands, the Jewish as ethnicity section is not documented on the census.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Bah' Faith in the United Kingdom has a historical connection with the earliest phases of the Bah' Faith starting in 1845 and has had a major effect on the development of communities of the religion in far flung nations around the world. It is estimated that between 1951 and 1993, Bah's from the United Kingdom settled in 138 countries.[128]\\r\\nThe earliest Buddhist influence on Britain came through its imperial connections with Southeast Asia, and as a result the early connections were with the Theravada traditions of Burma, Thailand, and Sri Lanka. The tradition of study resulted in the foundation of the Pali Text Society, which undertook the task of translating the Pali Canon of Buddhist texts into English. Buddhism as a path of practise was pioneered by the Theosophists, Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott, and in 1880 they became the first Westerners to receive the refuges and precepts, the ceremony by which one traditionally becomes a Buddhist.\\r\\nIn 1924 London's Buddhist Society was founded, and in 1926 the Theravadin London Buddhist Vihara. The rate of growth was slow but steady through the century, and the 1950s saw the development of interest in Zen Buddhism. In 1967 Kagyu Samy Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre, now the largest Tibetan Buddhist centre in Western Europe, was founded in Scotland. The first home-grown Buddhist movement was also founded in 1967, the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (now the Triratna Buddhist Community). There are some Soka Gakkai groups in the United Kingdom.\\r\\nHinduism was the religion of 558,810 people in Great Britain according to the 2001 census[129] but an estimate in a British newspaper in 2007 has put the figure as high as 1.5 million.[130] One Non-governmental organisation estimated as of 2007 that there are 800,000 Hindus in the United Kingdom.[131] Although most British Hindus live in England, with half living in London alone,[132] small but growing Hindu communities also exist in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\\r\\nAs of 2006, there are around 25,000 Jains in the United Kingdom.[133]\\r\\nOne of the first Jain settlers, Champat Rai Jain, was in England during 1892ÿ1897 to study law. He established the Rishabh Jain Lending Library in 1930. Later, he translated several Jain texts into English.[134]\\r\\nLeicester houses one of the world's few Jain temples outside of India.[135] There is an Institute of Jainology at Greenford, London.[136]\\r\\nSikhism was recorded as the religion of 336,149 people in the United Kingdom at the time of the 2001 Census.[137] While England is home to the majority of Sikhs in the United Kingdom, small communities also exist in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\\r\\nThe first recorded Sikh settler in the United Kingdom was Maharaja Duleep Singh, dethroned and exiled in 1849 at the age of 14, after the Anglo-Sikh wars. The first Sikh Gurdwara (temple) was established in 1911, in Putney, London. The first wave of Sikh migration came in the 1950s, mostly of men from the Punjab seeking work in industries such as foundries and textiles. These new arrivals mostly settled in London, Birmingham and West Yorkshire. Thousands of Sikhs from East Africa followed.\\r\\nIn the 2001 Census, a total of 42,262 people from England, Scotland, and Wales declared themselves to be pagans or adherents of Wicca. However, other surveys have led to estimates of around 250,000 or even higher.[138][139]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, census figures do not allow an accurate breakdown of traditions within the Pagan heading, as a campaign by the Pagan Federation before the 2001 Census encouraged Wiccans, Heathens, Druids and others all to use the same write-in term 'Pagan' in order to maximise the numbers reported. For the first time, respondents were able to write in an affiliation not covered by the checklist of common religions, and a total of 42,262 people from England, Scotland and Wales declared themselves to be Pagans by this method. These figures were not immediately analysed by the Office for National Statistics, but were released after an application by the Pagan Federation of Scotland.[140]\\r\\nDuring the Iron Age, Celtic polytheism was the predominant religion in the area now known as England. Neo-Druidism grew out of the Celtic revival in 18th century Romanticism. A 2012 Druid analysis estimates that there are roughly 11,000 Druids in Britain.[141]\\r\\nThough the main political parties are secular, the formation of the Labour Party was influenced by Christian socialism and by leaders from a nonconformist background, such as Keir Hardie. On the other hand, the Church of England was once nicknamed \\"the Conservative Party at prayer\\", though this has changed since the 1980s as the Church has moved to the left of the Conservative Party on social and economic issues.[142]\\r\\nSome minor parties are explicitly 'religious' in ideology: two 'Christian' parties ÿ the Christian Party and the Christian Peoples Alliance, fielded joint candidates at the 2009 European Parliament elections and increased their share of the vote to come eighth, with 249,493 votes (1.6% of total votes cast), and in London, where the CPA had three councillors,[143] the Christian parties picked up 51,336 votes (2.9% of the vote), up slightly from the 45,038 gained in 2004.[144]\\r\\nThe Church of England is represented in the UK Parliament by 26 bishops (the Lords Spiritual) and the British monarch is a member of the church (required under Article 2 of the Treaty of Union) as well as its Supreme Governor.[145] The Lords Spiritual have seats in the House of Lords and debate government policies affecting the whole of the United Kingdom. The Church of England also has the right to draft legislative measures (related to religious administration) through the General Synod that can then be passed into law by Parliament.[146] The Prime Minister, regardless of personal beliefs, plays a key role in the appointment of Church of England bishops, although in July 2007 Gordon Brown proposed reforms of the Prime Minister's ability to affect Church of England appointments.[147]\\r\\nReligious education and Collective Worship are compulsory in many state schools in England and Wales by virtue of clauses 69 and 70 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Clause 71 of the act gives parents the right to withdraw their children from Religious Education and Collective Worship[148] and parents should be informed of their right in accordance with guidelines published by the Department for Education; \\"a school should ensure parents or carers are informed of this right\\".[149] The content of the religious education is decided locally by the Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education.\\r\\nIn England and Wales, a significant number of state funded schools are faith schools with the vast majority Christian (mainly either of Church of England or Catholic) though there are also Jewish, Muslim and Sikh faith schools. Faith schools follow the same national curriculum as state schools, though with the added ethos of the host religion. Until 1944 there was no requirement for state schools to provide religious education or worship, although most did so. The Education Act 1944 introduced a requirement for a daily act of collective worship and for religious education but did not define what was allowable under these terms. The act contained provisions to allow parents to withdraw their children from these activities and for teachers to refuse to participate. The Education Reform Act 1988 introduced a further requirement that the majority of collective worship be \\"wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character\\".[150] According to a 2003 report from the Office for Standards in Education, a \\"third of governing bodies do not fulfil their statutory duties adequately, sometimes because of a failure to pursue thoroughly enough such matters as arranging a daily act of collective worship.\\"[151]\\r\\nIn Scotland, the majority of schools are non-denominational, but separate Catholic schools, with an element of control by the Catholic Church, are provided within the state system. The Education (Scotland) Act 1980 imposes a statutory duty on all local authorities to provide religious education and religious observance in Scottish schools. These are currently defined by the Scottish Government's Curriculum for Excellence (2005).[152]\\r\\nNorthern Ireland has a highly segregated education system. 95 per cent of pupils attend either maintained (Catholic) schools or controlled schools, which are open to children of all faiths and none, though in practise most pupils are from the Protestant community.[citation needed]\\r\\nPrisoners are given religious freedom and privileges while in prison. This includes access to a chaplain or religious advisor, authorised religious reading materials,[153] ability to change faith, as well as other privileges.[154] Several faith-based outreach programmes provide faith promoting guidance and counselling.[155][156][157]\\r\\nEvery three months, the Ministry of Justice collects data, including religious affiliation, of all UK prisoners and is published as the Offender Management Caseload Statistics.[158] This data is then compiled into reports and published in the House of Commons library.\\r\\nOn 31 March 2015 the prison population of England and Wales was recorded as 49% Christian, 14% Muslim, 2% Buddhist, 2% other religions and 31% no religion.[159]\\r\\nThe Communications Act 2003 requires certain broadcasters in the United Kingdom to carry a \\"suitable quantity and range of programmes\\" dealing with religion and other beliefs, as part of their public service broadcasting.[160] Prominent examples of religious programming include the BBC television programme Songs of Praise, aired on a Sunday evening with an average weekly audience of 2.5 million,[161] and the Thought for the Day slot on BBC Radio 4. Channels also offer documentaries on, or from the perspective of a criticism of organised religion. A significant example is Richard Dawkins' two-part Channel 4 documentary, The Root of all Evil?. Open disbelief of, or even mockery of organised religion, is not regarded as a taboo in the British media, though it has occasionally provoked controversy ÿ for example, the movie Monty Python's Life of Brian,[162] the poem \\"The Love That Dares to Speak Its Name\\",[163] and the musical Jerry Springer: The Opera,[164] all of which involved characters based on Jesus, were subject to public outcry and blasphemy allegations, while The Satanic Verses, a novel by British Indian author Salman Rushdie which includes a fantasy sequence about Muhammed, caused global protests including several by British Muslims.[165] British comedy has a history of parody on the subject of religion.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Interfaith Network for the United Kingdom encompasses the main faith organisations of the United Kingdom, either directly with denominational important representatives or through joint bodies for these denominations, promotes local interfaith cooperation, promotes understanding between faiths and convenes meetings and conferences where social and religious questions of concern to the different faith communities can be examined together, including meetings of the Network's Faith Communities Consultative Forum.[167]\\r\\nEcumenical friendship and cooperation has gradually developed between Christian denominations and where inter-sect prejudice exists this has via education and employment policy been made a pressing public matter in dealing with its two prominent examples ÿ sectarianism in Glasgow and Northern Ireland ÿ where segregation is declining.\\r\\nIn the early 21st century, the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 made it an offence in England and Wales to incite hatred against a person on the grounds of their religion. The common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were abolished with the coming into effect of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 on 8 July 2008.\\r\\n2005ÿ2010 polls have shown that public opinion in the United Kingdom generally tends towards a suspicion or outright disapproval of radical or evangelical religiosity, though moderate groups and individuals are rarely subject to less favourable treatment from society or employers.[168]\\r\\nThe Equality Act 2010 prohibits discrimination against people on the basis of religion, in the supply of goods and services and selection for employment, subject to very limited exceptions (such as the right of schools and religious institutions to appoint paid ministers).\\r\\nThere is no strict separation of church and state in the United Kingdom. Accordingly, most public officials may display the most common identifiers of a major religion in the course of their duties ÿ for example, turbans. Chaplains are provided in the armed forces (see Royal Army Chaplains' Department, RAF Chaplains Branch) and in prisons.\\r\\nAlthough school uniform codes are generally drawn up flexibly enough to accommodate compulsory items of religious dress, some schools have banned wearing the crucifix in a necklace, arguing that to do so is not a requirement of Christianity where they prohibit all other necklaces. Post-adolescence, the wearing of a necklace is permitted in some F.E. colleges who permit religious insignia necklaces on a wider basis, which are without exception permitted at universities.[169]\\r\\nSome churches have warned that the Equality Act 2010 could force them to go against their faith when hiring staff.[170]\\r\\nIn 2011 two judges of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales upheld previous statements in the country's jurisprudence that the (non-canon) laws of the United Kingdom 'do not include Christianity'. Therefore, a local authority was acting lawfully in denying a Christian married couple the right to foster care because of stated negative views on homosexuality. In terms of the rights recognised \\"in the case of fostering arrangements at least, the right of homosexuals to equality should take precedence over the right of Christians to manifest their beliefs and moral values.\\"[171]\\r\\nLevels of affiliation vary between different part of the UK, particularly between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The percentages declaring themselves Christians in the 2011 Census are 59.4 in England, 57.6 in Wales and 53.8 in Scotland, which decreased by 12.3, 14.3, and 11.3 percentage points respectively from the census of 2001.[172][173][174][175] This is argued to make them the fastest secularising nations in history.[176] Northern Ireland remains one of the most religious nations in western Europe[citation needed] with 82.3% of the population claiming Christian affiliation, with a decline of only 3.5% by the 2011 census, while \\"other religions\\" have increased in membership.[172] Religion has been seen as both a product and a cause of political divisions in Northern Ireland.[177]\\r\\nCHRISTIAN\\r\\nJEWISH\\r\\nISLAMIC\\r\\nOTHERS","input":"What is the most popular religion in uk?"},{"output":"Rafael Nadal","context":"The ATP Rankings are the Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP) merit-based method for determining the rankings in men's tennis. The top-ranked player is the player who, over the previous 52 weeks, has garnered the most ATP ranking points. Points are awarded based on how far a player advances in tournaments and the category of those tournaments. The ATP has used a computerized system for determining the rankings since 23 August 1973.[1] Starting in 1979, an updated rankings list is released at the beginning of each week.[2]\\r\\nSince 1973, 26 men have been ranked number 1 by the ATP,[3][4] of which 17 have been year-end number 1. The current world number one is Rafael Nadal.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the introduction of the ATP rankings the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times. As of 2011, the rankings are calculated by totaling the points a player wins in his best eighteen tournaments, subject to certain restrictions. For top players the counting tournaments are the four Grand Slam tournaments, the eight mandatory ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournaments, the player's best four eligible ATP World Tour 500 series tournaments (the non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000 event in Monte Carlo may be substituted for one of these), and his best two results from ATP World Tour 250 series. Lower-ranked players who are not eligible for some or all of the top tournaments may include additional ATP 500 and ATP 250 events, and also ATP Challenger Series, and Futures Series tournaments. The ranking points of players who qualify for the year-end ATP World Tour Finals also include any points gained at that tournament, increasing their counting tournament total to nineteen.[6]\\r\\nRoger Federer holds the records for both the most total weeks at No. 1 (302) and most consecutive weeks at No. 1 (237).[7] Pete Sampras holds the record for the most year-end No. 1 (six, all consecutive).[8][9] Patrick Rafter spent the fewest weeks at No. 1 (one week).\\r\\nLleyton Hewitt is both the youngest world No. 1 (20 years, 268 days) and youngest year-end No. 1,[10][11] while Ivan Lendl is the oldest year-end No. 1 (29 years, 299 days).

Late on the night of June?11 or early morning of June?12, inmates Clarence Anglin, John Anglin, and Frank Morris tucked heads made out of soap wax resembling their own likenesses into their beds, broke out of the main prison building via an unused utility corridor, and departed Alcatraz Island aboard an improvised inflatable raft to an uncertain fate.[2]\\r\\nHundreds of leads and theories have been pursued by the FBI and local law enforcement officials in the ensuing years, but no conclusive evidence has ever surfaced favoring the success or failure of the attempt.[2] In 1979 the F.B.I. officially concluded, on the basis of circumstantial evidence and a preponderance of expert opinion, that the men drowned in the frigid waters of San Francisco Bay before reaching the mainland.[3] The U.S. Marshals Service case file remains open and active, however, Morris and the Anglin brothers remain on its wanted list.[4][5]\\r\\nRecent experimental and computer-simulated evidence has suggested that the ultimate outcome of the attempt may have depended on the exact time of the men's departure aboard the raft. A 2015 documentary presented circumstantial evidence in support of a longstanding rumor that two of the men ÿ the Anglin brothers ÿ had survived and fled to Brazil; a government expert concluded that the one piece of physical evidence, a 1975 photograph, did support that conclusion.[citation needed] In 2013, a letter allegedly written by one of the escapees, John Anglin, was sent to the San Francisco police department. When analyzed for a link to Anglin, it was deemed inconclusive.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the 36?inmates who staged 14?escape attempts over the 29?years that Alcatraz served as a federal penitentiary,[6] 23 were recaptured, six were shot and killed, two drowned, and five (including Morris and the Anglins) are listed as missing and presumed drowned.[5]\\r\\nOne inmate, John Paul Scott, successfully swam a distance of 2.7 nautical miles (5.0?km; 3.1?mi) from the island to Fort Point, at the southern end of the Golden Gate Bridge, on December 16, 1962. Some teenagers who were on the beach at the time found him and called the police because they thought he was dead. When the police saw him, he was immediately identified as the escapee they had been looking for. He was recaptured the same day and sent back to Alcatraz,[7] exhausted and hypothermic.[8] Today, multitudes of athletes swim the same AlcatrazÿFort Point route as part of one of two annual triathlon events.[9][10]\\r\\nFrank Lee Morris (September 1, 1926 ÿ disappeared June 11, 1962) was born in Washington, D.C.. He was orphaned at age?11, and spent most of his formative years in foster homes. He was convicted of his first crime at age?13, and by his late teens had been arrested for crimes ranging from narcotics possession to armed robbery.[11][12] Morris reportedly ranked in the top 2% of the general population in intelligence, as measured by IQ testing, displaying an IQ of 133. He served time in Florida and Georgia, then escaped from the Louisiana State Penitentiary while serving 10?years for bank robbery. He was recaptured a year later while committing a burglary, and sent to Alcatraz in 1960 as inmate number AZ1441.\\r\\nThe Anglin brothers, John William (May 2, 1930 ÿ disappeared June 11, 1962) and Clarence (May 11, 1931 ÿ disappeared June 11, 1962) were born into a family of thirteen children in Donalsonville, Georgia. Their parents, George Robert Anglin and Rachael Van Miller Anglin, were seasonal farm workers; in the early 1940s, they moved the family to Ruskin, Florida, 20?miles south of Tampa, where the truck farms and tomato fields provided a more reliable source of income. Each June they would migrate north as far as Michigan to pick cherries. Clarence and John were reportedly inseparable as youngsters; they became skilled swimmers, and amazed their siblings by swimming in the frigid waters of Lake Michigan as ice still floated on its surface.\\r\\nThey began robbing banks and other establishments as a team in the early 1950s, usually targets that were closed, to ensure that no one got injured. They claimed that they used a weapon only once, during a bank heist ÿ a toy gun.[13] They were arrested in 1956. Both received 15- to 20-year sentences, which they served at Florida State Prison, Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary, and then Atlanta Penitentiary.[citation needed] After repeated failed attempts to escape from the Atlanta facility, the brothers were transferred to Alcatraz.[14] John arrived on October 21, 1960, as inmate AZ1476, and Clarence on January 10, 1961, as inmate AZ1485.[citation needed]\\r\\nAllen Clayton West (March 25, 1929 ÿ December 21, 1978)[15] was imprisoned for car theft in 1955, first at Atlanta Penitentiary, then at Florida State Prison. After an unsuccessful escape attempt from the Florida facility, he was transferred to Alcatraz in 1957 and became inmate AZ1335.[citation needed] When West was transferred to Alcatraz, he was 31 years old, and had the education of an eighth grader. West was arrested over 20 times throughout his lifetime.[16]\\r\\nWest was the only conspirator who did not participate in the actual escape; he was left behind when a stuck ventilator grill initially prevented him from leaving his cell. He cooperated fully with the escape investigation and was not charged for his role in the attempt.[17][18]\\r\\nWest was transferred to McNeil Island, Washington, when Alcatraz was deactivated in 1963, and later, back to Atlanta Penitentiary. After serving his sentence, followed by two additional sentences in Georgia and Florida, he was released in 1967, only to be arrested again in Florida the following year on charges of grand larceny. At Florida State Prison, he fatally stabbed another prisoner in October 1972, in what may have been a racially motivated incident. He was serving multiple sentences, including life imprisonment on the murder conviction, when he died of acute peritonitis in 1978.[15]\\r\\nThe four inmates began formulating an escape strategy, under the leadership of Morris, the orchestral member of the operation,[19] after they were assigned adjacent cells in December 1961.[6] (The men may have known one another previously, at the federal penitentiary in Atlanta as well.[19]) Working at night over the subsequent six months, they gradually widened ventilation duct openings in their cells' walls, using saw blades they found discarded on the prison grounds, spoons stolen from the commissary, and a drill improvised from the motor of a broken vacuum cleaner.[5] They concealed the holes with cardboard and paint, and their work noise with Morris's accordion playing.[19][6]\\r\\nThe widened holes opened into an unguarded utility corridor behind the cell tier. From the corridor they climbed to the roof of their cell block, inside the building, where they set up a small workshop. There, they assembled a variety of stolen and donated materials, including more than 50?raincoats that they crafted into makeshift life preservers, based on a design they saw in Popular Mechanics,[20] and a 6-by-14-foot (1.8 by 4.3?m) rubber raft, the seams carefully stitched together and sealed with heat from nearby steam pipes. They stole a small accordion-like concertina from another inmate to serve as a bellows to inflate the raft, and built makeshift paddles from scrap wood and stolen screws. Finally, they climbed a ventilation shaft leading to a large fan and grille on the roof and cut away the rivets holding both in place.[19][6]\\r\\nThe men concealed their absences while working outside their cellsand after the escape itselfby sculpting dummy heads from a home-made papier-mach-like mixture of soap, toothpaste, concrete dust, and toilet paper, and giving them a realistic appearance with paint from the maintenance shop and hair from the barbershop floor. With towels and clothing piled under the blankets in their bunks and the dummy heads positioned on the pillows, they appeared to be sleeping peacefully.[21]\\r\\nOn the night of June 11, 1962, with all preparations completed, the men initiated their escape.[6] West had used cement to shore up crumbling concrete around his vent opening, and it had hardened, narrowing the hole and fixing the grill in place. By the time he was able to remove the grill and re-widen the hole sufficiently, the others had left without him; he exited to the roof, then returned to his cell around sunrise and went to sleep.[22] West later cooperated fully with investigators, giving them a detailed description of the escape plan, and as a result was not punished for his role in it.[19]\\r\\nFrom the service corridor, Morris and the Anglins climbed the ventilation shaft to the roof. Guards heard a loud crash as they broke out of the shaft, but since nothing further was heard, the source of the noise was not investigated. Hauling their gear with them, they descended 50 feet (15?m) to the ground by sliding down a kitchen vent pipe, then climbed two 12-foot (3.7?m) barbed-wire perimeter fences. At the northeast shoreline, near the power planta blind spot in the prison's network of searchlights and gun towersthey inflated their raft with the concertina. At some time after 10 o'clock, investigators estimated, they departed in the dense fog toward their objective, Angel Island, two miles to the north.[19][6]\\r\\nThe escape was not discovered until the morning of June 12, 1962, due to the successful dummy head ruse.[23] An extensive air, sea, and land search involving multiple military and law enforcement agencies was conducted over the next 10?days. On June?14, a Coast Guard cutter picked up a paddle floating about 200 yards (180?m) off the southern shore of Angel Island. On the same day in the same general location, workers on another boat found a wallet wrapped in plastic containing names, addresses, and photos of the Anglins' friends and relatives.[5] On June?21, shreds of raincoat material, believed to be remnants of the raft, were found on an Angel Island beach. The following day, a prison boat picked up a deflated life jacket made from the same material 50 yards (46?m) off of Alcatraz Island. No human remains or any other physical evidence of the men's fate was ever found.[24][19]\\r\\nFBI investigators concluded that while it was theoretically possible for one or more of the inmates to have reached Angel Island, the frigid water temperature and strong currents within the bay made it unlikely.[6] According to West, the men had planned to steal clothes and a car once they reached land, but according to the final FBI report, no auto or clothing thefts were reported in that area following the escape, despite the high-profile nature of the case.[6][19] The FBI closed its file on December 31, 1979, after a 17-year investigation.[5] Their official finding was that the prisoners most likely drowned in the cold waters of the bay while attempting to reach Angel Island.[6]\\r\\nThe U.S. Marshals Service investigation remains open, however. As Deputy U.S. Marshal Michael Dyke told NPR in 2009: \\"There's an active warrant, and the Marshals Service doesn't give up looking for people.\\" He said that he still received leads on a regular basis.[25]\\r\\nIn 1993, a former Alcatraz inmate named Thomas Kent told the television program America's Most Wanted that he had helped plan the escape, and claimed to have provided \\"significant new leads\\" to investigators.[26] He said that Clarence Anglin's girlfriend had agreed to meet the men on shore and drive them to Mexico. He declined to participate in the actual escape, he said, because he could not swim. Officials were skeptical of Kent's account, because he had been paid US$2,000 for the interview.[19]\\r\\nA 2003 MythBusters episode[27] on the Discovery Channel tested the feasibility of an escape from the island aboard a raft constructed with the same materials and tools available to the inmates, and determined that it was possible.[19] A 2011 program on the National Geographic Channel asserted that footprints were found on the Angel Island beach where the raft wreckage was recovered, and that contrary to the official FBI report, a car had been stolen in the vicinity on the night of the escape.[19]\\r\\nIn 2011, an 89-year-old man named Bud Morris, who said he was a cousin of Frank Morris, claimed that on \\"eight or nine\\" occasions prior to the escape he delivered envelopes of money to Alcatraz guards, presumably as bribes. He further claimed to have met his cousin face to face in a San Diego park shortly after the escape. His daughter, who was \\"eight or nine\\" years old at the time, said she was present at the meeting with \\"Dad's friend, Frank\\", but \\"had no idea [about the escape]\\".[28]\\r\\nIn 2012, the 50th?anniversary of the escape attempt, the Anglins' two sisters and two of their nephews made public their belief that Clarence and Johnwho would both be well into their eightieswere still alive. Marie Anglin Winder claimed that shortly after the escape in 1962, she received a phone call from San Francisco; the caller said, \\"This is John Anglin.\\" The family also produced a Christmas card, purportedly received in the family mailbox in 1962, saying, \\"To Mother, from John. Merry Christmas.\\"[29] Michael Dyke, the Deputy U.S. Marshal, conceded that there is a \\"possibility that they survived\\", but noted that a Norwegian freighter reported seeing a body floating in the ocean 15 nautical miles (28?km; 17?mi) from the Golden Gate Bridge, about one month after the escape. \\"He had on prison clothesa navy pea coat and a light pair of trouserssimilar to what [Alcatraz] prisoners wore. There were no other missing people during that time period.\\"[30]\\r\\nIn 2014, researchers at Delft University, using a computer model, concluded that if the men set off approximately at midnight, when the currents might have worked in their favor, they could have made landfall; but if they left during the hours before or after, the currents would have been too strong to overcome and they very likely died.[31]\\r\\nA 2015 History Channel documentary presented further circumstantial evidence gathered over the years by the Anglin family.[citation needed] Christmas cards containing the Anglins' handwriting, and allegedly received by family members for three years after the escape, were displayed. While the handwriting was verified as the Anglins', none of the envelopes contained a postmarked stamp, so experts could not determine when they had been delivered.[32] The family cited a story from family friend Fred Brizzi, who grew up with the brothers and claimed to have recognized them in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1975. They produced photographs taken, they said, by Brizzi (who died in 1993), including one showing two men resembling John and Clarence Anglin and the farm near Rio where they were purportedly living.[33] Forensic experts hired by the History Channel confirmed that the photos were taken in 1975, and asserted that the two men were \\"more than likely\\" the Anglins.[34][35] Other evidence included the deathbed confession of another of the Anglins' 11?siblings, Robert, who told family members in 2010 that he had been in contact with John and Clarence from 1963 until approximately 1987.[36] The film also presented an alternate escape theory, involving the use of an electrical cordwhich had been reported missing from the prison's dock on the night of the escapeas a tow line, attached to a passenger ferry that departed the island shortly after midnight.[37]\\r\\nArt Roderick, a retired Deputy U.S. Marshal working with the Anglin family, called Brizzi's photograph of the two men \\"absolutely the best actionable lead we've had,\\" but added, \\"it could still all be a nice story which isn't true\\"; or the photograph could be a misdirection, aimed at steering the investigation away from the Anglins' actual whereabouts.[36] Michael Dyke, the Deputy Marshal assigned to the case, said Brizzi was \\"a drug smuggler and a conman\\", and was suspicious of his account. An expert working for the U.S. Marshals Service compared measurements of the photo subjects' physical features to those of the Anglin brothers' arrest photos, believed it most likely is a picture of John and Clarence Anglin; although the age and condition of the photo, and the fact that both men were wearing sunglasses, hindered efforts to make a definitive determination.[38]\\r\\nSurviving family members, who said they have heard nothing since Robert lost contact with the brothers in 1987, announced plans to travel to Brazil to conduct a personal search; but Roderick cautioned that they could be arrested by Brazilian authorities, because the Alcatraz escape remains an open Interpol case.[32] According to information obtained by a British newspaper, the FBI was aware of rumors that the Anglins were in Brazil as early as 1965. Agents dispatched to Rio at that time reportedly found no credible evidence that the fugitives were there.[36]\\r\\nIn 2018, the FBI confirmed the existence of a letter, allegedly written by escapee John Anglin, had forced them to reopen the investigation into the case. The FBI examined the letter for fingerprints and DNA, and the handwriting, which produced inconclusive results. The letter, received by the San Francisco Police Department in 2013, opens with:\\r\\nMy name is John Anglin. I escaped from Alcatraz in June 1962 with my brother Clarence and Frank Morris. I'm 83 years old and in bad shape. I have cancer. Yes we all made it that night but barely!\\r\\nThe author of the letter goes on to say Frank Morris died in 2008, and Clarence Anglin died three years later in 2011.[39]\\r\\nJ. Campbell Bruce's 1963 book Escape from Alcatraz documents the 1962 escape, along with other escape attempts over the 29?years that Alcatraz Island served as a prison.[40]\\r\\nThe film Escape from Alcatraz (1979) stars Clint Eastwood, Fred Ward, and Jack Thibeau as Morris, John Anglin, and Clarence Anglin, respectively. West (fictionalized as a character named Charley Butts) was played by Larry Hankin.[41] The film implied that the escape had been successful.[19]","input":"Who was the man who escaped from alcatraz?"},{"output":"Australian football","context":"Sport is an important part of Australian culture dating back to the early colonial period. Cricket, Australian rules football, rugby union and horse racing are among the earliest organised sports in Australia. Sport has shaped the Australian national identity through events such as the Ashes, the Melbourne Cup and the America's Cup.\\r\\nThere are a number of professional sport leagues in Australia, including the Australian Football League (AFL) (Australian rules football), the Big Bash League (BBL) and Sheffield Shield (cricket), the National Basketball League and the Women's National Basketball League, the A-League and the W-League (soccer), the Australian Baseball League, the National Rugby League (rugby league), Super Rugby (rugby union), the ANZ Championship (netball) and the International V8 Supercars Championship (touring car racing). Attendance for the A-League, AFL and NRL over the course of a single season tops six million. Australian football is the most popular sport in Australia, followed by cricket, association football and rugby league.[1]\\r\\nMajor professional sports leagues in Australia are similar to major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada in that they do not practice promotion and relegation, unlike sports leagues in Europe.\\r\\nThe media plays an important part in Australia's sporting landscape, with many sporting events televised or broadcast on radio. The government has anti-siphoning laws to protect free-to-air stations. Beyond televising live events, there are many sport-related television and radio programs, as well as several magazine publications dedicated to sport. Australian sport has also been the subject of Australian-made films such as The Club, Australian Rules, The Final Winter and Footy Legends.\\r\\nAs a nation, Australia has competed in many international events, including the Olympics and Paralympics. The country has also twice hosted the Summer Olympics in Melbourne (1956) and Sydney (2000), as well as the Commonwealth Games on four occasions.\\r\\nThe city of Melbourne is famous for its major sport events and is often considered the 'sporting capital'.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSport came to Australia in 1810 when the first athletics tournament was held; soon after cricket, horse racing and sailing clubs and competitions started. Australia's lower classes would play sports on public holidays, with the upper classes playing more regularly on Saturdays.[3] Sydney was the early hub of sport in the colony.[4] Early forms of football were played there by 1829.[5] Early sport in Australia was played along class lines. In 1835, the British Parliament banned blood sports except fox hunting in a law that was implemented in Australia; this was not taken well in the country as it was seen as an attack on the working classes.[6] By the late 1830s, horse racing was established in New South Wales and other parts of the country, and enjoyed support across class lines. Gambling was part of sport from the time horse racing became an established sport in the colony.[6] Horse racing was also happening in Melbourne at Batman's Hill in 1838, with the first race meeting in Victoria taking place in 1840.[7] Cricket was also underway with the Melbourne Cricket Club founded in 1838.[7][8] Sport was being used during the 1830s, 1840s and 1850s as a form of social integration across classes.[9] Victorian rules football (later known as Australian rules) was codified in 1859.[10][11] Australian football clubs still around in the current Australian Football League were founded by 1858.[8][10][11] The Melbourne Cricket Ground, Australia's largest sporting arena, opened in 1853.[12] The Melbourne Cup was first run in 1861.[13] A rugby union team was established at the University of Sydney in 1864.[13] Regular sport did not begin to be played in South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia until the late 1860s and early 1870s.[4]\\r\\nThe first Australian cricket team to go on tour internationally did so in 1868. The Australian side was an all Aboriginal one and toured England where they played 47 games, where they won 14 games, drew 19 and lost 14.[14]Australia's adoption of sport as a national was pastime was so comprehensive that Anthony Trollope remarked in his book, Australia, published in 1870, \\"The English passion for the amusements which are technically called 'sports', is not a national necessity with the Americans, whereas with the Australians it is almost as much so as home.\\"[15]\\r\\nThe first team formally organised soccer team was formed in Sydney in 1880 and was named the Wanderers.[16][17] Sport was receiving coverage in Australian newspapers by 1876 when a sculling race in England was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald.[4] In 1877, Australia played in the first Test Cricket match against England. In 1882, The Ashes were started following the victory of the Australia national cricket team over England.[13][18] Field hockey teams for men and women were established by 1890.[19] The Sheffield Shield cricket competition was first held in 1891 with New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia participating in the inaugural competition. The remaining states would not participate until much later, with Queensland first participating in 1926ÿ27, Western Australia in 1947ÿ48 and Tasmania in 1982ÿ83.[20][21] In 1897 the Victorian Football League, which later became the AFL the Australian Football League, was founded[13][22] after breaking away from the Victorian Football Association.[22]\\r\\nThe first badminton competition in Australia was played in 1900.[23] The first ice hockey game was played in Melbourne on 12 July 1906 between a local Melbourne team and a team from the crew of the visiting US warship USS Baltimore.[24]\\r\\nMotor racing began in the first years of federation with motorcycle racing beginning at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1901 with automobile motorsport following in 1904 at Aspendale Racecourse in Melbourne. A dedicated race track was added to Aspendale's horse racing track in 1906, although it fell into disuse almost immediately.\\r\\nRugby league has been the overwhelmingly dominant rugby code in Australia since 1908 (this position remains unchallenged to this day). When Messenger and the All Golds returned from Great Britain in 1908, they helped the new clubs adapt to the rules of rugby league prior to the inaugural 1908 NSWRFL season. The Queensland Rugby Football League also formed early in 1908 by seven rugby players who were dissatisfied with the administration of the Queensland Rugby Union.[25] The Australia national rugby union team had their first international test against New Zealand in 1903, and first international tour in 1908, earning their nickname of the Wallabies after two British journalists used it to refer to the team.[26] The team won gold at the 1908 Summer Olympics; however the majority of the squad joined rugby league clubs upon returning to Australia.[27]\\r\\nWomen represented Australia for the first time at the Olympics in 1912.[13] Surfing came to Australia by 1915[13] with the first surf life saving competition being held that year.[28] Les Darcy began his boxing career in 1915, with some of his later fights taking place at Sydney Stadium. The following year, an American promoter encouraged Darcy to go to the United States at a time when Australia was actively recruiting young men for the armed services. Controversy resulted and Darcy died at the age of 21 in the United States. When his body was returned to Australia, 100,000 people attended his Sydney funeral.[29][30][31][32][33] Darcy would remain significant to Australians into the 2000s, when Kevin Rudd mentioned his story.[33]\\r\\nIn 1922, a committee in Australia investigated the benefits of physical education for girls. They came up with several recommendations regarding what sports were and were not appropriate for girls to play based on the level of fitness required. It was determined that for some individual girls that for medical reasons, the girls should probably not be allowed to participate in tennis, netball, lacrosse, golf, hockey, and cricket. Football was completely medically inappropriate for girls to play. It was medically appropriate for all girls to be able to participate in, so long as they were not done in an overly competitive manner, swimming, rowing, cycling and horseback riding.[34] Dick Eve won Australia's first Olympic diving gold medal in 1924.[35] In 1924 the Australian Rugby League Board of Control, later to be known as the Australian Rugby League, was formed to administer the national team (the Kangaroos), and later as the national governing body for the sport of Rugby League. In 1928 the team also adopted the national colours of green and gold for the first time, having previously used blue and maroon, making the Kangaroos the third national sporting body to do so after cricket (from 1899) and the Australian Olympic team (from 1908).[36] Netball Australia was founded in 1927 as the All Australia Women's Basket Ball Association.[13]\\r\\nDuring the 1930s, the playing of sport on Sunday was banned in most country outside South Australia.[37] The Bodyline cricket series between Australia and England took place in 1932ÿ33. The English side were very determined to win, using physical intimidation against Australia to insure it.[38][39] The bowling style used by the team known body-line bowling was devised by Douglas Jardine with advice from Frank Foster in England ahead of the series in order to defeat Australian batsman Donald Bradman. Going into the start of the series, Bill Voce told the media \\"If we don't beat you, we'll knock your bloody heads off.\\" The style of play was such that the Australians contemplated cancelling the series after the Adelaide test.[39][40]\\r\\nFollowing a successful Australian racing career, the race horse Phar Lap went to the United States where he died. There were many conspiracy theories at the time and later that suggested people in the United States poisoned the horse to prevent him from winning.[38]\\r\\nAustralian women's sports had an advantage over many other women's sport organisations around the world in the period after World War II. Women's sports organisations had largely remained intact and were holding competitions during the war period. This structure survived in the post war period. Women's sport were not hurt because of food rationing, petrol rationing, population disbursement, and other issues facing post-war Europe.[41] In September 1949, Australian Canoeing is founded as the Australian Canoe Federation.[42]\\r\\nBy the 1960s, Australia had an international identity as a sport-obsessed country, an identity which was embraced inside the country. This was so well known that in a 1962 edition of Sports Illustrated, Australia was named the most sports obsessed country in the world.[43] In 1967, Australia hosted the second World Netball Championships in Perth.[44] That same year, South Australia became the last state to lift its ban on the playing of sports on Sunday.[37]\\r\\nStarting in the early 1970s, Australian sport underwent a paradigm shift with sponsorship becoming one of the fundamental drivers of earnings for Australian sport on amateur and professional levels. By the mid-1980s, the need for the ability to acquire sponsorship dollars in sport was so great that job applicants for sport administrator positions were expected to be able to demonstrate an ability to get it.[45]\\r\\nDuring the 1970s, Australia was being routinely defeated in major international competitions as Eastern Bloc countries enjoyed strong government support for sport. The Liberal governments at the time were opposed to similar intervention in Australia's sporting system as they felt it would be government intrusion into an important component of Australian life.[46] In the 1974 elections, several Australian sporting competitors endorsed the Liberal party in advertisements that ran on television. Competitors involved included Ron Barassi, NSWRL player Johnny Raper and horse trainer Tommie Smith.[47] That year, the Australian team qualified for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, the first successful qualification to the FIFA World Cup in the country's history after failing to qualify to the 1966 and 1970 tournaments. It would prove to be the only appearance for the Australian team for more than three decades.[16]\\r\\nThe regional football code divide in Australia was still present in the 1980s, with rugby league football being the dominant code in Queensland, ACT and New South Wales while Australian rules football dominated in the rest of the country. When codes went outside of their traditional geographic home, they had little success in gaining new fans and participants.[20] The Australian Institute of Sport was founded in 1981.[48] In the lead up to and during the 1982 Commonwealth Games, the police were called upon to stop protests by Aboriginal land rights activists who staged protests timed with the event in order to politicise the event.[49] Australia had competitors in the America's Cup yacht race for a number of years. Going into the 1983 race, the Australian media was not that interested in the race as they expected a similar result and in the media lead-up to the event, made it out to be a race for rich people. This lack of interest continued throughout the early races. Near the end, when Australia finally appeared poised to win it, millions of Australians turned on their television to watch the Australia II win the competition.[50] That year, the Liberals used Australian tennis star John Newcombe and race car drivers Peter Brock and Alan Jones in their political advertising.[51] Athletes would again be used, this time by the Labor Party, in the 1989 elections.[51] During the 1980s, Australian soccer players began to start playing regularly in overseas professional leagues, with the most successful player of the decade being Craig Johnston who scored a goal in the 1986 F.A. Cup Final for Liverpool.[16] During the 1980s, the federal government created a number of sport programs including Aussie Sports and Active Australia.[52] The Australia women's national field hockey team began their run as one of the top teams in the world in 1985, a place they would hold until 2000.[19]\\r\\nIn 1990, the Victorian Football League changed its name to the Australian Football League. During the 1990s, soccer in Australia faced a challenge in attracting youth players because of the ethnic nature of the sport at the highest levels of national competition. The sport's governing body made an effort to make the game less ethnically oriented. At the same time, rival football codes were intentionally trying to bring in ethnic participants in order to expand their youth playing base.[53] Doping became a concern during the 1980s and more active steps were taken to combat it in Australia in the early 1990s. In 1990, the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 was passed and took control of doping test away from the Australian Sport Commission and put it into the hands of an independent doping control agency as of 17 February 1991.[54]\\r\\nIn 2006, Melbourne hosted the 2006 Commonwealth Games.[55] Later that year, the Australian team competed in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, their second FIFA World Cup appearance after 32 years of failing to qualify for the tournament.[56]\\r\\nIn 2012, the Australian Rugby League Commission was formed, bringing to an end the involvement of News Limited in the administration of Rugby League and the media companies' conflict of interests in the sport, finally concluding the fall-out from the Super League war in the 1990s.[57] From 2008 until 2013, the Australian thoroughbred mare Black Caviar was undefeated in 25 races, a record not equaled in over 100 years.[58] Notable wins include the 2012 Diamond Jubilee Stakes, as well as being named the top sprinter from 2010 to 2012 in the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings and entering the Australian Racing Hall of Fame.\\r\\nThe organisation of sport in Australia has been largely determined by its Federal system of government ÿ Australian Government and six states and two territories governments and local governments.[59]\\r\\nState and Territory governments have a department with responsibility for sport and recreation. These departments provide assistance to state sports organisations, develop and manage sporting facilities, provide financial assistance for major sporting events and develop policies to assist sports across their state or territory. Each Australian State and Territory has established its own institute/academy of sport ÿ ACT Academy of Sport (established 1989), New South Wales Institute of Sport (1996), Northern Territory Institute of Sport (1996), Queensland Academy of Sport (1991), South Australian Sports Institute (1982), Tasmanian Institute of Sport (1985), Victorian Institute of Sport (1990) and Western Australian Institute of Sport (1984).[60]\\r\\nThere are 560 local councils across Australia. Local governments generally focus on the provision of facilities such as swimming pools, sporting fields, stadiums and tennis courts.[61]\\r\\nGovernment involvement in sport up until the 1970s was fairly limited with local governments playing a major role through the provision of sporting facilities.[59] However, this changed over the next two decades with an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey in 2001ÿ2002 finding that approximately $2 billion was spent on sport by three levels of government ÿ 10 per cent from the Australian Government, 40 per cent from state and territory governments, and the remaining 50 per cent from local government.[62] State, territory and local government spending was predominantly directed to facilities and their upkeep.[62] In 1973, the Recreation Minister's Council was established to provide a forum for Australian Government and State and Territory Minister's responsible for sport and recreation to discuss matters of interest.[59] With government's taking an increased involvement in sport, it became the Sport and Recreation Minister's Council.[59] More recently is referred to as Meeting of Sport and Recreation Ministers.[63] The Meeting is assisted by the Committee of Australian Sport and Recreation Officials (CASRO) previously called the Standing Committee on Sport and Recreation (SCORS).[63] The Meeting works cooperatively on issues such as match fixing, sport participation and water safety.[64] In 2011, Minister's signed the National Sport and Active Recreation Policy Framework.[65] The framework \\"provides a mechanism for the achievement of national goals for sport and active recreation, sets out agreed roles and responsibilities of governments and their expectations of sport and active recreation partners.\\" [65] In 1993, National Elite Sports Council was established to provide a forum for communication, issues management and national program coordination across the high performance in Australia.[60] It includes representatives from AIS, State Institute /Academies, Australian Olympic Committee, Australian Paralympic Committee, and the Australian Commonwealth Games Association.[66][67] In 2011, National Institute System Intergovernmental Agreement provides \\"guidance on how the sector will operate, with a principal focus on the delivery of the high performance plans of national sporting organisations.\\" [68]\\r\\nThe Australian government provided small amounts of funding in the 1950s and 1960s through the support of the National Fitness Council and international sporting teams such as the Australian Olympic team.[59] The Australian Government's serious involvement and investment into sport came with it establishing the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) in 1981.[59] AIS was set up to improve Australia's performances in international sport which had started to decline in the 1960s and 1970s culminating in Australia winning no gold medals at the 1976 Montreal Olympics.[60] In 1985, the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) was established to improve the Australian Government's administration of sport in terms of funding, participation and elite sport.[60] The 1989 Senate Inquiry into drugs in sport resulted in the establishment of the Australian Sport Drug Agency (now called Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA)) in 1990 to manage Australia's anti-doping program.[60]\\r\\nThe highest rates of participation for Australian sport and recreation are informal, non-organised sports with bike riding, skateboarding, rollerblading or riding a scooter topping the list of activities for children, with 66% of all boys bike riding and 55.9% of all boys skateboarding, rollerblading or riding a scooter in 2009 and 2010. Girls also participated in these activities at high rates with 54.4% of them doing bike riding and 42.4% skateboarding, rollerblading or riding a scooter. Other sports popular for Australian girls include dancing, which had 26.3% participation, swimming with 19.8% participation and netball at 17%. For boys, the other popular sports for participation included soccer with a rate of participation of 19.9%, swimming with a participation rate of 17.2%, Australian rules at 16%.[69]\\r\\nParticipation rates for adults in Australia were much lower than that of Australian children. For adult women in Australia, the number one sport activity they participate in is walking with 30% having done this in 2009 and 2010. The second most popular form of exercise and sport was Aerobics/fitness/gym with a rate of 16.7%. The third most popular for adult women was swimming and diving with 8.4%. For men, the most popular sport activity was also walking with a participation rate of 15.6%. This was followed by Aerobics/fitness/gym with 11.2%. The third most popular sport for adult males was cycling/BMXing with a participation rate of 8.2%.[69]\\r\\nThere are 34,000 athletes, officials and coaches currently registered with the Athletics Australia.[70] A 2007 estimate claimed that Australian football had 615,549 participants,[71] Basketball has become one of the most popular participation sports in Australia. In Victoria, and Melbourne, particularly, it has more participants than any other sport.[72][73][74] Australia's warm climate and long coastline of sandy beaches and rolling waves provide ideal conditions for water sports such as swimming. The majority of Australians live in cities or towns on or near the coast, and so beaches are a place that millions of Australians visit regularly.[75]\\r\\nAccording to the National Cricket Census, a record 1,311,184 people played Cricket across Australia in 2015-16, an 8.5 percent increase on 2014-15 ÿ placing cricket at No.1 as the current top participation sport in Australia. Women participation also reached record figures in 2015-16, growing nine percent to 314,936 players. Club and community participation jumped 9.5 percent to 454,657 during the same period, with juniors aged 512 years making up 59.4 percent of all 201516 participants.[76]\\r\\nAmateur sport in Australia follows a corporate management system, with the national tier composed of national sport organisations that support and fund elite sport development. These organisations include the Australian Institute of Sport and the Australian Sports Commission. Below them is the state level, which includes state sporting organisations, state institute of sport and state departments of sport. The last level is district/regional associations and local clubs and community sports along with local government.[77] At the national level, the national sport organisations govern most sports in Australia, with over 120 different national sports organisation overseeing sport in Australia.[78][79] The role of government in this structure is important[77][80] as government funding for most sport in Australia comes from the national government, state and territory governments, and local governments. In the late 1990s, government support for sport was double that of public non-financial corporations.[80]\\r\\nAmateur sport was transformed in Australia in the 1980s with the creation of the Australian Institute of Sport. The Institute, formally opened by Malcolm Fraser in 1981, was designed to make Australian amateur sport at major world competitions, like the Olympics, competitive with the rest of the world and increase the number of medals won by the country.[81] A few years later, in 1984, the Australian Sports Commission was created to better address the distribution of funds to support sport.[82] It had a budget of A$109 million in 2000.[52] By 2009, the Australian Sports Commission had a budget of A$150 million, up from A$5 million when it first was created.[82]\\r\\nAmateur sport has been able to draw large audiences. In the 1950s, 120,000 fans would go to the MCG to watch major athletics events.[83]\\r\\nAustralian amateur sport has dealt with financial problems. In the 2000s, Athletics Australia was facing duel problems of financial problems and failure for the sport to consistently medal at major international sporting events compared to other sports and their representative organisations like Swimming Australia and Rowing Australia.[84]\\r\\nAustralian sport fans have historically attended events in large numbers, dating back to the country's early history. An early football game played in Melbourne in 1858 had 2,000 spectators.[85] By 1897, tens of thousands of spectators attended an early Australian rules football match at a time when top level soccer matches in England would draw six thousand fans. A finals match between the Carlton Football Club and Collingwood in 1938 drew 96,834 fans.[86] In 1909, at a time when rugby union had not yet become professionalised, 52,000 people in Sydney attended a game between New South Wales and New Zealand. The spectators accounted for 10% of the total population of Sydney at the time.[87] A world record was set for cricket attendance on 30 December 1932 when 63,993 fans watched England take on Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.[88]\\r\\nTotal average game attendance for the Australian Football League and the National Rugby League increased between 1970 and 2000, with the AFL going from an average attendance of 24,344 people per match in 1970 to 27,325 by 1980 to 25,238 in 1990 and 34,094 by 2000. The National Rugby League had an average per game attendance of 11,990 in 1970, saw a decrease in 1980 to 10,860 but increased to 12,073 by 1990 and improved on that to 14,043 by 2000. Founded later, the National Basketball League had an average per game attendance of 1,158 in 1985, increased this to 4,551 by 1990, and kept attendance steady with 4,636 average fans per game in 2000.[89]\\r\\nIn March 1999, 104,000 fans attended a double header match in the National Rugby League at Stadium Australia four days after the venue formally opened.[90] In 2000, during the soccer gold medal match between Cameroon and Spain, 114,000 fans watched the game live inside Stadium Australia.[91] In the 2006ÿ07 season, the A-League Melbourne Victory averaged 27,728 people to their home matches throughout the season. The 2009ÿ10 regular season was considerably lower.[92] In 2011, the Australian Football League had a cumulative attendance of 7,139,272, a record for the competition and an average attendance of 36,425.[93] Spectator numbers dropped since then and in 2013 average attendance fell below that of the leading domestic motor racing series International V8 Supercars Championship. In 2010, the National Rugby League's premiership set a record for regular season attendance to NRL matches.[94]\\r\\nThe Big Bash League (BBL) was established in 2011. The first season attracted an average of 18,021 spectators per match. In the 2014-15 season, the average attendance for each match was 23,590 with the Adelaide Strikers attracting a record average home crowd of 36,023 spectators each game.[95][96] The 2015 Cricket World Cup final was played in front of 93,013 spectators, a record crowd for a day of cricket in Australia. BBL in its sixth season in 2016ÿ17, drew an average crowd in excess of 30,000 for the first time in history, with overall count crossing 1 million for 35 matches. It is now placed sixth in the list of most attended sports leagues with respect to average crowd per match.\\r\\nMedia coverage of Australian sport and athletes predates 1876. The first all Australian sport publication, The Referee, was first published in 1886 in Sydney.[111] The major newspapers for sport coverage in the country include the Herald Sun and The West Australian.[111]\\r\\nThere is a long history of television coverage of sports in Australia. From 1957 to 2001, the Seven Network was the network for the Australian Football League. The only year that Seven was not the network for the league was in 1987 when the AFL was on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). An exclusive deal was agreed upon by Seven in 1976 for a five-year deal worth A$3 million.[112]\\r\\nWorld Series Cricket was a break away professional cricket competition staged between 1977 and 1979 and organised by Kerry Packer for his TV network, Nine. The matches ran in opposition to international cricket. It drastically changed the nature of cricket and its influence continues to be felt today.[113]\\r\\nNot all sports have had favourable deals with networks. The first television offer for the National Basketball League was worth A$1 in an offered made by Seven that the league accepted. The deal made by Ten Network to the New South Wales Rugby League was worth considerably more, worth A$48 million for a five-year deal that also included broadcasting rights for the State of Origin and the Australia national rugby league team. This deal was terminated early because the network could not afford to pay out.[114]\\r\\nThe 1967 NSWRFL season's grand final became the first football grand final of any code to be televised live in Australia. The Nine Network had paid $5,000 for the broadcasting rights.[115]\\r\\nSBS and FoxSports are two of the most important television networks in Australia in terms of covering all Australian sports, not just the popular professional leagues.[111] Administrators for less popular spectator sports, such as basketball and netball, believe that getting additional television and newspaper coverage is fundamental for the growth and success of their sports going forward.[111]\\r\\nAnti-siphoning laws in Australia regulate the media companies' access to significant sporting events. In 1992, when the country experienced growth in paid-subscription media, the Parliament of Australia enacted the Broadcasting Services Act that gave free-to-air broadcasters preferential access to acquire broadcasting rights to sporting events. The anti-siphoning list is a list of major sporting events that the Parliament of Australia has decided must be available for all Australians to see free of charge and cannot be \\"siphoned off\\" to pay TV where people are forced to pay to see them. The current anti-siphoning list came into effect in 2006 and expires 31 December 2010. The Minister for Communications can add or remove events from the list at his discretion. There are currently ten sports on the anti-siphoning list plus the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. Events on the anti-siphoning list are delisted 12 weeks before they start to ensure pay TV broadcasters have reasonable access to listed events, if free-to-air broadcasters decide not to purchase the broadcast rights for a particular event. Any rights to listed sporting events that are not acquired by free-to-air broadcasters are available to pay TV. For multi-round events where it is simply not possible for free-to-air networks to broadcast all matches within the event (e.g. the Australian Open) complementary coverage is available on pay television. The Federal Government is obliged by legislation to conduct a review of the list before the end of 2009. The current anti-siphoning list requires showing listed sports on the broadcaster's main channel.[116]\\r\\nRugby league, which includes NRL, State of Origin and national team matches, had the highest aggregate television ratings of any sport in 2009[117] and 2010.[118] Also, in a world first, the Nine Network broadcast free-to-air the first match of the 2010 State of Origin series live in 3D in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria.[119][120]\\r\\nCricket Australia announced an unprecedented $590 million deal with free-to-air television networks Nine and Ten in 2013 to broadcast the sport - a 118 per cent increase on the previous five-year contract.[121]\\r\\nBBL games are currently broadcast in Australia by the free-to-air Network Ten. In 2013 Ten paid $100 million for BBL rights over five years, marking the channel's first foray in elite cricket coverage.[122] Fox Sports had previously covered the Big Bash League.\\r\\nNetwork Tens BBL coverage has become a regular feature of Australian summers and last season attracted an average audience of more than 943,000 people nationally in 2014ÿ15 season, including a peak audience of 1.9 million viewers for the final between the Perth Scorchers and Sydney Sixers.[123]\\r\\nThere are a number of Australian sport films. They include The Club. The film was based on a play produced in 1977, in Melbourne. It has been in the senior English syllabi for four Australian states for many years.[124] The film was written by David Williamson, directed by Bruce Beresford and starring John Howard, Jack Thompson, Graham Kennedy and Frank Wilson.[125] Another Australian sport film is The Final Winter, released in 2007. It was directed by Brian Andrews and Jane Forrest and produced by Anthony Coffee, and Michelle Russell, while independently produced it is being distributed by Paramount Pictures. It was written by Matthew Nable who also starred as the lead role 'Grub' Henderson. The film, which earned praise from critics,[126] focuses around Grub who is the captain of the Newtown Jets football team in the early 1980s and his determination to stand for what rugby league traditionally stood for while dealing with his own identity crisis.[127] Other Australian sport films include Australian Rules and Footy Legends.[128][129]\\r\\nSport is popular on the radio. This Sporting Life was a culturally iconic Triple J radio comedy program created by actor-writer comedians John Doyle and Greig Pickhaver, who performed as their characters Roy and HG. Broadcast from 1986 to 2008, it was one of the longest-running, most popular and most successful radio comedy programs of the post-television era in Australia. It was the longest-running show in Triple J's programming history and commanded a large and dedicated nationwide audience throughout its 22-year run.[130] 2KY is a commercial radio station based in Sydney, broadcasting throughout New South Wales and Canberra on a network of over 140 narrowcast transmitters as well as the main 1017 AM frequency in Sydney. 2KY broadcasts live commentary of thoroughbred, harness and greyhound racing. Over 1500 races are covered each week, including the pre and post race form and TAB betting information.[131]\\r\\nThere are a number of Australian sport magazines. One is the AFL Record. The magazine is published in a sports magazine style format. Eight different versions, one for each game, are published for each weekly round, 60,000 copies in total, and Roy Morgan Research estimates that the Record has a weekly readership of over 200,000.[132] As of 2009, the week's records are published and are able to be viewed in an online magazine format.[133] Another Australian sporting magazine is Australia's Surfing Life, a monthly magazine about surfing published in Australia. It features articles about surf trips in Australia and overseas, surfing technique, board design and wetsuits. The magazine was founded in 1985.[134]\\r\\nAustralia participate in many international competitions, such as the Olympics, Commonwealth Games, Cricket World Cup, Rugby World Cup, Rugby League World Cup, FIFA World Cup, the Basketball World Cup for both men and women, Netball World Cup, World Baseball Classic and the Hockey World Cup.\\r\\nThe Australian national cricket team have participated in every edition of the Cricket World Cup. Australia have been very successful in the event, winning the tournament five times, the record number.[135]\\r\\nThe Australian national Rugby league team have also participated in every edition of the Rugby League World Cup. Australia have been very successful in the event, winning the tournament 10 times, the record number.[136]\\r\\nThe Australian national Rugby union team have participated in every Rugby World Cup. Australia have been very successful in the tournament, winning it two times[137] despite it not being a major sport in Australia.\\r\\nAustralia's women have repeatedly won at the highest level. The Australian national netball team have won the Netball World Cup a record 11 times.[138] The Australian women's national cricket team have won the Women's Cricket World Cup a record five times.[139] The Australian women's national field hockey team have won the Gold Medal at the Olympics and the Women's Hockey World Cup three and two times respectively.[140][141]\\r\\nThe Australia women's national basketball team, known as the Opals, regularly compete well against the world elite at the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup, having won the event in 2006 and finishing third three times, and at the Summer Olympics Basketball Tournament, where they have won silver medals three times and bronze medals twice.[142]\\r\\nThe Australia national soccer team have appeared at the FIFA World Cup in 1974, 2006, 2010 and 2014. At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the Socceroos surprised many by reaching the Round of 16, losing 1ÿ0 in injury time to the eventual champions, Italy.[143] They also hold the unusual distinction of having won continental soccer championships of two confederations - Oceania's OFC Nations Cup four times between 1980 and 2004 and, after moving to the Asian Football Confederation in 2005, the AFC Asian Cup in 2015. The Australia women's national soccer team, the Matildas, have appeared in all FIFA Women's World Cups except the first in 1991. They have advanced past the group stage in each of the last three of the competition (2007, 2011 and 2015), losing in the quarter-finals each time. In 2015, they became the first senior Australian national team of either sex to win a World Cup knockout stage match, specifically in the round of 16, newly instituted for the Women's World Cup in that year. The Matildas have also enjoyed success at the AFC Women's Asian Cup, advancing at least to the semi-finals in all four competitions since joining the AFC in 2006 and winning in 2010.\\r\\nAustralia has also hosted a number of major international sporting events, including the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 2000 Summer Olympics. The country also regularly hosts a major tennis Grand Slam event, the Australian Open, an FIA Formula One World Championship round (Australian Grand Prix), motorcycle Moto GP round (Australian motorcycle Grand Prix), as well as rounds of the Superbike World Championship, World Rally Championship alongside major domestically created, internationally recognised events including the Melbourne Cup and the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race.[38]\\r\\nAustralia has hosted the 1992 Cricket World Cup and the 2015 Cricket World Cup along with New Zealand.[135] The 2015 Cricket World Cup generated more than A$1.1 billion in direct spending, created the equivalent of 8,320 full-time jobs, and had a total of 2 million bed nights across the two host countries.[144] Australia has also hosted the 2003 Rugby World Cup, with the event generating around A$1 billion in economic activity while bringing in 2 million visitors to the country.[145]\\r\\nThe 1868 Aboriginal cricket tour of England was the first tour by any sports team from Australia.[146] [147]\\r\\nThe Olympic movement in Australia started out during the 1900s and 1910s in Australia. The first organisations for the Olympics in Australia came out of the athletics governance system and resulted in the creation of state based Olympic committees. The first national governing body for Australian Olympics was created in 1914 and was a joint effort with New Zealand though New Zealand was a less than able partner. The movement in Australia then stagnated as a result of the Great War. The New Zealand and Australian organisation was disbanded and an Australian only national organisation was founded in 1920 called the Australian Olympic Federation. The early goals of the organisation were to ratify team selection and to fundraise to assist Olympians in paying for their travel to compete at the Games. By the 1980s, the organisation had issues on the international level as the IOC wanted them to re-structure; until this time, the organisation followed governance models similar to that of other Australian sporting organisations with a federated model of governance. Changes were made the organisation ended up with an executive board with a president, two vice presidents, a secretary general and a 14-member executive board which had 10 elected members, 4 IOC members and 2 members of the Athlete's Commission.[148]\\r\\nAustralia has hosted the Olympics twice, in 1956 in Melbourne and in 2000 in Sydney. These were the first Games hosted in the southern hemisphere.[149][150][151]\\r\\nAustralia has been active influential in the Olympic movement, with four Australian representatives who are members of the International Olympic Committee.[148]\\r\\nThe government has provided monetary support for the Olympics. In the lead up to the 1924 Games, they provided 3,000 pounds and in 1936 provided 2,000 pounds. This support was seen as a way of supporting national identity, but no formal system existed for the funding wider sport at the time.[152]\\r\\nThe 1956 Games were the first time Australia had an Equestrian competitor when Victorian Ernie Barker competed.[151] Australia has generally been a world power in Olympic swimming since the 1956 Melbourne Olympics: swimmers like Shane Gould, Dawn Fraser, Ian Thorpe and Kieren Perkins have taken multiple gold medals.[153]\\r\\nAustralia performed relatively poorly at the 1976 Summer Olympics. This upset the nation as it challenged a fundamental part of Australian identity. The following Olympics, the 1980 Summer Olympics, some Australian sports sat out as part of a boycott[48][154] and the country earned only nine medals, two of them gold, in Moscow.[155] To prevent a recurrence of this, the Australian Institute of Sport was created to help improve Australia's medal tally at the Games.[155][154]\\r\\nChannel Seven had exclusive Australian free-to-air, pay television, online and mobile telephone broadcast rights to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The live telecast of the 2008 Summer Olympics was shared by the Seven Network and SBS Television. Seven broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies and mainstream sports, including swimming, athletics, rowing, cycling and gymnastics. In contrast, SBS TV provided complementary coverage focused on long-form events such as soccer, road cycling, volleyball and table tennis.[156]\\r\\nAustralia has attended every Summer Paralympics and hosted the 2000 Sydney Games. Australia sent a delegation of 170 athletes to compete at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing,[157] and a team of 11 competitors to compete in two disciplines at the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.[158] A team of 161 members was sent to the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London.[159]\\r\\nAustralians take the Commonwealth Games seriously because, on one level of national thinking, the event offers the country an opportunity to prove they are superior to the \\"original country\\", the United Kingdom.[19][160][161][162] By the 1938 British Empire Games, Australia's combined medal total was already greater than that of the Home Nations tallies combined. Australia would go on to beat England in total medals at the Commonwealth Games in 1950, 1962, 1970, 1974 and 1982.[19] This rivalry with England continues to be an important component of the games for the country.[161][162]","input":"What is the most popular sport played in australia?"},{"output":"March 1959","context":"The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is one of the 20th century's most famous and distinctive buildings.[3]\\r\\nDesigned by Danish architect J?rn Utzon, the building was formally opened on 20 October 1973[4] after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.[5]\\r\\nThe building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove, adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, and close by the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\\r\\nThough its name suggests a single venue, the building comprises multiple performance venues which together host well over 1,500 performances annually, attended by more than 1.2?million people.[6] Performances are presented by numerous performing artists, including three resident companies: Opera Australia, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia, more than eight million people visit the site annually, and approximately 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year.[7] The building is managed by the Sydney Opera House Trust, an agency of the New South Wales State Government.\\r\\nOn 28 June 2007, the Sydney Opera House became a UNESCO World Heritage Site;[8] having been listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate since 1980, the National Trust of Australia register since 1983, the City of Sydney Heritage Inventory since 2000, the New South Wales State Heritage Register since 2003, and the Australian National Heritage List since 2005.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe facility features a modern expressionist design, with a series of large precast concrete \\"shells\\",[11] each composed of sections of a sphere of 75.2 metres (246?ft 8.6?in) radius,[12] forming the roofs of the structure, set on a monumental podium. The building covers 1.8 hectares (4.4 acres) of land and is 183?m (600?ft) long and 120?m (394?ft) wide at its widest point. It is supported on 588 concrete piers sunk as much as 25?m (82?ft) below sea level.\\r\\nAlthough the roof structures are commonly referred to as \\"shells\\" (as in this article), they are precast concrete panels supported by precast concrete ribs, not shells in a strictly structural sense.[13] Though the shells appear uniformly white from a distance, they actually feature a subtle chevron pattern composed of 1,056,006 tiles in two colours: glossy white and matte cream. The tiles were manufactured by the Swedish company H?gan?s AB which generally produced stoneware tiles for the paper-mill industry.[14]\\r\\nApart from the tile of the shells and the glass curtain walls of the foyer spaces, the building's exterior is largely clad with aggregate panels composed of pink granite quarried at Tarana. Significant interior surface treatments also include off-form concrete, Australian white birch plywood supplied from Wauchope in northern New South Wales, and brush box glulam.[15]\\r\\nOf the two larger spaces, the Concert Hall is in the western group of shells, the Joan Sutherland Theatre in the eastern group. The scale of the shells was chosen to reflect the internal height requirements, with low entrance spaces, rising over the seating areas up to the high stage towers. The smaller venues (the Drama Theatre, the Playhouse and the Studio) are within the podium, beneath the Concert Hall. A smaller group of shells set to the western side of the Monumental Steps houses the Bennelong Restaurant. The podium is surrounded by substantial open public spaces, and the large stone-paved forecourt area with the adjacent monumental steps is regularly used as a performance space.\\r\\nThe Sydney Opera House includes a number of performance venues:[16]\\r\\nOther areas (for example the northern and western foyers) are also used for performances on an occasional basis. Venues are also used for conferences, ceremonies and social functions.\\r\\nThe building also houses a recording studio, cafes, restaurants, bars and retail outlets. Guided tours are available, including a frequent tour of the front-of-house spaces, and a daily backstage tour that takes visitors backstage to see areas normally reserved for performers and crew members.\\r\\nPlanning began in the late 1940s, when Eugene Goossens, the Director of the NSW State Conservatorium of Music, lobbied for a suitable venue for large theatrical productions. The normal venue for such productions, the Sydney Town Hall, was not considered large enough. By 1954, Goossens succeeded in gaining the support of NSW Premier Joseph Cahill, who called for designs for a dedicated opera house. It was also Goossens who insisted that Bennelong Point be the site: Cahill had wanted it to be on or near Wynyard Railway Station in the northwest of the CBD.[21]\\r\\nAn international design competition was launched by Cahill on 13 September 1955 and received 233 entries, representing architects from 32 countries. The criteria specified a large hall seating 3,000 and a small hall for 1,200 people, each to be designed for different uses, including full-scale operas, orchestral and choral concerts, mass meetings, lectures, ballet performances and other presentations.[22]\\r\\nThe winner, announced in 1957, was J?rn Utzon, a Danish architect. According to legend the Utzon design was rescued from a final cut of 30 \\"rejects\\" by the noted Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen. The runner-up was an entry by firm GBQC of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The grand prize was 5,000 Australian pounds.[23] Utzon visited Sydney in 1957 to help supervise the project.[24] His office moved to Palm Beach, Sydney in February 1963.[25]\\r\\nUtzon received the Pritzker Architecture Prize, architecture's highest honour, in 2003.[26] The Pritzker Prize citation read:\\r\\nThere is no doubt that the Sydney Opera House is his masterpiece. It is one of the great iconic buildings of the 20th century, an image of great beauty that has become known throughout the world ÿ a symbol for not only a city, but a whole country and continent.\\r\\nThe Fort Macquarie Tram Depot, occupying the site at the time of these plans, was demolished in 1958 and construction began in March 1959. It was built in three stages: stage I (1959ÿ1963) consisted of building the upper podium; stage II (1963ÿ1967) the construction of the outer shells; stage III (1967ÿ1973) interior design and construction.\\r\\nStage I commenced on 2 March 1959 with the construction firm Civil & Civic, monitored by the engineers Ove Arup and Partners.[27] The government had pushed for work to begin early, fearing that funding, or public opinion, might turn against them. However, Utzon had still not completed the final designs. Major structural issues still remained unresolved. By 23 January 1961, work was running 47 weeks behind,[27] mainly because of unexpected difficulties (inclement weather, unexpected difficulty diverting stormwater, construction beginning before proper construction drawings had been prepared, changes of original contract documents). Work on the podium was finally completed in February 1963. The forced early start led to significant later problems, not least of which was the fact that the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof structure, and had to be re-built.[28]\\r\\nThe shells of the competition entry were originally of undefined geometry,[29] but, early in the design process, the \\"shells\\" were perceived as a series of parabolas supported by precast concrete ribs. However, engineers Ove Arup and Partners were unable to find an acceptable solution to constructing them. The formwork for using in-situ concrete would have been prohibitively expensive, and, because there was no repetition in any of the roof forms, the construction of precast concrete for each individual section would possibly have been even more expensive.\\r\\nFrom 1957 to 1963, the design team went through at least 12 iterations of the form of the shells trying to find an economically acceptable form (including schemes with parabolas, circular ribs and ellipsoids) before a workable solution was completed. The design work on the shells involved one of the earliest uses of computers in structural analysis, to understand the complex forces to which the shells would be subjected.[30] The computer system was also used in the assembly of the arches. The pins in the arches were surveyed at the end of each day, and the information was entered into the computer so the next arch could be properly placed the following day. In mid-1961, the design team found a solution to the problem: the shells all being created as sections from a sphere. This solution allows arches of varying length to be cast in a common mould, and a number of arch segments of common length to be placed adjacent to one another, to form a spherical section. With whom exactly this solution originated has been the subject of some controversy. It was originally credited to Utzon. Ove Arup's letter to Ashworth, a member of the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee, states: \\"Utzon came up with an idea of making all the shells of uniform curvature throughout in both directions.\\"[31] Peter Jones, the author of Ove Arup's biography, states that \\"the architect and his supporters alike claimed to recall the precise eureka moment ...?; the engineers and some of their associates, with equal conviction, recall discussion in both central London and at Ove's house.\\"\\r\\nHe goes on to claim that \\"the existing evidence shows that Arup's canvassed several possibilities for the geometry of the shells, from parabolas to ellipsoids and spheres.\\"[30] Yuzo Mikami, a member of the design team, presents an opposite view in his book on the project, Utzon's Sphere.[32][33] It is unlikely that the truth will ever be categorically known, but there is a clear consensus that the design team worked very well indeed for the first part of the project and that Utzon, Arup, and Ronald Jenkins (partner of Ove Arup and Partners responsible for the Opera House project) all played a very significant part in the design development.[34]\\r\\nAs Peter Murray states in The Saga of the Sydney Opera House:[28]\\r\\n... the two menand their teamsenjoyed a collaboration that was remarkable in its fruitfulness and, despite many traumas, was seen by most of those involved in the project as a high point of architect/engineer collaboration.\\r\\nThe design of the roof was tested on scale models in wind tunnels at University of Southampton and later NPL in order to establish the wind-pressure distribution around the roof shape in very high winds, which helped in the design of the roof tiles and their fixtures.[35][36]\\r\\nThe shells were constructed by Hornibrook Group Pty Ltd,[37] who were also responsible for construction in Stage III. Hornibrook manufactured the 2400 precast ribs and 4000 roof panels in an on-site factory and also developed the construction processes.[28] The achievement of this solution avoided the need for expensive formwork construction by allowing the use of precast units (it also allowed the roof tiles to be prefabricated in sheets on the ground, instead of being stuck on individually at height). Ove Arup and Partners' site engineer supervised the construction of the shells, which used an innovative adjustable steel-trussed \\"erection arch\\" to support the different roofs before completion. On 6 April 1962, it was estimated that the Opera House would be completed between August 1964 and March 1965.\\r\\nStage III, the interiors, started with Utzon moving his entire office to Sydney in February 1963. However, there was a change of government in 1965, and the new Robert Askin government declared the project under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works. Due to the Ministry's criticism of the project's costs and time,[38] along with their impression of Utzon's designs being impractical, this ultimately led to his resignation in 1966 (see below).\\r\\nThe cost of the project so far, even in October 1966, was still only $22.9?million,[39] less than a quarter of the final $102?million cost. However, the projected costs for the design were at this stage much more significant.\\r\\nThe second stage of construction was progressing toward completion when Utzon resigned. His position was principally taken over by Peter Hall, who became largely responsible for the interior design. Other persons appointed that same year to replace Utzon were E. H. Farmer as government architect, D. S. Littlemore and Lionel Todd.\\r\\nFollowing Utzon's resignation, the acoustic advisor, Lothar Cremer, confirmed to the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC) that Utzon's original acoustic design allowed for only 2000 seats in the main hall and further stated that increasing the number of seats to 3000 as specified in the brief would be disastrous for the acoustics. According to Peter Jones, the stage designer, Martin Carr, criticised the \\"shape, height and width of the stage, the physical facilities for artists, the location of the dressing rooms, the widths of doors and lifts, and the location of lighting switchboards.\\"[40]\\r\\nThe Opera House was formally completed in 1973, having cost $102?million.[43] H.R. \\"Sam\\" Hoare, the Hornibrook director in charge of the project, provided the following approximations in 1973: Stage I: podium Civil & Civic Pty Ltd approximately $5.5m. Stage II: roof shells M.R. Hornibrook (NSW) Pty Ltd approximately $12.5m. Stage III: completion The Hornibrook Group $56.5m. Separate contracts: stage equipment, stage lighting and organ $9.0m. Fees and other costs: $16.5m.\\r\\nThe original cost and scheduling estimates in 1957 projected a cost of S3,500,000 ($7?million) and completion date of 26 January 1963 (Australia Day).[30] In reality, the project was completed ten years late and 1,357% over budget in real terms.\\r\\nBefore the Sydney Opera House competition, J?rn Utzon had won seven of the 18 competitions he had entered but had never seen any of his designs built.[44] Utzon's submitted concept for the Sydney Opera House was almost universally admired and considered groundbreaking. The Assessors Report of January 1957, stated:\\r\\nThe drawings submitted for this scheme are simple to the point of being diagrammatic. Nevertheless, as we have returned again and again to the study of these drawings, we are convinced that they present a concept of an Opera House which is capable of becoming one of the great buildings of the world.\\r\\nFor the first stage, Utzon worked successfully with the rest of the design team and the client, but, as the project progressed, the Cahill government insisted on progressive revisions. They also did not fully appreciate the costs or work involved in design and construction. Tensions between the client and the design team grew further when an early start to construction was demanded despite an incomplete design. This resulted in a continuing series of delays and setbacks while various technical engineering issues were being refined. The building was unique, and the problems with the design issues and cost increases were exacerbated by commencement of work before the completion of the final plans.\\r\\nAfter the 1965 election of the Liberal Party, with Robert Askin becoming Premier of New South Wales, the relationship of client, architect, engineers and contractors became increasingly tense. Askin had been a \\"vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office.\\"[45] His new Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, was even less sympathetic. Elizabeth Farrelly, an Australian architecture critic, wrote that:\\r\\nat an election night dinner party in Mosman, Hughes' daughter Sue Burgoyne boasted that her father would soon sack Utzon. Hughes had no interest in art, architecture or aesthetics. A fraud, as well as a philistine, he had been exposed before Parliament and dumped as Country Party leader for 19 years of falsely claiming a university degree. The Opera House gave Hughes a second chance. For him, as for Utzon, it was all about control; about the triumph of homegrown mediocrity over foreign genius.[45]\\r\\nDifferences ensued. One of the first was that Utzon believed the clients should receive information on all aspects of the design and construction through his practice, while the clients wanted a system (notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes) where architect, contractors, and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately. This had great implications for procurement methods and cost control, with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers (such as Ralph Symonds for the plywood interiors) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be put out to tender.[28]\\r\\nUtzon was highly reluctant to respond to questions or criticism from the client's Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC).[46] However, he was greatly supported throughout by a member of the committee and one of the original competition judges, Harry Ingham Ashworth. Utzon was unwilling to compromise on some aspects of his designs that the clients wanted to change.\\r\\nUtzon's ability was never in doubt, despite questions raised by Davis Hughes, who attempted to portray Utzon as an impractical dreamer. Ove Arup actually stated that Utzon was \\"probably the best of any I have come across in my long experience of working with architects\\"[47] and: \\"The Opera House could become the world's foremost contemporary masterpiece if Utzon is given his head.\\"\\r\\nIn October 1965, Utzon gave Hughes a schedule setting out the completion dates of parts of his work for stage III.[citation needed] Utzon was at this time working closely with Ralph Symonds, a manufacturer of plywood based in Sydney and highly regarded by many, despite an Arup engineer warning that Ralph Symonds's \\"knowledge of the design stresses of plywood, was extremely sketchy\\" and that the technical advice was \\"elementary to say the least and completely useless for our purposes.\\" Australian architecture critic Elizabeth Farrelly has referred to Ove Arup's project engineer Michael Lewis as having \\"other agendas\\".[45] In any case, Hughes shortly after withheld permission for the construction of plywood prototypes for the interiors,[citation needed] and the relationship between Utzon and the client never recovered. By February 1966, Utzon was owed more than $100,000 in fees.[48] Hughes then withheld funding so that Utzon could not even pay his own staff. The government minutes record that following several threats of resignation, Utzon finally stated to Davis Hughes: \\"If you don't do it, I resign.\\" Hughes replied: \\"I accept your resignation. Thank you very much. Goodbye.\\"[49]\\r\\nUtzon left the project on 28 February 1966. He said that Hughes's refusal to pay him any fees and the lack of collaboration caused his resignation and later famously described the situation as \\"Malice in Blunderland\\". In March 1966, Hughes offered him a subordinate role as \\"design architect\\" under a panel of executive architects, without any supervisory powers over the House's construction, but Utzon rejected this. Utzon left the country never to return.\\r\\nFollowing the resignation, there was great controversy about who was in the right and who was in the wrong. The Sydney Morning Herald initially opined: \\"No architect in the world has enjoyed greater freedom than Mr Utzon. Few clients have been more patient or more generous than the people and the Government of NSW. One would not like history to record that this partnership was brought to an end by a fit of temper on the one side or by a fit of meanness on the other.\\" On 17 March 1966, the Herald offered the view that:[50] \\"It was not his [Utzon's] fault that a succession of Governments and the Opera House Trust should so signally have failed to impose any control or order on the project .... his concept was so daring that he himself could solve its problems only step by step .... his insistence on perfection led him to alter his design as he went along.\\"\\r\\nThe Sydney Opera House opened the way for the immensely complex geometries of some modern architecture. The design was one of the first examples of the use of computer-aided design to design complex shapes. The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture, such as works of Gehry and blobitecture, as well as most reinforced concrete structures. The design is also one of the first in the world to use araldite to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use.\\r\\nIt was also a first in mechanical engineering. Another Danish firm, Steensen Varming, was responsible for designing the new air-conditioning plant, the largest in Australia at the time, supplying over 600,000 cubic feet (17,000?m3) of air per minute,[51] using the innovative idea of harnessing the harbour water to create a water-cooled heat pump system that is still in operation today.[52]\\r\\nAfter the resignation of Utzon, the Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, and the Government Architect, Ted Farmer, organised a team to bring the Sydney Opera House to completion. The architectural work was divided between three appointees who became the Hall, Todd, Littlemore partnership. David Littlemore would manage construction supervision, Lionel Todd contract documentation, while the crucial role of design became the responsibility of Peter Hall.[53]:45\\r\\nPeter Hall (1931ÿ1995) completed a combined arts and architecture degree at Sydney University. Upon graduation a travel scholarship enabled him to spend twelve months in Europe during which time he visited Utzon in Helleb?k.[54] Returning to Sydney, Hall worked for the Government Architect, a branch of the NSW Public Works Department. While there he established himself as a talented design architect with a number of court and university buildings, including the Goldstein Hall at the University of New South Wales, which won the Sir John Sulman Medal in 1964.\\r\\nHall resigned from the Government Architects office in early 1966 to pursue his own practice. When approached to take on the design role, (after at least two prominent Sydney architects had declined), Hall spoke with Utzon by phone before accepting the position. Utzon reportedly told Hall: he (Hall) would not be able to finish the job and the Government would have to invite him back.[53](p46) Hall also sought the advice of others, including architect Don Gazzard who warned him acceptance would be a bad career move as the project would \\"never be his own\\".[53]:47\\r\\nHall agreed to accept the role on the condition there was no possibility of Utzon returning. Even so, his appointment did not go down well with many of his fellow architects who considered that no one but Utzon should complete the Sydney Opera House.[54] Upon Utzon's dismissal, a rally of protest had marched to Bennelong Point. A petition was also circulated, including in the Government Architects office. Peter Hall was one of the many who had signed the petition that called for Utzon's reinstatement.[54]\\r\\nWhen Hall agreed to the design role and was appointed in April 1966, he imagined he would find the design and documentation for the Stage III well advanced. What he found was an enormous amount of work ahead of him with many aspects completely unresolved by Utzon in relation to seating capacity, acoustics and structure.[53]:42 In addition Hall found the project had proceeded for nine years without the development of a concise client brief. To bring himself up to speed, Hall investigated concert and opera venues overseas and engaged stage consultant Ben Schlange and acoustic consultant Wilhelm Jordan, while establishing his team. In consultation with all the potential building users the first Review of Program was completed in January 1967. The most significant conclusion reached by Hall was that concert and opera were incompatible in the same hall.[53]:53 Although Utzon had sketched ideas using plywood for the great enclosing glass walls their structural viability was unresolved when Hall took on the design role.[53]:49 With the ability to delegate tasks and effectively coordinate the work of consultants, Hall guided the project for over five years until the opening day in 1973.\\r\\nA former Government Architect, Peter Webber, in his book Peter Hall: the Phantom of the Opera House, concludes: when Utzon resigned no one was better qualified (than Hall) to rise to the challenge of completing the design of the Opera House.[53]:126\\r\\nThe Sydney Opera House was formally opened by Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, on 20 October 1973. A large crowd attended. Utzon was not invited to the ceremony, nor was his name mentioned. The opening was televised and included fireworks and a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9.[55]\\r\\nDuring the construction phase, lunchtime performances were often arranged for the workers, with American vocalist Paul Robeson the first artist to perform, in 1960.\\r\\nVarious performances were presented prior to the official opening:\\r\\nAfter the opening:\\r\\nIn the late 1990s, the Sydney Opera House Trust resumed communication with Utzon in an attempt to effect a reconciliation and to secure his involvement in future changes to the building. In 1999, he was appointed by the Trust as a design consultant for future work.[60]\\r\\nIn 2004, the first interior space rebuilt to an Utzon design was opened, and renamed \\"The Utzon Room\\" in his honour. It contains an original Utzon tapestry (14.00 x 3.70 metres) called Homage to Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach.[61] In April 2007, he proposed a major reconstruction of the Opera Theatre, as it was then known.[62] Utzon died on 29 November 2008.[63]\\r\\nA state memorial service, attended by Utzon's son Jan and daughter Lin, celebrating his creative genius, was held in the Concert Hall on 25 March 2009 featuring performances, readings and recollections from prominent figures in the Australian performing arts scene.\\r\\nRefurbished Western Foyer and Accessibility improvements were commissioned on 17 November 2009, the largest building project completed since Utzon was re-engaged in 1999. Designed by Utzon and his son Jan, the project provided improved ticketing, toilet and cloaking facilities. New escalators and a public lift enabled enhanced access for the disabled and families with prams. The prominent paralympian athlete Louise Sauvage was announced as the building's \\"accessibility ambassador\\" to advise on further improvements to aid people with disabilities.[64]\\r\\nOn 29 March 2016, an original 1959 tapestry by Le Corbusier (2.18 x 3.55 metres), commissioned by Utzon to be hung in the Sydney Opera House and called Les Ds Sont Jets (The Dice Are Cast), was finally unveiled in situ after being owned by the Utzon family and held at their home in Denmark for over 50 years. The tapestry was bought at auction by the Sydney Opera House in June 2015. It now hangs in the building's Western Foyer and is accessible to the public.\\r\\nIn the second half of 2017, the Joan Sutherland Theatre was closed to replace the stage machinery and for other works. The Concert Hall is scheduled for work in 2020-2021.\\r\\nIn 1993, Constantine Koukias was commissioned by the Sydney Opera House Trust in association with REM Theatre to compose Icon, a large-scale music theatre piece for the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Opera House [65]\\r\\nDuring the 2000 Summer Olympics, the venue served as the focal point for the triathlon events. The event had a 1.5?km (0.9?mi) swimming loop at Farm Cove, along with competitions in the neighbouring Royal Botanical Gardens for the cycling and running portions of the event.[66]\\r\\nSince 2013, a group of residents from the nearby Bennelong Apartments (better known as 'The Toaster'), calling themselves the Sydney Opera House Concerned Citizens Group, have been campaigning against Forecourt Concerts on the grounds that they exceed noise levels outlined in the development approval (DA). In February 2017 the NSW Department of Planning and the Environment handed down a $15,000 fine to the Sydney Opera House for breach of allowed noise levels at a concert held in November 2015. However the DA was amended in 2016 to allow an increase in noise levels in the forecourt by 5 decibels. The residents opposing the concerts contend that a new DA should have been filed rather than an amendment.[67][68]\\r\\nThe Sydney Opera House sails formed a graphic projection-screen in a lightshow mounted in connection with the International Fleet Review in Sydney Harbour on 5 October 2013.[69]\\r\\nOn 31 December 2013, the venue's 40th anniversary year, a New Year firework display was mounted for the first time in a decade.[70]\\r\\nThe Sydney Opera House hosted an event, 'the biggest blind date' on Friday 21 February 2014 that won an historic Guinness World Record.[71]\\r\\n This Wikipedia article was originally based on the Sydney Opera House, listed on the \\"New South Wales State Heritage Register\\" published by the Government of New South Wales under CC-BY 3.0 AU licence (accessed on 3 September 2017).","input":"When did they start building the sydney opera house?"},{"output":"mid-1922","context":"Radio broadcasting in the United States is a major mass medium. Unlike radio in most other countries, American radio has historically relied primarily on commercial advertising sponsorship on for-profit stations. The U.S. does not have a national broadcaster that aims its programs at the general public. Nonprofit broadcasting typically comes in three forms: radio evangelism, community radio, and government-subsidized public radio, all of which rely at least to some extent on listener donations. Shortwave broadcasting in the United States includes federal government programs, as well as a limited number of privately managed broadcasts, for overseas audiences. Radio broadcasting became popular in the 1920s, alongside the new film industry. The arrival of television in the 1950s forced radio into a niche role, as leading participants moved into the much larger field of television. In the 21st century, radio has been adjusting to the arrival of the Internet and Internet radio.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1912, most amateur-radio transmissions were restricted to wavelengths below 200 meters (i.e., frequencies above 1500?kHz) to prevent interference to future commercial broadcasters.[1] The beginning of regular, commercially licensed radio broadcasting in the United States in 1920, along with the concurrent development of sound and color film in that decade, ended the print monopoly of mass media and opened the doors to the immediate (and pervasive) electronic media. By 1928, the United States had three national radio networks: two owned by NBC (the National Broadcasting Company), and one by CBS (the Columbia Broadcasting System). Until 1943, there were four major national radio networks: two owned by NBC, one owned by CBS and one owned by Mutual Broadcasting System. Stations were connected by broadcast-quality, leased telephone lines. NBC's second network became ABC, the American Broadcasting Company.[2]\\r\\nBy 1919, after the war, radio pioneers across the country resumed transmissions. The early stations gained new call signs. Some early stations were started by newspapers: the first to do this was 8MK (today WWJ) in Detroit, which was owned by the Detroit News. [3] While many sources cite KDKA in Pittsburgh as the first station, and give its first broadcast as November 2, 1920, the question of who came first is still in dispute among historians. [4] For example, there is evidence 8MK was on the air with Michigan state election returns on August 31, 1920 [5] Many other early stations were owned by small companies, such as AMRAD (the American Radio and Research Company, Medford Hillside MA); by some accounts, it broadcast voice and music as early as March 1916 [6], and was on the air sporadically till it began a daily schedule in May 1921, using call letters 1XE and later, WGI. [7] Perhaps the best-known early station began as experimental station 8XK, which became KDKA in 1920. AM radio signals traveled long distances, and KDKA's signal covered much of the country. The existence of early experimental radio stations encouraged young men (and a small number of young women) to build crystal sets (with ear phones) to listen to the new technical marvel. Entrepreneurs set up stations primarily with the goal of selling expensive console radio sets that the whole family could listen to, or which restaurants and shops would buy to attract customers.[8][9]\\r\\nUntil early 1922, there were fewer than forty commercial stations broadcasting. [10] But in mid-1922, the so-called \\"radio craze\\" began, when several hundred new stations took to the airwaves, and thousands of people wanted to buy their own radio set. Even President Warren G. Harding had a radio installed in the White House. [11]\\r\\nWhile \\"direct advertising\\" was not allowed in radio's formative years, per the order of then-head of the Department of Commerce Herbert Hoover [12], station owners wanted this policy changed, since it was very expensive to operate a radio station. By 1926, when the National Broadcasting Company went on the air, advertising was gradually allowed. Madison Avenue recognized the importance of radio as a new advertising medium. Advertising provided the major funding for most stations. The United States never had a license fee for set users.[13]\\r\\nThe National Broadcasting Company began regular broadcasting in 1926, with telephone links between New York and other Eastern cities. NBC became the dominant radio network, splitting into Red and Blue Networks. The Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) began in 1927 owned and directed by William S. Paley.[14]\\r\\nPrior to 1927, U.S. radio was supervised by the Department of Commerce. Then, the Radio Act of 1927 created the Federal Radio Commission (FRC). One of the FRC's early major moves was the implementation of General Order 40, designating AM radio stations as Clear Channel, Regional, and Local. Most stations' frequencies were changed to implement General Order 40 at 3:00 am EST on November 11, 1928.\\r\\nIn the early 1930s, a furious battle broke out as the newspaper industry tried to block the transmission of news by radio. Advertising revenues were plunging during the Great Depression, and newspapers were desperate to protect their main flow of income from the upstart's threat to the status quo. In one particular incident, the newspapers attempted to claim that a broadcast of the H. G. Wells story The War of the Worlds caused a mass hysteria among listeners who thought the broadcast was real news, a myth that continues to the present day. Hollywood briefly became involved, by preventing its stars from appearing on the radio; it soon realized, however, that radio was not a direct competition and the greater visibility for their stars met even larger audiences. The newspaper attack failed, and the networks set up their own newsgathering and reporting system, which played a major role during World War II.[15]\\r\\nIn 1934, the FRC was renamed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and remains in operation under this name.[16]\\r\\nAn FCC decision in 1939 required NBC to divest itself of its Blue Network. That decision was sustained by the Supreme Court in a 1943 decision, National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, which established the framework that the \\"scarcity\\" of radio-frequency meant that broadcasting was subject to greater regulation than other media. This Blue Network network became the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). Around 1946, ABC, NBC, and CBS began regular television broadcasts. The small DuMont Television Network, was founded earlier; it disbanded in 1956. In 1934, several independent stations formed the Mutual Broadcasting System to exchange syndicated programming, including The Lone Ranger and Amos 'n' Andy.\\r\\nPaley at CBS was the first to fully realize that profitability depended primarily on maximizing the sales of commercials, which in turn meant reaching as large an upscale audience as possible. Surveys and polls could be used to determine not only the size of the audience, but their affluence. Frank Stanton, the president of CBS, worked with Columbia University sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld to develop techniques for measuring audiences.[17]\\r\\nBefore Paley, owners typically viewed their stations as stand-alone outlets or as the broadcast equivalent of local newspapers. It was their job to sell ads to local business. Individual stations bought programming from the network and, thus, were considered the network's clients. Paley changed the business model by looking at national advertisers as the critical element. CBS therefore provided network programming to affiliate stations at a nominal cost, thereby ensuring the widest possible distribution for both the programming and the advertising. The advertisers then became the network's primary clients and, because of the wider distribution brought by the growing network, Paley was able to charge more for the ad time. Affiliates were required to carry programming offered by the network for part of the broadcast day, receiving a portion of the network's fees from advertising revenue. At other times in the broadcast day, affiliates were free to offer local programming and sell advertising time locally.[18]\\r\\nBy 1940, the greatest audience attention was on the networks' evening programs of variety shows, music, and comedy and drama. In the morning and afternoon, smaller audiences (chiefly housewives) listened to 61 soap operas. Phone-in talk shows were rare, but disk jockeys attracted a following through their chatter between records. The most popular radio shows during the Golden Age of Radio. The Jack Benny Program, Fibber McGee and Molly, The Goldbergs and other top-rated American radio shows were heard by 30ÿ35 percent of the radio audience.[19][20]\\r\\nIn a major technical move, the FCC mandated that 795 of the 883 United States broadcasters on the AM band shift their broadcast frequencies on March 29, 1941, in what was called \\"Radio Movin' Day\\" in the press, and was the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement. The goal was to improve AM reception inside the United States, and reduce interference to and from stations outside the United States.[21]\\r\\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt's opponents had control of most newspapers in the 1930s; press reports were under their control and involved hostile editorial commentary. Roosevelt's solution was a series of 30 evening broadcasts in an informal, almost casual setting, dubbed \\"Fireside chats.\\" Historian Douglas B. Craig says that he, \\"offered voters a chance to receive information unadulterated by newspaper proprietors' bias\\" through the new medium of radio.\\"[22]\\r\\nRoosevelt's radio audiences averaged 18 percent during peacetime, and 58 percent during the war. His address of May 27, 1941, was heard by 70 percent of the radio audience.[23]\\r\\nRadio's instant, on-the-spot reports of dramatic events drew large audiences starting in 1938 in the run-up to World War II.[24][25]\\r\\nAll broadcast stations are licensed locally, in the past with mandated obligations to their \\"city of service,\\" fulfillment of which for license renewal is today largely pass. For many a \\"250-watt station in my hometown,\\" expensive facilities emulated the networks' in the form of multiple, acoustically fine studios in art deco style for local origination of music and variety programs, featuring local, mostly volunteer, talented teens and energetic young adults motivated by the possibility of being discovered. Local programs were \\"sustaining\\" (covered by general ad revenue), or the talent found their own sponsors and bought station time. Often paid just over minimum wage, \\"combo operator-announcers,\\" later called DJs, nevertheless came to consider themselves entertainers, often in fact becoming local celebrities, who cultivated \\"on-air personalities,\\" sometimes pairing one who was straight-laced with one playing the clown. Practical jokes by full-time staff were common, the unseeing audience none the wiser unless someone broke up laughing.\\r\\nContinuous station operations were manual (until automation debuted in the 1970s), and could originate programming only three ways: live; live via remote telephone line (including network feeds as well as store openings and church services around town); or played from \\"electrical transcription\\" (ET) phonograph discs. ETs up to 16in diameter played 15 minute syndicated programs, mailed to stations by the thousands, many for government sales of savings bonds and military recruiting. Magnetic tape arrived after 1947 and the Bing Crosby/Ampex alliance. All sound was monophonic until introduction of the stereo LP in 1958, when sister stations \\"simulcast\\" the left signal on AM, the right on FM, requiring audiofans to set up two receivers. For both practitioners and attentive listeners, local radio during the Golden Age was fun.[26]\\r\\nRadio in education began as early as April 1922, when Medford Hillside's WGI Radio broadcast the first of an ongoing series of educational lectures from Tufts College professors. These lectures were described by the press as a sort of \\"wireless college.\\"[27] Soon, other colleges across the U.S. began adding radio broadcasting courses to their curricula; some, like the University of Iowa, even provided what today would be known as distance-learning credits.[28] Curry College in Massachusetts introduced one of the nation's first broadcasting majors in 1932 when the college teamed up with WLOE in Boston to have students broadcast programs. In the 1950s, television courses became popular.[29] After 2000, Internet-based transmission of college courses came on line. 2012 was the \\"year of the MOOC\\" (massive open online course).[30]\\r\\nAfter 1955 television's visual images replaced the audio-only limitation of radio as the predominant entertainment and news vehicle. Radio adapted by replacing entertainment programs with schedules of music interspersed with news and features, a free-form format adopted by NBC when it launched its popular weekend-long Monitor in 1955. During the 1950s automobile manufacturers began offering car radios as standard accessories, and radio received a boost as Americans listened to their car radios as they drove to and from work. Although this period saw the overall decline of the AM radio, some new stations, like the WGIV station in Charlotte dedicated to African American Music, were still coming up.\\r\\nIn the 1950s, as a result of television's increased popularity coupled with dramatically loosened restrictions on playing recorded music on air, the network model of radio dramatically declined. In its place was the first music radio format: top 40, the forerunner to modern contemporary hit radio. Top 40 stations could be operated locally and gave rise to the disc jockeys, who became prominent local celebrities in their own right. Top 40 became the outlet for the relatively new style of music known as rock and roll.\\r\\nFM radio, which was the successor to the failed Apex band (also known as ultra-shortwave) experiments of the 1930s, arrived in the United States in 1941, but it was not until the 1960s that it saw broad adoption. This was due in large part to a 1945 Federal Communication Commission decision which shifted FM's allocation of frequencies from 42-50 MHZ to 88-108 MHz. This allowed FM much more room for growth when listeners arrived after 1960, but rendered hundreds of thousands of already-existing Armstrong-FM sets useless overnight, and set adoption of FM in the United States back years. The FCC later decided to reduce program duplication on AM and FM sister stations, giving the younger medium space to grow. The better sound fidelity of FM, the less static, dated a natural for musical programming. The first FM stations were primarily instrumental, featuring formats that would come to be known as easy listening and beautiful music, and were targeted at shopping centers. Other, later FM sign-ons became known for experimentation; the early freeform stations eventually evolved into progressive rock, the first radio format designed specifically to showcase rock music. From progressive rock came album-oriented rock, which in turn spawned the modern formats of classic rock, active rock and adult album alternative.[31]\\r\\nTop 40 radio would begin arriving on the FM band in the 1970s as FM reached critical mass. As the amount of archival music from the rock and roll era began to expand, oldies radio stations began to appear, later evolving into the modern classic hits and later adult hits formats. FM radio made a major expansion in the late 1980s with the FCC's Docket 80-90, which expanded the number of available FM licenses in the suburban areas of the United States. Country music in particular, previously only heard on rural AM stations particularly in the Southern and Western United States, benefited from this docket, moving en masse to FM; the beautiful music and easy listening formats mostly died out, with adult contemporary music taking its place.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the AM band began declining. All-news radio became popular in the major cities in the late 1960s. As each successive radio format moved to FM, AM radio stations were left with fewer and fewer options. One of the last \\"AM only\\" formats was MOR, or \\"middle-of-the-road\\", the direct forerunner of adult contemporary music and adult standards. Talk radio, although it had a small following in the cities, did not achieve mainstream popularity until the 1980s, when a combination of factors led to the rise of conservative talk radio. The politically charged format swept the country, bringing stardom to one of its pioneers, Rush Limbaugh. Also rising to popularity in the late 1980s was sports radio, which was dedicated to talk about sports as well as the broadcasting of sports events.[32] What few country stations remained on AM typically shifted to classic country and focused primarily on older music.\\r\\nWhile shock jocks had been in existence since at least the 1970s (see, for example, Don Imus) and the morning zoo radio format was popular among local stations beginning in the 1980s, the first shock jock to make a major national impact was Howard Stern, whose New York-based show was syndicated nationwide beginning in the early 1990s. Stern built a multimedia empire that incorporated television, books and feature films, which led to him bestowing upon himself the title of \\"King of All Media.\\" Stern left terrestrial radio in 2005.\\r\\nSatellite networks began replacing landline-based models in the 1980s, making possible wider and quicker national distribution of both talk and music radio. At the same time, the traditional networks started collapsing: NBC Radio and Mutual both were acquired by syndication company Westwood One, while ABC (both radio and television) was acquired by Capital Cities Communications. CBS would later acquire Westwood One, only to spin it off in 2007; as of 2015, Westwood One is now in the hands of Cumulus Media. ABC would end up in the hands of The Walt Disney Company, who broke the radio network up in 2007; Disney owns portions of the old network, while the rest of it is in the hands of Cumulus. Mutual was dissolved in 1999, replaced by CNN Radio, which itself was dissolved in 2012. CBS still owns much of its original network, the last of the four major networks of the Golden Age to do so; its programming is mostly funneled through Cumulus.\\r\\nTwo other major commercial networks have appeared since the 1990s: Premiere Networks, the division of iHeartMedia, and the Salem Radio Network. Premiere owns the radio distribution rights to the current \\"fourth major network\\", Fox (which owns no radio stations), and distributes that company's news and sports radio broadcasts. iHeart's immediate predecessor, Clear Channel Communications, benefited from the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which allowed for greater media consolidation, and built a large empire of both large and small market radio stations; Clear Channel, having overextended itself, jettisoned most of its small-market stations (as well as its now-dissolved television division) in the late 2000s. The Salem Radio Network, a division of Salem Communications (which outside of radio also has a large Internet operation), primarily has a Christian/conservative focus and specializes in Christian music, preaching stations and conservative talk radio, both owning stations and producing original content. Oaktree Capital Management briefly attempted a foray into building a radio network when it purchased the assets of several struggling radio networks in the late 2000s; while it still owns stations through its Townsquare Media holding company, it has since spun off its network holdings (which operated under the Dial Global brand) to Cumulus.\\r\\nDirect-to-consumer subscription satellite radio began appearing in the United States in the early 2000s, but despite heavy investment in programming has continually lost money and has less than a tenth of the reach of terrestrial radio. The two competing satellite radio services, Sirius and XM, merged to form Sirius XM Radio in 2009 and now has a government-regulated monopoly on the format.\\r\\nWhile broadcast radio stations will often brand themselves with plain-text names, identities such as \\"cool FM\\", \\"rock 105\\" or \\"the ABC network\\" are not unique. Another station, in another city or country, may (and often will) have a similar brand; the name of a broadcast station for legal purposes is, therefore, normally its ITU call sign.\\r\\nBroadcast stations in North America generally use call letters in the international series, with common conventions followed in each country. In the United States, the first letter generally is K for stations west of the Mississippi River and W for those east of the Mississippi; all new call signs have had four characters since 1930,[33] although there are historical three-character calls still in use (such as WOR in New York City, WBZ in Boston, WOL in Washington DC, WSB in Atlanta, WMC in Memphis, WGN in Chicago, KOA in Denver, KSL in Salt Lake City, KEX in Portland, Oregon, KUT in Austin, and KFI in Los Angeles).[34]\\r\\nThe expansion and dominance of FM radio, which has better audio quality but a more-limited broadcast range than AM, represented the major technical change in radio during the 1970s and 1980s. FM radio (aided by the development of smaller portable radios and \\"Walkman\\" headsets) dominates music programming, while AM has largely shifted to talk and news formats. Talk radio became more popular during the 1980s as a result of improved satellite communications, the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine and (by the mid-1990s) extensive concentration of media ownership stemming from the Telecommunications Act of 1996. While before the 1980s talk radio was primarily a local phenomenon, the development of national spoken-word programming contributed to the renewed popularity of AM radio. However, this popularity is fading as previously AM-only stations begin moving their operations to FM simulcasts or translators, and as the audience of talk radio ages.\\r\\nBoth FM and AM radio have become increasingly specialized. Music formats (for instance) comprise a variety of specializations, the top five in 1991 being \\"country and western\\", \\"adult contemporary\\", \\"Top 40\\", \\"religion\\" and \\"oldies\\". Radio has been shaped by demographics, although to a lesser degree than television; modern radio formats target groups of people by age, gender, urban (or rural) setting and race. As such, freeform stations with broad-spanning playlists have become uncommon on commercial radio.\\r\\nIn an era in which TV is the predominant medium, the reach of radio is still extensive. Ninety-nine percent of American households in 1999 had at least one radio; the average is five per household. Every day, radio reaches 80 percent of the U.S. population. Revenue more than doubled in a decade, from $8.4 billion in 1990 to more than $17 billion in 2000.[citation needed] Radio continues to prevail in automobiles and offices, where attention can be kept on the road (or the task at hand) while radio is an audio background. The popularity of car radios has led to drive time being the most listened-to dayparts on most radio stations, followed by midday (or the \\"at work\\" shift). Transistor radios, a technology that has been available since the 1950s, were the method of choice for listening to music on the go for most of the late 20th century, before digital media players and later smartphones (many of which have FM radios as part of their hardware) took those roles in the 20th century.\\r\\nThe majority of programming in the United States is in English, with Spanish the second-most popular broadcast language; these are the only two languages with domestically produced, national radio networks. In the largest urban areas of the United States, \\"world ethnic\\" stations may be found with a wide variety of languages (including Russian, Chinese, Korean and the languages of India); relatively widespread languages French and German have comparatively few radio outlets (in the case of German, due to the fact that most of its speakers are Amish or from similar sects and thus shun radio technology). French speakers can generally receive programming direct from Canadian broadcasters, which are receivable across the CanadaÿUS border and a handful of local stations serving the Haitian diaspora and Creole populations also serve areas in the southeast.\\r\\nUntil the 1980s, most commercial radio stations were affiliated with large networks such as ABC, CBS, the Mutual Broadcasting System, NBC, and others (e.g., RKO in the 1980s). The traditional major networks that had dominated the history of American radio up to that point began to be dissolved in the 1980s; RKO was forced to break up in a billing scandal, while NBC Radio and Mutual sold their assets to up-and-coming syndicator Westwood One, which itself would be bought by rival CBS in the 1990s. ABC maintained most of its radio network until 2007, when it sold off most of its stations to Citadel Broadcasting and later Cumulus Media (it maintains two specialty networks, sports-oriented ESPN Radio and youth top 40 Radio Disney, the latter of which has largely shifted to Internet radio; ABC still produces radio programming in addition to its terrestrial networks). CBS sold off Westwood One to private equity interests in the late 2000s as well, but unlike its rivals maintained ownership of its flagship stations. As of 2012, most commercial radio stations are controlled by media conglomerates and private equity firms such as Bain Capital (Clear Channel Communications), Oaktree Capital Management (Townsquare Media) and Cumulus Media.\\r\\nUnlike most countries, the national and state governments in the U.S. do not operate any stations or networks directed at its own domestic citizens. It does operate networks overseas through the Broadcasting Board of Governors; the most widely known of these networks is Voice of America, which serves a general worldwide audience; other networks target specific geographic regions. Broadcasting Board of Governors networks were, until 2013, expressly forbidden from being marketed to American citizens; they still neither own nor affiliate with any AM or FM station. The U.S. also provides the American Forces Network, a service for American armed servicemen stationed overseas that mostly relays commercial programming; AFN broadcasts are restricted to listeners in Japan, Korea and parts of Europe. In lieu of a national broadcaster, the United States government instead subsidizes nonprofit radio programming through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.[35]\\r\\nIn 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by private foundations, universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by donations, foundations, subscriptions and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation. (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other.)[36]\\r\\nThe BBC World Service has been distributed in the United States since 1986; until July 2012 by PRI, and since then by APM.[37]\\r\\nA new form of radio which is gaining popularity is satellite radio. Sirius XM Radio has a monopoly on the technology after the merger of Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio. Unlike terrestrial-radio broadcasting, most channels feature few (or no) commercials. Satellite-radio content is not regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[38]\\r\\nCable radio, a slightly older technology, has also become widespread; Music Choice is the market leader in this field, with its primary competitors being Sirius XM, Muzak, DMX, Sonic Tap and Canada-based Galaxie. CRN Digital Talk Radio Networks specialize in talk radio. Cable radio has the disadvantage that it requires a cable TV hookup, limiting its use outside the home.[39]\\r\\nUnlike the mandated digital television transition, the U.S. government has not mandated a transition to digital radio, although it allows digital radio to be broadcast. The national standard is HD Radio, a proprietary in-band on-channel format that allows digital and analog signals to be broadcast simultaneously. Radio companies aggressively marketed HD Radio throughout the 2000s, touting its clearer signal and capacity for digital subchannels, but the technology never caught on with the general public. The negatives were cost, signal reception problems, a general lack of quality programming on the subchannels, and (especially on AM HD stations) adjacent-channel interference. HD Radio's primary use has been to exploit an FCC loophole to allow low-power broadcast translators to carry HD subchannels in analog, thus giving radio station groups the ability to program more program services in a market than the federally mandated maximum number of stations allowed. FMeXtra is another subchannel service authorized for use in the United States, although that service is generally limited to voice transmissions due to lower bandwidth.[40]\\r\\nInternet radio, digital music players and streaming-capable smartphones are a challenge to terrestrial radio. Unlike satellite radio, most Internet stations do not require a subscription; several of the more popular ones use algorithms which allow listeners to customize the music they want to hear and select new music which may interest them. The proliferation of internet-based stations (which are more numerous and easier to set up than their television counterparts) creates a threat of audience fracturing beyond that experienced by television due to cable and satellite providers.\\r\\nAlthough not nearly to the extent that AM radio has declined in neighboring Canada, AM radio has also begun to decline in the United States. To partially combat this, radio ownership groups have increasingly moved their signals to FM, either through low-power broadcast translators (primarily on small, independent and/or rural stations) or through simulcast on full-market FM stations. The AM-to-FM phenomenon began primarily in mid-sized markets, where there is more bandwidth and less competition, but has since progressed even to New York City, where as of 2012 sports-talk AM stations WEPN and WFAN have both acquired FM stations with the intent to either move or simulcast their AM programming. By 2013 most of the AM/FM simulcasts had been discontinued, in part due to redundancy and the fact that most listeners to AM stations stayed with AM while very few new listeners were picked up on the FM side.\\r\\nAbridged from U.S. State Department IIP publications and other U.S. government materials.\\r\\nAcademy of Radio Arts & Sciences of America","input":"When did the radio became a household item?"},{"output":"Category 4","context":"The list of North Carolina hurricanes includes 413?known tropical or subtropical cyclones that have affected the U.S. state of North Carolina. Due to its location, many hurricanes have hit the state directly, and numerous hurricanes have passed near or through North Carolina in its history; the state is ranked fourth, after Florida, Texas, and Louisiana, in the number of cyclones that produced hurricane-force winds in a U.S. state.[2][3] Hurricanes in North Carolina history are responsible for over $11?billion in damage (2008?USD) and almost 1,000?total fatalities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to statistical hurricane research between 1883 and 1996 by the North Carolina State Climatology Office, a tropical cyclone makes landfall along the coastline about once every four years. An estimated 17.5?percent of all North Atlantic tropical cyclones have affected the state.[4] Additionally, the remnants of a few Pacific tropical cyclones struck the state.[5] Cape Hatteras is most affected by storms within the state, though Cape Lookout and Cape Fear are also regularly affected; the increased activity in three areas is because it protrudes from elsewhere along the Atlantic coastline.[4] After Southern Florida, Cape Hatteras has the lowest return period, or the frequency at which a certain intensity or category of hurricane can be expected within 86?mi (139?km) of a given location, in the country.[6] As the Outer Banks are a narrow strip of low-lying land, hurricanes occasionally leave portions of the land partially or fully submerged.[7] Additionally, the remnants of inland tropical cyclones have produced flooding and landslides in the state's western region.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nTropical cyclones have affected North Carolina in every month between May and December; about 35?percent of the storms struck the state in September, and 80?percent affected the state between August and October, which coincides with the peak of the hurricane season. The earliest storm to affect the state was Subtropical Storm Andrea on May 7, 2007, and the latest was a tropical storm that moved across the Outer Banks on December 2, 1925. The strongest storm to strike the state was Hurricane Hazel on October 15, 1954, which made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane on the SaffirÿSimpson Hurricane Scale.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe list of North Carolina hurricanes before 1900 encompasses 139?tropical cyclones that affected the U.S. state of North Carolina. Collectively, cyclones in North Carolina during the time period resulted in over 775?direct fatalities during the period.

From the beginning of the official Atlantic hurricane record in 1851 to 1899, there were 12?years without a known tropical cyclone affecting the state.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorical data prior to 1700 is sparse due to lack of significant European settlements along the coastline; the few storms listed are largely records from Roanoke Colony and later the Province of Carolina. Modern meteorologists believe early storms were tropical cyclones, though due to the time period confirmation is impossible.[10] One theory explaining the disappearance of Roanoke Colony suggests a hurricane destroyed the village, though there is no evidence to prove the theory. It is considered unlikely due to lack of damage to a fence around the village, on which the villagers left an inscription.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1900 and 1949, 75?tropical cyclones or their remnants affected the state. Collectively, cyclones in North Carolina during that time period resulted in 53?total fatalities during the period, as well as about $328?million in damage (2008?USD). Tropical cyclone affected the state in all but nine seasons. In the 1916 season, five storms affected the state, which was the season with the most storms devastating the state. The strongest hurricanes to affect the state during the time period were the 1933 Outer Banks hurricane and the 1944 Great Atlantic Hurricane, which produced winds of Category?3 status on the SaffirÿSimpson Hurricane Scale within the state.[2] The 1933 Outer Banks hurricane was the deadliest hurricane in the state during the time period, which killed 21?people.[12] The remnants of a hurricane in 1940 dropped heavy rainfall in the state, which caused over $150?million in damage (2008?USD) from flooding and landslides.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of 79?tropical or subtropical cyclones affected North Carolina between 1950 and 1979.

A cyclone affected the state in every year during the time period, and in three seasons a total of five cyclones assailed the state. The strongest hurricane to hit the state during the time period was Hurricane Hazel, which struck the state as a Category?4 hurricane on the SaffirÿSimpson Hurricane Scale. Hazel was both the costliest and deadliest cyclone during the period, causing over $1?billion in damage (2008?USD) and 19?deaths.[14] Most storms affected the state in September, though cyclones lashed the state between May and October.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period from 1980 to the present encompasses 120?tropical or subtropical cyclones that affected the state. Collectively, cyclones in North Carolina during the time period resulted in over $10?billion in damage (2010?USD), primarily from hurricanes Fran and Floyd. Additionally, tropical cyclones in North Carolina were responsible for 77?direct fatalities and at least 44?indirect casualties during the period. Eight cyclones affected the state in the 1985 season, which was the year with the most tropical cyclones striking the state. Every year included at least one tropical cyclone affecting the state.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strongest hurricane to hit the state during the time period was Hurricane Fran in 1996, which struck near Wilmington as a Category?3 hurricane on the SaffirÿSimpson Hurricane Scale; Hurricane Emily in 1993 brushed the Outer Banks also as a Category?3 hurricane.[2] The deadliest hurricane during the period was Hurricane Floyd in 1999, which caused 35?fatalities and recordÿbreaking flooding in the eastern portion of the state.[15][16] Hurricane Irene hit the Outer Banks on August 27th 2011 as a Category 1, making it the first of its kind to make landfall since Hurricane Ike in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following major hurricanes either made landfall on the state or brought winds of Category 3 status to the state.

Tricon selected Louisville as its headquarters, moving near the KFC Restaurant Support Center from the Pepsi HQ in Purchase, New York, by early 1998.[5]\\r\\nIn 2000, Tricon Global agreed to test multi-branded locations with Yorkshire Global Restaurants. By March 2002, the Tricon-Yorkshire multibranding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver's and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver's and was considered successful by the companies.[6]\\r\\nIn 2001, KFC started test restaurants in Austin, Texas, called \\"Wing Works\\", which is a chicken wing line sold with one of a few flavored sauces. Also, KFC hired a consultant to develop a breakfast menu.[7]\\r\\nIn March 2002, Tricon announced the acquisition of Lexington, Kentucky-based Yorkshire Global Restaurants, owner of the Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants[8] chains and its intention to change the company's name to Yum!

The name change became effective after a vote during the company's annual shareholders meeting by May 22, 2002[9] while the acquisition was finalized on May 8th. On June 6, 2002, Yum! executed a two-for-one stock split.[10] Shortly afterwards, due to Yum!'s lifetime contract with Pepsi, Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants (both of which previously served Coca-Cola products) began switching to Pepsi products, with A&W Restaurants retaining A&W Root Beer from a separate deal with Dr Pepper/Seven Up (now Dr Pepper Snapple Group).\\r\\nIn 2002, Yum! began testing co-branding locations pairing Pizza Hut with Pasta Bravo, Back Yard Burgers and A&W.[11] The Pasta Bravo concept was acquired in 2003 from Pasta Bravo, Inc. of Aliso Viejo, California for $5 million to pair with Pizza Hut.[12]\\r\\nIn 2003, Yum! launched WingStreet as a hybrid combo unit with an existing Pizza Hut franchise.[13] In 2007 and 2008, a thousand WingStreet stores a year were opened.

For the decade leading up to the company's announcement, major growth had relied on international expansion. With little presence outside North America, the two chains no longer fit in the company's long-term growth plans.[16] The foreign expansionparticularly that of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hutwas cited in the firm's January 18, 2011, announcement of its intention to sell the A&W and Long John Silver's chains. Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio.

Their activity today centers on collective bargaining over wages, benefits, and working conditions for their membership, and on representing their members in disputes with management over violations of contract provisions. Larger unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and electioneering at the state and federal level.\\r\\nMost unions in the United States are aligned with one of two larger umbrella organizations: the AFL-CIO created in 1955, and the Change to Win Federation which split from the AFL-CIO in 2005. Both advocate policies and legislation on behalf of workers in the United States and Canada, and take an active role in politics. The AFL-CIO is especially concerned with global trade issues.\\r\\nIn 2016, there were 14.6 million members in the U.S., down from 17.7 million in 1983. The percentage of workers belonging to a union in the United States (or total labor union \\"density\\") was 10.7%, compared to 20.1% in 1983.[1][2] Union membership in the private sector has fallen under 7%[3]  levels not seen since 1932. From a global perspective, the density in 2013 was 7.7% in France, 18.1% in Germany, 27.1% in Canada, and 85.5% in Iceland, which is currently highest in the world.[2]\\r\\nIn the 21st century the most prominent unions are among public sector employees such as city employees, government workers, teachers and police. Members of unions are disproportionately older, male, and residents of the Northeast, the Midwest, and California.[4] Union workers average 10-30% higher pay than non-union in the United States after controlling for individual, job, and labor market characteristics.[5]\\r\\nAlthough much smaller compared to their peak membership in the 1950s, American unions remain a political factor, both through mobilization of their own memberships and through coalitions with like-minded activist organizations around issues such as immigrant rights, trade policy, health care, and living wage campaigns. Of special concern are efforts by cities and states to reduce the pension obligations owed to unionized workers who retire in the future.[6] Republicans elected with Tea Party support in 2010, most notably Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin, have launched major efforts against public sector unions due in part to state government pension obligations along with the allegation that the unions are too powerful.[7][8] States with higher levels of union membership tend to have higher median incomes[9] and standards of living.[10] It has been asserted by scholars and the International Monetary Fund that rising income inequality in the United States is directly attributable to the decline of the labor movement and union membership.[11][12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnions began forming in the mid-19th century in response to the social and economic impact of the industrial revolution. National labor unions began to form in the post-Civil War Era. The Knights of Labor emerged as a major force in the late 1880s, but it collapsed because of poor organization, lack of effective leadership, disagreement over goals, and strong opposition from employers and government forces.\\r\\nThe American Federation of Labor, founded in 1886 and led by Samuel Gompers until his death in 1924, proved much more durable. It arose as a loose coalition of various local unions. It helped coordinate and support strikes and eventually became a major player in national politics, usually on the side of the Democrats.\\r\\nAmerican labor unions benefited greatly from the New Deal policies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1930s. The Wagner Act, in particular, legally protected the right of unions to organize. Unions from this point developed increasingly closer ties to the Democratic Party, and are considered a backbone element of the New Deal Coalition.\\r\\nPro-business conservatives gained control of Congress in 1946, and in 1947 passed the Taft-Hartley Act, drafted by Senator Robert A. Taft. President Truman vetoed it but the Conservative coalition overrode the veto. The veto override had considerable Democratic support, including 106 out of 177 Democrats in the House, and 20 out of 42 Democrats in the Senate.[14] The law, which is still in effect, banned union contributions to political candidates, restricted the power of unions to call strikes that \\"threatened national security,\\" and forced the expulsion of Communist union leaders (the Supreme Court found the anticommunist provision to be unconstitutional, and it is no longer in force). The unions campaigned vigorously for years to repeal the law but failed. During the late 1950s, the Landrum Griffin Act of 1959 passed in the wake of Congressional investigations of corruption and undemocratic internal politics in the Teamsters and other unions.[15][16]\\r\\nThe percentage of workers belonging to a union (or \\"density\\") in the United States peaked in 1954 at almost 35% and the total number of union members peaked in 1979 at an estimated 21.0 million. Membership has declined since, with private sector union membership beginning a steady decline that continues into the 2010s, but the membership of public sector unions grew steadily.\\r\\nAfter 1960 public sector unions grew rapidly and secured good wages and high pensions for their members. While manufacturing and farming steadily declined, state- and local-government employment quadrupled from 4 million workers in 1950 to 12 million in 1976 and 16.6 million in 2009.[17] Adding in the 3.7 million federal civilian employees, in 2010 8.4 million government workers were represented by unions,[18] including 31% of federal workers, 35% of state workers and 46% of local workers.[19] As Daniel Disalvo notes, \\"In today's public sector, good pay, generous benefits, and job security make possible a stable middle-class existence for nearly everyone from janitors to jailors.\\"[20]\\r\\nBy the 1970s, a rapidly increasing flow of imports (such as automobiles, steel and electronics from Germany and Japan, and clothing and shoes from Asia) undercut American producers.[21] By the 1980s there was a large-scale shift in employment with fewer workers in high-wage sectors and more in the low-wage sectors.[22] Many companies closed or moved factories to Southern states (where unions were weak),[23] countered the threat of a strike by threatening to close or move a plant,[24] or moved their factories offshore to low-wage countries.[25] The number of major strikes and lockouts fell by 97% from 381 in 1970 to 187 in 1980 to only 11 in 2010.[24][26] On the political front, the shrinking unions lost influence in the Democratic Party, and pro-Union liberal Republicans faded away.[27] Union membership among workers in private industry shrank dramatically, though after 1970 there was growth in employees unions of federal, state and local governments.[28][29] The intellectual mood in the 1970s and 1980s favored deregulation and free competition.[30] Numerous industries were deregulated, including airlines, trucking, railroads and telephones, over the objections of the unions involved.[31] The climax came when President Ronald Reagana former union presidentbroke the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) strike in 1981, dealing a major blow to unions.[26][32]\\r\\nRepublicans, using conservative think tanks as idea farms, began to push through legislative blueprints to curb the power of public employee unions as well as eliminate business regulations.[25][33][34]\\r\\n???

Both organizations advocate policies and legislation favorable to workers in the United States and Canada, and take an active role in politics favoring the Democratic party but not exclusively so. The AFL-CIO is especially concerned with global trade and economic issues.\\r\\nPrivate sector unions are regulated by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), passed in 1935 and amended since then. The law is overseen by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), an independent federal agency. Public sector unions are regulated partly by federal and partly by state laws. In general they have shown robust growth rates, because wages and working conditions are set through negotiations with elected local and state officials. The unions' political power thus comes into play, and of course the local government cannot threaten to move elsewhere, nor is there any threat from foreign competition.\\r\\nTo join a traditional labor union, workers must either be given voluntary recognition from their employer or have a majority of workers in a bargaining unit vote for union representation.[citation needed] In either case, the government must then certify the newly formed union.[citation needed] Other forms of unionism include minority unionism, solidarity unionism, and the practices of organizations such as the Industrial Workers of the World, which do not always follow traditional organizational models.\\r\\nPublic sector worker unions are governed by labor laws and labor boards in each of the 50 states. Northern states typically model their laws and boards after the NLRA and the NLRB. In other states, public workers have no right to establish a union as a legal entity. (About 40% of public employees in the USA do not have the right to organize a legally established union.)[36][37]\\r\\nA review conducted by the federal government on pay scale shows that employees in a labor union earn up to 33% more income than their nonunion counterparts, as well as having more job security, and safer and higher-quality work conditions.[38] The median weekly income for union workers was $973 in 2014, compared with $763 for nonunion workers.[35]\\r\\nOnce the union has won the support of a majority of the bargaining unit and is certified in a workplace, it has the sole authority to negotiate the conditions of employment. However, under the NLRA, if a minority of employees voted for a union, those employees can then form a union which represents the rights of only those members who voted for the union.[citation needed] This minority model was once widely used, but was discarded when unions began to consistently win majority support. Unions are beginning to revisit the \\"members only\\" model of unionism because of new changes to labor law which unions view as curbing workers' ability to organize.\\r\\nThe employer and the union write the terms and conditions of employment in a legally binding contract. When disputes arise over the contract, most contracts call for the parties to resolve their differences through a grievance process to see if the dispute can be mutually resolved. If the union and the employer still cannot settle the matter, either party can choose to send the dispute to arbitration, where the case is argued before a neutral third party.\\r\\nRight-to-work statutes forbid unions from negotiating union shops and agency shops. Thus, while unions do exist in \\"right-to-work\\" states, they are typically weaker.\\r\\nMembers of labor unions enjoy \\"Weingarten Rights.\\" If management questions the union member on a matter that may lead to discipline or other changes in working conditions, union members can request representation by a union representative. Weingarten Rights are named for the first Supreme Court decision to recognize those rights.[39]\\r\\nThe NLRA goes farther in protecting the right of workers to organize unions. It protects the right of workers to engage in any \\"concerted activity\\" for mutual aid or protection. Thus, no union connection is needed. Concerted activity \\"in its inception involves only a speaker and a listener, for such activity is an indispensable preliminary step to employee self-organization.\\"[40]\\r\\nUnions are currently advocating new federal legislation, the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA), that would allow workers to elect union representation by simply signing a support card (card check). The current process established by federal law requires at least 30% of employees to sign cards for the union, then wait 45 to 90 days for a federal official to conduct a secret ballot election in which a simple majority of the employees must vote for the union in order to obligate the employer to bargain.\\r\\nUnions report that, under the present system, many employers use the 45- to 90-day period to conduct anti-union campaigns. Some opponents of this legislation fear that removing secret balloting from the process will lead to the intimidation and coercion of workers on behalf of the unions. During the 2008 elections, the Employee Free Choice Act had widespread support of many legislators in the House and Senate, and of the President. Since then, support for the \\"card check\\" provisions of the EFCA subsided substantially.\\r\\nUnion membership had been declining in the US since 1954, and since 1967, as union membership rates decreased, middle class incomes shrank correspondingly.[41] In 2007, the labor department reported the first increase in union memberships in 25 years and the largest increase since 1979. Most of the recent gains in union membership have been in the service sector while the number of unionized employees in the manufacturing sector has declined. Most of the gains in the service sector have come in West Coast states like California where union membership is now at 16.7% compared with a national average of about 12.1%.[42] Historically, the rapid growth of public employee unions since the 1960s has served to mask an even more dramatic decline in private-sector union membership.\\r\\nAt the apex of union density in the 1940s, only about 9.8% of public employees were represented by unions, while 33.9% of private, non-agricultural workers had such representation. In this decade, those proportions have essentially reversed, with 36% of public workers being represented by unions while private sector union density had plummeted to around 7%. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics most recent survey indicates that union membership in the US has risen to 12.4% of all workers, from 12.1% in 2007. For a short period, private sector union membership rebounded, increasing from 7.5% in 2007 to 7.6% in 2008.[35] However, that trend has since reversed. In 2013 there were 14.5 million members in the U.S., compared with 17.7 million in 1983. In 2013, the percentage of workers belonging to a union was 11.3%, compared to 20.1% in 1983. The rate for the private sector was 6.7%, and for the public sector 35.3%.[1]\\r\\nIn the ten years 2005 through 2014, the National Labor Relations Board recorded 18,577 labor union representation elections; in 11,086 of these elections (60 percent), the majority of workers voted for union representation. Most of the elections (15,517) were triggered by employee petitions for representation, of which unions won 9,933. Less common were elections caused by employee petitions for decertification (2792, of which unions won 1070), and employer-filed petitions for either representation or decertification (268, of which unions won 85).[43][44]\\r\\nIn the US, labor education programs such as the Harvard Trade Union Program [45] created in 1942 by Harvard University professor John Thomas Dunlop sought to educate union members to deal with important contemporary workplace and labor law issues of the day. The Harvard Trade Union Program is currently part of a broader initiative at Harvard Law School called the Labor and Worklife Program[46] that deals with a wide variety of labor and employment issues from union pension investment funds to the effects of nanotechnology on labor markets and the workplace.\\r\\nCornell University is known to be one of the leading centers for labor education in the world, establishing the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations in 1945. The school's mission is to prepare leaders, inform national and international employment and labor policy, and improve working lives through undergraduate and graduate education. The school publishes the Industrial and Labor Relations Review and had Frances Perkins on its faculty. The school has six academic departments: Economics, Human Resource Management, International and Comparative Labor, Labor Relations, Organizational Behavior, and Social Statistics. Classes include \\"Politics of the Global North\\" and \\"Economic Analysis of the University.\\" [47][48]\\r\\nLabor unions use the term jurisdiction to refer to their claims to represent workers who perform a certain type of work and the right of their members to perform such work. For example, the work of unloading containerized cargo at United States ports, which the International Longshoremen's Association, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters have claimed rightfully should be assigned to workers they represent. A jurisdictional strike is a concerted refusal to work undertaken by a union to assert its members' right to such job assignments and to protest the assignment of disputed work to members of another union or to unorganized workers. Jurisdictional strikes occur most frequently in the United States in the construction industry.[49]\\r\\nUnions also use jurisdiction to refer to the geographical boundaries of their operations, as in those cases in which a national or international union allocates the right to represent workers among different local unions based on the place of those workers' employment, either along geographical lines or by adopting the boundaries between political jurisdictions.[49]\\r\\nAlthough not as overwhelmingly supportive as it was from the 1930s through the early 1960s, a clear majority of the American public approves of labor unions. The Gallup organization has tracked public opinion of unions since 1936, when it found that 72 percent approved of unions. The overwhelming approval declined in the late 1960s, but - except for one poll in 2009 in which the unions received a favorable rating by only 48 percent of those interviewed, majorities have always supported labor unions. The latest poll in August 2016 gave labor unions a 56 percent approval rating, versus 36 percent who disapproved of unions.\\r\\nOn the question of whether or not unions should have more influence or less influence, Gallup has found the public consistently split since Gallup first posed the question in 2000, with no majority favoring either more influence or less influence. In August 2016, 36 percent wanted unions to have more influence, 34 percent less influence, with 26 percent wanting the influence of labor unions to remain about the same.[50]\\r\\nAlthough most industrialized countries have seen a drop in unionization rates, the drop in union density (the unionized proportion of the working population) has been more significant in the United States than elsewhere.[11]\\r\\nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics surveyed the histories of union membership rates in industrialized countries from 1970 to 2003, and found that of 20 advanced economies which had union density statistics going back to 1970, 16 of them had experienced drops in union density from 1970 to 2003. Over the same period during which union density in the US declined from 23.5 percent to 12.4 percent, some counties saw even steeper drops. Australian unionization fell from 50.2 percent in 1970 to 22.9 percent in 2003, in New Zealand it dropped from 55.2 percent to 22.1 percent, and in Austria union participation fell from 62.8 percent down to 35.4 percent. All the English-speaking countries studied saw union membership decline to some degree. In the United Kingdom, union participation fell from 44.8 percent in 1970 to 29.3 percent in 2003. In Ireland the decline was from 53.7 percent down to 35.3 percent. Canada had one of the smallest declines over the period, going from 31.6 percent in 1970 to 28.4 percent in 2003. Most of the countries studied started in 1970 with higher participation rates than the US, but France, which in 1970 had a union participation rate of 21.7 percent, by 2003 had fallen to 8.3 percent. The remaining four countries which had gained in union density were Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Belgium.[53]\\r\\nPublic approval of unions climbed during the 1980s much as it did in other industrialized nations,[54] but declined to below 50% for the first time in 2009 during the Great Recession. It is not clear if this is a long term trend or a function of a high unemployment rate which historically correlates with lower public approval of labor unions.[55]\\r\\nOne explanation for loss of public support is simply the lack of union power or critical mass. No longer do a sizable percentage of American workers belong to unions, or have family members who do. Unions no longer carry the \\"threat effect\\": the power of unions to raise wages of non-union shops by virtue of the threat of unions to organize those shops.[55]\\r\\nA New York Times/CBS Poll found that 60% of Americans opposed restricting collective bargaining while 33% were for it. The poll also found that 56% of Americans opposed reducing pay of public employees compared to the 37% who approved. The details of the poll also stated that 26% of those surveyed, thought pay and benefits for public employees were too high, 25% thought too low, and 36% thought about right. Mark Tapscott of the Washington Examiner criticized the poll, accusing it of over-sampling union and public employee households.[56]\\r\\nA Gallup poll released on March 9, 2011, showed that Americans were more likely to support limiting the collective bargaining powers of state employee unions to balance a state's budget (49%) than disapprove of such a measure (45%), while 6% had no opinion. 66% of Republicans approved of such a measure as did 51% of independents. Only 31% of Democrats approved.[57]\\r\\nA Gallup poll released on March 11, 2011, showed that nationwide, Americans were more likely to give unions a negative word or phrase when describing them (38%) than a positive word or phrase (34%). 17% were neutral and 12% didn't know. Republicans were much more likely to say a negative term (58%) than Democrats (19%). Democrats were much more likely to say a positive term (49%) than Republicans (18%).[58]\\r\\nA nationwide Gallup poll (margin of error I4%) released on April 1, 2011,[59] showed the following;\\r\\nA nationwide Gallup poll released on August 31, 2011, revealed the following:[60]\\r\\nA nationwide Gallup poll released on September 1, 2011, revealed the following:[61]\\r\\nA broad range of forces have been identified as potential contributors to the drop in union density across countries. Sano and Williamson outline quantitative studies that assess the relevance of these factors across countries.[62] The first relevant set of factors relate to the receptiveness of unions' institutional environments. For example, the presence of a Ghent system (where unions are responsible for the distribution of unemployment insurance) and of centralized collective bargaining (organized at a national or industry level as opposed to local or firm level) have both been shown to give unions more bargaining power and to correlate positively to higher rates of union density.[62]\\r\\nUnions have enjoyed higher rates of success in locations where they have greater access to the workplace as an organizing space (as determined both by law and by employer acceptance), and where they benefit from a corporatist relationship to the state and are thus allowed to participate more directly in the official governance structure. Moreover, the fluctuations of business cycles, particularly the rise and fall of unemployment rates and inflation, are also closely linked to changes in union density.[62]\\r\\nLabor lawyer Thomas Geoghegan attributes the drop to the long-term effects of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, which slowed and then halted labor's growth and then, over many decades, enabled management to roll back labor's previous gains.[63]\\r\\nFirst, it ended organizing on the grand, 1930s scale. It outlawed mass picketing, secondary strikes of neutral employers, sit downs: in short, everything [Congress of Industrial Organizations founder John L.] Lewis did in the 1930s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second effect of Taft-Hartley was subtler and slower-working. It was to hold up any new organizing at all, even on a quiet, low-key scale. For example, Taft-Hartley ended \\"card checks.\\"  Taft-Hartley required hearings, campaign periods, secret-ballot elections, and sometimes more hearings, before a union could be officially recognized.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also allowed and even encouraged employers to threaten workers who want to organize. Employers could hold \\"captive meetings,\\" bring workers into the office and chew them out for thinking about the Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Taft-Hartley led to the \\"union-busting\\" that started in the late 1960s and continues today. It started when a new \\"profession\\" of labor consultants began to convince employers that they could violate the [pro-labor 1935] Wagner Act, fire workers at will, fire them deliberately for exercising their legal rights, and nothing would happen. The Wagner Act had never had any real sanctions.\\r\\n[]\\r\\nIn general, scholars debate the influence of politics in determining union strength in the US and other countries. One argument is that political parties play an expected role in determining union strength, with left-wing governments generally promoting greater union density, while others contest this finding by pointing out important counterexamples and explaining the reverse causality inherent in this relationship.[64]\\r\\nMore recently, as unions have become increasingly concerned with the impacts of market integration on their well-being, scholars have begun to assess whether popular concerns about a global \\"race to the bottom\\" are reflected in cross-country comparisons of union strength. These scholars use foreign direct investment (FDI) and the size of a country's international trade as a percentage of its GDP to assess a country's relative degree of market integration. These researchers typically find that globalization does affect union density, but is dependent on other factors, such as unions' access to the workplace and the centralization of bargaining.[65]\\r\\nSano and Williamson argue that globalization's impact is conditional upon a country's labor history.[66] In the United States in particular, which has traditionally had relatively low levels of union density, globalization did not appear to significantly affect union density.\\r\\nStudies focusing more narrowly on the U.S. labor movement corroborate the comparative findings about the importance of structural factors, but tend to emphasize the effects of changing labor markets due to globalization to a greater extent. Bronfenbrenner notes that changes in the economy, such as increased global competition, capital flight, and the transitions from a manufacturing to a service economy and to a greater reliance on transitory and contingent workers, accounts for only a third of the decline in union density.[68]\\r\\nBronfenbrenner claims that the federal government in the 1980s was largely responsible for giving employers the perception that they could engage in aggressive strategies to repress the formation of unions. Richard Freeman also points to the role of repressive employer strategies in reducing unionization, and highlights the way in which a state ideology of anti-unionism tacitly accepted these strategies [54]\\r\\nGoldfield writes that the overall effects of globalization on unionization in the particular case of the United States may be understated in econometric studies on the subject.[69] He writes that the threat of production shifts reduces unions' bargaining power even if it does not eliminate them, and also claims that most of the effects of globalization on labor's strength are indirect. They are most present in change towards a neoliberal political context that has promoted the deregulation and privatization of some industries and accepted increased employer flexibility in labor markets.\\r\\nRegardless of the actual impact of market integration on union density or on workers themselves, organized labor has been engaged in a variety of strategies to limit the agenda of globalization and to promote labor regulations in an international context. The most prominent example of this has been the opposition of labor groups to free trade initiatives such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). In both cases, unions expressed strong opposition to the agreements, but to some extent pushed for the incorporation of basic labor standards in the agreement if one were to pass.[71]\\r\\nHowever, Mayer has written that it was precisely unions' opposition to NAFTA overall that jeopardized organized labor's ability to influence the debate on labor standards in a significant way.[72] During Clinton's presidential campaign, labor unions wanted NAFTA to include a side deal to provide for a kind of international social charter, a set of standards that would be enforceable both in domestic courts and through international institutions. Mickey Kantor, then U.S. trade representative, had strong ties to organized labor and believed that he could get unions to come along with the agreement, particularly if they were given a strong voice in the negotiation process.[72]\\r\\nWhen it became clear that Mexico would not stand for this kind of an agreement, some critics from the labor movement would not settle for any viable alternatives. In response, part of the labor movement wanted to declare their open opposition to the agreement, and to push for NAFTA's rejection in Congress.[72] Ultimately, the ambivalence of labor groups led those within the Administration who supported NAFTA to believe that strengthening NAFTA's labor side agreement too much would cost more votes among Republicans than it would garner among Democrats, and would make it harder for the United States to elicit support from Mexico.[73]\\r\\nGraubart writes that, despite unions' open disappointment with the outcome of this labor-side negotiation, labor activists, including the AFL-CIO have used the side agreement's citizen petition process to highlight ongoing political campaigns and struggles in their home countries.[74] He claims that despite the relative weakness of the legal provisions themselves, the side-agreement has served a legitimizing functioning, giving certain social struggles a new kind of standing.\\r\\nUnions have recently been engaged in a developing field of transnational labor regulation embodied in corporate codes of conduct. However, O'Brien cautions that unions have been only peripherally involved in this process, and remain ambivalent about its potential effects.[75] They worry that these codes could have legitimizing effects on companies that do not actually live up to good practices, and that companies could use codes to excuse or distract attention from the repression of unions.\\r\\nBraun and Gearhart note that although unions do participate in the structure of a number of these agreements, their original interest in codes of conduct differed from the interests of human rights and other non-governmental activists. Unions believed that codes of conduct would be important first steps in creating written principles that a company would be compelled to comply with in later organizing contracts, but did not foresee the establishment of monitoring systems such as the Fair Labor Association. These authors point out that are motivated by power, want to gain insider status politically and are accountable to a constituency that requires them to provide them with direct benefits.[76]\\r\\nIn contrast, activists from the non-governmental sector are motivated by ideals, are free of accountability and gain legitimacy from being political outsiders. Therefore, the interests of unions are not likely to align well with the interests of those who draft and monitor corporate codes of conduct.\\r\\nArguing against the idea that high union wages necessarily make manufacturing uncompetitive in a globalized economy is labor lawyer Thomas Geoghegan. Busting\\r\\nunions, in the U.S. manner, as the prime way of competing with China and other countries [does not work]. It's no accident that the social democracies, Sweden, France, and Germany, which kept on paying high wages, now have more industry than the U.S. or the UK.  [T]hat's what the U.S. and the UK did: they smashed the unions, in the belief that they had to compete on cost. The result? They quickly ended up wrecking their industrial base.[77]\\r\\nUnions have made some attempts to organize across borders. Eder observes that transnational organizing is not a new phenomenon but has been facilitated by technological change.[78] Nevertheless, he claims that while unions pay lip service to global solidarity, they still act largely in their national self-interest. He argues that unions in the global North are becoming increasingly depoliticized while those in the South grow politically, and that global differentiation of production processes leads to divergent strategies and interests in different regions of the world. These structural differences tend to hinder effective global solidarity. However, in light of the weakness of international labor, Herod writes that globalization of production need not be met by a globalization of union strategies in order to be contained. Herod also points out that local strategies, such as the United Auto Workers' strike against General Motors in 1998, can sometimes effectively interrupt global production processes in ways that they could not before the advent of widespread market integration. Thus, workers need not be connected organizationally to others around the world to effectively influence the behavior of a transnational corporation.[79]\\r\\nHistory:\\r\\nInternational:\\r\\nGeneral:","input":"When was the first union formed in the united states?"},{"output":"23 June 1757","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n?Great Britain\\r\\n\\r\\nMughal Empire\\r\\n\\r\\n Colonel Robert Clive\\r\\n\\r\\nNawab Siraj ud-Daulah\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Battle of Plassey  was a decisive victory of the British East India Company over the Nawab of Bengal and his French[1] allies on 23 June 1757, under the leadership of Robert Clive. The battle consolidated the Company's presence in Bengal, which later expanded to cover much of India over the next hundred years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battle took place at Palashi (Anglicised version: Plassey) on the banks of the Hooghly River, about 150 kilometres (93?mi) north of Calcutta and south of Murshidabad, then capital of Bengal (now in Murshidabad district in West Bengal). The belligerents were the Nawab Siraj-ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, and the British East India Company. Siraj-ud-daulah had become the Nawab of Bengal the year before, and he ordered the English to stop the extension of their fortification. Robert Clive bribed Mir Jafar, the commander-in-chief of the Nawab's army, and also promised him to make him Nawab of Bengal. Clive defeated Siraj-ud-daulah at Plassey in 1757 and captured Calcutta.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battle was preceded by an attack on British-controlled Calcutta by Nawab Siraj-ud-daulah and the Black Hole massacre. The British sent reinforcements under Colonel Robert Clive and Admiral Charles Watson from Madras to Bengal and recaptured Calcutta. Clive then seized the initiative to capture the French fort of Chandernagar.[3] Tensions and suspicions between Siraj-ud-daulah and the British culminated in the Battle of Plassey. The battle was waged during the Seven Years' War (1756ÿ1763), and, in a mirror of their European rivalry, the French East India Company (La Compagnie des Indes Orientales)[1] sent a small contingent to fight against the British. Siraj-ud-Daulah had a numerically superior force and made his stand at Plassey. The British, worried about being outnumbered, formed a conspiracy with Siraj-ud-Daulah's demoted army chief Mir Jafar, along with others such as Yar Lutuf Khan, Jagat Seths (Mahtab Chand and Swarup Chand), Umichand and Rai Durlabh. Mir Jafar, Rai Durlabh and Yar Lutuf Khan thus assembled their troops near the battlefield but made no move to actually join the battle. Siraj-ud-Daulah's army with 50,000 soldiers, 40 cannons and 10 war elephants was defeated by 3,000 soldiers of Col. Robert Clive, owing to the flight of Siraj-ud-daulah from the battlefield and the inactivity of the conspirators. The battle ended in 11 hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is judged to be one of the pivotal battles in the control of Indian subcontinent by the colonial powers. The British now wielded enormous influence over the Nawab and consequently acquired significant concessions for previous losses and revenue from trade. The British further used this revenue to increase their military might and push the other European colonial powers such as the Dutch and the French out of South Asia, thus expanding the British Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British East India Company had a strong presence in India with the three main stations of Fort St. George in Madras, Fort William in Calcutta and Bombay Castle in western India. These stations were independent presidencies governed by a president and a council, appointed by the Court of Directors in England. The British adopted a policy of allying themselves with various princes and Nawabs, promising security against usurpers and rebels. The Nawabs often gave them concessions in return for the security. By the 18th century all rivalry had ceased between the British East India Company and the Dutch or Portuguese counterparts. The French had also established an East India Company under Louis XIV and had two important stations in India?ÿ Chandernagar in Bengal and Pondicherry on the Carnatic coast, both governed by the presidency of Pondicherry. The French were a late comer in India trade, but they quickly established themselves in India and were poised to overtake Britain for control.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe War of the Austrian Succession (1740ÿ1748) marked the beginning of the power struggle between Britain and France and of European military ascendancy and political intervention in the Indian subcontinent. In September 1746, Mah de La Bourdonnais landed off Madras with a naval squadron and laid siege to the port city. The defences of Madras were weak and the garrison sustained a bombardment of three days before surrendering. The terms of the surrender agreed by Bourdonnais provided for the settlement to be ransomed back for a cash payment by the British East India Company. However, this concession was opposed by Joseph Fran?ois Dupleix, the governor general of the Indian possessions of the Compagnie des Indes Orientales. When Bourdonnais left India in October, Dupleix reneged on the agreement. The Nawab of the Carnatic Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan intervened in support of the British and the combined forces advanced to retake Madras, but despite vast superiority in numbers, the army was easily crushed by the French. As retaliation to the loss of Madras, the British, under Major Lawrence and Admiral Boscawen, laid siege to Pondicherry but were forced to raise it after thirty-one days. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 forced Dupleix to yield Madras back to the British in return for Louisbourg and Cape Breton Island in North America.[4][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Treaty of Aix-La-Chapelle prevented direct hostilities between the two powers but soon they were involved in indirect hostilities as the auxiliaries of the local princes in their feuds. The feud Dupleix chose was for the succession to the positions of the Nizam of the Deccan and the Nawab of the dependent Carnatic province. The British and the French both nominated their candidates for the two posts. In both cases, Dupleix's candidates usurped both thrones by manipulation and two assassinations. In mid-1751, the French candidate for the Nawab's post, Chanda Sahib, laid siege to the British candidate Mohammed Ali's last stronghold Trichinopoly, where Ali was holed up with his British reinforcements. He was aided by a French force under Charles, Marquis de Bussy.[4][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 September 1751, 280 Europeans and 300 sepoys under the command of Captain Robert Clive attacked and seized Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic, finding that the garrison had fled the night before. It was hoped that this would force Chanda Sahib to divert some of his troops to wrest the city back from the British. Chanda Sahib sent a force of 4,000 Indians under Raza Sahib and 150 Frenchmen. They besieged the fort and breached the walls in various places after several weeks. Clive sent out a message to Morari Rao, a Maratha chieftain who had received a subsidy to assist Mohammed Ali and was encamped in the Mysore hills. Raza Sahib, learning of the imminent Maratha approach, sent a letter to Clive asking him to surrender in return for a large sum of money but this offer was refused. In the morning of 24 November, Raza Sahib tried to mount a final assault on the fort but was foiled in his attempt when his armoured elephants stampeded due to the British musketry. They tried to enter the fort through the breach several times but always repulsed with loss. The siege was raised the next day and Raza Sahib's forces fled from the scene, abandoning guns, ammunition and stores. With success at Arcot, Conjeeveram and Trichinopoly, the British secured the Carnatic and Mohammed Ali succeeded to the throne of the Nawab in accordance with a treaty with the new French governor Godeheu.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlwardi Khan ascended to the throne of the Nawab of Bengal after his army attacked and captured the capital of Bengal, Murshidabad. Alivardi's attitude to the Europeans in Bengal is said to be strict. During his wars with the Marathas, he allowed the strengthening of fortifications by the Europeans and the construction of the Maratha Ditch in Calcutta by the British. On the other hand, he collected large amounts of money from them for the upkeep of his war. He was well-informed of the situation in southern India, where the British and the French had started a proxy war using the local princes and rulers. Alwardi did not wish such a situation to transpire in his province and thus exercised caution in his dealings with the Europeans. However, there was continual friction; the British always complained that they were prevented from the full enjoyment of the farman of 1717 issued by Farrukhsiyar. The British, however, protected subjects of the Nawab, gave passes to native traders to trade custom-free and levied large duties on goods coming to their districts?ÿ actions which were detrimental to the Nawab's revenue.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 1756, Alwardi Khan died and was succeeded by his twenty-three-year-old grandson, Siraj-ud-daulah. His personality was said to be a combination of a ferocious temper and a feeble understanding. He was particularly suspicious of the large profits made by the European companies in India. When the British and the French started improving their fortifications in anticipation of another war between them, he immediately ordered them to stop such activities as they had been done without permission.[10] When the British refused to cease their constructions, the Nawab led a detachment of 3,000 men to surround the fort and factory of Cossimbazar and took several British officials as prisoners, before moving to Calcutta.[11] The defences of Calcutta were weak and negligible. The garrison consisted of only 180 soldiers, 50 European volunteers, 60 European militia, 150 Armenian and Portuguese militia, 35 European artillery-men and 40 volunteers from ships and was pitted against the Nawab's force of nearly 50,000 infantry and cavalry. The city was occupied on 16 June by Siraj's force and the fort surrendered after a brief siege on 20 June.[12][13][14][15][16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prisoners who were captured at the siege of Calcutta were transferred by Siraj to the care of the officers of his guard, who confined them to the common dungeon of Fort William known as The Black Hole. This dungeon, 18 by 14 feet (5.5?m G?4.3?m) in size with two small windows, had 146 prisoners thrust into it?ÿ originally employed by the British to hold only six prisoners. On 21 June, the doors of the dungeon were opened and only 23 of the 146 walked out, the rest died of asphyxiation, heat exhaustion and delirium.[18] It appears that the Nawab was unaware of the conditions in which his prisoners were held which resulted in the unfortunate deaths of most of the prisoners. Meanwhile, the Nawab's army and navy were busy plundering the city of Calcutta and the other British factories in the surrounding areas.[19][20][21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen news of the fall of Calcutta broke in Madras on 16 August 1756, the Council immediately sent out an expeditionary force under Colonel Clive and Admiral Watson. A letter from the Council of Fort St. George, states that \\"the object of the expedition was not merely to re-establish the British settlements in Bengal, but also to obtain ample recognition of the Company's privileges and reparation for its losses\\" without the risk of war. It also states that any signs of dissatisfaction and ambition among the Nawab's subjects must be supported.[23] Clive assumed command of the land forces, consisting of 900 Europeans and 1500 sepoys while Watson commanded a naval squadron. The fleet entered the Hooghly River in December and met with the fugitives of Calcutta and the surrounding areas, including the principal Members of the Council, at the village of Falta on 15 December. The Members of Council formed a Select Committee of direction. On 29 December, the force dislodged the enemy from the fort of Budge Budge. Clive and Watson then moved against Calcutta on 2 January 1757 and the garrison of 500 men surrendered after offering a scanty resistance.[24] With Calcutta recaptured, the Council was reinstated and a plan of action against the Nawab was prepared. The fortifications of Fort William were strengthened and a defensive position was prepared in the north-east of the city.[21][25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 9 January 1757, a force of 650 men under Captain Coote and Major Kilpatrick stormed and sacked the town of Hooghly, 23 miles (37?km) north of Calcutta.[27] On learning of this attack, the Nawab raised his army and marched on Calcutta, arriving with the main body on 3 February and encamping beyond the Maratha Ditch. Siraj set up his headquarters in Omichund's garden. A small body of their army attacked the northern suburbs of the town but were beaten back by a detachment under Lieutenant Lebeaume placed there, returning with fifty prisoners.[28][29][30][31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nClive decided to launch a surprise attack on the Nawab's camp on the morning of 4 February. At midnight, a force of 600 sailors, a battalion of 650 Europeans, 100 artillery-men, 800 sepoys and 6 six-pounders approached the Nawab's camp. At 6:00, under the cover of a thick fog, the vanguard came upon the Nawab's advanced guard, who after firing with their matchlocks and rockets, ran away. They continued forward for some distance till they were opposite Omichund's garden, when they heard the galloping of cavalry on their right. The cavalry came within 30 yards (27?m) of the British force before the line gave fire, killing many and dispersing the rest. The fog hampered visibility beyond walking distance. Hence, the line moved slowly, infantry and artillery firing on either side randomly. Clive had intended to use a narrow raised causeway, south of the garden, to attack the Nawab's quarters in the garden. The Nawab's troops had barricaded the passage. At about 9:00, as the fog began to lift, the troops were overwhelmed by the discharge of two pieces of heavy cannon from across the Maratha Ditch by the Nawab's artillery. The British troops were assailed on all sides by cavalry and musket-fire. The Nawab troops then made for a bridge a mile further on, crossed the Maratha Ditch and reached Calcutta. The total casualties of Clive's force were 57 killed and 137 wounded. The Nawab's army lost 22 officers of distinction, 600 common men, 4 elephants, 500 horses, some camels and a great number of bullocks. The attack scared the Nawab into concluding the Treaty of Alinagar with the Company on 5 February, agreeing to restore the Company's factories, allow the fortification of Calcutta and restoring former privileges. The Nawab withdrew his army back to his capital, Murshidabad.[33][34][35][36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerned by the approach of de Bussy to Bengal and the Seven Years' War in Europe, the Company turned its attention to the French threat in Bengal. Clive planned to capture the French town of Chandernagar, 20 miles (32?km) north of Calcutta. Clive needed to know whose side the Nawab would intervene on if he attacked Chandernagar. The Nawab sent evasive replies and Clive construed this to be assent to the attack.[38] Clive commenced hostilities on the town and fort of Chandernagar on 14 March. The French had set up defences on the roads leading to the fort and had sunk several ships in the river channel to prevent passage of the men of war. The garrison consisted of 600 Europeans and 300 sepoys. The French expected assistance from the Nawab's forces from Hooghly, but the governor of Hooghly, Nandkumar had been bribed to remain inactive and prevent the Nawab's reinforcement of Chandernagar. The fort was well-defended, but when Admiral Watson's squadron forced the blockade in the channel on 23 March, a fierce cannonade ensued with aid from two batteries on the shore. The naval squadron suffered greatly due to musket-fire from the fort. At 9:00 on 24 March, a flag of truce was shown by the French and by 15:00, the capitulation concluded. After plundering Chandernagar, Clive decided to ignore his orders to return to Madras and remain in Bengal. He moved his army to the north of the town of Hooghly.[35][39][40][41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, Siraj-ud-Daula believed that the British East India Company did not receive any permission from the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II to fortify their positions in the territories of the Nawab of Bengal.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nawab was infuriated on learning of the attack on Chandernagar. His former hatred of the British returned, but he now felt the need to strengthen himself by alliances against the British. The Nawab was plagued by fear of attack from the north by the Afghans under Ahmad Shah Durrani and from the west by the Marathas. Therefore, he could not deploy his entire force against the British for fear of being attacked from the flanks. A deep distrust set in between the British and the Nawab. As a result, Siraj started secret negotiations with Jean Law, chief of the French factory at Cossimbazar, and de Bussy. The Nawab also moved a large division of his army under Rai Durlabh to Plassey, on the island of Cossimbazar 30 miles (48?km) south of Murshidabad.[35][44][45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nPopular discontent against the Nawab flourished in his own court. The Seths, the traders of Bengal, were in perpetual fear for their wealth under the reign of Siraj, contrary to the situation under Alivardi's reign. They had engaged Yar Lutuf Khan to defend them in case they were threatened in any way.[47] William Watts, the Company representative at the court of Siraj, informed Clive about a conspiracy at the court to overthrow the ruler. The conspirators included Mir Jafar, paymaster of the army, Rai Durlabh, Yar Lutuf Khan and Omichund, a merchant and several officers in the army.[48] When communicated in this regard by Mir Jafar, Clive referred it to the select committee in Calcutta on 1 May. The committee passed a resolution in support of the alliance. A treaty was drawn between the British and Mir Jafar to raise him to the throne of the Nawab in return for support to the British in the field of battle and the bestowal of large sums of money upon them as compensation for the attack on Calcutta. On 2 May, Clive broke up his camp and sent half the troops to Calcutta and the other half to Chandernagar.[49][50][51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nMir Jafar and the Seths desired that the confederacy between the British and himself be kept secret from Omichund, but when he found out about it, he threatened to betray the conspiracy if his share was not increased to three million rupees (S300,000). Hearing of this, Clive suggested an expedient to the Committee. He suggested that two treaties be drawn?ÿ the real one on white paper, containing no reference to Omichund and the other on red paper, containing Omichund's desired stipulation, to deceive him. The Members of the Committee signed on both treaties, but Admiral Watson signed only the real one and his signature had to be counterfeited on the fictitious one.[53] Both treaties and separate articles for donations to the army, navy squadron and committee were signed by Mir Jafar on 4 June.[54][55][56][57]\\r\\n\\r\\nClive testified and defended himself thus before the House of Commons of Parliament on 10 May 1773, during the Parliamentary inquiry into his conduct in India:\\r\\n\\r\\nOmichund, his confidential servant, as he thought, told his master of an agreement made between the English and Monsieur Dupre [may be a mistranscription of Dupleix] to attack him, and received for that advice a sum of not less than four lacks of rupees. Finding this to be the man in whom the nabob entirely trusted, it soon became our object to consider him as a most material engine in the intended revolution. We therefore made such an agreement as was necessary for the purpose, and entered into a treaty with him to satisfy his demands. When all things were prepared, and the evening of the event was appointed, Omichund informed Mr. Watts, who was at the court of the nabob, that he insisted upon thirty lacks of rupees, and five per cent. upon all the treasure that should be found; that, unless that was immediately complied with, he would disclose the whole to the nabob; and that Mr. Watts, and the two other English gentlemen then at the court, should be cut off before the morning. Mr. Watts, immediately on this information, dispatched an express to me at the council. I did not hesitate to find out a stratagem to save the lives of these people, and secure success to the intended event. For this purpose we signed another treaty. The one was called the Red, the other the White treaty. This treaty was signed by every one, except admiral Watson; and I should have considered myself sufficiently authorised to put his name to it, by the conversation I had with him. As to the person who signed admiral Watson's name to the treaty, whether he did it in his presence or not, I cannot say; but this I know, that he thought he had sufficient authority for so doing. This treaty was immediately sent to Omichund, who did not suspect the stratagem. The event took place, and success attended it; and the House, I am fully persuaded, will agree with me, that, when the very existence of the Company was at stake, and the lives of these people so precariously situated, and so certain of being destroyed, it was a matter of true policy and of justice to deceive so great a villain.[58][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 June, Clive was joined by Major Kilpatrick with the rest of the army from Calcutta at Chandernagar. The combined force consisted of 613 Europeans, 171 artillery-men controlling eight field pieces and two howitzers, 91 topasses, 2100 sepoys (mainly dusadhs)[60][61] and 150 sailors. The army set out for Murshidabad on 13 June. Clive sent out the Nawab's messengers with a letter declaring his intention to march his army to Murshidabad to refer their complaints with regard to the treaty of 9 February with the principal officers of the Nawab's government. The Indian troops marched on shore while the Europeans with the supplies and artillery were towed up the river in 200 boats. On 14 June, Clive sent a declaration of war to Siraj. On 15 June, after ordering an attack on Mir Jafar's palace in suspicion of his alliance with the British, Siraj obtained a promise from Mir Jafar to not join the British in the field of battle.[62] He then ordered his entire army to move to Plassey, but the troops refused to quit the city until the arrears of their pay were released. The delay caused the army to reach Plassey only by 21 June.[63][64][65][66]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 16 June, the British force had reached Paltee, 12 miles (19?km) north of which lay the strategically important town and fort of Katwa. It contained large stores of grain and military supplies and was covered by the river Aji. On 17 June, Clive despatched a force of 200 Europeans, 500 sepoys, one field piece and a small howitzer under Major Coote of the 39th Foot to capture the fort. The detachment found the town abandoned when they landed at midnight. At daybreak on 19 June, Major Coote went to the bank of the river and waved a white flag, but was met only by shot and a show of defiance by the governor. Coote split his Anglo-Indian force; the sepoys crossed the river and fired the ramparts while the Europeans crossed farther up from the fort. When the garrison saw the advancing troops, they gave up their posts and fled north. Hearing of the success, Clive and the rest of the army arrived at Katwa by the evening of 19 June.[65][67][68]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this juncture, Clive faced a dilemma. The Nawab had reconciled with Mir Jafar and had posted him on one flank of his army. Mir Jafar had sent messages to Clive, declaring his intention to uphold the treaty between them. Clive decided to refer the problem to his officers and held a council of war on 21 June. The question Clive put before them was whether, under the present circumstances, the army, without other assistance, should immediately cross into the island of Cossimbazar and attack the Nawab or whether they should fortify their position in Katwa and trust to assistance from the Marathas or other Indian powers. Of the twenty officers attending the council, thirteen including Clive were against immediate action, while the rest including Major Coote were in favour citing recent success and the high spirits of the troops. The council broke up and after an hour of deliberation, Clive gave the army orders to cross the Bhagirathi River (another name for the Hooghly River) on the morning of 22 June.[69][70][71][72][73]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 1:00, on 23 June, they reached their destination beyond the village of Plassey. They quickly occupied the adjoining mango grove, called Laksha Bagh, which was 800 yards (730?m) long and 300 yards (270?m) wide and enclosed by a ditch and a mud wall. Its length was angled diagonally to the Bhagirathi River. A little to the north of the grove at the bank of the river stood a hunting lodge enclosed by a masonry wall where Clive took up his quarters. The grove was about a mile from the Nawab's entrenchments. The Nawab's army had been in place 26 hours before Clive's. A French detachment under Jean Law would reach Plassey in two days. Their army lay behind earthen entrenchments running at right angles to the river for 200 yards (180?m) and then turning to the north-eastern direction for 3 miles (4.8?km). There was a redoubt mounted by cannon at this turning along the entrenchment. There was a small hill covered by trees 300 yards (270?m) east of the redoubt. 800 yards (730?m) towards the British position was a small tank (reservoir) and 100 yards (91?m) further south was a larger tank, both surrounded by a large mound of earth.[74][75][76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt daybreak on 23 June, the Nawab's army emerged from their camp and started advancing towards the grove. Their army consisted of 30,000 infantry of all sorts, armed with matchlocks, swords, pikes and rockets and 20,000 cavalry, armed with swords or long spears, interspersed by 300 pieces of artillery, mostly 32, 24 and 18-pounders. The army also included a detachment of about 50 French artillerymen under de St. Frais directing their own field pieces. The French took up positions at the larger tank with four light pieces advanced by two larger pieces, within a mile of the grove. Behind them were a body of 5,000 cavalry and 7,000 infantry commanded by the Nawab's faithful general Mir madan  Khan and Diwan Mohanlal. The rest of the army numbering 45,000 formed an arc from the small hill to a position 800 yards (730?m) east of the southern angle of the grove, threatening to surround Clive's relatively smaller army. The right arm of their army was commanded by Rai Durlabh, the centre by Yar Lutuf Khan and the left arm closest to the British by Mir Jafar.[78][79][80]\\r\\n\\r\\nClive watched the situation unfolding from the roof of the hunting lodge, anticipating news from Mir Jafar. He ordered his troops to advance from the grove and line up facing the larger tank. His army consisted of 750 European infantry with 100 Topasses, 2100 sepoys (dusadhs)[60] and 100 artillery-men assisted by 50 sailors. The artillery consisted of eight 6-pounders and two howitzers. The Europeans and Topasses were placed in the centre of the line in four divisions, flanked on both sides by three 6-pounders. The sepoys were placed on the right and left in equal divisions. Clive posted two 6-pounders and two howitzers behind some brick-kilns 200 yards (180?m) north of the left division of his army to oppose the French fire.[81][82][83]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 8:00, the French artillery at the larger tank fired the first shot, killing one and wounding another from the grenadier company of the 39th Regiment. This, as a signal, the rest of the Nawab's artillery started a heavy and continuous fire. The advanced field pieces of the British opposed the French fire, while those with the battalion opposed the rest of the Nawab's artillery. Their shots did not serve to immobilize the artillery but hit the infantry and cavalry divisions. By 8:30, the British had lost 10 Europeans and 20 sepoys. Leaving the advanced artillery at the brick kilns, Clive ordered the army to retreat back to relative shelter of the grove. The rate of casualties of the British dropped substantially due to the protection of the embankment.[84][85][86]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of three hours, there was no substantial progress and the positions of both sides had not changed. Clive called a meeting of his staff to discuss the way ahead. It was concluded that the present position would be maintained till after nightfall, and an attack on the Nawab's camp should be attempted at midnight. Soon after the conference, a heavy rainstorm occurred. The British used tarpaulins to protect their ammunition, while the Nawab's army took no such precautions. As a result, their gunpowder got drenched and their rate of fire slackened, while Clive's artillery kept up a continuous fire. As the rain began to subside, Mir Madan Khan, assuming that the British guns were rendered ineffective by the rain, led his cavalry to a charge. However, the British countered the charge with heavy grape shot, mortally wounding Mir Madan Khan and driving back his men.[87][88][89][90]\\r\\n\\r\\nSiraj had remained in his tent throughout the cannonade surrounded by attendants and officers assuring him of victory. When he heard that Mir Madan was mortally wounded, he was deeply disturbed and attempted reconciliation with Mir Jafar, flinging his turban to the ground, entreating him to defend it. Mir Jafar promised his services but immediately sent word of this encounter to Clive, urging him to push forward. Following Mir Jafar's exit from the Nawab's tent, Rai Durlabh urged Siraj to withdraw his army behind the entrenchment and advised him to return to Murshidabad leaving the battle to his generals. Siraj complied with this advice and ordered the troops under Mohan Lal to retreat behind the entrenchment. He then mounted a camel and accompanied by 2,000 horsemen set out for Murshidabad.[91][92][93][94]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt about 14:00, the Nawab's army ceased the cannonade and began turning back north to their entrenchments, leaving St. Frais and his artillery without support. Seeing the Nawab's forces retiring, Major Kilpatrick, who had been left in charge of the British force while Clive was resting in the hunting lodge, recognised the opportunity to cannonade the retiring enemy if St. Frais' position could be captured. Sending an officer to Clive to explain his actions, he took two companies of the 39th Regiment and two field pieces and advanced towards St. Frais' position. When Clive received the message, he hurried to the detachment and reprimanded Kilpatrick for his actions without orders and commanded to bring up the rest of the army from the grove. Clive himself then led the army against St. Frais' position which was taken at 15:00 when the French artillery retreated to the redoubt of the entrenchment, setting up for further action.[94][95][96][97]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the British force moved towards the larger tank, it was observed that the left arm of the Nawab's army had lingered behind the rest. When the rear of this division reached a point in a line with the northern point of the grove, it turned left and marched towards the grove. Clive, unaware that it was Mir Jafar's division, supposed that his baggage and stores were the intended target and sent three platoons under Captain Grant and Lieutenant Rumbold and a field piece under John Johnstone, a volunteer, to check their advance. The fire of the field piece halted the advance of the division, which remained isolated from the rest of the Nawab's army.[98][99][100]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the British field pieces began a cannonade on the Nawab's camp from the mound of the larger tank. As a result, many of the Nawab's troops and artillery started coming out of the entrenchment. Clive advanced half of his troops and artillery to the smaller tank and the other half to a rising ground 200 yards (180?m) to the left of it and started bombarding the entrenchment with greater efficiency, throwing the approaching trains into confusion. The Nawab's troops shot their matchlocks from holes, ditches, hollows and from bushes on the hill east of the redoubt while St. Frais kept up his artillery fire from the redoubt. Cavalry charges were also repulsed by the British field pieces. However, the British force sustained most of its casualties in this phase.[101][102][103]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point, Clive realised that the lingering division was Mir Jafar's and concentrated his efforts at capturing the redoubt and hill east of it. Clive ordered a three-pronged attack with simultaneous attacks by two detachments on the redoubt and the hill supported by the main force in the centre. Two companies of grenadiers of the 39th Regiment, under Major Coote took the hill at 16:30 after the enemy fled without firing a shot. Coote pursued them across the entrenchment. The redoubt was also taken after St. Frais was forced to retreat. By 17:00, the British occupied the entrenchment and the camp left by a dispersing army. The British troops marched on and halted 6 miles (9.7?km) beyond Daudpur at 20:00.[104][105][106]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British losses were estimated at 22 killed and 50 wounded. Of the killed, three were of the Madras Artillery, one of the Madras Regiment and one of the Bengal European Regiment. Of the wounded, four were of the 39th Regiment, three of the Madras Regiment, four of the Madras Artillery, two of the Bengal European Regiment, one of the Bengal Artillery and one of the Bombay Regiment. Of the losses by the sepoys, four Madras and nine Bengal sepoys were killed while nineteen Madras and eleven Bengal sepoys were wounded. Clive estimates that the Nawab's force lost 500 men, including several key officers.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening of 23 June, Clive received a letter from Mir Jafar asking for a meeting with him. Clive replied that he would meet Mir Jafar at Daudpur the next morning. When Mir Jafar arrived at the British camp at Daudpur in the morning, Clive embraced him and saluted him as the Nawab of Bengal, Bihar and Odisha. He then advised Mir Jafar to hasten to Murshidabad to prevent Siraj's escape and the plunder of his treasure. Mir Jafar reached Murshidabad with his troops on the evening of 24 June. Clive arrived at Murshidabad on 29 June with a guard of 200 European soldiers and 300 sepoys in the wake of rumours of a possible attempt on his life. Clive was taken to the Nawab's palace, where he was received by Mir Jafar and his officers. Clive placed Mir Jafar on the throne and acknowledging his position as Nawab, presented him with a plate of gold rupees.[108][109]\\r\\n\\r\\nSiraj-ud-daulah had reached Murshidabad at midnight on 23 June. He summoned a council where some advised him to surrender to the British, some to continue the war and some to prolong his flight. At 22:00 on 24 June, Siraj disguised himself and escaped northwards on a boat with his wife and valuable jewels. His intention was to escape to Patna with aid from Jean Law. At midnight on 24 June, Mir Jafar sent several parties in pursuit of Siraj. On 2 July, Siraj reached Rajmahal and took shelter in a deserted garden but was soon discovered and betrayed to the local military governor, the brother of Mir Jafar, by a man who was previously arrested and punished by Siraj. His fate could not be decided by a council headed by Mir Jafar and was handed over to Mir Jafar's son, Miran, who had Siraj murdered that night. His remains were paraded on the streets of Murshidabad the next morning and were buried at the tomb of Alivardi Khan.[110][111][112]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the treaty drawn between the British and Mir Jafar, the British acquired all the land within the Maratha Ditch and 600 yards (550?m) beyond it and the zamindari of all the land between Calcutta and the sea. Besides confirming the firman of 1717, the treaty also required the restitution, including donations to the navy squadron, army and committee, of 22,000,000 rupees (S2,750,000) to the British for their losses. However, since the wealth of Siraj-ud-daulah proved to be far less than expected, a council held with the Seths and Rai Durlabh on 29 June decided that one half of the amount was to be paid immediately?ÿ two-thirds in coin and one third in jewels and other valuables. As the council ended, it was revealed to Omichund that he would receive nothing with regard to the treaty, hearing which he went insane.[113][114]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the war of Plassey, the French were no longer a significant force in Bengal. In 1759, the British defeated a larger French garrison at Masulipatam, securing the Northern Circars. By 1759, Mir Jafar felt that his position as a subordinate to the British could not be tolerated. He started encouraging the Dutch to advance against the British and eject them from Bengal. In late 1759, the Dutch sent seven large ships and 1400 men from Java to Bengal under the pretext of reinforcing their Bengal settlement of Chinsura even though Britain and Holland were not officially at war. Clive, however, initiated immediate offensive operations by land and sea and defeated the much larger Dutch force on 25 November 1759 in the Battle of Chinsura. The British then deposed Mir Jafar and installed Mir Qasim as the Nawab of Bengal. The British were now the paramount European power in Bengal. When Clive returned to England due to ill-health, he was rewarded with an Irish peerage, as Lord Clive, Baron of Plassey and also obtained a seat in the British House of Commons.[115][116]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe struggle continued in areas of the Deccan and Hyderabad such as Arcot, Wandewash, Tanjore and Cuddalore, culminating in 1761 when Col. Eyre Coote defeated a French garrison under de Lally, supported by Hyder Ali at Pondicherry. The French were returned Pondicherry in 1763 by way of the Treaty of Paris but they never again regained their former stature in India. The British would, in effect, emerge as rulers of the subcontinent in subsequent years.[117][118]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Battle of Plassey and the resultant victory of the British East India company led to puppet governments instated by them in various states of India. This led to an unleashing of excesses, malpractices and atrocities by the British East India Company in the name of tax collection.[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nA monument was established in the battlefield, named the Palashi Monument.\\r\\n\\r\\nObelisks of Mirmadan, Nabe Singh Hajari & Bahadur Khan near Palashi battlefield\\r\\n\\r\\nPlassey Monument in the battlefield\\r\\n\\r\\nMir Madan's Tomb, Faridpur, Murshidabad","input":"When was the first battle of plassey fought?"},{"output":"March 2011","context":"\\"Who Says\\" is a song performed by American band Selena Gomez & the Scene. Priscilla Renea wrote the song with Emanuel Kiriakou, who produced the track. The song was released in March 2011, as the lead single from the band's third album, When the Sun Goes Down (2011). According to Gomez, the song was intended to inspire people, and fire back at the \\"haters\\", particularly those involved in cyberbullying. \\"Who Says\\" marks a distinct departure in sound for the band, as it has an acoustic and organic feel, compared to their dance-pop and club-oriented previous singles.\\r\\n\\"Who Says\\" received generally positive reviews from critics, who appreciated its message and the change of pace for the band. The song charted in the top thirty in the United States, Canada and New Zealand, and it became their highest charting single on these charts at the time. It also reached the lower regions of European charts. \\"Who Says\\" was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It also became the act's third No. 1 Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs. The song's accompanying music video features Gomez frolicking around a city, removing makeup, and performing with the band on a beach. Gomez performed the song on a variety occasions including at the 2011 MuchMusic Video Awards, on Dancing with the Stars, and So Random!.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, the band released their debut album Kiss & Tell and quickly followed-up with 2010's A Year Without Rain.[1] After the release of the latter, Gomez said that she was not in a rush to release another album, but after hearing \\"Who Says\\", she decided to begin another release, calling the song \\"amazing\\" and crediting it for inspiring her.[1] Gomez would later call the song \\"fun and empowering\\", commenting, \\"Every time I sing this song, I'm like, 'I feel better already!'\\"[1] When talking about the song's message, Gomez commented that she thought of it as \\"sweet\\", going on to say, \\"with bullying, with cyberbullying, with all the negativity that is in high school and dealing with things, you're already trying to figure out who you are; it doesn't help when people are constantly trying to tear you down.\\"[1] She then said that she was \\"dealing with it, of course\\" and was \\"going through it as well.\\"[1] After debuting the single on On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Gomez mentioned the criticism received on Twitter and Facebook due to being a celebrity.\\r\\nTwitter and Facebook are really negative for me? within that world is such easy access to people's feelings.

The fact that all these artists are doing that, it's really good. I'm really happy.\\"[1] The song was released on iTunes in the United States and Canada on March 14, 2011.[3] It was released as a CD single in Germany on March 15, 2011, with the B-side of \\"Ghost of You\\" from A Year Without Rain.[4]\\r\\nThe song is a departure in her previous singles such as \\"Round & Round\\" and \\"Naturally\\", whereas the previous were dance-pop and club-oriented, \\"Who Says\\" has an \\"organic\\" and \\"acoustic\\" feel.[5] According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, \\"Who Says\\" is set in common time in a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major as Gomez's vocal range spans from the low-note of G#3 to the high-note of E5.[6] The song contains string accents described as \\"sympathetic, but not overpowering.\\"[7] Described as a \\"jangly pop tune\\", having an \\"overarching feel-good vibe\\", lyrically, the song speaks of \\"embracing who you are and not letting your critics get you down.\\"[5] Gomez sings of insecurities, and people telling her she is not good enough, before asserting \\"I'm sure you got some things/ You'd like to change about yourself/ But when it comes to me/ I wouldn't want to be anybody else.\\"[5]\\r\\nAccording to Brian Voerding of AOL Radio Blog, \\"Gomez sings about staying true to herself, particularly in the face of doubt that comes from others telling her she can't live up to her dreams.\\" In the song she refers to her criticisms as \\"the price of beauty\\".[8] Bill Lamb of About.com said the song's positive message is \\"all about recognizing yourself as a beautiful person despite what others might say or think.\\"[7]\\r\\nJocelyn Vena of MTV News complimented the song, commenting that \\"Top 40 has a new empowerment anthem.\\"[5] Bill Lamb of About.com said Gomez \\"has become the most consistent Disney pop hitmaker in recent years\\" and that \\"she has not reached these achievements through gimmickry or pandering to an audience.

An thirty-six second teaser of the video was released on March 9, 2011 and the video premiered on VEVO on March 11, 2011.[19] The video starts off with Gomez in a black dress at a photoshoot where she starts singing the first verse. She then removes her earrings and black high heels and exits the studio. Gomez is seen singing while walking barefoot through a city while carrying her black high heels in her hand, riding in a cab and eventually walking on the outskirts of the city as lyrics appear in various locations including a theatre marquee, the side of a building, and written in the sky. Eventually she enters a public restroom where she changes into casual clothing, throws away the black dress and removes her make-up. After this, Gomez makes her way to a beach, where she is seen singing with her band, surrounded by fans. The video ends as the crowd runs into the water, and the waves wash away the words 'THE END' written in the sand.\\r\\nGomez appeared on both the Late Show with David Letterman on March 16, 2011,[20] and The Seven on March 18, 2011 to promote the single.[21] The band performed the song for the first time at the 3rd annual Concert for Hope on March 20, 2011.[22] They later performed the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on March 22, 2011,[23] and on Dancing with the Stars on April 5, 2011.[24] The band also performed the song on an episode of So Random!.[25] The band also performed the song on Good Morning America on June 17, 2011.[26] On June 19, 2011, the band performed the song on the 2011 MuchMusic Video Awards,[27] whereas they performed it on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and Live with Regis and Kelly on June 24, 2011 and June 29, 2011, respectively.[28][29] On November 22, 2011, Gomez performed the song herself with Taylor Swift for her Speak Now World Tour in Madison Square Garden, New York.\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\\r\\n Since May 9, 2013, RIAA certifications for digital singles include on-demand audio and/or video song streams in addition to downloads.[42]","input":"When was who says by selena gomez written?"},{"output":"indicates a junior record (if a junior does not reach their 20th birthday in the calendar year of the mark)","context":"The sports under the umbrella of athletics, particularly track and field, use a large number of statistics.  In order to report that information efficiently, numerous abbreviations have grown to be common in the sport.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in 1948 by Bert Nelson and Cordner Nelson, Track and Field News became the leader in creating and defining abbreviations in this field.  But these abbreviations have also been adopted by, among others, the IAAF; the world governing body, various domestic governing bodies, the Association of Track and Field Statisticians, the Association of Road Racing Statisticians, the Associated Press and the individual media outlets who receive their reports.  These abbreviations also appear in Wikipedia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost all races record a time.  Evolving since experiments in the 1930s, to their official use at the 1968 Summer Olympics and official acceptance in 1977, fully automatic times have become common.  As this evolution has occurred, the rare early times were specified as FAT times.  As they are now commonplace, automatic times are now expressed using the hundredths of a second.  Hand times (watches operated by human beings) are not regarded as accurate and thus are only accepted to the accuracy of a tenth of a second even when the watch displays greater accuracy.  If the mark was set before 1977, a converted time to the tenth was recorded for record purposes, because they did not have a system to compare between the timing methods.  Frequently in those cases there is a mark to the 100th retained for that race.  Over this period of evolution, some reports show hand times also followed with an \\"h\\" or \\"ht\\" to distinguish hand times.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith two different timing methods came the inevitable desire to compare times.  Track and Field News initiated adding .24 to hand times as a conversion factor.  Many electronic hand stopwatches display times to the hundredth.  Frequently those readings are recorded, but are not accepted as valid (leading to confused results).  Some low level meets have even hand timed runners and have switched places according to the time displayed on the stopwatch.  All of this is, of course, wrong.  Hand times are not accurate enough to be accepted for record purposes for short races.  Human reaction time is not perfectly identical between different human beings.  Hand times involve human beings reacting, pushing the stopwatch button when they see the smoke or hear the sound of the Starting pistol, then reacting (possibly anticipating) the runner crossing the finish line.  The proper procedure for converting hand times would be to round any hundredths up to the next higher even tenth of a second and then add the .24 to get a time for comparison purposes only.[1]  But many meets displayed the converted marks accurate to the hundredth making the results look like they were taken with fully automatic timing.  In these cases, some meets have displayed a 4 or a 0 in the hundredths column for all races.  When detected, reports of these times are followed by a \\"c\\" or ' to indicate converted times.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoad race times are only considered accurate to a full second.  To distinguish a full second time with hours, from a minute time with hundredths of a second, colons are used to separate hours from minutes, and minutes from seconds.  A period is used to separate seconds from hundredths of a second.\\r\\n\\r\\nTransponder timing is becoming more common.  The RFID detection system times the transponder chip, usually located on a runner's shoe as opposed to the official timing of the torso.  Accurate to a full second, this is not significant, but in breaking microscopic ties, the data does not correspond to timing rules.  Most road races cannot fit all participants onto the start line.  Depending on the size of the field, some athletes could be several city blocks away from the start line and in the large crowd, could take minutes to get across the line.  Results frequently indicate two times, the \\"gun time\\" would be the official time from the firing of the starting gun, but the mat time shows the time the shoe crossed a sensing mat at the start line to the time the shoe crossed the sensing mat at the finish line.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccasionally, when breaking ties using photo finish, times are displayed to the thousandth of a second.  These times to the thousandth are not used for record purposes but times to the thousandth can be used to break ties between adjacent heats.  Rules specify if a tie is broken this way, that all heats involved are recorded with the same timing system.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost records are subject to ratification by the governing body for that record.  On the world level, that is the IAAF.  Each body has their own procedure for ratifying the records: for example, USATF, the governing body for the United States, only ratifies records once a year at their annual meeting at the beginning of December.\\r\\nUntil a record is ratified, it is regarded as \\"Pending\\" which is sometimes indicated by a following P\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a J is added, it indicates a junior record (if a junior does not reach their 20th birthday in the calendar year of the mark)\\r\\n\\r\\nSome records are ratified or tracked, but they are not to the same standard of quality or accuracy as a record.

A youth athlete has not reached or will not reach their 18th birthday in the calendar year of competition.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor events where wind assistance is a factor (outdoor races 220 yards or less, Long Jump and Triple Jump),  the wind reading is usually reported in metres per second or \\"m/s\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAthlete disqualifications often reference the IAAF rule number under which the athlete was disqualified.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is typically written in the format (false start as example): DQ R162.7[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe various organizing bodies of the sport are abbreviated into alphabet soup.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the large number of athletics events that are regularly contested, presentations of results and statistics often use abbreviations to refer to the events, rather than the full form.","input":"What does j mean in track and field?"},{"output":"Alexander Calder","context":"Alexander Calder (/?k??ld?r/) is widely considered to be one of the most important American sculptors of the 20th century. He is best known for his colorful, whimsical abstract public sculptures and his innovative mobiles, kinetic sculptures powered by motors or air currents, which embraced chance in their aesthetic. Born into a family of accomplished artists, Calder's work first gained attention in Paris in the 1930s and was soon championed by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, resulting in a retrospective exhibition in 1943. Major retrospectives were also held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (1964) and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1974). Calders work is in many permanent collections, most notably in the Whitney Museum of American Art, but also the Guggenheim Museum; the Museum of Modern Art; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; and the Centre Georges Pompidou. He produced many large public works, including .125 (at JFK Airport, 1957), Pittsburgh (Carnegie International prize winner 1958, Pittsburgh International Airport) Spirale (UNESCO in Paris, 1958), Flamingo and Universe (both in Chicago, 1974), and Mountains and Clouds (Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C., 1976). Although primarily known for his sculpture, Calder was a prodigious artist with a restless creative spirit, whose diverse practice included painting and printmaking, miniatures (such as his famous Cirque Calder), childrens book illustrations, theater set design, jewelry design, tapestries and rugs, and political posters.[2] Calder was honored by the US Postal Service with a set of five 32-cent stamps in 1998, and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, posthumously in 1977, after refusing to receive it from Gerald Ford one year earlier in protest of the Vietnam War.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlexander \\"Sandy\\" Calder was born in 1898 in Lawnton, Pennsylvania.[3] His actual birthday, however, remains a source of much confusion. According to Calder's mother, Nanette (ne Lederer), Calder was born on August 22, yet his birth certificate at Philadelphia City Hall, based on a hand-written ledger, stated July 22. When Calder's family learned about the birth certificate, they reasserted with certainty that city officials had made a mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalder's grandfather, sculptor Alexander Milne Calder, was born in Scotland, had immigrated to Philadelphia in 1868, and is best known for the colossal statue of William Penn on top of Philadelphia City Hall's tower. His father, Alexander Stirling Calder, was a well-known sculptor who created many public installations, a majority of them in nearby Philadelphia. Calder's mother was a professional portrait artist, who had studied at the Acadmie Julian and the Sorbonne in Paris from around 1888 until 1893. She moved to Philadelphia, where she met Stirling Calder while studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Calder's parents married on February 22, 1895; his sister, Mrs. Margaret Calder Hayes, was instrumental in the development of the UC Berkeley Art Museum.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1902, Calder posed nude for his fathers sculpture The Man Cub, a cast of which is now located in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. That same year he also completed his earliest sculpture, a clay elephant.[5] Three years later, Stirling Calder contracted tuberculosis, and Calder's parents moved to a ranch in Oracle, Arizona, leaving the children in the care of family friends for a year.[6] The children were reunited with their parents in late March 1906 and stayed at the ranch in Arizona until fall of the same year.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Arizona, the Calder family moved to Pasadena, California. The windowed cellar of the family home became Calder's first studio and he received his first set of tools. He used scraps of copper wire that he found in the street to make jewelry for his sister's dolls. On January 1, 1907, Nanette Calder took her son to the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, where he observed a four-horse-chariot race. This style of event later became the finale of Calder's miniature circus performances.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fall of 1909, the Calder family moved back to Philadelphia, where Calder briefly attended Germantown Academy, then moved to Croton-on-Hudson, New York.[9] That Christmas, he sculpted a dog and a duck out of sheet brass as gifts for his parents. The sculptures are three-dimensional and the duck is kinetic because it rocks when gently tapped.[10] In Croton, during his early high school years, Calder was befriended by his father's painter friend Everett Shinn with whom he built a gravity powered system of mechanical trains. Calder described it, \\"We ran the train on wooden rails held by spikes; a chunk of iron racing down the incline speeded  [sic] the cars. We even lit up some cars with candle lights\\".[11] After Croton, the Calders moved to Spuyten Duyvil to be closer to New York City, where Stirling Calder  rented  a studio. While living in Spuyten Duyvil, Calder attended high school in nearby Yonkers. In 1912, Stirling Calder was appointed acting chief of the Department of Sculpture of the PanamaÿPacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California,[12] and began work on sculptures for the exposition that was held in 1915.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Calder's high school years (1912ÿ1915), the family moved back and forth between New York and California. In each new location, Calder's parents reserved cellar space as a studio for their son. Toward the end of this period, Calder stayed with friends in California while his parents moved back to New York, so that he could graduate from Lowell High School in San Francisco. Calder graduated with the class of 1915.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlexander Calder's parents did not want him to suffer the life of an artist, so he decided to study mechanical engineering. An intuitive engineer since childhood, Calder did not even know what mechanical engineering was. \\"I was not very sure what this term meant, but I thought I'd better adopt it,\\" he later wrote in his autobiography. He enrolled at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1915.[13] When asked why he decided to study mechanical engineering instead of art Calder said, \\"I wanted to be an engineer because some guy I rather liked was a mechanical engineer, that's all.\\" [14] At Stevens, Calder was a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity and excelled in mathematics.[15] He was well-liked and the class yearbook contained the following description, \\"Sandy is evidently always happy, or perhaps up to some joke, for his face is always wrapped up in that same mischievous, juvenile grin. This is certainly the index to the man's character in this case, for he is one of the best natured fellows there is.\\" [14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer of 1916, Calder spent five weeks training at the Plattsburg Civilian Military Training Camp. In 1918, he joined the Students Army Training Corps, Naval Section, at Stevens and was made guide of the battalion.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nCalder received a degree from Stevens in 1919.[13] For the next several years, he held a variety of jobs, including working as a hydraulic engineer and a draughtsman for the New York Edison Company. In June 1922, Calder found work as a mechanic on the passenger ship H. F. Alexander. While the ship sailed from San Francisco to New York City, Calder slept on deck and awoke one early morning off the Guatemalan Coast and witnessed both the sun rising and the full moon setting on opposite horizons. He described in his autobiography, \\"It was early one morning on a calm sea, off Guatemala, when over my coucha coil of ropeI saw the beginning of a fiery red sunrise on one side and the moon looking like a silver coin on the other.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe H.F. Alexander docked in San Francisco and Calder traveled up to Aberdeen, Washington, where his sister lived with her husband, Kenneth Hayes. Calder took a job as a timekeeper at a logging camp. The mountain scenery inspired him to write home to request paints and brushes. Shortly after this, Calder decided to move back to New York to pursue a career as an artist.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalder moved to New York and enrolled at the Art Students League, studying briefly with Thomas Hart Benton, George Luks, Kenneth Hayes Miller, and John Sloan.[18] While a student, he worked for the National Police Gazette where, in 1925, one of his assignments was sketching the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Calder became fascinated with the action of the circus, a theme that would reappear in his later work.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1926, Calder moved to Paris, enrolled in the Acadmie de la Grande Chaumire, and established a studio at 22 rue Daguerre in the Montparnasse Quarter. In June 1929, while traveling by boat from Paris to New York, Calder met his future wife, Louisa James (1905-1996), grandniece of author Henry James and philosopher William James. They married in 1931. While in Paris, Calder met and became friends with a number of avant-garde artists, including Fernand Lger, Jean Arp, and Marcel Duchamp. Leger wrote a preface for the catalogue of Calders first exhibition of abstract constructions held at the Galerie Percier in 1931.[2] Calder and Louisa returned to America in 1933 to settle in a farmhouse they purchased in Roxbury, Connecticut, where they raised a family (first daughter, Sandra born 1935, second daughter, Mary, in 1939). During World War II, Calder attempted to join the Marines as a camofleur, but was rejected. In 1955 Alexander and Louisa Calder traveled around in India for three months, where Calder produced nine sculptures as well as some jewelry.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1963, Calder settled into his new workshop, which overlooked the valley of the Lower Chevrire to Sach in Indre-et-Loire (France). He donated to the town a sculpture, which since 1974 has been situated in the town square. Throughout his artistic career, Calder named many of his works in French, regardless of where they were destined for eventual display.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1966, Calder published his Autobiography with Pictures with the help of his son-in-law, Jean Davidson.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalder died unexpectedly on November 11, 1976 of a heart attack,[20] shortly after the opening of a major retrospective show at the Whitney Museum in New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1926, at the suggestion of a Serbian toy merchant in Paris, Calder began to make mechanical toys. At the urging of fellow sculptor Jose de Creeft, he submitted them to the Salon des Humoristes. Calder began to create his Cirque Calder, a miniature circus fashioned from wire, cloth, string, rubber, cork, and other found objects. Designed to be transportable (it eventually grew to fill five large suitcases), the circus was presented on both sides of the Atlantic. Soon, his Cirque Calder[21] (on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art at present) became popular with the Parisian avant-garde. He also invented wire sculpture, or \\"drawing in space,\\" and in 1929 he had his first solo show of these sculptures in Paris at Galerie Billiet.  Hi! (Two Acrobats) in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art is an early example of the artist's wire sculpture.  The painter Jules Pascin, a friend of Calder's from the cafes of Montparnasse, wrote the preface to the catalog. A visit to Piet Mondrian's studio in 1930, where he was impressed by the environment-as-installation, \\"shocked\\" him into fully embracing abstract art, toward which he had already been tending.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the mixture of his experiments to develop purely abstract sculpture following his visit with Mondrian that led to his first truly kinetic sculptures, manipulated by means of cranks and motors, that would become his signature artworks. Calders kinetic sculptures are regarded as being amongst the earliest manifestations of an art that consciously departed from the traditional notion of the art work as a static object and integrated the ideas of gesture and immateriality as aesthetic factors.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nDating from 1931, Calders sculptures of discrete movable parts powered by motors were christened mobiles by Marcel Duchamp, a French pun meaning both \\"motion\\" and \\"motive.\\"[24] However, Calder found that the motorized works sometimes became monotonous in their prescribed movements. His solution, arrived at by 1932, was hanging sculptures that derived their motion from touch or air currents. They were followed in 1934 by outdoor pieces which were set in motion by the open air.[25] The wind mobiles featured abstract shapes delicately balanced on pivoting rods that moved with the slightest current of air, allowing for a freer, more natural, shifting play of forms and spatial relationships.[26] At the same time, Calder was also experimenting with self-supporting, static, abstract sculptures, dubbed \\"stabiles\\" by Jean Arp in 1932 to differentiate them from mobiles. In 1935ÿ1936, he produced a number of works made largely of carved wood. At Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937), the Spanish pavilion included Calder's sculpture Mercury Fountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Calders sculptures are not explicitly representational, many of his themes, symbols and shapes are related to the cosmos or suggestive of nature.[2] During World War II, Calder continued to sculpt, adapting to a scarcity of aluminum during the war by returning to carved wood in a new open form of sculpture called \\"constellations.\\"[27] Once the war was over, Calder began to cut shapes from sheet metal into evocative forms and would hand-paint them in his characteristically pure hues of black, red, blue, and white.[28] Calder created a small group of works from around this period with a hanging base-plate, for example Lily of Force (1945), Baby Flat Top (1946), and Red is Dominant (1947). Calder also set about creating new works such as Seven Horizontal Discs (1946), which, like Lily of Force (1945) and Baby Flat Top (1946), he was able to dismantle and send by mail despite the stringent size restrictions imposed by the postal service at the time.[29] His 1946 show at the Galerie Louis Carr in Paris, composed mainly of hanging and standing mobiles, made a huge impact, as did the essay for the catalogue written, at the artist's invitation, by French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre.[30] In 1951, Calder devised a new kind of sculpture, related structurally to his constellations. These \\"towers,\\" affixed to the wall with a nail, consist of wire struts and beams that jut out from the wall, with moving objects suspended from their armatures.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile not denying Calder's power as a sculptor, an alternate view of the history of twentieth-century art[32] cites Calder's turning away in the early 1930s from his motor-powered works in favor of the wind-driven mobile as marking a decisive moment in Modernism's abandonment of its earlier commitment to the machine as a critical and potentially expressive new element in human affairs ÿ and an abandonment, in effect, of its larger goal of a rapprochement with science and engineering ÿ and this with unfortunate, if not to say disastrous, long-term implications for contemporary art:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe larger myth of the mobile is that it represents the triumph of kinetic sculpture, when in reality the mobile was as different as one could imagine from the original vision: passive rather than active; not at all mechanical; and random rather than directed in its motion. Indeed, the mobile drew upon none of the incredible technical resources of the twentieth century, the appropriation of which had of course been the principal inspiration of the original kineticists.\\r\\nIn the 1950s, Calder increasingly concentrated his efforts on producing monumental sculptures (his self-described period of \\"agrandissements\\"), particularly  as public commissions increasingly came his way in the 1960s.[33] Notable examples are .125 for JFK Airport in 1957, Spirale for UNESCO in Paris 1958 and Trois disques, commissioned for Expo 67 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Calder's largest sculpture at 25.7?meters high was El Sol Rojo, constructed outside the Aztec Stadium for the 1968 Summer Olympics \\"Cultural Olympiad\\" events in Mexico City. Many of his public works were commissioned by renowned architects; I.M. Pei commissioned his La Grande Voile (1966), a 25-ton, 40-foot high stabile for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1934, Calder made his first outdoor works in his Roxbury, Connecticut studio, using the same techniques and materials as his smaller works. Exhibited outside, Calder's initial standing mobiles moved elegantly in the breeze, bobbing and swirling in natural, spontaneous rhythms. In fact, the first few outdoor works were too delicate for strong winds, which forced Calder to rethink his fabrication process.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1936, he responded to the problem, changing his working methods. He began to create smaller scale maquettes that he then enlarged to monumental size. The small metal maquette, the first step in the production of a monumental sculpture, was already for Calder a sculpture in its own right. The larger works were made under his direction, using the classic enlargement techniques used in different ways by traditional sculptors, including his father and grandfather. Calder began to draw his designs on brown craft paper, which he enlarged using a grid. His large-scale works were created according to his exact specifications, while also allowing him the liberty to adjust or correct a shape or line if necessary.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made most of his monumental stabiles and mobiles after 1962 at Etablissements Bimont in Tours, France. Calder would create a model of his work, the engineering department would scale it up to final size under Calder's direction, and then technicians would complete the actual metalwork  all under Calder's watchful eye.  Stabiles were made in steel plate, then painted in black or in colors. An exception was Trois disques, in stainless steel at 24?meters tall, which was commissioned by International Nickel Company of Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1958, Calder asked Jean Prouv to construct the steel base of Spirale in France, a monumental mobile for the UNESCO site in Paris, while the top was fabricated in Connecticut. In June 1969, Calder attended the dedication of his monumental stabile La Grande Vitesse in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This sculpture is notable for being the first civic sculpture in the United States to receive funding from the National Endowment for the Arts.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nCalder created a sculpture called Bent Propeller, which in 1971 was installed at the entrance of the World Trade Center's North Tower in New York City. When Battery Park City opened, the sculpture was moved to Vesey and Church Streets.[36] The sculpture stood in front of 7 World Trade Center until it was destroyed on September 11, 2001.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1974 Calder unveiled to the public two sculptures, Flamingo at Federal Plaza and Universe at Sears Tower,[38] in Chicago, Illinois. The exhibition Alexander Calder: A Retrospective Exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, opened simultaneously with the unveiling of the sculptures.[39] Originally meant to be constructed in 1977 for the Hart Senate Office Building, Mountains and Clouds was not built until 1985 due to government budget cuts. The massive project, constructed of sheet steel and weighing 35 tons, spans the entire nine-story height of the building's atrium in Washington, D.C. Calder designed the maquette in the last year of his life for the US Senate.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of Calder's repertoire includes pivotal stage sets for more than a dozen theatrical productions, including Nucla, Horizon, and most notably, Martha Grahams Panorama (1935), a production of the Erik Satie symphonic drama Socrate (1936), and later, Works in Progress (1968). The production of the Socrate set was a decisive moment in Calder's artistic development that he described as \\"an indication of a good deal of my subsequent work.\\"[41] Works in Progress was a ballet conceived by Calder himself and produced at the Rome Opera House, featuring an array of mobiles, stabiles, and large painted backdrops.[42] Calder would describe some of his stage sets as dancers performing a choreography due to their rhythmic movement.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to sculptures, Calder painted throughout his career, beginning in the early 1920s. He picked up his study of printmaking in 1925, and continued to produce illustrations for books and journals.[43] His many projects from this period include pen-and-ink line drawings of animals for a 1931 publication of Aesops fables. As Calders sculpture moved into the realm of pure abstraction in the early 1930s, so did his prints. The thin lines used to define figures in the earlier prints and drawings began delineating groups of geometric shapes, often in motion. Calder also used prints for advocacy, as in poster prints from 1967 and 1969 protesting the Vietnam War.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Calders professional reputation expanded in the late 1940s and 1950s, so did his production of prints. Masses of lithographs based on his gouache paintings hit the market, and deluxe editions of plays, poems, and short stories illustrated with fine art prints by Calder became available for sale.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of Calder's most celebrated and unconventional undertakings was a commission from Dallas-based Braniff International Airways to paint a full-size Douglas DC-8-62 four-engined jet as a \\"flying canvas.\\" George Stanley Gordon, founder of the New York City advertising agency Gordon and Shortt, first approached Calder with the idea of painting a jet in 1972, but Calder responded that he did not paint toys. When Gordon told him it was a real, full-sized airliner he was proposing that Calder paint, the artist  immediately gave his approval. Gordon felt that Braniff, known for melding the worlds of fashion and design with the world of aviation, would be the perfect company to carry out the idea. Braniff Chairman Harding Lawrence was highly receptive and a contract was drawn up in 1973 calling for the painting of one Douglas DC-8-62 jet liner, dubbed Flying Colors, and 50 gouaches for a total price of $100,000.[45] Two years later, Braniff asked Calder to design a flagship for their fleet celebrating the U.S. Bicentennial. That piece, a 727-200 jet called the Flying Colors of the United States, featured a rippled image of red, white and blue echoing a waving American flag.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1975, Calder was commissioned to paint a BMW 3.0 CSL, which would be the first vehicle in the BMW Art Car Project.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nCalder created over 2,000 pieces of jewelry over the course of his career, many of them as gifts for friends and relatives. Several pieces reflect Calder's fascination with art from Africa and other continents.[47] They were mostly made of brass and steel, with bits of ceramic, wood and glass. Calder rarely used solder; when he needed to join strips of metal, he linked them with loops, bound them with snippets of wire or fashioned rivets.[48] Calder created his first pieces in 1906 at the age of eight for his sister's dolls using copper wire that he found in the street.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor his lifelong friend Joan Mir܇, he set a shard of a broken porcelain vessel in a brass ring. Peggy Guggenheim received enormous silver mobile earrings and later commissioned a hammered silver headboard that shimmered with dangling fish.[49] In 1942, Guggenheim wore one Calder earring and one by Yves Tanguy to the opening of her New York gallery, The Art of This Century, to demonstrate her equal loyalty to Surrealist and abstract art, examples of which she displayed in separate galleries.[50] Others who were presented with Calder's pieces were the artist's close friend, Georgia O'Keeffe; Teeny Duchamp, wife of Marcel Duchamp; Jeanne Rucar, wife of the filmmaker Luis Bu?uel; and Bella Rosenfeld, wife of Marc Chagall.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nCalder's first solo exhibition came in 1927, at the Gallery of Jacques Seligmann in Paris.[52] In 1928, his first solo show in a US commercial gallery was at the Weyhe Gallery in New York City. In 1933, he exhibited with the Abstraction-Cration group in Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1935, he had his first solo museum exhibition in the United States at The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago. In New York, he was championed from the early 1930s by the Museum of Modern Art, and was one of three Americans to be included in Alfred H. Barr Jr.'s 1936 exhibition Cubism and Abstract Art.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nCalder's first retrospective was held in 1938 at George Walter Vincent Smith Gallery in Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1943, the Museum of Modern Art hosted a well-received Calder retrospective, curated by James Johnson Sweeney and Marcel Duchamp; the show had to be extended due to the sheer number of visitors.[54] Calder was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the summer of 1949. His mobile, International Mobile was the centerpiece of the exhibition. Calder also participated in documentas I (1955), II (1959), III (1964). Major retrospectives of his work were held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (1964), the Fondation Maeght in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France (1969), and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1974). In addition, both of Calder's dealers, Galerie Maeght in Paris and the Perls Galleries in New York, averaged about one Calder show each per year.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalder's work is in many permanent collections across the world. The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, has the largest body of work by Alexander Calder.[55] Other important museum collections include the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofa, Madrid; and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Philadelphia Museum of Art offers a view of works by three generations of Alexander Calders. From the second floor window on the east side of the Great Stair Hall (on the opposite side from the armor collection) there is behind the viewer the Ghost mobile from the 3rd generation (born 1898),[57] ahead on the street is the Swann Memorial Fountain by the 2nd generation (born 1870), and beyond that the statue of William Penn atop City Hall from the 1st generation (born 1846).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1930s and early 1940s, even as Calders international acclaim was growing, his works were still not highly sought after, and when they sold, it was often for relatively little money. A copy of a Pierre Matisse sales ledger in the foundations files shows that only a few pieces in the 1941 show found buyers, one of whom, Solomon R. Guggenheim, paid only $233.34 (about $3,500 in 2014 dollars) for a work. The Museum of Modern Art had bought its first Calder in 1934 for $60, after talking Calder down from $100.[27] In 2010, his metal mobile Untitled (Autumn Leaves), sold at Sotheby's New York for $3.7 million. Another mobile brought $6.35 million at Christie's later that year.[60] Also at Christie's, a standing mobile called Lily of Force (1945), which was expected to sell for $8 to $12 million, was bought for $18.5 million in 2012.[61] Calders 7 1/2-foot-long hanging mobile Poisson volant (Flying Fish) (1957) fetched $25.9 million, setting an auction record for the sculptor at Christie's New York in 2014.[62][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nGalerie Maeght in Paris became Calder's exclusive Parisian dealer in 1950 and for the rest of Calder's life. After his New York dealer Curt Valentin died unexpectedly in 1954, Calder selected the Perls Galleries in New York as his new American dealer, and this alliance also lasted until the end of his life.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1966 through the present, winners of the National Magazine Awards are awarded an \\"Ellie\\", a copper-colored stabile resembling an elephant, which was designed by Calder. Two months after his death, the artist was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States' highest civilian honor, by President Gerald Ford. However, representatives of the Calder family boycotted the January 10, 1977 ceremony \\"to make a statement favoring amnesty for Vietnam War draft resisters\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1987, the Calder Foundation was established by Calder's family. The foundation \\"is dedicated to collecting, exhibiting, preserving, and interpreting the art and archives of Alexander Calder and is charged with an unmatched collection of his works.\\"[65] The foundation has large holdings, with some works owned by family members and others by foundation supporters. The art includes more than 600 sculptures (including mobiles, stabiles, standing mobiles, and wire sculptures), and 22 monumental outdoor works, as well as thousands of oil paintings, works on paper, toys, pieces of jewelry, and domestic objects.[66] The US copyright representative for the Calder Foundation is the Artists Rights Society.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having worked mainly on cataloging Calders works, the Calder Foundation is now focusing on organizing global exhibitions for the artist.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Calder Foundation does not authenticate artworks; rather, owners can submit their works for registration in the Foundation's archive and for examination.[69] The committee that performs examinations includes experts, scholars, museum curators, and members of the Calder family.[70]  The Calder Foundation's website provides details on the current policies and guidelines governing examination procedures.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1993, the owners of Rio Nero (1959), a sheet-metal and steel-wire mobile ostensibly by Calder, went to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia charging that it was not by Alexander Calder, which the dealer who had sold it to them had claimed.[72] That same year, a federal judge ruled that for Rio Nero the burden of proof had not been fulfilled.[further explanation needed] Despite the decision, the owners of the mobile could not sell it because the recognized expert, Klaus Perls, had declared it a copy. The judge recognized the problem at the time, noting that Perls pronouncement would make Rio Nero unsellable. In 1994, the Calder Foundation declined to include the mobile in the catalogue raisonn on the artist.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nReferring to the Rio Nero case, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court in 2009 rejected the appeal of an art collector who wished to sell a couple of stage sets that Calder had designed but did not live to see completed, which had been unsuccessfully submitted to the Calder Foundation for authentication.[74] The court found that it did not have the power to declare the purported Calder work authentic, nor to order the Calder Foundation to include it in the catalogue raisonn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, questions arose about another purported Calder, Two White Dots (this piece is distinguished from a similarly-named piece, Two White Dots in the Air, created by Calder in 1958). Calder created a 1-foot (0.30?m) high sheet metal maquette in 1973 for an unrealized stabile he called Two White Dots. He gave this maquette to Carmen Segretario, founder and owner of the Segr Foundry of Waterbury, Connecticut. For decades, Calder had utilized the services of Segr Foundry in manufacturing his mobiles and stabiles. Each piece (no matter how many copies were made) would be initialled personally by Calder in white chalk, after which a welder would follow the chalk marks to burn the initials into the work. Calder died in 1976, without a full-size version of Two White Dots ever having been made. In 1982, Segretario constructed a full-size version of Two White Dots, and sold it in 1983 to art dealer Shirley Teplitz for $70,000. Segetario's documentation claimed that the work had been fabricated around 1974 \\"under the supervision and direction of Artist\\".[75] Two White Dots was then sold at auction in May 1984 for $187,000.[76] Over the next decade, the piece was sold repeatedly. In 1995, Jon Shirley (the former president of Microsoft and a Calder collector) purchased Two White Dots for $1 million. When Shirley submitted the work to the Calder Foundation for inclusion in their catalogue raisonn, the Foundation contested the work's authenticity. The Andr Emmerich Gallery refunded Shirley's money, and sued the Segr Foundry, which sought bankruptcy protection. The suit was settled out of court in the late 1990s. Two White Dots now resides outdoors on a farm near a river outside the small town of Washington, Connecticut.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter similar ideas were developed for New York in 1998,[66] plans for a museum devoted to Calder in Philadelphia were announced in 2000. The proposed 35,000-square-foot Calder museum, designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando, was to be located on a two-acre lot. The facility, which was slated for a 2008 opening, would have cost an estimated $70 million.[77] The late sculptor's heirs had agreed to an unprecedented gift to the museum but in 2005, the plans were abandoned over failed fundraising efforts.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"How can art be realized?\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of volumes, motion, spaces bounded by the great space, the universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of different masses, tight, heavy, middlingindicated by variations of size or colordirectional linevectors which represent speeds, velocities, accelerations, forces, etc. . . .these directions making between them meaningful angles, and senses, together defining one big conclusion or many.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpaces, volumes, suggested by the smallest means in contrast to their mass, or even including them, juxtaposed, pierced by vectors, crossed by speeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing at all of this is fixed.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach element able to move, to stir, to oscillate, to come and go in its relationships with the other elements in its universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt must not be just a fleeting moment but a physical bond between the varying events in life.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot extractions,\\r\\n\\r\\nBut abstractions\\r\\n\\r\\nAbstractions that are like nothing in life except in their manner of reacting.\\"[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nL'empennage (The Empennage) (1953), Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art\\r\\n\\r\\nAcoustic Ceiling (1953),Aula Magna, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Caracas, Venezuela\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Four Elements (1961), Moderna Museet, installation in front of the museum entrance\\r\\n\\r\\nLe tamanoir (The Anteater) (1963),Rotterdam, Netherlands\\r\\n\\r\\nTtes et queue (Heads and tail) (1965),Berlin, Germany\\r\\n\\r\\nDe tre vingarna (The Three Wings) (1967), Bl?

It has also been introduced to Hawaii, the Bahamas, Cuba, Croatia, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, the Lesser Antilles, Belize, Honduras, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia, Suriname, Venezuela, Guyana and Mafia Island.[2] The western subspecies group is sometimes treated as a separate species, the Indian mongoose or small Indian mongoose (Herpestes palustris).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis species of mongoose is sympatric with Herpestes edwardsii in much of its native range and can be readily distinguished from the latter species by its much smaller size.\\r\\nThe body is slender and the head is elongated with a pointed snout. The lengths of the head and body is 509-671mm. The ears are short. They have five toed feet with long claws. Genders differ in size with males having a wider head and bigger bodies.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey use about 12 different vocalizations.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis species occurs naturally throughout most of southern mainland Asia, from Iraq to China, as well as on the island of Java, at altitudes up to 2200 m.  It has also been introduced to dozens of islands in the Pacific and Caribbean (including Saint Lucia, Jamaica and Puerto Rico), as well as a few in the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean, as well as to mainland Venezuela.  It is capable of living among fairly dense human populations.\\r\\n\\r\\nMongooses live in scrublands and dry forest. On Pacific Islands they live in rainforests as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese mongoose mostly eat insects but are opportunistic feeders and will eat crabs, frogs, spiders, scorpions, snakes, small mammals, birds and eggs.\\r\\n\\r\\nMongooses are mostly solitary although males will sometimes form social groups and share burrows. Pregnancy duration is up to 49 days. A litter can consist of 2ÿ5 young.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1800s was a huge century for sugar cane, and plantations shot up on many tropical islands including Hawaii, Fiji and Jamaica. With sugar cane came rats, attracted to the sweet plant, which ended up causing crop destruction and loss. Attempts were made to introduce the species in Trinidad in 1870 but this failed.[5] A subsequent trial with four males and five females from Calcutta however established in Jamaica in 1872. A paper published by W. B. Espeut that praised the results intrigued Hawaiian plantation owners who, in 1883, brought 72 mongooses from Jamaica to the Hamakua Coast on the Big Island. These were raised and their offspring were shipped to plantations on other islands.[6] Populations that have been introduced to these islands show larger range sizes than in their native ranges.[7] They also show genetic diversification due to drift and population isolation.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly the islands of Lana'i and Kaua'i are thought to be free of mongooses. There are two conflicting stories of why Kaua'i was spared. The first is that the residents of Kaua'i were opposed to having the animals on the island and when the ship carrying the offspring reached Kaua'i, the animals were thrown overboard and drowned. A second story tells that on arriving on Kaua'i one of the mongooses bit a dockworker who, in a fit of anger, threw the caged animals into the harbor to drown.\\r\\n[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in 1870, the small Asian mongoose was introduced to Jamaica, Cuba, Hispaniola, St. Croix (1884), also to prey upon black rats (Rattus rattus) that were ravaging the sugarcane industry. While very successful in reducing sugarcane damage from rats, the introduction had a negative impact on reptiles and other animals. For instance, the solenodons were almost made extinct. green iguana (Iguana iguana) has been greatly reduced in number and the St. Croix ground lizard (Ameiva polops) was eliminated from the island of St. Croix (but not from Protestant Cay, Green Cay, Ruth Cay, and Buck Island) before 1962. Ground nesting birds have also been greatly affected. Mongooses have even preyed upon fawns of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Because of the negative effect on other animals, the United States and other countries in the Americas banned importing live mongoose.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mongoose was introduced onto Okinawa Island in 1910 and Amami shima Island in 1979 in an attempt to control the population of Habu (Trimeresurus flavoviridis, Ʊ) and other pests; an invasive species, they have since become pests themselves.[12][13]\\r\\nThe efficacy of the mongoose against the habu population was quite limited however since the mongoose is a diurnal creature and the habu is nocturnal.  As such they didn't encounter each other as often as had been desired.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost reports claim that the mongoose introduction did not have the desired effect of rat control, either in Hawaii or St. Croix. (This may be because rats are nocturnal and mongooses aren't.) The mongoose hunted birds and bird eggs, threatening many local island species. The mongooses bred prolifically with males becoming sexually mature at 4 months and females producing litters of 2ÿ5 pups a year. On Okinawa, the mongoose is known to carry antimicrobial-resistant strains of E. coli.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nMongooses can carry leptospirosis,[16] and are a major rabies vector in Puerto Rico.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, the European Commission put the mongoose on the list of invasive alien species in the EU.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nTseng, Zhijie; Flynn, John (January 2015). \\"Convergence analysis of a finite element skull model of Herpestes javanicus (Carnivora, Mammalia): Implications for robust comparative inferences of biomechanical function\\".

The Eagles have won six FCS (I-AA) national championships and have produced two Walter Payton Award winners. The Eagles first continuously fielded a football team in 1924; however, play was suspended for World War II and revived in 1981. The Eagles competed as an FCS independent from 1984 until 1992 as the Eagles' main conference at the time, the Trans America Athletic Conference (now known as the Atlantic Sun Conference), did not sponsor football, and as a member of the Southern Conference from 1993 until 2013, winning 10 SoCon championships.

Football was suspended in 1941 at the outset of World War II and would not return for 41 years.\\r\\nIn 1978, President Dale Lick decided that football should be revived at Georgia Southern College. Despite a faculty senate vote against renewing the sport, Lick worked to generate support for the endeavor. In 1982, the school hired Erk Russell, the popular and charismatic defensive coordinator at the University of Georgia, to coach the new football team. On the hire, humorist Lewis Grizzard said, \\"When they landed Erk Russell, they got themselves a franchise.\\"[3] The Eagles fielded a club team in 1982 and 1983 and began official NCAA Division I-AA play in 1984. The next year, the Eagles would win their first Division I-AA national championship in Tacoma, Washington, defeating Furman University, in only the team's fourth year in existence, second as a varsity team. The Eagles would return to Tacoma the next year and win the championship vs. Arkansas State. In 1989, the Eagles became the first college team to go 15ÿ0 in the 20th century, winning the national championship on their home field vs. Stephen F. Austin. Soon after the game, Russell retired.\\r\\nTim Stowers was hired to succeed Russell after Georgia Southern's 1989 (15ÿ0) national title. Stowers was the 1989 offensive coordinator, one of only two coordinators since 1900 to direct an offense of a team with a 15ÿ0 record. However, Stowers was never able to live up to the expectations set by Russell and was fired in 1995 after a 9ÿ4 record, ranked as one of top 8 teams in 1995 (lost at Montana the eventual I-AA/FCS National Champion and beat No. 1-ranked Troy State 11ÿ0 on the road), by new athletics director Sam Baker, who never saw Stowers coach a game. Stowers had an overall record of 51ÿ23 (.689) vs. FCS/I-AA opponents. FBS/D-IA losses-Miami Hurricanes twice, Georgia Bulldogs, Auburn Tigers, and Bobby Bowden and Florida State Seminoles. Stowers had a 6ÿ2 playoff record and a 51ÿ18 (.739) overall record vs. I-AA/FCS opponents and lower. Stowers won the 1990 I-AA national championship (12ÿ3) and was named AFCA Kodak National Coach of the Year. He also won Georgia Southern's first Southern Conference Title in 1993 (first year in the league) and was named 1993 Southern Conference Coach of the Year. He was succeeded by interim coach Frank Ellwood for one year. The 1996 season was the first losing season in the modern era as the Eagles fell to 4ÿ7.\\r\\nThe next coach for the Eagles was Paul Johnson. Johnson found instant success, taking the Eagles to the playoffs in his first season. He, along with Eagle legend Adrian N. Peterson, reached the 1998 national championship. However, the Eagles lost the game to the University of Massachusetts 55ÿ43 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The Eagles rebounded under Johnson and won back-to-back national championships in 1999 (vs. Youngstown State) and 2000 (vs. Montana). Both games were played in Chattanooga, Tenn. After the 2001 season, Johnson resigned to become the head coach of Navy.\\r\\nJohnson was succeeded by Mike Sewak. Despite winning the Southern Conference championship twice in his tenure, his lack of postseason success as well as a falling out with former head coach Erk Russell led to his firing after the 2005 season. Brian VanGorder, a former defensive coordinator at the University of Georgia, was hired to succeed Sewak. In the first of many controversial moves, VanGorder scrapped Georgia Southern's famed triple-option offense and did away with certain traditions, such as the team's arrival at home games on yellow school buses. Erk Russell had also died unexpectedly of a stroke on the eve the first game of the 2006 season after addressing the team on the night before. VanGorder led the team to a 3ÿ8 record, the worst record at the time in the modern era of Georgia Southern football. After his unsatisfactory one year as coach, VanGorder left to take a position with the Atlanta Falcons. Chris Hatcher, formerly the head coach at Valdosta State University, which he led to the 2004 NCAA Division II Football Championship, was named the new head coach on January 19, 2007. Hatcher led the Eagles back to a winning record with a 7ÿ4 finish, barely missing the playoffs. However, Hatcher could not replicate the success of his first season, going 11ÿ11 in the following two seasons. He was dismissed after the conclusion of the 2009 season, the team's third modern era season with a losing record at 5ÿ6, and the second within four years.\\r\\nOn November 29, 2009, school officials announced that Jeff Monken, a longtime assistant coach under Paul Johnson, would become the next head coach of the Eagles. Monken's hiring signaled the return of the triple-option offense which brought success to the program in years past. In Monken's first year, the Eagles finished the regular season with a 7ÿ4 record and made their first playoff appearance since 2005, advancing to the semifinals, where the Eagles fell to the Delaware Blue Hens.\\r\\nDuring the 2011 season, Georgia Southern was ranked No. 1 in the FCS for the first time since the 2001 season.[4] Additionally, Georgia Southern clinched the Southern Conference Football Championship for the first time since 2004 and first time outright since 2002.[5] The Eagles finished the 2011 regular season with a 9ÿ2 record; however, they were ousted in the semifinals for a second straight year by the eventual FCS champion North Dakota State Bison. In the 2012 season, the Eagles finished the regular season with an 8ÿ3 record with a share of the Southern Conference Championship; however, the Eagles fell for a third straight time in what was ultimately the team's final FCS playoff game in the FCS semifinals, losing a rematch of the previous year's semifinal game against North Dakota State. In the team's final FCS season, the Eagles compiled a 7ÿ4 record. In the final game of that season, the Eagles earned an upset win over the Florida Gators 26ÿ20, the team's first win over an FBS opponent in 21 tries. On December 24, 2013, Monken resigned to become the next head coach of the Army Black Knights.[6][7]\\r\\nAfter years of rumors and fan speculation, Georgia Southern announced its intentions to move to the Football Bowl Subdivision level in April 2012. The university plans to raise $36.6 million over eight years to accommodate the move. Paulson Stadium will be expanded to FBS-standards by constructing a 57,000 square feet (5,295?m2) football operations center in the eastern end of the stadium and adding 6,300 seats on the north stands.[8] Additionally, students voted in favor of raising student athletic fees by $100 to accommodate the move. $25 of the fee increase will be used for the stadium expansion project while the remaining $75 is implemented as the \\"FBS Fee\\".[9]\\r\\nOn July 27, 2012, then-Athletics Director Sam Baker resigned. Baker was an ardent supporter of remaining in the FCS despite university president Brooks Keel's proclamation, mainly due to the financial ramifications of moving to a higher level. On November 12, 2012, President Keel named Tom Kleinlein as athletics director.[10] On March 27, 2013, Georgia Southern announced its move to the Sun Belt Conference on July 1, 2014, becoming bowl-eligible in 2015. In the 2013 season, Georgia Southern's football schedule remained the same, but it was ineligible for the Southern Conference title as well as the FCS playoffs. The university paid the Southern Conference $600,000 in exit fees.[11]\\r\\nOn January 10, 2014, Willie Fritz, formerly the head coach of the Sam Houston State Bearkats, was named as the Eagles' ninth modern era head coach and first of the FBS era.[12] In the Eagles' first FBS season, the team finished the season 9ÿ3 overall and was undefeated in Sun Belt Conference play at 8ÿ0, winning the outright conference championship. The Eagles became only the third team ever to win a conference title in its first FBS season, after Nevada in 1992 (Big West Conference) and Marshall in 1997 (Mid-American Conference). They were also the first team ever to go unbeaten in conference play in their first FBS season.[13] Since the Eagles were under transitional status, the university filed for a postseason waiver to allow the Eagles to play in a bowl game; however, the NCAA denied Georgia Southern's waiver request and a subsequent appeal since enough \\"full member\\" FBS teams became bowl-eligible during the season. In the 2015 season, Fritz led the Eagles to a 8-4 record, receiving their first bowl bid to the GoDaddy Bowl on December 23, 2015 against Bowling Green.\\r\\nOn December 11, 2015, Fritz resigned as the Eagles head coach to accept the head coaching position at Tulane University.[14] Assistant head coach and running backs coach Dell McGee was appointed as interim head coach for the GoDaddy Bowl game, where Georgia Southern defeated Bowling Green 58ÿ27.\\r\\nTyson Summers was hired on December 21, 2015 to succeed Fritz. In addition to serving as safeties coach for Georgia Southern during the 2006 season under Brian VanGorder, Summers had previously served as defensive coordinator and safeties coach at Colorado State in 2015.[15] During Summers' first season in 2016, Georgia Southern suffered its first losing season in the FBS era, and fourth overall in the modern era.[16] Summers was fired on October 22, 2017 after starting the 2017 season 0ÿ6. Assistant head coach Chad Lunsford was initially appointed as interim head coach for the remainder of the season[17] and was officially named head coach on November 27, 2017.[18] Lunsford finished his first half-season 2ÿ4, giving the Eagles an overall record of 2ÿ10, the worst record since football was started in 1924.\\r\\nThe Eagles have participated in one bowl game with a record of 1ÿ0.\\r\\nThe Eagles have appeared in the I-AA/FCS playoffs 19 times with an overall record of 45ÿ13. They are six time National Champions (1985, 1986, 1989, 1990, 1999, 2000) and two time National runner-up (1988, 1998).\\r\\nGeorgia Southern home football games are played at Allen E. Paulson Stadium. Paulson Stadium was dedicated on September 29, 1984, and has an official seating capacity of 25,000. The record attendance was on September 17, 2016 in the Georgia Southern-University Louisiana Monroe game.The Eagles beat UL Monroe 23-21 and set a new attendance record of 25,735. Prior to the Eagles' first FBS season, Paulson Stadium underwent a major expansion project that includes the addition of a new football operations center and an addition of more than 6,000 new seats.\\r\\nOfficial record (including any NCAA imposed vacates and forfeits) against all current Sun Belt opponents:\\r\\nThe Eagles have won six NCAA FCS National Championships, the most by any team in the nation.\\r\\n? indicates shared title.\\r\\nGeorgia Southern is one of five schools to have multiple Walter Payton Award winners honoring the top offensive player in the Football Championships Subdivision. Running Back Adrian Peterson won the award in 1999 and quarterback Jayson Foster won it in 2007.\\r\\nTwo Georgia Southern coaches have won the Eddie Robinson Award winners honoring the top coach in Division I-FCS. Erk Russell won it in 1989 and Paul Johnson in 1998. Tim Stowers also won the 1990 AFCA Kodak Coach of the Year Award voted on by his peers. Same award with a name change, with all three of the aforementioned voted on by the (AFCA) American Football Coaches Association membership.\\r\\nThe athletics teams of Georgia Southern University are referred to as the Eagles. However, the school has gone by a number of different nicknames. From as early as 1907 the teams of the then First District A&M school were referred to as the Culture to reflect the agricultural background of the school.[19] From 1924 to 1941, the nickname was the Blue Tide. After World War II, athletic teams were referred to as the Professors reflecting the school's status as a teacher-training college. However, in 1959 when the school was renamed Georgia Southern College, a student vote was held to determine the new mascot; among the 104 entries, voters chose Eagles over Colonels by a narrow margin. In 1997, a contest was held to select the official name of the mascot, incoming freshman Imen Edmond and Heidi Barber won with the name GUS.[20]\\r\\nWhen Georgia Southern resurrected football in 1981, it lacked tradition. A drainage ditch that the team had to cross several times a day during football practice came to be called Beautiful Eagle Creek by Coach Erk Russell. When the Eagles traveled to Northern Iowa during the 1985 playoffs, Russell took along a jug of this Eagle Creek water to sprinkle on the field.\\r\\nIn 1989 ESPN was to broadcast a Thursday Night Football game between Georgia Southern and the Middle Tennessee State Blue Raiders. However, Hurricane Hugo, a category 4 storm, was headed straight toward the coast of Georgia. Hugo ranked as the 11th most intense hurricane at time of landfall to strike the United States this century, with the highest ever recorded storm surge on the East Coast. Nevertheless, the decision was made to continue with the game. For safety purposes, an open line was kept between the press box at Paulson Stadium and the National Hurricane Center in Florida. The Eagles went on to defeat MTSU by a score of 26ÿ0 in a classic that will forever be known in Eagle history as the Hugo Bowl.\\r\\nThis was the first night game played at Paulson Stadium. Temporary lighting was used for the game because the stadium was not outfitted with permanent lighting until the 1994 season. Many feared that the booms used to hoist the stadium lights would tip over due to the heavy wind. While it was expected initially to be a sellout crowd, due to the approaching storm the actual attendance was in the neighborhood of only 3,000.\\r\\nThe uniforms consist of plain white pants, blue helmets with a white stripe down the middle and the player's number on the sides, and blue jerseys. This minimalist look was adopted more or less out of necessity. When the program was revived in 1982, the school did not have a large budget. Indeed, the equipment budget was so limited that only plain white practice pants could be purchased. Hence, the practice pants doubled as game pants. Russell bought solid blue helmets and had the players put a piece of tape down the middle.[21] With the subsequent success of the Eagles, the basic design has remained the same, with the only real changes in recent years being a white stripe down the middle of the helmets and the addition of names to the backs of the jerseys. Sports Illustrated has ranked the uniforms as being the third best in college football.\\r\\nWhen the football program was restarted in 1981, money was tight. In fact, there wasn't enough money to furnish transportation to home games. The Bulloch County school system sold two buses for a dollar each to the team. The buses have been used by the team ever since as transportation to Allen E. Paulson Stadium. This tradition continued even when the Eagles rose to powerhouse status. This briefly ended with the arrival of Brian VanGorder, following his scrapping of the Eagles' triple-option rushing attack. The tradition was revived after VanGorder's departure.\\r\\nIn 2011, Coach Jeff Monken's team took the field leading with a solid black flag. The flag symbolized their motto \\"No quarter given, no quarter taken.\\" During the game it was placed behind the bench. The flag was carried by safety Derek Heyden, who suffered a career ending neck injury early in the season.\\r\\nAnnounced schedules as of May 11, 2015\\r\\n[22]","input":"Who is the football coach at georgia southern?"},{"output":"three","context":"Toes are the digits of the foot of a tetrapod. Animal species such as cats that walk on their toes are described as being digitigrade. Humans, and other animals that walk on the soles of their feet, are described as being plantigrade; unguligrade animals are those that walk on hooves at the tips of their toes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are five toes present on each human foot. Each toe consists of three phalanx bones, the proximal, middle and distal, with the exception of the big toe (Latin: Hallux). The hallux only contains two phalanx bones, the proximal and distal. The joints between each phalanx are the interphalangeal joints. The proximal phalanx bone of each toe articulates with the metatarsal bone of the foot at the metatarsophalangeal joint. Each toe is surrounded by skin, and present on all five toes is a toenail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe toes are, from medial to lateral: \\r\\n\\r\\nToe movement is generally flexion and extension via muscular tendons that attach to the toes on the anterior and superior surfaces of the phalanx bones.[1]:573\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the exception of the hallux, toe movement is generally governed by action of the flexor digitorum brevis and extensor digitorum brevis muscles. These attach to the sides of the bones,[1]:572ÿ75 making it impossible to move individual toes independently. Muscles between the toes on their top and bottom also help to abduct and adduct the toes.[1]:579 The hallux and little toe have unique muscles:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe toes receive blood from the digital branches of the plantar metatarsal arteries and drain blood into the dorsal venous arch of the foot.[1]:580ÿ81\\r\\n\\r\\nSensation to the skin of the toes is provided by five nerves. The superficial fibular nerve supplies sensation to the top of the toes, except between the hallux and second toe, which is supplied by the deep fibular nerve, and the outer surface of the fifth toe, supplied by the sural nerve. Sensation to the bottom of the toes is supplied by the medial plantar nerve, which supplies sensation to the great toe and inner three-and-a-half toes, and the lateral plantar nerve, which supplies sensation to the little toe and half of the sensation of the fourth toe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn humans, the hallux is usually longer than the second toe, but in some individuals, it may not be the longest toe. There is an inherited trait in humans, where the dominant gene causes a longer second toe (\\"Morton's toe\\" or \\"Greek foot\\") while the homozygous recessive genotype presents with the more common trait: a longer hallux.[2] People with the rare genetic disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva characteristically have a short hallux which appears to turn inward, or medially, in relation to the foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nHumans usually have five toes on each foot. When more than five toes are present, this is known as polydactyly. Other variants may include syndactyly or arachnodactyly. Forefoot shape, including toe shape, exhibits significant variation among people; these differences can be measured and have been statistically correlated with ethnicity.[3]  Such deviations may affect comfort and fit for various shoe types. Research conducted for the U.S. Army indicated that larger feet may still have smaller arches, toe length, and toe-breadth.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe human foot consists of multiple bones and soft tissues which support the weight of the upright human. Specifically, the toes assist the human while walking,[5] providing balance, weight-bearing, and thrust during gait.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sprain or strain to the small interphalangeal joints of the toe is commonly called a stubbed toe. A sprain or strain where the toe joins to the foot is called turf toe.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong-term use of improperly sized shoes can cause misalignment of toes, as well as other orthopedic problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nMorton's neuroma commonly results in pain and numbness between the third and fourth toes of the sufferer, due to it affecting the nerve between the third and fourth metatarsal bones.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe big toe is also the most common locus of ingrown nails and gout attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeformities of the foot include hammer toe, trigger toe, and claw toe. Hammer toe can be described as an abnormal contraction or buckling of a toe. This is done by a partial or complete dislocation of one of the joints, which form the toes. Since the toes are deformed further, these may press against a shoe and cause pain. Deformities of the foot can also be caused by rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus. Deformities may predispose to ulcers and pain, especially when shoe-wearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nA common problem involving the big toe is the formation of bunions. These are structural deformities of the bones and the joint between the foot and big toe, and may be painful.[7] Similar deformity involving the fifth toe is described as tailor's bunion or bunionette.\\r\\n\\r\\nA favourable option for the reconstruction of missing adjacent fingers[8]/multiple digit amputations, i.e. such as a metacarpal hand reconstruction, is to have a combined second and third toe transplantation.[9] Third and fourth toe transplantation are also good.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Old English term for toe is ta (plural tan). This is a contraction of tahe, and derives from Proto-Germanic taihwo (cognates: Old Norse ta, Old Frisian tane, Middle Dutch te, Dutch teen (perhaps originally a plural), Old High German zecha, German Zehe). Perhaps originally meaning \\"fingers\\" as well (many Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) languages still use one word to mean both fingers and toes), and thus from PIE root deik  \\"to show\\".[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn classical Latin hallex,[12][13] allex,[12][14] hallus[12] and allus,[12] with genitive (h)allicis and (h)alli, are used to refer to the big toe. The form hallux (genitive, hallucis) currently in use is however a blend word of the aforementioned forms.[12][15] Compare pollex, the equivalent term for the thumb.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn birds with anisodactyl or heterodactyl feet, the hallux is opposed or directed backwards and allows for grasping and perching.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the thumb is often mentioned as one of the signature characteristics in humans, this manual digit remains partially primitive and is actually present in all primates. In humans, the most derived digital feature is the hallux.[16]","input":"How many bones are in your little toe?"},{"output":"private residence in Toms River, New Jersey","context":"The Amityville Horror is a 1979 American supernatural horror film based on Jay Anson's book of the same name (1977). Directed by Stuart Rosenberg, it features James Brolin and Margot Kidder as a young couple who purchase a home haunted by combative supernatural forces. The story is based on the alleged experiences of the Lutz family who bought a new home in Amityville, New York where a mass murder had been committed the year before. It is the first film based on the Amityville horror.\\r\\nUpon its release in the summer of 1979, The Amityville Horror was a major commercial success for American International Pictures, grossing over USD $80 million in the United States and going on to become one of the highest-grossing independent films of all time. It received mostly negative reviews from critics, though the film has been contemporarily noted by film scholars as a classic of the horror genre.[a]\\r\\nThe film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score by composer Lalo Schifrin and Kidder also earned a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress. A remake was produced in 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early morning hours on November 13, 1974, Ronald DeFeo Jr. murders his entire family with a shotgun at their home in Amityville, New York.\\r\\nOne year later, George and Kathy Lutz, a young married couple, move into the property. George appears not to be strong of faith, but Kathy is a Catholic in name at least. She has three children from her prior marriage: Greg, Matt, and Amy. The couple turn to Father Delaney to bless the home, but Delaney encounters troubles in trying to bless the home, including a room full of flies, out of season; violent stomach sickness; and later, blisters on his palm when trying to make a phone call to Kathy at their home. As he continues to help the Lutz Family, Delaney experiences more strange events (his car brakes and steering malfunction) and frustrations (lack of support by his superiors in the diocese). He ultimately appears to lose faith, becoming blind and having a breakdown.\\r\\nKathy's aunt, a nun, comes by the house one afternoon, but becomes violently ill. George begins to be more sullen and angry over perceived cold in the house, and obsesses with splitting logs and keeping the fireplace stoked. Before Kathy's brother's engagement party one night, $1,500 to be used for the caterer inexplicably goes missing in the house. Meanwhile, the babysitter watching Amy for the evening is locked inside a bedroom closet by an unseen force. Further unexplained incidents occur with one the two boys suffering a crushed hand when a sash window falls on it, and Amy having an imaginary friend, Jody, who seems to be of a malevolent nature. Kathy catches a glimpse of two red, swine-like eyes outside the daughter's second-story bedroom window. Even the family dog obsesses over a secret room in the basement.\\r\\nGeorge's land surveying business begins to suffer with his lack of attendance, and his partner grows concerned. His business partner's wife, very sensitive to the paranormal, is both repulsed and intrigued by the things she feels when at the house. Throughout the strange incidents, Kathy observes George's persistent waking up at 3:15 a.m., feeling he must go check on the boathouse. She also has nightmares, in which she is given details about the killings of the home's prior family. Research at the library and county records office suggest that the house is built atop a Shinnecock burial ground and that a known Satanic worshipper named John Ketchum had once lived on the land. She also discovers the news clippings about the DeFeo murders and notices Ronald DeFeo's striking resemblance to George.\\r\\nFinally, the paranormal events culminate one stormy night and drive the family to flee, abandoning their home and belongings. The final titles reads: \\"George and Kathleen Lutz and their family never reclaimed their house or their personal belongings. Today they live in another state.\\"\\r\\nProducer Samuel Z. Arkoff purchased the rights to the Anson novel by Jay Anson, which was a commercial success upon its publication in 1977.[5] Anson himself wrote a screenplay based on his work, but the script was rejected by Arkoff, and screenwriter Sandor Stern was assigned to write an entirely new script.[5] Initially, the film had been conceived as a made-for-television film.[5]\\r\\nBrolin was hesitant when first offered the role of George Lutz.[6] At the time of his casting, the script was unfinished, and so Brolin obtained a copy of Anson's novel to read. Brolin started the book and read until two o'clock in the morning. He had hung up a pair of his pants in the room earlier and during an especially tense passage of the book, the pants fell to the floor. Brolin jumped from his chair in fright. It was then that Brolin decided to do the film, convinced that the material would make an effective film.[6]\\r\\nKidder was cast in the role of Kathy Lutz after her breakthrough performance as Lois Lane in Superman the year prior.[6]\\r\\nThe on-location scenes of The Amityville Horror were filmed at a private residence in Toms River, New Jersey, which had been converted to look like the 112 Ocean Avenue home after authorities in Amityville denied permission for filming on the actual location.[5] Exterior scenes were also filmed in Toms River and Point Pleasant Beach. Local police and ambulance workers would play extras in the film, while the Toms River Volunteer Fire Company was used to provide the rain during several scenes. Indoor shots were filmed at the MGM studio lot in Los Angeles, California.[6][7]\\r\\nThe film shoot was widely publicized in national media when the studio attempted to concoct stories of \\"unusual\\" occurrences on the set (not dissimilar from what was claimed to have occurred during the filming of The Exorcist).[8] According to Brolin, he and Kidder were both asked by the studio and the press, \\"'Is there weird stuff going on?'... and we were looking for stuff now. We'd have liked to tell them, 'Oh yeah, you wouldn't believe the stuff that happened yesterdaymy lunch fell off the table in my lap.'\\"[6]\\r\\nLalo Schifrin's musical score was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score, but lost out to the score for A Little Romance by Georges Delerue. It is sometimes claimed that this score was the one rejected in 1973 for The Exorcist, but Schifrin has denied this in interviews.[9]\\r\\nIn promotion for the film's premiere, stars James Brolin and Margot Kidder visited the actual home at 112 Ocean Avenue, accompanied by the press.[6] Brolin would later reflect that the actual home was much more \\"condensed\\" than the location where the film was shot.[6] Both Brolin and Kidder were skeptics of the claims made in the book; \\"I didn't buy that this really had happened,\\" Kidder would say in a 2005 interview.[6] During the press junkets promoting the film, when asked whether she believed the Lutzes' claims, Kidder purportedly turned to the producers, who responded: \\"We'll never tell.\\"[6]\\r\\nThe Amityville Horror premiered in the United States on July 27, 1979. It was one of the most successful films produced by an independent studio at the time and was the most profitable AIP release since The Born Losers (1968).[4][10][11] The film grossed a total of $86,432,520 at the U.S. box office and was the second-highest-grossing film of 1979 in the United States alone.[12] It was the highest-grossing independent film of all time until 1990, when it was surpassed by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.[8]\\r\\nThough a commercial success, the film received generally negative reviews from critics such as Leonard Maltin and Roger Ebert, the latter describing it as \\"dreary and terminally depressing\\".[13] Based on 28 reviews, the film has a 29% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus: \\"Dull and disappointing, the best that can be said for The Amityville Horror is that it set a low bar for its many sequels and remakes.\\"[14] The film resulted in several lawsuits.[15]\\r\\nIn a 2012 retrospective on the film, historian James F. Broderick praised it, writing: \\"Director Stuart Rosenberg crafted an effective horror movie that succeeds largely because the performers take the over-the-top material seriously... The film is taut, tense, and filled with the bizarre, unsettling events chronicled in the book.\\"[5] In a 2013 assessment, John Kenneth Muir called The Amityville Horror a \\"blunt and effective horror film,\\" also noting author Stephen King's analysis of the film's subtext revolving around financial turmoil among the family: \\"If one follows King's lead, it's easy to contextualize The Amityville Horror as a financial nightmare... Similarly, the movie's dialogue constantly references financial matters. \\"Bills have to be paid,\\" says one character. \\"The IRS is calling,\\" warns another. 'They'll nickel and dime you to death\\" is a mantra not just about the bill collectors, perhaps, but a warning about the demons in the house.\\"[16]","input":"Where was the original amityville horror movie filmed?"},{"output":"roughly the late 15th century to the late 18th century","context":"Early modern Europe is the period of European history between the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, roughly the late 15th century to the late 18th century. Historians variously mark the beginning of the early modern period with the invention of moveable type printing in the 1450s, the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the end of the Wars of the Roses in 1487, the beginning of the High Renaissance in Italy in the 1490s, the end of the Reconquista and subsequent voyages of Christopher Columbus to the Americas in 1492, or the start of the Protestant Reformation in 1517. The precise dates of its end point also vary and are usually linked with either the start of the French Revolution in 1789 or with the more vaguely defined beginning of the Industrial Revolution in late 18th century England.\\r\\nSome of the more notable trends and events of the early modern period included the Reformation and the religious conflicts it provoked (including the French Wars of Religion and the Thirty Years' War), the rise of capitalism and modern nation states, and European colonization of the Americas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early modern period was characterized by profound changes in many realms of human endeavor. Among the most important include the development of science as a formalized practice, increasingly rapid technological progress, and the establishment of secularized civic politics, law courts and the nation state. Capitalist economies began to develop in a nascent form, first in the northern Italian republics such as Genoa and Venice and in the cities of the Low Countries, later in France, Germany and England. The early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the economic theory of mercantilism. As such, the early modern period is often associated with the decline and eventual disappearance (at least in Western Europe) of feudalism and serfdom. The Protestant Reformation greatly altered the religious balance of Christendom, creating a formidable new opposition to the dominance of the Catholic Church, especially in Northern Europe. The early modern period also witnessed the circumnavigation of the Earth and the establishment of regular European contact with the Americas and South and East Asia. The ensuing rise of global systems of international economic, cultural and intellectual exchange played an important role in the development of capitalism and represents the earliest phase of globalization.\\r\\nRegardless of the precise dates used to define its beginning and end points, the early modern period is generally agreed to have comprised the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment. As such, historians have attributed a number of fundamental changes to the period, notably the increasingly rapid progress of science and technology, the secularization of politics, and the diminution of the absolute authority of the Roman Catholic Church as well as the lessening of the influence of all faiths upon national governments. Many historians have identified the early modern period as the epoch in which individuals began to think of themselves as belonging to a national politya notable break from medieval modes of self-identification, which had been largely based upon religion (belonging to a universal Christendom), language, or feudal allegiance (belonging to the manor or extended household of a particular magnate or lord).\\r\\nThe beginning of the early modern period is not clear-cut, but is generally accepted to be in the late 15th century or early 16th century. Significant dates in this transitional phase from medieval to early modern Europe can be noted:\\r\\nThe end date of the early modern period is variously associated with the Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in about 1750, or the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789, which drastically transformed the state of European politics and ushered in the Napoleonic Era and modern Europe.\\r\\nThe role of nobles in the Feudal System had yielded to the notion of the Divine Right of Kings during the Middle Ages (in fact, this consolidation of power from the land-owning nobles to the titular monarchs was one of the most prominent themes of the Middle Ages). Among the most notable political changes included the abolition of serfdom and the crystallization of kingdoms into nation-states. Perhaps even more significantly, with the advent of the Reformation, the notion of Christendom as a unified political entity was destroyed. Many kings and rulers used this radical shift in the understanding of the world to further consolidate their sovereignty over their territories. For instance, many of the Germanic states (as well as English Reformation) converted to Protestantism in an attempt to slip out of the grasp of the Pope.\\r\\nThe intellectual developments of the period included the creation of the economic theory of mercantilism and the publication of enduringly influential works of political and social philosophy, such as Machiavelli's The Prince (1513) and Thomas More's Utopia (1515).\\r\\nThe Protestant Reformation was a reform-oriented schism from the Roman Catholic Church initiated by Martin Luther and continued by John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and other early Protestant Reformers. It is typically dated from 1517, lasting until the end of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. It was launched on 31 October 1517 by Martin Luther, who posted his 95 Theses criticizing the practice of indulgences to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany, commonly used to post notices to the University community. In was very widely publicized across Europe and caught fire. Luther began by criticizing the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the gospel. The Protestant position, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as sola scriptura and sola fide.\\r\\nThe Reformation ended in division and the establishment of new church movements. The four most important traditions to emerge directly from the Reformation were Lutheranism, the Reformed (also called Calvinist or Presbyterian) tradition, Anglicanism, and the Anabaptists. Subsequent Protestant churches generally trace their roots back to these initial four schools of the Reformation. It also led to the Catholic or Counter Reformation within the Roman Catholic Church through a variety of new spiritual movements, reforms of religious communities, the founding of seminaries, the clarification of Catholic theology as well as structural changes in the institution of the Church.[1] The largest groups were the Lutherans and Calvinists. Lutheran churches were founded mostly in Germany, the Baltics and Scandinavia, while the Reformed ones were founded in Switzerland, Hungary, France, the Netherlands and Scotland.[2]\\r\\nThe initial movement within Germany diversified, and other reform impulses arose independently of Luther. The availability of the printing press provided the means for the rapid dissemination of religious materials in the vernacular. The core motivation behind the Reformation was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded faith in the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought.[3]\\r\\nThere were also reformation movements throughout continental Europe known as the Radical Reformation, which gave rise to the Anabaptist, Moravian and other Pietistic movements.[4]\\r\\nThe Roman Catholic Church responded with a Counter-Reformation initiated by the Council of Trent. Much work in battling Protestantism was done by the well-organised new order of the Jesuits. In general, Northern Europe, with the exception of most of Ireland, came under the influence of Protestantism. Southern Europe remained Roman Catholic, while Central Europe was a site of a fierce conflict, culminating in the Thirty Years' War, which left it devastated.[5]\\r\\nThe Reformation reshaped the Church of England decisively after 1547. The separation of the Church of England (or Anglican Church) from Rome under Henry VIII, beginning in 1529 and completed in 1537, brought England alongside this broad Reformation movement; however, religious changes in the English national church proceeded more conservatively than elsewhere in Europe. Reformers in the Church of England alternated, for decades, between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles, gradually developing, within the context of robustly Protestant doctrine, a tradition considered a middle way (via media) between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions.[6]\\r\\nThe following outcomes of the Protestant Reformation regarding human capital formation, the Protestant ethic, economic development, governance, and \\"dark\\" outcomes have been identified by scholars.[7]\\r\\nMargaret C. Jacob argues that there has been a dramatic shift in the historiography of the Reformation. Until the 1960s, historians focused their attention largely on the great leaders and theologians of the 16th century, especially Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli. Their ideas were studied in depth. However, the rise of the new social history in the 1960s look at history from the bottom up, not from the top down. Historians began to concentrate on the values, beliefs and behavior of the people at large. She finds, \\"in contemporary scholarship, the Reformation is now seen as a vast cultural upheaval, a social and popular movement, textured and rich because of its diversity.\\"[8]\\r\\nThe Age of Enlightenment refers to the 18th century in European philosophy, and is often thought of as part of a period which includes the Age of Reason. The term also more specifically refers to a historical intellectual movement, The Enlightenment. This movement advocated rationality as a means to establish an authoritative system of aesthetics, ethics, and logic. The intellectual leaders of this movement regarded themselves as a courageous elite, and regarded their purpose as one of leading the world toward progress and out of a long period of doubtful tradition, full of irrationality, superstition, and tyranny, which they believed began during a historical period they called the Dark Ages. This movement also provided a framework for the American and French Revolutions, the Latin American independence movement, and the PolishÿLithuanian Commonwealth Constitution of May 3, and also led to the rise of liberalism and the birth of socialism and communism.[9] It is matched by the high baroque and classical eras in music, and the neo-classical period in the arts, and receives contemporary application in the unity of science movement which includes logical positivism.\\r\\nThe expression \\"early modern\\" is sometimes used as a substitute for the term Renaissance, and vice versa. However, \\"Renaissance\\" is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments; which occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of Europeespecially central and northern Italyand span the transition from late Medieval civilization and the opening of the early modern period.\\r\\nThe term early modern is most often applied to Europe, and its overseas empire. However, it has also been employed in the history of the Ottoman Empire. In the historiography of Japan, the Edo period from 1590 to 1868 is also sometimes referred to as the early modern period.\\r\\nThe 17th century saw very little peace in Europe ÿ major wars were fought in 95 years (every year except 1610, 1669 to 1671, and 1680 to 1682.)[10] The wars were unusually ugly. Europe in the late 17th century, 1648 to 1700, was an age of great intellectual, scientific, artistic and cultural achievement. Historian Frederick Nussbaum says it was:\\r\\nThe worst came during the Thirty Years' War, 1618-1648, which had an extremely negative impact on the civilian population of Germany and surrounding areas, with massive loss of life and disruption of the economy and society.\\r\\nThe Reformation led to a series of religious wars that culminated in the Thirty Years' War (1618ÿ1648), which devastated much of Germany, killing between 25% and 40% of its entire population.[12] Roman Catholic House of Habsburg and its allies fought against the Protestant princes of Germany, supported at various times by Denmark, Sweden and France. The Habsburgs, who ruled Spain, Austria, the Crown of Bohemia, Hungary, Slovene Lands, the Spanish Netherlands and much of Germany and Italy, were staunch defenders of the Roman Catholic Church. Some historians believe that the era of the Reformation came to a close when Roman Catholic France allied itself with Protestant states against the Habsburg dynasty. For the first time since the days of Martin Luther, political and national convictions again outweighed religious convictions in Europe.\\r\\nTwo main tenets of the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War, were:\\r\\nThe treaty also effectively ended the Papacy's pan-European political power. Pope Innocent X declared the treaty \\"null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all times\\" in his bull Zelo Domus Dei. European sovereigns, Roman Catholic and Protestant alike, ignored his verdict.[13]\\r\\nScholars taking a \\"realist\\" perspective on wars and diplomacy have emphasized the Peace of Westphalia (1648) as a dividing line. It ended the Thirty Years War (1618-1648), where religion and ideology had been powerful motivating forces for warfare. Westphalia, in the realist view, ushered in a new international system of sovereign states of roughly equal strength, dedicated not to ideology or religion but to enhance status, and territorial gains. The Catholic Church, for example, no longer devoted its energies to the very difficult task of reclaiming dioceses lost to Protestantism, but to build large-scale missions in overseas colonial possessions that could convert the natives by the thousands Using devoted members of society such as the Jesuits.[14] According to Scott Hamish, the realist model assumes that \\"foreign policies were guided entirely by \\"Realpolitik,\\" by the resulting struggle for resources and, eventually, by the search for what became known as a 'balance of power.'[15]\\r\\nDiplomacy before 1700 was not well developed, and chances to avoid wars were too often squandered. In England, for example, King Charles II paid little attention to diplomacy, which proved disastrous. During the Dutch war of 1665-67, England had no diplomats stationed in Denmark or Sweden. When King Charles realized he needed them as allies, he sent special missions that were uninformed about local political, military, and diplomatic situations, and were ignorant of personalities and political factionalism. Ignorance produced a series of blunders that ruined their efforts to find allies.[16] King Louis XIV of France, by contrast, developed the most sophisticated diplomatic service, with permanent ambassadors and lesser ministers in major and minor capitals, all preparing steady streams of information and advice to Paris. Diplomacy became a career that proved highly attack attractive to rich senior aristocrats who enjoyed very high society at royal courts, especially because they carried the status of the most powerful nation in Europe. Increasingly, other nations copied the French model; French became the language of diplomacy, replacing Latin.[17] By 1700, the British and the Dutch, with small land armies, large navies, and large treasuries, used astute diplomacy to build alliances, subsidizing as needed land powers to fight on their side, or as in the case of the Hessians, hiring regiments of soldiers from mercenary princes in small countries.[18] The balance of power was very delicately calculated, so that winning a battle here was worth the slice of territory there, with no regard to the wishes of the inhabitants. Important peacemaking conferences at Utrecht (1713), Vienna (1738), Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) and Paris (1763) had a cheerful, cynical, game-like atmosphere in which professional diplomats cashed in victories like casino chips in exchange for territory.[19]\\r\\nThe Ancien Rgime (French for \\"old regime\\") was the political and social system of the Kingdom of France from the about 1450 until the |French Revolution that started in 1789.[20] The Ancien Rgime was ruled by the late Valois and Bourbon dynasties. Much of the medieval political centralization of France had been lost in the Hundred Years' War, and the Valois Dynasty's attempts at re-establishing control over the scattered political centres of the country were hindered by the Huguenot Wars (or Wars of Religion). Much of the reigns of Henry IV, Louis XIII and the early years of Louis XIV were focused on administrative centralisation. Despite, however, the notion of \\"absolute monarchy\\" (typified by the king's right to issue lettres de cachet) and the efforts by the kings to create a centralized state, Ancien Rgime France remained a country of systemic irregularities: administrative (including taxation), legal, judicial, and ecclesiastic divisions and prerogatives frequently overlapped, while the French nobility struggled to maintain their own rights in the matters of local government and justice, and powerful internal conflicts (like the Fronde) protested against this centralization.[21]\\r\\nThe need for centralization in this period was directly linked to the question of royal finances and the ability to wage war. The internal conflicts and dynastic crises of the 16th and 17th centuries (the Huguenot Wars between Catholics and Protestants and the Habsburg's internal family conflict) and the territorial expansion of France in the 17th century demanded great sums which needed to be raised through taxes, such as the land tax (taille) and the tax on salt (gabelle) and by contributions of men and service from the nobility. Tne key to this centralization was the replacing of personal patronage systems organized around the king and other nobles by institutional systems around the state.[22] The creation of intendantsrepresentatives of royal power in the provincesdid much to undermine local control by regional nobles. The same was true of the greater reliance shown by the royal court on the \\"noblesse de robe\\" as judges and royal counselors. The creation of regional parlements had initially the same goal of facilitating the introduction of royal power into newly assimilated territories, but as the parlements gained in self-assurance, they began to be sources of disunity.[23]\\r\\nThis period refers to England 1558ÿ1603. The Elizabethan Era is the period associated with the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558ÿ1603) and was a golden age in English cultural history. It was the height of the English Renaissance, and saw the flowering of English literature and poetry. This was also the time during which Elizabethan theatre grew. William Shakespeare, among others, composed highly innovative and powerful plays. It was an age of expansion and exploration abroad. At home the Protestant Reformation was established and successfully defended against the Catholic powers of Spain and France.[24]\\r\\nThe Jacobean era was the reign James I of England (1603ÿ1625). Overseas exploration and establishment of trading factories sped up, with the first permanent settlements in North America at Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, in Newfoundland in 1610, and at Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts in 1620. One king now ruled England and Scotland; the latter was fully absorbed by the Acts of Union 1707.[25]\\r\\nThe tumultuous Caroline era was the reign of King Charles I (1625ÿ1645), followed by his beheading by Oliver Cromwell's regime in 1649 . The Caroline era was dominated by the growing religious, political, and social conflict between the King and his supporters, termed the Royalist party, and the Puritan opposition that evolved in response to particular aspects of Charles' rule. The colonization of North America continued apace, with new colonies in Maryland (1634), Connecticut (1635), and Rhode Island (1636).[26]\\r\\nMuch like the rest of Europe in the early modern period Spain followed clearly differentiated gender roles.[27] These roles came from many places, such as biblical references, church practices, and in the case of women, manuals such as Fray Luis de Le܇n's La Perfecta Casada.[27][28]\\r\\nUnder the rule of Elizabeth, gender dynamics were altered. The masculine tournaments of Henry VIII's rule were \\"transformed into a vehicle for spectacular display and expanded the masque-like elements.\\" [29] It was generally regarded as a show rather than an actual military practice as they were viewed under Henry.[30]","input":"When did the modern age in europe begin?"},{"output":"20,000-40,000 YBP","context":"","input":"How many years ago did wolves evolve into dogs?"},{"output":"Paruresis","context":"Paruresis (/?p?r??ri?s?s/ PAR-?-REE-sis) is a type of phobia in which the sufferer is unable to urinate in the real or imaginary presence of others, such as in a public restroom. The analogous condition that affects bowel movement is called parcopresis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears that paruresis involves a tightening of the sphincter and/or bladder neck due to a sympathetic nervous system response. The adrenaline rush that produces the involuntary nervous system response probably has peripheral and central nervous system involvement. The internal urethral sphincter (smooth muscle tissue) or the external urethral sphincter (striated muscle), levator ani (especially the pubococcygeus) muscle area, or some combination of the above, may be involved. It is possible that there is an inhibition of the detrusor command through a reflex pathway as well. The pontine micturition center (Barrington's nucleus) also may be involved, as its inhibition results in relaxation of the detrusor and prevents the relaxation of the internal sphincter.[1]\\r\\nSome people have brief, isolated episodes of urinary difficulty in situations where other people are in close proximity. Paruresis, however, goes beyond simple shyness, embarrassment, fear of exposure, or fear of being judged for not being able to urinate. Other people may find that they are unable to urinate while in moving vehicles, or are fixated on the sounds of their urination in quiet restrooms or residential settings. In severe cases, a person with paruresis can urinate only when alone at home or through the process of catheterization.[2]\\r\\nAlthough most sufferers report that they developed the condition in their teenage years, it can strike at any age. Also, because of the differing levels of severity from one person to another, some people first experience the problem when they \\"lock up\\" for the first time attempting to produce a sample for a drug test or alcohol test. Many women are unaware that they, too, are subject to paruresis; articles about women and urination emphasize other female urinary dysfunctions, such as urinary incontinence or frequent urination.\\r\\nSome people cope by deliberately holding in their urine, by refraining from drinking liquids, or locating unoccupied or single-occupancy public bathrooms.\\r\\nSevere cases of this disorder can have highly restricting effects on a person's life. In moderate to severe cases, overcoming paruresis can be extremely difficult without the help of a psychologist, therapist or support groups. Severe sufferers may not be willing to travel far from their home or be able to form intimate relationships. Others cannot urinate even in their own home if someone else can be heard to be there.\\r\\nSometimes paruresis can be overcome by someone nearby turning a water tap/faucet on and letting the water run noisily.\\r\\nThe term paruresis was coined by Williams and Degenhart (1954) in their paper \\"Paruresis: a survey of a disorder of micturition\\" in the Journal of General Psychology 51:19-29. They surveyed 1,419 college students and found 14.4% had experienced paruresis, either incidentally or continuously.\\r\\nParuresis is also known by many colloquial terms, including bashful bladder, bashful kidneys, stage fright, pee-shyness, and shy bladder syndrome.\\r\\nThere is growing recognition of the condition by the UK's National Health Service (NHS) and government. The condition is catered for in the rules for mandatory urine testing for drugs in UK prisons, and UK Incapacity Benefit tribunals also recognise it. It is listed in the NHS on-line encyclopaedia of conditions and disorders.[3] It is now reported to have been accepted as a valid reason for jury service excusal.[4] From 1 August 2005, the guidance on the rules relating to the testing of those on probation in the UK explicitly cites paruresis as a valid reason for inability to produce a sample which is not to be construed as a refusal.\\r\\nThe condition is recognised by the American Urological Association, who include it in their on-line directory of conditions.[5]\\r\\nIt has, from time to time been the topic of advice columns such as Ann Landers, to which sufferers have written in and been counselled on their problem.\\r\\nParuresis was described in section 300.23 of the DSM-IV-TR as \\"performance fears . . . using a public restroom\\" but it was not mentioned by name.[6] The current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) mentions paruresis by name.[7][8]\\r\\nKaplan & Sadock's Synopsis of Psychiatry states, \\"Persons with social phobias (also called social anxiety disorder) have excessive fears of humiliation or embarrassment in various social settings, such as in speaking in public, urinating in a public rest room (also called shy bladder), and speaking to a date.\\"[9] The Synopsis describes shy bladder as \\"inability to void in a public bathroom\\" and notes that relaxation exercises are an application of behavior therapy for dealing with this disorder.[10] Some paruretics experience delayed urination and must wait for their need to void to overcome their anxiety, while others are unable to urinate at all.[11]\\r\\nThere can be serious difficulties with workplace drug testing where observed urine samples are insisted upon, if the testing regime does not recognise and cater for the condition. In the UK, employees have a general right not to be unfairly dismissed, and so have an arguable defence if this arises, but this is not the case everywhere.\\r\\nThere is growing evidence to suggest that some drug testing authorities find paruresis a nuisance, and some implement \\"shy bladder procedures\\" which pay no more than lip service to the condition, and where there is no evidence that they have conducted any real research into the matter. In the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, the Code of Federal Regulations provides that \\"An inmate is presumed to be unwilling if the inmate fails to provide a urine sample within the allotted time period. An inmate may rebut this presumption during the disciplinary process.\\"[12] Although U.S. courts have ruled that failure to treat properly diagnosed paruresis might violate prisoner's constitutional rights, the courts have also \\"routinely rejected suspicious or unsubstantiated attempts to invoke it in defense of failure to complete drug testing,\\"[13] particularly when there were no medical record or physician testimony to back up the claim of paruresis.[14] The International Paruresis Association stresses the importance of medical documentation of one's condition since \\"[t]he person who is unable to produce a urine sample is presumed guilty in the absence of any evidence.\\"[15] Some prisons have offered the use of a \\"dry cell\\"i.e., a cell with no toilet facilities, but only a container for the prisoner's wasteas an accommodation to inmates who are hindered by paruresis from providing an observed urine sample.[16]\\r\\nFBOP Program Statement 6060.08 states, \\"Ordinarily, an inmate is expected to provide a urine sample within two hours of the request, but the Captain (or Lieutenant) may extend the time if warranted by specific situations (for example, the inmate has a documented medical or psychological problem, is dehydrated, etc.). Staff may consider supervising indirectly an inmate who claims to be willing but unable to provide a urine sample under direct visual supervision. For example, this might be accomplished by allowing the inmate to provide the sample in a secure, dry room after a thorough search has been made of both the inmate and the room.\\"[17] At least six state prison systems  Florida,[18] Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New York[19] and Tennessee[20]  have modified their drug testing regulations to provide accommodations for prisoners with paruresis.[21]\\r\\nPer the Handbook of Correctional Mental Health, \\"No definitive or objective test is available to confirm or refute the presence of paruresis. The absence of prior treatment or the ability to void in some social situations but not in others does not rule it out. Although modalities associated with the treatment of social phobias help some individuals, no universally effective medication or other treatment exists. Coercive interventions, such as forcing fluids while observing a person with paruresis, are ineffective and can cause serious medical complications. Alternatives to observed urine specimen collection for individuals who self-report paruresis include unobserved collections in a dry room, testing of hair specimens, sweat testing with a patch, and blood testing ('Test for Drugs of Abuse' 2002). These alternatives preclude the need for futile attempts to differentiate inmates with true paruresis from those who fabricate complaints.\\"[22]\\r\\nIn terms of treating the mental aspect of paruresis, such treatment can be achieved by graduated exposure therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. In graduated exposure therapy, the subject has a trusted person stand outside the restroom at first, and once the fear is overcome the observer is brought closer in, until step by step the phobia is vanquished.[23] The International Paruresis Association provides a detailed discussion of this method on its website.[24] In addition to gradual exposure therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy is used to change a sufferer's mental approach to the condition, from one of a person who cannot urinate, to a person who can urinate or is not overly fearful when they can't publicly urinate.\\r\\nThe condition has been occasionally portrayed in popular culture, sometimes for comedic effect or parody. Examples of this include:","input":"What is the fear of public restrooms called?"},{"output":"the amygdala","context":"Many experiments have been done to find out how the brain interprets stimuli and how animals develop fear responses. The emotion, fear, has been hard-wired into almost every individual, due to its vital role in the survival of the individual. Researchers have found that fear is established unconsciously and that the amygdala is involved with fear conditioning.\\r\\nBy understanding how fear is developed within individuals, it may be possible to treat human mental disorders such as anxiety, phobia, and posttraumatic stress disorder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fear conditioning, the main circuits that are involved are the sensory areas that process the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli, certain regions of the amygdala that undergo plasticity (or long-term potentiation) during learning, and the regions that bear an effect on the expression of specific conditioned responses. These pathways converge in the lateral amygdala. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic plasticity that enhances the response of lateral amygdala neurons to the conditioned stimulus occurs in the lateral amygdala. As a result, the conditioned stimulus is then able to flow from the lateral amygdala to the central nucleus of the amygdala. The basal and intercalated masses of the amygdala connect the lateral amygdala with the central nucleus of the amygdala directly and indirectly. Pathways from central nucleus of the amygdala to downstream areas then control defensive behavior (freezing) and autonomic and endocrine responses. Recent studies implicate the prelimbic cortex in fear expression as well, possibly by way of its connections to the basal and then to the central nucleus of the amygdala.[1]\\r\\nIt has been observed that fear can contribute to behavioral changes.[2] One way this phenomenon has been studied is on the basis of the repeated stress model done by Camp RM et al.(among others). In this particular study, it was examined that the contribution fear conditioning may play a huge role in altering an animal's (Fischer rat's) behavior in a repeated stress paradigm. Behavioral changes that are commonly referred to as depressive-like behaviors resulted from this model of testing. After setting a control and a valid experimental design, Fischer rats were exposed daily to different stressors in a complex environment. After four days of stressor exposure, both exploratory behavior and social interaction were tested on day 5 in either the same environment or a new environment. The rats showed much decreased exploration and social interaction when tested in different contexts compared to control rats.[3] To further make a correlation to the biochemistry (as mentioned below), chronic infusion of propranolol (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist) prevented the behavioral changes following repeated stressor exposure thus halting long term potentiation. Some physiological changes also occurred including the decrease in body weight gain and adrenal hypertrophy observed in animals exposed to stress. Overall, the conditioned fear responses can contribute to behavioral changes in a repeated stress paradigm. This can be extended to correlate to other animals as well but with varying degrees of responses.[3]\\r\\nMolecular mechanisms that have been linked directly to the behavioral expression of conditioning are easier to study in a clinical setting as opposed to mechanisms that underlie long-term potentiation (LTP), in which synaptic plasticity is induced by electrical or chemical stimulation of lateral amygdala circuits. LTP is important for fear processing because it strengthens the synapses in neural circuits.[4] These strengthened synapses are how long-term memory is developed and how fear is developed.[5]\\r\\nSynaptic input can be strengthened when activity in the presynaptic neuron co-occurs with depolarization in the postsynaptic neuron. This is known as Hebbian synaptic plasticity. This hypothesis is especially appealing as an explanation for how simple associative learning, such as that taking place in fear conditioning, might occur. In this model of fear conditioning, strong depolarization of the lateral amygdala elicited by the stimulus leads to the strengthening of temporally and spatially relative conditioned stimulus inputs (that are coactive) onto the same neurons. Experimental data has been shown to support the idea that the plasticity and fear memory formation in the lateral amygdala are triggered by unconditioned stimulus-induced activation of the region's neurons.[1] Thus, unconditioned stimulus-evoked depolarization is necessary for the enhancement of conditioned stimulus-elicited neural responses in this region after conditioned-unconditioned pairing and pairing a conditioned stimulus with direct depolarization of the lateral amygdala's pyramidal neurons as an unconditioned stimulus supports fear conditioning. It is also clear that synaptic plasticity at conditioned stimulus input pathways to the lateral amygdala does occur with fear conditioning.[1]\\r\\nHebbian plasticity is believed to involve N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and are located on postsynaptic neurons in the lateral amygdala. NMDARs are known to be coincidence detectors of presynaptic activity and postsynaptic depolarization. Auditory inputs are NMDARs in the lateral amygdala and use glutamate as a transmitter.[6] Furthermore, it was tested that when the region's neurons that received auditory inputs also received unconditioned stimulus inputs and broad spectrum NMDAR antagonists in the lateral amygdala resulted in the disruption of the acquisition of fear learning. Therefore, these receptors are crucial to the metabolic pathway of processing and eliciting for the percept of fear.[7]\\r\\nIt is believed that monoamine transmitters such as norepinepherine and dopamine that are released in emotional situations function in regulating glutamatergic transmission and Hebbian plasticity. The modulation of all of the different types of plasticity is called heterosynaptic plasticity. Homosynaptic plasticity is also prevalent which consists solely of the Hebbian plasticity. In a variety of model systems, it has been shown that monoamines modulate plasticity underlying memory formation such as a heightened percept of fear.[8] Neuromodulators also contribute to fear conditioning.[9] The Hebbian mechanisms contribute to plasticity in the lateral amygdala and fear learning. Other modulators apart from the Hebbian mechanisms include serotonin, acetylcholine, endocannabinoids, and various peptides (such as gastrin-releasing peptide, NPY, opiates, and oxytocin) but the role of these compounds are not fully understood.\\r\\nNorepinephrine is a huge player in fear memory formation. Recent studies have demonstrated that the blockade of norepinephrine -adrenergic receptors (-ARs) in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala interferes with the acquisition of fear learning when given pretraining stimuli but has no effect when applied posttraining or before memory retrieval. In contrast to effects of -AR receptor blockade on other forms of learning, this effect is specific to only acquisition, as opposed to the posttraining processing or expression of fear memory.[10] The activation of -ARs in the lateral amygdala synergistically regulates Hebbian processes to trigger the neuron's associative plasticity and fear learning in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. One theory suggests that the mechanism of -AR involvement in the acquisition of fear learning is that they act on GABAergic interneurons to suppress feed-forward inhibition and enhance Hebbian plasticity. -ARs are found on GABAergic interneurons as well as in the lateral amygdala's pyramidal cells. The process of activation of -ARs start off by coupling to G protein signaling cascades, which then activate protein kinase A (PKA). This activation can elicits the phosphorylation of NMDARs as well as the ser845 site on GluA1, which could facilitate AMPAR insertion at the synapse.\\r\\nDopamine receptor activation (both D1 and D2 receptor subtypes) in the amygdala contributes to the acquisition of fear conditioning. D1 and D2 receptors are G protein coupled and inhibit adenylate cyclase (Gi-coupled) and stimulate adenylate cyclase (Gs-coupled), respectively. Just like -ARs, dopamine receptors may modulate Hebbian processes directly by reducing feed-forward inhibition. They may also act in a parallel fashion with Hebbian mechanisms to implement synapses in the lateral amygdala and promote plasticity and fear learning through their respective signaling pathways.[11]\\r\\nPlasticity and learning can also be modulated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). The proteins mGluRs likely serve a modulatory function and do not participate directly in Hebbian processes. This is because due to the fact these receptors do not contribute to depolarization during synapses. They are also not activated by receptors that participate in Hebbian processes. Finally, they do not detect pre- and postsynaptic neural activity. However, the activation of group I mGluRs in the lateral amygdala and basal nucleus enhances the acquisition, reduction, and amplification of fear conditioning by providing an influx of calcium ions.\\r\\nResearch studies have shown that damage to the bilateral amygdala[12] affects mostly the recognition of fear. In a specific study conducted by Andrew J. Calder and Andrew W. Young, they had subjects classify morphed images of facial expressions ranging from happiness to surprise to fear to sadness to disgust to anger. While control subjects classified these images to the nearest expression, subjects who had damage to the bilateral amygdala had problems with this task, especially with the recognition of facial expressions that show fear. The subjects with the damaged bilateral amygdala had no problems differentiating happiness from sadness, but they could not differentiate the expression of anger from fear.[13]\\r\\nHowever, in an experiment conducted by Ralph Adolphs, it elucidated the mechanism of the impaired fear recognition. Adolphs found that his main subject, who had a rare bilateral amygdala damage, could not discern fear expressions because of her inability to look at the eye region of the face. When the subject was instructed to look directly at the eye region of faces with expression, the subject could recognize fear expressions of faces.[14] Although the amygdala does play an important part in the recognition of fear, further research shows that there are alternate pathways that are capable to support fear learning in the absence of a functional amygdala.[15] A study by Kazama also shows that although the amygdala may be damaged, it is still possible for patients to distinguish the difference between safety cues and fear.[16]\\r\\nThere has been a substantial amount of research done on conditioned stimuli, where a neutral stimulus, such as a flash of light, is paired with a shock is given to a rat. The result of this conditioned stimulus is to provoke the unconditioned response, fear. The once neutral stimulus is given again to see if the rat would show the responses of fear. However, because fear responses involve many behaviors, it is important to see which behaviors are exhibited when the conditioned stimulus is given.[2]\\r\\nInitially, the visual stimuli is first received by the visual thalamus and relayed to the amygdala for potential danger. The visual thalamus also relays the information to the visual cortex and is processed to see if the stimuli poses a potential threat. If so, this information is relayed to the amygdala and the muscle contraction, increased heart rate and blood pressure begins, thus activating the sympathetic neuronal pathway. A presentation of a neutral visual stimuli has been shown to intensify the percept of fear or suspense induced by a different channel of information, such as audition.[17] From Le Doux's research, it shows that sound stimuli are not directly relayed from the auditory thalamus to the central nucleus.[12]\\r\\nThe perception of fear is elicited by many different stimuli and involves the process described above in biochemical terms. Neural correlates of the interaction between language and visual information has been studied by Roel Willems et al.[18] The study consisted of observing how visual and linguistic information interact in the perception of emotion. A common phenomenon from film theory was borrowed which states that the presentation of a neutral visual scene intensifies the percept of fear or suspense induced by a different channel of information, such as language. This principle has been applied in a way in which the percept of fear was present and amplified in the presence of a neutral visual stimuli. The main idea is that the visual stimuli intensify the fearful content of the stimuli (i.e. language) by subtly implying and concretizing what is described in the context (i.e. sentence). Activation levels in the right anterior temporal pole were selectively increased and is believed to serve as a binding function of emotional information across domains such as visual and linguistic information.[19]\\r\\nExposure to different types of emotion and levels of arousal also appear to influence pain through an interaction known as the valence-by-arousal interaction. During this reaction, negative emotions experienced by an individual with low levels of arousal tend to cause enhanced pain while negative valenced emotions with higher levels of arousal have been observed to decrease the perception of pain. Low levels of arousal would include reactive emotions such as anxiety while higher levels of arousal include emotions such as fear.[20]","input":"What is the fear center of the brain?"},{"output":"William Laws Calley Jr.","context":"Vietnam War\\r\\nWilliam Laws Calley Jr.[1] (born June 8, 1943) is a former United States Army officer convicted by court-martial of murdering 22 unarmed South Vietnamese civilians in the My Lai Massacre on March 16, 1968, during the Vietnam War. While not technically exonerated, after three and a half years of house arrest, Calley was released pursuant to a ruling by federal judge J. Robert Elliott who found that Calley's trial had been prejudiced by pre-trial publicity, denial of subpoenas of certain defense witnesses, refusal of the United States House of Representatives to release testimony taken in executive session of its My Lai investigation, and inadequate notice of the charges. His initial conviction faced widespread public opposition both due to the campaign circumstances of civilian embedded Viet Cong, and due to Calley being singled out as the sole officer convicted with respect to the massacre.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCalley was born in Miami, Florida. His father, also William Laws Calley, was a United States Navy veteran of World War II. Calley Jr. graduated from Miami Edison High School in Miami and then attended Palm Beach Junior College in 1963. He dropped out in 1964 after receiving unsatisfactory grades, consisting of one C, two Ds, and four Fs.[3]\\r\\nCalley then worked at a variety of jobs before enlistment, including as a bellhop, dishwasher, salesman, insurance appraiser, and train conductor.[4]\\r\\nCalley underwent eight weeks of basic combat training at Fort Bliss, Texas,[5] followed by eight weeks of advanced individual training as a company clerk at Fort Lewis, Washington. Having scored high enough on his Armed Forces Qualification tests, he applied for and was subsequently accepted into Officer Candidate School (OCS).[4]\\r\\nHe then began 26 weeks of junior officer training at Fort Benning in mid-March 1967. Upon graduating from OCS Class No. 51 on September 7, 1967,[4] he was commissioned a second lieutenant of infantry. Following his commission, Calley was assigned to 1st Platoon, Company C, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 11th Infantry Brigade,[1] and began training at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, in preparation for deployment to South Vietnam.\\r\\nCalley's evaluations described him as \\"average\\" as an officer.[3] Later, as the My Lai investigation progressed, a more negative picture emerged. Men in his platoon reported to army investigators that Calley lacked common sense and could not read a map or compass properly.[6]\\r\\nA number of men assigned under Calley claimed he was so disliked that some secretly discussed and considered fragging him.[7]\\r\\nThe events in My Lai had initially been covered up by the U.S. Army.[8] In April 1969, nearly 13 months after the massacre, Ron Ridenhour, a GI who had been with the 11th Brigade, wrote letters to the President, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense and 30 members of Congress. In these letters Ridenhour described some of the atrocities by the soldiers at My Lai that he had been told about.[citation needed]\\r\\nCalley was charged on September 5, 1969, with six specifications of premeditated murder for the deaths of 109 South Vietnamese civilians near the village of S?n M?, at a hamlet called My Lai, simply referred to as \\"My Lai\\" in the U.S. press. As many as 500 villagersmostly women, children, infants, and the elderlyhad been systematically killed by American soldiers during a bloody rampage on March 16, 1968. Upon conviction, Calley could have faced the death penalty. On November 12, 1969, investigative reporters Seymour Hersh[9] and Wayne Greenhaw[10] broke the story and revealed that Calley had been charged with murdering 109 Vietnamese.[11]\\r\\nCalley's trial started on November 17, 1970. It was the military prosecution's contention that Calley, in defiance of the rules of engagement, ordered his men to deliberately murder unarmed Vietnamese civilians even though his men were not under enemy fire at all. Testimony revealed that Calley had ordered the men of 1st Platoon, Company C, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry of the 23rd Infantry Division to kill everyone in the village.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn presenting the case, the two military prosecutors, Aubrey M. Daniel, III and John Partin, were hamstrung by the reluctance of many soldiers to testify against Calley. In addition president Richard M. Nixon made public statements prior to the trial that were prejudicial to the defense, resulting in a letter from Daniel taking the president to task. Some soldiers refused to answer questions point-blank on the witness stand by citing the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.[citation needed]\\r\\nHowever, one holdout, a soldier in Calley's unit named Paul Meadlo, after being jailed for contempt of court by the presiding judge, Reid W. Kennedy, reluctantly agreed to testify. In his testimony, Meadlo described that during the day's events, he was standing guard over a few dozen My Lai villagers when Lieutenant Calley approached him and ordered him to shoot all the civilians.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen Meadlo balked at the orders, Calley backed off 40 feet (6 m) or more and opened fire on the people himself, and Meadlo joined in. Another witness named Dennis Conti, who was also reluctant to testify, described the carnage, claiming that Calley had started it and the rest of the 105 soldiers of Charlie Company followed suit. Another witness, named Leonard Gonzalez, told of seeing one of the soldiers of Calley's unit herd some men and women villagers together and order them to strip off their clothing. When the villagers refused, the enraged soldier fired a single round from his M-79 grenade launcher into the crowd, killing everyone.[citation needed]\\r\\nCalley's original defense, that the death of the villagers was the result of an accidental airstrike, was overcome by the few prosecution witnesses. In his new defense, Calley claimed he was following the orders of his immediate superior, Captain Ernest Medina. Whether this order was actually given is disputed; Medina was acquitted of all charges relating to the incident at a separate trial in August 1971.[12]\\r\\nTaking the witness stand, Calley, under the direct examination by his civilian defense lawyer George W. Latimer, claimed that on the previous day, his commanding officer, Captain Medina, made it clear that his unit was to move into the village and that everyone was to be shot, saying that they all were Viet Cong.[citation needed]\\r\\nTwenty-one other members of Calley's \\"Charlie\\" Company also testified in Calley's defense and corroborated the orders. But Medina publicly denied that he had ever given such orders and stated that he had meant enemy soldiers, while Calley assumed that his order to \\"kill the enemy\\" meant to kill everyone. In his personal statement, Calley stated that,\\r\\nI was ordered to go in there and destroy the enemy. That was my job that day. That was the mission I was given. I did not sit down and think in terms of men, women, and children. They were all classified as the same, and that's the classification that we dealt with over there, just as the enemy. I felt then and I still do that I acted as I was directed, and I carried out the order that I was given and I do not feel wrong in doing so.\\r\\nAfter deliberating for 79 hours, the six-officer jury (five of whom had served in Vietnam) convicted him on March 29, 1971, of the premeditated murder of 22 Vietnamese civilians. On March 31, 1971, Calley was sentenced to life imprisonment and hard labor at Fort Leavenworth,[13] which includes the United States Disciplinary Barracks, the Department of Defense's only maximum security prison. Calley was the only one of the 26 officers and soldiers initially charged for their part in the My Lai Massacre or the subsequent cover-up [clarification needed]. Many observers[who?] saw My Lai as a direct result of the military's attrition strategy with its emphasis on body counts and kill ratios.\\r\\nMany in the United States were outraged by Calley's sentence. Georgia's Governor, Jimmy Carter, future President of the United States instituted American Fighting Man's Day, and asked Georgians to drive for a week with their lights on.[14] Indiana's Governor Edgar Whitcomb asked that all state flags be flown at half-staff for Calley, and the governors of Utah and Mississippi also publicly disagreed with the verdict.[14] The legislatures of Arkansas, Kansas, Texas, New Jersey, and South Carolina requested clemency for Calley.[14] Alabama's governor, George Wallace, visited Calley in the stockade and requested that President Richard Nixon pardon him. After the conviction, the White House received over 5,000 telegrams; the ratio was 100 to 1 in favor of leniency.[15] In a telephone survey of the American public, 79 percent disagreed with the verdict, 81 percent believed that the life sentence Calley had received was too stern, and 69 percent believed Calley had been made a scapegoat.[15]\\r\\nMany others were outraged not at Calley's guilty verdict, but that he was the only one within the chain of command who was convicted. At the Winter Soldier Investigation in Detroit organized by Vietnam Veterans Against the War January 31ÿFebruary 2, 1971, veterans expressed their outrage, including 1st Lt. William Crandell of the 199th Light Infantry Brigade, Americal Division:[16]\\r\\nWe intend to tell who it was that gave us those orders; that created that policy; that set that standard of war bordering on full and final genocide. We intend to demonstrate that My Lai was no unusual occurrence, other than, perhaps, the number of victims killed all in one place, all at one time, all by one platoon of us. We intend to show that the policies of Americal Division, which inevitably resulted in My Lai, were the policies of other Army and Marine divisions as well. We intend to show that war crimes in Vietnam did not start in March 1968, or in the village of Son My or with one Lieutenant William Calley. We intend to indict those really responsible for My Lai, for Vietnam, for attempted genocide.\\r\\nIn a recollection of the Vietnam War, South Korean Vietnam Expeditionary Forces commanding officer Chae Myung Shin stated, \\"Calley tried to get revenge for the deaths of his troops. In a war, this is natural.\\"[17] Conversely, Colonel Harry G. Summers Jr. declared that Calley and Medina should have been hanged, drawn, and quartered, with their remains placed \\"at the gates of Fort Benning, at the Infantry School, as a reminder to those who pass under it of what an infantry officer ought to be.\\"[18]\\r\\nOn April 1, 1971, only a day after Calley was sentenced in prison at Fort Leavenworth, President Richard Nixon ordered him transferred from Leavenworth prison to house arrest at Fort Benning, pending appeal.[19]\\r\\nCalley served only three and a half years of house arrest in his quarters at Fort Benning. He petitioned the federal district court for habeas corpus on February 11, 1974, which was granted on September 25, 1974, along with his immediate release, by federal judge J. Robert Elliott. Judge Elliott determined that Calley's trial had been prejudiced by pre-trial publicity, denial of subpoenas of certain defense witnesses, refusal of the United States House of Representatives to release testimony taken in executive session of its My Lai investigation, and inadequate notice of the charges. The judge had released Calley on bail on February 27, 1974, but an appeals court reversed Elliott's ruling and returned Calley to U.S. Army custody on June 13, 1974. Consequently, his general court-martial conviction and dismissal from the U.S. Army were upheld; however, the prison sentence and subsequent parole obligations were commuted to time served, leaving Calley a free man.[8]\\r\\nIn 1975 Calley married Penny, with whom he has one son. The couple divorced in 2005 or 2006. He studied and became a gemologist, working at his father-in-law's jewelry store.[20]\\r\\nOn August 19, 2009, while speaking to the Kiwanis Club of Greater Columbus, Calley issued an apology for his role in the My Lai massacre. Calley said:\\r\\n\\"There is not a day that goes by that I do not feel remorse for what happened that day in My Lai. I feel remorse for the Vietnamese who were killed, for their families, for the American soldiers involved and their families. I am very sorry... If you are asking why I did not stand up to them when I was given the orders, I will have to say that I was a 2nd Lieutenant getting orders from my commander and I followed themfoolishly, I guess.\\"[21]","input":"Who was charged in the my lai massacre?"},{"output":"on an island near Australia","context":"\\r\\nKensuke's Kingdom is a children's novel by Michael Morpurgo, illustrated by Michael Foreman. It was first published in 1999[1] by Egmont UK. Since then, many more editions have been released by various other publishers, such as Scholastic.[2].\\r\\nA young boy called Michael travels with his parents around the world on the yacht Peggy Sue after his parents lose their jobs at the brickworks and decide to sail the seven seas. Michael's parents teach him what he would have normally learnt at school and he has a log that he writes in. They travel from England to Africa, South America and Australia.\\r\\nHe was on the lookout one night with his sheepdog, Stella Artois, and they awake to discover that they were on an island near Australia. While Michael struggles to survive on the island, food is regularly left for him. To his surprise, he learns that an elderly Japanese man called Kensuke is also living on the island. Kensuke helps Michael to survive. Kensuke was the one who saved Michael when Michael was thrown overboard.\\r\\nMichael teaches Kensuke English, and Kensuke teaches Michael how to paint, how to fish with a spear and where to find the best food (Such as red bananas) and water. He is eventually revealed to be a doctor and survivor of World War II, and he believes that his family, including his wife Kimi, and son Michaya, died in Nagasaki after the atomic bomb was dropped there on 9 August 1945. Over time Kensuke begins to understand how Michael feels and how he misses his family.\\r\\nTogether they build a beacon that can be lit to signal to ships, but for a long time they see no sign of any ships. Later, however, Michael witnesses a junk and he consults Kensuke as to whether or not he should light the beacon. Kensuke recognises the ship as that of poachers, and he and Michael rush to gather all the orangutans into the cave to protect them from the threat that lies in the ship. They nearly succeed but cannot find one particular orang-utan, the one Kensuke calls Kikanbo. The ship arrives and they hear gunshots. When the ship leaves, they discover that some gibbon monkeys have been killed, but that Kikanbo had survived.\\r\\nThe next time they see a ship it is not the poachers, and they both light the fire. The crew on the ship see the fire and change direction, heading towards the island. When the boat is closer, Michael sees that the boat is the Peggy Sue, with his parents on board. Kensuke decides at that point, despite thinking otherwise earlier, that he will not be sailing home with Michael; he says \\"This is my place. This Kensuke's Kingdom. Emperor must stay in his Kingdom, look after his people. Emperor does not run away. Not honourable thing to do.\\"\\r\\nKensuke tells him to keep everything a secret until ten years have passed, when Kensuke passes away. Michael runs out to the beach where the ship had landed and is reunited with his parents. In the postscript, it is revealed that 4 years after the book was published, Kensuke's son in the novel, Michaya, had survived and wrote to Michael asking to talk about Kensuke. Michael notes that he laughs just like his father.","input":"Where did michael live in kensuke's kingdom?"},{"output":"\\"Little Boy\\"","context":"\\"Little Boy\\" was the codename for the atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 during World War II by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay, piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, Jr., commander of the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces. It was the first atomic bomb to be used in warfare. The Hiroshima bombing was the second artificial nuclear explosion in history, after the Trinity test, and the first uranium-based detonation. It exploded with an energy of approximately 15 kilotons of TNT (63?TJ). The bomb caused significant destruction to the city of Hiroshima and its occupants.\\r\\nLittle Boy was developed by Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch's group of Captain William S. Parsons's Ordnance (O) Division at the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. Parsons flew on the Hiroshima mission as weaponeer. The Little Boy was a development of the unsuccessful Thin Man nuclear bomb. Like Thin Man, it was a gun-type fission weapon, but derived its explosive power from the nuclear fission of uranium-235, whereas Thin Man was based on fission of plutonium-239. Fission was accomplished by shooting a hollow cylinder of enriched uranium (the \\"bullet\\") onto a solid cylinder of the same material (the \\"target\\") by means of a charge of nitrocellulose propellant powder. It contained 64?kg (141?lb) of enriched uranium, of which less than a kilogram underwent nuclear fission. Its components were fabricated at three different plants so that no one would have a copy of the complete design.\\r\\nAfter the war ended, it was not expected that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed, but by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect, so six Little Boy assemblies were produced at Sandia Base. The Navy Bureau of Ordnance built another 25 Little Boy assemblies in 1947 for use by the Lockheed P2V Neptune nuclear strike aircraft (which could be launched from, but not land on, the Midway-class aircraft carriers). All the Little Boy units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe names for all three atomic bomb design projects during World War IIFat Man, Thin Man, and Little Boywere created by Robert Serber, a former student of Los Alamos Laboratory director Robert Oppenheimer who worked on the Manhattan Project. According to Serber, he chose them based on their design shapes. The \\"Thin Man\\" was a long device, and its name came from the Dashiell Hammett detective novel and series of movies of the same name. The \\"Fat Man\\" was round and fat, and was named after Kasper Gutman, Sydney Greenstreet's character in The Maltese Falcon. Little Boy came last, and was named after Elisha Cook, Jr.'s character in the same film, as referred to by Humphrey Bogart.[1]\\r\\nBecause uranium-235 was known to be fissionable, it was the first material pursued in the approach to bomb development. As the first design developed (as well as the first deployed for combat), it is sometimes known as the Mark I.[2] The vast majority of the work came in the form of the isotope enrichment of the uranium necessary for the weapon, since uranium-235 makes up only 1 part in 140 of natural uranium.[3] Enrichment was performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the electromagnetic separation plant, known as Y-12, became fully operational in March 1944.[4] The first shipments of highly enriched uranium were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory in June 1944.[5]\\r\\nMost of the uranium necessary for the production of the bomb came from the Shinkolobwe mine and was made available thanks to the foresight of the CEO of the High Katanga Mining Union, Edgar Sengier, who had 1,000 long tons (1,000?t) of uranium ore transported to a New York warehouse in 1939.[6] At least part of the 1,200 long tons (1,200?t) of uranium ore and uranium oxide captured by the Alsos Mission in 1944 and 1945 was used in the bomb.[7]\\r\\nLittle Boy was a simplification of Thin Man, the previous gun-type fission weapon design. Thin Man, 17 feet (5.2?m) long, was designed to use plutonium, so it was also more than capable of using enriched uranium. The Thin Man design was abandoned after experiments by Emilio G. Segr and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on the newly reactor-produced plutonium from Oak Ridge and the Hanford site showed that it contained impurities in the form of the isotope plutonium-240. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate and radioactivity than the cyclotron-produced plutonium on which the original measurements had been made, and its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium (needed for bomb making due to the quantities required) appeared unavoidable. This meant that the background fission rate of the plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely the plutonium would predetonate and blow itself apart in the initial forming of a critical mass.[8]\\r\\nIn July 1944, almost all research at Los Alamos was redirected to the implosion-type plutonium weapon. Overall responsibility for the uranium gun-type weapon was assigned to Captain William S. Parsons's Ordnance (O) Division. All the design, development, and technical work at Los Alamos was consolidated under Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch's group.[9]\\r\\nIn contrast to the plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon and the plutonium gun-type fission weapon, the uranium gun-type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design. The concept was pursued so that in case of a failure to develop a plutonium bomb, it would still be possible to use the gun principle. The gun-type design henceforth had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted. The simplified weapon was short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay.[10]\\r\\nThe design specifications were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let to build the components. Three different plants were used so that no one would have a copy of the complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line, Michigan; and the tail fairing and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit, Michigan.[11] The bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945.[12] The uranium-235 projectile was completed on 15 June, and the target on 24 July.[13] The target and bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on 16 July aboard the heavy cruiser USS?Indianapolis, arriving on 26 July.[14] The target inserts followed by air on 30 July.[13]\\r\\nAlthough all of its components had been tested,[13] no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before the Little Boy was dropped over Hiroshima. The only test explosion of a nuclear weapon concept had been of an implosion-type device employing plutonium as its fissile material, and took place on 16 July 1945 at the Trinity nuclear test. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was little uranium-235 as compared with the relatively large amount of plutonium which, it was expected, could be produced by the Hanford Site reactors.[15] Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough that it was only deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work.[16]\\r\\nThe danger of accidental detonation made safety a concern. Little Boy incorporated basic safety mechanisms, but an accidental detonation could still occur. Tests were conducted to see whether a crash could drive the hollow \\"bullet\\" onto the \\"target\\" cylinder resulting in a massive release of radiation, or possibly nuclear detonation. These showed that this required an impact of 500 times the force of gravity, which made it highly unlikely.[17] There was still concern that a crash and a fire could trigger the explosives.[18] If immersed in water, the uranium halves were subject to a neutron moderator effect. While this would not have caused an explosion, it could have created widespread radioactive contamination. For this reason, pilots were advised to crash on land rather than at sea.[17]\\r\\nThe Little Boy was 120 inches (300?cm) in length, 28 inches (71?cm) in diameter and weighed approximately 9,700 pounds (4,400?kg).[19] The design used the gun method to explosively force a hollow sub-critical mass of uranium-235 and a solid target cylinder together into a super-critical mass, initiating a nuclear chain reaction. This was accomplished by shooting one piece of the uranium onto the other by means of four cylindrical silk bags of cordite. The bomb contained 64?kg (141?lb) of enriched uranium. Most was enriched to 89% but some was only 50% uranium-235, for an average enrichment of 80%.[20] Less than a kilogram of uranium underwent nuclear fission, and of this mass only 0.6?g (0.021?oz) was transformed into several forms of energy, mostly kinetic energy, but also heat and radiation.[21]\\r\\nInside the weapon, the uranium-235 material was divided into two parts, following the gun principle: the \\"projectile\\" and the \\"target\\". The projectile was a hollow cylinder with 60% of the total mass (38.5?kg (85?lb)). It consisted of a stack of 9 uranium rings, each 6.25-inch (159?mm) in diameter with a 4-inch (100?mm) bore in the center, and a total length of 7 inches (180?mm), pressed together into the front end of a thin-walled projectile 16.25 inches (413?mm) long. Filling in the remainder of the space behind these rings in the projectile was a tungsten carbide disc with a steel back. At ignition, the projectile slug was pushed 42 inches (1,100?mm) along the 72-inch (1,800?mm) long, 6.5-inch (170?mm) smooth-bore gun barrel. The slug \\"insert\\" was a 4 inches (100?mm) cylinder, 7 inches (180?mm) in length with a 1 inch (25?mm) axial hole. The slug comprised 40% of the total fissile mass (25.6?kg or 56?lb). The insert was a stack of 6 washer-like uranium discs somewhat thicker than the projectile rings that were slid over a 1 inch (25?mm) rod. This rod then extended forward through the tungsten carbide tamper plug, impact-absorbing anvil, and nose plug backstop, eventually protruding out of the front of the bomb casing. This entire target assembly was secured at both ends with locknuts.[22][23]\\r\\nWhen the hollow-front projectile reached the target and slid over the target insert, the assembled super-critical mass of uranium would be completely surrounded by a tamper and neutron reflector of tungsten carbide and steel, both materials having a combined mass of 2,300?kg (5,100?lb).[24] Neutron initiators at the base of the projectile were activated by the impact.[25]\\r\\nFor the first fifty years after 1945, every published description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired into the center of a larger, stationary target.[26] However, critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.\\r\\nA hole in the center of the larger piece dispersed the mass and increased the surface area, allowing more fission neutrons to escape, thus preventing a premature chain reaction.[27] But, for this larger, hollow piece to have minimal contact with the tamper, it must be the projectile, since only the projectile's back end was in contact with the tamper prior to detonation. The rest of the tungsten carbide surrounded the sub-critical mass target cylinder (called the \\"insert\\" by the designers) with air space between it and the insert. This arrangement packs the maximum amount of fissile material into a gun-assembly design.[27]\\r\\nThe bomb employed a fusing system that was designed to detonate the bomb at the most destructive altitude. Calculations showed that for the largest destructive effect, the bomb should explode at an altitude of 580 metres (1,900?ft). The resultant fuze design was a three-stage interlock system:[28]\\r\\nThe Little Boy pre-assemblies were designated L-1, L-2, L-3, L-4, L-5, L-6, L-7, and L-11. L-1, L-2, L-5, and L-6 were expended in test drops. The first drop test was conducted with L-1 on 23 July 1945. It was dropped over the sea near Tinian in order to test the radar altimeter by the B-29 later known as Big Stink, piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, the commander of the 509th Composite Group. Two more drop tests over the sea were made on 24 and 25 July, using the L-2 and L-5 units in order to test all components. Tibbets was the pilot for both missions, but this time the bomber used was the one subsequently known as Jabit. L-6 was used as a dress rehearsal on 29 July. The B-29 Next Objective, piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney, flew to Iwo Jima, where emergency procedures for loading the bomb onto a standby aircraft were practiced. This rehearsal was repeated on 31 July, but this time L-6 was reloaded onto a different B-29, Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, and the bomb was test dropped near Tinian. L-11 was the assembly used for the Hiroshima bomb.[29][30]\\r\\nParsons, the Enola Gay's weaponeer, was concerned about the possibility of an accidental detonation if the plane crashed on takeoff, so he decided not to load the four cordite powder bags into the gun breech until the aircraft was in flight. Parsons and his assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, made their way into the bomb bay along the narrow catwalk on the port side. Jeppson held a flashlight while Parsons disconnected the primer wires, removed the breech plug, inserted the powder bags, replaced the breech plug, and reconnected the wires. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red. The bomb was then fully armed. Jeppson monitored the bomb's circuits.[31]\\r\\nThe bomb was dropped at approximately 08:15? (JST) 6 August 1945. After falling for 44.4 seconds, the time and barometric triggers started the firing mechanism. The detonation happened at an altitude of 1,968?I?50 feet (600?I?15?m). It was less powerful than the Fat Man, which was dropped on Nagasaki, but the damage and the number of victims at Hiroshima were much higher, as Hiroshima was on flat terrain, while the hypocenter of Nagasaki lay in a small valley. According to figures published in 1945, 66,000 people were killed as a direct result of the Hiroshima blast, and 69,000 were injured to varying degrees.[32] Of those deaths, 20,000 were members of the Imperial Japanese Army.[33]\\r\\nThe exact measurement of the yield was problematic, since the weapon had never been tested. President Harry S. Truman officially announced that the yield was 20 kilotons of TNT (84?TJ). This was based on Parsons's visual assessment that the blast was greater than what he had seen at the Trinity nuclear test. Since that had been estimated at 18 kilotons of TNT (75?TJ), speech writers rounded up to 20 kilotons. Further discussion was then suppressed, for fear of lessening the impact of the bomb on the Japanese. Data had been collected by Luis Alvarez, Harold Agnew, and Lawrence H. Johnston on the instrument plane, The Great Artiste, but this was not used to calculate the yield at the time.[34]\\r\\nAfter hostilities ended, a survey team from the Manhattan Project that included William Penney, Robert Serber, and George T. Reynolds was sent to Hiroshima to evaluate the effects of the blast. From evaluating the effects on objects and structures, Penney concluded that the yield was 12 I 1 kilotons.[35] Later calculations based on charring pointed to a yield of 13 to 14 kilotons.[36] In 1953, Frederick Reines calculated the yield as 13 kilotons.[34] This figure became the official yield.[37]\\r\\nIn 1962, scientists at Los Alamos created a mockup of Little Boy known as \\"Project Ichiban\\" in order to answer some of the unanswered questions, but it failed to clear up all the issues. In 1982, Los Alamos created a replica Little Boy from the original drawings and specifications. This was then tested with enriched uranium but in a safe configuration that would not cause a nuclear explosion. A hydraulic lift was used to move the projectile, and experiments were run to assess neutron emission.[38] Based on this and the data from The Great Artiste, the yield was estimated at 16.6 I 0.3 kilotons.[39] After considering many estimation methods, a 1985 report concluded that the yield was 15 kilotons I 20%.[37]\\r\\nWhen 1 pound (0.45?kg) of uranium-235 undergoes complete fission, the yield is 8 kilotons. The 16 kiloton yield of the Little Boy bomb was therefore produced by the fission of 2 pounds (0.91?kg) of uranium-235, out of the 141 pounds (64?kg) in the pit. The remaining 139 pounds (63?kg), 98.5% of the total, contributed nothing to the energy yield.[40]\\r\\nAfter being selected in April 1945, Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing to serve as a pristine target, where the effects of a nuclear bomb on an undamaged city could be observed.[41] While damage could be studied later, the energy yield of the untested Little Boy design could be determined only at the moment of detonation, using instruments dropped by parachute from a plane flying in formation with the one that dropped the bomb. Radio-transmitted data from these instruments indicated a yield of about 15 kilotons.[37]\\r\\nComparing this yield to the observed damage produced a rule of thumb called the 5 psi lethal area rule. Approximately 100% of people inside the area where the shock wave carries an overpressure of 5 psi or greater would be killed.[42] At Hiroshima, that area was 3.5 kilometres (2.2?mi) in diameter.[43]\\r\\nThe damage came from three main effects: blast, fire, and radiation.[44]\\r\\nThe blast from a nuclear bomb is the result of X-ray-heated air (the fireball) sending a shock wave or pressure wave in all directions, initially at a velocity greater than the speed of sound,[45] analogous to thunder generated by lightning. Knowledge about urban blast destruction is based largely on studies of Little Boy at Hiroshima. Nagasaki buildings suffered similar damage at similar distances, but the Nagasaki bomb detonated 3.2 kilometres (2.0?mi) from the city center over hilly terrain that was partially bare of buildings.[46]\\r\\nIn Hiroshima almost everything within 1.6 kilometres (1.0?mi) of the point directly under the explosion was completely destroyed, except for about 50 heavily reinforced, earthquake-resistant concrete buildings, only the shells of which remained standing. Most were completely gutted, with their windows, doors, sashes, and frames ripped out.[47] The perimeter of severe blast damage approximately followed the 5?psi (34?kPa) contour at 1.8 kilometres (1.1?mi).\\r\\nLater test explosions of nuclear weapons with houses and other test structures nearby confirmed the 5 psi overpressure threshold. Ordinary urban buildings experiencing it will be crushed, toppled, or gutted by the force of air pressure. The picture at right shows the effects of a nuclear-bomb-generated 5 psi pressure wave on a test structure in Nevada in 1953.[48]\\r\\nA major effect of this kind of structural damage was that it created fuel for fires that were started simultaneously throughout the severe destruction region.\\r\\nThe first effect of the explosion was blinding light, accompanied by radiant heat from the fireball. The Hiroshima fireball was 370 metres (1,200?ft) in diameter, with a surface temperature of 6,000?C (10,830?F).[49] Near ground zero, everything flammable burst into flame. One famous, anonymous Hiroshima victim, sitting on stone steps 260 metres (850?ft) from the hypocenter, left only a shadow, having absorbed the fireball heat that permanently bleached the surrounding stone.[50] Simultaneous fires were started throughout the blast-damaged area by fireball heat and by overturned stoves and furnaces, electrical shorts, etc. Twenty minutes after the detonation, these fires had merged into a firestorm, pulling in surface air from all directions to feed an inferno which consumed everything flammable.[51]\\r\\nThe Hiroshima firestorm was roughly 3.2 kilometres (2.0?mi) in diameter, corresponding closely to the severe blast damage zone. (See the USSBS[52] map, right.) Blast-damaged buildings provided fuel for the fire. Structural lumber and furniture were splintered and scattered about. Debris-choked roads obstructed fire fighters. Broken gas pipes fueled the fire, and broken water pipes rendered hydrants useless.[51] At Nagasaki, the fires failed to merge into a single firestorm, and the fire-damaged area was only one fourth as great as at Hiroshima, due in part to a southwest wind that pushed the fires away from the city.[53]\\r\\nAs the map shows, the Hiroshima firestorm jumped natural firebreaks (river channels), as well as prepared firebreaks. The spread of fire stopped only when it reached the edge of the blast-damaged area, encountering less available fuel.[54]\\r\\nAccurate casualty figures are impossible to determine, because many victims were cremated by the firestorm, along with all record of their existence. The Manhattan Project report on Hiroshima estimated that 60% of immediate deaths were caused by fire, but with the caveat that \\"many persons near the center of explosion suffered fatal injuries from more than one of the bomb effects.\\"[55] In particular, many fire victims also received lethal doses of nuclear radiation.\\r\\nLocal fallout is dust and ash from a bomb crater, contaminated with radioactive fission products. It falls to earth downwind of the crater and can produce, with radiation alone, a lethal area much larger than that from blast and fire. With an air burst, the fission products rise into the stratosphere, where they dissipate and become part of the global environment. Because Little Boy was an air burst 580 metres (1,900?ft) above the ground, there was no bomb crater and no local radioactive fallout.[56]\\r\\nHowever, a burst of intense neutron and gamma radiation came directly from the fireball. Its lethal radius was 1.3 kilometres (0.8?mi),[43] covering about half of the firestorm area. An estimated 30% of immediate fatalities were people who received lethal doses of this direct radiation, but died in the firestorm before their radiation injuries would have become apparent. Over 6,000 people survived the blast and fire, but died of radiation injuries.[55] Among injured survivors, 30% had radiation injuries[57] from which they recovered, but with a lifelong increase in cancer risk.[58] To date, no radiation-related evidence of heritable diseases has been observed among the survivors' children.[59][60][61]\\r\\nAlthough Little Boy exploded with the energy equivalent of 16,000 tons of TNT, the Strategic Bombing Survey estimated that the same blast and fire effect could have been caused by 2,100 tons of conventional bombs: \\"220 B-29s carrying 1,200 tons of incendiary bombs, 400 tons of high-explosive bombs, and 500 tons of anti-personnel fragmentation bombs.\\"[62] Since the target was spread across a two-dimensional plane, the vertical component of a single spherical nuclear explosion was largely wasted. A cluster bomb pattern of smaller explosions would have been a more energy-efficient match to the target.[62]\\r\\nWhen the war ended, it was not expected that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed. However, by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect. Faced with the prospect of no more plutonium for new cores and no more polonium for the initiators for the cores that had already been produced, Groves ordered that a number of Little Boys be prepared as an interim measure until a cure could be found. No Little Boy assemblies were available, and no comprehensive set of diagrams of the Little Boy could be found, although there were drawings of the various components, and stocks of spare parts.[63][64]\\r\\nAt Sandia Base, three Army officers, Captains Albert Bethel, Richard Meyer, and Bobbie Griffin attempted to re-create the Little Boy. They were supervised by Harlow W. Russ, an expert on Little Boy who served with Project Alberta on Tinian, and was now leader of the Z-11 Group of the Los Alamos Laboratory's Z Division at Sandia. Gradually, they managed to locate the correct drawings and parts, and figured out how they went together. Eventually, they built six Little Boy assemblies. Although the casings, barrels, and components were tested, no enriched uranium was supplied for the bombs. By early 1947, the problem caused by the Wigner effect was on its way to solution, and the three officers were reassigned.[63][64]\\r\\nThe Navy Bureau of Ordnance built 25 Little Boy assemblies in 1947 for use by the nuclear-capable Lockheed P2V Neptune aircraft carrier aircraft (which could be launched from but not land on the Midway-class aircraft carriers). Components were produced by the Naval Ordnance Plants in Pocatello, Idaho, and Louisville, Kentucky. Enough fissionable material was available by 1948 to build ten projectiles and targets, although there were only enough initiators for six.[65] All the Little Boy units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951.[66][67]\\r\\nThe Smithsonian Institution displayed a Little Boy (complete, except for enriched uranium), until 1986. The Department of Energy took the weapon from the museum to remove its inner components, so the bombs could not be stolen and detonated with fissile material. The government returned the emptied casing to the Smithsonian in 1993. Three other disarmed bombs are on display in the United States; another is at the Imperial War Museum in London.[26]","input":"What was the name of the hiroshima bomb?"},{"output":"single positively charged proton and a single negatively charged electron bound to the nucleus by the Coulomb force","context":"Hydrogen atom\\r\\nA hydrogen atom is an atom of the chemical element hydrogen. The electrically neutral atom contains a single positively charged proton and a single negatively charged electron bound to the nucleus by the Coulomb force. Atomic hydrogen constitutes about 75% of the baryonic mass of the universe.[1]\\r\\nIn everyday life on Earth, isolated hydrogen atoms (called \\"atomic hydrogen\\") are extremely rare. Instead, hydrogen tends to combine with other atoms in compounds, or with itself to form ordinary (diatomic) hydrogen gas, H2. \\"Atomic hydrogen\\" and \\"hydrogen atom\\" in ordinary English use have overlapping, yet distinct, meanings. For example, a water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms, but does not contain atomic hydrogen (which would refer to isolated hydrogen atoms).\\r\\nAttempts to develop a theoretical understanding of the hydrogen atom have been important to the history of quantum mechanics.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most abundant isotope, hydrogen-1, protium, or light hydrogen, contains no neutrons and is simply a proton and an electron. Protium is stable and makes up 99.9885% of naturally occurring hydrogen atoms.\\r\\nDeuterium contains one neutron and one proton. Deuterium is stable and makes up 0.0115% of naturally occurring hydrogen and is used in industrial processes like nuclear reactors and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.\\r\\nTritium contains two neutrons and one proton and is not stable, decaying with a half-life of 12.32 years. Because of the short half life, tritium does not exist in nature except in trace amounts.\\r\\nHigher isotopes of hydrogen are only created in artificial accelerators and reactors and have half lives around the order of 10?22 seconds.\\r\\nThe formulas below are valid for all three isotopes of hydrogen, but slightly different values of the Rydberg constant (correction formula given below) must be used for each hydrogen isotope.\\r\\nHydrogen is not found without its electron in ordinary chemistry (room temperatures and pressures), as ionized hydrogen is highly chemically reactive. When ionized hydrogen is written as \\"H+\\" as in the solvation of classical acids such as hydrochloric acid, the hydronium ion, H3O+, is meant, not a literal ionized single hydrogen atom. In that case, the acid transfers the proton to H2O to form H3O+.\\r\\nIonized hydrogen without its electron, or free protons, are common in the interstellar medium, and solar wind.\\r\\nThe hydrogen atom has special significance in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory as a simple two-body problem physical system which has yielded many simple analytical solutions in closed-form.\\r\\nExperiments by Ernest Rutherford in 1909 showed the structure of the atom to be a dense, positive nucleus with a light, negative charge orbiting around it. This immediately caused problems on how such a system could be stable. Classical electromagnetism had shown that any accelerating charge radiates energy described through the Larmor formula. If the electron is assumed to orbit in a perfect circle and radiates energy continuously, the electron would rapidly spiral into the nucleus with a fall time of:[2]\\r\\nWhere \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\na\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle a_{0}}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the Bohr radius and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle r_{0}}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the classical electron radius. If this were true, all atoms would instantly collapse, however atoms seem to be stable. Furthermore, the spiral inward would release a smear of electromagnetic frequencies as the orbit got smaller. Instead, atoms were observed to only emit discrete frequencies of radiation. The resolution would lie in the development of quantum mechanics.\\r\\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr obtained the energy levels and spectral frequencies of the hydrogen atom after making a number of simple assumptions in order to correct the failed classical model.

For hydrogen-1, hydrogen-2 (deuterium), and hydrogen-3 (tritium) the constant must be slightly modified to use the reduced mass of the system, rather than simply the mass of the electron.

For deuterium and tritium, the ratios are about 1/3670 and 1/5497 respectively. These figures, when added to 1 in the denominator, represent very small corrections in the value of R, and thus only small corrections to all energy levels in corresponding hydrogen isotopes.\\r\\nThere were still problems with Bohr's model:\\r\\nMost of these shortcomings were repaired by Arnold Sommerfeld's modification of the Bohr model. Sommerfeld introduced two additional degrees of freedom allowing an electron to move on an elliptical orbit, characterized by its eccentricity and declination with respect to a chosen axis. This introduces two additional quantum numbers, which correspond to the orbital angular momentum and its projection on the chosen axis. Thus the correct multiplicity of states (except for the factor 2 accounting for the yet unknown electron spin) was found. Further applying special relativity theory to the elliptic orbits, Sommerfeld succeeded in deriving the correct expression for the fine structure of hydrogen spectra (which happens to be exactly the same as in the most elaborate Dirac theory). However some observed phenomena such as the anomalous Zeeman effect remain unexplained. These issues were resolved with the full development of quantum mechanics and the Dirac equation. It is often alleged, that the Schr?dinger equation is superior to the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory in describing hydrogen atom. This is however not the case, as the most results of both approaches coincide or are very close (a remarkable exception is the problem of hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields, which cannot be solved in the framework of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory self-consistently), and their main shortcomings result from the absence of the electron spin in both theories. It was the complete failure of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory to explain many-electron systems (such as helium atom or hydrogen molecule) which demonstrated its inadequacy in describing quantum phenomena.\\r\\nThe Schr?dinger equation allows one to calculate the development of quantum systems with time and can give exact, analytical answers for the non-relativistic hydrogen atom.\\r\\nThe Hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom is the radial kinetic energy operator and coulomb attraction force between the positive proton and negative electron.

It also yields two other quantum numbers and the shape of the electron's wave function (\\"orbital\\") for the various possible quantum-mechanical states, thus explaining the anisotropic character of atomic bonds.\\r\\nThe Schr?dinger equation also applies to more complicated atoms and molecules. When there is more than one electron or nucleus the solution is not analytical and either computer calculations are necessary or simplifying assumptions must be made.\\r\\nSince the Schr?dinger equation is only valid for non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the solutions it yields for the hydrogen atom are not entirely correct. The Dirac equation of relativistic quantum theory improves these solutions (see below).\\r\\nThe solution of the Schr?dinger equation (wave equation) for the hydrogen atom uses the fact that the Coulomb potential produced by the nucleus is isotropic (it is radially symmetric in space and only depends on the distance to the nucleus). Although the resulting energy eigenfunctions (the orbitals) are not necessarily isotropic themselves, their dependence on the angular coordinates follows completely generally from this isotropy of the underlying potential: the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (that is, the energy eigenstates) can be chosen as simultaneous eigenstates of the angular momentum operator. This corresponds to the fact that angular momentum is conserved in the orbital motion of the electron around the nucleus. Therefore, the energy eigenstates may be classified by two angular momentum quantum numbers, ? and m (both are integers). The angular momentum quantum number ? = 0, 1, 2, ... determines the magnitude of the angular momentum. The magnetic quantum number m = ??, ..., +? determines the projection of the angular momentum on the (arbitrarily chosen) z-axis.\\r\\nIn addition to mathematical expressions for total angular momentum and angular momentum projection of wavefunctions, an expression for the radial dependence of the wave functions must be found. It is only here that the details of the 1/r Coulomb potential enter (leading to Laguerre polynomials in r). This leads to a third quantum number, the principal quantum number n = 1, 2, 3, .... The principal quantum number in hydrogen is related to the atom's total energy.\\r\\nNote that the maximum value of the angular momentum quantum number is limited by the principal quantum number: it can run only up to n ? 1, i.e. ? = 0, 1, ..., n ? 1.\\r\\nDue to angular momentum conservation, states of the same ? but different m have the same energy (this holds for all problems with rotational symmetry). In addition, for the hydrogen atom, states of the same n but different ? are also degenerate (i.e. they have the same energy). However, this is a specific property of hydrogen and is no longer true for more complicated atoms which have an (effective) potential differing from the form 1/r (due to the presence of the inner electrons shielding the nucleus potential).\\r\\nTaking into account the spin of the electron adds a last quantum number, the projection of the electron's spin angular momentum along the z-axis, which can take on two values. Therefore, any eigenstate of the electron in the hydrogen atom is described fully by four quantum numbers. According to the usual rules of quantum mechanics, the actual state of the electron may be any superposition of these states. This explains also why the choice of z-axis for the directional quantization of the angular momentum vector is immaterial: an orbital of given ? and m obtained for another preferred axis z can always be represented as a suitable superposition of the various states of different m (but same l) that have been obtained for z.\\r\\nIn 1928, Paul Dirac found an equation that was fully compatible with Special Relativity, and (as a consequence) made the wave function a 4-component \\"Dirac spinor\\" including \\"up\\" and \\"down\\" spin components, with both positive and \\"negative\\" energy (or matter and antimatter). The solution to this equation gave the following results, more accurate than the Schr?dinger solution.\\r\\nThe energy levels of hydrogen, including fine structure (excluding Lamb shift and hyperfine structure), are given by the Sommerfeld fine structure expression:[11]\\r\\nwhere ϫ is the fine-structure constant and j is the \\"total angular momentum\\" quantum number, which is equal to |? I 1/2| depending on the direction of the electron spin. This formula represents a small correction to the energy obtained by Bohr and Schr?dinger as given above. The factor in square brackets in the last expression is nearly one; the extra term arises from relativistic effects (for details, see #Features going beyond the Schr?dinger solution). It is worth noting that this expression was first obtained by A. Sommerfeld in 1916 based on the relativistic version of the old Bohr theory. Sommerfeld has however used different notation for the quantum numbers.\\r\\nThe image to the right shows the first few hydrogen atom orbitals (energy eigenfunctions). These are cross-sections of the probability density that are color-coded (black represents zero density and white represents the highest density). The angular momentum (orbital) quantum number ? is denoted in each column, using the usual spectroscopic letter code (s means ??=?0, p means ??=?1, d means ??=?2). The main (principal) quantum number n (= 1, 2, 3, ...) is marked to the right of each row. For all pictures the magnetic quantum number m has been set to 0, and the cross-sectional plane is the xz-plane (z is the vertical axis). The probability density in three-dimensional space is obtained by rotating the one shown here around the z-axis.\\r\\nThe \\"ground state\\", i.e. the state of lowest energy, in which the electron is usually found, is the first one, the 1s state (principal quantum level n = 1, ? = 0).\\r\\nBlack lines occur in each but the first orbital: these are the nodes of the wavefunction, i.e. where the probability density is zero. (More precisely, the nodes are spherical harmonics that appear as a result of solving Schr?dinger equation in polar coordinates.)\\r\\nThe quantum numbers determine the layout of these nodes.[12] There are:\\r\\nThere are several important effects that are neglected by the Schr?dinger equation and which are responsible for certain small but measurable deviations of the real spectral lines from the predicted ones:\\r\\nBoth of these features (and more) are incorporated in the relativistic Dirac equation, with predictions that come still closer to experiment. Again the Dirac equation may be solved analytically in the special case of a two-body system, such as the hydrogen atom. The resulting solution quantum states now must be classified by the total angular momentum number j (arising through the coupling between electron spin and orbital angular momentum). States of the same j and the same n are still degenerate. Thus, direct analytical solution of Dirac equation predicts 2S(1/2) and 2P(1/2) levels of Hydrogen to have exactly the same energy, which is in a contradiction with observations (Lamb-Retherford experiment).\\r\\nFor these developments, it was essential that the solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom could be worked out exactly, such that any experimentally observed deviation had to be taken seriously as a signal of failure of the theory.\\r\\nIn the language of Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, the hydrogen atom was first solved by Wolfgang Pauli[13] using a rotational symmetry in four dimensions [O(4)-symmetry] generated by the angular momentum and the LaplaceÿRungeÿLenz vector. By extending the symmetry group O(4) to the dynamical group O(4,2), the entire spectrum and all transitions were embedded in a single irreducible group representation.[14]\\r\\nIn 1979 the (non relativistic) hydrogen atom was solved for the first time within Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics.[15][16] This work greatly extended the range of applicability of Feynman's method.","input":"What is the common makeup of a hydrogen atom?"},{"output":"Her Majesty's Prison Wakefield","context":"Her Majesty's Prison Wakefield is a Category A men's prison, located in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England. The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and is the largest high-security prison in the United Kingdom (and western Europe). The prison has been nicknamed the \\"Monster Mansion\\" due to the large number of high-profile, high-risk sex offenders and murderers held there.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWakefield Prison was originally built as a house of correction in 1594. Most of the current prison buildings date from Victorian times. The current prison was designated a Dispersal prison in 1966 and is the oldest of the Dispersal prisons still operating across England and Wales.\\r\\nThe English Dialect Dictionary noted references to Wakefield were often short for referring to the long-standing prison (e.g. \\"being sent to Wakefield\\" meant being sent to prison).[3]\\r\\nThe exercise yard at Wakefield has a mulberry tree, around which female inmates used to exercise. This has been linked to the nursery rhyme \\"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush\\" by the erstwhile prison governor, RS Duncan in his book 'Here we go round the mulberry bush': The House of Correction 1595 / HM Prison Wakefield 1995 (published by author 1994). This origin of the song is also propounded on the prison's website. There is no corroborative evidence to support this theory.[4]\\r\\nDuring the First World War, Wakefield Prison was used as a Home Office work camp. The ordinary criminal prisoners were removed, and the new influx were sentenced to two or more years' imprisonment for refusing to obey military orders.[5] After the closure of Dyce prison camp in October 1916, Wakefield Prison was also used to intern conscientious objectors.[6] In September 1918 a group of conscientious objectors took advantage of a slackening in the prison regime that occurred towards the end of the war, by rebelling and refusing to undertake any work.[6] They issued a list of demands for better treatment, known as the Wakefield Manifesto.[6]\\r\\nAs a high-security prison, Wakefield was used to house IRA prisoners at various points in the 20th century. In some cases in the 1950s, the IRA attempted to free the prisoners, such as Cathal Goulding in 1956 (the attempt was aborted when the sirens sounded)[7] and James Andrew Mary Murphy in 1959 (who was freed).[8] During a hunger strike by Provisional IRA prisoners, Frank Stagg died in Wakefield Prison on 12 February 1976.[9] The case brought international media attention as the British Government denied Stagg's last request for a military funeral march from Dublin to Ballina, and instead arranged for the police to bury him secretly.[10] On 1 March 1976, Merlyn Rees, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the Wilson ministry, announced that those people convicted of causing terrorist offences would no longer be entitled to Special Category Status, which was challenged during later hunger strikes.[11]\\r\\nIn 2001 it was announced that a new Supermax security unit was to be built at Wakefield Prison. The unit was to house the most dangerous inmates within the British prisons system, and was the first such unit of its kind to be built in the United Kingdom.[12]\\r\\nIn March 2004 an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised staff at Wakefield Prison for being disrespectful to inmates. The report claimed that the prison was \\"over-controlled\\", and a third of the prison's inmates claimed to have been victimised.[13]\\r\\nWakefield Prison holds approximately 600 of Britain's most dangerous people (mainly sex offenders and prisoners serving life sentences for violent crimes against women and children). Accommodation at the prison comprises single-occupancy cells with integral sanitation. All residential units have kitchens available for offenders to prepare their own meals. An Incentives and Earned Privileges system allows standard and enhanced offenders the opportunity of in-cell TV. All offenders are subject to mandatory drugs testing and there are voluntary testing arrangements, which are compulsory for all offenders employed as e.g. wing cleaners or kitchen workers.\\r\\nHMP Wakefield offers a range of activities for inmates, including charity work, an accredited course in industrial cleaning, and a Braille shop where offenders convert books to Braille. The Education Department is operated by The Manchester College, and offers learning opportunities ranging from basic skills to Open University courses. Other facilities include a prison shop, gym, and multi-faith chaplaincy.\\r\\nCoordinates: 534057N 13033W? / ?53.68250N 1.50917W? / 53.68250; -1.50917","input":"What is the highest security prison in the uk?"},{"output":"over 300","context":"Ion channels are pore-forming membrane proteins that allow ions to pass through the channel pore. Their functions include establishing a resting membrane potential, shaping action potentials and other electrical signals by gating the flow of ions across the cell membrane, controlling the flow of ions across secretory and epithelial cells, and regulating cell volume. Ion channels are present in the membranes of all excitable cells.[1] Ion channels are one of the two classes of ionophoric proteins, along with ion transporters (including the sodium-potassium pump, sodium-calcium exchanger, and sodium-glucose transport proteins).[2]\\r\\nThe study of ion channels often involves biophysics, electrophysiology, and pharmacology, while using techniques including voltage clamp, patch clamp, immunohistochemistry, X-ray crystallography, fluoroscopy, and RT-PCR. Their classification as molecules is referred to as channelomics.\\r\\nThere are two distinctive features of ion channels that differentiate them from other types of ion transporter proteins:[3]\\r\\nIon channels are located within the membrane of all excitable cells,[1] and of many intracellular organelles. They are often described as narrow, water-filled tunnels that allow only ions of a certain size and/or charge to pass through. This characteristic is called selective permeability. The archetypal channel pore is just one or two atoms wide at its narrowest point and is selective for specific species of ion, such as sodium or potassium. However, some channels may be permeable to the passage of more than one type of ion, typically sharing a common charge: positive (cations) or negative (anions). Ions often move through the segments of the channel pore in single file nearly as quickly as the ions move through free solution. In many ion channels, passage through the pore is governed by a \\"gate\\", which may be opened or closed in response to chemical or electrical signals, temperature, or mechanical force.\\r\\nIon channels are integral membrane proteins, typically formed as assemblies of several individual proteins. Such \\"multi-subunit\\" assemblies usually involve a circular arrangement of identical or homologous proteins closely packed around a water-filled pore through the plane of the membrane or lipid bilayer.[4][5] For most voltage-gated ion channels, the pore-forming subunit(s) are called the ϫ subunit, while the auxiliary subunits are denoted , , and so on.\\r\\nBecause channels underlie the nerve impulse and because \\"transmitter-activated\\" channels mediate conduction across the synapses, channels are especially prominent components of the nervous system. Indeed, numerous toxins that organisms have evolved for shutting down the nervous systems of predators and prey (e.g., the venoms produced by spiders, scorpions, snakes, fish, bees, sea snails, and others) work by modulating ion channel conductance and/or kinetics. In addition, ion channels are key components in a wide variety of biological processes that involve rapid changes in cells, such as cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle contraction, epithelial transport of nutrients and ions, T-cell activation and pancreatic beta-cell insulin release. In the search for new drugs, ion channels are a frequent target.[6][7][8]\\r\\nThere are over 300 types of ion channels just in the cells of the inner ear.[9] Ion channels may be classified by the nature of their gating, the species of ions passing through those gates, the number of gates (pores) and localization of proteins.\\r\\nFurther heterogeneity of ion channels arises when channels with different constitutive subunits give rise to a specific kind of current.[10] Absence or mutation of one or more of the contributing types of channel subunits can result in loss of function and, potentially, underlie neurologic diseases.\\r\\nIon channels may be classified by gating, i.e. what opens and closes the channels. Voltage-gated ion channels open or close depending on the voltage gradient across the plasma membrane, while ligand-gated ion channels open or close depending on binding of ligands to the channel.[citation needed]\\r\\nVoltage-gated ion channels open and close in response to membrane potential.\\r\\nAlso known as ionotropic receptors, this group of channels open in response to specific ligand molecules binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor protein. Ligand binding causes a conformational change in the structure of the channel protein that ultimately leads to the opening of the channel gate and subsequent ion flux across the plasma membrane. Examples of such channels include the cation-permeable \\"nicotinic\\" Acetylcholine receptor, ionotropic glutamate-gated receptors, acid sensing ion channels (ASICs),[11] ATP-gated P2X receptors, and the anion-permeable -aminobutyric acid-gated GABAA receptor.\\r\\nIon channels activated by second messengers may also be categorized in this group, although ligands and second messengers are otherwise distinguished from each other.\\r\\nGating also includes activation and inactivation by second messengers from the inside of the cell membrane ÿ rather than from outside the cell, as in the case for ligands.\\r\\nIon channels are also classified according to their subcellular localization. The plasma membrane accounts for around 2% of the total membrane in the cell, whereas intracellular organelles contain 98% of the cell's membrane. The major intracellular compartments are endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria. On the basis of localization, ion channels are classified as:\\r\\nThere are other criteria for ion channel classification, including multiple pores and transient potentials.\\r\\nAlmost all ion channels have a single pore. However, there are also those with two pores:\\r\\nThere are channels that are classified by the duration of the response to stimuli:\\r\\nChannels differ with respect to the ion they let pass (for example, Na+, K+, Cl?), the ways in which they may be regulated, the number of subunits of which they are composed and other aspects of structure.[13] Channels belonging to the largest class, which includes the voltage-gated channels that underlie the nerve impulse, consists of four subunits with six transmembrane helices each. On activation, these helices move about and open the pore. Two of these six helices are separated by a loop that lines the pore and is the primary determinant of ion selectivity and conductance in this channel class and some others. The existence and mechanism for ion selectivity was first postulated in the 1960s by Clay Armstrong.[14] He suggested that the pore lining could efficiently replace the water molecules that normally shield potassium ions, but that sodium ions were too small to allow such shielding, and therefore could not pass through. This mechanism was finally confirmed when the structure of the channel was elucidated. The channel subunits of one such other class, for example, consist of just this \\"P\\" loop and two transmembrane helices. The determination of their molecular structure by Roderick MacKinnon using X-ray crystallography won a share of the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\\r\\nBecause of their small size and the difficulty of crystallizing integral membrane proteins for X-ray analysis, it is only very recently that scientists have been able to directly examine what channels \\"look like.\\" Particularly in cases where the crystallography required removing channels from their membranes with detergent, many researchers regard images that have been obtained as tentative. An example is the long-awaited crystal structure of a voltage-gated potassium channel, which was reported in May 2003.[15][16] One inevitable ambiguity about these structures relates to the strong evidence that channels change conformation as they operate (they open and close, for example), such that the structure in the crystal could represent any one of these operational states. Most of what researchers have deduced about channel operation so far they have established through electrophysiology, biochemistry, gene sequence comparison and mutagenesis.\\r\\nChannels can have single (CLICs) to multiple transmembrane (K channels, P2X receptors, Na channels) domains which span plasma membrane to form pores. Pore can determine the selectivity of the channel. Gate can be formed either inside or outside the pore region.\\r\\nA variety of inorganic and organic molecules can modulate ion channel activity and conductance. Some commonly used blockers include:\\r\\nThere are a number of disorders which disrupt normal functioning of ion channels and have disastrous consequences for the organism. Genetic and autoimmune disorders of ion channels and their modifiers are known as channelopathies. See Category:Channelopathies for a full list.\\r\\nThe fundamental properties of currents mediated by ion channels were analyzed by the British biophysicists Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley as part of their Nobel Prize-winning research on the action potential, published in 1952. They built on the work of other physiologists, such as Cole and Baker's research into voltage-gated membrane pores from 1941.[18][19] The existence of ion channels was confirmed in the 1970s by Bernard Katz and Ricardo Miledi using noise analysis. It was then shown more directly with an electrical recording technique known as the \\"patch clamp\\", which led to a Nobel Prize to Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann, the technique's inventors. Hundreds if not thousands of researchers continue to pursue a more detailed understanding of how these proteins work. In recent years the development of automated patch clamp devices helped to increase significantly the throughput in ion channel screening.\\r\\nThe Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2003 was awarded to two American scientists: Roderick MacKinnon for his studies on the physico-chemical properties of ion channel structure and function, including x-ray crystallographic structure studies, and Peter Agre for his similar work on aquaporins.[20]\\r\\nRoderick MacKinnon commissioned Birth of an Idea, a 5-foot (1.5?m) tall sculpture based on the KcsA potassium channel.[21] The artwork contains a wire object representing the channel's interior with a blown glass object representing the main cavity of the channel structure.","input":"How many types of ion channels are there?"},{"output":"navigates waterborne vessels or assists as a crewmember in their operation and maintenance","context":"A sailor, seaman, mariner, or seafarer is a person who navigates waterborne vessels or assists as a crewmember in their operation and maintenance. The term bluejacket may be used for British or US Navy enlisted sailors, the latter especially when deployed ashore as infantry.[1] The Bluejacket's Manual is the basic handbook for United States Navy personnel. 700,000 of the world's mariners come from the Philippines, being the world's largest origin of seafarers.[2]\\r\\nEtymologically, the name \\"sailor\\" preserves the memory of the time when ships were commonly powered by sails, but it applies to the personnel of all vessels, whatever their mode of propulsion, and includes military (naval) and security (coast guard) maritime personnel and members of the merchant marine, as well as recreational sailors. The term \\"seaman\\" is frequently used in the particular sense of a sailor who is not an officer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSeafarers hold a variety of professions and ranks, each of which carries unique responsibilities which are integral to the successful operation of an ocean-going vessel. A ship's crew can generally be divided into four main categories: the deck department, the engineering department, the steward's department, and others.\\r\\nOfficer positions in the deck department include but are not limited to: master and his chief, second and third officers. The official classifications for unlicensed members of the deck department are able seaman and ordinary seaman. With some variation, the chief mate is most often charged with the duties of cargo mate. Second Mates are charged with being the medical officer in case of medical emergency. All three mates each do four-hour morning and afternoon shifts on the bridge, when underway at sea.\\r\\nA common deck crew for a ship includes:\\r\\nA ship's engineering department consists of the members of a ship's crew that operates and maintains the propulsion and other systems on board the vessel. Marine engineering staff also deal with the \\"hotel\\" facilities on board, notably the sewage, lighting, air conditioning and water systems. Engineering staff manage bulk fuel transfers, from a fuel-supply barge in port. When underway at sea, the second and third engineers will often be occupied with oil transfers from storage tanks, to active working tanks. Cleaning of oil purifiers is another regular task. Engineering staff are required to have training in firefighting and first aid. Additional duties include maintaining the ship's boats and performing other nautical tasks. Engineers play a key role in cargo loading/discharging gear and safety systems, though the specific cargo discharge function remains the responsibility of deck officers and deck workers.\\r\\nA common engineering crew for a ship includes:\\r\\nUSA ships also carry a qualified member of the engine department. Other possible positions include motorman, machinist, electrician, refrigeration engineer and tankerman.\\r\\nA typical steward's department for a cargo ship is a chief steward, a chief cook and a steward's assistant. All three positions are typically filled by unlicensed personnel.\\r\\nThe chief steward directs, instructs, and assigns personnel performing such functions as preparing and serving meals; cleaning and maintaining officers' quarters and steward department areas; and receiving, issuing, and inventorying stores.\\r\\nThe chief steward also plans menus; compiles supply, overtime, and cost control records. The steward may requisition or purchase stores and equipment. Galley roles may include baking.\\r\\nA chief steward's duties may overlap with those of the steward's assistant, the chief cook, and other Steward's department crewmembers.\\r\\nA person has to have a Merchant Mariner's Document issued by the United States Coast Guard in the United States Merchant Marine in order to serve as a chief steward. All chief cooks who sail internationally are similarly documented by their respective countries because of international conventions and agreements.\\r\\nThe only time that steward department staff are charged with duties outside the steward department, is during the execution of the fire and boat drill.\\r\\nVarious types of staff officer positions may exist on board a ship, including junior assistant purser, senior assistant purser, purser, chief purser, medical doctor, professional nurse, marine physician assistant and hospital corpsman. These jobs[3] are considered administrative positions and are therefore regulated by Certificates of Registry issued by the United States Coast Guard. Pilots are also merchant marine officers and are licensed by the Coast Guard.\\r\\nMariners spend extended periods at sea. Most deep-sea mariners are hired for one or more voyages that last for several months. There is no job security after that. The length of time between voyages varies by job availability and personal preference.[4]\\r\\nThe rate of unionization for these workers in the United States is about 36 percent, much higher than the average for all occupations. Consequently, merchant marine officers and seamen, both veterans and beginners, are hired for voyages through union hiring halls or directly by shipping companies. Hiring halls fill jobs by the length of time the person has been registered at the hall and by their union seniority. Hiring halls typically are found in major seaports.\\r\\nAt sea, on larger vessels members of the deck department usually stand watch for 4 hours and are off for 8 hours, 7 days a week.[a]\\r\\nMariners work in all weather conditions. Working in damp and cold conditions often is inevitable, although ships try to avoid severe storms while at sea. It is uncommon for modern vessels to suffer disasters such as fire, explosion, or a sinking. Yet workers face the possibility of having to abandon ship on short notice if it collides with other vessels or runs aground. Mariners also risk injury or death from falling overboard and from hazards associated with working with machinery, heavy loads, and dangerous cargo. However, modern safety management procedures, advanced emergency communications, and effective international rescue systems place modern mariners in a much safer position.\\r\\nMost newer vessels are air conditioned, soundproofed from noisy machinery, and equipped with comfortable living quarters. These amenities have helped ease the sometimes difficult circumstances of long periods away from home. Also, modern communications; email, instant messaging and social media platforms etc., link modern mariners to their families. Nevertheless, some mariners dislike the long periods away from home and the confinement aboard ship. They consequently leave the profession.\\r\\nProfessional mariners live on the margins of society, with much of their life spent beyond the reach of land. They face cramped, stark, noisy, and dangerous conditions at sea. Yet men and women still go to sea. For some, the attraction is a life unencumbered with the restraints of life ashore. Seagoing adventure and a chance to see the world also appeal to many seafarers. Whatever the calling, those who live and work at sea invariably confront social isolation.\\r\\nFindings by the Seafarer's International Research Center indicate a leading cause of mariners leaving the industry is \\"almost invariably because they want to be with their families\\". U.S. merchant ships typically do not allow family members to accompany seafarers on voyages. Industry experts increasingly recognize isolation, stress, and fatigue as occupational hazards. Advocacy groups such as International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency, and the Nautical Institute seek improved international standards for mariners.\\r\\nOnes service aboard ships typically extends for months at a time, followed by protracted shore leave. However, some seamen secure jobs on ships they like and stay aboard for years. In rare cases, veteran mariners choose never to go ashore when in port.\\r\\nFurther, the quick turnaround of many modern ships, spending only a matter of hours in port, limits a seafarer's free-time ashore. Moreover, some seafarers entering U.S. ports from a watch list of 25 countries deemed high-risk face restrictions on shore leave due to security concerns in a post 9/11 environment. However, shore leave restrictions while in U.S. ports impact American seamen as well. For example, the International Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots notes a trend of U.S. shipping terminal operators restricting seamen from traveling from the ship to the terminal gate. Further, in cases where transit is allowed, special \\"security fees\\" are at times assessed.\\r\\nSuch restrictions on shore leave coupled with reduced time in port by many ships translate into longer periods at sea. Mariners report that extended periods at sea living and working with shipmates who for the most part are strangers takes getting used to. At the same time, there is an opportunity to meet people from a wide range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Recreational opportunities have improved aboard some U.S. ships, which may feature gyms and day rooms for watching movies, swapping sea stories, and other activities. And in some cases, especially tankers, it is made possible for a mariner to be accompanied by members of his family. However, a mariners off duty time at sea is largely a solitary affair, pursuing hobbies, reading, writing letters, and sleeping.\\r\\nInternet accessibility is fast coming to the sea with the advent of cheap satellite communication, mainly from Inmarsat. The availability of affordable roaming sim cards with online top-up facilities have also contributed to improved connection with friends and family at home.\\r\\nErik the Red and his son Leif Erikson were the first notable mariners known to sail in a primitive, partly man powered vessel across the Arctic and the North Atlantic Ocean.\\r\\nBarbarossa Hayrettin Pasha (Turkish: Barbaros Hayrettin Pa?a or H?z?r Hayrettin Pa?a; also H?z?r Reis before being promoted to the rank of Pasha and becoming the Kaptan-? Derya (Fleet Admiral) of the Ottoman Navy) (c. 1478 ÿ 4 July 1546) was an Ottoman admiral who dominated the Mediterranean for decades. He was born on the island of Lesbos/ Mytilini and died in Istanbul, the Ottoman capital.\\r\\nMerchant seamen have gone on to make their mark on the world in a number of interesting ways. Traian B?sescu, who started his career as a third mate in 1976 is now the President of Romania. Arthur Phillip joined the Merchant Navy in 1751 and 37 years later founded the city of Sydney, Australia. Merchant mariner Douglass North went from seaman to navigator to winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize in Economics. Jimmy Carter went on to become the 39th President of the United States after service in the US Navy.\\r\\nMembers of the British Merchant Navy have won the Distinguished Service Cross and have had careers taking them from 'Deck Boy Peter' to Air Marshal Sir Beresford Peter Torrington Horsley KCB, CBE, LVO, AFC. Canadian merchant seamen have won the Victoria Cross and the Medal of Honor. American merchant seamen have won the Medal of Honor in the Korean War and Vietnam War, and one went on to become the \\"Father of the American Navy.\\" One doesn't have to look far to find merchant seamen who became war heroes in Scotland, France, New Zealand, Peru, or Denmark.\\r\\nSince World War II, a number of merchant seamen have become notorious criminals. American William Colepaugh was convicted as a Nazi spy in World War II and Fritz Sauckel was convicted as a Nazi war criminal. Briton Duncan Scott-Ford was hanged for treachery in World War II. George Hennard was an American mass murderer who claimed 24 victims on a rampage at Luby's Cafeteria in Killeen, Texas. And Perry Smith's own murderous rampage was made famous in Truman Capote's non-fiction novel In Cold Blood.\\r\\nMariners are well represented in the visual arts. French pilot's assistant Paul Gauguin later became a leading post-impressionist painter and pioneered modern art's synthetist style. American seaman Haskell Wexler later won two Academy Awards, the latter for a biography of his shipmate Woody Guthrie. British Merchant Navy member Ken Russell later directed films such as Tommy, Altered States and The Lair of the White Worm. Merchant seaman Johnny Craig was already a working comic book artist before he joined up, but Ernie Schroeder wouldn't start drawing comics until after returning home from World War II.\\r\\nMerchant sailors have also made a splash in the world of sport. In football, with Fred Blackburn in England and the likes of Dan Devine and Heisman Trophy winner Frank Sinkwich in the U.S. In track and field, American seamen Cornelius Johnson and Jim Thorpe both won Olympic medals, though Thorpe didn't get his until 30 years after his death. Seamen Jim Bagby, Jr. and Charlie Keller went on to Major League Baseball. Drew Bundini Brown was Muhammad Ali's assistant trainer and cornerman, and Joe Gold went on to make his fortune as the bodybuilding and fitness guru of Gold's Gym.\\r\\nOther sporting notables include Dutchman Henk de Velde known for sailing solo around the world, and Briton Matthew Webb who was the first person to swim the English Channel without the use of artificial aid.\\r\\nIrish Merchant Navy member Kevin McClory spent 14 days in a lifeboat and later went on to write the James Bond movies Never Say Never Again and Thunderball. Members of the American Beat Movement Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Bob Kaufman, and Herbert Huncke were all Merchant Mariners.\\r\\nIt is perhaps not surprising that the writers of Moby Dick, The American Practical Navigator, and Two Years Before the Mast were Merchant Mariners. It might be surprising that the writers of Borat, A Hard Day's Night, and Cool Hand Luke were.\\r\\nSeamen always complain about leaving their girl friends ashore, but imagine how James Dougherty felt, leaving his 17-year-old wife Marilyn Monroe on the beach. Merchant Navy steward Freddie Lennon had a surprise when he returned home to find he had a newborn son. That son later founded the musical group The Beatles.\\r\\nA number of U.S. Merchant Mariners from World War II later played well known television characters. The list includes Milburn Drysdale on The Beverly Hillbillies, Archie Bunker on All in the Family, Peter Falk on Columbo, Jim Rockford on The Rockford Files, Steve McGarret on Hawaii Five-O, Uncle Jesse Duke on The Dukes of Hazzard and Cheyenne Bodie on Cheyenne.\\r\\nAn ancient term, the word \\"sailor\\" has come to mean many things.

The result was Silent Spring (1962), which brought environmental concerns to the American public. Silent Spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, but it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, led to a nationwide ban on DDT for agricultural uses,[2] and inspired an environmental movement that led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.[3][4]\\r\\nIn 1996, a follow-up book, Beyond Silent Spring, co-written by H.F. van Emden and David Peakall, was published.[5][6] In 2006, Silent Spring was named one of the 25 greatest science books of all time by the editors of Discover Magazine.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mid-1940s, Carson became concerned about the use of synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the military funding of science after World War II. The United States Department of Agriculture's 1957 fire ant eradication program, which involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides mixed with fuel oil and included the spraying of private land, prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons.[8][9] Landowners in Long Island filed a suit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely.[3] Though the suit was lost, the Supreme Court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future, laying the basis for later environmental actions.[3][10][11]\\r\\nThe impetus for Silent Spring was a letter written in January 1958 by Carson's friend, Olga Owens Huckins, to The Boston Herald, describing the death of birds around her property resulting from the aerial spraying of DDT to kill mosquitoes, a copy of which Huckins sent to Carson.[12][13][13] Carson later wrote that this letter prompted her to study the environmental problems caused by chemical pesticides.[14][15]\\r\\nThe Audubon Naturalist Society actively opposed chemical spraying programs and recruited Carson to help publicize the U.S. government's spraying practices and related research.[16] Carson began the four-year project of Silent Spring by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She tried to enlist essayist E. B. White and a number of journalists and scientists to her cause. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with Newsweek science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when The New Yorker commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it became a solo project. Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of Silent Spring.[17]\\r\\nAs her research progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and environmental effects of pesticides.[3] She took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information on the subject. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps; those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof and those who were open to the possibility of harm and were willing to consider alternative methods, such as biological pest control.[18]\\r\\nBy 1959, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service responded to the criticism by Carson and others with a public service film, Fire Ants on Trial; Carson called it \\"flagrant propaganda\\" that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in The Washington Post, that attributed the recent decline in bird populationsin her words, the \\"silencing of birds\\"to pesticide overuse.[19] The same year, the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of U.S. cranberries were found to contain high levels of the herbicide aminotriazole and the sale of all cranberry products was halted. Carson attended the ensuing FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she was discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying. She also wondered about the possible \\"financial inducements behind certain pesticide programs\\".[20]\\r\\nResearch at the Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health brought Carson into contact with medical researchers investigating the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance was the work of National Cancer Institute researcher and founding director of the environmental cancer section Wilhelm Hueper, who classified many pesticides as carcinogens. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide carcinogenesis.[21]\\r\\nBy 1960, Carson had sufficient research material and the writing was progressing rapidly. She had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the resulting human sickness and ecological damage. In January 1960, she suffered an illness which kept her bedridden for weeks, delaying the book. As she was nearing full recovery in March, she discovered cysts in her left breast, requiring a mastectomy. By December that year, Carson discovered that she had breast cancer, which had metastasized.[22] Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann.[23] Most of the research and writing was done by the fall of 1960, except for a discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations of some new pesticides. However, further health troubles delayed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.[24]\\r\\nIts title was inspired by a poem by John Keats, \\"La Belle Dame sans Merci\\", which contained the lines \\"The sedge is wither'd from the lake, And no birds sing.\\"[25] \\"Silent Spring\\" was initially suggested as a title for the chapter on birds. By August 1961, Carson agreed to the suggestion of her literary agent Marie Rodell: Silent Spring would be a metaphorical title for the entire booksuggesting a bleak future for the whole natural worldrather than a literal chapter title about the absence of birdsong.[26] With Carson's approval, editor Paul Brooks at Houghton Mifflin arranged for illustrations by Louis and Lois Darling, who also designed the cover. The final writing was the first chapter, \\"A Fable for Tomorrow\\", which was intended to provide a gentle introduction to a serious topic. By mid-1962, Brooks and Carson had largely finished the editing and were planning to promote the book by sending the manuscript to select individuals for final suggestions.[27] In Silent Spring, Carson relied on evidence from two New York state organic farmers, Marjorie Spock and Mary Richards, and that of biodynamic farming advocate Ehrenfried Pfeiffer in developing her case against DDT.[3]\\r\\nThe overriding theme of Silent Spring is the powerfuland often negativeeffect humans have on the natural world.[28] Carson's main argument is that pesticides have detrimental effects on the environment; she says these are more properly termed \\"biocides\\" because their effects are rarely limited to the target pests. DDT is a prime example, but other synthetic pesticidesmany of which are subject to bioaccumulationare scrutinized. Carson accuses the chemical industry of intentionally spreading disinformation and public officials of accepting industry claims uncritically. Most of the book is devoted to pesticides' effects on natural ecosystems, but four chapters detail cases of human pesticide poisoning, cancer, and other illnesses attributed to pesticides.[29] About DDT and cancer, Carson says only:\\r\\nIn laboratory tests on animal subjects, DDT has produced suspicious liver tumors. Scientists of the Food and Drug Administration who reported the discovery of these tumors were uncertain how to classify them, but felt there was some \\"justification for considering them low grade hepatic cell carcinomas.\\" Dr. Hueper [author of Occupational Tumors and Allied Diseases] now gives DDT the definite rating of a \\"chemical carcinogen.\\"[30]\\r\\nCarson predicts increased consequences in the future, especially since targeted pests may develop resistance to pesticides and weakened ecosystems fall prey to unanticipated invasive species. The book closes with a call for a biotic approach to pest control as an alternative to chemical pesticides.[31]\\r\\nCarson never called for an outright ban on DDT. She said in Silent Spring that even if DDT and other insecticides had no environmental side effects, their indiscriminate overuse was counterproductive because it would create insect resistance to pesticides, making them useless in eliminating the target insect populations:\\r\\nNo responsible person contends that insect-borne disease should be ignored. The question that has now urgently presented itself is whether it is either wise or responsible to attack the problem by methods that are rapidly making it worse. The world has heard much of the triumphant war against disease through the control of insect vectors of infection, but it has heard little of the other side of the storythe defeats, the short-lived triumphs that now strongly support the alarming view that the insect enemy has been made actually stronger by our efforts. Even worse, we may have destroyed our very means of fighting.[32]\\r\\nCarson also said that \\"Malaria programmes are threatened by resistance among mosquitoes\\",[33] and quoted the advice given by the director of Holland's Plant Protection Service: \\"Practical advice should be 'Spray as little as you possibly can' rather than 'Spray to the limit of your capacity'. Pressure on the pest population should always be as slight as possible.\\"[34]\\r\\nCarson and the others involved with publication of Silent Spring expected fierce criticism and were concerned about the possibility of being sued for libel. Carson was undergoing radiation therapy for her cancer and expected to have little energy to defend her work and respond to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass prominent supporters before the book's release.[35]\\r\\nMost of the book's scientific chapters were reviewed by scientists with relevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support. Carson attended the White House Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of Silent Spring to many of the delegates and promoted the upcoming serialization in The New Yorker. Carson also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas, a long-time environmental advocate who had argued against the court's rejection of the Long Island pesticide spraying case and had provided Carson with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides.[36]\\r\\nThough Silent Spring had generated a fairly high level of interest based on pre-publication promotion, this became more intense with its serialization, which began in the June 16, 1962, issue.[37] This brought the book to the attention of the chemical industry and its lobbyists, as well as the American public. Around that time, Carson learned that Silent Spring had been selected as the Book-of-the-Month for October; she said this would \\"carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don't know what a bookstore looks likemuch less The New Yorker.\\"[38] Other publicity included a positive editorial in The New York Times and excerpts of the serialized version were published in Audubon Magazine. There was another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The story of the birth defect-causing drug thalidomide had broken just before the book's publication, inviting comparisons between Carson and Frances Oldham Kelsey, the Food and Drug Administration reviewer who had blocked the drug's sale in the United States.[39]\\r\\nIn the weeks before the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong opposition to Silent Spring from the chemical industry. DuPont, a major manufacturer of DDT and 2,4-D, and Velsicol Chemical Company, the only manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor, were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin, and The New Yorker and Audubon Magazine unless their planned Silent Spring features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process Silent Spring had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing, which included a pamphlet by William O. Douglas endorsing the book.[41]\\r\\nAmerican Cyanamid biochemist Robert White-Stevens and former Cyanamid chemist Thomas Jukes were among the most aggressive critics, especially of Carson's analysis of DDT.[42] According to White-Stevens, \\"If man were to follow the teachings of Miss Carson, we would return to the Dark Ages, and the insects and diseases and vermin would once again inherit the earth\\".[1] Others attacked Carson's personal character and scientific credentials, her training being in marine biology rather than biochemistry. White-Stevens called her \\"a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature\\",[43] while former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson in a letter to former President Dwight D. Eisenhower reportedly said that because she was unmarried despite being physically attractive, she was \\"probably a Communist\\".[44]\\r\\nMany critics repeatedly said Carson was calling for the elimination of all pesticides, but she had made it clear she was not advocating this but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals' impact on ecosystems.[45] She concludes her section on DDT in Silent Spring with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.[46] Mark Hamilton Lytle writes, Carson \\"quite self-consciously decided to write a book calling into question the paradigm of scientific progress that defined postwar American culture\\".[28]\\r\\nThe academic communityincluding prominent defenders such as H. J. Muller, Loren Eiseley, Clarence Cottam and Frank Eglermostly backed the book's scientific claims and public opinion backed Carson's text. The chemical industry campaign was counterproductive because the controversy increased public awareness of the potential dangers of pesticides. Pesticide use became a major public issue after a CBS Reports television special, \\"The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson\\", which was broadcast on April 3, 1963. The program included segments of Carson reading from Silent Spring and interviews with other experts, mostly critics including White-Stevens. According to biographer Linda Lear, \\"in juxtaposition to the wild-eyed, loud-voiced Dr. Robert White-Stevens in white lab coat, Carson appeared anything but the hysterical alarmist that her critics contended\\".[47] Reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide hazards and the public release of a pesticide report by the President's Science Advisory Committee.[48] Within a year of publication, attacks on the book and on Carson had lost momentum.[49][50]\\r\\nIn one of her last public appearances, Carson testified before President John F. Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee, which issued its report on May 15, 1963, largely backing Carson's scientific claims.[51] Following the report's release, Carson also testified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee to make policy recommendations. Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, she was unable to accept most of them because her health was steadily declining, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she could, and appeared on The Today Show and gave speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the Audubon Medal from the National Audubon Society, the Cullum Geographical Medal from the American Geographical Society, and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.[52]\\r\\nThe book has been translated into German (under the title: Der stumme Frhling), with the first German edition appearing in 1963, followed by a number of later editions.[53]\\r\\nIt was translated into French (as Le printemps silencieux), with the first French edition also appearing in 1963.[54]\\r\\nIn 1965 Silent Spring had been published in USSR in Russian (under the title 似־ ־).[55]\\r\\nThe book's Italian title is Primavera silenziosa.;[56] and the Spanish title is Primavera silenciosa.[57]\\r\\nIt was translated to Swedish and published in 1963, titled Tyst v?r.\\r\\nCarson's work had a powerful impact on the environmental movement. Silent Spring became a rallying point for the new social movement in the 1960s. According to environmental engineer and Carson scholar H. Patricia Hynes, \\"Silent Spring altered the balance of power in the world. No one since would be able to sell pollution as the necessary underside of progress so easily or uncritically.\\"[58] Carson's work and the activism it inspired are partly responsible for the deep ecology movement and the strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s. It was also influential on the rise of ecofeminism and on many feminist scientists.[59] Carson's most direct legacy in the environmental movement was the campaign to ban the use of DDT in the United States, and related efforts to ban or limit its use throughout the world. The 1967 formation of the Environmental Defense Fund was the first major milestone in the campaign against DDT. The organization brought lawsuits against the government to \\"establish a citizen's right to a clean environment\\", and the arguments against DDT largely mirrored Carson's. By 1972, the Environmental Defense Fund and other activist groups had succeeded in securing a phase-out of DDT use in the United States, except in emergency cases.[60]\\r\\nThe creation of the Environmental Protection Agency by the Nixon Administration in 1970 addressed another concern that Carson had written about. Until then, the USDA was responsible both for regulating pesticides and promoting the concerns of the agriculture industry; Carson saw this as a conflict of interest, since the agency was not responsible for effects on wildlife or other environmental concerns beyond farm policy. Fifteen years after its creation, one journalist described the EPA as \\"the extended shadow of Silent Spring\\". Much of the agency's early work, such as enforcement of the 1972 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, was directly related to Carson's work.[61] Contrary to the position of the pesticide industry, the DDT phase-out action taken by the EPA (led by William Ruckelshaus) implied that there was no way to adequately regulate DDT use. Ruckelshaus' conclusion was that DDT could not be used safely.[62] History professor Gary Kroll wrote, \\"Rachel Carson's Silent Spring played a large role in articulating ecology as a 'subversive subject'as a perspective that cuts against the grain of materialism, scientism, and the technologically engineered control of nature.\\"[63]\\r\\nIn a 2013 interview, Ruckelshaus briefly recounted his decision to ban DDT except for emergency uses, noting that Carsons book featured DDT and for that reason the issue drew considerable public attention. [64]\\r\\nFormer Vice President of the United States and environmentalist Al Gore wrote an introduction to the 1992 edition of Silent Spring. He wrote: \\"Silent Spring had a profound impact?...?Indeed, Rachel Carson was one of the reasons that I became so conscious of the environment and so involved with environmental issues ?...? [she] has had as much or more effect on me than any, and perhaps than all of them together.\\"[1]\\r\\nCarson and the environmental movement wereand continue to becriticized by some who argue that restrictions on the use of pesticidesspecifically DDThave caused tens of millions of needless deaths and hampered agriculture, and implicitly that Carson was responsible for inciting such restrictions.[65][66][67] These arguments have been dismissed as \\"outrageous\\" by former WHO scientist Socrates Litsios. May Berenbaum, University of Illinois entomologist, says, \\"to blame environmentalists who oppose DDT for more deaths than Hitler is worse than irresponsible.\\"[68] Investigative journalist Adam Sarvana and others characterize this notion as a \\"myth\\" promoted principally by Roger Bate of the pro-DDT advocacy group Africa Fighting Malaria (AFM).[69][70]\\r\\nIn the 2000s, criticism of the bans of DDT that her work prompted intensified.[71][72] In 2009, the libertarian think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute set up a website saying, \\"Millions of people around the world suffer the painful and often deadly effects of malaria because one person sounded a false alarm. That person is Rachel Carson.\\"[72][73] A 2012 review article in Nature by Rob Dunn[74] commemorating the 50th anniversary of Silent Spring prompted a response in a letter written by Anthony Trewavas and co-signed by 10 others, including Christopher Leaver, Bruce Ames, Richard Tren and Peter Lachmann, who quote estimates of 60 to 80 million deaths \\"as a result of misguided fears based on poorly understood evidence\\".[75]\\r\\nBiographer Hamilton Lytle believes these estimates are unrealistic, even if Carson can be \\"blamed\\" for worldwide DDT policies.[76] John Quiggin and Tim Lambert wrote, \\"the most striking feature of the claim against Carson is the ease with which it can be refuted\\". DDT was never banned for anti-malarial use, and its ban for agricultural use in the United States in 1972 did not apply outside the U.S. nor to anti-malaria spraying.[77][78] The international treaty that banned most uses of DDT and other organochlorine pesticidesthe 2001 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (which became effective in 2004)included an exemption for the use of DDT for malaria control until affordable substitutes could be found.[71] Mass outdoor spraying of DDT was abandoned in poor countries subject to malaria, such as Sri Lanka, in the 1970s and 1980s; this was not because of government prohibitions but because the DDT had lost its ability to kill the mosquitoes.[71] Because of insects' very short breeding cycle and large number of offspring, the most resistant insects survive and pass on their genetic traits to their offspring, which replace the pesticide-slain insects relatively rapidly. Agricultural spraying of pesticides produces pesticide resistance in seven to ten years.[79]\\r\\nSome experts have said that restrictions placed on the agricultural use of DDT have increased its effectiveness for malaria control. According to pro-DDT advocate Amir Attaran, the result of the (activated in 2004) Stockholm Convention banning DDT's use in agriculture \\"is arguably better than the status quo?...?For the first time, there is now an insecticide which is restricted to vector control only, meaning that the selection of resistant mosquitoes will be slower than before.\\"[80]\\r\\nWhile Carson gave accurate accounts of the scientific consensus at the time she wrote the book, much has changed in a half century. For example, the linkage between agricultural chemicals and disease, especially cancer, remains \\"frustratingly murky.\\" Charles C. Mann argued in 2018:[81]\\r\\nSilent Spring has been featured in many lists of the best nonfiction books of the twentieth century. It was fifth in the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Nonfiction and number 78 in the National Review's 100 best non-fiction books of the 20th century.[82] In 2006, Silent Spring was named one of the 25 greatest science books of all time by the editors of Discover Magazine.[7] In 2012, the American Chemical Society designated the legacy of Silent Spring a National Historic Chemical Landmark at Chatham University in Pittsburgh.[83]\\r\\nIn 1996, a follow-up book, Beyond Silent Spring, co-written by H.F. van Emden and David Peakall, was published.[5][6]\\r\\nIn 2011, the American composer Steven Stucky wrote the eponymously titled symphonic poem Silent Spring to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the book's publication. The piece was given its world premiere in Pittsburgh on February 17, 2012, with the conductor Manfred Honeck leading the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.[84][85][86]\\r\\nNaturalist Sir David Attenborough has stated that Silent Spring was probably the book that had changed the scientific world the most, after the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin.[87]","input":"Who is the female author of silent spring?"},{"output":"Nairobi","context":"","input":"What is the capital city of kenya wikianswers?"},{"output":"100 U.S. Senators","context":"Majority (51)\\r\\nMinority (49)\\r\\nThe United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress, which along with the United States House of Representativesthe lower chambercomposes the legislature of the United States.\\r\\nThe composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution.[1] The Senate is composed of senators, each of whom represents a single state in its entirety, with each state being equally represented by two senators, regardless of its population, serving staggered terms of six years; with fifty states presently in the Union, there are 100 U.S. Senators. From 1789 until 1913, Senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented; following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, they are now popularly elected. The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol, in Washington, D.C.\\r\\nAs the upper house, the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it; these include the ratification of treaties and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries, Supreme Court justices, federal judges, other federal executive officials, flag officers, regulatory officials, ambassadors, and other federal uniformed officers. In addition to these, in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for Vice President, the duty befalls upon the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office. It further has the responsibility of conducting trials of those impeached by the House. The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative[2] and more prestigious[3][4][5] body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms, smaller size, and statewide constituencies, which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere.[6]\\r\\nThe presiding officer of the Senate is the Vice President of the United States, who is President of the Senate. In the Vice President's absence, the President Pro Tempore, who is customarily the senior member of the party holding a majority of seats, presides over the Senate. In the early 20th century, the practice of majority and minority parties electing their floor leaders began, although they are not constitutional officers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe writers of the Constitution created a bicameral Congress primarily as a compromise between those who felt that each state, since it was sovereign, should be equally represented, and those who felt the Legislature must directly represent the people, as the House of Commons did in the United Kingdom. This idea of having one chamber represent people equally, while the other gives equal representation to states regardless of population, was known as the Connecticut Compromise. There was also a desire to have two Houses that could act as an internal check on each other. One was intended to be a \\"People's House\\" directly elected by the people, and with short terms obliging the representatives to remain close to their constituents. The other was intended to represent the states to such extent as they retained their sovereignty except for the powers expressly delegated to the national government. The Senate was thus not designed to serve the people of the United States equally. The Constitution provides that the approval of both chambers is necessary for the passage of legislation.[7]\\r\\nFirst convened in 1789, the Senate of the United States was formed on the example of the ancient Roman Senate. The name is derived from the senatus, Latin for council of elders (from senex meaning old man in Latin).[8]\\r\\nJames Madison made the following comment about the Senate:\\r\\nIn England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation. Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and check the other. They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority. The senate, therefore, ought to be this body; and to answer these purposes, the people ought to have permanency and stability.[9]\\r\\nThe Constitution stipulates that no constitutional amendment may be created to deprive a state of its equal suffrage in the Senate without that state's consent. The District of Columbia and all other territories are not entitled to representation allowed to vote in either House of the Congress. The District of Columbia elects two \\"shadow U.S. Senators\\", but they are officials of the D.C. City Government and not members of the U.S. Senate.[10] The United States has had 50 states since 1959,[11] thus the Senate has had 100 senators since 1959.[12]\\r\\nThe disparity between the most and least populous states has grown since the Connecticut Compromise, which granted each state two members of the Senate and at least one member of the House of Representatives, for a total minimum of three presidential Electors, regardless of population. In 1787, Virginia had roughly ten times the population of Rhode Island, whereas today California has roughly 70 times the population of Wyoming, based on the 1790 and 2000 censuses. This means some citizens are effectively two orders of magnitude better represented in the Senate than those in other states. Seats in the House of Representatives are approximately proportionate to the population of each state, reducing the disparity of representation.\\r\\nBefore the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, Senators were elected by the individual state legislatures.[14] Problems with repeated vacant seats due to the inability of a legislature to elect senators, intrastate political struggles, and even bribery and intimidation had gradually led to a growing movement to amend the Constitution to allow for the direct election of senators.[15]\\r\\nArticle I, Section 3 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for senators: (1) they must be at least 30 years old; (2) they must have been citizens of the United States for the past 9 years or longer; and (3) they must be inhabitants of the states they seek to represent at the time of their election. The age and citizenship qualifications for senators are more stringent than those for representatives. In Federalist No. 62, James Madison justified this arrangement by arguing that the \\"senatorial trust\\" called for a \\"greater extent of information and stability of character.\\"\\r\\nThe Senate (not the judiciary) is the sole judge of a senator's qualifications. During its early years, however, the Senate did not closely scrutinize the qualifications of its members. As a result, three senators who failed to meet the age requirement were nevertheless admitted to the Senate: Henry Clay (aged 29 in 1806), Armistead Thomson Mason (aged 28 in 1816), and John Eaton (aged 28 in 1818). Such an occurrence, however, has not been repeated since.[16] In 1934, Rush D. Holt Sr. was elected to the Senate at the age of 29; he waited until he turned 30 (on the next June 19) to take the oath of office. In November 1972, Joe Biden was elected to the Senate at the age of 29, but he reached his 30th birthday before the swearing-in ceremony for incoming senators in January 1973.\\r\\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution disqualifies from the Senate any federal or state officers who had taken the requisite oath to support the Constitution, but later engaged in rebellion or aided the enemies of the United States. This provision, which came into force soon after the end of the Civil War, was intended to prevent those who had sided with the Confederacy from serving. That Amendment, however, also provides a method to remove that disqualification: a two-thirds vote of both chambers of Congress.\\r\\nOriginally, senators were selected by the state legislatures, not by popular elections. By the early years of the 20th century, the legislatures of as many as 29 states had provided for popular election of senators by referendums.[17] Popular election to the Senate was standardized nationally in 1913 by the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment.\\r\\nSenators serve terms of six years each; the terms are staggered so that approximately one-third of the seats are up for election every two years. This was achieved by dividing the senators of the 1st Congress into thirds (called classes), where the terms of one-third expired after two years, the terms of another third expired after four, and the terms of the last third expired after six years. This arrangement was also followed after the admission of new states into the union. The staggering of terms has been arranged such that both seats from a given state are not contested in the same general election, except when a mid-term vacancy is being filled. Current senators whose six-year terms are set to expire on January 3, 2019, belong to Class I.\\r\\nThe Constitution set the date for Congress to conveneArticle 1, Section 4, Clause 2 originally set that date for the third day of December. The Twentieth Amendment, however, changed the opening date for sessions to noon on the third day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day. The Twentieth Amendment also states that Congress shall assemble at least once in every year and allows Congress to determine its convening and adjournment dates and other dates and schedules as it desires. Article 1, Section 3 provides that the President has the power to convene Congress on extraordinary occasions at his discretion.\\r\\nA member who has been elected, but not yet seated, is called a \\"senator-elect\\"; a member who has been appointed to a seat, but not yet seated, is called a \\"senator-designate\\".\\r\\nElections to the Senate are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years, Election Day, and coincide with elections for the House of Representatives.[18] Senators are elected by their state as a whole. In most states (since 1970), a primary election is held first for the Republican and Democratic parties, with the general election following a few months later. Ballot access rules for independent and minor party candidates vary from state to state. The winner is often the candidate who receives a plurality of the popular vote. In some states, runoffs are held if no candidate wins a majority.\\r\\nThe Seventeenth Amendment requires that mid-term vacancies in the Senate be filled by special election. Whenever a Senator must be appointed or elected, the Secretary of the Senate mails one of three forms to the state's governor to inform them of the proper wording to certify the appointment of a new senator.[19] If a special election for one seat happens to coincide with a general election for the state's other seat, each seat is contested separately. A senator elected in a special election takes office as soon as possible after the election and serves until the original six-year term expires (i.e. not for a full term).\\r\\nThe Seventeenth Amendment also allows state legislatures to give their governors the power \\"to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct\\". The temporary appointee may run in the special election in their own right.\\r\\nAs of 2015, forty-five states permit their governors to make such appointments. In thirty-seven of these states, the special election to permanently fill the U.S. Senate seat is customarily held at the next biennial congressional election. The other nine states require that special elections be held outside of the normal two-year election cycle in some or all circumstances. In four states (Arizona, Hawaii, Utah, and Wyoming) the governor must appoint someone of the same political party as the previous incumbent.\\r\\nOregon, Wisconsin and Oklahoma require special elections for vacancies with no interim appointment.[20] In September 2009, Massachusetts changed its law to enable the governor to appoint a temporary replacement for the late Senator Edward Kennedy until the special election in January 2010.[21][22]\\r\\nIn 2004, Alaska enacted legislation and a separate ballot referendum that took effect on the same day, but that conflicted with each other. The effect of the ballot-approved law is to withhold from the governor authority to appoint a senator.[23] Because the 17th Amendment vests the power to grant that authority to the legislature?ÿ not the people or the state generally?ÿ it is unclear whether the ballot measure supplants the legislature's statute granting that authority.[23] As a result, it is uncertain whether an Alaska governor may appoint an interim senator to serve until a special election is held to fill the vacancy.\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution requires that senators take an oath or affirmation to support the Constitution.[24] Congress has prescribed the following oath for all federal officials (except the President), including senators:\\r\\nI, ___ ___, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.[25]\\r\\nThe annual salary of each senator, since 2009, is $174,000;[26] the president pro tempore and party leaders receive $193,400.[26][27] In June 2003, at least 40 of the then-senators were millionaires.[28]\\r\\nAlong with earning salaries, senators receive retirement and health benefits that are identical to other federal employees, and are fully vested after five years of service.[27] Senators are covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) or Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). As it is for federal employees, congressional retirement is funded through taxes and the participants' contributions. Under FERS, senators contribute 1.3% of their salary into the FERS retirement plan and pay 6.2% of their salary in Social Security taxes. The amount of a senator's pension depends on the years of service and the average of the highest 3 years of their salary. The starting amount of a senator's retirement annuity may not exceed 80% of their final salary. In 2006, the average annual pension for retired senators and representatives under CSRS was $60,972, while those who retired under FERS, or in combination with CSRS, was $35,952.[27]\\r\\nSenators are regarded as more prominent political figures than members of the House of Representatives because there are fewer of them, and because they serve for longer terms, usually represent larger constituencies (the exception being House at-large districts, which similarly cover entire states), sit on more committees, and have more staffers. Far more senators have been nominees for the presidency than representatives. Furthermore, three senators (Warren Harding, John F. Kennedy, and Barack Obama) have been elected president while serving in the Senate, while only one Representative (James Garfield) has been elected president while serving in the House, though Garfield was also a Senator-designate at the time of his election to the Presidency, having been chosen by the Ohio Legislature to fill a Senate vacancy.\\r\\nAccording to the convention of Senate seniority, the senator with the longer tenure in each state is known as the \\"senior senator\\"; the other is the \\"junior senator\\". This convention does not have official significance, though seniority generally is a factor in the selection of physical offices.[29] In the 115th Congress, the most-senior \\"junior senator\\" is Maria Cantwell of Washington, who was sworn in on January 3, 2001 and is currently 21st in seniority, behind Patty Murray who was sworn in on January 3, 1993 and is currently 9th in seniority. The most-junior \\"senior senator\\" is Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who was sworn in January 3, 2015, and is currently 81st in seniority, ahead of senator John Neely Kennedy who was sworn in January 3, 2017 and is currently 98th in seniority.\\r\\nThe Senate may expel a senator by a two-thirds vote. Fifteen senators have been expelled in the Senate's history: William Blount, for treason, in 1797, and fourteen in 1861 and 1862 for supporting the Confederate secession. Although no senator has been expelled since 1862, many senators have chosen to resign when faced with expulsion proceedings?ÿ for example, Bob Packwood in 1995. The Senate has also censured and condemned senators; censure requires only a simple majority and does not remove a senator from office. Some senators have opted to withdraw from their re-election races rather than face certain censure or expulsion, such as Robert Torricelli in 2002.\\r\\nThe \\"Majority party\\" is the political party that either has a majority of seats or can form a coalition or caucus with a majority of seats; if two or more parties are tied, the vice president's affiliation determines which party is the majority party. The next-largest party is known as the minority party. The president pro tempore, committee chairs, and some other officials are generally from the majority party; they have counterparts (for instance, the \\"ranking members\\" of committees) in the minority party. Independents and members of third parties (so long as they do not caucus with or support either of the larger parties) are not considered in determining which is the majority party.\\r\\nAt one end of the chamber of the Senate is a dais from which the presiding officer presides. The lower tier of the dais is used by clerks and other officials. One hundred desks are arranged in the chamber in a semicircular pattern and are divided by a wide central aisle. The Democratic Party traditionally sits to the presiding officer's right, and the Republican Party traditionally sits to the presiding officer's left, regardless of which party has a majority of seats.[30] In this respect, the Senate differs from the House of Commons of the United Kingdom and other parliamentary bodies in the Commonwealth of Nations and elsewhere.\\r\\nEach senator chooses a desk based on seniority within the party. By custom, the leader of each party sits in the front row along the center aisle. Forty-eight of the desks date back to 1819, when the Senate chamber was reconstructed after the original contents were destroyed in the 1812 Burning of Washington. Further desks of similar design were added as new states entered the Union.[31] It is a tradition that each senator who uses a desk inscribes their name on the inside of the desk's drawer.[32]\\r\\nExcept for the President of the Senate, the Senate elects its own officers,[1] who maintain order and decorum, manage and schedule the legislative and executive business of the Senate, and interpret the Senate's rules, practices and precedents. Many non-member officers are also hired to run various day-to-day functions of the Senate.\\r\\nUnder the Constitution, the Vice President serves as President of the Senate. He or she may vote in the Senate (ex officio, for he or she is not an elected member of the Senate) in the case of a tie, but is not required to.[33] For much of the nation's history the task of presiding over Senate sessions was one of the Vice President's principal duties (the other being to receive from the states the tally of electoral ballots cast for President and Vice President and to open the certificates \\"in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives,\\" so that the total votes could be counted). Since the 1950s, Vice Presidents have presided over few Senate debates. Instead, they have usually presided only on ceremonial occasions, such as swearing in new senators, joint sessions, or at times to announce the result of significant legislation or nomination, or when a tie vote on an important issue is anticipated.\\r\\nThe Constitution authorizes the Senate to elect a president pro tempore (Latin for \\"president for a time\\") who presides over the chamber in the vice president's absence, and is, by custom, the senator of the majority party with the longest record of continuous service.[34] Like the vice president, the president pro tempore does not normally preside over the Senate, but typically delegates the responsibility of presiding to a majority-party senator who presides over the Senate, usually in blocks of one hour on a rotating basis. Frequently, freshmen senators (newly elected members) are asked to preside so that they may become accustomed to the rules and procedures of the body. It is said that, \\"in practice they are usually mere mouthpieces for the Senates parliamentarian, who whispers what they should do\\".[35]\\r\\nThe presiding officer sits in a chair in the front of the Senate chamber. The powers of the presiding officer of the Senate are far less extensive than those of the Speaker of the House. The presiding officer calls on senators to speak (by the rules of the Senate, the first senator who rises is recognized); ruling on points of order (objections by senators that a rule has been breached, subject to appeal to the whole chamber); and announcing the results of votes.\\r\\nEach party elects Senate party leaders. Floor leaders act as the party chief spokesmen. The Senate Majority Leader is responsible for controlling the agenda of the chamber by scheduling debates and votes. Each party elects an assistant leader (whip) who works to ensure that his party's senators vote as the party leadership desires.\\r\\nIn addition to the Vice President, the Senate has several officers who are not members. The Senate's chief administrative officer is the Secretary of the Senate, who maintains public records, disburses salaries, monitors the acquisition of stationery and supplies, and oversees clerks. The Assistant Secretary of the Senate aids the secretary's work. Another official is the Sergeant at Arms who, as the Senate's chief law enforcement officer, maintains order and security on the Senate premises. The Capitol Police handle routine police work, with the sergeant at arms primarily responsible for general oversight. Other employees include the Chaplain, who is elected by the Senate, and Pages, who are appointed.\\r\\nThe Senate uses Standing Rules for operation. Like the House of Representatives, the Senate meets in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. At one end of the chamber of the Senate is a dais from which the presiding officer presides. The lower tier of the dais is used by clerks and other officials. Sessions of the Senate are opened with a special prayer or invocation and typically convene on weekdays. Sessions of the Senate are generally open to the public and are broadcast live on television, usually by C-SPAN 2.\\r\\nSenate procedure depends not only on the rules, but also on a variety of customs and traditions. The Senate commonly waives some of its stricter rules by unanimous consent. Unanimous consent agreements are typically negotiated beforehand by party leaders. A senator may block such an agreement, but in practice, objections are rare. The presiding officer enforces the rules of the Senate, and may warn members who deviate from them. The presiding officer sometimes uses the gavel of the Senate to maintain order.\\r\\nA \\"hold\\" is placed when the leader's office is notified that a senator intends to object to a request for unanimous consent from the Senate to consider or pass a measure. A hold may be placed for any reason and can be lifted by a senator at any time. A senator may place a hold simply to review a bill, to negotiate changes to the bill, or to kill the bill. A bill can be held for as long as the senator who objects to the bill wishes to block its consideration.\\r\\nHolds can be overcome, but require time-consuming procedures such as filing cloture. Holds are considered private communications between a senator and the Leader, and are sometimes referred to as \\"secret holds\\". A senator may disclose that he or she has placed a hold.\\r\\nThe Constitution provides that a majority of the Senate constitutes a quorum to do business. Under the rules and customs of the Senate, a quorum is always assumed present unless a quorum call explicitly demonstrates otherwise. A senator may request a quorum call by \\"suggesting the absence of a quorum\\"; a clerk then calls the roll of the Senate and notes which members are present. In practice, senators rarely request quorum calls to establish the presence of a quorum. Instead, quorum calls are generally used to temporarily delay proceedings; usually such delays are used while waiting for a senator to reach the floor to speak or to give leaders time to negotiate. Once the need for a delay has ended, a senator may request unanimous consent to rescind the quorum call.\\r\\nDebate, like most other matters governing the internal functioning of the Senate, is governed by internal rules adopted by the Senate. During debate, senators may only speak if called upon by the presiding officer, but the presiding officer is required to recognize the first senator who rises to speak. Thus, the presiding officer has little control over the course of debate. Customarily, the Majority Leader and Minority Leader are accorded priority during debates even if another senator rises first. All speeches must be addressed to the presiding officer, who is addressed as \\"Mr. President\\" or \\"Madam President\\", and not to another member; other Members must be referred to in the third person. In most cases, senators do not refer to each other by name, but by state or position, using forms such as \\"the senior senator from Virginia\\", \\"the gentleman from California\\", or \\"my distinguished friend the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee\\". Senators address the Senate standing next to their desk.[36]\\r\\nApart from rules governing civility, there are few restrictions on the content of speeches; there is no requirement that speeches be germane to the matter before the Senate.\\r\\nThe rules of the Senate provide that no senator may make more than two speeches on a motion or bill on the same legislative day. A legislative day begins when the Senate convenes and ends with adjournment; hence, it does not necessarily coincide with the calendar day. The length of these speeches is not limited by the rules; thus, in most cases, senators may speak for as long as they please. Often, the Senate adopts unanimous consent agreements imposing time limits. In other cases (for example, for the budget process), limits are imposed by statute. However, the right to unlimited debate is generally preserved.\\r\\nWithin the United States, the Senate is sometimes referred to as \\"world's greatest deliberative body\\".[37][38][39]\\r\\nThe filibuster is a tactic used to defeat bills and motions by prolonging debate indefinitely. A filibuster may entail long speeches, dilatory motions, and an extensive series of proposed amendments. The Senate may end a filibuster by invoking cloture. In most cases, cloture requires the support of three-fifths of the Senate; however, if the matter before the Senate involves changing the rules of the body?ÿ this includes amending provisions regarding the filibuster?ÿ a two-thirds majority is required. In current practice, the threat of filibuster is more important than its use; almost any motion that does not have the support of three-fifths of the Senate effectively fails. This means that 41 senators can make a filibuster happen. Historically, cloture has rarely been invoked because bipartisan support is usually necessary to obtain the required supermajority, so a bill that already has bipartisan support is rarely subject to threats of filibuster. However, motions for cloture have increased significantly in recent years.\\r\\nIf the Senate invokes cloture, debate does not end immediately; instead, it is limited to 2 additional hours unless increased by another three-fifths vote. The longest filibuster speech in the Senate's history was delivered by Strom Thurmond, who spoke for over 24 hours in an unsuccessful attempt to block the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957.[40]\\r\\nUnder certain circumstances, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 provides for a process called \\"reconciliation\\" by which Congress can pass bills related to the budget without those bills being subject to a filibuster. This is accomplished by limiting all Senate floor debate to 20 hours.[41]\\r\\nWhen debate concludes, the motion in question is put to a vote. The Senate often votes by voice vote. The presiding officer puts the question, and Members respond either \\"Yea/Aye\\" (in favor of the motion) or \\"Nay\\" (against the motion). The presiding officer then announces the result of the voice vote. A senator, however, may challenge the presiding officer's assessment and request a recorded vote. The request may be granted only if it is seconded by one-fifth of the senators present. In practice, however, senators second requests for recorded votes as a matter of courtesy. When a recorded vote is held, the clerk calls the roll of the Senate in alphabetical order; senators respond when their name is called. Senators who were not in the chamber when their name was called may still cast a vote so long as the voting remains open. The vote is closed at the discretion of the presiding officer, but must remain open for a minimum of 15 minutes. A majority of those voting determines whether the motion carries.[42] If the vote is tied, the vice president, if present, is entitled to cast a tie-breaking vote. If the vice president is not present, the motion fails.[43]\\r\\nFilibustered bills require a three-fifths majority to overcome the cloture vote (which usually means 60 votes) and get to the normal vote where a simple majority (usually 51 votes) approves the bill. This has caused some news media to confuse the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster with the 51 votes needed to approve a bill, with for example USA Today erroneously stating \\"The vote was 58-39 in favor of the provision establishing concealed carry permit reciprocity in the 48 states that have concealed weapons laws. That fell two votes short of the 60 needed to approve the measure\\".[42]\\r\\nOn occasion, the Senate may go into what is called a secret or closed session. During a closed session, the chamber doors are closed, cameras are turned off, and the galleries are completely cleared of anyone not sworn to secrecy, not instructed in the rules of the closed session, or not essential to the session. Closed sessions are rare and usually held only when the Senate is discussing sensitive subject matter such as information critical to national security, private communications from the president, or deliberations during impeachment trials. A senator may call for and force a closed session if the motion is seconded by at least one other member, but an agreement usually occurs beforehand.[44][45] If the Senate does not approve release of a secret transcript, the transcript is stored in the Office of Senate Security and ultimately sent to the national archives. The proceedings remain sealed indefinitely until the Senate votes to remove the injunction of secrecy.[46] In 1973 the House adopted a rule that all committee sessions should be open unless a majority on the committee voted for a closed session.\\r\\nThe Senate maintains a Senate Calendar and an Executive Calendar.[47] The former identifies bills and resolutions awaiting Senate floor actions. The latter identifies executive resolutions, treaties, and nominations reported out by Senate committee(s) and awaiting Senate floor action. Both are updated each day the Senate is in session.\\r\\nThe Senate uses committees (and their subcommittees) for a variety of purposes, including the review of bills and the oversight of the executive branch. Formally, the whole Senate appoints committee members. In practice, however, the choice of members is made by the political parties. Generally, each party honors the preferences of individual senators, giving priority based on seniority. Each party is allocated seats on committees in proportion to its overall strength.\\r\\nMost committee work is performed by 16 standing committees, each of which has jurisdiction over a field such as finance or foreign relations. Each standing committee may consider, amend, and report bills that fall under its jurisdiction. Furthermore, each standing committee considers presidential nominations to offices related to its jurisdiction. (For instance, the Judiciary Committee considers nominees for judgeships, and the Foreign Relations Committee considers nominees for positions in the Department of State.) Committees may block nominees and impede bills from reaching the floor of the Senate. Standing committees also oversee the departments and agencies of the executive branch. In discharging their duties, standing committees have the power to hold hearings and to subpoena witnesses and evidence.\\r\\nThe Senate also has several committees that are not considered standing committees. Such bodies are generally known as select or special committees; examples include the Select Committee on Ethics and the Special Committee on Aging. Legislation is referred to some of these committees, although the bulk of legislative work is performed by the standing committees. Committees may be established on an ad hoc basis for specific purposes; for instance, the Senate Watergate Committee was a special committee created to investigate the Watergate scandal. Such temporary committees cease to exist after fulfilling their tasks.\\r\\nThe Congress includes joint committees, which include members from both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Some joint committees oversee independent government bodies; for instance, the Joint Committee on the Library oversees the Library of Congress. Other joint committees serve to make advisory reports; for example, there exists a Joint Committee on Taxation. Bills and nominees are not referred to joint committees. Hence, the power of joint committees is considerably lower than those of standing committees.\\r\\nEach Senate committee and subcommittee is led by a chair (usually a member of the majority party). Formerly, committee chairs were determined purely by seniority; as a result, several elderly senators continued to serve as chair despite severe physical infirmity or even senility.[48] Committee chairs are elected, but, in practice, seniority is rarely bypassed. The chairs hold extensive powers: they control the committee's agenda, and so decide how much, if any, time to devote to the consideration of a bill; they act with the power of the committee in disapproving or delaying a bill or a nomination by the president; they manage on the floor of the full Senate the consideration of those bills the committee reports. This last role was particularly important in mid-century, when floor amendments were thought not to be collegial. They also have considerable influence: senators who cooperate with their committee chairs are likely to accomplish more good for their states than those who do not. The Senate rules and customs were reformed in the twentieth century, largely in the 1970s. Committee chairmen have less power and are generally more moderate and collegial in exercising it, than they were before reform.[49] The second-highest member, the spokesperson on the committee for the minority party, is known in most cases as the ranking member.[50] In the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Select Committee on Ethics, however, the senior minority member is known as the vice chair.\\r\\nRecent criticisms of the Senate's operations object to what the critics argue is obsolescence as a result of partisan paralysis and a preponderance of arcane rules.[51][52]\\r\\nBills may be introduced in either chamber of Congress. However, the Constitution's Origination Clause provides that \\"All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives\\".[53] As a result, the Senate does not have the power to initiate bills imposing taxes. Furthermore, the House of Representatives holds that the Senate does not have the power to originate appropriation bills, or bills authorizing the expenditure of federal funds.[54][55][56] Historically, the Senate has disputed the interpretation advocated by the House. However, when the Senate originates an appropriations bill, the House simply refuses to consider it, thereby settling the dispute in practice. The constitutional provision barring the Senate from introducing revenue bills is based on the practice of the British Parliament, in which only the House of Commons may originate such measures.[57]\\r\\nAlthough the Constitution gave the House the power to initiate revenue bills, in practice the Senate is equal to the House in the respect of spending. As Woodrow Wilson wrote:\\r\\nThe Senate's right to amend general appropriation bills has been allowed the widest possible scope. The upper house may add to them what it pleases; may go altogether outside of their original provisions and tack to them entirely new features of legislation, altering not only the amounts but even the objects of expenditure, and making out of the materials sent them by the popular chamber measures of an almost totally new character.[58]\\r\\nThe approval of both houses is required for any bill, including a revenue bill, to become law. Both Houses must pass the same version of the bill; if there are differences, they may be resolved by sending amendments back and forth or by a conference committee, which includes members of both bodies.\\r\\nThe Constitution provides several unique functions for the Senate that form its ability to \\"check and balance\\" the powers of other elements of the Federal Government. These include the requirement that the Senate may advise and must consent to some of the president's government appointments; also the Senate must consent to all treaties with foreign governments; it tries all impeachments, and it elects the vice president in the event no person gets a majority of the electoral votes.\\r\\nThe president can make certain appointments only with the advice and consent of the Senate. Officials whose appointments require the Senate's approval include members of the Cabinet, heads of most federal executive agencies, ambassadors, Justices of the Supreme Court, and other federal judges. Under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, a large number of government appointments are subject to potential confirmation; however, Congress has passed legislation to authorize the appointment of many officials without the Senate's consent (usually, confirmation requirements are reserved for those officials with the most significant final decision-making authority). Typically, a nominee is first subject to a hearing before a Senate committee. Thereafter, the nomination is considered by the full Senate. The majority of nominees are confirmed, but in a small number of cases each year, Senate committees purposely fail to act on a nomination to block it. In addition, the president sometimes withdraws nominations when they appear unlikely to be confirmed. Because of this, outright rejections of nominees on the Senate floor are infrequent (there have been only nine Cabinet nominees rejected outright in United States history).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe powers of the Senate concerning nominations are, however, subject to some constraints. For instance, the Constitution provides that the president may make an appointment during a congressional recess without the Senate's advice and consent. The recess appointment remains valid only temporarily; the office becomes vacant again at the end of the next congressional session. Nevertheless, presidents have frequently used recess appointments to circumvent the possibility that the Senate may reject the nominee. Furthermore, as the Supreme Court held in Myers v. United States, although the Senate's advice and consent is required for the appointment of certain executive branch officials, it is not necessary for their removal.[59] Recess appointments have faced a significant amount of resistance and in 1960, the U.S. Senate passed a legally non-binding resolution against recess appointments.\\r\\nThe Senate also has a role in ratifying treaties. The Constitution provides that the president may only \\"make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur\\" in order to benefit from the Senate's advice and consent and give each state an equal vote in the process. However, not all international agreements are considered treaties under US domestic law, even if they are considered treaties under international law. Congress has passed laws authorizing the president to conclude executive agreements without action by the Senate. Similarly, the president may make congressional-executive agreements with the approval of a simple majority in each House of Congress, rather than a two-thirds majority in the Senate. Neither executive agreements nor congressional-executive agreements are mentioned in the Constitution, leading some scholars such as Laurence Tribe and John Yoo[60] to suggest that they unconstitutionally circumvent the treaty-ratification process. However, courts have upheld the validity of such agreements.[61]\\r\\nThe Constitution empowers the House of Representatives to impeach federal officials for \\"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors\\" and empowers the Senate to try such impeachments. If the sitting President of the United States is being tried, the Chief Justice of the United States presides over the trial. During an impeachment trial, senators are constitutionally required to sit on oath or affirmation. Conviction requires a two-thirds majority of the senators present. A convicted official is automatically removed from office; in addition, the Senate may stipulate that the defendant be banned from holding office. No further punishment is permitted during the impeachment proceedings; however, the party may face criminal penalties in a normal court of law.\\r\\nThe House of Representatives has impeached sixteen officials, of whom seven were convicted. (One resigned before the Senate could complete the trial.)[62] Only two presidents of the United States have ever been impeached: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Both trials ended in acquittal; in Johnson's case, the Senate fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority required for conviction.\\r\\nUnder the Twelfth Amendment, the Senate has the power to elect the vice president if no vice presidential candidate receives a majority of votes in the Electoral College. The Twelfth Amendment requires the Senate to choose from the two candidates with the highest numbers of electoral votes. Electoral College deadlocks are rare. The Senate has only broken a deadlock once; in 1837, it elected Richard Mentor Johnson. The House elects the president if the Electoral College deadlocks on that choice.\\r\\nThe party composition of the Senate during the 115th Congress:\\r\\nThe 115th United States Congress runs from January 3, 2017 to January 3, 2019.\\r\\nThe following are published by the Senate Historical Office.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 385326N 77032W? / ?38.89056N 77.00889W? / 38.89056; -77.00889","input":"How many u.s. senators are there and how long is a senator's term?"},{"output":"3 October 1942","context":"Space exploration is the discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by means of evolving and growing space technology. While the study of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, the physical exploration of space is conducted both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight.\\r\\nWhile the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.[1]\\r\\nSpace exploration has often been used as a proxy competition for geopolitical rivalries such as the Cold War. The early era of space exploration was driven by a \\"Space Race\\" between the Soviet Union and the United States. The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet Space Program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Aleksei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971. After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS).\\r\\nWith the substantial completion of the ISS[2] following STS-133 in March 2011, plans for space exploration by the U.S. remain in flux. Constellation, a Bush Administration program for a return to the Moon by 2020[3] was judged inadequately funded and unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009.[4] The Obama Administration proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), envisioning extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020, transferring the development of launch vehicles for human crews from NASA to the private sector, and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO, such as EarthÿMoon L1, the Moon, EarthÿSun L2, near-Earth asteroids, and Phobos or Mars orbit.[5]\\r\\nIn the 2000s, the People's Republic of China initiated a successful manned spaceflight program, while the European Union, Japan, and India have also planned future crewed space missions. China, Russia, Japan, and India have advocated crewed missions to the Moon during the 21st century, while the European Union has advocated manned missions to both the Moon and Mars during the 20th and 21st century.\\r\\nFrom the 1990s onwards, private interests began promoting space tourism and then public space exploration of the Moon (see Google Lunar X Prize).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest known projectiles prior to the rockets of the 1940s were the shells of the Paris Gun, a type of German long-range siege gun, which reached at least 40 kilometers altitude during World War One.[6] Steps towards putting a human-made object into space were taken by German scientists during World War II while testing the V-2 rocket, which became the first human-made object in space on 3 October 1942 with the launching of the A-4. After the war, the U.S. used German scientists and their captured rockets in programs for both military and civilian research. The first scientific exploration from space was the cosmic radiation experiment launched by the U.S. on a V-2 rocket on 10 May 1946.[7] The first images of Earth taken from space followed the same year[8][9] while the first animal experiment saw fruit flies lifted into space in 1947, both also on modified V-2s launched by Americans. Starting in 1947, the Soviets, also with the help of German teams, launched sub-orbital V-2 rockets and their own variant, the R-1, including radiation and animal experiments on some flights. These suborbital experiments only allowed a very short time in space which limited their usefulness.\\r\\nThe first successful orbital launch was of the Soviet uncrewed Sputnik 1 (\\"Satellite 1\\") mission on 4 October 1957. The satellite weighed about 83?kg (183?lb), and is believed to have orbited Earth at a height of about 250?km (160?mi). It had two radio transmitters (20 and 40?MHz), which emitted \\"beeps\\" that could be heard by radios around the globe. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere, while temperature and pressure data was encoded in the duration of radio beeps. The results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by a meteoroid. Sputnik 1 was launched by an R-7 rocket. It burned up upon re-entry on 3 January 1958.\\r\\nThe second one was Sputnik 2. Launched by the USSR on November 3, 1957, it carried the dog Laika, who became the first animal in orbit.\\r\\nThis success led to an escalation of the American space program, which unsuccessfully attempted to launch a Vanguard satellite into orbit two months later. On 31 January 1958, the U.S. successfully orbited Explorer 1 on a Juno rocket.\\r\\nThe first successful human spaceflight was Vostok 1 (\\"East 1\\"), carrying 27-year-old Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961. The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe, lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes. Gagarin's flight resonated around the world; it was a demonstration of the advanced Soviet space program and it opened an entirely new era in space exploration: human spaceflight.\\r\\nThe U.S. first launched a person into space within a month of Vostok 1 with Alan Shepard's suborbital flight on Freedom 7. Orbital flight was achieved by the United States when John Glenn's Friendship 7 orbited Earth on 20 February 1962.\\r\\nValentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space, orbited Earth 48 times aboard Vostok 6 on 16 June 1963.\\r\\nChina first launched a person into space 42 years after the launch of Vostok 1, on 15 October 2003, with the flight of Yang Liwei aboard the Shenzhou 5 (Divine Vessel 5) spacecraft.\\r\\nThe first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 in 1959.[10] The first automatic landing on another celestial body was performed by Luna 9[11] in 1966. Luna 10 became the first artificial satellite of the Moon.[12]\\r\\nThe first crewed landing on another celestial body was performed by Apollo 11 on 20 July 1969.\\r\\nThe first successful interplanetary flyby was the 1962 Mariner 2 flyby of Venus (closest approach 34,773 kilometers). The other planets were first flown by in 1965 for Mars by Mariner 4, 1973 for Jupiter by Pioneer 10, 1974 for Mercury by Mariner 10, 1979 for Saturn by Pioneer 11, 1986 for Uranus by Voyager 2, 1989 for Neptune by Voyager 2. In 2015, the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto were orbited by Dawn and passed by New Horizons, respectively.\\r\\nThe first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing of Venera 7 on Venus which returned data to Earth for 23 minutes. In 1975 the Venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet. In 1971 the Mars 3 mission achieved the first soft landing on Mars returning data for almost 20 seconds. Later much longer duration surface missions were achieved, including over six years of Mars surface operation by Viking 1 from 1975 to 1982 and over two hours of transmission from the surface of Venus by Venera 13 in 1982, the longest ever Soviet planetary surface mission.\\r\\nThe dream of stepping into the outer reaches of Earth's atmosphere was driven by the fiction of Peter Francis Geraci[13][14][15] and H. G. Wells,[16] and rocket technology was developed to try to realize this vision. The German V-2 was the first rocket to travel into space, overcoming the problems of thrust and material failure. During the final days of World War II this technology was obtained by both the Americans and Soviets as were its designers. The initial driving force for further development of the technology was a weapons race for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) to be used as long-range carriers for fast nuclear weapon delivery, but in 1961 when the Soviet Union launched the first man into space, the United States declared itself to be in a \\"Space Race\\" with the Soviets.\\r\\nKonstantin Tsiolkovsky, Robert Goddard, Hermann Oberth, and Reinhold Tiling laid the groundwork of rocketry in the early years of the 20th century.\\r\\nWernher von Braun was the lead rocket engineer for Nazi Germany's World War II V-2 rocket project. In the last days of the war he led a caravan of workers in the German rocket program to the American lines, where they surrendered and were brought to the United States to work on their rocket development (\\"Operation Paperclip\\"). He acquired American citizenship and led the team that developed and launched Explorer 1, the first American satellite. Von Braun later led the team at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center which developed the Saturn V moon rocket.\\r\\nInitially the race for space was often led by Sergei Korolyov, whose legacy includes both the R7 and Soyuzwhich remain in service to this day. Korolev was the mastermind behind the first satellite, first man (and first woman) in orbit and first spacewalk. Until his death his identity was a closely guarded state secret; not even his mother knew that he was responsible for creating the Soviet space program.\\r\\nKerim Kerimov was one of the founders of the Soviet space program and was one of the lead architects behind the first human spaceflight (Vostok 1) alongside Sergey Korolyov. After Korolyov's death in 1966, Kerimov became the lead scientist of the Soviet space program and was responsible for the launch of the first space stations from 1971 to 1991, including the Salyut and Mir series, and their precursors in 1967, the Cosmos 186 and Cosmos 188.[17][18]\\r\\nAlthough the Sun will probably not be physically explored at all, the study of the Sun has nevertheless been a major focus of space exploration. Being above the atmosphere in particular and Earth's magnetic field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations that cannot reach Earth's surface. The Sun generates most space weather, which can affect power generation and transmission systems on Earth and interfere with, and even damage, satellites and space probes. Numerous spacecraft dedicated to observing the Sun, beginning with the Apollo Telescope Mount, have been launched and still others have had solar observation as a secondary objective. Parker Solar Probe, planned for a 2018 launch, will approach the Sun to within 1/8th the orbit of Mercury.\\r\\nMercury remains the least explored of the Terrestrial planets. As of May 2013, the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER missions have been the only missions that have made close observations of Mercury. MESSENGER entered orbit around Mercury in March 2011, to further investigate the observations made by Mariner 10 in 1975 (Munsell, 2006b).\\r\\nA third mission to Mercury, scheduled to arrive in 2025, BepiColombo is to include two probes. BepiColombo is a joint mission between Japan and the European Space Agency. MESSENGER and BepiColombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by Mariner 10's flybys.\\r\\nFlights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or delta-v. Due to the relatively high delta-v to reach Mercury and its proximity to the Sun, it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable.\\r\\nVenus was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and, despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the Solar System, has had more landers sent to it (nearly all from the Soviet Union) than any other planet in the Solar System. The first successful Venus flyby was the American Mariner 2 spacecraft, which flew past Venus in 1962. Mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial bodies. In 1967 Venera 4 became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of Venus. In 1970, Venera 7 became the first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data. Starting in 1975 with the Soviet orbiter Venera 9 some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to Venus, including later missions which were able to map the surface of Venus using radar to pierce the obscuring atmosphere.\\r\\nSpace exploration has been used as a tool to understand Earth as a celestial object in its own right. Orbital missions can provide data for Earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely ground-based point of reference.\\r\\nFor example, the existence of the Van Allen radiation belts was unknown until their discovery by the United States' first artificial satellite, Explorer 1. These belts contain radiation trapped by Earth's magnetic fields, which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000?km impractical. Following this early unexpected discovery, a large number of Earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore Earth from a space based perspective. These satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of Earth-based phenomena. For instance, the hole in the ozone layer was found by an artificial satellite that was exploring Earth's atmosphere, and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify.\\r\\nThe Moon was the first celestial body to be the object of space exploration. It holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial object to be flown by, orbited, and landed upon by spacecraft, and the only remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans.\\r\\nIn 1959 the Soviets obtained the first images of the far side of the Moon, never previously visible to humans. The U.S. exploration of the Moon began with the Ranger 4 impactor in 1962. Starting in 1966 the Soviets successfully deployed a number of landers to the Moon which were able to obtain data directly from the Moon's surface; just four months later, Surveyor 1 marked the debut of a successful series of U.S. landers. The Soviet uncrewed missions culminated in the Lunokhod program in the early 1970s, which included the first uncrewed rovers and also successfully brought lunar soil samples to Earth for study. This marked the first (and to date the only) automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to Earth. Uncrewed exploration of the Moon continues with various nations periodically deploying lunar orbiters, and in 2008 the Indian Moon Impact Probe.\\r\\nCrewed exploration of the Moon began in 1968 with the Apollo 8 mission that successfully orbited the Moon, the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans. In 1969, the Apollo 11 mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world. Crewed exploration of the Moon did not continue for long, however. The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 marked the most recent human visit there, and the next, Exploration Mission 2, is due to orbit the Moon in 2021. Robotic missions are still pursued vigorously.\\r\\nThe exploration of Mars has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the Soviet Union (later Russia), the United States, Europe, Japan and India. Dozens of robotic spacecraft, including orbiters, landers, and rovers, have been launched toward Mars since the 1960s. These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the red planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of Earth.\\r\\nThe exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their missions, with some failing before they even began. Such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey, and has led researchers to jokingly speak of The Great Galactic Ghoul[20] which subsists on a diet of Mars probes. This phenomenon is also informally known as the \\"Mars Curse\\".[21] In contrast to overall high failure rates in the exploration of Mars, India has become the first country to achieve success of its maiden attempt. India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM)[22][23][24] is one of the least expensive interplanetary missions ever undertaken with an approximate total cost of ?450 Crore (US$73 million).[25][26] The first mission to Mars by any Arab country has been taken up by the United Arab Emirates. Called the Emirates Mars Mission, it is scheduled for launch in 2020. The uncrewed exploratory probe has been named \\"Hope Probe\\" and will be sent to Mars to study its atmosphere in detail.[27]\\r\\nThe Russian space mission Fobos-Grunt, which launched on 9 November 2011 experienced a failure leaving it stranded in low Earth orbit.[28] It was to begin exploration of the Phobos and Martian circumterrestrial orbit, and study whether the moons of Mars, or at least Phobos, could be a \\"trans-shipment point\\" for spaceships traveling to Mars.[29]\\r\\nThe exploration of Jupiter has consisted solely of a number of automated NASA spacecraft visiting the planet since 1973. A large majority of the missions have been \\"flybys\\", in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit; such as in Pioneer and Voyager programs. The Galileo and Juno spacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planet's orbit. As Jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface, a landing mission is nearly impossible.\\r\\nReaching Jupiter from Earth requires a delta-v of 9.2?km/s,[30] which is comparable to the 9.7?km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit.[31] Fortunately, gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach Jupiter, albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration.[30]\\r\\nJupiter has 69 known moons, many of which have relatively little known information about them.\\r\\nSaturn has been explored only through uncrewed spacecraft launched by NASA, including one mission (CassiniÿHuygens) planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies. These missions consist of flybys in 1979 by Pioneer 11, in 1980 by Voyager 1, in 1982 by Voyager 2 and an orbital mission by the Cassini spacecraft, which lasted from 2004 until 2017.\\r\\nSaturn has at least 62 known moons, although the exact number is debatable since Saturn's rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying sizes. The largest of the moons is Titan, which holds the distinction of being the only moon in the Solar System with an atmosphere denser and thicker than that of Earth. Titan holds the distinction of being the only object in the Outer Solar System that has been explored with a lander, the Huygens probe deployed by the Cassini spacecraft.\\r\\nThe exploration of Uranus has been entirely through the Voyager 2 spacecraft, with no other visits currently planned. Given its axial tilt of 97.77, with its polar regions exposed to sunlight or darkness for long periods, scientists were not sure what to expect at Uranus. The closest approach to Uranus occurred on 24 January 1986. Voyager 2 studied the planet's unique atmosphere and magnetosphere. Voyager 2 also examined its ring system and the moons of Uranus including all five of the previously known moons, while discovering an additional ten previously unknown moons.\\r\\nImages of Uranus proved to have a very uniform appearance, with no evidence of the dramatic storms or atmospheric banding evident on Jupiter and Saturn. Great effort was required to even identify a few clouds in the images of the planet. The magnetosphere of Uranus, however, proved to be completely unique and proved to be profoundly affected by the planet's unusual axial tilt. In contrast to the bland appearance of Uranus itself, striking images were obtained of the Moons of Uranus, including evidence that Miranda had been unusually geologically active.\\r\\nThe exploration of Neptune began with the 25 August 1989 Voyager 2 flyby, the sole visit to the system as of 2014. The possibility of a Neptune Orbiter has been discussed, but no other missions have been given serious thought.\\r\\nAlthough the extremely uniform appearance of Uranus during Voyager 2's visit in 1986 had led to expectations that Neptune would also have few visible atmospheric phenomena, the spacecraft found that Neptune had obvious banding, visible clouds, auroras, and even a conspicuous anticyclone storm system rivaled in size only by Jupiter's small Spot. Neptune also proved to have the fastest winds of any planet in the Solar System, measured as high as 2,100?km/h.[32] Voyager 2 also examined Neptune's ring and moon system. It discovered 900 complete rings and additional partial ring \\"arcs\\" around Neptune. In addition to examining Neptune's three previously known moons, Voyager 2 also discovered five previously unknown moons, one of which, Proteus, proved to be the last largest moon in the system. Data from Voyager 2 supported the view that Neptune's largest moon, Triton, is a captured Kuiper belt object.[33]\\r\\nThe dwarf planet Pluto presents significant challenges for spacecraft because of its great distance from Earth (requiring high velocity for reasonable trip times) and small mass (making capture into orbit very difficult at present). Voyager 1 could have visited Pluto, but controllers opted instead for a close flyby of Saturn's moon Titan, resulting in a trajectory incompatible with a Pluto flyby. Voyager 2 never had a plausible trajectory for reaching Pluto.[34]\\r\\nPluto continues to be of great interest, despite its reclassification as the lead and nearest member of a new and growing class of distant icy bodies of intermediate size (and also the first member of the important subclass, defined by orbit and known as \\"plutinos\\"). After an intense political battle, a mission to Pluto dubbed New Horizons was granted funding from the United States government in 2003.[35] New Horizons was launched successfully on 19 January 2006. In early 2007 the craft made use of a gravity assist from Jupiter. Its closest approach to Pluto was on 14 July 2015; scientific observations of Pluto began five months prior to closest approach and continued for 16 days after the encounter.\\r\\nUntil the advent of space travel, objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes, their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery. Several asteroids have now been visited by probes, the first of which was Galileo, which flew past two: 951 Gaspra in 1991, followed by 243 Ida in 1993. Both of these lay near enough to Galileo's planned trajectory to Jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost. The first landing on an asteroid was performed by the NEAR Shoemaker probe in 2000, following an orbital survey of the object. The dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroid 4 Vesta, two of the three largest asteroids, were visited by NASA's Dawn spacecraft, launched in 2007.\\r\\nAlthough many comets have been studied from Earth sometimes with centuries-worth of observations, only a few comets have been closely visited. In 1985, the International Cometary Explorer conducted the first comet fly-by (21P/Giacobini-Zinner) before joining the Halley Armada studying the famous comet. The Deep Impact probe smashed into 9P/Tempel to learn more about its structure and composition and the Stardust mission returned samples of another comet's tail. The Philae lander successfully landed on Comet ChuryumovÿGerasimenko in 2014 as part of the broader Rosetta mission.\\r\\nHayabusa was an unmanned spacecraft developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to return a sample of material from the small near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa to Earth for further analysis. Hayabusa was launched on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in mid-September 2005. After arriving at Itokawa, Hayabusa studied the asteroid's shape, spin, topography, color, composition, density, and history. In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid to collect samples. The spacecraft returned to Earth on 13 June 2010.\\r\\nDeep space exploration is the branch of astronomy, astronautics and space technology that is involved with the exploration of distant regions of outer space.[36] Physical exploration of space is conducted both by human spaceflights (deep-space astronautics) and by robotic spacecraft.\\r\\nSome of the best candidates for future deep space engine technologies include anti-matter, nuclear power and beamed propulsion.[37] The latter, beamed propulsion, appears to be the best candidate for deep space exploration presently available, since it uses known physics and known technology that is being developed for other purposes.[38]\\r\\nIn the 2000s, several plans for space exploration were announced; both government entities and the private sector have space exploration objectives. China has announced plans to have a 60-ton multi-module space station in orbit by 2020.\\r\\nThe NASA Authorization Act of 2010 provided a re-prioritized list of objectives for the American space program, as well as funding for the first priorities. NASA proposes to move forward with the development of the Space Launch System (SLS), which will be designed to carry the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, as well as important cargo, equipment, and science experiments to Earth's orbit and destinations beyond. Additionally, the SLS will serve as a back up for commercial and international partner transportation services to the International Space Station. The SLS rocket will incorporate technological investments from the Space Shuttle program and the Constellation program in order to take advantage of proven hardware and reduce development and operations costs. The first developmental flight is targeted for the end of 2017.[39]\\r\\nThe idea of using high level automated systems for space missions has become a desirable goal to space agencies all around the world. Such systems are believed to yield benefits such as lower cost, less human oversight, and ability to explore deeper in space which is usually restricted by long communications with human controllers.[40]\\r\\nAutonomy is defined by three requirements:[40]\\r\\nAutonomous technologies would be able to perform beyond predetermined actions. They would analyze all possible states and events happening around them and come up with a safe response. In addition, such technologies can reduce launch cost and ground involvement. Performance would increase as well. Autonomy would be able to quickly respond upon encountering an unforeseen event, especially in deep space exploration where communication back to Earth would take too long.[40]\\r\\nNASA began its autonomous science experiment (ASE) on Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) which is NASA's first satellite in the new millennium program Earth-observing series launched on 21 November 2000. The autonomy of ASE is capable of on-board science analysis, replanning, robust execution, and later the addition of model-based diagnostic. Images obtained by the EO-1 are analyzed on-board and downlinked when a change or an interesting event occur. The ASE software has successfully provided over 10,000 science images.[40]\\r\\nAn article in science magazine Nature suggested the use of asteroids as a gateway for space exploration, with the ultimate destination being Mars.[41] In order to make such an approach viable, three requirements need to be fulfilled: first, \\"a thorough asteroid survey to find thousands of nearby bodies suitable for astronauts to visit\\"; second, \\"extending flight duration and distance capability to ever-increasing ranges out to Mars\\"; and finally, \\"developing better robotic vehicles and tools to enable astronauts to explore an asteroid regardless of its size, shape or spin.\\"[41] Furthermore, using asteroids would provide astronauts with protection from galactic cosmic rays, with mission crews being able to land on them in times of greater risk to radiation exposure.[42]\\r\\nThe research that is conducted by national space exploration agencies, such as NASA and Roscosmos, is one of the reasons supporters cite to justify government expenses. Economic analyses of the NASA programs often showed ongoing economic benefits (such as NASA spin-offs), generating many times the revenue of the cost of the program.[43] It is also argued that space exploration would lead to the extraction of resources on other planets and especially asteroids, which contain billions of dollars worth of minerals and metals. Such expeditions could generate a lot of revenue.[44] As well, it has been argued that space exploration programs help inspire youth to study in science and engineering.[45]\\r\\nAnother claim is that space exploration is a necessity to mankind and that staying on Earth will lead to extinction. Some of the reasons are lack of natural resources, comets, nuclear war, and worldwide epidemic. Stephen Hawking, renowned British theoretical physicist, said that \\"I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I'm an optimist. We will reach out to the stars.\\"[46]\\r\\nNASA has produced a series of public service announcement videos supporting the concept of space exploration.[47]\\r\\nOverall, the public remains largely supportive of both crewed and uncrewed space exploration. According to an Associated Press Poll conducted in July 2003, 71% of U.S. citizens agreed with the statement that the space program is \\"a good investment\\", compared to 21% who did not.[48]\\r\\nArthur C. Clarke (1950) presented a summary of motivations for the human exploration of space in his non-fiction semi-technical monograph Interplanetary Flight.[49] He argued that humanity's choice is essentially between expansion off Earth into space, versus cultural (and eventually biological) stagnation and death.\\r\\nSpaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space.\\r\\nSpaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories, reconnaissance satellites and other Earth observation satellites.\\r\\nA spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraftboth when unpropelled and when under propulsionis covered by the area of study called astrodynamics. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.\\r\\nSatellites are used for a large number of purposes. Common types include military (spy) and civilian Earth observation satellites, communication satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and research satellites. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites.\\r\\nCurrent examples of the commercial use of space include satellite navigation systems, satellite television and satellite radio. Space tourism is the recent phenomenon of space travel by individuals for the purpose of personal pleasure.\\r\\nPrivate spaceflight companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, and commercial space stations such as the Axiom Space and the Bigelow Commercial Space Station have dramatically changed the landscape of space exploration, and will continue to do so in the near future.\\r\\nAstrobiology is the interdisciplinary study of life in the universe, combining aspects of astronomy, biology and geology.[50] It is focused primarily on the study of the origin, distribution and evolution of life. It is also known as exobiology (from Greek: ?, exo, \\"outside\\").[51][52][53] The term \\"Xenobiology\\" has been used as well, but this is technically incorrect because its terminology means \\"biology of the foreigners\\".[54] Astrobiologists must also consider the possibility of life that is chemically entirely distinct from any life found on Earth.[55] In the Solar System some of the prime locations for current or past astrobiology are on Enceladus, Europa, Mars, and Titan.[56]\\r\\nSpace colonization, also called space settlement and space humanization, would be the permanent autonomous (self-sufficient) human habitation of locations outside Earth, especially of natural satellites or planets such as the Moon or Mars, using significant amounts of in-situ resource utilization.\\r\\nTo date, the longest human occupation of space is the International Space Station which has been in continuous use for 17?years, 229?days. Valeri Polyakov's record single spaceflight of almost 438 days aboard the Mir space station has not been surpassed. Long-term stays in space reveal issues with bone and muscle loss in low gravity, immune system suppression, and radiation exposure.\\r\\nMany past and current concepts for the continued exploration and colonization of space focus on a return to the Moon as a \\"stepping stone\\" to the other planets, especially Mars. At the end of 2006 NASA announced they were planning to build a permanent Moon base with continual presence by 2024.[57]\\r\\nBeyond the technical factors that could make living in space more widespread, it has been suggested that the lack of private property, the inability or difficulty in establishing property rights in space, has been an impediment to the development of space for human habitation. Since the advent of space technology in the latter half of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky, with strong arguments both for and against. In particular, the making of national territorial claims in outer space and on celestial bodies has been specifically proscribed by the Outer Space Treaty, which had been, as of 2012[update], ratified by all spacefaring nations.[58]\\r\\nSolar System?L Local Interstellar Cloud?L Local Bubble?L Gould Belt?L Orion Arm?L Milky Way?L Milky Way subgroup?L Local Group?L Virgo Supercluster?L Laniakea Supercluster?L Observable universe?L Universe\\r\\nEach arrow (L) may be read as \\"within\\" or \\"part of\\".","input":"When was the first manmade object sent into space?"},{"output":"630 retail outlets, 7900 parking spaces, over 100 restaurants & Cafes, 80 luxury stores and 250 flagship stores","context":"Mall of the Emirates (Arabic: ??? ?????????) is a shopping mall in Dubai.

Gebhard, in a medical malpractice United States court case in 1957","context":"Informed consent is a process for getting permission before conducting a healthcare intervention on a person, or for disclosing personal information. A health care provider may ask a patient to consent to receive therapy before providing it, or a clinical researcher may ask a research participant before enrolling that person into a clinical trial. Informed consent is collected according to guidelines from the fields of medical ethics and research ethics.\\r\\nAn informed consent can be said to have been given based upon a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and consequences of an action. Adequate informed consent is rooted in respecting a persons dignity.[1] To give informed consent, the individual concerned must have adequate reasoning faculties and be in possession of all relevant facts. Impairments to reasoning and judgment that may prevent informed consent include basic intellectual or emotional immaturity, high levels of stress such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a severe intellectual disability, severe mental disorder, intoxication, severe sleep deprivation, Alzheimer's disease, or being in a coma.\\r\\nObtaining informed consent is not always required. If an individual is considered unable to give informed consent, another person is generally authorized to give consent on his behalf, e.g., parents or legal guardians of a child (though in this circumstance the child may be required to provide informed assent) and conservators for the mentally disordered, or consent can be assumed through the doctrine of implied consent, e.g., when an unconscious person will die without immediate medical treatment.\\r\\nIn cases where an individual is provided insufficient information to form a reasoned decision, serious ethical issues arise. Such cases in a clinical trial in medical research are anticipated and prevented by an ethics committee or Institutional Review Board.\\r\\nInformed Consent Form Templates can be found on the World Health Organization Website for practical use.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInformed consent can be complex to evaluate, because neither expressions of consent, nor expressions of understanding of implications, necessarily mean that full adult consent was in fact given, nor that full comprehension of relevant issues is internally digested. Consent may be implied within the usual subtleties of human communication, rather than explicitly negotiated verbally or in writing. In some cases consent cannot legally be possible, even if the person protests he does indeed understand and wish. There are also structured instruments for evaluating capacity to give informed consent, although no ideal instrument presently exists.[citation needed]\\r\\nThus, there is always a degree to which informed consent must be assumed or inferred based upon observation, or knowledge, or legal reliance. This especially is the case in sexual or relational issues. In medical or formal circumstances, explicit agreement by means of signaturenormally relied on legallyregardless of actual consent, is the norm. This is the case with certain procedures, such as a \\"do not resuscitate\\" directive that a patient signed prior to their illness.[citation needed]\\r\\nBrief examples of each of the above:\\r\\nFor an individual to give valid informed consent, three components must be present: disclosure, capacity and voluntariness.[3][4]\\r\\nWaiver of the consent requirement may be applied in certain circumstances where no foreseeable harm is expected to result from the study or when permitted by law, federal regulations, or if an ethical review committee has approved the non-disclosure of certain information.[5]\\r\\nBesides studies with minimal risk, waivers of consent may be obtained in a military setting. According to 10 USC 980, the United States Code for the Armed Forces, Limitations on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects, a waiver of advanced informed consent may be granted by the Secretary of Defense if a research project would:[6]\\r\\nWhile informed consent is a basic right and should be carried out effectively, if a patient is incapacitated due to injury or illness, it is still important that patients benefit from emergency experimentation.[7] The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) joined together to create federal guidelines to permit emergency research, without informed consent.[7] However, they can only proceed with the research if they obtain a waiver of informed consent (WIC) or an emergency exception from informed consent (EFIC).[7]\\r\\nInformed consent is a technical term first used by attorney, Paul G. Gebhard, in a medical malpractice United States court case in 1957.[8] In tracing its history, some scholars have suggested tracing the history of checking for any of these practices:[9]:54\\r\\nThese practices are part of what constitutes informed consent, and their history is the history of informed consent.[9]:60 They combine to form the modern concept of informed consentwhich rose in response to particular incidents in modern research.[9]:60 Whereas various cultures in various places practiced informed consent, the modern concept of informed consent was developed by people who drew influence from Western tradition.[9]:60\\r\\nHistorians cite a series of medical guidelines to trace the history of informed consent in medical practice.\\r\\nThe Hippocratic Oath, a 500?BC Greek text, was the first set of Western writings giving guidelines for the conduct of medical professionals. It advises that physicians conceal most information from patients to give the patients the best care.[9]:61 The rationale is a beneficence model for carethe doctor knows better than the patient, and therefore should direct the patient's care, because the patient is not likely to have better ideas than the doctor.[9]:61\\r\\nHenri de Mondeville, a French surgeon who in the 14th century, wrote about medical practice. He traced his ideas to the Hippocratic Oath.[9]:63[10][11] Among his recommendations were that doctors \\"promise a cure to every patient\\" in hopes that the good prognosis would inspire a good outcome to treatment.[9]:63 Mondeville never mentioned getting consent, but did emphasize the need for the patient to have confidence in the doctor.[9]:63 He also advised that when deciding therapeutically unimportant details the doctor should meet the patients' requests \\"so far as they do not interfere with treatment\\".[12]\\r\\nBenjamin Rush was an 18th-century United States physician who was influenced by the Age of Enlightenment cultural movement.[9]:65 Because of this, he advised that doctors ought to share as much information as possible with patients. He recommended that doctors educate the public and respect a patient's informed decision to accept therapy.[9]:65 There is no evidence that he supported seeking a consent from patients.[9]:65 In a lecture titled \\"On the duties of patients to their physicians\\", he stated that patients should be strictly obedient to the physician's orders; this was representative of much of his writings.[9]:65 John Gregory, Rush's teacher, wrote similar views that a doctor could best practice beneficence by making decisions for the patients without their consent.[9]:66[13]\\r\\nThomas Percival was a British physician who published a book called Medical Ethics in 1803.[9]:68 Percival was a student of the works of Gregory and various earlier Hippocratic physicians.[9]:68 Like all previous works, Percival's Medical Ethics makes no mention of soliciting for the consent of patients or respecting their decisions.[9]:68 Percival said that patients have a right to truth, but when the physician could provide better treatment by lying or withholding information, he advised that the physician do as he thought best.[9]:68\\r\\nWhen the American Medical Association was founded they in 1847 produced a work called the first edition of the American Medical Association Code of Medical Ethics.[9]:69 Many sections of this book are verbatim copies of passages from Percival's Medical Ethics.[9]:69 A new concept in this book was the idea that physicians should fully disclose all patient details truthfully when talking to other physicians, but the text does not also apply this idea to disclosing information to patients.[9]:70 Through this text, Percival's ideas became pervasive guidelines throughout the United States as other texts were derived from them.[9]:70\\r\\nWorthington Hooker was an American physician who in 1849 published Physician and Patient.[9]:70 This medical ethics book was radical demonstrating understanding of the AMA's guidelines and Percival's philosophy and soundly rejecting all directives that a doctor should lie to patients.[9]:70 In Hooker's view, benevolent deception is not fair to the patient, and he lectured widely on this topic.[9]:70 Hooker's ideas were not broadly influential.[9]:70\\r\\nHistorians cite a series of human subject research experiments to trace the history of informed consent in research.\\r\\nThe U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission is considered the first research group in history to use consent forms.[14] In 1900, Major Walter Reed was appointed head of the four man U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission in Cuba that determined mosquitoes were the vector for yellow fever transmission. His earliest experiments were probably done without formal documentation of informed consent. In later experiments he obtained support from appropriate military and administrative authorities. He then drafted what is now one of the oldest series of extant informed consent documents.[15] The three surviving examples are in Spanish with English translations; two have an individuals signature and one is marked with an X.[16]\\r\\nTearoom Trade is the name of a book by American psychologist Laud Humphreys. In it he describes his research into male homosexual acts.[17] In conducting this research he never sought consent from his research subjects and other researchers raised concerns that he violated the right to privacy for research participants.[17]\\r\\nThe Milgram experiment is the name of a 1961 experiment conducted by American psychologist Stanley Milgram. In the experiment Milgram had an authority figure order research participants to commit a disturbing act of harming another person.[18] After the experiment he would reveal that he had deceived the participants and that they had not hurt anyone, but the research participants were upset at the experience of having participated in the research.[18] The experiment raised broad discussion on the ethics of recruiting participants for research without giving them full information about the nature of the research.[18]\\r\\nChester M. Southam used HeLa cells to inject into cancer patients and Ohio State Penitentiary inmates without informed consent to determine if people could become immune to cancer and if cancer could be transmitted.[19]\\r\\nThe doctrine of informed consent relates to professional negligence and establishes a breach of the duty of care owed to the patient (see duty of care, breach of the duty, and respect for persons). The doctrine of informed consent also has significant implications for medical trials of medications, devices, or procedures.\\r\\nUntil 2015 in the United Kingdom and in countries such as Malaysia and Singapore, informed consent in medical procedures requires proof as to the standard of care to expect as a recognised standard of acceptable professional practice (the Bolam Test), that is, what risks would a medical professional usually disclose in the circumstances (see Loss of right in English law). Arguably, this is \\"sufficient consent\\" rather than \\"informed consent.\\" The UK has since departed from the Bolam test for judging standards of informed consent, due to the landmark ruling in Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board. This moves away from the concept of a reasonable physician and instead uses the standard of a reasonable patient, and what risks an individual would attach significance to.\\r\\nMedicine in the United States, Australia, and Canada also takes this patient-centric approach to \\"informed consent.\\" Informed consent in these jurisdictions requires healthcare providers to disclose significant risks, as well as risks of particular importance to that patient. This approach combines an objective (a hypothetical reasonable patient) and subjective (this particular patient) approach.\\r\\nThe doctrine of informed consent should be contrasted with the general doctrine of medical consent, which applies to assault or battery. The consent standard here is only that the person understands, in general terms, the nature of and purpose of the intended intervention. As the higher standard of informed consent applies to negligence, not battery, the other elements of negligence must be made out. Significantly, causation must be shown: That had the individual been made aware of the risk he would not have proceeded with the operation (or perhaps with that surgeon).\\r\\nOptimal establishment of an informed consent requires adaptation to cultural or other individual factors of the patient. For example, people from Mediterranean and Arab appear to rely more on the context of the delivery of the information, with the information being carried more by who is saying it and where, when, and how it's being said, rather than what is said, which is of relatively more importance in typical \\"Western\\" countries.[20]\\r\\nThe informed consent doctrine is generally implemented through good healthcare practice: pre-operation discussions with patients and the use of medical consent forms in hospitals. However, reliance on a signed form should not undermine the basis of the doctrine in giving the patient an opportunity to weigh and respond to the risk. In one British case, a doctor performing routine surgery on a woman noticed that she had cancerous tissue in her womb. He took the initiative to remove the woman's womb; however, as she had not given informed consent for this operation, the doctor was judged by the General Medical Council to have acted negligently. The council stated that the woman should have been informed of her condition, and allowed to make her own decision.\\r\\nTo capture and manage informed consents, hospital management systems typically use paper-based consent forms which are scanned and stored in a document handling system after obtaining the necessary signatures. Hospital systems and research organizations are adopting an electronic way of capturing informed consents to enable indexing, to improve comprehension, search and retrieval of consent data, thus enhancing the ability to honor to patient intent and identify willing research participants.[21][22][23][24] More recently, Health Sciences South Carolina, a statewide research collaborative focused on transforming healthcare quality, health information systems and patient outcomes, developed an open-source system called Research Permissions Management System (RPMS).[25][26]\\r\\nThe ability to give informed consent is governed by a general requirement of competency. In common law jurisdictions, adults are presumed competent to consent. This presumption can be rebutted, for instance, in circumstances of mental illness or other incompetence. This may be prescribed in legislation or based on a common-law standard of inability to understand the nature of the procedure. In cases of incompetent adults, a health care proxy makes medical decisions. In the absence of a proxy, the medical practitioner is expected to act in the patient's best interests until a proxy can be found.\\r\\nBy contrast, 'minors' (which may be defined differently in different jurisdictions) are generally presumed incompetent to consent, but depending on their age and other factors may be required to provide Informed assent. In some jurisdictions (e.g. much of the U.S.), this is a strict standard. In other jurisdictions (e.g. England, Australia, Canada), this presumption may be rebutted through proof that the minor is mature (the Gillick standard). In cases of incompetent minors, informed consent is usually required from the parent (rather than the 'best interests standard') although a parens patriae order may apply, allowing the court to dispense with parental consent in cases of refusal.\\r\\nResearch involving deception is controversial given the requirement for informed consent. Deception typically arises in social psychology, when researching a particular psychological process requires that investigators deceive subjects. For example, in the Milgram experiment, researchers wanted to determine the willingness of participants to obey authority figures despite their personal conscientious objections. They had authority figures demand that participants deliver what they thought was an electric shock to another research participant. For the study to succeed, it was necessary to deceive the participants so they believed that the subject was a peer and that their electric shocks caused the peer actual pain.\\r\\nNonetheless, research involving deception prevents the subject/patient from exercising his/her basic right of autonomous informed decision-making and conflicts with the ethical principle of respect for persons.\\r\\nThe Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct set by the American Psychological Association says that psychologists may not conduct research that includes a deceptive compartment unless they can justify the act by the value and importance of the study's results, and show they couldn't obtain the results by some other way. Moreover, the research should bear no potential harm to the subject as an outcome of deception, be it physical pain or emotional distress. Finally, the code requires a debriefing session, in which the experimenter tells the subject about the deception, and gives subjects the option of withdrawing their data.[27]\\r\\nIn some U.S. states, informed consent laws (sometimes called \\"right to know\\" laws) require that a woman seeking an elective abortion receive information from the abortion provider about her legal rights, alternatives to abortion (such as adoption), available public and private assistance, and other information specified in the law, before the abortion is performed. Other countries with such laws (e.g. Germany) require that the information giver be properly certified to make sure that no abortion is carried out for the financial gain of the abortion provider and to ensure that the decision to have an abortion is not swayed by any form of incentive.[28][29]\\r\\nSome informed consent laws have been criticized for allegedly using \\"loaded language in an apparently deliberate attempt to 'personify' the fetus,\\"[30] but those critics acknowledge that \\"most of the information in the [legally mandated] materials about abortion comports with recent scientific findings and the principles of informed consent\\", although \\"some content is either misleading or altogether incorrect.\\"[31]\\r\\nAs children often lack the decision making ability or legal power (competence) to provide true informed consent for medical decisions, it often falls on parents or legal guardians to provide informed permission for medical decisions. This \\"consent by proxy\\" usually works reasonably well, but can lead to ethical dilemmas when the judgment of the parents or guardians and the medical professional differ with regard to what constitutes appropriate decisions \\"in the best interest of the child\\". Children who are legally emancipated, and certain situations such as decisions regarding sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy, or for unemancipated minors who are deemed to have medical decision making capacity, may be able to provide consent without the need for parental permission depending on the laws of the jurisdiction the child lives in. The American Academy of Pediatrics encourages medical professionals also to seek the assent of older children and adolescents by providing age appropriate information to these children to help empower them in the decision making process.[32]\\r\\nResearch on children has benefited society in many ways. The only effective way to establish normal patterns of growth and metabolism is to do research on infants and young children. When addressing the issue of informed consent with children, the primary response is parental consent. This is valid, although only legal guardians are able to consent for a child, not adult siblings.[33] Additionally, parents may not order the termination of a treatment that is required to keep a child alive, even if they feel it is in the best interest.[33] Guardians are typically involved in the consent of children, however a number of doctrines have developed that allow children to receive health treatments without parental consent. For example, emancipated minors may consent to medical treatment, and minors can also consent in an emergency.[33]\\r\\nInformed consent is part of the ethical clinical research as well, in which a human subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular clinical trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate. Informed consent is documented by means of a written, signed, and dated informed consent form.[34] In medical research, the Nuremberg Code set a base international standard in 1947, which continued to develop, for example in response to the ethical violation in the Holocaust. Nowadays, medical research is overseen by an ethics committee that also oversees the informed consent process.\\r\\nAs the medical guidelines established in the Nuremberg Code were imported into the ethical guidelines for the social sciences, informed consent became a common part of the research procedure.[35] However, while informed consent is the default in medical settings, it is not always required in the social science. Here, research often involves low or no risk for participants, unlike in many medical experiments. Second, the mere knowledge that they participate in a study can cause people to alter their behavior, as in the Hawthorne Effect: \\"In the typical lab experiment, subjects enter an environment in which they are keenly aware that their behavior is being monitored, recorded, and subsequently scrutinized.\\"[36]:168 In such cases, seeking informed consent directly interferes with the ability to conduct the research, because the very act of revealing that a study is being conducted is likely to alter the behavior studied. List exemplifies the potential dilemma that can result: \\"if one were interested in exploring whether, and to what extent, race or gender influences the prices that buyers pay for used cars, it would be difficult to measure accurately the degree of discrimination among used car dealers who know that they are taking part in an experiment.\\"[37] In cases where such interference is likely, and after careful consideration, a researcher may forgo the informed consent process. This is commonly done after weighting the risk to study participants versus the benefit to society and whether participants are present in the study out of their own wish and treated fairly.[38] Researchers often consult with an ethics committee or institutional review board to render a decision.\\r\\nThe birth of new online media, such as social media, has complicated the idea of informed consent. In an online environment people pay little attention to Terms of Use agreements and can subject themselves to research without thorough knowledge. This issue came to the public light following a study conducted by Facebook Inc. in 2014, and published by that company and Cornell University.[39] Facebook conducted a study where they altered the Facebook News Feeds of roughly 700,000 users to reduce either the amount of positive or negative posts they saw for a week. The study then analyzed if the users status updates changed during the different conditions. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\\r\\nThe lack of informed consent led to outrage among many researchers and users.[40] Many believed that by potentially altering the mood of users by altering what posts they see, Facebook put at-risk individuals at higher dangers for depression and suicide. However, supports of Facebook claim that Facebook details that they have the right to use information for research in their terms of use.[41] Others say the experiment is just a part of Facebooks current work, which alters News Feeds algorithms continually to keep people interested and coming back to the site. Others pointed out that this specific study is not along but that news organizations constantly try out different headlines using algorithms to elicit emotions and garner clicks or Facebook shares.[42] They say this Facebook study is no different than things people already accept. Still, others say that Facebook broke the law when conducting the experiment on user that didnt give informed consent.[43]\\r\\nThe Facebook study controversy raises numerous questions about informed consent and the differences in the ethical review process between publicly and privately funded research. Some say Facebook was within its limits and others see the need for more informed consent and/or the establishment of in-house private review boards.[44]\\r\\nOther, long-standing controversies underscore the role for conflicts of interest among medical school faculty and researchers. For example, coverage of University of California (UC) medical school faculty members has included news of ongoing corporate payments to researchers and practitioners from companies that market and produce the very devices and treatments they recommend to patients.[45] Robert Pedowitz, the former chairman of UCLAs orthopedic surgery department, reported concern that his colleagues financial conflicts of interest could negatively affect patient care or research into new treatments.[46] In a subsequent lawsuit about whistleblower retaliation, the University provided a $10 million settlement to Pedowitz while acknowledging no wrongdoing.[46] Consumer Watchdog, an oversight group, observed that University of CA policies were either inadequate or unenforcedPatients in UC hospitals deserve the most reliable surgical devices and medicationand they shouldnt be treated as subjects in expensive experiments.[45] Other UC incidents include taking the eggs of women for implantation into other women without consent[47] and injecting live bacteria into human brains, resulting in potentially premature deaths.[48]","input":"Where did the concept of informed consent originate?"},{"output":"five times","context":"","input":"How many times have penguins won stanley cup?"},{"output":"approximately 7.68 million people","context":"","input":"What is the population of the bay area in california?"},{"output":"between 15:1 and 23:1","context":"","input":"How much compression does a diesel engine have?"},{"output":"approximately 2.79 million","context":"The United States federal civil service is the civilian workforce (i.e., non-elected and non-military, public sector employees) of the United States federal government's departments and agencies. The federal civil service was established in 1871 (5 U.S.C.??2101).[1] U.S. state and local government entities often have competitive civil service systems that are modeled on the national system, in varying degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Office of Personnel Management, as of  December 2011[update], there were approximately 2.79 million civil servants employed by the U.S. government.[2][3][4] This includes employees in the departments and agencies run by any of the three branches government (the executive branch, legislative branch, and judicial branch), such as over 600,000 employees in the U.S. Postal Service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of civil service positions are classified as competitive service, meaning employees are selected based on merit after a competitive hiring process for positions that are open to all applicants. The Senior Executive Service (SES) is the classification for non-competitive, senior leadership positions filled by career employees or political appointments (e.g., Cabinet members, ambassadors, etc.). Excepted service positions (also known as unclassified service) are non-competitive jobs in certain federal agencies with security and intelligence functions (e.g., the CIA, FBI, State Department, etc.) that are authorized to create their own hiring policies and are not subject to most appointment, pay, and classification laws.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 19th century, positions in the federal government were held at the pleasure of the presidenta person could be fired at any time. The spoils system meant that jobs were used to support the American political parties, though this was gradually changed by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 and subsequent laws. By 1909, almost two-thirds of the U.S. federal workforce was appointed based on merit, that is, qualifications measured by tests. Certain senior civil service positions, including some heads of diplomatic missions and executive agencies, are filled by political appointees. Under the Hatch Act of 1939, civil servants are not allowed to engage in political activities while performing their duties.[6] In some cases, an outgoing administration will give its political appointees positions with civil service protection in order to prevent them from being fired by the new administration; this is called \\"burrowing\\" in civil service jargon.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nEmployees in the civil services work under one of the independent agencies or one of the 15 executive departments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to departments, there are a number of staff organizations grouped into the Executive Office of the President. These include the White House staff, the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also independent agencies such as the United States Postal Service, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In addition, there are government-owned corporations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were 456 federal agencies in 2009.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pay system of the United States government civil service has evolved into a complex set of pay systems that include principally the General Schedule (GS) for white-collar employees, Federal Wage System (FWS) for blue-collar employees, Senior Executive System (SES) for Executive-level employees, Foreign Service Schedule (FS) for members of the Foreign Service and more than twelve alternate pay systems that are referred to as alternate or experimental pay systems such as the first experimental system China Lake Demonstration Project. The current system began as the Classification Act of 1923[10] and was refined into law with the Classification Act of 1949. These acts that provide the foundation of the current system have been amended through executive orders and through published amendments in the Federal Register that sets for approved changes in the regulatory structure of the federal pay system. The common goal among all pay systems is to achieve the goal of paying equitable salaries to all involved workers regardless of system, group or classification. This is referred to as pay equity or (\\"equal pay for equal work\\"). Select careers in high demand may be subject to a special rate table,[11] which can pay above the standard GS tables. These careers include certain engineering disciplines and patent examiners.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe General Schedule (GS) includes white collar workers at levels 1 through 15, most professional, technical, administrative, and clerical positions in the federal civil service. The Federal Wage System or Wage Grade (WG) schedule includes most federal blue-collar workers. As of  September?2004[update], 71% of federal civilian employees were paid under the GS; the remaining 29% were paid under other systems such as the Federal Wage System for federal blue-collar civilian employees, the Senior Executive Service/Senior Level and the Executive Schedule for high-ranking federal employees, and the pay schedules for the United States Postal Service and the Foreign Service. In addition, some federal agenciessuch as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporationhave their own unique pay schedules.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll federal employees in the GS system receive a base pay that is adjusted for locality. Locality pay varies, but is at least 10% of base salary in all parts of the United States. The following salary ranges represent the lowest and highest possible amounts a person can earn in base salary, without earning over-time pay or receiving a merit-based bonus. Actual salary ranges differ adjusted for increased locality pay (for instance a GS-9, step 1 in rural Arkansas may start at $50,598[14] versus $61,084[15] in San Jose, California), but all base salaries lie within the parameters of the following ranges (effective January, 2018):[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nNineteen percent of federal employees earned salaries of $100,000 or more in 2009. The average federal worker's pay was $71,208 compared with $40,331 in the private sector, although under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, most menial or lower paying jobs have been outsourced to private contractors.[18] In 2010, there were 82,034 workers, 3.9% of the federal workforce, making more than $150,000 annually, compared to 7,240 in 2005.[19] GS salaries are capped by law so that they do not exceed the salary for Executive Schedule IV positions.[20] The increase in civil servants making more than $150,000 resulted mainly from an increase in Executive Schedule salary approved during the Administration of George W. Bush, which raised the salary cap for senior GS employees slightly above the $150,000 threshold.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nBasic pay rates for Senior Executive Service (i.e. non-Presidentially appointed civil servants above GS-15) will range from $119,554 to $179,700 in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  January?2009[update], the Federal Government, excluding the Postal Service and soldiers, employed about 2 million civilian workers.\\r\\n The Federal Government is the nation's single largest employer.  Although most federal agencies are based in the Washington, D.C. region, only about 16% (or about 288,000) of the federal government workforce is employed in this region.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic support in the United States for civil service reform strengthened following the assassination of President James Garfield.[24] The United States Civil Service Commission was created by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, which was passed into law on January 16, 1883. The commission was created to administer the civil service of the United States federal government. The law required federal government employees to be selected through competitive exams and basis of merit;[24] it also prevented elected officials and political appointees from firing civil servants, removing civil servants from the influences of political patronage and partisan behavior.[24][25]  However, the law did not apply to state and municipal governments.\\r\\n\\r\\nEffective January 1, 1978, the commission was renamed the Office of Personnel Management under the provisions of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978 (43 F.R. 36037, 92 Stat. 3783) and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Civil service exams have since been abolished for many positions, since statistics show that they do not accurately allow hiring of minorities according to the affirmative action guidelines.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis act abolished the United States Civil Service Commission and created the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) and the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). OPM primarily provides management guidance to the various agencies of the executive branch and issues regulations that control federal human resources. FLRA oversees the rights of federal employees to form collective bargaining units (unions) and to engage in collective bargaining with agencies. MSPB conducts studies of the federal civil service and mainly hears the appeals of federal employees who are disciplined or otherwise separated from their positions. This act was an effort to replace incompetent officials.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Donald Trump signed three executive orders designed to enforce merit-system principles in the civil service and to improve efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the federal government. According to reports, the executive orders are expected to make civil service more accountable and are supposed to benefit taxpayers and federal workers alike.[29]","input":"How many bureaucrats work for the us government?"},{"output":"the 19th century","context":"","input":"During what time in history were gothic stories popular?"},{"output":"Passport Program of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian passport (French: Passeport canadien) is the passport issued to citizens of Canada. It enables the bearer to exit and re-enter Canada freely; travel to and from other countries in accordance with visa requirements; facilitates the process of securing assistance from Canadian consular officials abroad, if necessary; and requests protection for the bearer while abroad.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Canadian passports are issued by the Passport Program of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).[5] Prior to 1 July 2013, Canadian passports were issued by Passport Canada, an independent operating agency of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada.[6] They are normally valid for five or ten years for persons 16 years of age and older, and five years for children under 16.[1] In 2017, 60 per cent of Canadians had passports, with there being about 22 million passports in circulation.[5] Although held by individuals, all Canadian passports remain property of the Government of Canada and must be returned to the Passport Program upon request.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada is a member of the Five Nations Passport Group, an international forum for cooperation between the passport issuing authorities in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States to \\"share best practices and discuss innovations related to the development of passport policies, products and practices\\".[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada began issuing biometric passports, also known as electronic passports or e-passports, to Canadian citizens on 1 July 2013.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Canadian passports were issued in 1862, following the outbreak of the American Civil War, when the United States demanded more secure identification from Canadians wishing to cross the border. They took the form of a \\"Letter of Request\\" from the Governor General of Canada. These documents remained in use until, in 1915, Canadian passports were first issued in the British format, a ten section single sheet folder.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern form of the Canadian passport came about in 1921. At that time, Canadians were British subjects, and Canada shared a common nationality with the United Kingdom; thus, Canadian passports were issued to those British subjects resident in or connected to Canada. This arrangement ended in 1947, when the Canadian Citizenship Act was granted Royal Assent and the designation of Canadian citizenship was created. Beginning in July the following year, Canadian passports were issued to Canadian citizens only.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1947 and 1970, Canadian citizens could only apply for passports by mail to Ottawa. Requirements were simple, and applicants claiming birth in Canada did not have to provide proof of birth. The lax security has led to numerous cases of misuse of the passport, so the Canadian Government tightened the application requirements from 1970. That year, the first three Passport Canada offices were opened in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1985, the first version of machine-readable passports (MRP) was issued, in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization standards. An amended version came into circulation in 1991, with additional security features and more stringent processing requirements. By 1993, a newer version of MRP was introduced, which contained unique features to prevent replication or alteration.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 11 December 2001, children have not been included in parents' passports, and passports have been issued for one person only.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, Passport Canada began to issue an updated version within Canada, which includes the digitally printed photo of the bearer embedded into the identification page of the booklet, holographic images, bar-coded serial number, and a second hidden photo of the bearer that could only be viewed under ultraviolet light. Canadian diplomatic missions abroad adopted this version in 2006.[3] In March 2010, the passport was upgraded to include a new design of the identification page and more anti-counterfeit elements, such as the new colours of Optically Variable Ink and addition of laser perforated number. The cover, watermark, personalization technique and holographic laminate are same with the 2002 version. The 2010 version was also the last revision of MRP prior to the release of e-passports.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2008 federal budget, Jim Flaherty, Minister of Finance, announced that biometric passports (\\"e-passports\\") would be introduced by 2011.[12] A pilot project began in 2009, with e-passports being issued to special and diplomatic passport applicants.[13] The e-passport roll-out was pushed back to 1 July 2013. On the same day, the issuing authority of Canadian passports was shifted from Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), now known as IRCC.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issuance of passports falls under the Royal Prerogative. They are issued, in the name of the reigning Canadian monarch (as expressed in the passport note), according to the Canadian Passport Order.[6] This Order in Council specifies grounds for which Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) can issue or renew a passport.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, all Canadian citizens have the right to enter Canada. There is a requirement for a Canadian citizen to use a Canadian passport when entering  Canada by air. Since 10 November 2016, under the new visa regulations all visa-free passport holders (except for U.S. citizens and nationals) are required to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) before boarding a flight to Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the eTA is used for the sole purpose of immigration screening for non-Canadian visitors entering Canada on a temporary basis, all Canadian citizens are automatically barred from applying the eTA. Hence the passport requirement is in place, because a Canadian citizen who travels on a visa-free, non-Canadian passport will be prevented from boarding the commercial flight to Canada unless he or she can present a valid Canadian passport during check-in.[14] The only exceptions to this rule are for a Canadian citizen travelling on a U.S. passport, as Americans do not need an eTA to enter Canada, or when a Canadian citizen travelling on an eTA-required passport enters Canada by sea or through one of the land ports of entry from the U.S.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadians in Canada can submit their applications in person through a passport office, a Service Canada location, a Canada Post receiving agent, or can submit their applications by mail. Canadians in the U.S. or Bermuda can apply only by mail. Canadians living in other countries or territories are required to apply through the nearest Canadian diplomatic posts abroad. Expedited services (urgent, express and standard pick-ups) are only available through a passport office in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian passport issuing system is modelled after the United Kingdom, where all first-time passport applications are required to be \\"countersigned\\" by a person who works in a recognized profession.[15] Australia and New Zealand have similar policies. The use of a guarantor is to serve \\"as a security measure in the entitlement process and as a point of departure for the future investigation of statements made on the application form\\".[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nRules regarding the eligibility of guarantors were last updated on 12 August 2013. For passport applicants in Canada, only a Canadian passport holder can be a guarantor. For Canadian citizens living abroad who do not have a Canadian guarantor, a non-Canadian guarantor who works in a licensed profession may be used for application, such as a dentist, medical doctor, judge, lawyer, notary public, pharmacist, police officer, veterinarian, or sitting officer for a financial institution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fee (since 1 July 2013) for a standard adult passport issued in Canada is $120 for a five-year passport or $160 for a ten-year passport, and outside of Canada is $190 and $260 respectively. The fee for a five-year passport for a child under 16 is $57 if issued in Canada, and $100 outside of Canada.   Additional fees are levied for urgent service or replacement of a lost or stolen passport. All fees are payable in Canadian dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nIRCC may revoke a passport or refuse to issue or renew a passport on grounds set out in the Canadian Passport Order, including such grounds as failure to submit a complete application, misrepresentation in obtaining a passport, and criminality. However, whether a Canadian passport may be revoked or refused on the basis of national security concerns has been questioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore 1947, there were two types of passports: those issued to people who were born British subjects (navy blue cover) and those issued to people naturalized as British subjects (red cover).\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, there are five types of Canadian passports:[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nCover of a Canadian Temporary Passport\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian Emergency Travel Document\\r\\n\\r\\nCover of a Canadian Special e-Passport\\r\\n\\r\\nCover of a Canadian Diplomatic e-Passport\\r\\n\\r\\nRegular passports are deep navy blue, with the Royal Arms of Canada emblazoned in the centre of the front cover. The words \\"PASSPORT?PASSEPORT\\" and the international e-passport symbol ()[22] are inscribed below the coat of arms, and \\"CANADA\\" above. The bilingual cover is indicative of the textual portions of Canadian passports being printed in both English and French, Canada's two official languages. The standard passport contains 36 pages, with 29 available for entry/exit stamps and visas. The size dimensions of a closed Canadian passport are 8.89 cm (3.5\\") (width) and 12.7 cm (5\\") (height).\\r\\n\\r\\nNew security features, similar to those on banknotes, have been added with increasing frequency since 2001. Microprinting, holographic images, UV-visible imaging, watermarks and other details have been implemented, particularly on the photo page. As well, the photo is now digitally printed directly on the paper (in both standard and UV-reactive ink); previously, the actual photo had been laminated inside the document.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe information page ends with the Machine Readable Zone.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2002 until May 2015, all Canadian passports contained two signature spaces: one is on the data page where a scanned signature is printed along with other personal details, the other is a blank signature block on page 3. After the applicants have received the passport, those over 16 must also sign in the signature block in ink.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince May 2015, the passport bearer's scanned signature has not been printed on the data page. Adult applicants, however, must still sign page 3 in the passport book when they receive it.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 24 August 2017 the Canadian government announced that it would implement procedures for Canadians who wish to have their sex given as X (unspecified) on Canadian passports, which is one of the three permitted sex designations for machine-readable passports along with M (male) and F (female) specified by the International Civil Aviation Organization.[25][26] As an interim measure until IRCC are able to print passports with X sex designations, effective 31 August 2017 IRCC offers passports with a note on the Observations page indicating that the passport holder should be identified as X rather than the printed sex designation on the data page.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe passports contain a note from the issuing authority addressed to the authorities of all other states, identifying the bearer as a citizen of that state and requesting that they be allowed to pass and be treated according to international norms. The textual portions of Canadian passports are printed in English and French, the official languages of Canada. The note inside of Canadian passports states:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place of birth is inscribed under the following format: CITYNAME UTO, whereas \\"UTO\\" is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code of the country of birth. The first-level administrative country subdivisions of birth, such as the Canadian province or the U.S. state, is not mentioned as a part of place of birth, so Canadian citizens born in Portland, Maine or Portland, Oregon can have the same inscription as place of birth: PORTLAND USA. Exceptions to this format are listed below.\\r\\n\\r\\nA passport applicant may request, in writing, that IRCC to not list the place of birth (city and country) - or country of birth - on their data page, by filling out PPTC 077. The applicant must indicate his or her awareness that omitting this information could cause difficulties at international entry points or when applying for visas.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the Chinese government's modification of requirements for the issuance of visas to Canadian citizens born in Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan, Canadian passports issued to Canadians born in Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan are now issued only with the place of birth and not the three-letter country code. Chinese visas will no longer be issued to Canadian passport holders whose place of birth is inscribed as Hong Kong HKG, Macau MAC, or  TWN.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince April 1976, the policy has been that Canadian citizens born in Jerusalem have their birthplace identified only by the city's name, with no national designation, due to the unresolved legal status of Jerusalem.[30] However, Canadian citizens born prior to 14 May 1948 may have their birthplace identified as Palestine if they were born in what was the British Mandate of Palestine (including Jerusalem).[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2003, Le Devoir printed a piece calling on Passport Canada to give individual Canadians the choice of which official language appeared first in their passports, English or French.  The Passport Office claimed that this was not allowed under international norms, but it was shown that Belgian passport applications asked Belgian citizens which of their country's three official languages (Dutch, French or German) should appear first in their passports.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, Passport Canada announced that it would be issuing electronic passports to Canadian travellers starting in 2012. The e-passport will have an electronic chip encoded with the bearer's name, gender, and date and place of birth and a digital portrait of their face.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 April 2010, Passport Canada announced that in 2012, Canada will begin issuing electronic passports, or ePassports, to all its citizens. Passport Canada states that \\"the use of ePassports will allow Canada to follow international standards in the field of passport security to protect the nation's borders and maintain the ease of international travel that Canadians currently enjoy. At the same time, Passport Canada will start offering the option of a 10-year validity period as well as the current 5-year validity period.\\"[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2011, Passport Canada announced that the electronic passport would be ready by the end of 2012, however this was pushed back to 2013 when the organization found significant delay because of an increase in passport applications for revised entry policies to the United States in late 2000s and a lengthy consultation process was needed to survey public reactions to the new passport changes.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Canadian passports issued on or after 1 July 2013 have been ePassports.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll ePassports are issued with 36 pages as opposed to the previous choice of 24 or 48 pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, IRCC (then known as CIC) planned to make moderation to the passport renewal system by integrating the passport issuance platform with its Global Case Management System (GCMS), a consolidated IT system for citizenship and immigration applications.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the proposed system modeled after New Zealand, passport holders would no longer need to return their old passports to CIC for cancellation, but can instead apply for a new passport online while keeping the old documents before they receive the new ones. Instead of returning the old passports, applicants would be asked to cut the corners of these documents \\"through an honour system\\".[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new process was expected to be available in November 2015, however the plan was cancelled in October when the use of GCMS for passport applications was temporarily suspended due to numerous security glitches in the system.[37] IRCC permanently suspended the use of GCMS for passport applications in February 2016 following an internal audit. GCMS will not be used for passport applications until all risks, which include \\"Passport Program business requirements\\", are identified and secured.[38][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its introduction, the Canadian passport has been a favorable target of counterfeiters, criminals and agents of foreign governments. The reasons for such high number of misuses include the relative lax issuance process before 1970,[3] the lack of anti-counterfeit features in early non-MRP versions, and Canadian passport's high number of visa-free countries. In 2015, a fake or altered Canadian passport can cost as much as US$3,000 on the black market, almost three times higher than fake or altered EU passports.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile not a case of misuse, as it was conducted with secret approval of the Canadian government, six American diplomats were smuggled out of Iran using authentic Canadian passports containing forged Iranian visas in 1980.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2004, Abdurahman Khadr was denied a Canadian passport by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson on the explicit advice of her Foreign Affairs Minister, Bill Graham, who stated the decision was \\"in the interest of the national security of Canada and the protection of Canadian troops in Afghanistan.\\" The government invoked Royal Prerogative in order to deny Khadr's passport, as national security was not at that time listed in the Canadian Passport Order as a ground for refusal. Shortly thereafter, on 22 September 2004, section 10.1 was added to the order, which allowed the minister to revoke or refuse a passport due to national security concerns.[47] Khadr sought judicial review of the minister's decision to refuse his passport and,[48] on 8 June of the following year, the Federal Court ruled that the government did not have the power to refuse to issue Khadr's passport in the absence of specific authority set out in the Canadian Passport Order, but stated in obiter dicta that if the order were to be amended, Khadr would likely not be able to challenge the revocation.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, then Peter MacKay, again denied Khadr's application, this time invoking section 10.1 of the amended Canadian Passport Order.[50] Section 10.1 was later challenged in Federal Court by Fateh Kamel, whose passport had also been refused for national security reasons. On 13 March 2008, the Federal Court declared section 10.1 of the Canadian Passport Order to be unconstitutional and therefore invalid,[51][52] though the court suspended its declaration of invalidity for six months in order to allow the government time to amend the order. The federal government launched an appeal at the Federal Court of Appeal and a ruling handed down on 29 January 2009 overturned the lower court decision. The court unanimously agreed the denial of passport service on national grounds is in compliance with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, citing the limitation clause (Section 1) as its main decision point.[53][54] Kamel launched an appeal in 2009 to the Supreme Court of Canada but the court declined to hear his case and thus ended the legality challenge to the Canadian Passport Order.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, Kamel attempted to re-apply for a Canadian passport but was once again refused by the minister on grounds of national security. He sought judicial review but was dismissed by the Federal Court and subsequently by the Federal Court of Appeal in 2013.[56] Kamel did not appeal the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Canadian passport serves as the proof of holder's identity and nationality status outside Canada. Contrary to popular belief, however, a Canadian passport itself, be it valid or invalid, is only a prima facie proof of Canadian citizenship. Conclusive proof of Canadian citizenship, as dictated by the IRCC, only includes the following documents:[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the provincial or territorial birth certificate is accepted by IRCC as valid proof of citizenship, Section 3(2) of the Citizenship Act declared that a child born in Canada to either parent who was a diplomatic or consular officer or other representative of a foreign country, or an employee in the service of such person, is not a Canadian citizen if neither parent was a Canadian citizen or Canadian permanent resident at time of the child's birth. Such persons may be issued Canadian passports, as their provincial or territorial issued birth certificate are considered as proof of citizenship. Under the Act, however, they are legally not Canadian citizens even if they hold a valid Canadian passport.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ambiguity on the enforcement of the Act can create hardship for Canadian passport holders who assumed they were Canadian citizens. Deepan Budlakoti, a stateless man born in Ottawa to Indian parents who were employed by the Indian High Commission at the time of his birth, was twice issued a Canadian passport under the assumption that he was a Canadian citizen by virtue of being born in Canada.[58] His Canadian passport, however, was cancelled after his criminal convictions in 2010 brought the investigation by Citizenship and Immigration Canada, which concluded in 2011 that he was not a Canadian citizen, but a permanent resident. His appeals to the Federal Courts, and subsequently to the Supreme Court of Canada to recognize him as a Canadian citizen, were denied.[59] The Indian government claims that he had lost his Indian citizenship by obtaining a Canadian passport, as Rule 3 of Schedule III of the Citizenship Rules, 1956 of India states that \\"the fact that a citizen of India has obtained on any date a passport from the Government of any other country shall be conclusive proof of his/her having voluntarily acquired the citizenship of that country before that date\\".[59] Budlakoti, therefore, is stateless, regardless of the fact that he had held a Canadian passport.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisa requirements for Canadian citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Canada. According to the 2018 Henley visa restrictions index, holders of a Canadian passport can visit 185 countries and territories visa-free or with visa on arrival, ranking the Canadian passport 5th in the world (tied with Belgian, Irish and Swiss passports) according to the Visa Restrictions Index.[60][61] Additionally, Arton Capital's Passport Index ranked the Canadian passport 4th in the world in terms of travel freedom, with a visa-free score of 162 (tied with Austrian, Belgian, Irish, Greek, Malaysian and Portuguese passports), as of 2 July 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 2007, Canadians could enter the United States by presenting a birth certificate (or other proof of Canadian citizenship) along with a form of photo identification (such as a driver's licence). In many cases United States border agents would accept a verbal declaration of citizenship.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the United States Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, since 23 January 2007, all Canadians entering the United States via air have been required to present a valid passport or NEXUS card.[62] Since 1 June 2009, the United States has required all Canadian citizens (16 years or older) to present a passport, NEXUS card, enhanced driver's licence, or Free and Secure Trade (FAST) card to enter the U.S. via land or water.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most circumstances, Canadian citizens do not require visitor, business, transit or other visas to enter the United States, either from Canada or from other countries. Moreover, Canadian citizens are generally granted a stay in the U.S. for up to six months at the time of entry. Visa requirements only apply to Canadians who fall under visa categories E (investors), K (fianc(e)s or spouses and their children of U.S. citizens), V (spouses and children of Lawful Permanent Residents), S (informants), A (Canadian government officials travelling on official business), G (Canadian diplomats working for international organizations in the U.S.) and NATO (Canadians working specifically for the NATO), and they must apply for a visa before entry in the same manner as other nationalities.[63][64]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian students are exempted from the visa requirements if they hold a valid form I-20 or DS-2019 and have paid their SEVIS registration fees, which enables them to travel to the U.S. under F-1 or J-1 statuses.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Canadian citizens can legally work in the U.S. under simplified procedure, known as TN status, if their professions are under NAFTA regulations and they have a prearranged full-time or part-time job with a U.S. employer. Obtaining TN status does not involve getting a physical visa, instead the applicant is required to apply and receive TN status with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at a U.S. port of entry. The TN status is good for three years once approved and can be renewed indefinitely if working for the same employer, however it may be reviewed and possibly revoked each time the applicant enters the U.S. TN status also does not facilitate the process of obtaining lawful U.S. permanent residency and cannot be used to live in the U.S. permanently.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadians who want to work in the U.S. with intention to immigrate to the U.S., or who are ineligible for TN status, can also work under the H-1B status. Unlike other nationalities, they are exempted from obtaining the physical visa from a U.S. embassy or consulate. Apart from the visa exemption, other procedures are the same with all foreign nationals.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Jay Treaty signed by the U.S. and Great Britain in 1794, all First Nations born in Canada are entitled to freely enter the U.S. for employment, education, retirement, investing, or immigration. In order to qualify, all eligible persons must provide documentation of their First Nations background at the port of entry. The documentation must be sufficient to show the bearer is \\"at least 50% of the American Indian race\\".[68][69]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the statistics these are the numbers of Canadian visitors to various countries per annum in 2015 (unless otherwise noted):\\r\\n\\r\\n1400\\r\\n300\\r\\n1000\\r\\n100\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial passport issued for the purpose of attending the 1936 Vimy pilgrimage.

Originally established in 1890 as General Grant National Park, the park was greatly expanded and renamed to Kings Canyon National Park on March 4, 1940. The park's namesake, Kings Canyon, is a rugged glacier-carved valley more than a mile (1,600?m) deep. Other natural features include multiple 14,000-foot (4,300?m) peaks, high mountain meadows, swift-flowing rivers, and some of the world's largest stands of giant sequoia trees. Kings Canyon is north of and contiguous with Sequoia National Park, and the two are jointly administered by the National Park Service as the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of the 461,901-acre (186,925?ha) park, drained by the Middle and South Forks of the Kings River and many smaller streams, is designated wilderness. Tourist facilities are concentrated in two areas: Grant Grove, home to General Grant (the second largest tree in the world, measured by trunk volume) and Cedar Grove/Kanawyers, located in the heart of Kings Canyon. Overnight hiking is required to access most of the park's backcountry, or high country, which for much of the year is covered in deep snow. The combined Pacific Crest Trail/John Muir Trail, a popular backpacking route, traverses the entire length of the park from north to south.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Grant National Park was initially created to protect a small area of giant sequoias from logging. Although John Muir's visits brought public attention to the huge wilderness area to the east, it took more than fifty years for the rest of Kings Canyon to be designated a national park. Environmental groups, park visitors and many local politicians wanted to see the area preserved; however, development interests wanted to build hydroelectric dams in the canyon. Even after President Franklin D. Roosevelt expanded the park in 1940, the fight continued until 1965, when the Cedar Grove and Tehipite Valley dam sites were finally annexed into the park.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs visitation rose post-World War II, further debate took place over whether the park should be developed as a tourist resort, or retained as a more natural environment restricted to simpler recreation such as hiking and camping. Ultimately, the preservation lobby prevailed and today, the park has only limited services and lodgings despite its size. Due to this and the lack of road access to most of the park, Kings Canyon remains the least visited of the major Sierra parks, with just over 600,000 visitors in 2016[3] compared to 1.2 million visitors at Sequoia[4] and over 5 million at Yosemite.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nKings Canyon National Park, located on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada to the east of the San Joaquin Valley, is divided into two distinct sections. The smaller and older western section centers around Grant Grove ÿ home of many of the park's sequoias ÿ and has most of the visitor facilities. The larger eastern section, which accounts for the majority of the park's area, is almost entirely wilderness, and contains the deep canyons of the Middle and South Forks of the Kings River. Cedar Grove, located at the bottom of the Kings Canyon, is the only part of the park's vast eastern portion accessible by road (via Highway 180). Although most of the park is forested, much of the eastern section consists of alpine regions above the tree line. Usually snow free only from late June until late October, the high country is accessible solely via foot and horse trails.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sequoia-Kings Canyon Wilderness encompasses over 768,000 acres (311,000?ha) in Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks, or nearly 90?percent of their combined area.[7] In addition to Sequoia National Park on the south, Kings Canyon is surrounded by multiple national forests and wilderness areas. The Sierra National Forest, Sequoia National Forest and Inyo National Forest border it on the northwest, west and east, respectively. The John Muir Wilderness wraps around much of the northern half of the park, and the Monarch Wilderness preserves much of the area between the park's two sections.\\r\\n\\r\\nKings Canyon is characterized by some of the steepest vertical relief in North America, with numerous peaks over 14,000 feet (4,300?m) on the Sierra Crest along the park's eastern border, falling to 4,500 feet (1,400?m) in the valley floor of Cedar Grove just ten miles (16?km) to the west.  The Sierran crest forms the eastern boundary of the park, from Mount Goethe in the north, down to Junction Peak, at the boundary with Sequoia National Park. Several passes cross the crest into the park, including Bishop Pass, Taboose Pass, Sawmill Pass, and Kearsarge Pass. All of these passes are above 11,000 feet (3,400?m) in elevation.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several prominent subranges of the Sierra within and around the park. The Palisades, along the park's eastern boundary, have four peaks over 14,000 feet (4,300?m) including the highest point in the park,  14,248 feet (4,343?m)?NAVD?88 at the summit of North Palisade.[9] The Great Western Divide extends through the south-central part of the park and also has many peaks over 13,000 feet (4,000?m), including Mount Brewer.[10] The Monarch Divide, stretching between the lower Middle and South Forks of the Kings, has some of the most inaccessible terrain in the entire park. In the northwest section of the park are other very steep and rugged ranges such as the Goddard Divide, LeConte Divide and Black Divide, all of which are dotted with high mountain lakes and separated by deep chasms.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the mountains and canyons, as in other parts of the Sierra Nevada, are formed in igneous intrusive rocks such as granite, diorite and monzonite, formed at least 100 million years ago due to subduction along the North AmericanÿPacific Plate boundary. However, the Sierra itself is a young mountain range, no more than 10 million years old.[11] Huge tectonic forces along the western edge of the Great Basin forced the local crustal block to tilt and uplift, creating the mountains' gradual slope to the west and the nearly vertical escarpment to the east bordering the Owens Valley. Many cave systems are also formed in the rock layers, including Boyden Cave along the South Fork of the Kings River.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present shape of the high country was largely sculpted by glaciations during successive Ice Ages over the last 2.5 million years. Large valley glaciers moved as far as 44 miles (71?km)[12]:234ÿ35 down the South and Middle Forks of the Kings River, carving out the distinctive deep U-shaped valleys at Cedar Grove and Paradise Valley on the South Fork, and Tehipite Valley on the Middle Fork. Ice Age glaciations did not extend all the way to the confluence of the Middle and South Forks; consequently, the canyons downstream of Cedar Grove and Tehipite are typical V-shaped river gorges, in contrast to the U-shaped valleys upstream.[13][14]:17\\r\\n\\r\\nThe glacial valleys are characterized by flat floors and exposed granite cliffs and domes many thousands of feet high, similar in form to the more famous Yosemite Valley to the north, and in fact the term \\"yosemite\\" was used in the 19th century by John Muir to describe these valleys before they were widely known by their own names.[11] In A Rival of the Yosemite, published in 1891 in The Century Illustrated Magazine,[15]:170 John Muir wrote of Kings Canyon:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the vast Sierra wilderness far to the southward of the famous Yosemite Valley, there is a yet grander valley of the same kind. It is situated on the south fork of the Kings River, above the most extensive groves and forests of the giant sequoia, and beneath the shadows of the highest mountains in the range, where the ca?ons are deepest and the snow-laden peaks are crowded most closely together. It is called the Big King's River Ca?on, or King's River Yosemite...The stupendous rocks of purplish gray granite that form the walls are from 2500 to 5000 feet in height, while the depth of the valley is considerably more than a mile.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bottom of the valley... is diversified with flowery meadows and groves and open sunny flats, through the midst of which the crystal river, ever changing, ever beautiful, makes its way; now gliding softly with scarce a ripple over beds of brown pebbles, now rustling and leaping in wild exultation across avalanche rock-dams or terminal moraines... From this long, flowery, forested, well-watered park the walls rise abruptly in plain precipices or richly sculptured masses partly separated by side ca?ons baring wonderful wealth and variety of architectural forms.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the brink of the walls on either side the ground still rises in a series of ice-carved ridges and basins, superbly forested and adorned with many small lakes and meadows where deer and bear find grateful homes; while from the head of the valley other mountains rise beyond in glorious array, every one of them shining with rock crystals and snow, and with a network of streams that sing their way down from lake to lake through a labyrinth of ice-burnished ca?ons.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther significant glacial features include Tehipite Dome, the largest granite dome in the Sierra, rising 3,500 feet (1,100?m) above the floor of Tehipite Valley.[17] In Kings Canyon and across the high country, such sheer granite cliffs are subject to exfoliation, frost weathering and earthquakes which cause sudden and dramatic rockfalls. Over thousands of years, cliff collapses have built up large talus piles or scree slopes at their bases along almost every glacial valley in the park.\\r\\n\\r\\nZumwalt Meadow, one of the few large areas of flat land in the park, was formed by the accumulation of sediment behind the terminal moraine of a retreating glacier. In Kings Canyon there are in fact four such moraines, which the Kings River cascades over, forming whitewater rapids, in an area where it otherwise winds calmly across meadows. The series of moraines one behind the other are termed \\"nested moraines\\", each created during a different glacial period by glaciers of varying length.[18]:147\\r\\n\\r\\nElsewhere in the high country, the landscape of bare rock and talus left by former glaciers is replete with hanging valleys, waterfalls, serrated ridges (artes), cirques, and hundreds of alpine tarns.[11] Some of the highest peaks retain permanent snowfields and even glaciers. Palisade Glacier, the largest in the Sierra, is located near the park's edge in the John Muir Wilderness.[12]:235 These glaciers are not holdovers from the Ice Ages; rather, they were most likely formed during cold periods in the last 1,000 years. The park's glaciers are now melting rapidly due to increased temperatures, and may disappear completely within a few decades.[19]:443\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of major Sierra rivers have their origins in the park. The South Fork Kings River flows from near Taboose Pass, on the park's eastern boundary, and drains much of the southern half of the park, carving the canyon from which the park takes its name. The Middle Fork Kings River originates near Mount Powell and drains most of the park's northern half.[8] A smaller section in the northern tip of the park is drained by the South Fork of the San Joaquin River.[8] The Kings River falls more than 13,000 feet (4,000?m) from the Sierra crest to Pine Flat Reservoir in the San Joaquin Valley ÿ the longest undammed drop of any North American river.[20]:44\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the park's borders are formed by watershed divides between river basins. The eastern boundary follows the Sierra Crest, which to the east is drained by the Owens River, part of the Great Basin watershed. The southern boundary with Sequoia National Park is the divide between the Kings, Kaweah and Kern Rivers. Part of the western boundary follows the divide between the Middle and North Forks of the Kings River.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe forks of the Kings River converge in the Sequoia National Forest, a few miles outside the western boundary of the park, to form the main stem of the river. Here, the river forms one of the deepest canyons in North America, its walls rising as much as 8,200 feet (2,500?m) from river to rim ÿ about half a mile (0.8?km) deeper than the Grand Canyon.[6] The canyons upstream at Cedar Grove are also more than 5,000 feet (1,500?m) deep.[21] Although the geology and topography of Cedar Grove and Tehipite Valley are similar to that of Yosemite Valley, the park does not have waterfalls as high and spectacular as those in Yosemite.[22] There are several powerful, but short waterfalls including Mist Falls, Roaring River Falls and Grizzly Falls in the Cedar Grove area.[23] The backcountry is home to some much higher falls. Silver Spray Falls in Tehipite Valley drops about 700 feet (210?m)[24] in several tiers. In a 1910 article in Out West, Ernestine Winchell describes the falls and Tehipite Valley:\\r\\n\\r\\n...We paused a moment at the colossal doorway where Tehipite, shimmering through spaces of summer sunshine, in peaceful grandeur compelled our reverential gaze... Across the river and below the dome Crown Creek races in sparkling cascades to grind a score of horrible pot-holes big enough to swallow a horse and rider; leaves that ferocious task to foam lightly down a cliff as Silver Spray Fall, whirls lazily at its foot, and then hurries to join King's River in its journey to the desert.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the Kings and San Joaquin Rivers flow west into the arid San Joaquin Valley; however, while the San Joaquin eventually empties into San Francisco Bay, the Kings ends in the terminal sink of Tulare Lake, which ÿ before its waters were diverted for irrigation ÿ was one of the largest freshwater lakes in the western United States.[26]:208 The seasonal rise and fall of the park's rivers is driven by heavy snowfall (typically between November and April) followed by a rapid melt during May and June. Runoff drops significantly by late July (or August in wet years), and rivers are usually a trickle by autumn.[27] Snow accumulations in the higher areas of Kings Canyon National Park can be extremely large, often totaling in the hundreds of inches, although the annual snowpack fluctuates greatly between wet and dry years.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 1,200 species of plants occur in Kings Canyon and Sequoia Parks, representing about 20?percent of all plant species in the state.[28] In 1976, Kings Canyon was designated by UNESCO as part of the Sequoia-Kings Canyon Biosphere Reserve.[29][30] Due to the large range in elevation, the park is characterized by several major plant communities. At lower elevations the park touches the fairly dry Sierra foothill zone which mostly consists of chaparral, brush and shrubs. Oaks, sycamores, willows and various hardwoods are often found along streams and springs at lower elevations.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt middle elevations, most of the park consists of montane mixed-conifer forests: ponderosa pine, incense cedar, white fir, sugar pine and scattered groves of giant sequoias prevail in areas such as Cedar Grove and the mid-elevation slopes around Grant Grove.[32] In Kings Canyon, which runs almost due east to west, there is a marked difference between the north wall ÿ which is hotter and drier due to receiving more sunlight ÿ and the more cool, shaded south wall which is more heavily forested. Further up, approaching the subalpine zone, red fir and lodgepole pine are found in increasing numbers; whitebark pine, mountain hemlock and foxtail pine dominate in areas approaching the tree line.[33] A total of 202,430 acres (81,920?ha) of old-growth forests are shared by Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough its sister park to the south, Sequoia, is better known for its giant sequoias, Kings Canyon also has large stands of sequoias ÿ including General Grant, the second largest tree on Earth, in the middle of General Grant Grove.[35] The Redwood Mountain Grove, located a short distance further south, is the largest surviving sequoia grove in the world,[36]:339 covering more than 2,500 acres (1,000?ha);[37] it also has the tallest known sequoia, at 311 feet (95?m).[38] The Converse Basin Grove, located just outside the park boundary, is believed to have once been more than twice as large, but was almost completely clear-cut in the late 1800s. Many of the sequoia groves destroyed by logging, such as the Big Stump Grove, have begun to regenerate, a process that will take many hundreds of years.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe forests provide habitat to many mammal species such as mule deer, Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep, mountain lions and black bears, and a diversity of bird and reptile species.[31] The Park Service is involved in restoring the population of bighorn sheep, which are considered endangered in the area; in 2014 several bighorns were released into the Sequoia-Kings Canyon area. Grizzly bears originally roamed the park as well, but were hunted to extinction by the early 1900s.[39] The forks of the Kings River at these middle and lower elevations are also well known for their wild trout; the Kings is known as \\"one of the finest large trout fisheries in the state\\".[40]:139\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the high alpine country, plant communities are mostly meadows, herbs and shrubs with some scattered groves of foxtail pine and stunted whitebark pine. Trees often create krummholtz formations, or a stunted, deformed growth pattern characterized by branches closely hugging the ground. Talus slopes are home to small mammals such as pikas and yellow-bellied marmots. Birds such as gray-crowned rosy finches and American pipits, and sensitive amphibian species such as mountain yellow-legged frogs and Yosemite toads, feed on insects near alpine lakes and wetlands.[41] Larger animals such as bears may venture into the alpine zone in search of food (a behavior now exacerbated by improper disposal of waste by campers), but do not winter there.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough most of the park is now designated wilderness, human activities have significantly modified the ecology of the area ever since Native American times. In order to clear areas for hunting game and to encourage the germination of certain plants, Native Americans set controlled burns in areas of overgrown brush and grass. During the early 20th century, \\"\\"complete fire suppression\\" policy led to a great build-up of debris and tinder in the park's forests. By the 1960s it became apparent that this was interfering with the reproductive cycle of the park's sequoias, whose bark is fire resistant but require regular fires to clear away competing growth such as white firs. In 1963, scientists deliberately set fire to part of the Redwood Mountain Grove, the first fire in any of the park's sequoia groves for 75?years. Thousands of new sequoia seedlings germinated. The success of the experiment led to the establishment of the park's first long-term prescribed burn program in 1972.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nA major source of damage to the park in the late 19th century and early 20th century was summer livestock grazing, particularly sheep, in areas such as Tehipite Valley and the Roaring River valley (although sheep never entered Cedar Grove, due to the difficulty of accessing the bottom of Kings Canyon before Highway 180 was constructed). Ranchers drove their herds up into the Sierra Nevada to escape the drought and heat of the San Joaquin Valley.[16] Meadows were trampled by thousands of hooves, leading to increased erosion and watershed degradation.[14]:2 Grizzly bears and wolves which preyed on livestock were shot, trapped and poisoned in large numbers, extirpating them from the Sierra by the early 1900s.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Sierra Forest Reserve, including what would become Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks, was established in 1893, as many as half a million sheep were illegally grazed there. In 1917 the federal government began to crack down on illegal grazing and established a system of regulated management and range restoration, before sheep were banned from Kings Canyon altogether following the park's creation in 1940.[44] Livestock grazing is still allowed in some national forest lands around the park. Occasionally hikers may come across gated drift fences in the wilderness designed to control livestock movement. Visitors must close all gates behind them to prevent livestock from wandering into protected areas.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe decline of natural predators in the early 1900s led to a huge spike in the deer population, which further rose due to park visitors feeding them. Ultimately, this led to overgrazing and the vegetation understory was nearly eliminated in large areas of the park. When the park was expanded in 1940, the Park Service began shooting deer in an effort to reduce the size of the herd. Although the culling reduced deer numbers to a more ecologically stable level, the program was criticized for its reliance on brute force rather than more \\"hands-off\\" methods, such as re-introducing predators.[42] Today, the only stock allowed in the park are pack horses and mules, which are only permitted in certain areas along major trails, and usually not early in the season in order to protect meadows in the spring while they are wet and soft.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park continues to host a healthy population of black bears, which are typically not aggressive towards humans, but have a tendency to steal human food. The Park Service has placed bear lockers in campgrounds, required the use of bear canisters and attempted to relocate bears away from heavily visited areas. This has been successful in the backcountry, where bears have largely ceased to associate backpackers with food, but remains an issue near developed campgrounds. Visitors are encouraged to store all food and scented items in lockers, and dispose of trash in bearproof garbage cans.[14]:27 However, rangers are still sometimes forced to kill \\"problem bears\\" who become habituated to human food.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople have inhabited what is now Kings Canyon National Park for about 6,000ÿ7,000 years.[47] The Owens Valley Paiute peoples (also known as the Eastern Monos) visited the region from their homeland east of the Sierra Nevada, around Mono Lake. The Paiute mainly used acorns, found in lower elevations of the park, for food, as well as deer and other small animals. They created trade routes connecting the Owens Valley with the Central Valley west of the Sierra Nevada.[48] The Yokuts, who lived in the Central Valley, also ventured into the mountains during summer to collect plants, hunt game, and trade.[49]:204[14]:1 Because of the inhospitable winter climate, they did not establish permanent villages in the high country.[50]:46 Prior to European contact the Yokut population numbered between 15,000ÿ20,000, and the Monos about 6,000.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the 1500s AD, some of the Eastern Mono migrated across the Sierra Nevada into the Central Valley, where they created settlements adjoining Yokuts territory in the Sierra foothills near the Kings River. This group became known as the Monaches, or Western Mono.[52] They eventually divided into as many as six distinct bands, of which one, the Wobonuch, lived in the area near Grant Grove.[51] The native population suffered greatly after Europeans arrived in the 19th century (a smallpox epidemic killed off most of the Monache in 1862), and very few remain in the area today.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early Spanish exploration of California largely bypassed what is now Kings Canyon National Park. In 1805 Gabriel Moraga led an expedition through the Central Valley and crossed what is now the Kings River, bestowing the name Rio de los Santo Reyes (River of the Holy Kings) on the stream.[54][55]:5 Fur trappers also visited the areas in the 1820s, but most likely did not venture into the high country since beaver were only present at lower elevations. They were followed by prospectors during the California Gold Rush, which began in 1848. However, not much gold, nor other minerals, were discovered in this area.[56] Hale Tharp, a disillusioned gold miner, is credited with the 1858 discovery of Giant Forest in Sequoia National Park, which led to the further exploration and discovery of the other sequoia forests in the area, including Grant Grove.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1860s, a road was built to Grant Grove and many of the sequoias there were logged. The first of several sawmills opened in 1862, and logging operations expanded north and almost entirely leveled Converse Basin, then one of the largest sequoia groves in the world (although the Boole tree, the grove's biggest, was spared).[50]:46ÿ47 The General Grant tree was discovered by Joseph H. Thomas, a sawmill operator, in 1862. Thomas' business partners, the Gamlin brothers, held a claim to the land surrounding Grant Grove, and their dwelling (built around 1872) has been preserved as a historic site.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1870s a government survey \\"disclosed the remarkable quality of General Grant Grove, and Israel Gamlin was persuaded to give up his claim so the area could be preserved.\\"[50]:51 However, this did not entirely stop logging in the area ÿ in 1875 a 300-foot (91?m) sequoia was chopped down and a section sent to the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876.[50]:51 Reportedly, \\"eastern people refused to accept the exhibit as part of a single tree and called it the 'California Hoax'.\\"[58] The Centennial Stump, and most of the tree, remain as prominent features in Grant Grove: \\"Ladies from a nearby logging camp used to conduct Sunday school services for their children upon the stump.\\"[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first non-native people to venture into what is today considered the Kings Canyon backcountry or high country were likely John C. Fremont's party in 1844, which attempted to cross the Sierra Nevada by way of the Kings River. However, a snowstorm impeded their progress and they were forced to retreat to the Central Valley.[59] In 1858, the J.H. Johnson party successfully crossed the Sierra via the route Fremont had intended to find, via Kearsarge Pass at the far eastern end of Kings Canyon.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first scientific expedition to the area was the 1864 Whitney Survey, conducted by the Geological Survey of California led by William Brewer.[61] After failed attempts to summit Mount Whitney, the Brewer party descended into the Kings Canyon via Native American paths where \\"they remarked its resemblance to the Yosemite and were impressed by the enormous height of its cliffs.\\"[62] Although the rugged terrain made travel difficult, they discovered a route up the north wall of the canyon and named several prominent features, including Mount King, Mount Gardner, the Palisades, and Mount Brewer.[62] From the summit of the peak that would bear his name, Brewer described the view:\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a landscape! A hundred peaks in sight over thirteen thousand feetmany very sharpdeep canyons, cliffs in every direction almost rival Yosemite, sharp ridges inaccessible to man, on which human foot has never trodall combined to produce a view of sublimity of which is rarely equaled, one which few are privileged to behold.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrewer's party left Kings Canyon via Kearsarge Pass where they encountered a group of prospectors led by Thomas Keough.[64]:30 Although details on the Keough expedition are scarce, the miners had been prospecting on the North Fork of the Kings River and were returning to their homes in the Owens Valley, indicating that they must have crossed the Middle Fork ÿ then considered a region impossible to access by white settlers ÿ making them the first non-natives to do so.[65] Around 1869, sheepherder Frank Dusy discovered and named the Middle Fork's Tehipite Valley, and later grazed his sheep there. Aside from such occasional uses, most of the high country remained little visited and mostly unexplored.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not until John Muir first visited in 1873 that Kings Canyon began receiving public attention. Muir was delighted at the canyon's similarity to Yosemite Valley, as it reinforced his theory that the valleys were carved by massive glaciers during the last Ice Age. This competed with Josiah Whitney's then-accepted theory that the spectacular mountain valleys were formed by earthquakes.[66]:88 Muir's writings on the geology of the park and the magnificence of its sequoia groves led to calls for preservation of the area, and Muir himself continued to lobby for the cause.[67]:13 In 1880 logging claims in the Grant Grove area were suspended by the federal government, in large part due to the political efforts of Colonel George W. Stewart.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 1890 a bill (H.R. 8350) was introduced to Congress by Representative William Vandever proposing the creation of Yosemite National Park. Subsequently, some \\"political intrigue\\"[69] led to its substitution with H.R. 12187, which also included provisions for a General Grant National Park and the expansion of Sequoia National Park. The origins of this bill remain largely a mystery, although local politicians with an interest in preserving the park were likely involved. Daniel K. Zumwalt, an agent for the Southern Pacific Railroad ÿ which owned many lumber interests in California ÿ may have seen the park as a way to force their competitors in the Sequoia-Kings Canyon area out of business.[69] On October 1, 1890 President Benjamin Harrison signed the bill into law, establishing General Grant National Park ÿ the United States' fourth national park ÿ which today is part of the smaller western section of Kings Canyon National Park.[29][69]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many years the primary way for tourists to reach General Grant National Park was the Stephens Grade, a rough wagon road over which a stagecoach operated from Visalia beginning in the early 1900s. Initially, the U.S. Army had to station troops to protect the park from illegal grazing and hunting. Although these eventually ceased to be a problem, the rising number of visitors created its own sanitation and waste issues. In the summer of 1907 about 1,100 people visited the park.[70]\\r\\nA new road reached the General Grant National Park by 1913; that summer, the park saw almost 2,800 tourists.[29][71] In 1914 the park was turned over from military to civilian control (though the National Park Service was not formally established until 1916).[71][72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe future of the park's much larger eastern section remained in doubt for almost fifty years. The backcountry was largely inaccessible and unknown to tourists, requiring several days' journey on horseback through some very rugged terrain.[67]:46 Instead, the area was targeted by water supply and power interests including the city of Los Angeles, who wanted to build hydroelectric dams in Kings Canyon. Due to its heavy flow and long drop ÿ 11,000 feet (3,400?m) in less than 80 miles (130?km) ÿ the Kings River has considerable hydroelectric potential, and reservoirs were proposed for Cedar Grove, Tehipite Valley and Simpson Meadow, among other sites.[73] Development interests blocked legislation that would have made the area a national park, but at the same time, the environmental lobby prevented any of these projects from being built.[67]:15\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1935 the Generals Highway was completed connecting Sequoia and General Grant National Parks. In 1939 State Route 180 from Grant Grove to Kings Canyon was finally completed after ten years of construction, finally allowing large numbers of tourists to visit Cedar Grove for the first time. The road was built in part using state prison labor.[29] However, a proposal to extend the state highway over Kearsarge Pass to the Owens Valley was defeated.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nWell-graded hiking trails were also extended into the backcountry to replace the rough pack trails used by sheepherders ÿ including the John Muir Trail, completed in 1933 through what is now the eastern edge of Kings Canyon National Park.[75] For many years a tiny ranger station and a few private structures (such as Knapp Cabin) had been the only development in Cedar Grove. Starting in 1937, large campgrounds were developed in Kings Canyon by the U.S. Forest Service, but construction of more permanent facilities was foregone since the area would lie at the bottom of one of the proposed reservoirs.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, local opposition to Los Angeles' attempts to secure the Kings River turned into significant political pressure to create a national park, which would prevent any dam projects there. United States Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes was a major proponent for the expansion of the park, and worked to unite local interests, who had widely different views on how much development should be allowed. Ickes also hired Ansel Adams to photograph and document the area, generating publicity for the preservation movement.[77] However, in order to placate the local irrigation districts ÿ who wanted to leave open the option of reservoirs ÿ Cedar Grove and Tehipite Valley were specifically excluded from the new park. On March 4, 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the bill to create Kings Canyon National Park, which added the original General Grant National Park to over 400,000 acres (160,000?ha) of the High Sierra above Cedar Grove.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new Kings Canyon administration initially struggled to manage the huge park, which was more than 700 times the size of the original unit at Grant Grove. In the early years staff and expertise were often loaned from Sequoia National Park.[79] In 1943 the administrations of Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks were combined, as a cost-saving measure due to World War II. After the war, the arrangement was preserved; today, the two parks are still managed as one.[29] Postwar, visitation jumped enormously, from just over 82,000 in 1945 to 450,000 in 1951.[3] Demand increased for tourist facilities at Cedar Grove, the terminus of the state highway ÿ although the valley was not officially part of the park, having been omitted due to water-development interests. The extension of the road through the valley was controversial, due to potential ecological damage. By 1947 the Park Service had drafted a general plan including tourist lodges, concessions and a pack station.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nThen in 1948, Los Angeles unexpectedly re-filed its application to construct dams in Kings Canyon. The Kings River Conservation District (KRCD), representing local water agencies, immediately filed claims on the same sites. KRCD had no intention of constructing dams but hoped to block the possible threat to its water supply. Although the Federal Power Commission rejected Los Angeles' application, as it had prior to 1940, the city repeatedly refiled until 1963 when it was denied by both the California State Water Board and the federal government.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne factor in the project's final failure was that even though the Cedar Grove dam site was outside the park, the project required two additional dams to be built upstream if it were to be economically feasible. However, those sites were now inside the park boundary as designated in 1940.[82]:84 On August 6, 1965 Cedar Grove and Tehipite Valley were finally added to the park, making them permanently off-limits to new dams as well. These annexations (with the exception of a tiny section in 1984, south of Grant Grove)[83] brought Kings Canyon National Park to its present size.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in the 1950s, in response to growing traffic and crowding at national parks, the Park Service implemented Mission 66 which proposed large new visitor developments for Kings Canyon and other parks. This included new visitor centers at Grant Grove and Cedar Grove, electrification and sewage facilities at Cedar Grove, and substantial new accommodations, trails, and parking areas.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Cedar Grove development was delayed by the final years of the dam debacle, the Park Service released a new plan in 1972, which included cabins for 260 people, and an 11,000-square-foot (1,000?m2) store and cafeteria complex, hoping to develop the area in a way similar to Yosemite Valley.[85] In 1974 the park saw 1,216,800 visitors, a number that has not been exceeded since.[3] However, by 1975 public hearings showed such an opposition to intense development, that ultimately only a small lodge and store were added to the canyon.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rising number of visitors to the backcountry ÿ from 8,000 in 1962 to over 44,000 in 1971 ÿ created its own problems in the form of litter, illegal campfires and contact with dangerous wildlife such as bears. In 1966 and 1971 the Park Service proposed, controversially, to designate most of the park as wilderness, which would place much greater restrictions on its use.[87][88] In 1973 the number of backpackers was first restricted via a quota system.[89] Finally, on September 28, 1984, Congress designated over 85?percent of Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks as wilderness.[90] In 1987, the Middle and South Forks of the Kings River were designated Wild and Scenic.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrant Grove, the only vehicular entrance to the park, is 60 miles (97?km) east of Fresno via Highway 180.[92] In addition to Highway 180 from the west, Highway 198, the Generals Highway, provides access from Sequoia National Park in the south.[49]:19 The roads converge in Grant Grove Village, from where Highway 180 continues another 35 miles (56?km) northeast to Cedar Grove. There is no vehicular access from Highway 395 on the eastern side of the park. There is currently no public transportation to Kings Canyon National Park; the Big Trees Shuttle, which originally operated between Sequoia National Park and Grant Grove, is no longer in service.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Park Service maintains visitor centers at Grant Grove and Cedar Grove.[94] Grant Grove Village is the most developed part of the park and includes the 36-room John Muir Lodge (the park's largest hotel), visitor cabins, a restaurant and a general store.[95] Cedar Grove also has a small market, but overall the facilities there are much more limited.[96]:294 Barring extreme weather, the Grant Grove section is open year-round; Cedar Grove is closed in winter.[97] Highway 180 is plowed only as far as Princess Meadow, the junction with the Hume Lake Road, which remains open to Hume Lake in winter.[14]:34\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to its limited road access, Kings Canyon receives much fewer visitors than its neighboring national parks, Sequoia and Yosemite. The overall decline in national park visitation in the late 1990s hit Kings Canyon considerably harder than the other parks; from 1970 to 1990 it averaged almost a million visitors per year, but in the 21st century, it has averaged just 560,000.[3][98] In 2016, it saw an increase to 607,479 visitors, which (with the exception of 2009) was the highest count since 1995.[3][99] Since records began in 1904, an approximate total of 53 million people have visited Kings Canyon.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Grant Grove, the three major campgrounds are Azalea, Crystal Springs and Sunset, with 319 sites in total. With the exception of Sunset, they operate on a first-come, first-served basis.[100] Cedar Grove has 314 sites in the Sentinel, Sheep Creek and Moraine Campgrounds, which are also first-come, first-served; sites at the Canyon View group camp must be reserved.[101] During high demand periods, additional campsites may be placed on a reservation system. All campgrounds have flush toilets and showers, although water use may be restricted depending on the season.[100][101]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a number of popular day hikes in the parts of Kings Canyon National Park accessible by road. In the Grant Grove area a one-mile (1.6?km) trail leads to the General Grant Tree, and several longer trails reach nearby points of interest such as Redwood Mountain, the largest sequoia grove.[102] In Cedar Grove, easy hikes include the boardwalk path through Zumwalt Meadow ÿ providing broad views of Kings Canyon ÿ and the short walk to Roaring River Falls; there are also many longer day hikes such as an 8-mile (13?km) round trip to Mist Falls, and the 13-mile (21?km) round trip climb to Lookout Peak above Kings Canyon.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of historical sites in the park are easily accessible via short walks, including Gamlin Cabin, built circa 1872 by the Gamlin brothers who had a timber claim at Grant Grove before it became a national park. it is believed to be the first permanent structure built in the park area.[104] Knapp Cabin, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is the oldest surviving structure in Cedar Grove, dating back to 1925. Another point of interest is the extensive Boyden Cavern system whose entrance is located just outside the park's western boundary, in the Monarch Wilderness. As of 2016, the cave was closed due to damage from the Rough Fire.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince most of Kings Canyon is wilderness and roads extend only a small distance into the park, backpacking (and less commonly, horsepacking) are the only way to see the majority of the park. Unlike day hikers, overnight backpackers must obtain a wilderness permit from a ranger station or visitor center. During the peak tourist season (typically between May and September), a quota applies for wilderness permits, of which 75?percent are set aside for prior reservations, with the remainder for walk-ins.[14]:32 Outside the quota period permits are still required, although the limit no longer applies.[106] Although backpackers account for a relatively small percentage of the total visitors, some of the backcountry trails are still quite heavily used.[107] Due to the popularity of some backcountry camps, stays can be limited to one or two nights.[108] During the summer, the Park Service staffs backcountry ranger stations at McClure Meadow, Le Conte Meadow, Rae Lakes, Charlotte Lake and Roaring River.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoad's End at Cedar Grove is a major jumping-off point for trips into the backcountry. The Rae Lakes Loop, 41.4 miles (66.6?km), is one of the most popular backpacking trips and passes through the deep canyons of Paradise Valley, the high Woods Creek suspension bridge and exposed alpine country before reaching Rae Lakes, a chain of glacial tarns set below 13,000-foot (4,000?m) peaks.[108][14]:364 The combined Pacific Crest Trail/John Muir Trail forms the backbone of the trail system, winding about 77 miles (124?km)[109] from Piute Canyon at the park's northern tip to Forester Pass, 13,153?ft (4,009?m), in the south. Many hikes in Kings Canyon, including Rae Lakes, include parts of the PCT/JMT. There are also trailheads at Grant Grove which lead to more moderate hikes in the lower western Sierra Nevada, many in the Jennie Lakes Wilderness (just outside the national park).[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany parts of the park, such as the Middle Fork of the Kings River, are more difficult to access, requiring multi-day hikes over difficult terrain. Simpson Meadow on the Middle Fork is a 23-mile (37?km), one-way hike from Cedar Grove, with well over 12,000 feet (3,700?m) of elevation change.[111]:184 Other trailheads outside the park provide access to some of its more isolated locations, such as Tehipite Valley, a 14-mile (23?km) one-way hike from the Wishon Dam trailhead in the Sierra National Forest.[110] The 3,000-foot (910?m) exposed and unmaintained descent into the valley is \\"notorious\\"[14]:285 as one of the park's most difficult hikes.[111]:202 Several trails also access the park from the Owens Valley to the east; all surmount passes more than 11,000 feet (3,400?m) high. The closest and most heavily used eastern approach is via Onion Valley Road, which terminates about a mile (1.6?km) east of the park boundary in the Inyo National Forest. The Kearsarge Pass Trail begins at Onion Valley Campground and links to the PCT/JMT via the eponymous pass.[111]:157\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the spring and early summer, river crossings can be hazardous; in response the Park Service has installed bridges along some of the major trails. By late August or September of most years, rivers will have dropped to relatively safe levels. The high country is typically snow free between May and November, although in particularly wet years, large areas of snow may persist into July. In winter, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing are popular activities. The Park Service provides ranger-led snowshoe walks and maintains some groomed trails in the Grant Grove area. Longer trips into the backcountry are also possible, although due to the rough terrain, typically deep snows and lack of ranger patrols during the winter, this is recommended only for skilled winter travelers. As with backpacking, wilderness permits are required for any overnight trips in winter.[14]:33\\r\\n\\r\\nThe large, exposed granite cliffs and domes in Kings Canyon provide opportunities for rock climbing. However, many such features require long or circuitous hikes to reach their bases, which deters many climbers. These include The Obelisk, overlooking Kings Canyon at the park's western boundary,[111]:405 multipitch climbs at Charlito Dome and Charlotte Dome well up the Bubbs Creek Trail, and Tehipite Dome, which requires a nearly 30-mile (48?km) roundtrip hike just to access.[112][19]:376 Many of the park's prominent peaks also require technical climbing ÿ including North Palisade, the highest point in the park, and some of its neighbors along the Sierra crest.[113]:190 In The High Sierra: Peaks, Passes, Trails (2009) North Palisade is described as \\"the classic peak of the High Sierra... It is striking from a distance and has routes that will challenge climbers of all abilities and preferences.\\"[111]:248\\r\\n\\r\\nCanyoneering, bouldering, bushwhacking and rappelling are often necessary to explore parts of the backcountry without developed trails. A notably challenging route is down Enchanted Gorge in the Middle Fork backcountry, where Disappearing Creek vanishes under huge talus piles only to re-emerge several miles downstream, hence the name. Nearby Goddard Canyon is an easier ÿ albeit still rugged ÿ route, and is known for its scenic meadows and many waterfalls.[111]:268[114] The Gorge of Despair above Tehipite Valley is known for its combination of cliffs, waterfalls and deep pools, whose 3,000-foot (910?m) descent requires rappelling gear and wetsuits to achieve.[115][14]:285 Because of the park's size, lack of cell reception and limited personnel for search and rescue operations, only experienced cross-country travelers should attempt to hike off trail.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Cedar Grove, about 10 miles (16?km) of the South Fork are considered good waters for fly fishing. Although the river was once stocked with trout, the Park Service has not stocked the river since the 1970s, in favor of letting the fishery return to natural conditions.[117] While rainbow, brown, and brook trout are found in various stretches of the river, only rainbows are native to the Sierra Nevada, the others having been planted by sportsmen in the early 20th century.[7] The river is generally low and warm enough for wading by early autumn. In order to preserve the natural fishery, only catch and release is allowed for rainbows. A California state fishing license is required for visitors 16 years or older.[118] The rainbow trout in the Kings river are small, usually no more than 8 to 9 inches (20 to 23?cm).[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to protect riparian habitat, the gently flowing South Fork is closed to boating in Cedar Grove between Bubbs Creek and the western boundary of the park. However, swimming is allowed in certain sections of the river, with Muir Rock and the Red Bridge being popular swimming holes.[19]:80 Although there are many alpine lakes in the park at high elevations, most are impractical to access for boating or swimming. Nearby Hume Lake, formed by a historic mill-pond dam, is located in the Sequoia National Forest between the two sections of the park and is popular for boating, swimming and fishing.[120]:176\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the park's other rivers are extremely steep and fast-flowing, and are suitable only for advanced kayaking. The Kings River above Pine Flat Reservoir is a popular commercial whitewater run with its put-in near the western boundary of the park, but most of the run itself is on national forest. Most rivers in the park itself are inaccessible by road.[121] The Middle Fork is one of the most difficult-to-access whitewater runs in the entire state, since boats and equipment must be carried through miles of backcountry to reach it. Canoe Kayak magazine describes the Middle Fork run, which passes through some of the most isolated parts of the Sierra, as \\"the very definition of epic with paddlers traveling around the world just to make a once-in-a-lifetime descent\\".[122] Kayakers take about five days to descend the Class V Middle Fork from its 12,000-foot (3,700?m) headwaters to 900 feet (270?m) at Pine Flat Reservoir.[122]","input":"Where is sequoia and kings canyon national park located?"},{"output":"Titanic","context":"September 14, 1938 (LZ 130)\\r\\n1939 (LZ 130)\\r\\nThe two Hindenburg-class airships were hydrogen-filled, passenger-carrying rigid airships built in Germany in the 1930s and named in honor of Paul von Hindenburg. They were the last such aircraft ever built, and in terms of their length and volume, the largest Zeppelins ever to fly. During the 1930s, airships like the Hindenburg class were widely considered the future of air travel, and the lead ship of the class, LZ 129 Hindenburg, established a regular transatlantic service. The destruction of this same ship in a highly publicized accident was to prove the death knell for these expectations. The second ship, LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin, was never operated on a regular passenger service, and was scrapped in 1940 by the order of Hermann G?ring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hindenburg class were built to an all-duralumin design. The leader of the design team was Dr. Ludwig Drr, who had overseen the design of all Zeppelins except LZ-1 (on which he was a crew member), under the overall direction of Hugo Eckener, the head of the company. They were 245?m (804?ft) long and 41?m (135?ft) in diameter, longer than three Boeing 747s placed end-to-end, longer than four Goodyear GZ-20 \\"blimps\\" end-to-end, and only 24?m (79?ft) shorter than the RMS?Titanic. The previous largest civilian airship, with a length of 237?m (777?ft) and a width of 40?m (130?ft), was the British R101, which was completed in 1929. The US Navy's Akron and Macon were 239?m (785?ft) long and 44?m (144?ft) wide.\\r\\nThe design originally called for cabins for 50 passengers and a crew complement of 40.\\r\\nConstruction of the first ship, LZ 129, later named Hindenburg, began in 1931, but was suddenly stopped when Luftschiffbau Zeppelin went bankrupt. This led Eckener to make a deal with the Nazi Party which came to power in 1933. He needed money to build the airship, but in return he was forced to display the German flag on the fins. Construction then resumed in 1935. The keel of the second ship, LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin was laid on June 23, 1936, and the cells were inflated with hydrogen on August 15, 1938. As the second Zeppelin to carry the name Graf Zeppelin (after the LZ 127), she is often referred to as Graf Zeppelin II.\\r\\nThe duralumin frame was covered by cotton cloth varnished with iron oxide and cellulose acetate butyrate impregnated with aluminium powder.[citation needed] The aluminium was added to reflect both ultraviolet, which damaged the fabric, and infrared light, which caused heating of the gas. This was an innovation that was first used on the LZ 126 which was provided as war reparations to the US and served as the USS Los Angeles (ZR-3) from 1924 until decommissioned in 1933.\\r\\nThe rigid structure was held together by many large rings up to the size of a Ferris wheel, 15 of which were gas cell boundaries which formed bulkheads. These bulkheads were braced by steel wires which connected up into the axial catwalk. The longitudinal duralumin girders connected all the rings together and formed \\"panels\\". The 16 gas cells were made of cotton and a gas-tight material. On Graf Zeppelin, the cells were lightened and one was made of lightweight silk instead of cotton.\\r\\nHydrogen was vented out through valves on the top of the ship. These valves could be controlled both manually and automatically. The axial catwalk was added across the center of the ship to provide access to the gas valves. A keel catwalk provided access to the crew quarters and the engines. Alongside the keel were water ballast and fuel tanks. The tail fins of the airship were over 30?m (100?ft) in length, and were held together with a cross-like structure. The lower tail fin also had an auxiliary control room in case the controls in the gondola malfunctioned.\\r\\nHindenburg was powered by four reversible 890?kW (1,190?hp) Daimler-Benz diesel engines which gave the airship a maximum speed of 135?km/h (84?mph). Although the Graf Zeppelin had the same engine car design in its early stages of construction, the pods were later completely redesigned to power tractor propellers. The engines had a water recovery system which captured the exhaust of the engines to minimize weight lost during flight.\\r\\nTo reduce drag, the passenger rooms were contained entirely within the hull, rather than in the gondola as on the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, on two decks. The upper deck, \\"A\\", contained the passenger quarters, public areas, a dining room, a lounge, and a writing room. The lower deck, \\"B\\", contained washrooms, a mess hall for the crew, and a smoking lounge. Long slanted windows ran the length of both decks. The passenger decks were redesigned for Graf Zeppelin; the restaurant was moved to the middle of the quarters and the promenade windows were half a panel lower.\\r\\nHindenburg was originally designed for helium, heavier than hydrogen but nonflammable. In the 1920s the United States possessed a monopoly on the production of helium, obtained as a byproduct of natural gas production. The US Congress banned its export under the Helium Control Act (1927) in an effort to conserve helium for use in US Navy airships. Eckener expected this ban to be lifted, but to save helium the design was modified to have double gas cells (an inner hydrogen cell protected by an outer helium cell).[1] The ban remained however, so the engineers used only hydrogen despite its extreme flammability.[2] It held 200,000 cubic metres (7,062,000?cu?ft) of gas in 16 bags or cells with a useful lift of approximately 232?t (511,000?lb). This provided a margin above the 215?t (474,000?lb) average gross weight of the ship with fuel, equipment, 10,000?kg (22,000?lb) of mail and cargo, about 90 passengers and crew and their luggage.\\r\\nThe Germans had extensive experience with hydrogen as a lifting gas. Accidental hydrogen fires had never occurred on civilian Zeppelins, so the switch from helium to hydrogen did not cause much concern. Hydrogen also increased lift by about 8%. After the Hindenburg disaster Eckener vowed to never use hydrogen again in a passenger airship. He planned to use helium for the second ship and went to Washington, D.C. to personally lobby President Roosevelt, who promised to supply the helium only for peaceful purposes. After the annexation of Austria in March 1938, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes refused to supply the gas, and the Graf Zeppelin was also filled with hydrogen.[citation needed]\\r\\nHindenburg made her first flight on 4 March 1936, but before commencing her intended role as a passenger liner, was put to use for propaganda purposes by the Nazi government. Together with LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, she spent four days dropping leaflets, playing music, and making radio broadcasts in the lead up to the March 29 plebiscite mandating Hitler's Chancellorship and remilitarization of the Rhineland.\\r\\nCommercial services commenced on 31 March 1936 with the first of seven round trips to Rio de Janeiro that Hindenburg was to make during her first passenger season. Together with ten round trips to New York City, Hindenburg covered 308,323?km (191,583?mi) that year with 2,798 passengers and 160 tons of freight and mail.\\r\\nFollowing refurbishment during the winter, Hindenburg set out on her first flight to North America for the 1937 season (she had already made one return trip to South America in 1937) on 3 May, bound for New York. This flight would end in tragedy with Hindenburg being utterly consumed by fire as she prepared to dock at NAS Lakehurst in New Jersey.\\r\\nBy the time the Graf Zeppelin II was completed, it was obvious that the ship would never serve its intended purpose as a passenger liner; the lack of a supply of inert helium was one cause. The ship was christened and made her first flight on September 14, 1938, making a circuit from Friedrichshafen to Mnchen, Augsburg, Ulm, and back. The total distance covered was 925?km (575?mi). The Graf Zeppelin II made a total of thirty flights, mainly spy missions for the Luftwaffe.\\r\\nIn April 1940, Hermann G?ring issued the order to scrap both Graf Zeppelin's and the unfinished framework of LZ 131, since the metal was needed for other aircraft. By April 27, work crews had finished cutting up the airships. On May 6, the enormous airship hangars in Frankfurt were leveled by explosives, three years to the day after the destruction of the Hindenburg.\\r\\nGeneral characteristics\\r\\nPerformance","input":"What is bigger the titanic or the hindenburg?"},{"output":"Great Galveston Hurricane","context":"The Great Galveston Hurricane[1], known regionally as the Great Storm of 1900 [2][3][4], was a Category 4 storm, with winds of up to 145?mph (233?km/h), which made landfall on September 8, 1900, in Galveston, Texas, in the United States. It killed 6,000 to 12,000 people, making it the deadliest hurricane and natural disaster in U.S. history.\\r\\nThe hurricane appears to have started as an atmospheric trough from West Africa, causing unsettled weather in the Caribbean, and emerging into the Florida Straits as a tropical storm on September 5. Owing to contradictory forecasts, the people of Galveston felt no alarm until the official hurricane warning of September 7. The next morning, a storm surge of 15?ft (4.6?m) washed over the long, flat island-city, which was only 8?ft (2.4?m) above sea level, knocking buildings off their foundations and destroying over 3,600 homes.\\r\\nThe disaster ended the Golden Era of Galveston, as the hurricane alarmed potential investors, who turned to Houston instead. The Gulf of Mexico shoreline of Galveston island was subsequently raised by 17?ft (5.2?m) and a 10?mi (16?km) seawall erected.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hurricane of 1900 made landfall on September 8, 1900, in Galveston, Texas, in the United States.[6] It had estimated winds of 145 miles per hour (233?km/h) at landfall, making it a Category 4 storm on the SaffirÿSimpson Hurricane Scale. It was the deadliest hurricane in US history, and the second costliest hurricane in U.S. history based on the dollar's 2005 value (to compare costs with those of Hurricane Katrina and others).\\r\\nThe hurricane caused great loss of life with a death toll of between 6,000 and 12,000?people;[7] the number most cited in official reports is 8,000, giving the storm the third-highest number of deaths or injuries of all Atlantic hurricanes, after the Great Hurricane of 1780 and 1998's Hurricane Mitch. The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 is one of the deadliest natural disasters ever to strike the United States. This loss of life can be attributed to the fact that officials for the Weather Bureau in Galveston brushed off the reports because the city had \\"weathered them all\\" and they didn't realize the threat.[8] The second-deadliest storm to strike the United States, the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane, caused more than 2,500?deaths, and the deadliest storm of recent times, Hurricane Katrina, claimed the lives of approximately 1,800?people.\\r\\nThe hurricane occurred before the practice of assigning official code names to tropical storms was instituted, and thus it is commonly referred to under a variety of descriptive names. Typical names for the storm include the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, the Great Galveston Hurricane, and, especially in older documents, the Galveston Flood. It is often referred to by Galveston locals as the Great Storm or the 1900 Storm.\\r\\nThe storm's origins are unclear, because of the limited observation ability at the end of the 19th century. Ship reports were the only reliable tool for observing hurricanes at sea, and because wireless telegraphy was in its infancy, these reports were not available until the ships put in at a harbor. The 1900 storm, like many powerful Atlantic hurricanes, is believed to have begun as a Cape Verdeÿtype hurricanea tropical wave moving off the western coast of Africa. The first formal sighting of the hurricane's precursor occurred on August 27, about 1,000 miles (1,600?km) east of the Windward Islands, when a ship recorded an area of \\"unsettled weather\\". The storm passed through the Leeward Islands on August 30, probably as a tropical depression as indicated by barometric pressure reports from Antigua.[9]\\r\\nThree days later, Antigua reported a severe thunderstorm passing over, followed by the hot, humid calmness that often occurs after the passage of a tropical cyclone. By September 1, U.S. Weather Bureau observers were reporting on a \\"storm of moderate intensity (not a hurricane)\\" southeast of Cuba. Continuing westward, the storm made landfall on southwest Cuba on September 3, dropping heavy rains. On September 5, it emerged into the Florida Straits as a tropical storm or a weak hurricane.[9] The Weather Bureau ignored reports from Cuban meteorologists because they expected the storm to curve northeast along the coast of North America: \\"Assumption became fact as the official government reports stated, wrongly, that the storm was traveling northeast in the Atlantic.\\" However, a region of high pressure had pushed the storm to the west into the Gulf of Mexico.[10]\\r\\nThe storm was reported to be north of Key West on September 6,[11] and in the early morning hours of Friday, September 7, the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans, Louisiana, issued a report of heavy damage along the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts. Details of the storm were not widespread; damage to telegraph lines limited communication.[12] The Weather Bureau's central office in Washington, D.C., ordered storm warnings raised from Pensacola, Florida, to Galveston. By the afternoon of September 7, large swells from the southeast were observed on the Gulf, and clouds at all altitudes began moving in from the northeast. Both of these observations are consistent with a hurricane approaching from the east. The Galveston Weather Bureau office raised its double square flags; a hurricane warning was in effect. The ship Louisiana encountered the hurricane at 1?p.m. that day after departing New Orleans. Captain Halsey estimated wind speeds of 100?mph (160?km/h). These winds correspond to a Category?2 hurricane in the modern-day SaffirÿSimpson Hurricane Scale.[9]\\r\\nBy early afternoon on Saturday, September 8, a steady northeastern wind had picked up. By 5?p.m., the Bureau office was recording sustained hurricane-force winds. That night, the wind direction shifted to the east, and then to the southeast as the hurricane's eye began to pass over the island just west of the city. By 11?p.m., the wind was southerly and diminishing. On Sunday morning, clear skies and a 20?mph (30?km/h) breeze off the Gulf of Mexico greeted the Galveston survivors.[9] The storm continued on, and later tracked into Oklahoma. From there, it continued over the Great Lakes while still sustaining winds of almost 40?mph (as recorded over Milwaukee, Wisconsin) and passed north of Halifax, Nova Scotia, on September 12, 1900.[13] From there it traveled into the North Atlantic where it disappeared from observations,[7] after decimating a schooner fleet fishing off the coast of Newfoundland.\\r\\nAt the end of the 19th century, the city of Galveston, Texas, was a booming town with a population of 36,000?residents.[14] Its position on the natural harbor of Galveston Bay along the Gulf of Mexico made it the center of trade and one of the biggest cities in the state of Texas. With this prosperity came a sense of complacency.[12]\\r\\nA quarter of a century earlier, the nearby town of Indianola on Matagorda Bay was undergoing its own boom and was second to Galveston among Texas port cities. Then in 1875, a powerful hurricane blew through, nearly destroying the town. Indianola was rebuilt, though a second hurricane in 1886 caused residents to simply give up and move elsewhere.[15] Many Galveston residents took the destruction of Indianola as an object lesson on the threat posed by hurricanes. Galveston is built on a low, flat island, little more than a large sandbar along the Gulf Coast. These residents proposed a seawall be constructed to protect the city, but their concerns were dismissed by the majority of the population and the city's government.[16]\\r\\nSince its formal founding in 1839, the city of Galveston had weathered numerous storms, all of which the city survived with ease. Residents believed any future storms would be no worse than previous events.[17] In order to provide an official meteorological statement on the threat of hurricanes, Galveston Weather Bureau section director Isaac Cline wrote an 1891 article in the Galveston Daily News in which he argued not only that a seawall was not needed to protect the city, but also that it would be impossible for a hurricane of significant strength to strike the island.[18] The seawall was not built, and development activities on the island actively increased its vulnerability to storms. Sand dunes along the shore were cut down to fill low areas in the city, removing what little barrier there was to the Gulf of Mexico.[19]\\r\\nOn September 4, the Galveston office of the National Weather Bureau (as it was then called) began receiving warnings from the Bureau's central office in Washington, D.C., that a \\"tropical storm\\" had moved northward over Cuba. The Weather Bureau forecasters had no way of knowing where the storm was or where it was going. At the time, they discouraged the use of terms such as tornado or hurricane to avoid panicking residents in the path of any storm event. Conditions in the Gulf of Mexico were ripe for further strengthening of the storm. The Gulf had seen little cloud cover for several weeks, and the seas were as warm as bathwater, according to one report. For a storm system that feeds off moisture, the Gulf of Mexico was enough to boost the storm from a tropical storm to a hurricane in a matter of days, with further strengthening likely.[9]\\r\\nWeather Bureau forecasters believed the storm would travel northeast and affect the mid-Atlantic coast. \\"To them, the storm appeared to have begun a long turn or 'recurve' that would take it first into Florida, then drive it northeast toward an eventual exit into the Atlantic.\\"[20] Cuban forecasters adamantly disagreed, saying the hurricane would continue west. One Cuban forecaster predicted the hurricane would continue into central Texas near San Antonio. Early the next morning, the swells continued despite only partly cloudy skies. Largely because of the unremarkable weather, few residents heeded the warning. Few people evacuated across Galveston's bridges to the mainland, and the majority of the population was unconcerned by the rain clouds that began rolling in by midmorning.\\r\\nIsaac Cline claimed that he took it upon himself to travel along the beach and other low-lying areas warning people personally of the storm's approach.[21] These reports by Cline and his brother, Galveston meteorologist Joseph L. Cline,[22] have been called into question in recent years, as no other survivors corroborated these accounts. In fact, Cline's role in the disaster is the subject of some controversy. Supporters point to Cline's issuing a hurricane warning without permission from the Bureau's central office;[23] detractors (including author Erik Larson) point to Cline's earlier insistence that a seawall was unnecessary and his belief that an intense hurricane could not strike the island.\\r\\nThe first train to reach Galveston left Houston on the morning of September 8 at 9:45?a.m. It found the tracks washed out, and passengers were forced to transfer to a relief train on parallel tracks to complete their journey. Even then, debris on the track slowed the train's progress to a crawl. The 95 travelers on the train from Beaumont found themselves at the Bolivar Peninsula waiting for the ferry that would carry them, train and all, to the island. When it arrived, the high seas forced the ferry captain to give up on his attempt to dock. The train crew attempted to return the way they had come, but rising water blocked the train's path.[25]\\r\\nTen refugees from the Beaumont train sought shelter at the Point Bolivar lighthouse with 200 residents of Port Bolivar who were already there. The 85 who stayed with the train died when the storm surge overran the tops of the cars.[26]\\r\\nAt the time of the 1900 storm the highest point in the city of Galveston was only 8.7 feet (2.7?m) above sea level.[18] The hurricane brought with it a storm surge of over 15 feet (4.6?m)[28] that washed over the entire island. The surge knocked buildings off their foundations and the surf pounded them to pieces. Over 3,600?homes were destroyed[28] and a wall of debris faced the ocean.[21] The few buildings that survived, mostly solidly built mansions and houses along the Strand District, are today maintained as tourist attractions.\\r\\nThe highest measured wind speed was 100 miles per hour (160?km/h) just after 6?p.m., but the Weather Bureau's anemometer was blown off the building shortly after that measurement was recorded.[18] The eye passed over the city around 8?p.m. Maximum winds were estimated at 120?mph (190?km/h) at the time, though later estimates placed the hurricane at the higher Category?4 classification on the SaffirÿSimpson Hurricane Scale.[29] The lowest recorded barometric pressure was 28.48?inHg (964.4?hPa), considered at the time to be so low as to be obviously in error.[7] Modern estimates later placed the storm's central pressure at 27.49?inHg (930.9?hPa), but this was subsequently adjusted to the storm's official lowest measured central pressure of 27.63?inHg (935.7?hPa).[30]\\r\\nAs severe as the damage to the city's buildings was, the human toll was even greater. Because of the destruction of the bridges to the mainland and the telegraph lines, no word of the city's destruction was able to reach the mainland.[31] At 11?a.m. on September 9, one of the few ships at the Galveston wharfs to survive the storm, the Pherabe, arrived in Texas City on the western side of Galveston Bay. It carried six messengers from the city. When they reached the telegraph office in Houston at 3?a.m. on September 10, a short message was sent to Texas Governor Joseph D. Sayers and U.S. President William McKinley: \\"I have been deputized by the mayor and Citizen's Committee of Galveston to inform you that the city of Galveston is in ruins.\\" The messengers reported an estimated five hundred dead; this was considered to be an exaggeration at the time.[32]\\r\\nThe citizens of Houston knew a powerful storm had blown through and had made ready to provide assistance. Workers set out by rail and ship for the island almost immediately. Rescuers arrived to find the city completely destroyed. It is believed 8,000?people20% of the island's populationhad lost their lives.[33] Estimates range from 6,000 to 12,000.[7] Most had drowned or been crushed as the waves pounded the debris that had been their homes hours earlier. Many survived the storm itself but died after several days being trapped under the wreckage of the city, with rescuers unable to reach them. The rescuers could hear the screams of the survivors as they walked on the debris trying to rescue those they could. A further 30,000 were left homeless.[34]\\r\\nThe dead bodies were so numerous that burying all of them was impossible. The dead were initially weighted down on barges and dumped at sea, but when the gulf currents washed many of the bodies back onto the beach, a new solution was needed.[35] Funeral pyres were set up on the beaches, or wherever dead bodies were found, and burned day and night for several weeks after the storm. The authorities passed out free whiskey to sustain the distraught men conscripted for the gruesome work of collecting and burning the dead.[26] More people were killed in this single storm than the total of those killed in all the tropical cyclones that have struck the United States since. This count is greater than 300 cyclones, as of 2009. The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 remains the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history.[36]\\r\\nThe storm maintained tropical characteristics and SaffirÿSimpson tropical storm-force winds (39ÿ50?mph) when it crossed the Upper Midwest, with more than 4 inches (100?mm) of rain being reported over most of the southern third of Wisconsin. Wind created problems all over, including over Lake Michigan, and other areas in the path of the storm had similar problems. (Tropical storms reach Wisconsin and surrounding areas to the east, west, and south once every 50 years on average with others in the 19th century, 1961, and (subject to debate) Hurricane Ike in 2008; tropical depressions hit twice to three times every two years; and subtropical storms and depressions hit equally or more rarely than their tropical counterparts.)[citation needed]\\r\\nThe rapidly moving storm was still exhibiting winds of 65?mph (105?km/h) by the time it reached New York City on September 12, 1900.[37] The New York Times reported that pedestrian-walking became difficult and that one death was attributed to the storm. A sign pole, snapped by wind, landed on a 23-year-old man, crushing his skull and killing him instantly, while two others were knocked unconscious. Awnings and signs on many buildings broke and the canvas roofing at the Fire Department headquarters was blown off.[38]\\r\\nCloser to the waterfront, along the Battery seawall, waves and tides were reported to be some of the highest in recent memory of the fishermen and sailors. Spray and debris were thrown over the wall, making working along the waterfront dangerous. Small craft in New York Harbor were thrown off course and tides and currents in the Hudson River made navigation difficult. In Brooklyn, The New York Times reported that trees were uprooted, signs and similar structures were blown down, and yachts were torn from moorings with some suffering severe damage. Because of the direction of the wind, Coney Island escaped the fury of the storm, though a bathing pavilion at Bath Beach suffered damage from wind and waves.[38]\\r\\nFrom September 12ÿ14, the extratropical remnants of the Galveston hurricane affected six Canadian provinces, resulting in severe damage and extensive loss of life. Peak winds reached 50ÿ80?mph (80ÿ125?km/h) in Toronto. During the storm, a fire broke out at a flour mill in Paris, Ontario, resulting in $350,000 in damage to the mill and 50 other stores and offices. Total crop damage in Ontario alone amounted to $1?million (1900 USD). Maximum rainfall reached 3.9?inches (100?mm) in Perc, Quebec. The majority of loss of life occurred due to numerous shipwrecks off the coast of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island. The overall death toll in Canada is estimated to be between 52 and 232, making this at least the eighth deadliest hurricane to affect Canada. The large discrepancy between the fatality figures is due to the fact that many people were reported missing in Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and later presumed to be dead.[39]\\r\\nIn less than 24 hours the city of Galveston was effectively obliterated. The final death toll is not known with certainty but the most conservative estimate is around 6,000. Most historians believe the loss of life to be in the area of 8,000 with some suggesting as many as 12,000 perished. With the city in ruins and rail lines to the mainland destroyed, the survivors had little to live on until relief arrived.[43]\\r\\nSurvivors set up temporary shelters in surplus U.S. Army tents along the shore. They were so numerous that observers began referring to Galveston as the \\"White City on the Beach\\". Others constructed so-called \\"storm lumber\\" homes, using salvageable material from the debris to build shelter.[44]\\r\\nReporter Winifred Bonfils, a young journalist working for William Randolph Hearst, was the first reporter on the line at the flood's aftermath. She delivered an exclusive set of reports and Hearst sent relief supplies by train.[45]\\r\\nBy September 12, Galveston received its first post-storm mail. The next day, basic water service was restored, and Western Union began providing minimal telegraph service. Within three weeks, cotton was again being shipped out of the port.[28]\\r\\nBefore the Hurricane of 1900, Galveston was considered to be a beautiful and prestigious city and was known as the \\"Ellis Island of the West\\" and the \\"Wall Street of the Southwest\\".[46] However, after the storm, development shifted north to Houston, which was enjoying the benefits of the oil boom. The dredging of the Houston Ship Channel in 1909 and 1914 ended Galveston's hopes of regaining its former status as a major commercial center.[47]\\r\\nTo prevent future storms from causing destruction like that of the 1900 hurricane, many improvements to the island were made. The first 3 miles (4.8?km) of the Galveston Seawall, 17-foot (5?m) high, were built beginning in 1902 under the direction of Henry Martyn Robert. An all-weather bridge was constructed to the mainland to replace the ones destroyed in the storm.\\r\\nThe most dramatic effort to protect the city was its raising. Dredged sand was used to raise the city of Galveston by as much as 17 feet (5.2?m) above its previous elevation. Over 2,100?buildings were raised in the process by the process of pumping sand underneath,[21] including the 3,000-ton St. Patrick's Church. The seawall and raising of the island were jointly named a National Historical Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2001.\\r\\nIn 1915, a storm similar in strength and track to the 1900 hurricane struck Galveston. The 1915 storm brought a 12-ft (4-m) storm surge that tested the new seawall. Although 53?people on Galveston Island lost their lives in the 1915 storm, this was a great reduction from the thousands who died in 1900.[48]\\r\\nThe Galveston city government was reorganized into a commission government, a newly devised structure wherein the government is made of a small group of commissioners, each responsible for one aspect of governance. This was prompted by fears that the existing city council would be unable to handle the problem of rebuilding the city.\\r\\nToday, Galveston is home to a cruise port, two universities, and a major insurance corporation. Homes and other buildings that survived the hurricane have been preserved, and give much of the city a Victorian look. The seawall, since extended to 10 miles (16?km), is now an attraction itself, as hotels and tourist attractions have been built along its length in seeming defiance of future storms.\\r\\nThe last reported survivor of the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, Mrs. Maude Conic of Wharton, Texas, died November 14, 2004, at the claimed age of 116,[49] although the 1910 census and other records indicate she was younger than that.[50]\\r\\nIn historiography, the hurricane and the rebuilding afterward divide what is known as the Golden Era (1875ÿ1900) from the Open Era (1920ÿ1957) of Galveston. The most important long-term impact of the hurricane was to confirm fears that Galveston was a dangerous place to make major investments in shipping and manufacturing operations; the economy of the Golden Era was no longer possible as investors fled. In 1920, Prohibition and tax law enforcement opened up new opportunities for criminal enterprises related to gambling and bootlegging in the city. Galveston rapidly became a prime resort destination enabled by the open vice businesses on the island. This new entertainment-based economy brought decades-long prosperity to the island.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Galveston Historical Foundation maintains the Texas Seaport Museum at Pier 21 in the port of Galveston. Included in the museum is a documentary titled The Great Storm, that gives a recounting of the 1900 hurricane.[51][52]\\r\\nI remember now that it seemed as if we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea. As we stood there in the sandy street, my mother and I, I wanted to take my mother's hand and hurry her away. I felt as if the sea was going to break over the edge of the bowl and come puring down upon us.","input":"What is the deadliest hurricane to hit the us?"},{"output":"warm tropical to subtropical waters","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), also known as the green turtle, black (sea) turtle or Pacific green turtle,[3] is a large sea turtle of the family Cheloniidae. It is the only species in the genus Chelonia.[4] Its range extends throughout tropical and subtropical seas around the world, with two distinct populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but it is also found in the Indian Ocean.[5][6] The common name comes from the usually green fat found beneath its carapace[citation needed]; these turtles' shells are olive to black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sea turtle's dorsoventrally flattened body is covered by a large, teardrop-shaped carapace; it has a pair of large, paddle-like flippers. It is usually lightly colored, although in the eastern Pacific populations parts of the carapace can be almost black. Unlike other members of its family, such as the hawksbill sea turtle, C. mydas is mostly herbivorous. The adults usually inhabit shallow lagoons, feeding mostly on various species of seagrasses.[7] The turtles bite off the tips of the blades of seagrass, which keeps the grass healthy.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike other sea turtles, green sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding grounds and hatching beaches. Many islands worldwide are known as Turtle Island due to green sea turtles nesting on their beaches. Females crawl out on beaches, dig nests and lay eggs during the night. Later, hatchlings emerge and scramble into the water. Those that reach maturity may live to 80 years in the wild.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nC. mydas is listed as endangered by the IUCN and CITES and is protected from exploitation in most countries.[8] It is illegal to collect, harm or kill them. In addition, many countries have laws and ordinances to protect nesting areas. However, turtles are still in danger due to human activity. In some countries, turtles and their eggs are hunted for food. Pollution indirectly harms turtles at both population and individual scales, as well as light pollution. Many turtles die after being caught in fishing nets. Also, real estate development often causes habitat loss by eliminating nesting beaches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe green sea turtle is a member of the tribe Chelonini. A 1993 study clarified the status of genus Chelonia with respect to the other marine turtles. The carnivorous Eretmochelys (hawksbill), Caretta (loggerhead) and Lepidochelys (Ridley) were assigned to the tribe Carettini. Herbivorous Chelonia warranted their status as a genus, while Natator (flatback) was further removed from the other genera than previously believed.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe species was originally described by Linnaeus in 1758 as Testudo mydas.[10] In 1868, Marie Firmin Bocourt named a particular species of sea turtle Chelonia agassizii.[11][12] This \\"species\\" was referred to as the \\"black sea turtle\\".[13] Later research determined Bocourt's \\"black sea turtle\\" was not genetically distinct from C. mydas, and thus taxonomically not a separate species.[14] These two \\"species\\" were then united as Chelonia mydas and populations were given subspecies status: C. mydas mydas referred to the originally described population, while C. mydas agassizi referred only to the Pacific population known as the Galpagos green turtle.[15][16] This subdivision was later determined to be invalid and all species members were then designated Chelonia mydas.[4] The oft-mentioned name C. agassizi remains an invalid junior synonym of C. mydas. Other authorities claim that the two populations are phenotypically distinct and treat the East Pacific form as a full species.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe species' common name does not derive from any particular green external coloration of the turtle. Its name comes from the greenish color of the turtles' fat, which is only found in a layer between their inner organs and their shell.[18] As a species found worldwide, the green turtle has many local names. In the Hawaiian language it is called honu,[19][20] and it is locally known as a symbol of good luck and longevity.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nFemale returning to the sea after nesting in Redang Island, Malaysia\\r\\n\\r\\nImmature Hawaiian C. mydas\\r\\n\\r\\nSwimming in a Mexican coral reef\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading for the ocean on a beach at the Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen sea turtle near Marsa Alam, Egypt\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen sea turtle near Marsa Alam, Egypt\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen sea turtle\\r\\n\\r\\nIts appearance is that of a typical sea turtle. C. mydas has a dorsoventrally flattened body, a beaked head at the end of a short neck, and paddle-like arms well-adapted for swimming.[22] Adult green turtles grow to 1.5 metres (5?ft) long.[23] The average weight of mature individuals is 68ÿ190?kg (150ÿ419?lb) and the average carapace length is 78ÿ112?cm (31ÿ44?in).[24] Exceptional specimens can weigh 315?kg (694?lb) or even more, with the largest known C. mydas having weighed 395?kg (871?lb) and measured 153?cm (60?in) in carapace length.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnatomically, a few characteristics distinguish the green turtle from the other members of its family. Unlike the closely related hawksbill turtle, the green turtle's snout is very short and its beak is unhooked. The neck cannot be pulled into the shell.[26] The sheath of the turtle's upper jaw possesses a denticulated edge, while its lower jaw has stronger, serrated, more defined denticulation. The dorsal surface of the turtle's head has a single pair of prefrontal scales. Its carapace is composed of five central scutes flanked by four pairs of lateral scutes. Underneath, the green turtle has four pairs of inframarginal scutes covering the area between the turtle's plastron and its shell. Mature C. mydas front appendages have only a single claw (as opposed to the hawksbill's two), although a second claw is sometimes prominent in young specimens.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carapace of the turtle has various color patterns that change over time. Hatchlings of Chelonia mydas, like those of other marine turtles, have mostly black carapaces and light-colored plastrons. Carapaces of juveniles turn dark brown to olive, while those of mature adults are either entirely brown, spotted or marbled with variegated rays. Underneath, the turtle's plastron is hued yellow. C. mydas limbs are dark-colored and lined with yellow, and are usually marked with a large dark brown spot in the center of each appendage.[5][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe range of the green sea turtle extends throughout tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide. The two major subpopulations are the Atlantic and the eastern Pacific subpopulations. Each population is genetically distinct, with its own set of nesting and feeding grounds within the population's known range.[5] One of the genetic differences between the two subpopulations is the type of mitochondrial DNA found in individual's cells.  Individuals from rookeries in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea have a similar type of mitochondrial DNA, and individuals from The Pacific and Atlantic Oceans have another type of Mitochondrial DNA.[29] Their native range includes tropical to subtropical waters along continental coasts and islands between 30N and 30S. Since green sea turtles are a migrating species, their global distribution spans into the open ocean. The differences in mitochondrial DNA more than likely stems from the populations being isolated from each other by the southern tips of both South America and Africa with no warm waters for the green sea turtles to migrate through.  The green sea turtle is estimated to inhabit coastal areas of more than 140 countries, with nesting sites in over 80 countries worldwide throughout the year. In the United States Atlantic coast, green sea turtles can be found from Texas and north to Massachusetts. In the United States Pacific coast, they have been found from southern California north to the southernmost tip of Alaska. The largest populations of green sea turtles within the United States coastline are in the Hawaiian Islands and Florida. Globally, the largest populations of sea turtles are in the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the Caribbean islands.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe green sea turtle can generally be found throughout the Atlantic Ocean. Although the species is most abundant in tropical climates, individuals have been spotted as far north as Canada in the western Atlantic, and the British Isles in the east. The subpopulation's southern range is known until past the southern tip of Africa in the east and Argentina in the western Atlantic. The major nesting sites can be found on various islands in the Caribbean, along the eastern shores of the continental United States, the eastern coast of the South American continent and most notably, on isolated North Atlantic islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Caribbean, major nesting sites have been identified on Aves Island, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica. In recent years there are signs of increased nesting in the Cayman Islands.[31] One of the region's most important nesting grounds is in Tortuguero in Costa Rica.[32] In fact, the majority of the Caribbean region's C. mydas population hails from a few beaches in Tortuguero.[33] Within United States waters, minor nesting sites have been noted in the states of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and all along the east coast of Florida. Hutchinson Island in particular is a major nesting area in Florida waters. Notable locations in South America include secluded beaches in Suriname and French Guiana.[34] In the Southern Atlantic Ocean, the most notable nesting grounds for Chelonia mydas are found on the island of Ascension,[22] hosts 6,000ÿ13,000 turtle nests.[35][36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast with the sporadic distribution of nesting sites, feeding grounds are much more widely distributed throughout the region. Important feeding grounds in Florida include Indian River Lagoon, the Florida Keys, Florida Bay, Homosassa, Crystal River, and Cedar Key.[22][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Pacific, its range reaches as far north as the southern coast of Alaska and as far south as Chile in the east. The turtle's distribution in the western Pacific reaches north to Japan and southern parts of Russia's Pacific coast, and as far south as the northern tip of New Zealand and a few islands south of Tasmania. The turtles can be found throughout the Indian Ocean.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant nesting grounds are scattered throughout the entire Pacific region, including Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands, the South Pacific, the northern coast of Australia, and Southeast Asia. Major Indian Ocean nesting colonies include India, Pakistan, and other coastal countries. The east coast of the African continent hosts a few nesting grounds, including islands in the waters around Madagascar.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nNesting grounds are found all along the Mexican coast. These turtles feed in seagrass pastures in the Gulf of California.[40] Green turtles belonging to the distinct Hawaiian subpopulation nest at the protected French Frigate Shoals some 800 kilometers (500?mi) west of the Hawaiian Islands.[20] In the Philippines, green turtles nest in the Turtle Islands along with closely related hawksbill turtles.[41] Indonesia has a few nesting beaches, one in the Meru Betiri National Reserve in East Java.[42] The Coral Sea has nesting areas of world significance.[43] The Great Barrier Reef has two genetically distinct populations; one north and one south. Within the reef, twenty separate locations consisting of small islands and cays were identified as nesting sites for either population of C. mydas. Of these, the most important is on Raine Island.[44][45]\\r\\nMajor nesting sites are common on either side of the Arabian Sea, both in Ash Sharqiyah, Oman, and along the coast of Karachi, Pakistan. Some specific beaches there, such as Hawke's Bay and Sandspit, are common to both C. mydas and L. olivacea subpopulation. Sandy beaches along Sindh and Balochistan are nesting sites. Some 25 kilometers (16?mi) off the Pakistani coast, Astola island is another nesting beach.[7][46][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 December 2007, fishermen using a hulbot-hulbot (a type of fishnet) accidentally caught an 80?kg (180?lb), 93?cm (37?in) long and 82?cm (32?in) wide turtle off Barangay Bolong, Zamboanga City, Philippines. December is breeding season near the Bolong beach.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen sea turtles move across three habitat types, depending on their life stage. They lay eggs on beaches. Mature turtles spend most of their time in shallow, coastal waters with lush seagrass beds. Adults frequent inshore bays, lagoons and shoals with lush seagrass meadows. Entire generations often migrate between one pair of feeding and nesting areas.[22] Green sea turtles, Chelonia mydas, are classified as an aquatic species and are distributed around the globe in warm tropical to subtropical waters. The environmental parameter that limits the distribution of the turtles is ocean temperatures below 7 to 10 degrees Celsius.[49] Within their geographical range, the green sea turtles generally stay near continental and island coastlines. Near the coastlines, the green sea turtles live within shallow bays and protected shores. In these protected shores and bays, the green sea turtle habitats include coral reefs, salt marshes, and nearshore seagrass beds. The coral reefs provide red, brown, and green algae for their diet and gives protection from predators and rough storms within the ocean. The salt marshes and seagrass beds contain seaweed and grass vegetation, allowing ample habitat for the sea turtles.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nTurtles spend most of their first five years in convergence zones within the bare open ocean that surround them.[7][50] These young turtles are rarely seen as they swim in deep, pelagic waters.[51][52] Green sea turtles typically swim at 2.5ÿ3?km/h (1.6ÿ1.9?mph).[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs one of the first sea turtle species studied, much of what is known of sea turtle ecology comes from studies of green turtles. The ecology of C. mydas changes drastically with each stage of its life history. Newly emerged hatchlings are carnivorous, pelagic organisms, part of the open ocean mininekton. In contrast, immature juveniles and adults are commonly found in seagrass meadows closer inshore as herbivorous grazers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diet of green turtles changes with age.[54] Juveniles are carnivorous, but as they mature they become omnivorous.[55] The young eat fish eggs, molluscs, jellyfish, small invertebrates, worms, sponges, algae, and crustaceans.[56][30] Green sea turtles have a relatively slow growth rate because of the low nutritional value of their diet. Body fat turns green because of the consumed vegetation.[55] This diet shift has an effect on the green turtle's skull morphology.[57] Their serrated jaw helps them chew algae and sea grasses.[58] Most adult sea turtles are strictly herbivorous.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly human beings and the larger sharks feed on C. mydas adults. Specifically, tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) hunt adults in Hawaiian waters.[59] Juveniles and new hatchlings have significantly more predators, including crabs, small marine mammals and shorebirds.[5] Additionally, their eggs are vulnerable to predation by scavengers like red foxes and golden jackals.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen sea turtles have a variety of parasites including barnacles, leeches, protozoans, cestodes, and nematodes. Barnacles attach to the carapace, and leeches to the flippers and skin of the turtles, causing damage to the soft tissues and leading to blood loss. Protozoans, cestodes and nematodes lead to many turtle deaths because of the infections in the liver and intestinal tract they cause. The greatest disease threat to the turtle population is fibropapilloma, which produces lethal tumor growth on scales, lungs, stomach, and kidneys. Fibropapilloma is caused by a herpesvirus that is transmitted by leeches such as Ozobranchus branchiatus, a species of leech which feeds almost entirely on green sea turtles.[49][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding sites and nesting sites; some swim more than 2,600 kilometres (1,600?mi) to reach their spawning grounds. Beaches in Southeast Asia, India, islands in the western Pacific, and Central America are where Green sea turtles breed.[6] Mature turtles often return to the exact beach from which they hatched. Females usually mate every two to four years. Males, on the other hand, visit the breeding areas every year, attempting to mate.[62] Mating seasons vary between populations. For most C. mydas in the Caribbean, mating season is from June to September.[22] The French Guiana nesting subpopulation nests from March to June.[34] In the tropics, green turtles nest throughout the year, although some subpopulations prefer particular times of the year. In Pakistan, Indian Ocean turtles nest year-round, but prefer the months of July to December.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nSea turtles return to the beaches on which they were born to lay their own eggs. The reason for returning to native beaches may be that it guarantees the turtles an environment that has the necessary components for their nesting to be successful. These include a sandy beach, easy access for the hatchlings to get to the ocean, the right incubation temperatures, and low probability of predators that may feed on their eggs. Over time these turtles have evolved these tendencies to return to an area that has provided reproductive success for many generations. Their ability to return to their birthplace is known as natal homing.[63] The males also return to their birthplaces in order to mate. These males that return to their homes know they will be able to find mates because the females born there also return to breed. By doing this, the green sea turtles are able to improve their reproductive success and is why they are willing to expend the energy to travel thousands of miles across the ocean in order to reproduce.\\r\\n\\r\\nMating behaviour is similar to other marine turtles. Female turtles control the process. A few populations practice polyandry, although this does not seem to benefit hatchlings.[64] After mating in the water, the female moves above the beach's high tide line, where she digs a hole 11-22 inches in depth with her hind flippers and deposits her eggs. The hole is then covered up again.[65] Clutch size ranges between 85 and 200, depending on the age of the female. This process takes about an hour to an hour and a half. After the nest is completely covered, she returns to the sea. The female will do this 3 to 5 times in one season.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eggs are round and white, and about 45?mm in diameter. The hatchlings remain buried for days until they all emerge together at night.[65] The temperature of the nest determines the sex of the turtles before they hatch. At around 50 to 70 days,[66] the eggs hatch during the night, and the hatchlings instinctively head directly into the water. This is the most dangerous time in a turtle's life. As they walk, predators, such as gulls and crabs, feed on them. A significant percentage never make it to the ocean. Little is known of the initial life history of newly hatched sea turtles.[22] Juveniles spend three to five years in the open ocean before they settle as still-immature juveniles into their permanent shallow-water lifestyle.[51][52] It is speculated that they take twenty to fifty years to reach sexual maturity. Individuals live up to eighty years in the wild.[5] It is estimated that only 1% of hatchlings reach sexual maturity.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach year on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic, C. mydas females create 6,000 to 25,000 nests. They are among the largest green turtles in the world; many are more than a metre in length and weigh up to 300 kilograms (660?lb).[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nSea turtles spend almost all their lives submerged, but must breathe air for the oxygen needed to meet the demands of vigorous activity. With a single explosive exhalation and rapid inhalation, sea turtles can quickly replace the air in their lungs. The lungs permit a rapid exchange of oxygen and prevent gases from being trapped during deep dives. Sea turtle blood can deliver oxygen efficiently to body tissues even at the pressures encountered during diving. During routine activity, green and loggerhead turtles dive for about four to five minutes, and surface to breathe for one to three seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurtles can rest or sleep underwater for several hours at a time, but submergence time is much shorter while diving for food or to escape predators. Breath-holding ability is affected by activity and stress, which is why turtles quickly drown in shrimp trawlers and other fishing gear.[27] During the night while sleeping and to protect themselves from potential predators, the adults wedge themselves under rocks below the surface and under ledges in reefs and coastal rocks. Many green sea turtles have been observed in returning to the same sleeping location night after night.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen sea turtles tend to have good vision, well adapted to a life at sea. The turtles can see many colors, but are most sensitive to light from violet to yellow or wavelengths of 400 to 600 nanometers. They do not see many colors in the orange to red portion of the light spectrum. On land, however, the sea turtles are nearsighted because the lenses in the eyes are spherical and adjusted to refraction underwater.[30] Sea turtles have no external ear and only one ear bone, called the columella. With one ear bone, the turtles can only hear low frequency sounds, from 200 to 700?Hz. Sounds can also be detected through vibrations of the head, backbone, and shell. The nose of the turtle has two external openings and connects to the roof of the mouth through internal openings. The lower surface of the nasal passage has two sets of sensory cells called the Jacobsons organ. The turtle can use this organ to smell by pumping water in and out of its nose.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince green sea turtles migrate long distances during breeding seasons, they have special adaptive systems in order to navigate. In the open ocean, the turtles navigate using wave directions, sun light, and temperatures. The sea turtles also contain an internal magnetic compass. They can detect magnetic information by using magnetic forces acting on the magnetic crystals in their brains. Through these crystals, they can sense the intensity Earths magnetic field and are able to make their way back to their nesting grounds or preferred feeding grounds.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nNatal homing is an animal's ability to return to its birthplace in order to reproduce. Natal homing is found in all species of sea turtles and in other animals such as salmon. How these turtles are able to return to their birthplace is an interesting phenomenon. Many researchers believe that sea turtle use a process called imprinting, which is a special type of learning that occurs when turtles first hatch that allows them to recognize their native beach. There are two types of imprinting that are thought to be the reason turtles can find these beaches.The first is the chemical imprinting hypothesis. This hypothesis states that much like salmon, sea turtles are able to use olfactory cues and senses to smell their way home. However, a problem with this hypothesis is that some turtles travel thousands of miles to return to their native beaches, and the scents from that area arent likely to travel and be distinguishable from that distance. \\r\\nThe second hypothesis is the geomagnetic hypothesis. This hypothesis states that as it hatches, a young turtle will imprint on the magnetic field of the beach they are born on. This hypothesis strongly correlates to the method which sea turtles use to navigate the earth.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to tolerate the constant heat loss in the water, sea turtles have the ability to shunt blood away from tissues that are tolerant of low oxygen levels toward the heart, brain, and central nervous system. Other mechanisms include basking on warm beaches and producing heat through their activity and movements of their muscles. In the winter months, turtles living at higher latitudes can hibernate for a short period in the mud.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe green sea turtles exhibit sex differences by their development and appearance. As adult turtles, males are easily distinguishable from the females by having a longer tail (visibly extending past the shell) and longer claws on the front flippers. The hatching time and sex of the turtles are determined by the incubation temperature of the nest. Hatchings occur more quickly in nests that are warmer than nests that are in cooler conditions. Warm nesting sites above 30 degrees Celsius favor the development of females, whereas nesting sites below 30 degrees Celsius produce males. The position of the egg in the nest also affects sex-determination. Eggs in the center tend to hatch as females due to the warmer conditions within the nest.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen sea turtles play an essential role within the ecosystem in which they live. In the seagrass beds, the turtles feed on the seagrass by trimming only the top and leaving the roots of the plant. Through their feeding technique, the turtles help to improve the health and growth of the seagrass beds. The healthy seagrass beds that the turtles provide give habitat and feeding grounds for many species of fish and crustaceans. On the nesting beaches, the green sea turtles provide key nutrients for the ecosystem through their hatched egg shells. In their coral reef habitat, the green sea turtles have a symbiotic interaction with reef fish, including the yellow tang. The yellow tang fish swims along with the turtle and feeds on the algae, barnacles, and parasites on its shell and flippers. This species interaction provides food for the yellow tang and provides a necessary cleaning and smoothing of the turtles shell. This cleaning helps the turtle swim by reducing the amount of drag and improves their health.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, the turtles' skin was tanned and used to make handbags, especially in Hawaii.[20] Ancient Chinese considered the flesh of sea turtles a culinary delicacy, including and especially C. mydas.[70] Particularly for this species, the turtle's fat, cartilage, and flesh, known as calipee, are sought as ingredients for making turtle soup, a popular 19th century American dish.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Java, Indonesia, sea turtle eggs were a popular delicacy. However, the turtle's flesh is regarded as ?arm or \\"unclean\\" under Islamic law (Islam is Java's primary religion). In Bali, turtle meat was a prominent feature at ceremonial and religious feasts. Turtles were harvested in the remotest parts of the Indonesian archipelago.[71] Bali has been importing sea turtles since the 1950s, as its own turtle supplies became depleted.[72] The mostly Hindu Balinese do not eat the eggs, but sell them instead to local Muslims.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommercial farms, such as the Cayman Turtle Farm in the West Indies, once bred them for commercial sale of turtle meat, turtle oil (rendered from the fat), turtle shell, and turtle leather made from the skin. The farm's initial stock was in large part from \\"doomed\\" eggs removed from nests threatened by erosion, flooding, or in chemically hostile soil.[73] The farms held as many as 100,000 turtles at any one time. When the international markets were closed by regulations that did not allow even farm-bred turtle products to be exported internationally, the surviving farm became primarily a tourist attraction, supporting 11,000 turtles.[74] Initially started as Mariculture Ltd., then Cayman Turtle Farm Ltd and subsequently branded Boatswain's Beach, in 2010 the farm's brandname was changed to Cayman Turtle Farm: Island Wildlife Encounter.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nSea turtles are integral to the history and culture of the Cayman Islands. When the islands were first discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1503, he named them \\"Las Tortugas\\" because of the abundance of sea turtles in the waters around the islands.[76] Many of the earliest visitors came to the Cayman Islands to capture the turtles as a source of fresh meat during long voyages. The Green Turtle is a national symbol displayed as part of the Coat of Arms of the Cayman Islands, which also forms part of the national flag of the Cayman Islands. The country's currency uses a turtle as the watermark in its banknotes.[77] A stylised sea turtle nicknamed \\"Sir Turtle\\" is the mascot of the national airline Cayman Airways[78] and is part of the livery of its aircraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nA ki' pohaku (petroglyph) of a turtle (or honu) can be found on The Big Island of Hawaii in the Pu'u Loa lava fields. The green sea turtle (called Honu) has always held a special meaning for Hawaiians and this petroglyph shows its importance dating to possibly when the islands first became populated. The turtle symbolizes a navigator that can find his way home time after time. This symbol mirrors the real life of the green Hawaiian turtle as it will swim hundreds of miles to lay its eggs at its own place of birth. Though there are other myths as well, some Hawaiian legends say the honu were the first to guide the Polynesians to the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaiians revere the turtle and the legend of Kailua, a turtle who could take the form of a girl at will. In human form, she looked after the children playing on Punalu'u beach.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent decades, sea turtles have moved from unrestricted exploitation to global protection, with individual countries providing additional protection, although serious threats remain unabated.\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman action presents both intentional and unintentional threats to the species' survival. Intentional threats include continued hunting, poaching and egg harvesting. More dangerous are unintentional threats, including boat strikes, fishermen's nets that lack turtle excluder devices, pollution and habitat destruction. Chemical pollution may create tumors;[80] effluent from harbors near nesting sites may create disturbances; and light pollution may disorient hatchlings. Habitat loss usually occurs due to human development of nesting areas. Beach-front construction, land \\"reclamation\\" and increased tourism are examples of such development.[5][7] An infectious tumor-causing disease, fibropapillomatosis, is also a problem in some populations. The disease kills a sizeable fraction of those it infects, though some individuals seem to resist the disease.[20][81][82] In addition, at least in the Southwestern Atlantic (Ro de la Plata, Uruguay), exotic invasive species such as the rapa whelk Rapana venosa, were reported massively bio-fouling immature green turtles, reducing buoyancy, increasing drag, and causing severe injuries to the carapace.[83] Because of these threats, many populations are in a vulnerable state.\\r\\n\\r\\nPacific green turtles' foraging habitats are poorly understood and mostly unknown.[84] These foraging grounds are most likely along the coast of Baja California, Mexico and southern California,[85] in which these turtles have a high risk of incidental capture by coastal fisheries. The main mortality factor for these turtles is the shrimp trawlers in Mexico, in which many of these turtles go undocumented.[85] The only foraging area that has been identified is the San Diego Bay, but it is heavily polluted with metals and PCBs.[85] These contaminants have a negative effect on the ocean environment, and have been shown to cause lesions and sometimes mortality.[85] Green turtles also are threatened by entanglement and ingestion of plastic.[85] In San Diego Bay, an adult green turtle was found dead with monofilament netting tightly packed in its esophagus.[85] In addition there are indications that global climate change is affecting the ability of Green Turtle populations in Australia to produce males due to their temperature-dependent sex determination and the rising temperatures in the northern Great Barrier Reef region.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen sea turtles are the most commonly traded species along Java's south coast and are sold in the form of whole, stuffed animals or turtle oil, locally known as \\"minyak bulus\\"[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has repeatedly listed green sea turtles in its Red List under differing criteria. In 1982, they officially classified it as an endangered species.[88] The 1986,[89] 1988,[90] 1990,[91] 1994,[92] and the landmark 1996 edition of the IUCN Red List, retained the listing.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, Nicholas Mrosovsky filed a delisting petition, claiming some green turtle populations were large, stable and in some cases, increasing. At the time, the species was listed under the strict EN A1abd criteria. The IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee ruled that visual counts of nesting females could not be considered \\"direct observation\\" and thus downgraded the species' status to EN A1bdretaining the turtle's endangered status.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, the IUCN reclassified C. mydas as endangered under the EN A2bd criteria, which essentially states the wild populations face a high risk of extinction because of several factors. These factors include a probable population reduction of more than 50% over the past decade as estimated from abundance indices and by projecting exploitation levels.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 May 2007, C. mydas was listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) as a member of the family Cheloniidae.[96] The species was originally listed on Appendix II in 1975. The entire family was moved to Appendix I in 1977, with the exception of the Australian population of C. mydas. In 1981, the Australian population joined the rest. It is therefore illegal to import, export, kill, capture or harass green turtles.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mediterranean population is listed as critically endangered.[5][18] The eastern Pacific, Hawaiian and Southern California subpopulations are designated threatened. Specific Mexican subpopulations are listed as endangered. The Florida population is listed as endangered. The World Wide Fund for Nature has labeled populations in Pakistan as \\"rare and declining\\".[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the State of Hawaii, specifically on the Island of Hawaii (Hawaii County), state representative Faye Hanohano, a Native Hawaiian rights activist, pressed for a measure to delist C. mydas from protected status so that Native Hawaiians could legally harvest the turtles and possibly their eggs as well. The bill, HCR14, was largely overlooked by the media since at that point it was only a local issue. While the bill was passed in the House, the Senate's Committee on Energy and Environment refused to hear it, which meant that the bill did not go on to be heard by the Senate.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to management by global entities such as the IUCN and CITES, specific countries around the world have undertaken conservation efforts.\\r\\nBali has traditional uses that were considered sustainable, but have been questioned considering greater demand from the larger and wealthier human population. The harvest was the most intensive in the world.[71] In 1999, Indonesia restricted turtle trade and consumption because of the decreasing population and threat of a tourist boycott. It rejected a request made by Bali Governor I Made Mangku Pastika in November 2009 to set a quota of 1,000 turtles to be killed in Hindu religious ceremonies. While conservationists respect the need for turtles in rituals, they wanted a smaller quota.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nEcotourism is one initiative in Sabah, Malaysia. The island of Pulau Selingan is home to a turtle hatchery. Staff people place some of the eggs laid each night in a hatchery to protect them from predators. Incubation takes around sixty days. When the eggs hatch, tourists assist in the release of the baby turtles into the sea.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll populations are listed as \\"Threatened\\".[101][102] The Hawaiian subpopulation has made a remarkable comeback and is now one focus of ecotourism and has become something of a state mascot. Students of Hawaii Preparatory Academy on the Big Island have tagged thousands of specimens since the early 1990s.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom the species is protected by a Biodiversity Action Plan, due to excess harvesting and marine pollution.[103] The Pakistani-branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature has been initiating projects for secure turtle hatching since the 1980s. However, the population has continued to decline.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Atlantic, conservation initiatives have centered around Caribbean nesting sites. The Tortuguero nesting beaches in Costa Rica have been the subject of egg-collection limits since the 1950s. The Tortuguero National Park was formally established in 1976, in part, to protect that region's nesting grounds.[32] On Ascension Island, which contains some of the most important nesting beaches, an active conservation program has been implemented.[104] Karumb has been monitoring foraging and developmental areas of juvenile green turtles in Uruguay since 1999.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nCayman Turtle Farm located in Grand Cayman in the northwest Caribbean Sea is the first farm to have achieved the second generation of Green Sea turtles bred, laid, hatched, and raised in captivity.[106] Since its beginning in 1968, the farm has released over 31,000 turtles into the wild,[76] and each year more captive-bred turtles are released into the Caribbean Sea from beaches around the island of Grand Cayman.[107] Captive-bred turtles released from the farm as hatchlings or yearlings with \\"living tags,\\" have now begun to return to nest on Grand Cayman as adults.[108][109] On February 19, 2012 the farm released the first 2nd-generation captive-bred Green Sea turtle equipped with a Position Tracking Transponder ÿ PTT (also known as a satellite tag).[110] In addition, the farm provides turtle meat products to the local population for whom turtle has been part of the traditional cuisine for centuries. In so doing, the farm curtails the incentive to take turtles from the wild,[111] which over the years in addition to the Cayman Turtle Farm's release of captive-bred turtles has enabled an increase in the number of turtles sighted in the waters around the island of Grand Cayman and nesting on its beaches.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Pacific, green sea turtles nest on the motu (islets) in the Funafuti Conservation Area, a marine conservation area covering 33 square kilometers (12.74 square miles) of reef, lagoon and motu on the western side of Funafuti atoll in Tuvalu.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genome of Chelonia mydas was sequenced in 2013 to examine the development and evolution of the turtle body plan.[114]","input":"What is the habitat of the green sea turtle?"},{"output":"T-Mobile","context":"MetroPCS (stylized as metroPCS) is a prepaid wireless service in the United States that is part of T-Mobile US, Inc..

The power station was officially declared open on 9 February 1970 by Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India. The dam and power plant are named after the warrior Maharaja Rana Pratap of Rajasthan.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dam is located on the Chambal River near Rawatbhata in Rajasthan. The dam drains a total catchment area of 24,864?km2 (9,600?sq?mi), of which only 956?km2 (369?sq?mi) are in Rajasthan. The free catchment intercepted at this dam site, below Gandhi Sagar Dam, is 2,280?km2 (880?sq?mi).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chambal River (known in ancient times as the Charmavati River), a perennial river, which is first tapped at the Gandhi Sagar dam as part of its cascade development, raises in the Vindhya Range of hills at an elevation of 853 metres (2,799?ft), south of Mhow (15 kilometres (9.3?mi) west-southwest of Mhow). It flows north-northeast through Madhya Pradesh, runs for a time through Rajasthan, then forms the boundary between Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh before turning southeast to join the Yamuna River in Uttar Pradesh state. Its total length from source up to the confluence with the Yamuna River near Etawah at elevation (122 metres (400?ft) is 900 kilometres (560?mi).[2][5] It flows in a north-south direction for about (360 kilometres (220?mi) in Madhya Pradesh and then enters Rajasthan at Chaurasigarh about 96 kilometres (60?mi) south east from Kota and eventually joins the Yamuna River in Uttar Pradesh near Etawah.[3] The river reach of 96 kilometres (60?mi) from 344 kilometres (214?mi) to 440 kilometres (270?mi) from its source is a deep gorge section and further downstream there are plains. The Gandhi Sagar Dam is located in the middle reach of the gorge section of the river and affords good storage facility.

It took place in north India and marked the beginning of the Mughal Empire. This was one of the earliest battles involving gunpowder firearms and field artillery in the Indian subcontinent which were introduced by Mughals in this battle.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter losing Samarkand for the second time, Babur gave attention to conquer India as he reached the banks of the Chenab in 1519.[6] Until 1524, his aim was to only expand his rule to Punjab, mainly to fulfil his ancestor Timur's legacy, since it used to be part of his empire.[7] At the time parts of north India were under the rule of Ibrahim Lodi of the Lodi dynasty, but the empire was crumbling and there were many defectors. He received invitations from Daulat Khan Lodi, Governor of Punjab and Ala-ud-Din, uncle of Ibrahim.[8] He sent an ambassador to Ibrahim, claiming himself the rightful heir to the throne of the country, however the ambassador was detained at Lahore and released months later.[6]\\r\\nBabur started for Lahore, Punjab, in 1524 but found that Daulat Khan Lodi had been driven out by forces sent by Ibrahim Lodi.[9] When Babur arrived at Lahore, the Lodi army marched out and his army was routed.[9] In response, Babur burned Lahore for two days, then marched to Dipalpur, placing Alam Khan, another rebel uncle of Lodi's, as governor.[9] Alam Khan was quickly overthrown and fled to Kabul. In response, Babur supplied Alam Khan with troops who later joined up with Daulat Khan Lodi and together with about 30,000 troops, they besieged Ibrahim Lodi at Delhi.[10] He defeated them and drove off Alam's army and Babur realised Lodhi would not allow him to occupy the Punjab.[10]\\r\\nHearing of the size of Ibrahim's army, Babur secured his right flank against the city of Panipat, while digging a trench covered with tree branches to secure his left flank. In the center, he placed 700 carts tied together with ropes. Between every two carts there were breastworks for his matchlockmen. Babur also ensured there was enough space for his cavalry to charge between these carts.[11]\\r\\nWhen Ibrahim's army arrived, he found the approach to Babur's army too narrow to attack. While Ibrahim redeployed his forces to allow for the narrower front, Babur quickly took advantage of the situation to flank (tulghuma) the Lodi army.[1] Many of Ibrahim's troops were unable to get into action, and fled when the battle turned against Ibrahim.[12] Faced with musket fire, cannon fire and cavalry attacks from all sides, Ibrahim Lodi fought and died with 6,000 of his remaining troops.[1]\\r\\nBabur's guns proved decisive in battle, firstly because Ibrahim lacked any field artillery, but also because the sound of the cannon frightened Ibrahim's elephants, causing them to trample his own men.[2]\\r\\nNew tactics introduced by Babur were the tulghuma and the araba. Tulghuma meant dividing the whole army into various units, viz. the Left, the Right and the Centre. The Left and Right divisions were further subdivided into Forward and Rear divisions. Through this a small army could be used to surround the enemy from all sides. The Centre Forward division was then provided with carts (araba) which were placed in rows facing the enemy and tied to each other with animal hide ropes. Behind them were placed cannons protected and supported by mantlets which could be used to easily maneuver the cannons. These two tactics made Babur's artillery lethal. The cannons could be fired without any fear of being hit, as they were shielded by the bullock carts held in place by hide ropes. The heavy cannons could also be easily traversed onto new targets, as they could be maneuvered by the mantlets which were on wheels.\\r\\nIbrahim Lodi died on the field of battle along with 15,000 of his troops.

The 48-star flag was in effect for 47 years until the 49-star version became official on July 4, 1959. The 50-star flag was ordered by the then president Eisenhower on August 21, 1959, and was adopted in July 1960. It is the longest-used version of the U.S. flag and has been in use for over 57 years.[4]\\r\\nThe Continental Colors\\r\\n(aka the \\"Grand Union Flag\\")\\r\\nFlag of the British East India Company, 1707ÿ1801\\r\\nAt the time of the Declaration of Independence in July 1776, the Continental Congress would not legally adopt flags with \\"stars, white in a blue field\\" for another year. The flag contemporaneously known as \\"the Continental Colors\\" has historically been referred to as the first national flag.[5]\\r\\nThe Continental Navy raised the Colors as the ensign of the fledgling nation in the American War for Independencelikely with the expedient of transforming their previous British red ensigns by adding white stripesand would use this flag until 1777, when it would form the basis for the subsequent de jure designs.[5][6]\\r\\nThe name \\"Grand Union\\" was first applied to the Continental Colors by George Preble in his 1872 history of the American flag.[6]\\r\\nThe flag closely resembles the British East India Company flag of the era, and Sir Charles Fawcett argued in 1937 that the company flag inspired the design.[7] Both flags could have been easily constructed by adding white stripes to a British Red Ensign, one of the three maritime flags used throughout the British Empire at the time. However, an East India Company flag could have from nine to 13 stripes, and was not allowed to be flown outside the Indian Ocean.[8]\\r\\nIn any case, both the stripes (barry) and the stars (mullets) have precedents in classical heraldry. Mullets were comparatively rare in early modern heraldry, but an example of mullets representing territorial divisions predating the U.S. flag are those in the coat of arms of Valais of 1618, where seven mullets stood for seven districts.\\r\\nOn June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress passed the Flag Resolution which stated: \\"Resolved, That the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\\"[9] Flag Day is now observed on June 14 of each year. While scholars still argue about this, tradition holds that the new flag was first hoisted in June 1777 by the Continental Army at the Middlebrook encampment.[10]\\r\\nThe first official U.S. flag flown during battle was on August 3, 1777, at Fort Schuyler (Fort Stanwix) during the Siege of Fort Stanwix. Massachusetts reinforcements brought news of the adoption by Congress of the official flag to Fort Schuyler. Soldiers cut up their shirts to make the white stripes; scarlet material to form the red was secured from red flannel petticoats of officers' wives, while material for the blue union was secured from Capt. Abraham Swartwout's blue cloth coat. A voucher is extant that Capt. Swartwout of Dutchess County was paid by Congress for his coat for the flag.[11]\\r\\nThe 1777 resolution was most probably meant to define a naval ensign. In the late 18th century, the notion of a national flag did not yet exist, or was only nascent. The flag resolution appears between other resolutions from the Marine Committee. On May 10, 1779, Secretary of the Board of War Richard Peters expressed concern \\"it is not yet settled what is the Standard of the United States.\\"[12] However, the term, \\"Standard,\\" referred to a national standard for the Army of the United States. Each regiment was to carry the national standard in addition to its regimental standard. The national standard was not a reference to the national or naval flag.[13]\\r\\nThe Flag Resolution did not specify any particular arrangement, number of points, nor orientation for the stars and the arrangement or whether the flag had to have seven red stripes and six white ones or vice versa.[14] The appearance was up to the maker of the flag. Some flag makers arranged the stars into one big star, in a circle or in rows and some replaced a state's star with its initial.[15] One arrangement features 13 five-pointed stars arranged in a circle, with the stars arranged pointing outwards from the circle (as opposed to up), the so-called Betsy Ross flag. This flag, however, is more likely a flag used for celebrations of anniversaries of the nation's birthday. Experts have dated the earliest known example of this flag to be 1792 in a painting by John Trumbull.[16]\\r\\nDespite the 1777 resolution, the early years of American independence featured many different flags. Most were individually crafted rather than mass-produced. While there are many examples of 13-star arrangements, some of those flags included blue stripes as well as red and white. Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, in a letter dated October 3, 1778, to Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, described the American flag as consisting of \\"13 stripes, alternately red, white, and blue, a small square in the upper angle, next the flag staff, is a blue field, with 13 white stars, denoting a new Constellation.\\"[17] John Paul Jones used a variety of 13-star flags on his U.S. Navy ships including the well-documented 1779 flags of the Serapis and the Alliance. The Serapis flag had three rows of eight-pointed stars with stripes that were red, white, and blue. The flag for the Alliance, however, had five rows of eight-pointed stars with 13 red and white stripes, and the white stripes were on the outer edges.[18] Both flags were documented by the Dutch government in October 1779, making them two of the earliest known flags of 13 stars.[19]\\r\\nFrancis Hopkinson of New Jersey, a naval flag designer, and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, designed the 1777 flag[20] while he was the Chairman of the Continental Navy Board's Middle Department, sometime between his appointment to that position in November 1776 and the time that the flag resolution was adopted in June 1777. The Navy Board was under the Continental Marine Committee.[21] Not only did Hopkinson claim that he designed the U.S. flag, but he also claimed that he designed a flag for the U.S. Navy. Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime, when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work. These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting's biography of Hopkinson. Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress, via the Continental Board of Admiralty, on May 25, 1780.[22] In this letter, he asked for a \\"Quarter Cask of the Public Wine\\" as payment for designing the U.S. flag, the seal for the Admiralty Board, the seal for the Treasury Board, Continental currency, the Great Seal of the United States, and other devices. However, in three subsequent bills to Congress, Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash, but he did not list his U.S. flag design. Instead, he asked to be paid for designing the \\"great Naval Flag of the United States\\" in the first bill; the \\"Naval Flag of the United States\\" in the second bill; and \\"the Naval Flag of the States\\" in the third, along with the other items. The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed, that is, a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones. The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea. By contrast, Hopkinson's flag for the United States had seven white stripes, and six red ones ÿ in reality, six red stripes laid on a white background.[23] Hopkinson's sketches have not been found, but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty (naval) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time. His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes;[24] whereas, his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones.[25] Hopkinson's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag. Remnants of Hopkinson's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President's seal.[23] When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board, his position was like that of today's Secretary of the Navy.[26] The payment was not made, however, because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress.[27][28] This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag, which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776.[29][30] Furthermore, a letter from the War Board to George Washington on May 10, 1779, documents that there was still no design established for a national flag for the Army's use in battle.[31]\\r\\nThe origin of the stars and stripes design has been muddled by a story disseminated by the descendants of Betsy Ross. The apocryphal story credits Betsy Ross for sewing the first flag from a pencil sketch handed to her by George Washington. No evidence for this exists either in the diaries of George Washington nor in the records of the Continental Congress. Indeed, nearly a century passed before Ross' grandson, William Canby, first publicly suggested the story in 1870.[32] By her family's own admission, Ross ran an upholstery business, and she had never made a flag as of the supposed visit in June 1776.[33] Furthermore, her grandson admitted that his own search through the Journals of Congress and other official records failed to find corroboration of his grandmother's story.[34]\\r\\nThe family of Rebecca Young claimed that she sewed the first flag.[35] Young's daughter was Mary Pickersgill, who made the Star Spangled Banner Flag.[36][37] According to rumor, the Washington family coat of arms, shown in a 15th-century window of Selby Abbey, was the origin of the stars and stripes.[38]\\r\\nIn 1795, the number of stars and stripes was increased from 13 to 15 (to reflect the entry of Vermont and Kentucky as states of the Union). For a time the flag was not changed when subsequent states were admitted, probably because it was thought that this would cause too much clutter. It was the 15-star, 15-stripe flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\", later known as \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\", which is now the American national anthem. The flag is currently on display in the exhibition, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem\\" at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History in a two-story display chamber that protects the flag while it is on view.[39]\\r\\nOn April 4, 1818, a plan was passed by Congress at the suggestion of U.S. Naval Captain Samuel C. Reid[40] in which the flag was changed to have 20 stars, with a new star to be added when each new state was admitted, but the number of stripes would be reduced to 13 so as to honor the original colonies. The act specified that new flag designs should become official on the first July 4 (Independence Day) following admission of one or more new states. The most recent change, from 49 stars to 50, occurred in 1960 when the present design was chosen, after Hawaii gained statehood in August 1959. Before that, the admission of Alaska in January 1959 prompted the debut of a short-lived 49-star flag.[41]\\r\\nPrior to the adoption of the 48-star flag in 1912, there was no official arrangement of the stars in the canton, although the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy used standardized designs. Throughout the 19th century there was an abundance of different star patterns, rectangular and circular.\\r\\nOn July 4, 2007, the 50-star flag became the version of the flag in longest use, surpassing the 48-star flag that was used from 1912 to 1959.\\r\\nThe U.S. flag was brought to the city of Canton (GuҊngzhu) in China in 1784 by the merchant ship Empress of China, which carried a cargo of ginseng.[42] There it gained the designation \\"Flower Flag\\" (Chinese: ; pinyin: huq; Cantonese Yale: fke).[43] According to a pseudonymous account first published in the Boston Courier and later retold by author and U.S. naval officer George H. Preble:\\r\\nWhen the thirteen stripes and stars first appeared at Canton, much curiosity was excited among the people. News was circulated that a strange ship had arrived from the further end of the world, bearing a flag \\"as beautiful as a flower.\\" Every body went to see the kwa kee chuen [; Fkesyhn], or \\"flower flagship.\\" This name at once established itself in the language, and America is now called the kwa kee kwoh [??; Fkegwok], the \\"flower flag country\\"and an American, kwa kee kwoh yin [??; Fkegwokyhn]\\"flower flag countryman\\"a more complimentary designation than that of \\"red headed barbarian\\"the name first bestowed upon the Dutch.[44][45]\\r\\nIn the above quote, the Chinese words are written phonetically based on spoken Cantonese. The names given were common usage in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.[46] Other Asian nations have equivalent terms for America, for example Vietnamese: Hoa K? (\\"Flower Flag\\"). Chinese now refer to the United States as simplified Chinese: ˇ; traditional Chinese: ˇ??; pinyin: Migu܇. Mi is short for Miljin (simplified Chinese: ˇͫ; traditional Chinese: ˇͫ??, phono-semantic matching of \\"American\\") and \\"gu܇\\" means \\"country\\", so this name is unrelated to the flag. However, the \\"flower flag\\" terminology persists in some places today: for example, American Ginseng is called simplified Chinese: y; traditional Chinese: ??; literally: \\"flower flag ginseng\\" in Chinese, and Citibank, which opened a branch in China in 1902, is known as 跐k; \\"Flower Flag Bank\\".[46]\\r\\nThe U.S. flag took its first trip around the world in 1787ÿ90 on board the Columbia.[43] William Driver, who coined the phrase \\"Old Glory\\", took the U.S. flag around the world in 1831ÿ32.[43] The flag attracted the notice of Japanese when an oversized version was carried to Yokohama by the steamer Great Republic as part of a round-the-world journey in 1871.[47]\\r\\nIn the following table depicting the 28 various designs of the United States flag, the star patterns for the flags are merely the usual patterns, often associated with the United States Navy. Canton designs, prior to the proclamation of the 48-star flag, had no official arrangement of the stars. Furthermore, the exact colors of the flag were not standardized until 1934.[48]\\r\\nIn the November 2012 U.S. election, Puerto Rico voted to become a U.S. state. However, the legitimacy of the result of this election was disputed.[50] On June 11, 2017, another referendum was held, this time with the result that 97% of voters in Puerto Rico voted for statehood.[51][52] Similarly in November 2016, a statehood referendum was held in the District of Columbia where 86% of voters approved the proposal. If a new U.S. state were to be admitted, it would require a new design on the flag to accommodate the additional star.[53]\\r\\nThe modern meaning of the flag was forged in December 1860, when Major Robert Anderson moved the U.S. garrison from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. Author Adam Goodheart argues this was the opening move of the American Civil War, and the flag was used throughout northern states to symbolize American nationalism and rejection of secessionism.\\r\\nBefore that day, the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or a convenient marking of American territory, flown from forts, embassies, and ships, and displayed on special occasions like American Independence day. But in the weeks after Major Anderson's surprising stand, it became something different. Suddenly the Stars and Stripes flewas it does today, and especially as it did after the September 11 attacks in 2001from houses, from storefronts, from churches; above the village greens and college quads. For the first time American flags were mass-produced rather than individually stitched and even so, manufacturers could not keep up with demand. As the long winter of 1861 turned into spring, that old flag meant something new. The abstraction of the Union cause was transfigured into a physical thing: strips of cloth that millions of people would fight for, and many thousands die for.\\r\\nÿ Adam Goodheart.[54]\\r\\nThe flag of the United States is one of the nation's most widely recognized symbols. Within the United States, flags are frequently displayed not only on public buildings but on private residences. The flag is a common motif on decals for car windows, and clothing ornaments such as badges and lapel pins. Throughout the world the flag has been used in public discourse to refer to the United States.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe flag has become a powerful symbol of Americanism, and is proudly flown on many occasions, with giant outdoor flags used by retail outlets to draw customers. Desecration of the flag is considered a public outrage, but remains protected as freedom of speech. Scholars have noted the irony that \\"[t]he flag is so revered because it represents the land of the free, and that freedom includes the ability to use or abuse that flag in protest\\".[55] In worldwide comparison, Testi noted in 2010 that the United States was not unique in adoring its banner, for the flags of Scandinavian countries are also \\"beloved, domesticated, commercialized and sacralized objects\\".[56]\\r\\nThe man credited with designing the current 50 star American flag was Robert G. Heft. He was 17 years old at the time and created the flag design in 1958 as a high school class project while living with his grandparents in Ohio.[57] He received a B? on the project.[58] According to Heft, his history teacher honored their agreement to change his grade to an A after his design was selected.[59][60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic design of the current flag is specified by 4 U.S.C.??1; 4 U.S.C.??2 outlines the addition of new stars to represent new states. The specification gives the following values:\\r\\nThese specifications are contained in an executive order which, strictly speaking, governs only flags made for or by the U.S. federal government.[62] In practice, most U.S. national flags available for sale to the public have a different width-to-height ratio; common sizes are 2 G 3?ft. or 4 G 6?ft. (flag ratio 1.5), 2.5 G 4?ft. or 5 G 8?ft. (1.6), or 3 G 5?ft. or 6 G 10?ft. (1.667). Even flags flown over the U.S. Capitol for sale to the public through Representatives or Senators are provided in these sizes.[63] Flags that are made to the prescribed 1.9 ratio are often referred to as \\"G-spec\\" (for \\"government specification\\") flags.\\r\\nThe exact red, white, and blue colors to be used in the flag are specified with reference to the CAUS Standard Color Reference of America, 10th edition. Specifically, the colors are \\"White\\", \\"Old Glory Red\\", and \\"Old Glory Blue\\".[64] The CIE coordinates for the colors of the 9th edition of the Standard Color Card were formally specified in JOSA in 1946.[65] These colors form the standard for cloth, and there is no perfect way to convert them to RGB for display on screen or CMYK for printing. The \\"relative\\" coordinates in the following table were found by scaling the luminous reflectance relative to the flag's \\"white\\".\\r\\nAs with the design, the official colors are only officially required for flags produced for the U.S. federal government, and other colors are often used for mass-market flags, printed reproductions, and other products intended to evoke flag colors. The practice of using more saturated colors than the official cloth is not new. As Taylor, Knoche, and Granville wrote in 1950: \\"The color of the official wool bunting [of the blue field] is a very dark blue, but printed reproductions of the flag, as well as merchandise supposed to match the flag, present the color as a deep blue much brighter than the official wool.\\"[67]\\r\\nSometimes, Pantone Matching System (PMS) approximations to the flag colors are used. One set was given on the website of the U.S. embassy in London as early as 1998; the website of the U.S. embassy in Stockholm claimed in 2001 that those had been suggested by Pantone, and that the U.S. Government Printing Office preferred a different set. A third red was suggested by a California Military Department document in 2002.[68] In 2001, the Texas legislature specified that the colors of the Texas flag should be \\"(1) the same colors used in the United States flag; and (2) defined as numbers 193 (red) and 281 (dark blue) of the Pantone Matching System.\\"[69]\\r\\nWhen Alaska and Hawaii were being considered for statehood in the 1950s, more than 1,500 designs were submitted to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Although some of them were 49-star versions, the vast majority were 50-star proposals. At least three of these designs were identical to the present design of the 50-star flag.[71] At the time, credit was given by the executive department to the United States Army Institute of Heraldry for the design.\\r\\nOf these proposals, one created by 17-year-old Robert G. Heft in 1958 as a school project received the most publicity. His mother was a seamstress, but refused to do any of the work for him. He originally received a Bÿ for the project. After discussing the grade with his teacher, it was agreed (somewhat jokingly) that if the flag was accepted by Congress, the grade would be reconsidered. Heft's flag design was chosen and adopted by presidential proclamation after Alaska and before Hawaii was admitted into the Union in 1959.[72] According to Heft, his teacher did keep to their agreement and changed his grade to an A for the project.[60] The 49- and 50-star flags were each flown for the first time at Fort McHenry on Independence Day, in 1959 and 1960 respectively.[60]\\r\\nTraditionally, the flag may be decorated with golden fringe surrounding the perimeter of the flag as long as it does not deface the flag proper. Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in parades or on indoor posts, often use fringe to enhance the appearance of the flag.\\r\\nThe first recorded use of fringe on a flag dates from 1835, and the Army used it officially in 1895. No specific law governs the legality of fringe, but a 1925 opinion of the attorney general addresses the use of fringe (and the number of stars) \\"...?is at the discretion of the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy?...\\" as quoted from footnote in previous volumes of Title 4 of the United States Code law books and is a source for claims that such a flag is a military ensign not civilian. However, according to the Army Institute of Heraldry, which has official custody of the flag designs and makes any change ordered, there are no implications of symbolism in the use of fringe.[73] Several federal courts have upheld this conclusion,[74][75] most recently and forcefully in Colorado v. Drew, a Colorado Court of Appeals judgment that was released in May 2010.[76] Traditionally, the Army and Air Force use a fringed National Color for parade, color guard and indoor display, while the Sea Services (Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard) use a fringeless National Color for all occasions.\\r\\nThe flag is customarily flown year-round at most public buildings, and it is not unusual to find private houses flying full-size (3 by 5 feet (0.91 by 1.52?m)) flags. Some private use is year-round, but becomes widespread on civic holidays like Memorial Day, Veterans Day, Presidents' Day, Flag Day, and on Independence Day. On Memorial Day it is common to place small flags by war memorials and next to the graves of U.S. war veterans. Also on Memorial Day it is common to fly the flag at half staff, until noon, in remembrance of those who lost their lives fighting in U.S. wars.\\r\\nThe United States Flag Code outlines certain guidelines for the use, display, and disposal of the flag. For example, the flag should never be dipped to any person or thing, unless it is the ensign responding to a salute from a ship of a foreign nation. This tradition may come from the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, where countries were asked to dip their flag to King Edward VII: the American flag bearer did not. Team captain Martin Sheridan is famously quoted as saying \\"this flag dips to no earthly king\\", though the true provenance of this quotation is unclear.[77][78]\\r\\nThe flag should never be allowed to touch the ground and, if flown at night, must be illuminated. If the edges become tattered through wear, the flag should be repaired or replaced. When a flag is so tattered that it can no longer serve as a symbol of the United States, it should be destroyed in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. The American Legion and other organizations regularly conduct flag retirement ceremonies, often on Flag Day, June 14. (The Boy Scouts of America recommends that modern nylon or polyester flags be recycled instead of burned, due to hazardous gases being produced when such materials are burned.)[79]\\r\\nThe Flag Code prohibits using the flag \\"for any advertising purpose\\" and also states that the flag \\"should not be embroidered, printed, or otherwise impressed on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs, napkins, boxes, or anything intended to be discarded after temporary use\\".[80] Both of these codes are generally ignored, almost always without comment.\\r\\nSection 8, entitled Respect For Flag states in part: \\"The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery\\", and \\"No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform\\". Section 3 of the Flag Code[81] defines \\"the flag\\" as anything \\"by which the average person seeing the same without deliberation may believe the same to represent the flag of the United States of America\\".\\r\\nAn additional part of Section 8 Respect For Flag, that is frequently violated at sporting events is part (c) \\"The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.\\"\\r\\nAlthough the Flag Code is U.S. federal law, there is no penalty for a private citizen or group failing to comply with the Flag Code and it is not widely enforcedindeed, punitive enforcement would conflict with the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.[82] Passage of the proposed Flag Desecration Amendment would overrule legal precedent that has been established.\\r\\nWhen the flag is affixed to the right side of a vehicle of any kind (e.g.: cars, boats, planes, any physical object that moves), it should be oriented so that the canton is towards the front of the vehicle, as if the flag were streaming backwards from its hoist as the vehicle moves forward. Therefore, U.S. flag decals on the right sides of vehicles may appear to be reversed, with the union to the observer's right instead of left as more commonly seen.\\r\\nThe flag has been displayed on every U.S. spacecraft designed for manned flight, including Mercury, Gemini, Apollo Command/Service Module, Apollo Lunar Module, and the Space Shuttle. The flag also appeared on the S-IC first stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle used for Apollo. But since Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo were launched and landed vertically and were not capable of horizontal atmospheric flight as the Space Shuttle did on its landing approach, the \\"streaming\\" convention was not followed and these flags were oriented with the stripes running horizontally, perpendicular to the direction of flight.\\r\\nOn some U.S. military uniforms, flag patches are worn on the right shoulder, following the vehicle convention with the union toward the front. This rule dates back to the Army's early history, when both mounted cavalry and infantry units would designate a standard bearer, who carried the Colors into battle. As he charged, his forward motion caused the flag to stream back. Since the Stars and Stripes are mounted with the canton closest to the pole, that section stayed to the right, while the stripes flew to the left.[83] Several US military uniforms, such as flight suits worn by members of the United States Air Force and Navy, have the flag patch on the left shoulder.[84][85]\\r\\nOther organizations that wear flag patches on their uniforms can have the flag facing in either direction. The congressional charter of the Boy Scouts of America stipulates that the uniforms should not imitate U.S. military uniforms; consequently, the flags are displayed on the right shoulder with the stripes facing front, the reverse of the military style.[86] Law enforcement officers often wear a small flag patch, either on a shoulder, or above a shirt pocket.\\r\\nEvery U.S. astronaut since the crew of Gemini 4 has worn the flag on the left shoulder of his or her space suit, with the exception of the crew of Apollo 1, whose flags were worn on the right shoulder. In this case, the canton was on the left.\\r\\nThe flag did not appear on U.S. postal stamp issues until the Battle of White Plains Issue was released in 1926, depicting the flag with a circle of 13 stars. The 48-star flag first appeared on the General Casimir Pulaski issue of 1931, though in a small monochrome depiction. The first U.S. postage stamp to feature the flag as the sole subject was issued July 4, 1957, Scott catalog number 1094.[87] Since that time the flag has frequently appeared on U.S. stamps.\\r\\nIn 1907 Eben Appleton, New York stockbroker and grandson of Lieutenant Colonel George Armistead (the commander of Fort McHenry during the 1814 bombardment) loaned the Star Spangled Banner Flag to the Smithsonian Institution, and in 1912 he converted the loan to a gift. Appleton donated the flag with the wish that it would always be on view to the public. In 1994, the National Museum of American History determined that the Star Spangled Banner Flag required further conservation treatment to remain on public display. In 1998 teams of museum conservators, curators, and other specialists helped move the flag from its home in the Museum's Flag Hall into a new conservation laboratory. Following the reopening of the National Museum of American History on November 21, 2008, the flag is now on display in a special exhibition, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem,\\" where it rests at a 10 degree angle in dim light for conservation purposes.[39]\\r\\nBy presidential proclamation, acts of Congress, and custom, U.S. flags are displayed continuously at certain locations.\\r\\nThe flag should especially be displayed at full staff on the following days:[103]\\r\\nThe flag is displayed at half-staff (half-mast in naval usage) as a sign of respect or mourning. Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president; statewide or territory-wide, the proclamation is made by the governor. In addition, there is no prohibition against municipal governments, private businesses or citizens flying the flag at half-staff as a local sign of respect and mourning. However, many flag enthusiasts feel this type of practice has somewhat diminished the meaning of the original intent of lowering the flag to honor those who held high positions in federal or state offices. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first proclamation on March 1, 1954, standardizing the dates and time periods for flying the flag at half-staff from all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels; other congressional resolutions and presidential proclamations ensued. However, they are only guidelines to all other entities: typically followed at state and local government facilities, and encouraged of private businesses and citizens.\\r\\nTo properly fly the flag at half-staff, one should first briefly hoist it top of the staff, then lower it to the half-staff position, halfway between the top and bottom of the staff. Similarly, when the flag is to be lowered from half-staff, it should be first briefly hoisted to the top of the staff.[107]\\r\\nFederal statutes provide that the flag should be flown at half-staff on the following dates:\\r\\nNational Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, on July 27, was formerly a day of half-staff observance until the law expired in 2003. In 2009, it became a day of full-staff observance.[104][113][114]\\r\\nThough not part of the official Flag Code, according to military custom, flags should be folded into a triangular shape when not in use. To properly fold the flag:\\r\\nThere is also no specific meaning for each fold of the flag. However, there are scripts read by non-government organizations and also by the Air Force that are used during the flag folding ceremony. These scripts range from historical timelines of the flag to religious themes.[115][116]\\r\\nTraditionally, the flag of the United States plays a role in military funerals,[117] and occasionally in funerals of other civil servants (such as law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and U.S. presidents). A burial flag is draped over the deceased's casket as a pall during services. Just prior to the casket being lowered into the ground, the flag is ceremonially folded and presented to the deceased's next of kin as a token of respect.[118]\\r\\nFlag of Bikini Atoll\\r\\nFlag of Liberia\\r\\nFlag of Malaysia\\r\\nFlag of El Salvador 1875ÿ1912\\r\\nFlag of Brittany","input":"How many stars are on the american flag 2017?"},{"output":"on 1 July 2007","context":"A smoking ban in England, making it illegal to smoke in all enclosed work places in England, came into force on 1 July 2007 as a consequence of the Health Act 2006. Similar bans had already been introduced by the rest of the United Kingdom: in Scotland on 26 March 2006, Wales on 2 April 2007 and Northern Ireland on 30 April 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the ban many businesses voluntarily introduced bans on smoking mainly as a result of public feedback. The pub chain Wetherspoons was the first major chain to introduce a complete ban on indoor smoking.[1]\\r\\nTobacco advertising had been banned in England gradually starting with a ban on Television Advertising of cigarettes in 1965 to a complete ban on all Tobacco Advertising in 2005.\\r\\nOn 16 November 2004 a Public Health white paper proposed a smoking ban in almost all public places in England and Wales. Smoking restrictions would be phased in, with a ban on smoking in NHS and government buildings by 2006, in enclosed public places by 2007, and pubs, bars and restaurants (except pubs not serving food) by the end of 2008.[2]\\r\\nOn 26 October 2005, after external challenge and debates within the Cabinet, the government announced that it would continue with its plans. All workplaces, including restaurants and pubs selling food, would have to comply by summer 2007[3] However, there was widespread criticism from all sides of the argument on this, with a number of MPs threatening to try to overturn the bill. Many representatives of the licensed trade told the Government that only a total ban would work, and over 90 MPs signed a motion demanding this, with over 100 signing a petition for a free vote on the issue. It was reported on 24 November that Chief Medical Officer Liam Donaldson nearly quit over the partial ban, but decided to stay to champion a total ban.[4] On the same day, the government released the results of the public consultation, after Cancer Research UK demanded them under the Freedom of Information Act, which revealed that nearly 9 out of 10 respondents wanted a total ban.[4]\\r\\nOn 11 January 2006, the government further announced that it would give MPs a free vote on an amendment to the Health Bill, submitted by the Health select committee, to instigate a comprehensive smoke-free workplace regulations. Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt voted in favour of the amendment and, in so doing, voted against her own Department's then publicly stated policy (i.e. the proposed partial regulations). All other parties had offered free votes on the issue which was debated on 14 February, with three options: the present compromise, a total ban, or an exemption for members' clubs only.\\r\\nOn 14 February 2006, the House of Commons first voted on the amendment to the original compromise plan, to extend the ban to all enclosed public places except private members' clubs. The amendment was carried with a large majority. MPs then voted on a further amendment to ban smoking in all enclosed public places including private members' clubs. Again this amendment gained significant support and was carried with a large majority. This therefore replaced the earlier successful amendment which would have allowed smoking only in private members' clubs. The legislation was passed by the House of Lords, allowing a total smoking ban in enclosed public places to come into force in England.\\r\\nPolitical opposition did not entirely disappear at this point, the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee accused the Government of overreacting to the threat posed by passive smoking and said that the smoking ban was symptomatic of MPs' failure to understand risk[5] on 7 June 2006.\\r\\nThe ban came into force on 1 July 2007, as announced on 30 November 2006 by former Secretary of State for Health Patricia Hewitt, who called it \\"a huge step forward for public health\\".[3]\\r\\nOn 30 June 2010, the recently formed Coalition Government announced that it would not be reviewing the ban.[6] An attempt in October 2010 by Conservative MP David Nuttall to amend the law to exempt private members' clubs and pubs from the smoking ban was defeated in the House of Commons on its first reading.[7]\\r\\nWhile the ban affects almost all indoor workplaces,[8] some exemptions were provided:[9]\\r\\nAn exemption was also theoretically possible within the Palace of Westminster,[10] as for other Royal Palaces, although members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords agreed to observe the spirit of the ban and restrict any smoking within the grounds of Parliament to four designated outside areas.[11]\\r\\nSmoking is permitted in a private residence, although not in areas used as a shared work-space. In flats with communal entrances or shared corridors, these must be smoke-free.\\r\\nUniversity halls of residence presented some dilemmas in practice as regards defining what is public and private. Several universities have imposed a blanket ban on smoking including halls of residence.[12]\\r\\nAs part of the implementation of the smoking ban, Transport for London announced that smoking would be no longer permitted on taxis, private hire vehicles and all London Buses premises, including all bus stop shelters.[13]\\r\\nThe Association of Train Operating Companies and Network Rail introduced an extended ban on smoking covering all railway property including all National Rail station platforms whether enclosed or not.[14] The ban has since been extended to cover the use of Electronic cigarettes.[15] Smoking on board trains was banned in 2005 when both GNER and First Caledonian Sleeper withdrew smoking accommodation from their services.[16][17]\\r\\nThe Tyne and Wear Metro was the first public transport system to ban in its entirety which has been enforced since the system first opened in 1980.[18]\\r\\nThe ban is enforced by Environmental Health Officers in England, who issue warnings and offer advice before resorting to punitive measures and have had to issue a low frequency of fines since the law came into force. However, there were some objectors who generated higher-profile legal cases, for instance Hugh Howitt, also known as Hamish Howitt, the landlord of the Happy Scots Bar in Blackpool who was the first landlord to be prosecuted for permitting smoking in a smoke-free place under his control. On 2 August 2007, Howitt appeared before Blackpool Magistrates' Court and pleaded not guilty to 12 counts of failing to stop people smoking in his pub. On 2 December 2008, Howitt effectively had his premises licence revoked, after an appeal by Blackpool Council was upheld; he was not allowed to appeal, and Howitt had to close the Delboys Bar following the decision.[19][20]\\r\\nThere have been some incidents of violence perpetrated by people refusing to obey the ban, in one of which a former heavyweight boxer, James Oyebola, was shot in the head after he asked a customer at a nightclub to stop smoking[21] and later died of his injuries.[22] However, the view of enforcement authorities is that the smoke-free workplace regulations are simple to understand, popular, and as a result largely 'self-policing'. For a short while, bars in the UK that offered shisha (the smoking of flavoured tobacco through a pipe) were still allowed to provide their services inside the establishment, however the ban covered this area in late 2007 leading to a rapid decline in shisha bars.\\r\\nA legal blunder by Stoke-on-Trent City Council meant that, while the smoking ban still applied in the city, the council were unable to issue fines to people caught flouting the law until 16 July 2007.[23] The blunder caused the city to briefly be dubbed Smoke-on-Trent.[24]\\r\\nA group calling themselves \\"Freedom To Choose\\", launched a campaign for a judicial review of the smoke-free workplace regulations[25] claiming a breach of the Human Rights Act 1998, as it does not respect the right to privacy of people who wish to smoke in public.[26] Supporters of the regulations put forward counter-arguments positing that the rights of smokers to indulge in their habit cease as soon as it negatively affects other people in the vicinity.[27] In 2010 pub landlord Nick Hogan was jailed for an offence related to the smoking ban.[28] In 2012 it was reported that \\"Five years after the introduction of the smoking ban in England, almost seven out of 10 licensees want the legislation amended to allow for separate smoking rooms in pubs\\".[29]","input":"When was smoking banned in public places uk?"},{"output":"desert","context":"The Arabian Peninsula, simplified Arabia[1] (Arabic: ?????? ???????????? ?????????????? shibhu l-jazؐrati l-?arabiyyah, Arabian island or Arabic: ????????? ????????? jazؐratu l-?arab, Island of the Arabs),[2] is a peninsula of Western Asia situated northeast of Africa on the Arabian plate. From a geographical perspective, it is considered a subcontinent of Asia.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the largest peninsula in the world, at 3,237,500?km2 (1,250,000?sq?mi).[5][6][7][8][9] The Arabian Peninsula consists of the countries Yemen, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and parts of Jordan and Iraq.[10] The peninsula formed as a result of the rifting of the Red Sea between 56 and 23 million years ago, and is bordered by the Red Sea to the west and southwest, the Persian Gulf to the northeast, the Levant to the north and the Indian Ocean to the southeast. The Arabian Peninsula plays a critical geopolitical role in the Middle East and the Arab world due to its vast reserves of oil and natural gas.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the modern era, it was divided into four distinct regions: Hejaz (Tihamah), Najd (Al-Yamama), Southern Arabia (Hadhramaut) and Eastern Arabia. Hejaz and Najd make up most of Saudi Arabia. Southern Arabia consists of Yemen and some parts of Saudi Arabia (Najran, Jizan, Asir) and Oman (Dhofar). Eastern Arabia consists of the entire coastal strip of the Persian Gulf.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Arabian Peninsula is located in the continent of Asia and bounded by (clockwise) the Persian Gulf on the northeast, the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman on the east, the Arabian Sea on the southeast and south, the Gulf of Aden on the south, the Bab-el-Mandeb strait on the southwest and the Red Sea, which is located on the southwest and west.[11] The northern portion of the peninsula merges with the Syrian Desert with no clear border line, although the northern boundary of the Arabian Peninsula is generally considered to be the northern borders of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most prominent feature of the peninsula is desert, but in the southwest there are mountain ranges, which receive greater rainfall than the rest of the Arabian Peninsula. Harrat ash Shaam is a large volcanic field that extends from the northwestern Arabian Peninsula into Jordan and southern Syria.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peninsula's constituent countries are (clockwise north to south) Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on the east, Oman on the southeast, Yemen on the south and Saudi Arabia at the center.[11] The island nation of Bahrain lies off the east coast of the peninsula.\\r\\n\\r\\nSix countries (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Oman) form the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia covers the greater part of the peninsula. The majority of the population of the peninsula live in Saudi Arabia and in Yemen. The peninsula contains the world's largest reserves of oil. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are economically the wealthiest in the region. Qatar, a small peninsula in the Persian Gulf on the larger peninsula, is home of the Arabic-language television station Al Jazeera and its English-language subsidiary Al Jazeera English. Kuwait, on the border with Iraq, is an important country strategically, forming one of the main staging grounds for coalition forces mounting the invasion of Iraq in 2003.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough historically lightly populated, political Arabia is noted for a high population growth rate ÿ as the result of both very strong inflows of migrant labor as well as sustained high birth rates. The population tends to be relatively young and heavily skewed gender ratio dominated by males. In many states, the number of South Asians exceeds that of the local citizenry. The four smallest states (by area), which have their entire coastlines on the Persian Gulf, exhibit the world's most extreme population growth, roughly tripling every 20 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, the estimated population of the Arabian Peninsula was 77,983,936 (including expatriates).[17] The Arabian Peninsula  is known for having one of the most uneven adult sex ratios in the world with females in some regions (especially the east) constituting only a quarter of vicenarians and tricenarians.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nListed here are the human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups in Arabia (Yemen,[19] Oman,[20] Qatar,[21] Kuwait,[22] Saudi Arabia[23] and the United Arab Emirates) [24][25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nHaplogroup J is the most abundant component in the Arabian peninsula, embracing more than 50% of its Y-chromosomes. Its two main subclades (J1-M267 and J2-M172), show opposite latitudinal gradients in the Middle East. J1-M267 is more abundant in the southern areas, reaching a frequency around 73% in Yemen, whereas J2-M172 is more common in the Levant.\\r\\n\\r\\nJ (L222.2) Accounts for the majority of (L147.1) in Saudi Arabia.

The rocks exposed vary systematically across Arabia, with the oldest rocks exposed in the Arabian-Nubian Shield near the Red Sea, overlain by earlier sediments that become younger towards the Persian Gulf. Perhaps the best-preserved ophiolite on Earth, the Semail Ophiolite, lies exposed in the mountains of the UAE and northern Oman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peninsula consists of:\\r\\n\\r\\nArabia has few lakes or permanent rivers. Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called wadis, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient aquifers exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, oases form (e.g. Al-Hasa and Qatif, two of the world's largest oases) and permit agriculture, especially palm trees, which allowed the peninsula to produce more dates than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and arid, although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data (2003ÿ2013) analysed in a University of California, Irvine (UCI)-led study published in Water Resources Research on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the Arabian Aquifer System, upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.[30] Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers \\"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\\" and thirteen of them are \\"considered significantly distressed.\\"[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nA plateau more than 2,500 feet (760?m) high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula. The plateau slopes eastwards from the massive, rifted escarpment along the coast of the Red Sea, to the shallow waters of the Persian Gulf. The interior is characterised by cuestas and valleys, drained by a system of wadis. A crescent of sand and gravel deserts lies to the east.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the Arabian Peninsula is unsuited to agriculture, making irrigation and land reclamation projects essential. The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, coffee and tropical fruits. Goat, sheep, and camel husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid tropical monsoon climate, in particular the Dhofar and Al Mahrah areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical monsoon rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid desert climate or arid steppe climate. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally tropical sea with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in symbiosis with the Red Sea coral, the protozoa and zooxanthellae, have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the indopacific coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the Persian Gulf, mostly caused by phosphate water pollution and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage[citation needed].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at 10,000 feet (3,000?m). In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and khat cultivation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Hellenistic period, the area was known as Arabia or Aravia (Greek: ʽϫ?ϫ). The Romans named three regions with the prefix \\"Arabia\\", encompassing a larger area than the current term \\"Arabian Peninsula\\":\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region. Because its use became limited to the south, the whole peninsula was simply called Arabia. Arabia Deserta was the entire desert region extending north from Arabia Felix to Palmyra and the Euphrates, including all the area between Pelusium on the Nile and Babylon. This area was also called Arabia and not sharply distinguished from the peninsula.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Arabs and the Ottoman Empire considered the west of the Arabian Peninsula region where the Arabs lived 'the land of the Arabs' ÿ Bilad al-Arab (Arabia), and its major divisions were the bilad al-Sham (Syria), bilad al-Yaman (the Land of the southern Peninsula), and Bilad al-Iraq and modern-day Kuwait (the Land of the River Banks).[32] The Ottomans used the term Arabistan in a broad sense for the subcontinent itself starting from Cilicia, where the Euphrates river makes its descent into Syria, through Palestine, and on through the remainder of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe provinces of Arabia were: Al Tih, the Sinai peninsula, Hedjaz, Asir, Yemen, Hadramaut, Mahra and Shilu, Oman, Hasa, Bahrain, Dahna, Nufud, the Hammad, which included the deserts of Syria, Mesopotamia and Babylonia.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of the Arabian Peninsula goes back to the beginnings of human habitation in Arabia up to 130,000 years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is evidence that human habitation in the Arabian Peninsula dates back to about 106,000 to 130,000 years ago.[36] However, the harsh climate historically prevented much settlement in pre-Islamic Arabian peninsula, apart from a small number of urban trading settlements, such as Mecca and Medina, located in the Hejaz in the west of the peninsula.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, archaeology has revealed the existence of many civilizations in pre-Islamic Arabia (such as Thamud), especially in South Arabia.[38][39] South Arabian civilizations include Sheba, Himyarite Kingdom, Kingdom of Awsan, Kingdom of Ma'ؐn and Sabaean Kingdom. Central Arabia was the location of Kingdom of Kindah in the 4th, 5th and early 6th centuries AD. Eastern Arabia was home to the Dilmun civilization. The earliest known events in Arabian history are migrations from the Peninsula into neighbouring areas.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Arabian peninsula has long been accepted as the original Urheimat of the Semitic languages by a majority of scholars.[41][42][43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Shamir of Dhu-Raydan and Himyar had called in the help of the clans of Habashat for against the kings of Saba; but Ilmuqah granted... the submission of Shamir of Dhu-Raydan and the clans of Habashat.\\"[45]\\r\\nThe seventh century saw the introduction of Islam to the Arabian Peninsula. The Islamic prophet Muhammad, was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but migrated to Medina in 622. From there he and his companions united the tribes of Arabia under the banner of Islam and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest Indian subcontinent, across Central Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, southern Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula, to the Pyrenees.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuhammad began preaching Islam at Mecca before migrating to Medina, from where he united the tribes of Arabia into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. Umar ibn al-Khattab, a prominent companion of Muhammad, nominated Abu Bakr, who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first caliph. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that Ali ibn Abi Talib, his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by Byzantine (or Eastern Roman Empire) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the Ridda wars, or \\"Wars of Apostasy\\".[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, Abu Bakr became leader of the Muslims as the first Caliph. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the Ridda wars, or \\"Wars of Apostasy\\"), Abu Bakr attacked the Byzantine Empire. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by Umar as caliph, followed by Uthman ibn al-Affan and Ali ibn Abi Talib. The period of these first four caliphs is known as al-khulaf' ar-rshidn: the Rashidun or \\"rightly guided\\" Caliphate. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their Umayyad successors, the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the Byzantine army and destroyed the Persian Empire, conquering huge swathes of territory from the Iberian peninsula to India. The political focus of the Muslim world then shifted to the newly conquered territories.[47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, Mecca and Medina remained the spiritually most important places in the Muslim world. The Qur'an requires every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it, as one of the five pillars of Islam, to make a pilgrimage, or Hajj, to Mecca during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah at least once in his or her lifetime.[49] The Masjid al-Haram (the Grand Mosque) in Mecca is the location of the Kaaba, Islam's holiest site, and the Masjid al-Nabawi (the Prophet's Mosque) in Medina is the location of Muhammad tomb; as a result, from the 7th century, Mecca and Medina became the pilgrimage destinations for large numbers of Muslims from across the Islamic world.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite its spiritual importance, in political terms Arabia soon became a peripheral region of the Islamic world, in which the most important medieval Islamic states were based at various times in such far away cities as Damascus, Baghdad, and Cairo.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, from the 10th century (and, in fact, until the 20th century) the Hashemite Sharifs of Mecca maintained a state in the most developed part of the region, the Hejaz. Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of Mecca and Medina but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the Hejaz. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the Hejaz, they were usually subject to the suzerainty of one of the major Islamic empires of the time. In the Middle Ages, these included the Abbasids of Baghdad, and the Fatimids, Ayyubids and Mamluks of Egypt.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe provincial Ottoman Army for Arabia (Arabistan Ordusu) was headquartered in Syria, which included Palestine, the Transjordan region in addition to Lebanon (Mount Lebanon was, however, a semi-autonomous mutasarrifate). It was put in charge of Syria, Cilicia, Iraq, and the remainder of the Arabian Peninsula.[52][53] The Ottomans never had any control over central Arabia, also known as the Najd region.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Damascus Protocol of 1914 provides an illustration of the regional relationships. Arabs living in one of the existing districts of the Arabian peninsula, the Emirate of Hejaz, asked for a British guarantee of independence. Their proposal included all Arab lands south of a line roughly corresponding to the northern frontiers of present-day Syria and Iraq. They envisioned a new Arab state, or confederation of states, adjoining the southern Arabian Peninsula. It would have comprised Cilicia ÿ ?skenderun and Mersin, Iraq with Kuwait, Syria, Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, Jordan, and Palestine.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the modern era, the term bilad al-Yaman came to refer specifically to the southwestern parts of the peninsula. Arab geographers started to refer to the whole peninsula as 'jazirat al-Arab', or the peninsula of the Arabs.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, the Ottomans embarked on an ambitious project: the construction of a railway connecting Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire and the seat of the Islamic Caliphate, and Hejaz with its holiest shrines of Islam which are the yearly pilgrimage destination of the Hajj. Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hejaz Railway was a narrow gauge railway (1050?mm) that ran from Damascus to Medina, through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of Mecca, but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the Ottoman railway network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the Haydarpa?a Terminal).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II and was built largely by the Turks, with German advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a waqf, an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major developments of the early 20th century were the Arab Revolt during World War I and the subsequent collapse and partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. The Arab Revolt (1916ÿ1918) was initiated by the Sherif Hussein ibn Ali with the aim of securing independence from the ruling Ottoman Empire and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from Aleppo in Syria to Aden in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese events were followed by the unification of Saudi Arabia under King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured Riyadh. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, Jabal Shammar, Hejaz between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of Saudi Arabia. The Saudis absorbed the Emirate of Asir, with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a war with Yemen. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of Yemen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North Yemen Civil War was fought in North Yemen between royalists of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen and factions of the Yemen Arab Republic from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a coup d'tat carried out by the republican leader, Abdullah as-Sallal, which dethroned the newly crowned Muhammad al-Badr and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the Saudi Arabian border and rallied popular support.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by Egypt and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the Six-Day War of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1970, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia recognized the republic and a truce was signed. Egyptian military historians refer to the war in Yemen as their Vietnam.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait.[58] The invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi forces led to the 1990ÿ91 Gulf War. Egypt, Qatar, Syria and Saudi Arabia joined a multinational coalition that opposed Iraq. Displays of support for Iraq by Jordan and Palestine resulted in strained relations between many of the Arab states. After the war, a so-called \\"Damascus Declaration\\" formalized an alliance for future joint Arab defensive actions between Egypt, Syria, and the GCC member states.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extraction and refining of oil and gas are the major industrial activities in the Arabian Peninsula. The region also has an active construction sector, with many cities reflecting the wealth generated by the oil industry. The service sector is dominated by financial and technical institutions, which, like the construction sector, mainly serve the oil industry. Traditional handicrafts such as carpet-weaving are found in rural areas of Arabia.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 23N 46E? / ?23N 46E? / 23; 46","input":"What geographic feature covers most of the arabian peninsula?"},{"output":"a musical recording that contains more tracks than a single, but is usually unqualified as an album or LP","context":"An extended play record, often referred to as an EP, is a musical recording that contains more tracks than a single, but is usually unqualified as an album or LP.[1][2][3] EPs generally contain a minimum of four tracks and maximum of six tracks,[4] and are considered \\"less expensive and time-consuming\\" for an artist to produce than an album.[3] An EP originally referred to specific types of vinyl records other than 78 rpm standard play (SP) and LP,[5] but it is now applied to mid-length CDs and downloads as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nRicardo Baca of The Denver Post said, \\"EPsoriginally extended-play 'single' releases that are shorter than traditional albumshave long been popular with punk and indie bands.\\"[6] In the United Kingdom, the Official Chart Company defines a boundary between EP and album classification at 25 minutes of maximum length or four tracks (not counting alternative versions of featured songs, if present).[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nEPs were released in various sizes in different eras. The earliest multi-track records, issued around 1919 by Grey Gull Records, were vertically cut 78 rpm discs known as \\"2-in-1\\" records. These had finer than usual grooves, like Edison Disc Records.

These were usually 10-inch LPs (released until the mid-1950s) split onto two seven-inch EPs or 12-inch LPs split onto three seven-inch EPs, either sold separately or together in gatefold covers. This practice became much less common with the advent of triple-speed-available phonographs.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome classical music albums released at the beginning of the LP era were also distributed as EP albumsnotably, the seven operas that Arturo Toscanini conducted on radio between 1944 and 1954. These opera EPs, originally broadcast on the NBC Radio network and manufactured by RCA, which owned the NBC network then, were made available both in 45 rpm and 33?1?3?rpm. In the 1990s, they began appearing on compact discs. RCA also had success in the format with their top money earner, Elvis Presley, issuing 28 Elvis EPs between 1956 and 1967, many of which topped the separate Billboard EP chart during its brief existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1950s, RCA published several EP albums of Walt Disney movies, containing both the story and the songs. These usually featured the original casts of actors and actresses. Each album contained two seven-inch records, plus a fully illustrated booklet containing the text of the recording, so that children could follow along by reading. Some of the titles included Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio (1940), and what was then a recent release, the movie version of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea that was presented in 1954. The recording and publishing of 20,000 was unusual: it did not employ the movie's cast, and years later, a 12 in 33??rpm album, with a nearly identical script, but another different cast, was sold by Disneyland Records in conjunction with the re-release of the movie in 1963.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the popularity of 7\\" and other formats, SP (78?rpm, 10\\") records became less popular and the production of SPs in Japan was suspended in 1963.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, EPs were usually compilations of singles or album samplers and were typically played at 45?rpm on seven-inch (18?cm) discs, with two songs on each side.[9][10]\\r\\nOther than those published by RCA, EPs were relatively uncommon in the United States and Canada, but they were widely sold in the United Kingdom, and in some other European countries, during the 1950s and 1960s. Record Retailer printed the first EP chart in 1960. The New Musical Express (NME), Melody Maker, Disc and Music Echo and the Record Mirror continued to list EPs on their respective singles charts. The Beatles' Twist and Shout outsold most singles for some weeks in 1963. When the BBC and Record Retailer commissioned the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) to compile a chart it was restricted to singles and EPs disappeared from the listings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Philippines, seven-inch EPs marketed as \\"mini-LPs\\" (but distinctly different from the mini-LPs of the 1980s) were introduced in 1970, with tracks selected from an album and packaging resembling the album they were taken from.[11] This mini-LP format also became popular in America in the early 1970s for promotional releases, and also for use in jukeboxes.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nStevie Wonder included a bonus four-song EP with his double LP Songs in the Key of Life in 1976. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was less standardization and EPs were made on seven-inch (18?cm), 10-inch (25?cm) or 12-inch (30?cm) discs running either 33?1?3 or 45?rpm. Some novelty EPs used odd shapes and colors, and a few of them were picture discs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice in Chains was the first band to ever have an EP reach number one on the Billboard album chart. Its EP, Jar of Flies, was released on January 25, 1994. In 2004, Linkin Park and Jay-Z's collaboration EP, Collision Course, was the next to reach the number one spot after Alice in Chains. In 2010, the cast of the television series Glee became the first artist to have two EPs reach number one, with Glee: The Music, The Power of Madonna on the week of May 8, 2010, and Glee: The Music, Journey to Regionals on the week of June 26, 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, Warner Bros. Records revived the format with their \\"Six-Pak\\" offering of six songs on a compact disc.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first EPs were seven-inch vinyl records with more tracks than a normal single (typically five to nine\\r\\nof them). Although they shared size and speed with singles, they were a recognizably different format than the seven-inch single. Although they could be named after a lead track, they were generally given a different title.[9] Examples include The Beatles' The Beatles' Hits EP from 1963, and The Troggs' Troggs Tops EP from 1966, both of which collected previously released tracks.[9] The playing time was generally between 10 and 15 minutes.[9] They also came in cardboard picture sleeves at a time when singles were usually issued in paper company sleeves. EPs tended to be album samplers or collections of singles. EPs of all original material began to appear in the 1950s. Examples are Elvis Presley's Love Me Tender from 1956 and \\"Just for You\\", \\"Peace in the Valley\\" and \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" from 1957, and The Kinks' Kinksize Session from 1964.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwelve-inch EPs were similar, but generally had between three and five tracks and a length of over 12 minutes.[9] Like seven-inch EPs, these were given titles.[9] EP releases were also issued in cassette and 10-inch vinyl formats.[9] With the advent of the compact disc (CD), more music was often included on \\"single\\" releases, with four or five tracks being common, and playing times of up to 25 minutes.[9] These extended-length singles became known as maxi singles and while commensurate in length to an EP were distinguished by being designed to feature a single song, with the remaining songs considered B-sides, whereas an EP was designed not to feature a single song, instead resembling a mini album.\\r\\n\\r\\nEPs of original material regained popularity in the punk rock era, when they were commonly used for the release of new material, e.g. Buzzcocks' Spiral Scratch EP.[9] These featured four-track seven-inch singles played at 33?1?3?rpm, the most common understanding of the term EP.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in the 1980s, many so-called \\"singles\\" have been sold in formats with more than two tracks. Because of this, the definition of an EP is not determined only by the number of tracks or the playing time; an EP is typically seen[by whom?] as four (or more) tracks of equal importance, as opposed to a four-track single with an obvious A-side and three B-sides.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the Recording Industry Association of America, the organization that declares releases \\"gold\\" or \\"platinum\\" based on numbers of sales, defines an EP as containing three to five songs or under 30 minutes.[14] On the other hand, The Recording Academy's rules for Grammy Awards state that any release with five or more different songs and a running time of over 15 minutes is considered an album, with no mention of EPs.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, any record with more than four distinct tracks or with a playing time of more than 25 minutes is classified as an album for sales-chart purposes. If priced as a single, they will not qualify for the main album chart but can appear in the separate Budget Albums chart.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn intermediate format between EPs and full-length LPs is the mini-LP, which was a common album format in the 1980s. These generally contained 20ÿ30 minutes of music.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn underground dance music, vinyl EPs have been a longstanding medium for releasing new material, e.g. Fourteenth Century Sky by The Dust Brothers.\\r\\n\\r\\nA double extended play is the name typically given to vinyl records or compact discs released as a set of two discs, each of which would normally qualify as an EP. The name is thus analogous to double album. As vinyl records, the most common format for the double EP, they consist of a pair of 7\\" discs recorded at 45 or 33?1?3rpm, or two 12\\" discs recorded at 45?rpm. The format is useful when an album's-worth of material is being pressed by a small plant geared for the production of singles rather than albums, and may have novelty value which can be turned to advantage for publicity purposes. Double EPs are rare, since the amount of material recordable on a double EP could usually be more economically and sensibly recorded on a single vinyl LP.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1950s, Capitol Records had released a number of double EPs by its more popular artists, including Les Paul. The pair of double EPs (EBF 1-577, sides 1 to 8!) were described on the original covers as \\"parts... of a four part album\\". In 1960, Joe Meek's I Hear a New World double EP was released in 1960 and has since become a collector's item. Probably the most well-known double EP is The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour, released as a double 7\\" EP in the United Kingdom eleven days after the long-playing version, which became the standard for compact disc reissue, was released in the United States. The Style Council album The Cost of Loving was originally issued as two 12\\" EPs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is becoming less uncommon to release two 12\\" 45s rather than a single 12\\" LP. Though there are 11 songs that total about 40 minutes, enough for one LP, the songs are spread across two 12\\" 45?rpm discs. Also, the vinyl pressing of Hail to the Thief by Radiohead uses this practice but is considered to be a full-length album. In 1982 Cabaret Voltaire released their studio album \\"2x45\\" on the UK-based label Rough Trade, featuring extended tracks over four sides of two 12\\" 45?rpm discs, with graphics by artist Neville Brody.  The band subsequently released a further album in this format, 1985's \\"Drinking Gasoline\\", on the Virgin Records label.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a limited number of double EPs which serve other purposes,[which?] however. An example of this is the Dunedin Double EP, which contains tracks by four different bands. Using a double EP in this instance allowed each band to have its tracks occupying a different side. In addition, the groove on the physical record could be wider and thus allow for a louder album.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, record companies released EP versions of long-play (LP) albums for use in jukeboxes. These were commonly known as \\"compact 33s\\" or \\"little LPs\\". They played at 33?1?3?rpm, were pressed on seven-inch vinyl and frequently had as many as six songs. What made them EP-like was that some songs were omitted for time purposes, and the tracks deemed the most popular were left on. Unlike most EPs before them, and most seven-inch vinyl in general (pre-1970s), these were issued in stereo.","input":"What is a ep in the music industry?"},{"output":"April 9, 1965","context":"The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was passed as a part of United States President Lyndon B. Johnson's \\"War on Poverty\\" and has been the most far-reaching federal legislation affecting education ever passed by the United States Congress. The act was an extensive statute that funded primary and secondary education.[1] It also emphasizes equal access to education and establishes high standards and accountability.[2]\\r\\nIn addition, the bill aimed to shorten the achievement gaps between students by providing each child with fair-equal opportunities to achieve an exceptional education. As mandated in the act, the funds are authorized for professional development, instructional materials, for resources to support educational programs, and for parental involvement promotion.\\r\\nThe act was originally authorized through 1965; however, the government has reauthorized the act every five years since its enactment. The reauthorization of ESEA by President George W. Bush was known as the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. ESEA was reauthorized on December 10, 2015 as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) by President Barack Obama.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 25, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson Congressional to improve education opportunities for America's children. Wary of popular fears regarding increased federal involvement in local schools, the Johnson administration advocated giving local districts great leeway to use the new funds, which were to be first distributed as grants to each state. Shortly thereafter, Carl D. Perkins (D-KY), the chair of the General Education Subcommittee of the House Committee on Education and Labor introduced H.R. 2362. With the Johnson administration's support, and after significant wrangling over the structure of the bill's funding formula committee, the full committee voted 23ÿ8 to report it on March 2, 1965. Following a failed attempt to derail the bill by Representative Howard K. Smith (D-VA), the House passed H.R. 2362 on March 26, 1965 in a 263ÿ153 roll-call vote.[4]\\r\\nAs the Senate prepared to consider the education bill, S. 370, Democratic leaders urged their colleagues to pass it without amendment, so as to avoid throwing it back to the House for reconsideration. S. 370 was assigned to the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee, which subsequently reported the bill to the Senate floor with unanimous support. During the Senate debates, several amendments were introduced, though none passed. The Senate passed the bill in a 73ÿ18 vote on April 7, 1965.[4]\\r\\nPresident Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act into law two days later on April 9, 1965.[4]\\r\\nNew Titles Created by Early Amendments to 1965 Law\\r\\nTitle I (\\"Title One\\"), a provision of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act passed in 1965, is a program created by the U.S. Department of Education to distribute funding to schools and school districts with a high percentage of students from low-income families. Funding is distributed first to state educational agencies (SEAs) which then allocate funds to local educational agencies (LEA's) which in turn dispense funds to public schools in need.[6] Title I also helps children from families that have migrated to the United States and youth from intervention programs who are neglected or at risk of abuse. The act appropriates money for educational purposes for the next five fiscal years until it is reauthorized.[7] In addition, Title I appropriates money to the education system for prevention of dropouts and the improvement of schools; these appropriations are carried out for five fiscal years until reauthorization.[7][8]\\r\\nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics, to be an eligible Title I school, at least 40% of a school's students must be from low-income families who qualify under the United States Census's definition of low-income, according to the U.S. Department of Education.[6][9]\\r\\nTitle I mandates services both to eligible public school students and eligible private school students.[6] This is outlined in section 1120 of Title I, Part A of the ESEA as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). Title I states that it gives priority to schools that are in obvious need of funds, low-achieving schools, and schools that demonstrate a commitment to improving their education standards and test scores.\\r\\nThere are two types of assistance that can be provided by Title I funds.[6] The first is a schoolwide program in which schools can dispense resources in a flexible manner.[10] The second is a targeted assistance program which allows schools to identify students who are failing or at risk of failing.[6]\\r\\nAssistance for school improvement includes government grants, allocations, and reallocations based on the school's willingness to commit to improving their standing in the educational system. Each educational institution requesting these grants must submit an application that describes how these funds will be used in restructuring their school for academic improvement.[8]\\r\\nSchools receiving Title I funding are regulated by federal legislation. Most recently, this legislation includes the No Child Left Behind Act, which was passed in 2001.[6] In the 2006ÿ2007 school year, Title I provided assistance to over 17 million students who range from kindergarten through twelfth grade.[6] The majority of the funds (60%) were given to students between kindergarten through fifth grade.[6] The next highest group that received funding were students in sixth through eighth grade (21%).[6] Finally, 16% of the funds went to students in high school with 3% provided to students in preschool.[6]\\r\\nIn its original conception, Title I under the ESEA, was designed by President Lyndon B. Johnson to close the skill gap in reading, writing and mathematics between children from low-income households who attend urban or rural school systems and children from the middle-class who attend suburban school systems.[10] This federal law came about during President Johnsons War on Poverty agenda.[7] Numerous studies have been conducted since the original authorization of the ESEA in 1965 that have shown that there is an inverse relationship between student achievement and school poverty.[7] Specifically, student achievement has been found to decrease as school poverty increases.[7] According to the United States Department of Education (USDOE), students from low-income households are three times as likely to be low achievers if they attend high-poverty schools as compared to low-poverty schools.[11] Within this context, Title I was conceived in order to compensate for the considerable educational deprivations associated with child poverty.[7]\\r\\nIn the years since 1965, Title I has changed considerably.[12] For the first 15 years, the program was reauthorized every three years with additional emphasis placed on how funds were to be allocated.[12] In the course of these reauthorizations, strict federal rules and regulations were created for the guarantee that funds would be allocated solely to students in need ÿ specifically students eligible for services based on socioeconomic status and academic achievement.[12]\\r\\nRegulations also included added attention to uniformity in regards to how resources were distributed to Title I and non-Title he schools and the role of parents in the revisions of the program.[12] In addition to more stringent rules, during these years, policy makers outlined punitive actions that could be taken for those who were out of compliance.[12] Attention was also placed upon the assurance that Title I funds would not serve as replacements for local funds; but rather they would serve as ancillary resources.[12] These federal regulations, which were focused on financial resources, influenced local Title I programs in many ways.[12] Pull-out programs were adopted by Title I schools in order to comply with the financial stipulations that were made in the initial reauthorizations.[12] These programs separated eligible students from ineligible ones to ensure that those who were in-need would benefit from the program.[12] By 1978, in response to the extensive criticism of pull-outs on the grounds that they were asynchronous with the instruction occurring in Template:Classrooms, another option for providing assistance to students was introduced, the school wide approach.[12] Schools with a student body in which the make-up had 100% or more low-income students could use Title I funds for the entire schools improvement rather than for specific individuals.[12] Despite this amendment, local fund requirements prevented all eligible students from using the school wide approach.\\r\\nDuring the Reagan Administration, Congress passed the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA) in 1981 to reduce federal regulations of Title I.[13] This reflected the administrations stance that resource control should be in the hands of states and local jurisdictions rather than at a federal level.[13] Despite the change outlined by the ECIA and the new designation of Title I as Chapter I, little was done to implement it and traditional Title I practices, like the use of pull-outs, continued.[12]\\r\\nAs the financial regulations became incorporated into practice, the conversation shifted around Title I to student achievement.[12] In 1988, the Hawkins-Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Act, re-focused Title I on cultivating school improvement and excellent programs.[12] The additions that were made through this legislation called for synchrony between Chapter I and classroom instruction, it raised the achievement standard for low-income students by emphasizing advanced skills instead of basic ones and increased parental involvement.[12] It also had two new provisions: program improvement and school wide projects.[14] Program improvements were modifications that would occur when students who received funding were not improving.[14] The school wide projects altered the requirement that local funds had to match school wide program funding by Title I, allowing a larger number of high need schools to implement school wide programming.[12][14]\\r\\nA 1993 National Assessment noted shortcomings of the 1980s alterations to Title I.[12] These catalyzed the introduction of the 1994 Improving Americas Schools Act (IASA), which significantly revised the original ESEA.\\r\\nThis was the last major alteration prior to those made by No Child Left Behind. The IASA attempted to coordinate federal resources and policies with the pre-exisiting efforts at the state and local levels in order to improve instruction for all students. This reform made three major changes to Title I.[12] It added math and reading/language arts standards to be used to assess student progress and provide accountability.[12] It reduced the threshold for schools to implement school-wide programs from 75% poverty to 50% and gave schools a longer reign to use federal funding from multiple programs to dispense funds at a school wide level.[12] Lastly, the IASA gave more local control overall so that federal officials and states could waive federal requirements that interfered with school improvements.[12]\\r\\nThe most recent and significant alteration to the original Title I was made by its reauthorization under No Child Left Behind (NCLB).[15] In this reauthorization, NCLB required increased accountability from its schools both from the teachers and from the students.[15] Yearly standardized tests were mandated in order to measure how schools were performing against the achievement bars set by Title I.[15] Schools were also responsible for publishing annual report cards that detailed their student achievement data and demographics.[15] Schools were now held accountable not only by punitive measures that would be taken if schools fail to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP), but also corrective actions were taken if states did not have an assessment system approved by Title I.[15] Under NCLB, Schools are also required to plan for restructuring if they fail to make AYP for three years after being identified for improvement.[15] More schools took corrective action under NCLB than under IASA.[15] NCLB also required teachers to be highly qualified if hired using Title I funding.[15]\\r\\nModern applications of the Title I money have been diverse. Recent uses include wide-scale purchasing of iPads and other Internet using devices as electronic textbooks for students in 1:1 initiatives. Along with this, students from low-income families often do not have adequate Internet access from home. Thus, various public money, including Title I funds, are being investigated for possible use to provide cellular Internet access for students to receive remediation or other instructional content from home. The purpose of 24/7 internet access from home is to close the gap between higher income families where remediation resources are generally more available through parents and additional services and low-income students where such resources are scarce. Educational Technology advocates have long cited 24/7 Internet access as a boon to the education and advancement of at-risk children.\\r\\nUnder NCLB, Title I funding is given to schools where at least 35% of the children in the school attendance area come from low-income families or to schools where 35% of the student population is low-income.[16] To determine the percentage of low-income families, school districts may select a poverty measure from among the following data sources: (1) the number of children ages 5ÿ17 in poverty counted in the most recent census; (2) the number of children eligible for free and reduced price lunches under the National School Lunch Program; (3) the number of children in families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; (4) the number of children eligible to receive Medicaid assistance; or (5) a composite of these data sources. The district must use the same measure to rank all its school attendance areas. The funds are appropriated for the use of improving academic achievement for students in low-income households.[16]\\r\\nTitle I funding is received by more than 50% of all public schools.[16] NCLB also requires that for funding to be received, all districts and schools must meet adequate yearly progress goals for their student populations and specific demographic subgroups.[16] Non-Title I schools are schools that do not receive federal Title I funds.[16] Although school districts have some freedom in how Title I funding is distributed among schools within a district, Title I requires them to prioritize the highest-poverty schools.[16]\\r\\nThere are 4 distribution formulas under NCLB for Title I funding: Basic Grant, Concentration Grant, Targeted Assistance Grant, and the Education Finance Incentive Grant.[17] The Federal Education Budget Project details the requirements for each formula extensively.[17]\\r\\nThe Basic Grant formula provides funding to school districts based on the number of poor children they serve.[17] To receive money through this grant, the school district must meet the requirement of having at least 10 poor children and 2% of its students in poverty.[17]\\r\\nThe Concentration Grant formula is similar to the basic grant formula because it gives funding to schools based on the number of poor children they serve.[17] To receive money through this grant, school districts must meet the requirement of having at least 15% of children in poverty or a total of 6,500 poor children.[17]\\r\\nThe Targeted Assistance Grant formula allocates more money for each child as the poverty rate in a district increases.[17] This means that school districts with more poverty get more money for each poor child than districts with low poverty.[17]\\r\\nThe Education Finance Incentive Grant Formula has a two-pronged approach.[17] It is meant to reward schools that expend more state resources on public education and distribute funding in an equitable manner.[17] It is also meant to concentrate funds in districts with high poverty that inequitably distributes state and local education funding.[17] In states, funding is allocated to school districts in a way similar to the Targeted Assistance Grant formula but the weight of schools in districts with high poverty that inequitably distribute funding is doubled.[17]\\r\\nSince 2001, Federal Title I funding has increased by 88%. In dollars, this has been a $7.7 billion increase.[17] These funds were distributed through the Targeted Assistance and Education Finance Incentive Grant formulas, which target funds to disadvantaged students most directly.[17]\\r\\nTitle III of ESEA originally provided matching grants for supplementary education centers (Political Education, Cross 2004).\\r\\nTitle III was the innovations component of ESEA. It was, for its time, the greatest federal investment in education innovation ever.[18] Its best innovations, after validation, became part of the National Diffusion Network.\\r\\nThis section of the original ESEA provided for strengthening state departments of education (Political Education, Cross 2004). The original Title V was amended to state the purposes of education reform efforts between local and state educational systems. Title V states that the government should endorse and support local education reforms that parallel reforms occurring at the state level. Parts of this section also state that the government should support innovative programs that help to improve an educational system. This includes support programs for libraries, scientific research leading to state and local educational agencies to put promising reforms into place, as well as for programs to improve teacher performance.[8]\\r\\nTitle V also provides government grants given to educational institutions appropriating money to gifted programs for students, foreign language developers, as well as physical education, the arts, and overall mental health care of children and students.[8]\\r\\nAdded during the 1967 reauthorization of ESEA, Title VII introduced a program for bilingual education. It was championed by Texas Democrat Ralph Yarborough (Political Education, Cross 2004). It was originally created to aid Spanish-speaking students. However, in 1968 it transformed to the all-encompassing Bilingual Education Act (BEA). In its original form, the BEA was not explicit in mandating that all school districts provide bilingual education servicesit left much room for interpretation by districts. The ruling in Lau v. Nichols provided some clarityspecific program goals were established, support centers for bilingual education were created, and what a bilingual education program should look like was defined. The courts upheld the language of the BEA as it declared a bilingual education program as one providing English instruction in unison with the native language. The idea was to push students to high academic achievement via a program encouraging them to learn English while maintaining the native language.[19] \\"It proposed to cultivate in this child his ancestral pride, to reinforce (not destroy) the language he natively speaks, to cultivate his inherent strengths, to give him the sense of personal idenfitication so essential to social maturation,\\" summarizes Professor Cordasco of Montclair State College.[20]\\r\\nIn addition to programs for bilingual students, Title VII implemented plans to help Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Alaskan natives be provided opportunities for achieving academic equality.[8] In late 1967, Congress gave $7.5 million to school districts, scholars, and private research groups who proposed the best programs for improving bilingual education.[21] This section of the ESEA promotes the federal government working closely with local educational institutions to ensure that Indian, Hawaiian, and Alaskan students are being aided in getting the same educational experiences as all other students.[8] This is achieved through programs that keep cultural values intact and push students to strive for academic excellence.\\r\\nIt is worth noting that Title VII was replaced in the most recent reauthorization of the ESEA, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, and is now Title III Language Instruction for Limited English Proficient and Immigrant Students.\\r\\nIn 1980, President Jimmy Carter established the Department of Education which allowed for the Bilingual Education campaign to expand bilingual education programs.[22] In addition to Carters efforts, President Clinton also showed his support through the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994. The act dramatically increased funding for bilingual and immigrant education.[23] In 1998, the Linguistic Society of America showed its support for the BEA arguing that bilingual education was a basic human right; it believed that children should be educated in order to maintain their native language and cultural identity while acquiring the English language.[24]\\r\\nIn 2001 Texas authorized and encouraged school districts to adopt dual language immersion programs for elementary-aged students. It stipulated that instruction in each language should be split 50ÿ50 in class.[25] More recently The Civil Rights Project, a research center founded at Harvard University and located at UCLA since 2007 is calling on policymakers to develop a new vision for bilingual education. Gndara and Hopkins gather compelling evidence that shows English-only policies in the states that adopted these restrictions arent working[26] The project proposes a new attitude that embraces bilingualism: It is time that the U.S. join the rest of the developed world in viewing bilingualism as an asset, not a deficit, argues Gary Orfield, co-director of the project.[27]\\r\\nA 2014 bill, the Native Language Immersion Student Achievement Act, \\"cites reports from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and educational institutions 'that use primarily Native American languages to deliver education' and 'have indicated that students from these schools have generally had high school graduation and college attendance rates above the norm for their peers.'\\"[28]\\r\\nThe biggest obstacle to the BEA and expansion of bilingual education programs is the English-only Movement. There is no official language in the U.S., although some states have declared English as their official language. Three states in particular, California, Arizona, and Massachusetts, have declared English as their official language. In 1998, California passed Proposition 227 with the help of sponsor, Ron Unz, essentially ending bilingual education programs in exchange for an English immersion model which values assimilation over multiculturalism. In 2000, Arizona passed the English for Children initiative backed, again, by Ron Unz which mirrored Californias Proposition 227 in replacing bilingual education programs with English immersion ones.\\r\\nMany Americans question whether bilingual education programs or English immersion models are the best route to helping students acquire English. The question of whether public education should encourage the development of the native tongue or completely leave that up to the parent is a difficult one. Some point out that Californias Proposition 227 is failing the students for simply failing to address both the linguistic and cultural struggles that students face; in 2004, the test results for California public school students showed the achievement gap for English learners widening and the test scores of English learners to be declining across grade levels.[29] Scholar Stephen Krashen maintains that these three states who have taken the harshest anti-bilingual education policies have seen progress that is modest, at best.[30] In a report to the United States Government, an Arizona study shows that English language learners can take up to 13 years to attain fluencymost school programs only offer 3 years of participation in English-immersion or bilingual programs, putting the effectiveness of these programs into question.[31] In order to ease the worries and qualms that people had in the programs' effectiveness, the Obama Administration has recently proposed the implementation of an evaluation system that it would require states to use in order to judge the progress seen in English language learners in schools. This would potentially restore faith in the bilingual programs and hold schools more accountable to student achievement and progress. The question remains if states are properly equipped across the board to meet such high expectations.[32]","input":"When was the elementary and secondary education act created?"},{"output":"1999ÿ2000","context":"The Millennium celebrations were a worldwide, coordinated series of events celebrating New Year's Eve in 1999ÿ2000, marking the end of the second millennium and beginning of the new, third millennium.[1] This also marks the ending of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century.

Samuel Gompers of the Cigar Makers' International Union was elected president at its founding convention and reelected every year, except one, until his death in 1924. The AFL was the largest union grouping in the United States for the first half of the 20th century, even after the creation of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) by unions which were expelled by the AFL in 1935 over its opposition to industrial unionism. The Federation was founded and dominated by craft unions throughout its first fifty years, after which many craft union affiliates turned to organizing on an industrial union basis to meet the challenge from the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in the 1940s.\\r\\nIn 1955, the AFL merged with the CIO to create the AFL-CIO, which has comprised the longest lasting and most influential labor federation in the United States to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Federation of Labor (AFL) organized as an association of trade unions in 1886. The organization emerged from a dispute with the Knights of Labor (K of L) organization, in which the leadership of that organization solicited locals of various craft unions to withdraw from their International organizations and to affiliate with the K of L directly, an action which would have taken funds from the various unions and enriched the K of L's coffers.[1] The Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions also merged into what would become the American Federation of Labor.\\r\\nOne of the organizations embroiled in this controversy was the Cigar Makers' International Union (CMIU), a group subject to competition from a dual union, a rival \\"Progressive Cigarmakers' Union,\\" organized by members suspended or expelled by the CMIU.[2] The two cigar unions competed with one another in signing contracts with various cigar manufacturers, who were at this same time combining themselves into manufacturers' associations of their own in New York City, Detroit, Cincinnati, Chicago, and Milwaukee.[2]\\r\\nIn January 1886, the Cigar Manufacturers' Association of New York City attempted to flex its muscle by announcing a 20 percent wage cut in factories around the city. The Cigar Makers' International Union refused to accept the cut and 6,000 of its members in 19 factories were locked out by the owners. A strike lasting four weeks ensued.[3] Just when it appeared that the strike might be won, the New York District Assembly of the Knights of Labor leaped into the breach, offering to settle with the 19 factories at a lower wage scale than that proposed by the CMIU, so long as only the Progressive Cigarmakers' Union was employed.[3]\\r\\nThe leadership of the CMIU was enraged and demanded that the New York District Assembly be investigated and punished by the national officials of the Knights of Labor. The committee of investigation was controlled by individuals friendly to the New York District Assembly, however, and the latter was exonerated.[4] The American Federation of Labor was thus originally formed as an alliance of craft unions outside the Knights of Labor as a means of defending themselves against this and similar incursions.[5]\\r\\nOn April 25, 1886, a circular letter was issued by Strasser of the Cigar Makers and P. J. McGuire of the Carpenters, addressed to all national trade unions and calling for their attendance of a conference in Philadelphia on May 18.[6] The call stated that an element of the Knights of Labor was doing \\"malicious work\\" and causing \\"incalculable mischief by arousing antagonisms and dissensions in the labor movement.\\"[5] The call was signed by Strasser and McGuire, along with representatives of the Granite Cutters, the Iron Molders, and the secretary of the Federation of Trades of North America, a forerunner of the AFL founded in 1881.[5]\\r\\nForty-three invitations were mailed, which drew the attendance of 20 delegates and letters of approval from 12 other unions.[7] At this preliminary gathering, held in Donaldson Hall on the corner of Broad and Filbert Streets,[8] the K of L was charged with conspiring with anti-union bosses to provide labor at below going union rates and with making use of individuals who had crossed picket lines or defaulted on payment of union dues.[9] The body authored a \\"treaty\\" to be presented to the forthcoming May 24, 1886, convention of the Knights of Labor, which demanded that the K of L cease attempting to organize members of International Unions into its own assemblies without permission of the unions involved and that K of L organizers violating this provision should suffer immediate suspension.[9]\\r\\nFor its part, the Knights of Labor considered the demand for the parcelling of the labor movement into narrow craft-based fiefdoms to be anathema, a violation of the principle of solidarity of all workers across craft lines.[10] Negotiations with the dissident craft unions were nipped in the bud by the governing General Assembly of the K of L, however, with the organization's Grand Master Workman, Terence V. Powderly refusing to enter into serious discussions on the matter.[11] The actions of the New York District Assembly of the K of L were upheld.\\r\\nConvinced that no accommodation with the leadership of the Knights of Labor was possible, the heads of the five labor organizations which issued the call for the April 1886 conference issued a new call for a convention to be held December 8, 1886 in Columbus, Ohio in order to construct \\"an American federation of alliance of all national and international trade unions.\\"[12] Forty-two delegates representing 13 national unions and various other local labor organizations responded to the call, agreeing to form themselves into an American Federation of Labor.[13]\\r\\nRevenue for the new organization was to be raised on the basis of a \\"per-capita tax\\" of its member organizations, set at the rate of one-half cent per member per month (i.e. six cents per year).[14] Governance of the organization was to be by annual conventions, with one delegate allocated for every 4,000 members of each affiliated union.[14] The founding convention voted to make the President of the new federation a full-time official at a salary of $1,000 per year, and Samuel Gompers of the Cigar Makers' International Union was elected to the position.[14] Gompers would ultimately be re-elected to the position by annual conventions of the organization for every year save one until his death nearly four decades later.\\r\\nAlthough the founding convention of the AFL had authorized the establishment of a publication for the new organization, Gompers made use of the existing labor press to generate support for the position of the craft unions against the Knights of Labor. Powerful opinion-makers of the American labor movement such as the Philadelphia Tocsin, Haverhill Labor, the Brooklyn Labor Press, and the Denver Labor Enquirer granted Gompers space in their pages, in which he made the case for the unions against the attacks of employers, \\"all too often aided by the K of L.\\"[15]\\r\\nHeadway was made in the form of endorsement by various local labor bodies. Some assemblies of the K of L supported the Cigar Makers' position and departed the organization: in Baltimore, 30 locals left the organization, while the membership of the Knights in Chicago fell from 25,000 in 1886 to just 3,500 in 1887.[16] Factional warfare broke out in the K of L, with Terence Powderly blaming the organization's travails on \\"radicals\\" in its ranks, while those opposing Powderly called for an end to what they perceived as \\"autocratic leadership.\\"[17]\\r\\nIn the face of the steady disintegration of its rival, the fledgling American Federation of Labor struggled to maintain itself, with the group showing very slow and incremental growth in its first years, only cracking the 250,000 member mark in 1892.[18] The group from the outset concentrated upon the income and working conditions of its membership as its almost sole focus. The AFL's founding convention declaring \\"higher wages and a shorter workday\\" to be \\"preliminary steps toward great and accompanying improvements in the condition of the working people.\\" Participation in partisan politics was avoided as inherently divisive, and the group's constitution was structured to prevent the admission of political parties as affiliates.[19]\\r\\nThis fundamentally conservative \\"pure and simple\\" approach limited the AFL to matters pertaining to working conditions and rates of pay, relegating political goals to its allies in the political sphere. The Federation favored pursuit of workers' immediate demands rather than challenging the property rights of owners, and took a pragmatic view of politics which favored tactical support for particular politicians over formation of a party devoted to workers' interests. The AFL's leadership believed the expansion of the capitalist system was seen as the path to betterment of labor, an orientation making it possible for the AFL to present itself as what one historian has called \\"the conservative alternative to working class radicalism.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe AFL faced its first major reversal when employers launched an open shop movement in 1903 designed to drive unions out of construction, mining, longshore and other industries. Membership in the AFL's affiliated unions declined between 1904 and 1914 in the face of this concerted anti-union drive, which made effective use of legal injunctions against strikes, court rulings given force when backed with the armed might of the state.[citation needed] At its November 1907 Convention in Norfolk, Virginia the AFL founded the future North America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU) as Department of Building Trades.[21]:1\\r\\nEver the pragmatist, Gompers argued that labor should \\"reward its friends and punish its enemies\\" in both major parties. However, in the 1900s (decade), the two parties began to realign, with the main faction of the Republican Party coming to identify with the interests of banks and manufacturers, while a substantial portion of the rival Democratic Party took a more labor-friendly position. While not precluding its members from belonging to the Socialist Party or working with its members, the AFL traditionally refused to pursue the tactic of independent political action by the workers in the form of the existing Socialist Party or the establishment of a new labor party. After 1908, the organization's tie to the Democratic party grew increasingly strong.[22]\\r\\nSome unions within the AFL helped form and participated in the National Civic Federation. The National Civic Federation was formed by several progressive employers who sought to avoid labor disputes by fostering collective bargaining and \\"responsible\\" unionism. Labor's participation in this federation, at first tentative, created internal division within the AFL. Socialists, who believed the only way to help workers was to remove large industry from private ownership, denounced labor's efforts at cooperation with the capitalists in the National Civic Federation. The AFL nonetheless continued its association with the group, which declined in importance as the decade of the 1910s drew to a close.[23]\\r\\nBy the 1890s, Gompers was planning an international federation of labor, starting with the expansion of AFL affiliates in Canada, especially Ontario. He helped the Canadian Trades and Labour Congress with money and organizers, and by 1902, the AFL came to dominate the Canadian union movement.[24]\\r\\nThe AFL vigorously opposed unrestricted immigration from Europe for moral, cultural, and racial reasons. The issue unified the workers who feared that an influx of new workers would flood the labor market and lower wages.[25] Nativism was not a factor because upwards of half the union members were themselves immigrants or the sons of immigrants from Ireland, Germany and Britain. Nativism was a factor when the AFL even more strenuously opposed all immigration from Asia because it represented (to its Euro-American members) an alien culture that could not be assimilated into American society. The AFL intensified its opposition after 1906 and was instrumental in passing immigration restriction bills from the 1890s to the 1920s, such as the 1921 Emergency Quota Act and the Immigration Act of 1924, and seeing that they were strictly enforced.[26]\\r\\nMink (1986) concludes that the link between the AFL and the Democratic Party rested in part on immigration issues, noting the large corporations, which supported the Republicans, wanted more immigration to augment their labor force.[27]\\r\\nTowards the beginning of World War I, the AFL was against prohibition as it was viewed as cultural right of the working class to drink.[28]\\r\\nDuring World War I, the AFLmotivated by fear of government repression, and hope of aid (often in the form of pro-AFL labor policies)had worked out an informal agreement with the United States government, in which the AFL would coordinate with the government both to support the war effort and to join \\"into an alliance to crush radical labor groups\\" such as the Industrial Workers of the World and Socialist Party of America.[29]\\r\\nIn the pro-business environment of the 1920s, business launched a large-scale offensive on behalf of the so-called \\"open shop\\", which meant that a person did not have to be a union member to be hired. AFL unions lost membership steadily until 1933.[30] In 1924, following the death of Samuel Gompers, UMWA member and AFL vice president William Green became the president of the labor federation.[31]\\r\\nThe organization endorsed pro-labor progressive Robert M. La Follette Sr. in the 1924 presidential election. He only carried his home state of Wisconsin. The campaign failed to establish a permanent independent party closely connected to the labor movement, however, and thereafter the Federation embraced ever more closely the Democratic Party, despite the fact that many union leaders remained Republicans.[32] Herbert Hoover in 1928 won the votes of many Protestant AFL members.[33]\\r\\nThe Great Depression were hard times for the unions, and membership fell sharply across the country. As the national economy began to recover in 1933, so did union membership. The New Deal of president Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, strongly favored labor unions. He made sure that relief operations like the Civilian Conservation Corps did not include a training component that would produce skilled workers who would compete with union members in a still glutted market. The major legislation was the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, called the Wagner Act. It greatly strengthened organized unions, especially by weakening the company unions that many workers belonged to. It was to the members advantage to transform a company union into a local of an AFL union, and thousands did so, dramatically boosting the membership. The Wagner Act also set up to the National Labor Relations Board, which used its powers to rule in favor of unions and against the companies. However, the NLRB was later taken over by leftist elements who favored the CIO over the AFL.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the early 1930s AFL president William Green (president, 1924ÿ1952) experimented with an industrial approach to organizing in the automobile and steel industries.[34] The AFL made forays into industrial unionism by chartering federal labor unions, which would organize across an industry and be chartered by the Federation, not through existing craft unions, guilds, or brotherhoods. As early as 1923, the AFL had chartered federal labor unions, including six news writer locals that had formerly been part of the International Typographical Union.[35] However, in the 1930s the AFL began chartering these federal labor unions as an industrial organizing strategy. The dues in these federal labor unions (FLUs) were kept intentionally low to make them more accessible to low paid industrial workers; however, these low dues later allowed the Internationals in the Federation to deny members of FLUs voting membership at conventions.[36] In 1933, Green sent William Collins to Detroit to organize automobile workers into a federal labor union.[34] That same year workers at the Westinghouse plant in East Springfield MA, members of federal labor union 18476, struck for recognition.[37] In 1933, the AFL received 1,205 applications for charters for federal labor unions, 1006 of which were granted.[38] By 1934, the AFL had successfully organized 32,500 autoworkers using the federal labor union model.[39] Most of the leadership of the craft union internationals that made up the federation, advocated for the FLU's to be absorbed into existing craft union internationals and for these internationals to have supremacy of jurisdiction.[39][38] At the 1933 AFL convention in Washington, DC John Frey of the Molders and Metal Trades pushed for craft union internationals to have jurisdictional supremacy over the FLU's; the Carpenters headed by William Hutchenson and the IBEW also pushed for FLU's to turn over their members to the authority of the craft internationals between 1933 and 1935.[40] In 1934, one hundred FLUs met separately and demanded that the AFL continue to issue charters to unions organizing on an industrial basis independent of the existing craft union internationals.[41] In 1935 the FLUs representing autoworkers and rubber workers both held conventions independent of the craft union internationals.[42] By the 1935 AFL convention, Green and the advocates of traditional craft unionism faced increasing dissension led by John L. Lewis of the coal miners, Sidney Hillman of the Amalgamated, David Dubinsky of the Garment Workers, Charles Howard of the ITU, Thomas McMahon of the Textile Workers, and Max Zaritsky of the Hat, Cap, and Millinery Workers, in addition to the members of the FLU's themselves.[43] Lewis argued that the AFL was too heavily oriented toward traditional craftsmen, and was overlooking the opportunity to organize millions of semiskilled workers, especially those in industrial factories that made automobiles, rubber, glass and steel. In 1935 Lewis led the dissenting unions in forming a new Congress for Industrial Organization (CIO) within the AFL. Both the new CIO industrial unions, and the older AFL crafts unions grew rapidly after 1935. In 1936 union members enthusiastically supported Roosevelt's landslide reelection. Proposals for the creation of an independent labor party were rejected.[44]\\r\\nThe AFL retained close ties to the Democratic machines in big cities through the 1940s. Its membership surged during the war and it held on to most of its new members after wartime legal support for labor was removed. Despite its close connections to many in Congress, the AFL was not able to block the TaftÿHartley Act in 1947.[45]\\r\\nIn 1955, the AFL and CIO merged to form the AFLÿCIO, headed by George Meany.[46]\\r\\nDuring its first years, the AFL admitted nearly anyone. Gompers opened the AFL to radical and socialist workers and to some semiskilled and unskilled workers. Women, African Americans, and immigrants joined in small numbers. But by the 1890s, the Federation had begun to organize only skilled workers in craft unions and became an organization of mostly white men. Although the Federation preached a policy of egalitarianism in regard to African American workers, it actively discriminated against black workers.[47][48] The AFL sanctioned the maintenance of segregated locals within its affiliatesparticularly in the construction and railroad industriesa practice which often excluded black workers altogether from union membership and thus from employment in organized industries.[49]\\r\\nIn 1901, the AFL lobbied Congress to reauthorize the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, and issued a pamphlet entitled \\"Some reasons for Chinese exclusion. Which shall survive?\\" The AFL also began one of the first organized labor boycotts when they began putting white stickers on the cigars made by unionized white cigar rollers while simultaneously discouraging consumers from purchasing cigars rolled by Chinese workers.[50]\\r\\nIn most ways, the AFL's treatment of women workers paralleled its policy towards black workers. The AFL never adopted a strict policy of gender exclusion and, at times, even came out in favor of women's unionism. But despite such rhetoric, the Federation only half-heartedly supported women's attempts to organize and, more often, took pains to keep women out of unions and the workforce altogether. Only two national unions affiliated with the AFL at its founding openly included women, and others passed by-laws barring women's membership entirely. The AFL hired its first female organizer, Mary Kenney O'Sullivan, only in 1892, released her after five months, and it did not replace her or hire another woman national organizer until 1908. Women who organized their own unions were often turned down in bids to join the Federation, and even women who did join unions found them hostile or intentionally inaccessible. AFL unions often held meetings at night or in bars when women might find it difficult to attend and where they might feel uncomfortable, and male unionists heckled women who tried to speak at meetings.[51]\\r\\nGenerally the AFL viewed women workers as competition, as strikebreakers, or as an unskilled labor reserve that kept wages low. As such, the Federation often opposed women's employment entirely. When it did organize women workers, most often it did so to protect men's jobs and earning power and not to improve the conditions, lives, or wages of women workers. In response, most women workers remained outside the labor movement. In 1900, only 3.3% of working women were organized into unions. In 1910, even as the AFL surged forward in membership, the number had dipped to 1.5%. And while it improved to 6.6% over the next decade, women remained mostly outside of unions and practically invisible inside of them into the mid-1920s.[52]\\r\\nAttitudes gradually changed within the AFL due to the pressure of organized female workers. Female-domination began to emerge in the first two decades of the 20th century, including particularly the International Ladies Garment Workers' Union. Women organized independent locals among New York hat makers, in the Chicago stockyards, and among Jewish and Italian waist makers, to name only three examples. Through the efforts of middle class reformers and activists, often of the Women's Trade Union League, these unions joined the AFL.[53]\\r\\nFrom the beginning, unions affiliated with the AFL found themselves in conflict when both unions claimed jurisdiction over the same groups of workers: both the Brewers and Teamsters claimed to represent beer truck drivers, both the Machinists and the International Typographical Union claimed to represent certain printroom employees, and the Machinists and a fledgling union known as the \\"Carriage, Wagon and Automobile Workers Union\\" sought to organize the same employeeseven though neither union had made any effort to organize or bargain for those employees. In some cases the AFL mediated the dispute, usually favoring the larger or more influential union. The AFL often reversed its jurisdictional rulings over time, as the continuing jurisdictional battles between the Brewers and the Teamsters showed. In other cases the AFL expelled the offending union, as it did in 1913 in the case of the Carriage, Wagon and Automobile Workers Union (which quickly disappeared).[citation needed]\\r\\nThese jurisdictional disputes were most frequent in the building trades, where a number of different unions might claim the right to have work assigned to their members. The craft unions in this industry organized their own department within the AFL in 1908, despite the reservations of Gompers and other leaders about creation of a separate body within the AFL that might function as a federation within a federation. While those fears were partly borne out in practice, as the Building Trades Department did acquire a great deal of practical power gained through resolving jurisdictional disputes between affiliates, the danger that it might serve as the basis for schism never materialized.[citation needed]\\r\\nAffiliates within the AFL formed \\"departments\\" to help resolve these jurisdictional conflicts and to provide a more effective voice for member unions in given industries. The Metal Trades Department engaged in some organizing of its own, primarily in shipbuilding, where unions such as the Pipefitters, Machinists and Iron Workers joined together through local metal workers' councils to represent a diverse group of workers. The Railway Employees Department dealt with both jurisdictional disputes between affiliates and pursued a common legislative agenda for all of them. Even that sort of structure did not prevent AFL unions from finding themselves in conflict on political issues. For example, the International Seamen's Union opposed passage of a law applying to workers engaged in interstate transport that railway unions supported. The AFL bridged these differences on an ad hoc basis.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe AFL made efforts in its early years to assist its affiliates in organizing: it advanced funds or provided organizers or, in some cases, such as the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Teamsters and the American Federation of Musicians, helped form the union. The AFL also used its influence (including refusal of charters or expulsion) to heal splits within affiliated unions, to force separate unions seeking to represent the same or closely related jurisdictions to merge, or to mediate disputes between rival factions where both sides claimed to represent the leadership of an affiliated union. The AFL also chartered \\"federal unions\\"local unions not affiliated with any international unionin those fields in which no affiliate claimed jurisdiction.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe AFL also encouraged the formation of local labor bodies (known as central labor councils) in major metropolitan areas in which all of the affiliates could participate. These local labor councils acquired a great deal of influence in some cases. For example, the Chicago Federation of Labor spearheaded efforts to organize packinghouse and steel workers during and immediately after World War I. Local building trades councils also became powerful in some areas. In San Francisco, the local Building Trades Council, led by Carpenters official P. H. McCarthy, not only dominated the local labor council but helped elect McCarthy mayor of San Francisco in 1909. In a very few cases early in the AFL's history, state and local bodies defied AFL policy or chose to disaffiliate over policy disputes.[citation needed]\\r\\nThough Gompers had contact with socialists and such as AFL co-founder Peter J. McGuire, the AFL adopted a philosophy of \\"business unionism\\" that emphasized unions' contribution to businesses' profits and national economic growth. The business unionist approach also focused on skilled workers' immediate job-related interests, while refusing to \\"rush to the support of any one of the numerous society-saving or society destroying schemes\\" involved in larger political issues.[54] This approach was set by Gompers, who was influenced by a fellow cigar maker (and former socialist) Ferdinand Laurrel. Despite his socialist contacts, Gompers himself was not a socialist.[55]\\r\\nIn some respects the AFL leadership took a pragmatic view toward politicians, following Gompers' slogan to \\"reward your friends and punish your enemies\\" without regard to party affiliation. Over time, after repeated disappointments with the failure of labor's legislative efforts to protect workers' rights, which the courts had struck down as unconstitutional, Gompers became almost anti-political, opposing some forms of protective legislation, such as limitations on working hours, because they would detract from the efforts of unions to obtain those same benefits through collective bargaining.[citation needed]\\r\\nEmployers discovered the efficacy of labor injunctions, first used with great effect by the Cleveland administration during the Pullman Strike in 1894. While the AFL sought to outlaw \\"yellow dog contracts,\\" to limit the courts' power to impose \\"government by injunction\\" and to obtain exemption from the antitrust laws that were being used to criminalize labor organizing, the courts reversed what few legislative successes the labor movement won.[56]\\r\\nThe AFL concentrated its political efforts during the last decades of the Gompers administration on securing freedom from state control of unionsin particular an end to the court's use of labor injunctions to block the right to organize or strike and the application of the anti-trust laws to criminalize labor's use of pickets, boycotts and strikes. The AFL thought that it had achieved the latter with the passage of the Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914which Gompers referred to as \\"Labor's Magna Carta\\". But in Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U.S. 443 (1921), the United States Supreme Court narrowly read the Act and codified the federal courts' existing power to issue injunctions rather than limit it. The court read the phrase \\"between an employer and employees\\" (contained in the first paragraph of the Act) to refer only to cases involving an employer and its own employees, leaving the courts free to punish unions for engaging in sympathy strikes or secondary boycotts.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe AFL's pessimistic attitude towards politics did not, on the other hand, prevent affiliated unions from pursuing their own agendas. Construction unions supported legislation that governed entry of contractors into the industry and protected workers' rights to pay, rail and mass production industries sought workplace safety legislation, and unions generally agitated for the passage of workers' compensation statutes.[citation needed]\\r\\nAt the same time, the AFL took efforts on behalf of women in supporting protective legislation. It advocated fewer hours for women workers, and based its arguments on assumptions of female weakness. Like efforts to unionize, most support for protective legislation for women came out of a desire to protect men's jobs. If women's hours could be limited, reasoned AFL officials, they would infringe less on male employment and earning potential. But the AFL also took more selfless efforts. Even from the 1890s, the AFL declared itself vigorously in favor of women's suffrage. It often printed pro-suffrage articles in its periodical, and in 1918, it supported the National Union of Women's Suffrage.[57]\\r\\nThe AFL relaxed its rigid stand against legislation after the death of Gompers. Even so, it remained cautious. Its proposals for unemployment benefits (made in the late 1920s) were too modest to have practical value, as the Great Depression soon showed. The impetus for the major federal labor laws of the 1930s came from the New Deal. The enormous growth in union membership came after Congress passed the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933 and National Labor Relations Act in 1935. The AFL refused to sanction or participate in the mass strikes led by John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers and other left unions such as the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. After the AFL expelled the CIO in 1936, the CIO undertook a major organizing effort. The AFL responded with its own massive organizing drive that kept its membership totals 50 percent higher than the CIO's.[citation needed]","input":"When did the american federation of labor start?"},{"output":"December 11, 1997","context":"Baseball:\\r\\n1,500 standing-room capacity\\r\\nNCAA Football:\\r\\nSoccer:\\r\\nAT&T Park is a baseball park located in the South Beach neighborhood of San Francisco, California. Since 2000, it has served as the home of the San Francisco Giants, the city's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. Originally named Pacific Bell Park, then SBC Park in 2003 after SBC Communications acquired Pacific Bell, the stadium was ultimately christened AT&T Park in 2006, following SBC's buyout of AT&T. The park stands along the San Francisco Bay, a segment of which is named McCovey Cove in honor of former Giants player Willie McCovey.\\r\\nAT&T Park has also played host to both professional and collegiate American football games. The stadium was the home of the Foster Farms Bowl, an annual college postseason bowl game, from its inaugural playing in 2002 until 2013 and also served as the temporary home for the University of California's football team in 2011. Professionally, AT&T Park was the home of the San Francisco Demons of the XFL and the California Redwoods of the United Football League.\\r\\nThe stadium will host the Rugby World Cup Sevens 2018 [9]\\r\\nThe stadium can be reached via San Francisco's Muni Metro; the 2nd and King Station is directly outside the ballpark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally designed to be a 42,000-seat stadium, there were slight modifications before the final design was complete. When the ballpark was brought to the ballot box in the fall of 1996 for voter approval, the stadium was 15 clockwise from its current position. Also the center-field scoreboard was atop the right-field wall and the Giants Pavilion Building were two separate buildings.[10] Groundbreaking on the ballpark began on December 11, 1997, in the industrial waterfront area of San Francisco known as China Basin in the up-and-coming neighborhoods of South Beach and Mission Bay. The stadium cost $357 million to build and supplanted the Giants' former home, Candlestick Park, a multi-use stadium in southeastern San Francisco that was also home to the National Football League's San Francisco 49ers until 2014, when they too relocated to Levi's Stadium in nearby Santa Clara. A team of engineers from UC Davis was consulted in the design process of the park, resulting in wind levels that are approximately half those at Candlestick. Fans had shivered through 40 seasons at \\"The 'Stick\\" and looked forward to warmer temperatures at the new ballpark.[11] But because AT&T Park, like its predecessor, is built right on San Francisco Bay, cold summer fog and winter jackets in July are still not unusual at Giants games, despite the higher average temperature.\\r\\nWhen it opened on March 31, 2000, the ballpark was the first Major League ballpark built without public funds since the completion of Dodger Stadium in 1962.[12] However, the Giants did receive a $10?million tax abatement from the city and $80?million for upgrades to the local infrastructure (including a connection to the Muni Metro).[13] The Giants have a 66-year lease on the 12.5-acre (51,000?m2) ballpark site, paying $1.2?million in rent annually to the San Francisco Port Commission.[12] The park opened with a seating capacity of 40,800, but this has increased over time as seats have been added.\\r\\nIn April 2010, the stadium became the first MLB ballpark to receive LEED Silver Certification for Existing Buildings, Operations and Maintenance.[14]\\r\\nThe Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company, a local telephone company in the San Francisco Bay Area, purchased the naming rights for the park for $50?million over 24?years in the Winter of 1996.[15] Pacific Bell had been recently purchased by SBC Communications when the naming rights deal was agreed upon. SBC eventually dropped the Pacific Bell name and reached an agreement with the Giants to change the stadium's name to \\"SBC Park\\" on January 1, 2004.[15]\\r\\nAfter SBC bought AT&T Corporation on November 18, 2005, the name of the merged company became AT&T Inc. As a result, the stadium was given its third name in six years: \\"AT&T Park\\".[15] A few fans still refer to the stadium as \\"Pac Bell Park\\", as it was the first name given to the stadium. Others have named the stadium \\"The Phone Booth\\" or \\"Telephone Park\\", for the constant name changes, while some referred to the stadium as \\"Some Big Corporation Park\\" due to the SBC years. Some referred to it as the ballpark to be named later. Others yet refer to it as \\"Mays Field\\" in honor of Giants great Willie Mays or simply \\"The Bell\\".[16] Many also refer to the stadium as \\"China Basin\\" or \\"McCovey Cove\\" after its location, which would be immune to changes in sponsorship naming.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe stadium contains 68 luxury suites, 5,200 club seats on the club level, and an additional 1,500 club seats at the field level behind home plate.\\r\\nOn the facing of the upper deck along the left-field line are the retired numbers of Bill Terry, Mel Ott, Carl Hubbell, Monte Irvin, Willie Mays, Juan Marichal, Orlando Cepeda, Jackie Robinson, Willie McCovey, and Gaylord Perry, as well as the retired uniforms, denoted \\"NY\\", of Christy Mathewson and John McGraw who played or managed in the pre-number era. These two pre-numberÿera retired uniforms are among only six such retired uniforms in all of the Major Leagues.\\r\\nAT&T Park has a reputation of being a pitcher's park and the most pitcher-friendly ballpark in the National League, because the depth of the outfield limits home runs, according to ESPN.[17]\\r\\nIn 2014, PETA declared the park to be the Most Vegetarian-Friendly MLB ballpark in the country. It held the top spot on the same list in 2011, 2006 and 2005.[18]\\r\\nThe most prominent feature of the ballpark is the right-field wall, which is 24 feet (7.3?m) high in honor of former Giant Willie Mays, who wore number 24. Because of the proximity to the San Francisco Bay, the right-field foul pole is only 309 feet (94?m) from home plate. The wall is made of brick, with fenced-off archways opening to the Cove beyond, above which are several rows of arcade seating. The fence angles quickly away from home plate; right-center field extends out to 421 feet (128?m) from home plate. Atop the fence are four pillars with fountains atop. Jets of water burst from the four pillars at the end of the National Anthem and also when the Giants hit a home run or win a game.\\r\\nIn the past, rubber chickens put up by fans whenever a Giants player (especially Barry Bonds) was intentionally walked, would line the foul portion of the wall. The fans would do this to show that the opposing team is \\"chicken\\" for not pitching right to the Giants players. In recent seasons, as the team's strength has shifted from hitting to pitching, fans will line up \\"K\\" signs with each strikeout by a Giants pitcher. To some seniors, the right field area vaguely suggests the layout at the Polo Grounds. This deep corner of the ballpark has been dubbed \\"Death Valley\\" and \\"Triples' Alley.\\" Like its Polo Grounds counterpart, it is very difficult to hit a home run to this area, and a batted ball that finds its way into this corner often results in a triple. Triples' Alley is also infamous for bad bounces, most notably when Ichiro Suzuki hit the first-ever inside-the-park home run in an All-Star Game by lining the ball off one of the archways and sideways past the outfielders. Nate Schierholtz performed the same feat in the 2009 season as a pinch hitter. Aubrey Huff did it again in the 2010 season, as did Conor Gillaspie in 2011. ngel Pagn ended a game in May 2013 with a two-run walk-off inside-the-park home run, the first of its kind at AT&T Park.\\r\\nBeyond right field is China Basin, a section of San Francisco Bay, which is dubbed McCovey Cove after famed Giants first baseman and left-handed slugger Willie McCovey, and into which a number of home runs have been hit on the fly. As of August 21 2017, 75 \\"splash hits\\" have been knocked into the Cove by Giants players since the park opened; 35 of those were by Barry Bonds, and the most recent being Denard Span hitting one off Carlos Carrasco of the Cleveland Indians on July 19, 2017. These hits are tallied on an electronic counter on the right field wall. Opponents have hit the water on the fly 42 times; Todd Hundley of the Los Angeles Dodgers was the first visitor to do so on June 30, 2000. Curtis Granderson of the New York Mets, Luis Gonzalez of the Arizona Diamondbacks and Cliff Floyd of the Chicago Cubs are the only visiting players to do so twice, while Carlos Delgado of the New York Mets has performed the feat three times. Adam LaRoche has also hit three splash hits, twice with the Arizona Diamondbacks and once with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Curtis Granderson of the New York Mets most recently hit one into the water as a visiting player on August 19, 2016 On June 27, 2010, David Ortiz of the Boston Red Sox became the first American League player to hit a splash hit. The only other AL players who have done it are Mitch Moreland of the Texas Rangers on June 9, 2012 and Adam Dunn of the Chicago White Sox on August 13, 2014. Barry Bonds is the Giant who has hit the most home runs into \\"The Cove\\" as Giants fans call it and is the only one to have had hit 2 splash hits in one game (a feat he accomplished twice).[19]\\r\\nBehind the scoreboard in center field there is a pier where ferries can tie up and let off fans right at the park. On game days, fans take to the water of McCovey Cove in boats and even in kayaks, often with fishing nets in the hope of collecting a home run ball. (This echoes what used to happen during McCovey's playing days. Before Candlestick Park's upper deck was extended, the area behind right field was occupied by three small bleacher sections and a lot of open space. Kids in those bleachers would gather behind the right field fence when \\"Stretch\\" would come to the plate.) Just beyond the wall is a public waterfront promenade, where fans can watch three innings of a game through the wall's archways, free of charge, albeit with a somewhat obstructed view. Across the cove from the ballpark is McCovey Point and China Basin Park, featuring monuments to past Giants legends.\\r\\nWhen the park opened in 2000, taking residence on the right field wall was Rusty, the Mechanical Man based on a theme of Old Navy since the wall was sponsored by the company. Rusty was a two-dimensional robotic ballplayer that stood 14 feet (4.3?m) tall and weighed 5? tons. The Valencia, California firm, Technifex, engineered, fabricated and programmed Rusty to appear after major plays, during games, as a fully animated giant 1920's era tin \\"toy\\". After technical problems arose with Rusty, it was removed from the Old Navy Splash Landing, though the enclosure that housed him remained for years. In 2006 the Old Navy sponsorship of the wall was terminated and renamed \\"Levi's Landing\\". In 2008, the enclosure was removed as that area near the right field foul pole was renovated for a new luxury party suite called the \\"McCovey Cove Loft\\".[20]\\r\\nBehind the left field bleachers is \\"The Coca-Cola Fan Lot\\". The ballpark features an 80-foot (24?m) long Coca-Cola bottle with playground slides that lights up with every Giants home run, and a miniature version of the stadium. \\"The Coca-Cola Superslide\\" is popular with children as is with adults, and the terraced levels of the slides are a fun way to catch the game. Bubbles originally accompanied the bottle, but never worked as intended and were removed. If one were viewing the outfield promenade from home plate, directly to the bottle's right is another oversized representation of a ballpark stalwart, the \\"Giant 1927 Old-Time Four-Fingered Baseball Glove\\"  this particular one is made of steel and fiberglass. Behind and farther to the left is \\"The Little Giants Park\\" ÿ a miniature baseball diamond  sort of a minor league tryout for Pee-Wee Ball.[21]\\r\\nTo the right of the glove sculpture is the elevator and large plaza area for functions and parties to be held during games. It's also the site of \\"Orlando's\\", the concessions stand of Giants great Orlando Cepeda. The signature fare at the stand is the \\"Caribbean Cha Cha Bowl\\". Right-center field features a real San Francisco cable car (retired cable car #4, formerly #504), with a label that states \\"No Dodgers Fans Allowed\\". The fog horn  a feature introduced at Candlestick Park by the current Giants ownership group ÿ was transferred to AT&T and hung underneath the scoreboard. It blows when a Giants player hits a home run or at the conclusion of a Giants win. Continuing right takes one to the promenade above the Cove, so that one can make a completely uninterrupted circuit of the park at that concourse level. Both levels of the concourse, inside the stadium, feature not only concession stands of all sorts, but other attractions as well.\\r\\nLocated behind the centerfield bleachers, the ballpark features the @Caf,[22] a social media caf, which opened in the 2013 season. The cafe serves Peet's Coffee and features large screens that show off fans' social media posts from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, which are curated by the Giants organization.\\r\\nThe cafe replaced a team-themed Build-A-Bear Workshop store, where fans could build their own stuffed Giants' mascot, Lou Seal, or create other Giants-themed stuffed animals.\\r\\nIn addition to the automated scoreboards, which now include a new high-definition video board by Mitsubishi, the park has enormous, manually operated boards on the right field wall, which display the scores of Major League games played elsewhere. These manual scoreboards are operated by three employees, whose work on game days starts at least two hours before the first pitch.\\r\\nStarting in 2004, the Giants installed 122 wireless internet access points, covering all concourses and seating areas, creating one of the largest public hotspots in the world[23] at the time.\\r\\nOn September 23, 2008, the Giants Wall of Fame was unveiled on the King Street side of the ballpark,[24] as part of the 50th-anniversary celebration of the Giants' move to San Francisco. Forty-three retired players were inducted, based on longevity and achievement.[25] Eligibility requirements for players to be on the Wall are either five years as a San Francisco Giant with an All-Star Game appearance or nine years as a Giant.[26] Rich Aurilia and Shawn Estes were added in 2010.[27] Jason Schmidt and Marvin Benard were added in 2011.\\r\\nOutside the ballpark are six statues, five of which are dedicated to San Francisco Giants all-time greats.\\r\\nThe Willie Mays Statue is located in front of the ballpark entrance at 24 Willie Mays Plaza and is surrounded with 24 palm trees, in honor of his number 24 uniform, retired by the Giants. It was dedicated at noon on March 31, 2000, prior to the opening of the ballpark and was commissioned by Giants Managing Partner Peter Magowan and his wife Debby.[29]\\r\\nAnother statue is located at McCovey Point across McCovey Cove, and is dedicated to Willie McCovey. Around the Willie McCovey Statue are a number of plaques that celebrate the winners of the Willie Mac Award. The statue is located at China Basin Park next to The Barry Bonds Junior Giants Field, a T-ball park. Also located on the sea wall promenade are plaques showing the Opening Day roster of every Giants team from 1958 through 1999. Giants fans who contributed funds to China Basin Park, had their own tiles with their own inscriptions set into the wall.[30]\\r\\nA third statue, dedicated in 2005, honors former Giants pitcher Juan Marichal, and is located outside the ballpark at the Lefty O'Doul Gate entrance. The fourth statue is located at the park's ferry plaza behind center field, also known as Seals Plaza; a statue of a seal bobbing a baseball on its nose honors the memory of the San Francisco Seals, the minor league baseball club that played before the arrival of the Giants in 1958.\\r\\nOn September 6, 2008, during a series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, a fifth statue depicting former Giants great Orlando Cepeda was dedicated at the corner of 2nd and King Streets next to the ballpark. A sixth statue, dedicated on August 13, 2016, honors former Giants pitcher Gaylord Perry and is also located at the corner of 2nd and King Streets next to the ballpark. All five statues of the Giants Hall of Fame players were created by sculptor William Behrends of North Carolina.\\r\\nThe opening series took place April 11ÿ13, 2000 against the Los Angeles Dodgers (the team the Giants faced in their final series at Candlestick Park), and the Giants were swept in three games. In the first game of that series, the Giants lost 6ÿ5, highlighted by three home runs from the Dodgers' Kevin Elster. On May 1, 2000, Barry Bonds became the first player to hit a \\"splash hit\\" home run into McCovey Cove.\\r\\nIn just its first few years of existence, the ballpark saw its share of historic events primarily due to veteran Giants outfielder Barry Bonds. On April 17, 2001, Bonds hit his 500th career home run at then-Pacific Bell Park. Later that year, he set the single season home run record when he hit home runs number 71, 72, and 73 over the weekend of October 5 to close the season. On August 9, 2002, Bonds hit his 600th career home run at the park. On April 12, 2004, Bonds hit career home run 660 at SBC Park to tie Willie Mays for third on the all-time list and on the next night, he hit number 661 to move into sole possession of third place. On September 17, 2004, Bonds hit his 700th career home run at the park to become just the third member of baseball's 700 club. On May 28, 2006, Bonds hit his 715th home run at the park to pass Babe Ruth for second place on the all-time list. On August 7, 2007, Bonds hit his 756th home run, breaking Hank Aaron's record.\\r\\nThe park hosted games three through five of the 2002 World Series against the Anaheim Angels, which the Giants lost four games to three. It also hosted the 2007 MLB All-Star Game, which the American League won 5ÿ4 over the National League.\\r\\nOn July 10, 2009, the Giants' Jonathan Snchez pitched the first no-hitter at AT&T Park.\\r\\nOn October 27 & 28, 2010, the Giants hosted the first two games of the World Series, beating the Texas Rangers in both games. They ultimately went on to win the series, their first championship since the team moved to San Francisco in 1958, though the clinching game was played at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington rather than at AT&T Park.\\r\\nOn June 13, 2012, Matt Cain threw the 22nd perfect game in MLB history  and first in Giants history  against the Houston Astros.\\r\\nAT&T Park hosted Games 1 and 2 of the 2012 World Series on October 24 and 25. The Giants beat the Detroit Tigers twice, 8ÿ3 and 2ÿ0 respectively. The Giants would go on to win the 2012 World Series in a four-game sweep at Comerica Park.\\r\\nThe stadium hosted of the semifinal and final rounds of the 2013 World Baseball Classic on March 17ÿ19.\\r\\nOn July 23, 2013, due to a previous rain-out in Cincinnati, AT&T Park served as the \\"home\\" venue of the Cincinnati Reds for the second game of a doubleheader against the Giants.[31] Giants manager Bruce Bochy won his 1,500th career game.\\r\\nOn June 25, 2014 Tim Lincecum pitched the 3rd no hitter at AT&T Park against the San Diego Padres in a 4-0 win. It was his 2nd no hitter of his career, with both of them coming against the Padres. His first one was in San Diego on July 13, 2013.\\r\\nAT&T Park hosted Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 2014 World Series on October 24, 25, and 26. The Giants beat the Kansas City Royals 2 out of the 3 games played at AT&T Park, losing Game 3, 3ÿ2, before winning Games 4 and 5, 11ÿ4 and 5ÿ0 respectively. They ultimately went on to win the series in seven games, with the clinching game played at Kauffman Stadium rather than at AT&T Park. As of 2017, the Giants have not hosted a World Series clincher at AT&T Park, but they did host one at Candlestick Park in 1962, which was won by the New York Yankees.\\r\\nOn June 15, 2015, the Giants set a record for most consecutive home losses at AT&T Park at nine straight games with a 5-1 loss to the Seattle Mariners. This losing streak was the Giants' longest since an 11-game home loss streak at the Polo Grounds in New York in 1940.[32]\\r\\nFrom October 1, 2010 to July 18, 2017, AT&T Park recorded 530 consecutive sellouts, the second longest in Major League history behind Fenway Park's 794 consecutive sellouts from 2003ÿ13.\\r\\nGiants Enterprises, a wholly owned subsidiary of the San Francisco Giants created and headed by longtime team executive Pat Gallagher, brings non-baseball events to AT&T Park on days when the Giants do not play. Prominent among these has been the usage of the stadium for football. It has also hosted a range of other sporting and musical events.\\r\\nThe park was home to the XFL's San Francisco Demons in 2001, was the home of the East-West Shrine Game (until 2006), and was the former home stadium of the California Redwoods of the UFL in 2009.\\r\\nFrom 2002 to 2013, it has also been home to college football's Fight Hunger Bowl, previously the San Francisco Bowl and most recently the Emerald Bowl. In 2011, AT&T Park became the temporary home football stadium for the California Golden Bears while Cal's on-campus stadium, California Memorial Stadium, underwent renovation.[33]\\r\\nAT&T Park also hosted its first high school football game in 2011, the Central Coast Section Division III football championship game between long-time San Francisco rivals St. Ignatius College Preparatory and Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory.[34]\\r\\nOn February 10, 2006, the U.S. men's soccer team defeated Japan 3ÿ2 at AT&T in a friendly.\\r\\nA match of the 2011 World Football Challenge between Manchester City and Club America was held at AT&T, drawing a crowd of 11,250.\\r\\nA virtual recreation of the park was created as a gig venue for Guitar Hero World Tour.\\r\\nIn the game Watch Dogs 2, a stadium, called Nudle Park, based on AT&T Park is recreated.

Hughes is best known as a leader of the Harlem Renaissance in New York City. He famously wrote about the period that \\"the negro was in vogue\\", which was later paraphrased as \\"when Harlem was in vogue\\".[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many African Americans, Hughes had a complex ancestry. Both of Hughes' paternal great-grandmothers were enslaved African Americans and both of his paternal great-grandfathers were white slave owners in Kentucky. According to Hughes, one of these men was Sam Clay, a Scottish-American whiskey distiller of Henry County and supposedly a relative of the statesman Henry Clay. The other was Silas Cushenberry, a Jewish-American slave trader of Clark County.[2][3] Hughes's maternal grandmother Mary Patterson was of African-American, French, English and Native American descent. One of the first women to attend Oberlin College, she married Lewis Sheridan Leary, also of mixed race, before her studies. Leary subsequently joined John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859 and died from his wounds.[3]\\r\\nIn 1869 the widow Mary Patterson Leary married again, into the elite, politically active Langston family. (See The Talented Tenth.) Her second husband was Charles Henry Langston, of African-American, Euro-American and Native American ancestry.[4][5] He and his younger brother John Mercer Langston worked for the abolitionist cause and helped lead the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society [6] in 1858. Charles Langston later moved to Kansas, where he was active as an educator and activist for voting and rights for African Americans.[4] Charles and Mary's daughter Caroline was the mother of Langston Hughes.[7]\\r\\nLangston Hughes was born in Joplin, Missouri, the second child of school teacher Carrie (Caroline) Mercer Langston and James Nathaniel Hughes (1871ÿ1934).[8] Langston Hughes grew up in a series of Midwestern small towns. Hughes' father left his family and later divorced Carrie. He traveled to Cuba and then Mexico, seeking to escape the enduring racism in the United States.[9]\\r\\nAfter his parents separated, his mother traveled seeking employment, and young Langston Hughes was raised mainly in Lawrence, Kansas by his maternal grandmother, Mary Patterson Langston. Through the black American oral tradition and drawing from the activist experiences of her generation, Mary Langston instilled in her grandson a lasting sense of racial pride.[10][11][12] He spent most of his childhood in Lawrence. In his 1940 autobiography The Big Sea he wrote: \\"I was unhappy for a long time, and very lonesome, living with my grandmother. Then it was that books began to happen to me, and I began to believe in nothing but books and the wonderful world in bookswhere if people suffered, they suffered in beautiful language, not in monosyllables, as we did in Kansas.\\"[13]\\r\\nAfter the death of his grandmother, Hughes went to live with family friends, James and Mary Reed, for two years. Later, Hughes lived again with his mother Carrie in Lincoln, Illinois. She had remarried when he was still an adolescent, and eventually they moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where he attended high school.\\r\\nHis writing experiments began when he was young. While in grammar school in Lincoln, Hughes was elected class poet. He stated that in retrospect he thought it was because of the stereotype about African Americans having rhythm.[14]\\r\\nI was a victim of a stereotype. There were only two of us Negro kids in the whole class and our English teacher was always stressing the importance of rhythm in poetry. Well, everyone knows, except us, that all Negroes have rhythm, so they elected me as class poet.[15]\\r\\nDuring high school in Cleveland, Hughes wrote for the school newspaper, edited the yearbook, and began to write his first short stories, poetry,[16] and dramatic plays. His first piece of jazz poetry, \\"When Sue Wears Red,\\" was written while he was in high school.[17]\\r\\nHughes had a very poor relationship with his father, with whom he lived in Mexico for a brief period in 1919. Upon graduating from high school in June 1920, Hughes returned to Mexico to live with his father, hoping to convince him to support his plan to attend Columbia University. Hughes later said that, prior to arriving in Mexico, \\"I had been thinking about my father and his strange dislike of his own people. I didn't understand it, because I was a Negro, and I liked Negroes very much.\\"[18][19] Initially, his father had hoped for Hughes to attend a university abroad, and to study for a career in engineering. On these grounds, he was willing to provide financial assistance to his son but did not support his desire to be a writer. Eventually, Hughes and his father came to a compromise: Hughes would study engineering, so long as he could attend Columbia. His tuition provided; Hughes left his father after more than a year. While at Columbia in 1921, Hughes managed to maintain a B+ grade average. He left in 1922 because of racial prejudice. He was attracted more to the people and the neighborhood of Harlem than his studies, though he continued writing poetry.[20]\\r\\nHughes worked at various odd jobs, before serving a brief tenure as a crewman aboard the S.S. Malone in 1923, spending six months traveling to West Africa and Europe.[21] In Europe, Hughes left the S.S. Malone for a temporary stay in Paris.[22] There he met and had a romance with Anne Marie Coussey, a British-educated African from a well-to-do Gold Coast family; they subsequently corresponded but she eventually married Hugh Wooding, a promising Trinidadian lawyer.[23][24](Wooding went on to become chancellor of the University of the West Indies;[25]\\r\\nDuring his time in England in the early 1920s, Hughes became part of the black expatriate community. In November 1924, he returned to the U.S. to live with his mother in Washington, D.C. After assorted odd jobs, he gained white-collar employment in 1925 as a personal assistant to the historian Carter G. Woodson at the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. As the work demands limited his time for writing, Hughes quit the position to work as a busboy at the Wardman Park Hotel. There he encountered the poet Vachel Lindsay, with whom he shared some poems. Impressed with the poems, Lindsay publicized his discovery of a new black poet. By this time, Hughes's earlier work had been published in magazines and was about to be collected into his first book of poetry.\\r\\nThe following year, Hughes enrolled in Lincoln University, a historically black university in Chester County, Pennsylvania. He joined the Omega Psi Phi fraternity.[26][27] Thurgood Marshall, who later became an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, was a classmate of Hughes during his undergraduate studies.\\r\\nAfter Hughes earned a B.A. degree from Lincoln University in 1929, he returned to New York. Except for travels to the Soviet Union and parts of the Caribbean, he lived in Harlem as his primary home for the remainder of his life. During the 1930s, he became a resident of Westfield, New Jersey.[28][29]\\r\\nSome academics and biographers believe that Hughes was homosexual and included homosexual codes in many of his poems, as did Walt Whitman, whom Hughes said influenced his poetry. Hughes's story \\"Blessed Assurance\\" deals with a father's anger over his son's effeminacy and \\"queerness\\".[30]:192[30]:161[31][32][33][34][35][36] The biographer Aldrich argues that, in order to retain the respect and support of black churches and organizations and avoid exacerbating his precarious financial situation, Hughes remained closeted.[37]\\r\\nArnold Rampersad, the primary biographer of Hughes, determined that Hughes exhibited a preference for African-American men in his work and life.[38] But, in his biography Rampersad denies Hughes's homosexuality,[39] and concludes that Hughes was probably asexual and passive in his sexual relationships. Hughes did, however, show a respect and love for his fellow black man (and woman). Other scholars argue for his homosexuality: his love of black men is evidenced in a number of reported unpublished poems to an alleged black male lover.[40]\\r\\nOn May 22, 1967, Hughes died in New York City at the age of 65 from complications after abdominal surgery related to prostate cancer. His ashes are interred beneath a floor medallion in the middle of the foyer in the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem.[41] It is the entrance to an auditorium named for him.[42] The design on the floor is an African cosmogram entitled Rivers. The title is taken from his poem \\"The Negro Speaks of Rivers\\". Within the center of the cosmogram is the line: \\"My soul has grown deep like the rivers\\".\\r\\nfrom \\"The Negro Speaks of Rivers\\" (1920)\\r\\n...\\r\\nMy soul has grown deep like the rivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nI bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.\\r\\nI built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.\\r\\nI looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.\\r\\nI heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln\\r\\n????????went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy\\r\\n????????bosom turn all golden in the sunset....\\r\\nFirst published in 1921 in The Crisis  official magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)  \\"The Negro Speaks of Rivers\\", which became Hughes's signature poem, was collected in his first book of poetry The Weary Blues (1926).[44] Hughes's first and last published poems appeared in The Crisis; more of his poems were published in The Crisis than in any other journal.[45] Hughes' life and work were enormously influential during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, alongside those of his contemporaries, Zora Neale Hurston, Wallace Thurman, Claude McKay, Countee Cullen, Richard Bruce Nugent, and Aaron Douglas. Except for McKay, they worked together also to create the short-lived magazine Fire!! Devoted to Younger Negro Artists.\\r\\nHughes and his contemporaries had different goals and aspirations than the black middle class. Hughes and his fellows tried to depict the \\"low-life\\" in their art, that is, the real lives of blacks in the lower social-economic strata. They criticized the divisions and prejudices within the black community based on skin color.[46] Hughes wrote what would be considered their manifesto, \\"The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain\\", published in The Nation in 1926:\\r\\n\\"The younger Negro artists who create now intend to express our individual dark-skinned selves without fear or shame. If white people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, it doesn't matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly, too. The tom-tom cries, and the tom-tom laughs. If colored people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, their displeasure doesn't matter either. We build our temples for tomorrow, strong as we know how, and we stand on top of the mountain free within ourselves.\\"[47]\\r\\nHis poetry and fiction portrayed the lives of the working-class blacks in America, lives he portrayed as full of struggle, joy, laughter, and music. Permeating his work is pride in the African-American identity and its diverse culture. \\"My seeking has been to explain and illuminate the Negro condition in America and obliquely that of all human kind,\\"[48] Hughes is quoted as saying. He confronted racial stereotypes, protested social conditions, and expanded African Americas image of itself; a \\"people's poet\\" who sought to reeducate both audience and artist by lifting the theory of the black aesthetic into reality.[49]\\r\\nThe night is beautiful,\\r\\nSo the faces of my people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stars are beautiful,\\r\\nSo the eyes of my people\\r\\n\\r\\nBeautiful, also, is the sun.\\r\\nBeautiful, also, are the souls of my people.\\r\\nHughes stressed a racial consciousness and cultural nationalism devoid of self-hate. His thought united people of African descent and Africa across the globe to encourage pride in their diverse black folk culture and black aesthetic. Hughes was one of the few prominent black writers to champion racial consciousness as a source of inspiration for black artists.[51] His African-American race consciousness and cultural nationalism would influence many foreign black writers, including Jacques Roumain, Nicols Guilln, Lopold Sdar Senghor, and Aim Csaire. Along with the works of Senghor, Csaire, and other French-speaking writers of Africa and of African descent from the Caribbean, such as Ren Maran from Martinique and Lon Damas from French Guiana in South America, the works of Hughes helped to inspire the Ngritude movement in France. A radical black self-examination was emphasized in the face of European colonialism.[52][53] In addition to his example in social attitudes, Hughes had an important technical influence by his emphasis on folk and jazz rhythms as the basis of his poetry of racial pride.[54]\\r\\nIn 1930, his first novel, Not Without Laughter, won the Harmon Gold Medal for literature. At a time before widespread arts grants, Hughes gained the support of private patrons and he was supported for two years prior to publishing this novel.[55] The protagonist of the story is a boy named Sandy, whose family must deal with a variety of struggles due to their race and class, in addition to relating to one another.\\r\\nIn 1931, Hughes helped form the \\"New York Suitcase Theater\\" with playwright Paul Peters, artist Jacob Burck, and writer (soon-to-be underground spy) Whittaker Chambers, an acquaintance from Columbia.[56] In 1932, he was part of a board to produce a Soviet film on \\"Negro Life\\" with Malcolm Cowley, Floyd Dell, and Chambers.[56]\\r\\nIn 1932, Hughes and Ellen Winter wrote a pageant to Caroline Decker in an attempt to celebrate her work with the striking coal miners of the Harlan County War, but it was never performed. It was judged to be a \\"long, artificial propaganda vehicle too complicated and too cumbersome to be performed.\\"[57]\\r\\nMaxim Lieber became his literary agent, 1933ÿ45 and 1949ÿ50. (Chambers and Lieber worked in the underground together around 1934ÿ35.)[58]\\r\\nHughes' first collection of short stories was published in 1934 with The Ways of White Folks. He finished the book at a Carmel, California cottage provided for a year by Noel Sullivan, another patron.[59][60] These stories are a series of vignettes revealing the humorous and tragic interactions between whites and blacks. Overall, they are marked by a general pessimism about race relations, as well as a sardonic realism.[61] He also became an advisory board member to the (then) newly formed San Francisco Workers' School (later the California Labor School).\\r\\nIn 1935, Hughes received a Guggenheim Fellowship. The same year that Hughes established his theatre troupe in Los Angeles, he realized an ambition related to films by co-writing the screenplay for Way Down South.[62] Hughes believed his failure to gain more work in the lucrative movie trade was due to racial discrimination within the industry.\\r\\nIn Chicago, Hughes founded The Skyloft Players in 1941, which sought to nurture black playwrights and offer theatre \\"from the black perspective.\\"[63] Soon thereafter, he was hired to write a column for the Chicago Defender, in which he presented some of his \\"most powerful and relevant work\\", giving voice to black people. The column ran for twenty years. In 1943, Hughes began publishing stories about a character he called Jesse B. Semple, often referred to and spelled \\"Simple\\", the everyday black man in Harlem who offered musings on topical issues of the day.[63] Although Hughes seldom responded to requests to teach at colleges, in 1947 he taught at Atlanta University. In 1949, he spent three months at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools as a visiting lecturer. Between 1942 and 1949 Hughes was a frequent writer and served on the editorial board of Common Ground, a literary magazine focused on cultural pluralism in the United States published by the Common Council for American Unity (CCAU).\\r\\nHe wrote novels, short stories, plays, poetry, operas, essays, and works for children. With the encouragement of his best friend and writer, Arna Bontemps, and patron and friend, Carl Van Vechten, he wrote two volumes of autobiography, The Big Sea and I Wonder as I Wander, as well as translating several works of literature into English.\\r\\nFrom the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, Hughes' popularity among the younger generation of black writers varied even as his reputation increased worldwide. With the gradual advance toward racial integration, many black writers considered his writings of black pride and its corresponding subject matter out of date. They considered him a racial chauvinist.[64] He found some new writers, among them James Baldwin, lacking in such pride, over-intellectual in their work, and occasionally vulgar.[65][66][67]\\r\\nHughes wanted young black writers to be objective about their race, but not to scorn it or flee it.[51] He understood the main points of the Black Power movement of the 1960s, but believed that some of the younger black writers who supported it were too angry in their work. Hughes's work Panther and the Lash, posthumously published in 1967, was intended to show solidarity with these writers, but with more skill and devoid of the most virulent anger and racial chauvinism some showed toward whites.[68][69] Hughes continued to have admirers among the larger younger generation of black writers. He often helped writers by offering advice and introducing them to other influential persons in the literature and publishing communities. This latter group, including Alice Walker, whom Hughes discovered, looked upon Hughes as a hero and an example to be emulated within their own work. One of these young black writers (Loften Mitchell) observed of Hughes:\\r\\n\\"Langston set a tone, a standard of brotherhood and friendship and cooperation, for all of us to follow. You never got from him, 'I am the Negro writer,' but only 'I am a Negro writer.' He never stopped thinking about the rest of us.\\"[70]\\r\\nHughes, like many black writers and artists of his time, was drawn to the promise of Communism as an alternative to a segregated America. Many of his lesser-known political writings have been collected in two volumes published by the University of Missouri Press and reflect his attraction to Communism. An example is the poem \\"A New Song\\".[71]\\r\\nIn 1932, Hughes became part of a group of black people who went to the Soviet Union to make a film depicting the plight of African Americans in the United States. The film was never made, but Hughes was given the opportunity to travel extensively through the Soviet Union and to the Soviet-controlled regions in Central Asia, the latter parts usually closed to Westerners. While there, he met Robert Robinson, an African American living in Moscow and unable to leave. In Turkmenistan, Hughes met and befriended the Hungarian author Arthur Koestler, then a Communist who was given permission to travel there.\\r\\nAs later noted in Koestler's autobiography, Hughes, together with some forty other Black Americans, had originally been invited to the Soviet Union to produce a Soviet film on \\"Negro Life\\",[72] but the Soviets dropped the film idea because of their 1933 success in getting the US to recognize the Soviet Union and establish an embassy in Moscow. This entailed a toning down of Soviet propaganda on racial segregation in America. Hughes and his fellow Blacks were not informed of the reasons for the cancelling, but he and Koestler worked it out for themselves.[73]\\r\\nHughes also managed to travel to China and Japan before returning to the States.\\r\\nHughes's poetry was frequently published in the CPUSA newspaper and he was involved in initiatives supported by Communist organizations, such as the drive to free the Scottsboro Boys. Partly as a show of support for the Republican faction during the Spanish Civil War, in 1937 Hughes traveled to Spain[74] as a correspondent for the Baltimore Afro-American and other various African-American newspapers. In August 1937 he broadcast live from Madrid alongside Harry Haywood and Walter Benjamin Garland. Hughes was also involved in other Communist-led organizations such as the John Reed Clubs and the League of Struggle for Negro Rights. He was more of a sympathizer than an active participant. He signed a 1938 statement supporting Joseph Stalin's purges and joined the American Peace Mobilization in 1940 working to keep the U.S. from participating in World War II.[75]\\r\\nHughes initially did not favor black American involvement in the war because of the persistence of discriminatory U.S. Jim Crow laws and racial segregation and disfranchisement throughout the South. He came to support the war effort and black American participation after deciding that war service would aid their struggle for civil rights at home.[76] The scholar Anthony Pinn has noted that Hughes, together with Lorraine Hansberry and Richard Wright, was a humanist \\"critical of belief in God. They provided a foundation for nontheistic participation in social struggle.\\" Pinn has found that such writers are sometimes ignored in the narrative of American history that chiefly credits the civil rights movement to the work of affiliated Christian people.[77]\\r\\nHughes was accused of being a Communist by many on the political right, but he always denied it. When asked why he never joined the Communist Party, he wrote, \\"it was based on strict discipline and the acceptance of directives that I, as a writer, did not wish to accept.\\" In 1953, he was called before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations led by Senator Joseph McCarthy. He stated, \\"I never read the theoretical books of socialism or communism or the Democratic or Republican parties for that matter, and so my interest in whatever may be considered political has been non-theoretical, non-sectarian, and largely emotional and born out of my own need to find some way of thinking about this whole problem of myself.\\"[78] Following his testimony, Hughes distanced himself from Communism.[79] He was rebuked by some on the Radical Left who had previously supported him. He moved away from overtly political poems and towards more lyric subjects. When selecting his poetry for his Selected Poems (1959) he excluded all his radical socialist verse from the 1930s.[79]\\r\\nHughes was featured reciting his poetry on the album Weary Blues (MGM, 1959), with music by Charles Mingus and Leonard Feather, and he also contributed lyrics to Randy Weston's Uhuru Afrika (Roulette, 1960).\\r\\nHughes' life has been portrayed in film and stage productions since the late 20th century. In Looking for Langston (1989), British filmmaker Isaac Julien claimed him as a black gay icon? Julien thought that Hughes' sexuality had historically been ignored or downplayed. Film portrayals of Hughes include Gary LeRoi Gray's role as a teenage Hughes in the short subject film Salvation (2003) (based on a portion of his autobiography The Big Sea), and Daniel Sunjata as Hughes in the Brother to Brother (2004). Hughes' Dream Harlem, a documentary by Jamal Joseph, examines Hughes' works and environment.\\r\\nPaper Armor (1999) by Eisa Davis and Hannibal of the Alps (2005)[80] by Michael Dinwiddie are plays by African-American playwrights that address Hughes's sexuality. Spike Lee's 1996 film Get on the Bus, included a black gay character, played by Isaiah Washington, who invokes the name of Hughes and punches a homophobic character, saying, \\"This is for James Baldwin and Langston Hughes.\\"\\r\\nHughes was also featured prominently in a national campaign sponsored by the Center for Inquiry (CFI) known as African Americans for Humanism.[81]\\r\\nHughes' Ask Your Mama: 12 Moods for Jazz, written in 1960, was performed for the first time in March 2009 with specially composed music by Laura Karpman at Carnegie Hall, at the Honor festival curated by Jessye Norman in celebration of the African-American cultural legacy.[82] Ask Your Mama is the centerpiece of \\"The Langston Hughes Project\\",[83] a multimedia concert performance directed by Ron McCurdy, professor of music in the Thornton School of Music at the University of Southern California.[84] The European premiere of The Langston Hughes Project, featuring Ice-T and McCurdy, took place at the Barbican Centre, London, on November 21, 2015, as part of the London Jazz Festival.[85]\\r\\nOn September 22, 2016, his poem \\"I, Too\\" was printed on a full page of the New York Times in response to the riots of the previous day in Charlotte, North Carolina.[86]\\r\\nThe Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University holds the Langston Hughes papers (1862ÿ1980) and the Langston Hughes collection (1924ÿ1969) containing letters, manuscripts, personal items, photographs, clippings, artworks, and objects that document the life of Hughes. The Langston Hughes Memorial Library on the campus of Lincoln University, as well as at the James Weldon Johnson Collection within the Yale University also hold archives of Hughes' work.[87]","input":"What is the title of langston hughes 's first book of poetry?"},{"output":"Swiss race car driver and automotive engineer Louis Chevrolet","context":"","input":"What is the origin of the word chevrolet?"},{"output":"November 2006","context":"This is a page on the global operations of Krispy Kreme.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian franchise agreement also covers New Zealand however currently there are no store locations there. On October 29, 2010, the Australian division went into voluntary administration, with media reports attributing this to poor sales.[1] As a result of this administration, several stores closed in early November 2010. As of December 2010, they have come out of Administration, and have continued trading with their remaining stores in the states of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. With hour long waits during the opening of their drive-through restaurants, and to this day, a free hot Original Glazed doughnut is offered to every customer making a purchase. The Australian chain has a strong fundraising program which has helped schools, workplaces, charities and non-profit organisations to raise over 10 million dollars to date. Also, unique to Australia[citation needed], is a range of ice creams. A number of Australian stores have also started selling a Bakery range, including sandwiches, croissants, muffins etc.[citation needed]. Krispy Kreme announced partnership with 7-Eleven in December 2011, and their products are currently sold in all 600 7-Eleven stores within Australia.[2]\\r\\nKrispy Kreme first opened in Australia in 2003 in Penrith, 60?km west of Sydney, just off Mulgoa Road in the Penrith Panthers Football Club complex. It was the first store in the world outside the United States. The store used to offer a 24-hour drive-through service. Before opening they gave away 300,000 free doughnuts for publicity.\\r\\nSince then, ten Krispy Kreme stores have opened in NSW. They now have multiple stores inside Sydney Airport, as well as Krispy Kreme Mascot located at 7 Ross Smith Avenue, adjacent to the airport. Also Krispy Kreme Liverpool. Both of these store have 24-hour drive-thru. Other stores in NSW include Auburn (on parramatta road), and a small store at central station.\\r\\nKrispy Kreme has two stores in Brisbane; the Brisbane Airport and in the Myer Centre, although many mini-stores or 'carts' are in various service centres along major roads.

The most recent Krispy Kreme outlet in Queensland opened at Pacific Fair, Broadbeach, on the Gold Coast. The Albert Street store in Brisbane closed down leaving the Myer Centre store the only Krispy Kreme store in the Brisbane CBD. The stores are supplied by daily deliveries of doughnuts cooked at the commissary facility in Logan, south of Brisbane.\\r\\nFew Krispy Kreme stores remain in operation in Melbourne. The first store opened on June 22, 2006, at 6:30?am[3] in the suburb of Narre Warren at Fountain Gate Shopping Centre, and features a 24-hour drive-through service. Though most store-locations outside of Australia usually operate with a long schedule including both early mornings and late nights, the twenty-four-hour operating model is unique to Sydney and Melbourne. The store is currently hugely popular amongst Melbournians, some of whom queued for several hours during the store's first few weeks running. The drive-through queue during this period was often over 500 metres long and has been controlled by hired security guards and Narre Warren police, who directed traffic and calmed customers. When the store first opened, people had waited for 3 days creating a drive through line over 2 kilometres long. The drive through line did not stop until about three weeks after the opening and the internal store was constantly forced to remove people from the building after closing hours[citation needed].\\r\\nKrispy Kreme opened its second Melbourne store in the Central Business District on Collins Street. The store opened on September 26, 2006. Unlike the Fountain Gate store, doughnuts are not produced on site, but rather delivered many times during the day from both Fountain Gate and Dandenong.

His father reassures him that family bonds can't be broken by distance. Tamaki wakes up and mentions that he wasn't invited to the New Year party at the main residence again and so it's unlikely that he will succeed his Grandmother, who is chairman of the Suoh business and lives at the main residence. He realises he's late to meet the others at the Asakusa temple. On meeting up, Hikaru notices that Tamaki is distracted and challenges him to a competition to buy something that Haruhi will love the most. They split up, but later on Tamaki runs into Haruhi. Tamaki mentions Hikaru, and Haruhi confesses that she hates herself for not realising his feelings sooner and questions how she can succeed as a lawyer if she's so dense. Tamaki reassures her and tells her to be more confident. He gives her an Ootoro Ring, which he bought earlier as part of Hikaru's challenge, which cheers her up. Seeing her happiness, Tamaki wonders what kind of love he feels for Haruhi and absent-mindedly touches her face -  embarrassing them both. Tamaki explains to Haruhi that he's not really her father, and Haruhi calls him an idiot and says she never thought of him like a father. Embarrassed, she runs away and Tamaki chases after her. He finds her Ootoro Ring on the ground, but Haruhi has disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n64: The Host Club realise that Haruhi has been kidnapped. They trace her mobile phone to find her location, and Kyoya works out that the kidnappers are people having business problems with the Suohs. Tamaki, Hikaru, Hunny and Mori reach the location and find Haruhi unharmed. Tamaki embraces her in relief. Hikaru makes sure to break up the embrace and express his concern too. Tamaki tells off the kidnappers, but also says he'll help them with their problems. Haruhi wants to return to Asakusa, and Tamaki realises it's because of the Ootoro Ring that she dropped and returns it to her. Hikaru gets a little jealous seeing how happy it makes her. Kousaka, the Suoh's lawyer who was loitering around the whole day, makes a call to Tamaki's grandmother and wants to discuss the issue of Tamaki moving into the main residence.\\r\\n\\r\\n65: The Host Club are hosting a horse riding day. Tamaki has been acting distracted, and Hikaru wonders if Tamaki has realised his feelings for Haruhi yet. A new girl called Kanoya get into trouble with the horses and Tamaki protects her, but ends up hurt. Kanoya is grateful to Tamaki and thanks him by making him lunch, whilst he offers to show her around Tokyo. The others comment on how much Kanoya looks like Haruhi, except her personality is submissive instead. Tamaki and Kanoya start spending more time together. Kyouya reveals Kanoya has family problems like Tamaki and Hikaru comments that she is perfect for Tamaki and they have a lot in common - Tamaki overhears this. Later, Tamaki is with Kanoya when Haruhi walks by, dropping a book. Tamaki picks it up for her and comments on how different she is to him. Haruhi takes it as an insult and leaves, forgetting one of her books. Tamaki tries to return it to her, but Kanoya stops him by confessing her love to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n68: Tamaki reminisces on how stupidly he has acted towards Haruhi, particularly his insistence on treating her like a daughter. He remembers how his father's actions to choose love broke up his family and he's scared that he will do the same to his Host Club family. This reminds him of how Hikaru said that their bond won't be easily broken. Mori later also tells him to be honest with himself and know that everyone in the Host Club trusts him.  At the curry challenge, Kanoya has a difficult task to make a curry out of terrible ingredients, but as a cook's daughter she gets back her confidence and does well. In the final 'truth' challenge Kanoya admits that she misses her dad and Haruhi encourages her to be honest with her family about her feelings. Haruhi also tells off Tamaki for keeping secrets from the Host Club and lets him know that they all want to support him ÿ whatever it is! Tamaki realises that, despite being scared of losing his friends, he is ready to tell Haruhi how he feels.\\r\\n\\r\\n69: In a flashback, Tamaki tells Hikaru that he also loves Haruhi. Walking to school, Haruhi is still wondering what Tamaki's secret is when he arrives on a Segway. He tries to confess but starts babbling nervously and makes Haruhi run away. Tamaki is full of self-confidence and thinks it's a sign she loves him. Hikaru tells Tamaki not to presume that he knows her feelings, but Tamaki of course doesn't listen! Meanwhile, Kanoya tells Haruhi that she was depending on Tamaki too much, and probably just liked him as a father figure. Haruhi disagrees because seeing them together made her jealous. Haruhi goes to the clubroom wondering what she sees in Tamaki ÿ only to find him singing 'Happy Birthday' to himself like a fool. Tamaki's confidence evaporates on seeing Haruhi and he hides and starts to wonder whether he is right to assume she likes him. It is revealed that it's Haruhi's birthday next week and Tamaki and Hikaru both imagine buying her a present that will make her fall in love with them. Kyouya gets a phone call and reveals he knows something about the \\"lying lawyer\\" Kousaka.\\r\\n\\r\\n70: Kyouya has found out that Kousaka has been secretly and regularly meeting with Tamaki's grandmother, and also has a link to Haruhi's family. Kousaka visits Haruhi's dad and it's revealed that she was classmates with Haruhi's mother. She warns Ranka that Haruhi should stay away from the Suoh family and Ouran. Meanwhile, Tamaki and Hikaru are trying to work out the perfect birthday present for Haruhi ÿ finally agreeing that she'd like something low-cost and useful since she's a commoner. They end up both giving her the same thing - a Prawn Rice Water Flowing kit - but Haruhi prefers the Shiitake Mushroom kit from Ritsu.\\r\\n\\r\\n73: Tamaki is still excited by the accidental kiss but doubts whether it meant anything to Haruhi. He is interrupted by someone that has come to see him from the main house. The lawyer Kousaka reveals she has convinced Tamaki's grandmother to let Tamaki enter the main house, and is hoping she'll get a big monetary reward from Tamaki's father. Tamaki visits Haruhi to tell her he's moving into the main house and so will be busy all holidays, but hopes to see her in the new school year. Haruhi is really happy for Tamaki. Kyouya also hears the news but has a bad feeling about it. Tamaki's grandmother says she'll be strictly supervising Tamaki.\\r\\n\\r\\n74: Tamaki is told that he can't see his staff and pet dog from the 2nd house anymore. He'll also be expected to study all holidays. Tamaki's father greets him, and Tamaki begs to see his staff and dog, but he is told to obey his grandmother. Tamaki has to eat dinner alone, but resolves to make the best of his new situation because he'll still be able to see his friends in the new school year. School restarts, and Haruhi discovers that Tamaki can't join the Host Club as he has to study after school, his grandmother is ignoring him, and the staff at the main residence have been told not to speak to him. Tamaki remains optimistic that he'll be able to win over his grandmother and rejoin the Host Club, but admits he's lonely and wants to have lunch with everyone. Unfortunately, with the Host Club suspended, all the Host Club guests also want time with Tamaki and he gets taken away. Separately, Haruhi and Tamaki are both longing to speak to each other again. The chapter ends with Tamaki confirming to his grandmother that he'll leave the Host Club as she wishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n77: Tamaki is trying to bond with his grandmother at the main house. At school, Haruhi and Tamaki no longer speak and she is continuing to dress shabby. She tells Mei that she'll continue until Tamaki reconciles with his family. Kyouya calls a meeting and tells everyone that Tamaki's mum has SLE syndrome, but thinks she may be taking an experimental drug to get better. They later discover that Kyouya's family have made a valuable deal with a company led by Tamaki's father to exclusively sell the drug, which will give Tamaki's father a chance to gain independence from Tamaki's grandmother. Unfortunately this deal shatters Tamaki's dream of having a happy family.\\r\\n\\r\\n78: Side story about the Hitachiin family.\\r\\n\\r\\n81: Still at the airport, Tamaki is in pieces over Haruhi's confession and Haruhi starts to have second thoughts ÿ finally giving Tamaki the courage to kiss her and convince her of his feelings! Tamaki's father and grandmother decide to take Haruhi's advice and speak honestly to each other to reconcile their differences. Back at school, Tamaki returns and the Host Club reopens. The twins don't think Haruhi and Tamaki have been acting like a couple, and we discover this is because Tamaki has been too busy trying to plan their first date. Meanwhile, Haruhi meets up with Kousaka to get some career advice. Later on Tamaki and Haruhi meet up and Haruhi asks Tamaki to go to the Amusement Park with her before he has the chance to ask her out on his carefully planned 'perfect date'. Haruhi finds his 'perfect date' notes, and finds it funny. She reassures him that she could never be bored as long as she's spending time with him. Tamaki tells Haruhi he loves her and she gets really flustered by his cuddles and loving stares.\\r\\n\\r\\n82: Tamaki and Haruhi meet for their first date. Tamaki typically goes overboard, but the rest of the Host Club try to fix all his mistakes before Haruhi notices and dumps him. They also intervene when the Zuka club see Haruhi and try to steal her away. Tamaki and Haruhi escape and Tamaki takes her to visit her mother's grave so that he can pay his respects. Tamaki admits that he knows Haruhi has been offered a 1 year scholarship in the USA, as she is one of Ouran's best students, and he agrees it will be a good experience for her. After hearing Tamaki's supportive words, Haruhi is convinced her decision to accept the offer is the right one - even though it means leaving a lot behind.","input":"How many ouran high school books are there?"},{"output":"locations in Savannah, Georgia; Atlanta, Georgia; Hong Kong; and Lacoste, France","context":"Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) is a private, nonprofit, accredited university[1] with locations in Savannah, Georgia; Atlanta, Georgia; Hong Kong; and Lacoste, France.\\r\\nFounded in 1978 to provide degrees in programs not yet offered in the southeast, the university now operates two locations in Georgia, a degree-granting location in Hong Kong, a degree-granting online education program, and a study abroad location in Lacoste, France with rotating course offerings.

Cobb, Jr.) became the session band for the newly opened Studio One recording studio in Doraville, Georgia, near Atlanta.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter playing on other artists' recordings, the Atlanta Rhythm Section was formed in January 1971, with Rodney Justo (singer), Barry Bailey (guitar), Paul Goddard (bass), Dean Daughtry (keyboards), Robert Nix (drums) and J.R. Cobb (guitar).\\r\\n\\r\\nSigned by Decca Records, the band released their first album, Atlanta Rhythm Section, in January 1972. Due to the record's limited commercial success, Justo quit the band, relocating to New York City as a session singer. He was replaced by Ronnie Hammond, assistant to Studio One's engineer, Rodney Mills. Buddy Buie, the band's manager and producer and co-owner of Studio One, is listed first on almost all of their songwriting credits. With Hammond on board, the band's second release, Back Up Against the Wall (February 1973), also failed to sell and Decca dumped ARS from their roster.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuie's manager, Jeff Franklin, who was based in New York and had gotten the group the Decca deal, was then able to get ARS signed to Polydor for their third release, Third Annual Pipe Dream, in August 1974. Mylon LeFevre performed on one of the album's tracks, \\"Jesus Hearted People.\\" (Buie, Bailey, Goddard, Daughtry and Rodney Mills had all been regular players at LeFevre's studio before they built Studio One.) Pipe Dream spun off the band's first hit single, \\"Doraville\\", which peaked at #35 and pulled the album up to #74 on Billboard's Top 200 by November 1974.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough considered a Southern rock band, the addition of Hammond led them towards a more laid-back sound incorporating Bailey's distinctive lead guitar and bassist Goddard's use of a flat pick, with Daughtry's acoustic and electric piano frequently at the forefront.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band's next two releases, Dog Days (August 1975) and Red Tape (April 1976), sold in lesser quantities, but ARS made more of an effort to take to the road in 1976 with numerous shows in the South, Northeast and Midwest. In August of that year they opened both for The Who at the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida and The Rolling Stones at the Municipal Auditorium in West Palm Beach, Florida.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe increased exposure paid off as the group's next album, A Rock and Roll Alternative (December 1976), rose to #13 on the Billboard chart and was certified gold in the spring of 1977. The debut single from the record, \\"So in to You\\", peaked at #7 on April 30.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 4, 1977 ARS played their biggest show yet, the Dog Day Rockfest at Atlanta's Grant Field on the campus of Georgia Tech. Heart and Foreigner were the opening acts and Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band co-headlined.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1978 ARS released what would turn out to be its most successful album, Champagne Jam, which led off with the song \\"Large Time\\", a tribute to Lynyrd Skynyrd, some of whom had lost their lives in a plane crash the previous October. Champagne Jam became their biggest selling album, selling over a million and certified platinum. The album provided two more hits for the band, \\"Imaginary Lover\\" (#7) and \\"I'm Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight\\" (#14).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 24, 1978 ARS appeared at the Knebworth Festival in Knebworth, England before a crowd of 60,000 on a bill that included Genesis, Jefferson Starship, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Brand X, Devo and Roy Harper.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 26, 1978 the band appeared at Canada Jam at Mosport Park in Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada before their largest audience yet (over 110,000) with the Doobie Brothers and the Commodores, among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following week, ARS had a rock festival of their own, Champagne Jam, at Grant Field at Georgia Tech on September 3, 1978, which also included Santana, the Doobie Brothers, Eddie Money, Mose Jones and Mother's Finest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree weeks later, they appeared at the White House at President Jimmy Carter's invitation for his son Chip's 28th  birthday party.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eighth Atlanta Rhythm Section album, Underdog, was released in June 1979 and produced Top 20 hits \\"Do It or Die\\" (#19) and \\"Spooky\\" (#17), a remake of Cobb's and Buie's 1968 Classics IV hit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1979 drummer Robert Nix, the group's primary lyricist, had a falling out with manager/producer Buie over the group's musical direction. Nix wished to move in a more rocking direction while Buie was content with their diversive approach, which incorporated the mellower ballads. The rest of the band's dissatisfaction with Nix's excessive \\"lifestyle choices\\" sealed his fate and he was replaced by Roy Yeager.\\r\\n\\r\\nChampagne Jam II on July 7, 1979 at Georgia Tech featured ARS, Aerosmith, the Cars, Dixie Dregs and Whiteface. In October, ARS performances from Champagne Jam II and elsewhere on the tour were released as the double live set Are You Ready. Besides the group's hits and popular tracks up to that time, the album also contained the fan favorite \\"Another Man's Woman\\", with Goddard's now famous bass solo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boys from Doraville (August 1980) showed a steep falling off in sales for the group as radio programmers began turning their attention away from Southern rock to other rock genres, such as New Wave. The album provided no hit singles and was their last for Polydor. Bruce Lundvall offered a better deal at Columbia Records (CBS), who released the next ARS album, Quinella, in August 1981, containing the hit \\"Alien\\" (#29) but, like The Boys From Doraville, struggled with sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1982 ARS worked on a second album for CBS, to be titled Longing For A Feeling. Before completion, CBS wanted the band to drop some of the tracks and record more. Buie and the band refused, the album was shelved, and CBS dropped its contract with ARS.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in 1982, singer Ronnie Hammond decided to leave ARS for a solo career, joined by Buie, though their work with Alabama musicians never resulted in commercial release. Buie continued to run Studio One until 1986 when he sold it to Georgia State University. Unfortunately, upkeep of the studio was too high and it was closed in 1989 and eventually razed to make way for a parking lot. Buie died at 74 on July 18, 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrummer Roy Yeager tripped over a fallen tree while on tour in 1982 and suffered a severe broken leg. One of the band's road crew, Danny Biget, took over on drums, and ARS persuaded Rodney Justo to return to do some shows in early 1983. Justo had moved from session singer to lead singer again in the mid-1970s with a group from Georgia called Beaverteeth. He then left the music industry for a number of years and eventually took up a sales position with a wine company.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 1983, the group went to Nashville and tried working with Buddy Buie's former associate Chips Moman, a more country-oriented producer. But results were slow to come and, dissatisfied with this direction, bassist Paul Goddard and drummer Biget left to work with British producer Eddy Offord in another band with former Dixie Dregs keyboardist T Lavitz and guitarist Pat Buchanan, called Interpol, that was in a more progressive rock direction; unfortunately, Interpol never got off the ground. The Chips Moman Nashville sessions were completed, but the results, like their previous effort for CBS, have never been released to date.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow without a recording contract, ARS continued to play shows, mostly in the South. Andy Anderson, who'd sung on the unreleased Moman project after Justo was let go, was the new front man and two new members, Tommy Stribling (bass) and Keith Hamrick (drums), were brought in by late 1983.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1985 the group tried a new singer, Jeff Logan, who had previously appeared with a band called High Cotton. But Logan's higher voice didn't fit with the band's musical style and Anderson soon returned as lead vocalist. Bassist Stribling went on to leave in February 1986, turning it over to Steve Stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 1986, J. R. Cobb left to concentrate more on songwriting and session work at Moman's new studio in Memphis (for The Highway Men, among others) and Stribling came back to play guitar. The personnel shuffles continued as Hamrick also departed in late 1986 and was replaced by Sean Burke (who joined in early 1987). Another new lead singer, Shaun Williamson, was rolled in in 1987. But in 1988, Williamson, Stribling and Stone were all let go as Bailey and Daughtry sought to revamp the band by bringing back Ronnie Hammond.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988 Hammond, Bailey and Daughtry returned to the studio with Sean Burke and two new players, Brendan O'Brien (guitar) and J. E. Garnett (bass), to produce a new album with producer Rodney Mills that had more of an \\"80s Rock sound\\". Released in October 1989 on the CBS/Epic subsidiary label Imagine, Truth in a Structured Form,  ARS's first album in eight years, featured a heavy drum sound that propelled almost every track and a sharper, more synthesized gloss over the songs, with all, except one, being written by Buddy Buie and Ronnie Hammond, another departure from their previous approach. O'Brien, who was co-producer as well as guitarist on the album, was invited to go on the road with the band but he declined, preferring to continue his career in session work (today he is a much in demand producer, having worked with Bob Dylan, Pearl Jam and Bruce Springsteen). Steve Stone then returned, as guitarist this time. But album sales for Truth lagged and there was another hiatus in their recorded work as the band continued to tour, with Justin Senker replacing Garnett on bass in 1992 (after subbing a show for him the previous year) and R.J. Vealey taking over the drum chair from Burke in 1995 after the latter suffered a leg injury.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995 the group went back into the studio, this time to re-record some of their classic songs. This new collection was recorded in North Carolina and the resulting live-in-studio sound of Atlanta Rhythm Section '96 (released on CMC International in April 1996) presented a different, less polished take on some of their classic tunes and captured the sound of their live performances from that period. It was also around this time that ARS was elected to the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. The band was so honored at a September 1996 induction ceremony at the Georgia World Congress Center.\\r\\n\\r\\nARS then recorded another new album, Partly Plugged (which was released in January 1997 on the independent Southern Tracks label). It featured some new songs done plugged in and more remakes of some classics done the way they had been written---unplugged on acoustic guitar and piano.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 28, 1998 there was a close call with tragedy. Singer Ronnie Hammond, who had battled alcoholism and depression off and on over the years, got into a confrontation with police in Macon, Georgia and forced an officer to shoot him. Hammond was seriously injured, but survived the injury and dealt with the depression.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band's fifteenth album, Eufaula, was released in February 1999 but problems occurred almost immediately as the record label it was released on, Platinum Entertainment, faced financial troubles and was not able to support the album as intended.\\r\\n\\r\\nARS continued to tour on a limited basis. But on November 13, 1999, tragedy struck. After the band had finished an afternoon set at a concert festival in Orlando, Florida, 37-year-old drummer R. J. Vealey complained of indigestion and then collapsed and died of a heart attack. \\"It was very sudden, very shocking\\", said guitarist Barry Bailey. \\"He was a great drummer, the best drummer this band ever had.\\" ARS then continued on upon recruiting new drummer Jim Keeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 1999, while Hammond was still recovering in the hospital, Andy Anderson returned after twelve years to front the band until Hammond was well enough to return (Anderson would return again in May 2000 to sub another show for Ronnie). But in 2001, Anderson was back once again after Ronnie decided to take a gig with another group, Voices of Classic Rock, that conflicted with ARS's schedule, forcing him to make a choice between the two. Ronnie chose to stay with VOCR but left the touring business altogether soon afterward to focus on family and songwriting. A retirement show for Ronnie was held on December 6, 2002 at the club Whiskey River in Macon; Ronnie performed, backed by Dean Daughtry, Justin Senker, Steve Stone, Jim Keeling, Wendall Cox (from Travis Tritt's band) and Mike Causey (from Stillwater). Hammond died on March 14, 2011 in Forsyth, Georgia, at age 60 of heart failure.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring its later days, the band has shown it can still draw the crowds it did its heyday, such as the 150,000 fans it drew to the Riverbend Festival in Chattanooga, Tennessee in June 2000.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2006, Barry Bailey, who was suffering from multiple sclerosis, decided to retire from the group to take care of his wife, who was sick with cancer (which ended up taking her life on July 6, 2006). Steve Stone played most of the lead from this point on and Andy Anderson's long-time Billy Joe Royal bandmate and golf buddy, Alan Accardi, was brought in as second guitarist. Alan, a Nashville veteran, would stay with the band for more than a year but it was clear that a player with more of a rock sound was needed, so a friend of Jim Keeling's, Huntsville, Alabama native David Anderson, from the band Brother Cane, was brought in as the new guitarist in April 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, former ARS drummer Roy Yeager was involved in a controversy concerning the destruction of a Tennessee American Civil War landmark.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 26, 2008 singer Andy Anderson suffered a heart attack just before he was to catch a plane to Las Vegas to join the band for a two-night stand at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino. Fortunately, Andy's friend, Steve Croson (who'd played alongside him for years in Billy Joe Royal's band), lived in Vegas and was able to step in on short notice. In April and May, original singer Rodney Justo returned, joined by ARS's 1987ÿ88 singer Shaun Williamson, until Andy was healthy enough to return in May.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2011 fans of the Atlanta Rhythm Section were stunned to see not only the permanent  return of Rodney Justo but the re-introduction of original bassist Paul Goddard to the stage after a 28-year absence. Unfortunately Paul's second tenure with the band was short-lived as he died of cancer on April 29, 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Paul's death, ARS continued to play shows with a lineup of Rodney Justo, Dean Daughtry, Steve Stone, Dave Anderson, Justin Senker, and Jim Keeling. Keeling was replaced in March 2016 by Justo's friend Rodger Stephan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band still tours, playing mostly festivals and nostalgia-themed concerts.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir most recent album, With All Due Respect (May 2011), was largely covers of other artists' songs (Lynyrd Skynyrd, Allman Brothers, etc.) alongside re-recordings of classic ARS tunes, done at Southern Tracks Studios with longtime engineer Rodney Mills.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile ARS did not achieve the commercial success of Lynyrd Skynyrd or The Allman Brothers, the group had a strong following in the South and charted a consistent string of hits: \\"Doraville\\", \\"I'm Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight\\", \\"So in to You\\", \\"Imaginary Lover\\", \\"Do It Or Die\\", and a cover of the 1968 Classics IV 1968 hit, \\"Spooky\\". Plus, there were fan favorites such as \\"Boogie Smoogie\\", \\"Champagne Jam\\", \\"Jukin'\\", \\"Neon Nites\\", and \\"Georgia Rhythm\\". The band also influenced a number of rock and country artists, notably Travis Tritt, who covered the ARS songs \\"Back Up Against the Wall\\" and \\"Homesick\\". The group Shudder to Think covered \\"So in to You\\".","input":"Who was the lead singer of the atlanta rhythm section?"},{"output":"James, son of Zebedee","context":"James, son of Zebedee (Hebrew: ???????? Ya?qob, Greek: ???; died 44?AD) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus, and traditionally considered the first apostle to be martyred. He was a son of Zebedee and Salome, and brother of John the Apostle. He is also called James the Greater or James the Great to distinguish him from James, son of Alphaeus and James the brother of Jesus (James the Just). James the son of Zebedee is the patron saint of Spaniards, and as such is often identified as Santiago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe son of Zebedee and Salome, James is styled \\"the Greater\\" to distinguish him from the Apostle James \\"the Less\\". He was the brother of John, the beloved disciple, and probably the elder of the two.[1]\\r\\nHis parents seem to have been people of means. Zebedee, his father, was a fisherman of the Sea of Galilee, who probably lived in or near Bethsaida, present Galilee, Israel, perhaps in Capernaum, and had some boatmen or hired men. Salome, his mother, was one of the pious women who afterwards followed Christ and \\"ministered unto him of their substance\\", and his brother John was personally known to the high-priest, and must have had wherewithal to provide for the Mother of Jesus.[1]\\r\\nIt is probable that his brother had not received the technical training of the rabbinical schools; in this sense they were unlearned and without any official position among the Jews. But, according to the social rank of their parents, they must have been men of ordinary education, in the common walks of Jewish life. James is described as one of the first disciples to join Jesus. The Synoptic Gospels state that James and John were with their father by the seashore when Jesus called them to follow him.[Matt. 4:21-22][Mk. 1:19-20] James was one of only three apostles whom Jesus selected to bear witness to his Transfiguration.[2] James and John[3] (or, in another tradition, their mother[4]) asked Jesus to grant them seats on his right and left in his glory. Jesus rebuked them, and the other ten apostles were annoyed with them. James and his brother wanted to call down fire on a Samaritan town, but were rebuked by Jesus.[Lk 9:51-6] The Acts of the Apostles records that \\"Herod the king\\" (traditionally identified with Herod Agrippa) had James executed by sword. He is the only apostle whose martyrdom is recorded in the New Testament. He is, thus, traditionally believed to be the first of the twelve apostles martyred for his faith.[Acts 12:1-2] Nixon suggests that this may have been caused by James' fiery temper,[5] for which he and his brother earned the nickname Boanerges or \\"Sons of Thunder\\".[Mark 3:17] F. F. Bruce contrasts this story to that of the Liberation of Saint Peter, and notes that \\"James should die while Peter should escape\\" is a \\"mystery of divine providence\\".[6]\\r\\nThe English name \\"James\\" comes from Italian \\"Giacomo\\", a variant of \\"Giacobo\\" derived from Iacobus (Jacob) in Latin, itself from the Greek ??? \\"Iakbos\\", from Hebrew ???????. In French, Jacob evolves into \\"Jacques\\". In eastern Spain, Iacobus (Jacobus) became \\"Jacome\\" or \\"Jaime\\"; in Catalan language, it became \\"Jaume\\". Santiago is the local Galician or Spanish (Castilian) evolution of Vulgar Latin Sanctu Iacobu \\"Saint James\\".[7] \\"Tiago\\" is a popular deglutination native to Portuguese language (santiago > san-tiago = S?o Tiago); it crossed with old Diago to give \\"Diego\\" in Spanish and \\"Diogo\\" in Portuguese, which is also the Spanish name of Saint Didacus of Alcal.[citation needed] For example, Miguel de Cervantes in his famous Don Quixote uses \\"San Diego\\" instead of \\"Santiago\\".\\r\\nSaint James is the patron saint of Spain and, according to legend, his remains are held in Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. (The name Santiago is the local evolution of Vulgar Latin Sanctu Iacobu, \\"Saint James\\".) The traditional pilgrimage to the grave of the saint, known as the \\"Way of St. James\\", has been the most popular pilgrimage for Western European Catholics from the Early Middle Ages onwards, although its modern revival and popularity stems from Walter Starkie's 1957 book, The Road to Santiago. The Pilgrims of St. James.[7] Some 237,886 pilgrims registered in 2014 as having completed the final 100?km walk (200?km by bicycle) to Santiago to qualify for a Compostela.[8] When 25 July falls on a Sunday, it is a \\"Jubilee\\" year (an A?o Santo Jubilar Compostelano or A?o Santo Jacobeo) and a special east door is opened for entrance into Santiago Cathedral. Jubilee years fall every 5, 6, and 11 years. In the 2004 Jubilee year, 179,944[9] pilgrims received a Compostela. In 2010 the number had risen to 275,135.[10]\\r\\nThe feast day of St. James is celebrated on 25 July on the liturgical calendars of the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran and certain Protestant churches. He is commemorated on 30 April in the Orthodox Christian liturgical calendar (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 30 April currently falls on 13 May of the modern Gregorian Calendar).\\r\\nThe site of martyrdom is located within the Armenian Apostolic Cathedral of St. James in the Armenian Quarter of Jerusalem. The Chapel of St. James the Great, located to the left of the sanctuary, is the traditional place where he was martyred when King Agrippas ordered him to be beheaded (Acts 12:1-2). His head is buried under the altar, marked by a piece of red marble and surrounded by six votive lamps.[11]\\r\\nThe 12th-century Historia Compostelana commissioned by bishop Diego Gelmrez provides a summary of the legend of St. James as it was believed at Compostela. Two propositions are central to it: first, that St. James preached the gospel in Iberia as well as in the Holy Land; second, that after his martyrdom at the hands of Herod Agrippa his disciples carried his body by sea to Iberia, where they landed at Padr܇n on the coast of Galicia, and took it inland for burial at Santiago de Compostela.\\r\\nThe translation of his relics from Judea to Galicia in the northwest of Iberia was effected, in legend, by a series of miraculous happenings: decapitated in Jerusalem with a sword by Herod Agrippa himself, his body was taken up by angels, and sailed in a rudderless, unattended boat to Iria Flavia in Iberia, where a massive rock closed around his relics, which were later removed to Compostela.\\r\\nAccording to ancient local tradition, on 2 January AD 40, the Virgin Mary appeared to James on the bank of the Ebro River at Caesaraugusta, while he was preaching the Gospel in Iberia. She appeared upon a pillar, Nuestra Se?ora del Pilar, and that pillar is conserved and venerated within the present Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar, in Zaragoza, Spain. Following that apparition, St. James returned to Judea, where he was beheaded by King Herod Agrippa I in the year 44.[12][13]\\r\\nThe tradition at Compostela placed the discovery of the relics of the saint in the time of king Alfonso II (791-842) and of bishop Theodemir of Iria. These traditions were the basis for the pilgrimage route that began to be established in the 9th century, and the shrine dedicated to James at Santiago de Compostela, in Galicia in Spain, became the most famous pilgrimage site in the Christian world. The Way of St. James is a trio of routes that cross Western Europe and arrive at Santiago through Northern Spain. Eventually James became the patron saint of Spain.\\r\\nJames suffered martyrdom[Acts 12:1-2] in AD 44. According to the tradition of the early Church, he had not yet left Jerusalem at this time.[14] An argument supporting this assertion is based on St Paul's Epistle to the Romans, written after AD 44, in which he expressed his intention to avoid \\"building on someone else's foundation\\"[Rom. 15:20] by visiting Spain[Rom. 15:23-24], suggesting that he knew of no previous evangelisation in Hispania.\\r\\nThe tradition was not unanimously admitted afterwards, while numerous modern scholars, following Louis Duchesne and T. E. Kendrick,[15] reject it. (According to Kendrick, even if one admits the existence of miracles, James' presence in Spain is impossible.) The Bollandists however defended it (their Acta Sanctorum, July, VI and VII, gives further sources). The suggestion began to be made from the 9th century that, as well as evangelizing in Iberia, his body may have been brought to Compostela. No earlier tradition places the burial of St. James in Hispania. A rival tradition places the relics of the apostle in the church of St. Saturnin at Toulouse; if any physical relics were ever involved, they might plausibly have been divided between the two.\\r\\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia (1908) registered several \\"difficulties\\" or bases for doubts of this tradition, beyond the late appearance of the legend:\\r\\nAlthough the tradition that James founded an apostolic see in Iberia was current in the year 700, no certain mention of such tradition is to be found in the genuine writings of early writers nor in the early councils; the first certain mention we find in the ninth century, in Notker, a monk of St. Gall (Martyrologia, 25 July), Walafrid Strabo (Poema de XII Apostoli), and others.\\r\\nThe authenticity of the relics at Compostela was asserted in the Bull of Pope Leo XIII, Omnipotens Deus, of 1 November 1884.\\r\\nAn even later tradition states that he miraculously appeared to fight for the Christian army during the legendary battle of Clavijo, and was henceforth called Santiago Matamoros (Saint James the Moor-slayer). ?Santiago, y cierra, Espa?a! (\\"St. James and strike for Spain\\") was the traditional battle cry of medieval Spanish (Christian) armies. Cervantes has Don Quixote explaining that \\"the great knight of the russet cross was given by God to Spain as patron and protector\\".[16]\\r\\nA similar miracle is related about San Milln. The possibility that a cult of James was instituted to supplant the Galician cult of Priscillian (executed in 385) who was widely venerated across the north of Iberia as a martyr at the hands of the bishops rather than as a heretic should not be overlooked. This was cautiously raised by Henry Chadwick in his book on Priscillian;[12] it is not the traditional Roman Catholic view. The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1908, however, is quite cautious about the origins of the cult (see above at \\"Controversy\\").\\r\\nJames' emblem was the scallop shell (or \\"cockle shell\\"), and pilgrims to his shrine often wore that symbol on their hats or clothes. The French for a scallop is coquille St. Jacques, which means \\"cockle (or mollusk) of St. James\\". The German word for a scallop is Jakobsmuschel, which means \\"mussel (or clam) of St. James\\"; the Dutch word is Jacobsschelp, meaning \\"shell of St. James\\".\\r\\nThe military Order of Santiago, named after James, was founded in Spain in the 12th century to fight the Moors. Later, as in other orders of chivalry, the membership became a mark of honor.\\r\\nJames had a special place in the Central African Kingdom of Kongo because of his association with the founding of Christianity in the country in the late 15th century. Portuguese sailors and diplomats brought the saint to Kongo when they first reached the country in 1483. When King Afonso I of Kongo whose Kongo name was Mvemba a Nzinga, the second Christian king, was facing a rival, his brother Mpanzu a Kitima, in battle, he reported that a vision of Saint James and the Heavenly Host appeared in the sky, frightened Mpanzu a Kitima's soldiers, and gave Afonso the victory. As a result, he declared that Saint James' feast day (25 July) be celebrated as a national holiday.\\r\\nOver the years, Saint James day became the central holiday of Kongo. Taxes were collected on that day, and men eligible for military duty were required to appear armed. There were usually regional celebrations as well as one at the capital. In some cases, Kongolese slaves carried the celebration to the New World, and there are still celebrations of Saint James Day in Haiti and Puerto Rico.\\r\\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) teaches that James has been resurrected and that in 1829 healong with the resurrected Peter and the translated Johnvisited Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and restored the priesthood authority with apostolic succession to earth.[17]","input":"Who was the first apostle to be killed?"},{"output":"12 October 1979","context":"12 October 1979 (UK)\\r\\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the first of five books in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy comedy science fiction \\"trilogy\\" by Douglas Adams.

It features the first appearance of the 42 Puzzle, designed by Adams himself, a photograph of Adams and his literary agent Ed Victor as the two space cops, and many other designs by Kevin Davies, who has participated in many Hitchhiker's related projects since the stage productions in the late 1970s. Davies himself appears as Prosser. This edition is out of print ÿ Adams bought up many remainder copies and sold them, autographed, on his website.\\r\\nThere have been three audiobook recordings of the novel. The first was an abridged edition (ISBN?0-671-62964-6), recorded in the mid-1980s by Stephen Moore, best known for playing the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android in the radio series, LP adaptations and in the TV series. In 1990, Adams himself recorded an unabridged edition for Dove Audiobooks (ISBN?1-55800-273-1), later re-released by New Millennium Audio (ISBN?1-59007-257-X) in the United States and available from BBC Audiobooks in the United Kingdom. Also by arrangement with Dove, ISIS Publishing Ltd produced a numbered exclusive edition signed by Douglas Adams (ISBN?1-85695-028-X) in 1994. To tie-in with the 2005 film, actor Stephen Fry, the film's voice of the Guide, recorded a second unabridged edition (ISBN?0-7393-2220-6).\\r\\nThe popularity of the radio series gave rise to a six-episode television series, directed and produced by Alan J. W. Bell, which first aired on BBC 2 in January and February 1981. It employed many of the actors from the radio series and was based mainly on the radio versions of Fits the First through Sixth. A second series was at one point planned, with a storyline, according to Alan Bell and Mark Wing-Davey that would have come from Adams's abandoned Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen project (instead of simply making a TV version of the second radio series). However, Adams got into disputes with the BBC (accounts differ: problems with budget, scripts, and having Alan Bell involved are all offered as causes), and the second series was never made. Elements of Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen were instead used in the third novel, Life, the Universe and Everything.\\r\\nThe main cast was the same as the original radio series, except for David Dixon as Ford Prefect instead of McGivern, and Sandra Dickinson as Trillian instead of Sheridan.\\r\\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was adapted into a science fiction comedy film directed by Garth Jennings and released on 28 April 2005 in the UK, Australia and New Zealand, and on the following day in the United States and Canada. It was rolled out to cinemas worldwide during May, June, July, August and September.\\r\\nThe deliberately misnamed Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy \\"Trilogy\\" consists of six books, five written by Adams: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1979), The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (1980), Life, the Universe and Everything (1982), So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish (1984) and Mostly Harmless (1992). On 16 September 2008 it was announced that Irish author Eoin Colfer was to pen a sixth book. The book, entitled And Another Thing..., was published in October 2009, on the 30th anniversary of the publication of the original novel.[4]\\r\\nWhen Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster was launched into space on the maiden flight of the Falcon Heavy rocket in February 2018, it had the words DON'T PANIC on the dashboard display and carried amongst other items a copy of the novel and a towel.[5][6]","input":"When was the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy first published?"},{"output":"Lieder","context":"Franz Peter Schubert (German: [?f?ant?s ??u?b?t]; 31 January 1797?ÿ 19 November 1828) was an Austrian composer.\\r\\nSchubert died at age 31, but was extremely prolific during his lifetime. His output consists of over 600 secular vocal works (mainly Lieder), seven complete symphonies, sacred music, operas, incidental music and a large body of chamber and piano music.\\r\\nAppreciation of Schubert's music while he was alive was limited to a relatively small circle of admirers in Vienna, but interest in his work increased significantly in the decades following his death. Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms and other 19th-century composers discovered and championed his works. Today, Schubert is ranked among the greatest composers of the late Classical and early Romantic eras and is one of the most frequently performed composers of the early 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSchubert was born in Himmelpfortgrund (now a part of Alsergrund), Vienna, Archduchy of Austria on 31 January 1797. His father, Franz Theodor Schubert, the son of a Moravian peasant, was a parish schoolmaster; his mother, Elisabeth (Vietz), was the daughter of a Silesian master locksmith and had been a housemaid for a Viennese family before marriage. Of Franz Theodor's fourteen children (one of them illegitimate, born in 1783),[1] nine died in infancy.\\r\\nTheir father was a well-known teacher, and his school in Lichtental (in Vienna's ninth district) had numerous students in attendance.[2] Though he was not recognised or even formally trained as a musician, he passed on certain musical basics to his gifted son.[3]\\r\\nAt the age of six, Franz began to receive regular instruction from his father, and a year later was enrolled at his father's school. His formal musical education started around the same time. His father taught him basic violin technique,[3] and his brother Ignaz gave him piano lessons.[4] Aged seven, he was given his first lessons outside the family by Michael Holzer, organist and choirmaster of the local parish church in Lichtental; the lessons may have largely consisted of conversations and expressions of admiration.[5] The boy seemed to gain more from an acquaintance with a friendly joiner's apprentice who took him to a neighbouring pianoforte warehouse where Franz could practice on better instruments.[6] He also played viola in the family string quartet, with brothers Ferdinand and Ignaz on first and second violin and his father on the cello. Franz wrote his earliest string quartets for this ensemble.[7]\\r\\nYoung Schubert first came to the attention of Antonio Salieri, then Vienna's leading musical authority, in 1804, when his vocal talent was recognized.[7] In October 1808, he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt (Imperial Seminary) through a choir scholarship. At the Stadtkonvikt, he was introduced to the overtures and symphonies of Mozart, and the symphonies of Joseph Haydn and his younger brother Michael.[8] His exposure to these and other works, combined with occasional visits to the opera, laid the foundation for a broader musical education.[9] One important musical influence came from the songs by Johann Rudolf Zumsteeg, an important Lieder composer of the time. The precocious young student \\"wanted to modernize\\" them, as reported by Joseph von Spaun, Schubert's friend.[10] Schubert's friendship with Spaun began at the Stadtkonvikt and lasted throughout his short life. In those early days, the financially well-off Spaun furnished the impoverished Schubert with much of his manuscript paper.[9]\\r\\nIn the meantime, his genius began to show in his compositions. Schubert was occasionally permitted to lead the Stadtkonvikt's orchestra, and Salieri decided to start training him privately in music theory and even in composition.[11] It was the first orchestra he wrote for, and he devoted much of the rest of his time at the Stadtkonvikt to composing chamber music, several songs, piano pieces and, more ambitiously, liturgical choral works in the form of a \\"Salve Regina\\" (D 27), a \\"Kyrie\\" (D 31), in addition to the unfinished \\"Octet for Winds\\" (D 72, said to commemorate the 1812 death of his mother),[12] the cantata Wer ist gro?? for male voices and orchestra (D 110, for his father's birthday in 1813), and his first symphony (D 82).[13]\\r\\nAt the end of 1813, he left the Stadtkonvikt and returned home for teacher training at the St Anna Normal-hauptschule. In 1814, he entered his father's school as teacher of the youngest pupils. For over two years young Schubert endured such drudgery, dragging himself through it with resounding indifference.[14] There were, however, compensatory interests even then. He continued to take private lessons in composition from Salieri, who gave Schubert more actual technical training than any of his other teachers, before they parted ways in 1817.[11]\\r\\nIn 1814, Schubert met a young soprano named Therese Grob, daughter of a local silk manufacturer, and wrote several of his liturgical works (including a \\"Salve Regina\\" and a \\"Tantum Ergo\\") for her; she was also a soloist in the premiere of his Mass No. 1 (D. 105) in September[15] 1814.[14] Schubert wanted to marry her, but was hindered by the harsh marriage-consent law of 1815[16] requiring an aspiring bridegroom to show he had the means to support a family.[17] In November 1816, after failing to gain a musical post in Laibach (now Ljubljana, Slovenia). Schubert sent Grob's brother Heinrich a collection of songs retained by the family into the twentieth century.[18]\\r\\nOne of Schubert's most prolific years was 1815. He composed over 20,000 bars of music, more than half of which was for orchestra, including nine church works (despite being agnostic[19][20]), a symphony, and about 140 Lieder.[21] In that year, he was also introduced to Anselm Httenbrenner and Franz von Schober, who would become his lifelong friends. Another friend, Johann Mayrhofer, was introduced to him by Spaun in 1814.[22]\\r\\nThe musicologist Maynard Solomon has suggested that Schubert was erotically attracted to men,[23] a thesis that has, at times, been heatedly debated.[24][25] The musicologist and Schubert expert Rita Steblin has said that he was \\"chasing women\\".[26] The theory of Schubert's homosexuality has begun to influence the interpretation of his work in scholarly papers.[27]\\r\\nSignificant changes happened in 1816. Schober, a student and of good family and some means, invited Schubert to room with him at his mother's house. The proposal was particularly opportune, for Schubert had just made the unsuccessful application for the post of kapellmeister at Laibach, and he had also decided not to resume teaching duties at his father's school. By the end of the year, he became a guest in Schober's lodgings.[citation needed] For a time, he attempted to increase the household resources by giving music lessons, but they were soon abandoned, and he devoted himself to composition. \\"I compose every morning, and when one piece is done, I begin another.\\"[28] During this year, he focused on orchestral and choral works, although he also continued to write Lieder (songs).[29] Much of this work was unpublished, but manuscripts and copies circulated among friends and admirers.[30]\\r\\nIn early 1817, Schober introduced Schubert to Johann Michael Vogl, a prominent baritone twenty years Schubert's senior. Vogl, for whom Schubert went on to write a great many songs, became one of Schubert's main proponents in Viennese musical circles. He also met Joseph Httenbrenner (brother to Anselm), who also played a role in promoting Schubert's music.[31] These, and an increasing circle of friends and musicians, became responsible for promoting, collecting, and, after his death, preserving his work.[32]\\r\\nIn late 1817, Schubert's father gained a new position at a school in Rossau, not far from Lichtental. Schubert rejoined his father and reluctantly took up teaching duties there. In early 1818, he was rejected for membership in the prestigious Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, something that might have furthered his musical career.[33] However, he began to gain more notice in the press, and the first public performance of a secular work, an overture performed in February 1818, received praise from the press in Vienna and abroad.[34]\\r\\nSchubert spent the summer of 1818 as a music teacher to the family of Count Johann Karl Esterhzy at their chateau in Zseliz (now ?eliezovce, Slovakia). The pay was relatively good, and his duties teaching piano and singing to the two daughters were relatively light, allowing him to compose happily. Schubert may have written his Marche Militaire in D major (D. 733 no. 1) for Marie and Karoline, in addition to other piano duets.[35] On his return from Zseliz, he took up residence with his friend Mayrhofer.[33]\\r\\nDuring the early 1820s, Schubert was part of a close-knit circle of artists and students who had social gatherings together that became known as Schubertiaden. The tight circle of friends with which Schubert surrounded himself was dealt a blow in early 1820. Schubert and four of his friends were arrested by the Austrian police, who (in the aftermath of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars) were on their guard against revolutionary activities and suspicious of any gathering of youth or students. One of Schubert's friends, Johann Senn, was put on trial, imprisoned for over a year, and then permanently forbidden to enter Vienna. The other four, including Schubert, were \\"severely reprimanded\\", in part for \\"inveighing against [officials] with insulting and opprobrious language\\".[36] While Schubert never saw Senn again, he did set some of his poems, Selige Welt (D. 743) and Schwanengesang (D 744), to music. The incident may have played a role in a falling-out with Mayrhofer, with whom he was living at the time.[37]\\r\\nHe was nicknamed \\"Schwammerl\\" by his friends, which Gibbs describes as translating to \\"Tubby\\" or \\"Little Mushroom\\". Schubert, at 1.52?m in height, was not quite five feet tall. \\"Schwamm\\" is Austrian (and other) dialect for mushroom; the ending \\"-erl\\" makes it a diminutive.\\r\\nThe compositions of 1819 and 1820 show a marked advance in development and maturity of style.[38] The unfinished oratorio Lazarus (D. 689) was begun in February; later followed, amid a number of smaller works, by the hymn \\"Der 23. Psalm\\" (D. 706), the octet \\"Gesang der Geister ber den Wassern\\" (D. 714), the Quartettsatz in C minor (D. 703), and the Wanderer Fantasy in C major for piano (D. 760). Of most notable interest is the staging in 1820 of two of Schubert's operas: Die Zwillingsbrder (D. 647) appeared at the Theater am K?rntnertor on 14 June, and Die Zauberharfe (D. 644) appeared at the Theater an der Wien on 21 August.[39] Hitherto, his larger compositions (apart from his masses) had been restricted to the amateur orchestra at the Gundelhof, a society which grew out of the quartet-parties at his home. Now he began to assume a more prominent position, addressing a wider public.[39] Publishers, however, remained distant, with Anton Diabelli hesitantly agreeing to print some of his works on commission.[40] The first seven opus numbers (all songs) appeared on these terms; then the commission ceased, and he began to receive penurious royalties. The situation improved somewhat in March 1821 when Vogl performed the song \\"Der Erlk?nig\\" (D. 328) at a concert that was extremely well received.[41] That month, Schubert composed a Variation on a Waltz by Diabelli (D 718), being one of the fifty composers who contributed to the Vaterl?ndischer Knstlerverein publication.\\r\\nThe production of the two operas turned Schubert's attention more firmly than ever in the direction of the stage, where, for a variety of reasons, he was almost completely unsuccessful. All in all, he embarked on twenty stage projects, each of them failures which were quickly forgotten. In 1822, Alfonso und Estrella was refused, partly owing to its libretto (written by Schubert's friend Franz von Schober.[42] Fierrabras (D 796) was rejected in the fall of 1823, but this was largely due to the popularity of Rossini and the Italian operatic style, and the failure of Carl Maria von Weber's Euryanthe.[43] Die Verschworenen (The Conspirators, D 787) was prohibited by the censor (apparently on the grounds of its title),[44] and Rosamunde, Frstin von Zypern (D 797) was withdrawn after two nights, owing to the poor quality of the play for which Schubert had written incidental music. Of these works, the first two are written on a scale which would make their performances exceedingly difficult (Fierabras, for instance, contains over 1,000 pages of manuscript score), but Die Verschworenen is a bright attractive comedy, and Rosamunde contains some of the most charming music that Schubert ever composed. In 1822, he made the acquaintance with both Weber and Beethoven, but little came of it in either case. Beethoven is said to have acknowledged the younger man's gifts on a few occasions, but some of this is likely legend and in any case he could not have known the real scope of Schubert's music, especially not the instrumental works, as so little of it was printed or performed in the composer's lifetime. On his deathbed, Beethoven is said to have looked into some of the younger man's works and exclaimed: \\"Truly, the spark of divine genius resides in this Schubert!\\",[45] but what would have come of it, if he had recovered, we can never know.\\r\\nDespite his preoccupation with the stage, and later with his official duties, Schubert found time during these years for a significant amount of composition. He completed the Mass in A-flat major (D. 678) and, in 1822, embarked suddenly on a work which more decisively than almost any other in those years showed his maturing personal vision, the Symphony in B minor Unfinished (D. 759). The reason he left it unfinishedafter two movements and sketches some way into a thirdremains an enigma, and it is also remarkable that he did not mention it to any of his friends, even though, as Brian Newbould notes, he must have felt thrilled by what he was achieving. The event has been debated endlessly without resolution.\\r\\nIn 1823 Schubert, in addition to Fierrabras, also wrote his first large-scale song cycle, Die sch?ne Mllerin (D. 795), setting poems by Wilhelm Mller.[46] This series, together with the later cycle Winterreise (D. 911, also setting texts of Mller in 1827) is widely considered one of the pinnacles of Lieder.[47] He also composed the song Du bist die Ruh' (You are rest and peace,[48] D. 776) during this year. Also in that year, symptoms of syphilis first appeared.[49]\\r\\nIn 1824, he wrote the Variations in E minor for flute and piano Trockne Blumen, a song from the cycle Die sch?ne Mllerin, and several string quartets. He also wrote the Sonata in A minor for arpeggione and piano (D. 821) at the time when there was a minor craze over that instrument.[50] In the spring of that year, he wrote the Octet in F major (D. 803), a sketch for a 'Grand Symphony'; and in the summer went back to Zseliz. There he became attracted to Hungarian musical idiom, and wrote the Divertissement  la hongroise in G minor for piano duet (D. 818) and the String Quartet in A minor Rosamunde (D. 804). It has been said that he held a hopeless passion for his pupil, the Countess Karoline Esterhzy, but the only work he dedicated to her was his Fantasia in F minor for piano duet (D. 940).[51] His friend Eduard von Bauernfeld penned the following verse, which appears to reference Schubert's unrequited sentiments:\\r\\nIn love with a Countess of youthful grace,\\r\\nA pupil of Galt's; in desperate case\\r\\nYoung Schubert surrenders himself to another,\\r\\nAnd fain would avoid such affectionate pother[52]\\r\\nThe setbacks of previous years were compensated by the prosperity and happiness of 1825. Publication had been moving more rapidly, the stress of poverty was for a time lightened, and in the summer he had a pleasant holiday in Upper Austria where he was welcomed with enthusiasm. It was during this tour that he produced the seven-song cycle Fr?ulein am See, based on Walter Scott's Lady of the Lake, and including \\"Ellens Gesang III\\" (\\"Hymn to the Virgin\\") (D. 839, Op. 52, No. 6); the lyrics of Adam Storck's German translation of the Scott poem are now frequently substituted by the full text of the traditional Roman Catholic prayer Hail Mary (Ave Maria in Latin)for which the Schubert melody is not an original setting, as it is widely, though mistakenly, thought. The original only opens with the greeting \\"Ave Maria\\", which also recurs only in the refrain.[53] In 1825, Schubert also wrote the Piano Sonata in A minor (D 845, first published as op. 42), and began the Symphony in C major (Great C major, D. 944), which was completed the following year.[54]\\r\\nFrom 1826 to 1828, Schubert resided continuously in Vienna, except for a brief visit to Graz in 1827. The history of his life during these three years was comparatively uninteresting, and is little more than a record of his compositions. In 1826, he dedicated a symphony (D. 944, that later came to be known as the Great C major) to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde and received an honorarium in return.[55] In the spring of 1828, he gave, for the only time in his career, a public concert of his own works, which was very well received.[56] The compositions themselves are a sufficient biography. The String Quartet No. 14 in D minor (D. 810), with the variations on Death and the Maiden, was written during the winter of 1825ÿ1826, and first played on 25 January 1826. Later in the year came the String Quartet No. 15 in G major, (D 887, first published as op. 161), the Rondo in B minor for violin and piano (D. 895), Rondeau brillant, and the Piano Sonata in G major, (D 894, first published as Fantasie in G, op. 78). To these should be added the three Shakespearian songs, of which \\"St?ndchen\\" (D. 889) and \\"An Sylvia\\" (D. 891) were allegedly written on the same day, the former at a tavern where he broke his afternoon's walk, the latter on his return to his lodging in the evening.[57]\\r\\nIn 1827, Schubert wrote the song cycle Winterreise (D. 911), a colossal peak in art song (\\"remarkable\\" was the way it was described at the Schubertiades), the Fantasy in C major for violin and piano (D. 934, first published as op. post. 159), the Impromptus for piano, and the two piano trios (the first in B-flat major (D. 898), and the second in E-flat major, (D. 929);[58] in 1828 the cantata Mirjams Siegesgesang (Victory Song of Miriam, D 942) on a text by Franz Grillparzer, the Mass in E-flat major (D. 950), the Tantum Ergo (D. 962) in the same key, the String Quintet in C major (D. 956), the second \\"Benedictus\\" to the Mass in C major (D. 452), the three final piano sonatas (D. 958, D. 959, and D. 960), and the song cycle 13 Lieder nach Gedichten von Rellstab und Heine for voice and piano, also known as Schwanengesang (Swan-song, D. 957).[59] This collection, while not a true song cycle, retains a unity amongst the individual songs, touching depths of tragedy and of the morbidly supernatural, which had rarely been plumbed by any composer in the century preceding it. Six of these are set to words by Heinrich Heine, whose Buch der Lieder appeared in the autumn. The Symphony in C major (D. 944) is dated 1828, but Schubert scholars believe that this symphony was largely written in 1825ÿ1826 (being referred to while he was on holiday at Gastein in 1825that work, once considered lost, is now generally seen as an early stage of his C major symphony) and was revised for prospective performance in 1828. This was a fairly unusual practice for Schubert, for whom publication, let alone performance, was rarely contemplated for most of his larger-scale works during his lifetime. The huge, Beethovenian work was declared \\"unplayable\\" by a Viennese orchestra.[60] In the last weeks of his life, he began to sketch three movements for a new Symphony in D major (D 936A).[61]\\r\\nThe works of his last two years reveal a composer increasingly meditating on the darker side of the human psyche and human relationships, and with a deeper sense of spiritual awareness and conception of the 'beyond'. He reaches extraordinary depths in several chillingly dark songs of this period, especially in the larger cycles. For example, the song \\"Der Doppelg?nger\\" (D 957, No. 13, \\"The double\\") reaching an extraordinary climax, conveying madness at the realization of rejection and imminent death ÿ a stark and visionary picture in sound and words that had been prefigured a year before by \\"Der Leiermann\\" (D 911, No. 24, \\"The Hurdy-Gurdy Man\\") at the end of Winterreise ÿ and yet the composer is able to touch repose and communion with the infinite in the almost timeless ebb and flow of the string quintet and his last three piano sonatas, moving between joyful, vibrant poetry and remote introspection. Even in large-scale works he was sometimes using increasingly sparse textures; Newbould cites his writing in the fragmentary Symphony in D major (D 936A), probably the work of his very last two months. In this work, he anticipates Mahler's use of folksong-like harmonics and bare soundscapes.[62] Schubert expressed the wish, were he to survive his final illness, to further develop his knowledge of harmony and counterpoint, and had actually made appointments for lessons with the counterpoint master Simon Sechter.[63]\\r\\nIn the midst of this creative activity, his health deteriorated. The cause of his death was officially diagnosed as typhoid fever, though other theories have been proposed, including the tertiary stage of syphilis.[64] By the late 1820s, Schubert's health was failing and he confided to some friends that he feared that he was near death.[65][page?needed] In the late summer of 1828, the composer saw court physician Ernst Rinna, who may have confirmed Schubert's suspicions that he was ill beyond cure and likely to die soon.[66][page?needed] Some of his symptoms matched those of mercury poisoning (mercury was then a common treatment for syphilis, again suggesting that Schubert suffered from it).[67] At the beginning of November, he again fell ill, experiencing headaches, fever, swollen joints, and vomiting. He was generally unable to retain solid food and his condition worsened. Schubert died in Vienna, aged 31, on 19 November 1828, at the apartment of his brother Ferdinand. The last musical work he had wished to hear was Beethoven's String Quartet No. 14 in C-sharp minor, Op. 131; his friend, violinist Karl Holz, who was present at the gathering, five days before Schubert's death, commented: \\"The King of Harmony has sent the King of Song a friendly bidding to the crossing\\".[68] It was next to Beethoven, whom he had admired all his life, that Schubert was buried by his own request, in the village cemetery of W?hring, Vienna.[69] He had served as a torchbearer at Beethoven's funeral a year before his own death.\\r\\nIn 1872, a memorial to Franz Schubert was erected in Vienna's Stadtpark.[69] In 1888, both Schubert's and Beethoven's graves were moved to the Zentralfriedhof where they can now be found next to those of Johann Strauss II and Johannes Brahms.[70] The cemetery in W?hring was converted into a park in 1925, called the Schubert Park, and his former grave site was marked by a bust.\\r\\nSchubert was remarkably prolific, writing over 1,500 works in his short career. His compositional style progressed rapidly throughout his short life.[71] The largest number of his compositions are songs for solo voice and piano (over 600). He also composed a considerable number of secular works for two or more voices, namely part songs, choruses and cantatas. He completed eight orchestral overtures and seven complete symphonies, in addition to fragments of six others. While he composed no concertos, he did write three concertante works for violin and orchestra. There is a large body of music for solo piano, including fourteen complete sonatas, numerous miscellaneous works and many short dances. There is also a relatively large set of works for piano duet. There are over fifty chamber works, including some fragmentary works. His sacred output includes seven masses, one oratorio and one requiem, among other mass movements and numerous smaller compositions.[72] He completed only eleven of his twenty-stage works.[73]\\r\\nIn July 1947 the Austrian composer Ernst Krenek discussed Schubert's style, abashedly admitting that he had at first \\"shared the wide-spread opinion that Schubert was a lucky inventor of pleasing tunes ... lacking the dramatic power and searching intelligence which distinguished such 'real' masters as J.S. Bach or Beethoven\\". Krenek wrote that he reached a completely different assessment after close study of Schubert's pieces at the urging of friend and fellow composer Eduard Erdmann. Krenek pointed to the piano sonatas as giving \\"ample evidence that [Schubert] was much more than an easy-going tune-smith who did not know, and did not care, about the craft of composition.\\" Each sonata then in print, according to Krenek, exhibited \\"a great wealth of technical finesse\\" and revealed Schubert as \\"far from satisfied with pouring his charming ideas into conventional molds; on the contrary he was a thinking artist with a keen appetite for experimentation.\\"[74]\\r\\nThat \\"appetite for experimentation\\" manifests itself repeatedly in Schubert's output in a wide variety of forms and genres, including opera, liturgical music, chamber and solo piano music, and symphonic works. Perhaps most familiarly, his adventurousness manifests itself as a notably original sense of modulation, as in the second movement of the String Quintet (D. 956) where he modulates from E major through F minor, to reach the tonic key of E major.[75] It also appears in unusual choices of instrumentation, as in the Sonata in A minor for arpeggione and piano (D. 821), or the unconventional scoring of the Trout Quintet (D. 667).\\r\\nWhile he was clearly influenced by the Classical sonata forms of Beethoven and Mozart (his early works, among them notably the 5th Symphony, are particularly Mozartean), his formal structures and his developments tend to give the impression more of melodic development than of harmonic drama.[76] This combination of Classical form and long-breathed Romantic melody sometimes lends them a discursive style: his Great C major Symphony was described by Robert Schumann as running to \\"heavenly lengths\\".[77] His harmonic innovations include movements in which the first section ends in the key of the subdominant rather than the dominant (as in the last movement of the Trout Quintet). Schubert's practice here was a forerunner of the common Romantic technique of relaxing, rather than raising, tension in the middle of a movement, with final resolution postponed to the very end.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt was in the genre of the Lied, however, that Schubert made his most indelible mark. Leon Plantinga remarks, \\"In his more than six hundred Lieder he explored and expanded the potentialities of the genre, as no composer before him.\\"[78] Prior to Schubert's influence, Lieder tended toward a strophic, syllabic treatment of text, evoking the folksong qualities engendered by the stirrings of Romantic nationalism.[79]\\r\\nAmong Schubert's treatments of the poetry of Goethe, his settings of \\"Gretchen am Spinnrade\\" (D. 118) and \\"Der Erlk?nig\\" (D. 328) are particularly striking for their dramatic content, forward-looking uses of harmony, and their use of eloquent pictorial keyboard figurations, such as the depiction of the spinning wheel and treadle in the piano in \\"Gretchen\\" and the furious and ceaseless gallop in \\"Erlk?nig\\".[80] He composed music using the poems of a myriad of poets, with Goethe, Mayrhofer and Schiller being the top three most frequent, and others like Heinrich Heine, Friedrich Rckert and Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff among many others. Also of particular note are his two song cycles on the poems of Wilhelm Mller, Die sch?ne Mllerin and Winterreise, which helped to establish the genre and its potential for musical, poetic, and almost operatic dramatic narrative. His last song cycle published in 1828 after his death, Schwanengesang, is also an innovative contribution to German lieder literature, as it features poems by different poets, namely Ludwig Rellstab, Heine, and Johann Gabriel Seidl. The Wiener Theaterzeitung, writing about Winterreise at the time, commented that it was a work that \\"none can sing or hear without being deeply moved\\".[81]\\r\\nAntonn Dvo?k wrote in 1894 that Schubert, whom he considered one of the truly great composers, was clearly influential on shorter works, especially Lieder and shorter piano works: \\"The tendency of the romantic school has been toward short forms, and although Weber helped to show the way, to Schubert belongs the chief credit of originating the short models of piano forte pieces which the romantic school has preferably cultivated. [...] Schubert created a new epoch with the Lied. [...] All other songwriters have followed in his footsteps.\\"[82]\\r\\nWhen Schubert died he had around 100 opus numbers published, mainly songs, chamber music and smaller piano compositions.[83] Publication of smaller pieces continued (including opus numbers up to 173 in 1860s, 50 instalments with songs published by Diabelli and dozens of first publications Peters),[84] but the manuscripts of many of the longer works, whose existence was not widely known, remained hidden in cabinets and file boxes of Schubert's family, friends, and publishers.[85] Even some of Schubert's friends were unaware of the full scope of what he wrote, and for many years he was primarily recognized as the \\"prince of song\\", although there was recognition of some of his larger-scale efforts.[86] In 1838 Robert Schumann, on a visit to Vienna, found the dusty manuscript of the C major Symphony (D. 944) and took it back to Leipzig where it was performed by Felix Mendelssohn and celebrated in the Neue Zeitschrift. An important step towards the recovery of the neglected works was the journey to Vienna which Sir George Grove (widely known for the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians) and Arthur Sullivan made in the autumn of 1867. The travellers rescued from oblivion seven symphonies, the Rosamunde incidental music, some of the masses and operas, several chamber works, and a vast quantity of miscellaneous pieces and songs.[85] This led to more widespread public interest in Schubert's work.[87]\\r\\nFrom 1884 to 1897, Breitkopf & H?rtel published Franz Schubert's Works, a critical edition including a contribution made ÿ among others ÿ by Johannes Brahms, editor of the first series containing eight symphonies. The publication of the Neue Schubert-Ausgabe by B?renreiter started in the second half of the 20th century.\\r\\nSince relatively few of Schubert's works were published in his lifetime, only a small number of them have opus numbers assigned, and even in those cases, the sequence of the numbers does not give a good indication of the order of composition. Austrian musicologist Otto Erich Deutsch (1883ÿ1967) is known for compiling the first comprehensive catalogue of Schubert's works. This was first published in English in 1951 (Schubert Thematic Catalogue) and subsequently revised for a new edition in German in 1978 (Franz Schubert: Thematisches Verzeichnis seiner Werke in chronologischer Folge ÿ Franz Schubert: Thematic Catalogue of his Works in Chronological Order).\\r\\nConfusion arose quite early over the numbering of Schubert's late symphonies. Schubert's last completed symphony, the Great C major D?944, was assigned the numbers 7, 8, 9 and 10, depending on publication. Similarly the Unfinished D?759 has been indicated with the numbers 7, 8, and 9.[88]\\r\\nThe order usually followed for these late symphonies by English-language sources is:\\r\\nAn even broader confusion arose over the numbering of the piano sonatas, with numbering systems ranging from 15 to 23 sonatas, although numbers are used far more often for the symphonies than for the piano sonatas of Schubert.\\r\\nA feeling of regret for the loss of potential masterpieces caused by his early death at age 31 was expressed in the epitaph on his large tombstone written by his friend the poet Franz Grillparzer: \\"Here music has buried a treasure, but even fairer hopes.\\"[89] Some have disagreed with this early view, arguing that Schubert in his lifetime did produce enough masterpieces not to be limited to the image of an unfulfilled promise. This is in particular the opinion of pianists, including Alfred Brendel, who dryly billed the Grillparzer epitaph as \\"inappropriate\\".\\r\\nSchubert's chamber music continues to be popular. In a poll, the results of which were announced in October 2008, the ABC in Australia found that Schubert's chamber works dominated the field, with the Trout Quintet coming first, followed by two of his other works.[90]\\r\\nThe New York Times music critic Anthony Tommasini, who ranked Schubert as the fourth greatest composer, wrote of him:\\r\\nYou have to love the guy, who died at 31, ill, impoverished and neglected except by a circle of friends who were in awe of his genius. For his hundreds of songs alone ÿ including the haunting cycle Winterreise, which will never release its tenacious hold on singers and audiences ÿ Schubert is central to our concert life.... Schubert's first few symphonies may be works in progress. But the Unfinished and especially the Great C major Symphony are astonishing. The latter one paves the way for Bruckner and prefigures Mahler.[91]\\r\\nFrom the 1830s through the 1870s, Franz Liszt transcribed and arranged a number of Schubert's works, particularly the songs. Liszt, who was a significant force in spreading Schubert's work after his death, said Schubert was \\"the most poetic musician who ever lived.\\"[92] Schubert's symphonies were of particular interest to Antonn Dvo?k, with Hector Berlioz and Anton Bruckner acknowledging the influence of the Great C major Symphony.[93] It was Robert Schumann who, having seen the manuscript of the 'Great' C Major Symphony in Vienna in 1838, drew it to the attention of Mendelssohn, who gave[94] the first performance of it in Leipzig in 1839. In the 20th century, composers such as Anton Webern, Benjamin Britten, Richard Strauss, George Crumb and Hans Zender either championed or paid homage to Schubert in their work. Britten, an accomplished pianist, accompanied many of Schubert's Lieder and performed many piano solo and duet works.[93]\\r\\nIn 1977, the German electronic band Kraftwerk recorded an instrumental tribute song called \\"Franz Schubert\\" on their album Trans-Europe Express.[95]\\r\\nIn 1897, the 100th anniversary of Schubert's birth was marked in the musical world by festivals and performances dedicated to his music. In Vienna, there were ten days of concerts, and the Emperor Franz Joseph gave a speech recognizing Schubert as the creator of the art song, and one of Austria's favorite sons.[96][97] Karlsruhe saw the first production of his opera Fierabras.[98]\\r\\nIn 1928, Schubert week was held in Europe and the United States to mark the centenary of the composer's death. Works by Schubert were performed in churches, in concert halls, and on radio stations. A competition, with top prize money of $10,000 and sponsorship by the Columbia Phonograph Company, was held for \\"original symphonic works presented as an apotheosis of the lyrical genius of Schubert, and dedicated to his memory\\".[99] The winning entry was Kurt Atterberg's sixth symphony.[99]\\r\\nSchubert has featured as a character in a number of films including Schubert's Dream of Spring (1931), Gently My Songs Entreat (1933), Serenade (1940), The Great Awakening (1941), It's Only Love (1947), Franz Schubert (1953), Das Dreim?derlhaus (1958), and Notturno (1986).\\r\\nSchubert's music has been featured in numerous films since the silent era, some of which are listed here.\\r\\nEmeric Pressburger\\r\\nGerman Dance No. 1 in C major?[109]\\r\\nOp. 164, D. 537?[112]\\r\\nThe following citations illustrate the confusion around the numbering of Schubert's late symphonies. The B minor Unfinished Symphony is variously published as No. 7 and No. 8, in both German and English. All of these editions appeared to be in print (or at least somewhat readily available) in 2008.\\r\\nOtto Erich Deutsch, working in the first half of the 20th century, was probably the preeminent scholar of Schubert's life and music. In addition to the catalogue of Schubert's works, he collected and organized a great deal of material about Schubert, some of which is still in print.\\r\\nAdditional sources:\\r\\nList of compositions by Franz Schubert","input":"What type of song did schubert specialize in?"},{"output":"a fictional character created by author Tom Clancy","context":"Dr. John Patrick \\"Jack\\" Ryan Sr., KCVO (Hon.), Ph.D. is a fictional character created by author Tom Clancy who appears in many of his novels and their respective film adaptations.\\r\\nJack Ryan was born in Baltimore in 1950 and grew up there, son of a city police detective and a nurse, and attended at Loyola. He earned an NROTC commission in the U.S. Marines at Boston College. Medically discharged at the rank of 2nd Lieutenant following a helicopter crash in Greece, he worked as an investment broker briefly and made a fortune. He met and married Caroline \\"Cathy\\" Mueller, a medical student and later an ophthalmic/eye surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital, with whom he had four children. He returned to academia, eventually accepting a position as a history professor at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis.\\r\\nHe was later recommended to the CIA, eventually spending a short period there writing a position paper, as well as developing a counter-espionage mechanism. He returned to the Academy and, while on a history research trip to London, interrupted a kidnapping attempt on the royal family. After his return to the States, he eventually accepted a position with the CIA as a protege of Admiral Jim Greer, deputy director. He rose rapidly through the ranks in a variety of covert operations against the USSR, eventually becoming a Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. As DDI, he fought numerous political battles that eventually led to him becoming briefly first National Security Advisor, followed by a short period as Vice President, before then suddenly President of the United States after a terrorist plane crashing into the U S. Capitol, serving two terms and dealing with international crises in Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRyan had his background established in Patriot Games and Red Rabbit. He was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1950, the son of Emmet William Ryan (1922ÿ1974), a Baltimore City Police Department homicide lieutenant, and World War II veteran. The elder Ryan had served with the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division at the Battle of the Bulge in western Europe. His mother, Catherine Burke Ryan (1923ÿ1974), was a nurse. Without Remorse mentioned that he had a sister, who lived in Seattle.\\r\\nAfter graduating from Loyola High School (now Loyola Blakefield), a Roman Catholic Jesuit prep school in Towson, Maryland in suburban Baltimore County, Ryan attended Boston College, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics (with a strong minor in history) and a commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps (via Officer Candidate School). While waiting for the Corps to assign him, he passed the Certified Public Accountant exam.[2]\\r\\nAfter officer training at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Quantico, Virginia, he went on to serve briefly as a Marine infantry Platoon leader. However, his military career was cut short at the age of 23 when his platoon's helicopter, a CH-46 Sea Knight, crashed during a North Atlantic Treaty Organization exercise over the Greek island of Crete. The crash badly injured Ryan's back. U.S. Navy surgeons, at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, inadequately repaired his back. This led to a lengthy recovery process (during which he nearly became addicted to pain medications) after which, complete with a permanent disability and wearing a back brace, he left the Marines. He passed his stockbroker's exam and took a position with Wall Street investment firm Merrill Lynch's Baltimore office.\\r\\nHis parents died in a plane crash at Chicago Midway International Airport, 19 months after his crash in Crete. He developed a fear of flying that persisted for years.\\r\\nThe film version of The Hunt for Red October changed his education background to being a 1972 graduate of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, 20 miles south of Baltimore in the state capital.\\r\\nRyan's story starts in Patriot Games and continues in Red Rabbit. While managing clients' portfolios, he began to invest his own money, banking on a tip he had received from an uncle about the workers' takeover of the Chicago and North Western Railway, making about $6 million off his $100,000 initial investment. He did so well that one of Merrill Lynch's senior vice presidents, Joe Muller, came to Baltimore to have dinner with him, with the objective of inviting him to the firm's New York City headquarters near Wall Street. Also present is Muller's daughter Caroline, nicknamed Cathy, then a senior medical student at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. They immediately fall in love and get engaged. One night, while having dinner with his fiance, Ryan throws out his back. Cathy takes him directly to Dr. Stanley Rabinowitz, professor of neurosurgery at famed Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, to be evaluated. Rabinowitz later operates on Ryan's back and cures his chronic pain in relatively short order (in a later novel, the surgeon is credited as Sam Rosen, a doctor introduced in Without Remorse). Ryan subsequently persuades the government to terminate his disability checks. Cathy later becomes an ophthalmic surgeon at the Wilmer Eye Institute of The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a Professor of Surgery at Johns Hopkins.\\r\\nAfter creating a net worth of $8 million, Ryan left the firm after four years and enrolled at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. for six doctoral courses in history. He does a brief stint at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, then accepts a position at the U.S. Naval Academy as a civilian professor of history.\\r\\nFollowing a recommendation from Father Tim O'Riley, a Jesuit priest and professor at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., to a Central Intelligence Agency contact, Ryan was asked to work as a consultant for the agency, although officially employed by the MITRE Corporation. He agreed and spent several months at agency headquarters in Langley, Virginia, where he wrote a paper entitled \\"Agents and Agencies\\", in which he maintained that state-sponsored terrorism is an act of war. He also invented the canary trap, a method for exposing an information leak, which involves giving different versions of a sensitive document to each of a group of suspects and seeing which version is leaked. By ensuring that each copy of the document differs slightly in its wording, if any copy is leaked, then it is possible to determine the informant's identity.\\r\\nThese accomplishments come to the attention of U.S. Navy Vice Admiral James Greer, the CIA's Deputy Director for Intelligence. The expertise of Ryan's report, plus the application, persuaded Greer to offer him a permanent job in the CIA, but Ryan declined.\\r\\nWhile Ryan was still teaching at the Naval Academy, his family (wife and new daughter Sally) and he take a trip to London for research and vacationing. After spending the day sifting through Royal Navy archives doing research for a book on the British naval war in the Indian Ocean during World War II, Ryan walks to meet his family at a park. As he joins them, members of the Ulster Liberation Army (ULA), an ultraviolent Maoist offshoot of the Marxist Provisional Irish Republican Army, led by Kevin O'Donnell, coincidentally attack a passing car containing the heir to the British throne, the Prince of Wales and his family in front of the Ryans. Ryan is wounded while intervening in the attack and foils their plan, killing one of the gunmen and capturing another. Ryan is later knighted by Queen Elizabeth II as an honorary Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order; in the books, some British characters call him \\"Sir John\\", but honorary knights are not permitted to use the style of \\"Sir\\", but his American colleagues and friends delight in teasing him so.[3]\\r\\nSean Miller, the Irish gunman he captured, vows revenge on Ryan and his family (only in the movie, not the book), but since he is going to Albany Prison on the Isle of Wight, the threat seems unrealistic. Ryan returns to the U.S. and the Naval Academy. When later O'Donnell and the ULA liberate Miller on his way to prison in a paddy wagon (killing both police officers and civilians in the process), the Ryans become the target of their revenge  particularly Miller's. A few months later after some additional training in a Libyan desert terrorist base when his gang of Irish extremist thugs show up at the Ryan family home at Peregrine Cliff facing Chesapeake Bay and put Jack, his family and best friend Robbie Jackson through a harrowing experience.\\r\\nIn Patriot Games, Greer comes to Ryan and asks him to rejoin the CIA permanently as an analyst to help track down the terrorists. He declines initially, only to accept it after a failed ULA attack on the Ryans mildly wounds his pregnant wife, but severely injures his daughter outside her school. Later, while Ryan hosts the Prince and Princess of Wales at his waterfront home on Chesapeake Bay, south of Annapolis in Maryland, the IRA conducts another attack against him, which Ryan, the Prince, and close friend, Navy Commander Robert Jackson foil. Following the incident and arrests of the ULA members and Miller (whom Ryan nearly executes with his Browning Hi Power), Ryan is taken to the Naval Academy hospital, where he arrives just in time for the birth of Jack Ryan Jr., his second child.\\r\\nIn Red Rabbit, Ryan's first CIA assignment is to London as a member of a liaison group to the British Secret Intelligence Service. The first order of business focuses on a mission to assist the defection of a KGB communications-center officer who has discovered that longtime KGB director Yuri Andropov (1914-1984, head of KGB 1967-82, later General Secretary of USSR 1982-1984), had ordered Pope John Paul II's attempted assassination. Although Ryan and a small team of British agents helps the \\"Rabbit\\" and his family get to the West, they fail to prevent the attack on the Pope (which actually happened in real life in 1981). Nevertheless, the Pope is only wounded and his would-be assassin captured, while the British agents execute his Bulgarian handler. \\"Rabbit's\\" defection proves to be a major coup for both the American and British intelligence agencies. Ryan soon afterward suggests a nonmilitary long-term strategy to help hasten the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the half-century long Cold War.\\r\\nIn The Hunt for Red October, Captain First Rank Marko Ramius, the Soviet Navy's top submarine commander, takes command of the 椰ֳ ɰђ^ (Krasny Oktyabr, or in English, Red October), the newest Typhoon-class ballistic missile submarine, with which he plans to defect with his officers. Having briefly met Captain Ramius at an embassy function several years before, Ryan is asked by Admiral Greer to brief the President's National Security Adviser Jeffrey Pelt and his staff in his first trip to the White House on Ramius' background and the deadly new capabilities of Red October's' secret revolutionary silent jet propulsion drive system. Ryan recognizes that the renegade ethnic Lithuanian captain may want to change sides rather than attack the West and works to establish contact with him at sea while onboard the tailing American submarine USS Dallas and work to get him and his sub secretly to the U.S., eventually succeeding.\\r\\nIn The Cardinal of the Kremlin, Ryan is reassigned to Langley, at CIA headquarters. He becomes Greer's assistant with the official title of Special Assistant to the Deputy Director for Intelligence. Greer is grooming him for bigger and better positions, maybe even his own job when the veteran spy finally retires. Ryan is sent to Moscow as part of the American strategic nuclear weapons reduction (START) negotiations team. There, he meets Sergey Golovko, a rising star in the KGB hierarchy, and becomes entangled in a complex web related to both the race to develop \\"Star Wars\\" space-based laser anti-missile defensive technology and engineer another defection, this time compromising the KGB director to save the CIA's highest informant in the USSR, Agent \\"CARDINAL\\", better known as Colonel Misha Filitov. Although they initially meet as adversariesat one time literally at gunpointGolovko respects him as a worthy adversary and in later books befriends him, calling him \\"Ivan Emmetovich\\", giving him a Russian-style patronymic based on his father's name, Emmet.\\r\\nIn Clear and Present Danger, Ryan is promoted to acting DDI when Greer is hospitalized with cancer. Despite this, he is not made aware of a highly covert and illegal CIA operation encouraged by the President claiming domestic drug abuse was a \\"clear and present danger\\" to American security, and approved by corrupt National Security Advisor Admiral Cutter. This operation targets Colombian drug lords in South America using military assets of small mobile heavily armed special forces squads and occasional precision air strikes with sophisticated \\"smartbombs\\", in what is usually considered a law enforcement area. Ryan works with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to rescue a small group of American soldiers cut off in Colombia, forcing him to miss Greer's funeral. Also in this operation, he first met the U.S. government operative John Clark, with whom he would become friends. Around this time, Ryan also runs afoul of Elizabeth Elliott, international affairs advisor to then-presidential candidate Governor of Ohio J. Robert Fowler, and one of Cathy Ryan's former professors.\\r\\nIn The Sum of All Fears, Ryan reaches his highest post at the CIA, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. His career is jeopardized when Fowler becomes President and Elizabeth Elliott, Fowler's lover/manipulator, becomes National Security Advisor. They not only deny Ryan any credit for an innovative Middle East peace plan (basically turning Jerusalem into a Vatican-like city co-ruled by three Christian, Jewish, and Arab/Muslim mayors), but also panic when Iranian and former East German terrorists detonate a nuclear bomb in Denver during the Super Bowl and nearly plunge the world into a Soviet-American nuclear war. Ryan defuses the nuclear crisis by commandeering the Washington-Moscow hot line and convincing the Soviet Premier (through his friend Golovko) that the crisis is a setup. He then refuses to confirm Fowler's order to launch a nuclear missile at Qom (thus preventing the attack), where the Iranian ayatollah lives. The crisis and Elliot scandal drive Fowler to resign, and on this note, Ryan retires from the CIA after his CIA friends and he flies to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia and witness the execution of the terrorists, then being honored by the U.S.'s Middle Eastern allies. (The film version again departs from the printed / novel version, by presenting a younger, unmarried Ryan, an intelligent mistress-free Fowler, a Greer-like Cabot, and the nuclear bomb is detonated over Baltimore, not Denver.)\\r\\nIn Debt of Honor, Ryan returns to government service as the National Security Advisor, restoring honor to the job that Cutter and Elliot disgraced. It has been two and a half years since Fowler resigned and his vice president, Roger Durling, is now well into his own term. Jack and the administration must deal with a second war between the U.S. and Japan, as well as an attack on America's economic infrastructure. After a clean sweep of Japan's forces in the South Pacific, Vice President Ed Kealty is forced to resign after a sex scandal and President Durling taps Ryan for the job. Ryan accepts the job on the condition that he will only serve until the end of Durling's term. He sees this as a way of ending his public life. Only minutes after Congress confirms Ryan, though, a Japanese airline pilot deliberately crashes a 747 into the U.S. Capitol building during Congress' joint session, killing most of the people inside, decapitating the U.S. government, and elevating Ryan to the Presidency.\\r\\nThe reluctant yet determined Ryan administration emerges in Executive Orders as Ryan slowly rebuilds the government. He is faced with Kealty's political trickery, China's growing military antagonizing of Taiwan, and a deadly plague initiated by the newly formed United Islamic Republic, resulting in two major military conflicts far from American shores (but one will not take place until the next Ryan novel).\\r\\nIn The Bear and the Dragon, Ryan has completed Durling's term as President and has campaigned forand wonthe next election. He retains most of his emergency Cabinet and has Robby Jackson as Vice President.\\r\\nRyan has to deal with the attempted assassination of Golovko, head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (formerly the KGB). This turns out to be an attempt to sow confusion in the Russian government because of China's designs to annex Eastern Siberia, where geologists had recently discovered a large amount of oil and gold. These events lead to the inclusion of Russia into NATO and the assistance of U.S. forces in the Sino-Russian conflict (although attacks on NATO members outside the Atlantic should not trigger Article V). When the Chinese begin losing the war, U.S. forces target their strategic assets. A U.S. submarine sinks a Chinese ballistic missile submarine, causing China's politburo to panic and increase the readiness of their 12 land-based ICBMs. U.S. forces do not have the ability to destroy the silos, as they could only use deep-penetrating bombs, which had all been used to destroy Chinese bridges to disrupt the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) logistical support. This causes the U.S. and Russia to send a joint RAINBOW-Spetsnaz team to destroy the silos. They destroy 11 of the 12 ICBMs, but one of them manages to launch. The warhead heads towards Washington, DC, and with Ryan taking a command initiative at an Aegis missile cruiser, the ICBM is intercepted by ABMs from the USS?Gettysburg. With the PLA's looming defeat in Siberia, which they were about to learn about via live UAV broadcasts from the CIA through the Internet, student demonstrators in Beijing raid the politburo, causing a reformist politburo member, Fang Gan, to take control and arrest the war's perpetrators, making peace negotiations with the U.S. and Russia, and beginning China's transition to democracy.\\r\\nAt the end of Executive Orders, Ryan, in the tradition of Presidents Monroe, Truman, Carter and Reagan, issues a foreign policy doctrine which largely defines his administration's international perspective. The Ryan doctrine states that the U.S. will no longer tolerate attacks on \\"our territory, our possessions, or our citizens,\\" and will hold whoever orders such attacks accountable.[4]\\r\\nThis statement comes soon after the Ebola attack on the U.S. ordered by Mahmoud Haji Daryaei, the dictator of the new United Islamic Republic. Ryan announces the new doctrine on television, momentarily cutting away to show Daryaei and his UIR advisors being incinerated by laser-guided bombs launched from two F-117s, on Ryan's orders. Therefore, the Ryan doctrine supersedes the executive order put in place by President Ford, which forbids the assassination of foreign heads of state. Ryan, however, believes it is a more ethical alternative than total war, since it punishes the person responsible for the attack instead of the people he rules.\\r\\nWithin the books, the Ryan doctrine is not officially invoked after Daryaei's death (although Ryan threatens to use it on the Chinese leadership in The Bear and the Dragon, should anything happen to American citizens living in China as a consequence of the Siberian War).\\r\\nFollowing this, Ryan apparently completes his term and refuses to run for a second elected term. Robby Jackson thus campaigns to become the first African American President, but is assassinated on a trip to the South, which enables Kealty to become the next President. (It is also possible from what Jack Ryan Jr. says in Teeth of the Tiger that Jack Sr. resigned, feeling he has done what he needed to as President, and encouraged Robby Jackson to run for the Presidency.) Before Ryan leaves office, he creates \\"The Campus\\", a covert counter-terrorism organization that fronts as Hendley Associates, a financial trading firm. He also writes 100 presidential pardons for its members, with Attorney General Pat Martin's assistance.\\r\\nIn his retirement, Ryan is living easy with a net worth over $80 million. He is working on two versions of his memoirs, one for immediate release, and another detailing his CIA career, to be published posthumously.\\r\\nHowever, in Dead or Alive, he becomes increasingly frustrated with the direction in which President Kealty is taking the country, although he is initially publicly silent. Ultimately, he announces that he will come out of retirement to run for a second full term as President as a Republican candidate. Despite having originally not being involved in the Campus's activities due to his high-profile status, he gradually becomes more directly linked to the Campus's operations, aiding them from behind the scenes on occasion. Here, Ryan learns his elder son, Jack Jr., is a field operative of the Campus.\\r\\nRyan campaigns against Kealty in Locked On, facing off against him in various televised debates. It quickly becomes apparent that Ryan will win the election, as the majority of Americans had never entirely accepted Kealty. Despite the efforts of Paul Laska, a high-profile Czech-American billionaire and a devout enemy of Ryan, and key members of the Kealty administration who labelled Ryan's longtime friend John Clark a fugitive in an effort to expose the Campus (as well as tying Ryan to it by association), Ryan narrowly wins the election, overcoming all of Kealty's efforts to harm him. The President-elect now prepares to undo the damage the Kealty administration has done.\\r\\nRyan initially finds his return to the presidency easy and without struggle following his re-election, but things quickly start to take a turn for the worse. Angered by a contraction in economic growth, the majority of the People's Republic of China Politburo Standing Committee members turn against their procapitalist President Wei Zhen Lin. Wei attempts to commit suicide when a coup is undertaken by other committee members. Only when Chairman Su Ke Qiang orders PLA tanks to defend Wei did he agree to promote and support Su's expansionist policies, in exchange for Su's ongoing protection. The expansionist policies - which include the annexation of Taiwan and the expansion of China's territory into the South China Sea - are finally revealed to the world after several months. The Ryan administration is vehemently against the new policies, and President Ryan himself decides to take action by supporting Taiwan, along with India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, which would also be affected by an expansion of China's territory.\\r\\nA devastating series of cyber attacks on American infrastructure occurs, enacted by the \\"Ghost Ship\\" - a Chinese state-sponsored version of the Campus, using assets of the Chinese Ministry of State Security and Divine Sword Special Forces. The attacks serve to compromise the nation's national security apparatus and weaken the United States' resolve. The Campus helps track the attacks to China, and local investigation pinpoints the exact building where the Ghost Ship is currently quartered. President Ryan orders the destruction of the building, decapitating China's cyberwarfare abilities.\\r\\nRyan makes contact with Wei and warns him that the cyber attacks are considered an act of war on China's part. Wei repeatedly denies the claim, and reiterates he is supporting Su, though Ryan guesses correctly Su is controlling Wei since saving him from the attempted coup. Ryan appeals to Wei as a businessman to understand what he is doing will destroy China. After a lengthy, unusual pause, Wei responds that he must discuss Ryan's claims with Su, providing exact details of when and where Su will be travelling to address the politburo in regards to the war effort. Ryan takes the information as a request from Wei to have the United States assassinate Su. A team from the Campus, with support from the Russian FSB, and working with a local rebel force in China, stages an attack on Su while he is traveling in a motorcade. Su is assassinated by a U.S. sniper, but the event is made to look like Su's own men turned on him. Ryan announces a blockade of China's oil supplies until the war effort is abandoned, calling upon Wei and the politburo to accept defeat.\\r\\nPresident Wei accepts that the expansionist movement has failed and the United States has won its second war with China, and decides to take his own life after realizing the politburo will move against him without Su's protection. Wei botches the suicide by accidentally shooting himself in the cheek, but ends up choking to death on his own blood. Wei and Su's deaths mark the end of the war in the South China Sea, and Ryan emerges the clear victor in the conflict.\\r\\nRyan is featured prominently in Command Authority; Ryan and his administration contend with the Russian Federation, currently led by their new President, Valeri Volodin. Volodin is established as a dedicated communist opposed to the West, seeking to restore Russia as a strengthened Soviet Union. Volodin moves to establish ties with Iran and China, reunify the nation's state security services under the FSB, and most notably annex the Ukraine. Those opposed to his actions are replaced or assassinated by Russian government forces or elements of the \\"Seven Strong Men\\", a Mafia group that is now easily the most powerful and dangerous criminal underworld faction in Russia. Later, when the FSB and SVR merged under the FSB's banner, Volodin makes the announcement that FSB director Roman Romanovich Talanov, Volodin's enigmatic enforcer, is the nation's new intelligence chief.\\r\\nSergey Golovko, having retired from the SVR and effectively exiled from Russia for acting as a high-profile Kremlin dissident against Volodin and his policies, succumbs to poisoning from a radioactive agent while at a private lunch at the White House. Ryan's old friend dies the next day, but on his deathbed, Golovko relays his concerns of Talanov's unknown background and mysterious connection to Volodin to Ryan. Ryan resolves to decipher Talanov's history and work out his links to Volodin, hopeful the answers behind his swift rise to power can be used as leverage against Volodin. As armed conflict becomes increasingly likely, Ryan focuses on the growing armed standoff in the Ukraine and absorption of the Crimea, with the rest of the Ukraine facing imminent Russian invasion. An investigation following Golovko's death implicates the SSM working with the FSB. It also possibly identifies Talanov as a mysterious ex-GRU assassin who operated for the KGB during the Cold War, code-named \\"Zenith\\". Ryan is personally alarmed by these discoveries - he became involved in the Zenith affair in his time with the CIA as a MI6 liaison officer, during an investigation into a string of deaths in Berlin. Ryan ultimately sensed an unknown Russian operator was at work behind the events in Berlin, but he was encouraged by MI6 Director General Sir Basil Charleston to let it go. The mystery of Zenith was left unsolved for 30 years, and remained the sole remaining mystery of Ryan's intelligence career.\\r\\nOperational assets of the Campus, with Jack Ryan Jr. leading the effort (much to his father's displeasure and trepidation for his safety), ultimately confirm Talanov was Zenith, and Volodin, a senior KGB officer at the time, still acts as his control officer. As young men, they were employed by members of the KGB and GRU leadership who knew the Soviet Union would eventually fall, but made a plan to survive and prosper in the chaotic aftermath, so they could seize control of the nation and turn it back to communism stronger than ever. After siphoning billions from Soviet programs to achieve it, Volodin double-crossed his co-conspirators and had Talanov kill them all so it would be theirs alone. Others were killed to maintain the safety of their black funds, including the bankers killed by Talanov during the Zenith affair so as to prevent exposure to the rest of the KGB. Talanov is also the secret leader of the Seven Strong Men, having been sent undercover with the SSM - placed in a gulag, Talanov worked his way up to become a charter member and leader of the Seven Strong Men, and through them become FSB director for the SSM's benefit and control of the government, when in actuality the SSM was a tool for Volodin's policies.\\r\\nThese discoveries are made with the help of former MI5 officer Victor Oxley, \\"Bedrock\\" - an off-book MI5 asset who operated as an assassin during the Cold War in similar fashion to Talanov, aka Zenith. Oxley's final mission before his disappearance was to hunt down and kill Zenith, but instead found Ryan Sr. about to be killed by a German Stasi team working with Zenith. Oxley interfered and saved Ryan's life, but was captured, driven away to Russia, brutally tortured by the KGB, and then imprisoned in the same gulag where Talanov ultimately was placed, accidentally hearing of Talanov being Zenith from other inmates. Oxley and the Campus team confront his traitorous control officer Hugh Castor, who confirms the entire story and protected Volodin and Talanov's secret in exchange for a cut of their black funds, but Castor gives up what he knows for protection by the American government, knowing Talanov will have realized Castor deceived him over the leverage he had. However, Talanov realizes this faster than Castor anticipated - he sends a Spetsnaz team to kill Castor and Oxley, the latter sacrificing himself for Jack Ryan Jr.\\r\\nAs the Russian invasion force pushes into the Ukraine, the Campus team and Delta Force operators arrest Dmitri Nesterov, (Gleb the Scar), an SSM capo who is Talanov's second-in-command and who was behind Golovko's poisoning. With Nesterov and the Campus's acquired information in hand, Ryan makes contact with Volodin and confronts him with implications he could be politically destroyed by what he has learned about Zenith and Talanov's ties to the SSM: claiming (falsely) to have suitable evidence gathered that will ruin his government and the invasion, and he must distance himself from Talanov as the Campus has exposed him as a government spy who has been using them all along. Volodin pulls back his troops; in exchange, the United States keeps what evidence it has secret. Volodin also forces Talanov to resign from the FSB after his criminal dealings are made public and the SSM turns on him. Despite the promise of protection, Volodin allows Talanov to be killed - he is stabbed by a civilian member of his guard force on Nesterov's orders (having been encouraged by John Clark to have Talanov killed so he could succeed him). The stalemate of Russia and the United States is left ongoing.\\r\\nRyan, at this time, is in his mid-sixties and world-famous; and is looking forward to retirement back to the shores of Chesapeake Bay once and for all.\\r\\nRyan is mentioned by title only in Support and Defend; when a National Security Council staff member, Ethan Ross, is exposed by the FBI as a traitor responsible for leaking classified government information so as to weaken the administration's connections with friendly governments. He proceeds to flee as a fugitive to Venezuela, with an intelligence cache with enough information to ruin the CIA. Ryan is said to have made Ross's capture or death the government's top priority, establishing him as America's most wanted. Ryan's nephew, FBI special agent and Campus operative Dominic Caruso, ultimately succeeds in killing Ross and securing the cache for the CIA, despite attempts by the Russian FSB and Iranian Quds Force to acquire it.\\r\\nAll books are written by Tom Clancy.\\r\\nIn the order in which they occur in the storyline (and when they occur):\\r\\nStarting with the following novel, the series becomes distinctly different from real history as noted below.\\r\\nList of books in the Ryan-verse 1970-71: Without Remorse (John Clark #1) 1981: Patriot Games (Jack Ryan #1) 1982: Red Rabbit (Jack Ryan #2) 1984: The Hunt for Red October (Jack Ryan #3) 1986: The Cardinal of the Kremlin (Jack Ryan #4) 1988: Clear and Present Danger (Jack Ryan #5) 1990-91: The Sum of All Fears (Jack Ryan #6) 1995-96: Debt of Honor (Jack Ryan #7) 1996: Executive Orders (Jack Ryan #8) 1999-2000: Rainbow Six (John Clark #2) 2002: The Bear and the Dragon (Jack Ryan #9) 2006: Teeth of the Tiger (Campus #1) 2007: Dead or Alive (Campus #2) 2008: Locked On (Campus #3) 2009: Threat Vector (Campus #4) Command Authority (Jack Ryan #10) Support and Defend (Campus #5) Full Force and Effect (Jack Ryan #11) Under Fire (Campus #6) Commander in Chief (Jack Ryan #12)\\r\\nFive films based on Clancy novels featuring Jack Ryan have been produced. The movie portraying the earliest incarnation of Ryan (fifth film chronologically) is titled Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit and stars Chris Pine. Released on January 17, 2014, it follows Ryan's move from his accident in the Marines into his CIA career. Jack Ryan is also portrayed by Alec Baldwin in the 1990 film The Hunt for Red October, Harrison Ford in Patriot Games (1992), and Clear and Present Danger (1994), and Ben Affleck in the 2002 film The Sum of All Fears.\\r\\nIn the novels, Patriot Games occurs before The Hunt for Red October, though the order was reversed in the film versions. Additionally, The Sum of All Fears is not part of Baldwin/Ford series, but rather an intended reboot of the franchise which departs significantly from the chronology of the novels. It takes place in 2002, whereas the novel takes place in 1991/1992. Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is a second reboot of the franchise and departs from all previous films.\\r\\nIt was announced by Deadline that Carlton Cuse and Graham Roland will be working with Michael Bay and his production company Platinum Dunes and Paramount Television on a Jack Ryan TV series for Amazon.[5][6] On April 29, 2016, Deadline announced that John Krasinski will star as Jack Ryan in the series.[1] On August 16, 2016, Amazon Studios announced they had given a series order for a 10-episode first season of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan.[7] On November 4, 2016, Abbie Cornish was cast as Cathy Muller in the series.[8] On January 6, 2017, it was reported that Morten Tyldum will direct the pilot.[9] In February 2017, it was announced that The Americans director Daniel Sackheim would direct multiple episodes and produce the series.[10] The series is set to premiere in March 2018, and is said to be inspired by the Harrison Ford Jack Ryan films.[11]\\r\\nMany video games based on the series have been made, some based on the novels, some on the films, and some on the spin-offs.\\r\\nIn addition, Ryan is a featured character in many of the Rainbow Six universe video games.","input":"Who is jack ryan and what is he famous for?"},{"output":"Vortec 4300 V6","context":"The Chevrolet Silverado, and its mechanically identical cousin, the GMC Sierra, are a series of full-size and heavy-duty pickup trucks manufactured by General Motors and introduced in 1998 as the successor to the long-running Chevrolet C/K line. The Silverado name was taken from a trim level previously used on its predecessor, the Chevrolet C/K pickup truck from 1975 through 1998. General Motors continues to offer a GMC-badged variant of the Chevrolet full-size pickup under the GMC Sierra name, first used in 1987 for its variant of the GMT400 platform trucks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough General Motors introduced its first pickup truck in 1930, the term \\"Silverado\\" was a designation used only to detail the trim for the Chevrolet C/K pickup trucks, Suburbans, and Tahoes from 1975 through 1999.[1] GMC used a few variations of the \\"Sierra\\" name (e.g. Sierra, Sierra Classic, and High Sierra); however, Chevrolet still uses the CK and the CC in their current model codes.\\r\\nThe Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks have been essentially the same for their entire history. However, there are some trim and add-on option variations. Early models included variations in the engine and equipment, but the present differences are slight. The 1999 model year redesign included different grilles and interior trim, and certain features (e.g. Quadrasteer) were included at different times on the two trucks. The GMC Sierra has a luxury package known as \\"Denali\\" which adds tons of creature comfort features and design changes. Chevrolet's equivalent to the Denali trim level is the High Country Silverado which was introduced in the 2014 model year.\\r\\nThe GMT800 Silverado/Sierra 1500 and 2500 (non Heavy Duty) (light pickup trucks) were released in August 1998 as 1999 models. The \\"classic\\" light-duty GMT400 C/K trucks were continued in production for that first year alongside the new models, and the Heavy-Duty GMT400 pickups (alongside the GMT400 SUVs) were continued through 2000, with the new GMT800 Silverado/Sierra HD (Heavy Duty) being introduced. A small refresh for 2003 models was introduced in 2002, bringing slight design changes and an upgrade to the audio and HVAC controls. The latter 2006 and 2007 GMT800 production units used the name Classic to denote the difference between the first and second generation trucks.\\r\\nThere are a number of models of light-duty Silverados and Sierras, including the half-ton, SS, and Hybrid.\\r\\nThe light-duty trucks use the 1500 name. They are available in three cab lengths, 2-door standard/regular cab, 4-door extended cab, and front-hinged 4-door crew cab. Three cargo beds are available: a 69.2?in (1,758?mm) short box, 78.7?in (1,999?mm) standard box, and a 97.6?in (2,479?mm) long box. The short box is only available with the extended or crew cab, and is the only option on the latter.\\r\\nFor the first year, only the regular cab and an extended cab were available, along with the Vortec 4300 V6, Vortec 4800 V8, and the Vortec 5300 V8. In 2000, a driver's side door option became available for the extended cab, giving it four doors, and the crew-cab body was added to the lineup. Output on the 5.3 L engine also increased to 285?hp (213?kW) and 325?lb?ft (441?N?m).\\r\\nThe 6.0 L Vortec 6000 V8 was standard on the 2500 and was added for the 2001 Heavy Duty models, rated at 300?hp (224?kW), with the GMC Sierra 1500 C3 getting an uprated 25?hp (19?kW) version of this engine. The Silverado Z71 got an optional lighter composite box, with a suspension package for towing, but lacked the high-output engine. The C3 became the Denali for 2002, and Quadrasteer was added.\\r\\nGM introduced a reworked version of the Silverado and Sierra in 2003, with a new front end and a slightly updated rear end. In 2006 the Silverado received another facelift, similar to the HD version introduced in 2005 HD models. In addition to that, Chevrolet has deleted the \\"Chevrolet\\" badge off the tailgate that was used from 1998-2005. Its SUV counterparts retained the use of the pre-facelift sheetmetal.\\r\\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gave the Silverado an overall \\"marginal\\" score on the frontal offset crash test for poor structural integrity and poor dummy control, although no injuries were recorded on the dummy's body regions.[3]\\r\\nGMC created an upscale version of its Sierra 1500 in 2000 called the Sierra C3. It used all-wheel drive with a 3.73 final drive gear ratio and included the 6.0 L Vortec 6000 LQ4 V8 rated at 325?hp (242?kW) at 5000 rpm and 370?lb?ft (502 N{m) of torque at 4000 rpm coupled to a 4L60E-HD four speed automatic transmission along with other upscale equipment. For 2002, the name was changed to Sierra Denali, but the specifications remained essentially the same except for the addition of Quadrasteer and GM changed from the 4L60E-HD to the 4L65E in conjunction with a 4.10 final drive gear ratio.\\r\\nThe Denali is rated for towing 9,100 pounds (4,100?kg) and hauling 1,595 pounds (723?kg) in the cargo box.\\r\\nThe Sierra Denali was initially equipped with Delphi's Quadrasteer system as standard equipment. It was a 4-wheel steering system that greatly reduced the truck's turning radius and improved lane changing while towing. General Motors dropped Quadrasteer from the Sierra Denali after the 2004 model year and its entire lineup after 2005 due to poor sales of this expensive option.[4]\\r\\nFor the '07 model year, the Sierra Denali shares the same billet grille from the other Denali models, and also has the same dash as the '07 SUV's. The '07 Sierra Denali was initially the only half ton pickup that had a 6.2 liter with 403?hp (301?kW) and 417?lb?ft (565?N?m) of torque coupled to a six speed transmission. This truck is also an optional all wheel drive vehicle and goes 0-60?mph in 6.3 seconds.\\r\\nLaunched in early 2003, the Silverado SS is a high-performance pickup truck built by Chevrolet. It is based on the 1500 Silverado with upgrades in drive train and both exterior and interior appearance. It was equipped standard with the 6.0 liter Vortec High-Output V8 rated at 345?hp (257?kW) at 5200 rpm and 380?lb?ft (515?N?m) of torque at 4000 rpm coupled to a 4L65E four speed automatic transmission. This was the same engine used for the second generation Cadillac Escalade. Chevrolet and GMC advertised this engine as the Vortec High Output and later as the \\"VortecMAX\\", while Cadillac calls it the \\"HO 6000\\". The SS debuted in 2003 with a standard All Wheel Drive setup with a 4.10 final drive gear ratio and 4 wheel disc brakes. In 2005, in an attempt to increase sales, a 2-wheel drive version became available (the 2WD SS also lost its rear disc brakes in favor of drums, as did the rest of the 1/2-ton GMT800s). 2005 was also the first year the sun roof was available in the SS line up. In 2006, the AWD variant was dropped and the rear wheel drive was the only driveline layout available. In a further effort to reduce cost, you could also get cloth interior and/ or bench seat. The Silverado SS also comes with the Z60 performance suspension and 20?inch aluminum wheels. All the SS trucks in both 2 wheel drive and AWD used the torsion bar style front suspension for better handling. It should also be noted the SS themed trucks were only available from the factory in Black Onyx, Victory Red, and Arrival Blue Metallic from 2003 to 2004. In 2005 Arrival Blue Metallic was dropped from the color choice and replaced with Silver Birch Metallic...\\r\\nIn 2006, Chevrolet released a special edition Silverado SS under the name \\"Intimidator SS\\" (licensed by Dale Earnhardt Inc.) to honor the late Dale Earnhardt. The truck came with several minor appearance upgrades (rear spoiler, embroidered headrests, Intimidator custom badging), but was essentially just a regular Silverado SS. Of the 1,033 scheduled trucks, only 933 were made (the remaining 100 were sold as 2007 Silverado SS \\"classic\\" bodystyle trucks before the 2007.5 MY changeover. These trucks were only available in Black Onyx exterior but could be ordered with cloth or leather interior. Also features[5]-\\r\\nThe Vortec High Output option was first introduced in 2004 to a limited market (mainly consisting of Texas and several surrounding areas); it was available nationwide for MY 2005. It was available for both the Chevy and GMC 1500 series trucks. This special edition package (under option code B4V) included several options previously not found on the standard 1500 model, most notably the LQ9 6.0 L V-8 engine (the same used for the Silverado SS, the 2005-2006 GMC Denalis and the Cadillac Escalade). The LQ9 motor was rated at 345?hp (257?kW) at 5200 rpm and 380?lb?ft (515?N?m) of torque at 4000 rpm, which was the same specifications shared in the SS models. The B4V package could only be ordered on extended cab standard box 2WD trucks. They were all built at the Canadian assembly plant and were equipped with the Z60 High Performance suspension package, in addition to the M32 = 4L65E transmission, GT4 = 3.73 rear gear, and G80 Gov Lock as standard equipment. The 2004 models were equipped with the standard 10 bolt 8.625 rear end. The 2005 models were upgraded with the larger 14 bolt 9.5 rear end under RPO option AXN. The package also included one style of the newly introduced GM 20?inch wheels installed from the factory. This marked the first time the LQ9 engine was available for a two-wheel drive application. Unlike the previous years with the SS Package, you could order the interior combination in anything from basic cloth to fully loaded. There were also more exterior color options available with this package.\\r\\nIn 2006, the Vortec Max trailering package became available. The Vortec Max package was added to the option list with an array of similar features and new badges, and at its core retained the LQ9/4L65-E powertrain. However, the Vortec Max package differed from the Performance edition in that it also came with a variant of the Z85 Handling/Trailering suspension, as well as 17-inch wheels and tires under the option code NHT on 4x4 models versus the Z60 High Performance Suspension and 20-inch wheel and tire package of the regular B4V 2 wheel drive Performance Edition. This was because the Vortec Max package was intended for max trailer towing, while the Performance Edition was intended more for customers who wanted the Silverado SS mechanicals without the visuals of the SS. It was also made available (in addition to the extended cab) in the light duty 4 door crew cab models. For the first time it was also available in 2 wheel drive or 4 wheel drive on both the Silverados and Sierras, with or without the Z71 package.\\r\\nThe newest Vortec Max performance package introduced in 2006 on the GMT900 includes a 10,800 pounds towing capacity.[6]\\r\\nGM launched a hybrid version of the Silverado/Sierra in 2004, becoming the first ever GM hybrid passenger vehicle. Known within GM as the Parallel Hybrid Truck or PHT it is not actually a parallel hybrid by the current definition, but a type of micro hybrid design. The electric motor housed within the transmission flywheel housing, serves only to provide engine cranking/starting, battery charging, and powering accessories. The engine automatically shuts down as the truck comes to a stop and uses 42 Volt electric power to the starter/generator unit to restart the engine as the brake pedal is released. Besides the typical 12?V automotive battery the PHT uses three additional 12?V valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) batteries mounted under the rear seat to store and provide power. The truck uses a 5.3 L Vortec 5300 V8 for primary propulsion power. These trucks were also purchased back from customers for more than what they were worth in the late 2000s.\\r\\nThe PHT features four 120 volt 20 amp AC outlets, two in the bed and two inside the cab under the rear seat. These are particularly interesting to the building/construction contractor market, since they often require AC power when on the job. Additionally, the extra reserves of power for the accessories make this truck well-suited to that market, where trucks often sit at idle for hours at a time.\\r\\nAvailability was extremely limited at first, with commercial buyers getting the first allotment. Later in 2005, the truck was offered at retail in Alaska, California, Florida, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Canada. For 2006-07 the truck was generally available to retail buyers throughout North America. The Parallel Hybrid Truck was discontinued for the 2008 model year with the release of the GMT900 truck line. Starting in 2009, General Motors offers a second generation Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra equipped with a Two-Mode Hybrid powertrain and 4-speed CVT.[7]\\r\\nThe HD variant is a heavy-duty light truck. It is a strengthened version of the Silverado/Sierra light-duty, and is available in the 1500HD, 2500HD, and 3500HD models. The 1500HD, introduced in 2000, offers a Vortec 6000 V8 with 300?hp (224?kW) at 5200 rpm and 360?lb?ft (488?N?m) of torque at 4000 rpm with a Hydra-Matic 4L80E four-speed automatic transmission. The 2500HD also offers either the LB7 Duramax V8 with 300?hp (224?kW) at 3100 rpm and 520?lb?ft (705?N?m) of torque at 1800 rpm, the LLY Duramax V8 with 310?hp (231?kW) @ 3000RPM and 605?lb{ft (820 N{m) @ 1600RPM, and the LBZ Duramax V8 with 360?hp (268?kW) @ 3200RPM and 650?lb{ft (881 N{m) @ 1600RPM. Also available is the Vortec 8100 V8 with 340?hp (254?kW) at 4200 rpm and 455?lb?ft (617?N?m) of torque at 3200 rpm.\\r\\nThe 2500HD has an available five-speed (six-speed for 2006-2007 models) Allison 1000 transmission with the Vortec 8100 and Duramax 6.6. The Silverado 3500 offers the same engine/transmission features that the 2500HD does, however it is usually equipped with \\"dually\\" twin wheels at the rear and has a stronger suspension. The HD models are primarily used for towing and high-weight cargo. The Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD came in at #2 in a 2016 study by iSeeCars.com ranking the top 10 longest-lasting vehicles. The Silverado 2500HD had 5.7% of vehicles over 200,000 miles, according to the iSeeCars study.[8]\\r\\nTowing capacity for the 1500HD is rated at 10,300 pounds (4,700?kg) and can haul 3,129 pounds (1,419?kg) in the bed depending on options. Towing capacity for the 2500HD is rated at 16,100 pounds (7,300?kg) with the gasoline 8.1L V8 with 3.73:1 rear and can haul 3,964 pounds (1,798?kg) in the bed depending on options. Towing capacity for the 3500HD is rated at 16,700 pounds (7,600?kg) and can haul 5,753 pounds (2,610?kg) in the bed depending on options. The addition of 4 wheel drive tends to reduce the towing and carrying capacity by 200 to 400?lb (181?kg), depending upon year and model. Other factors, such as options, can also affect these numbers.\\r\\n1999ÿ2002 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 regular cab\\r\\n2003ÿ2007 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 crew cab\\r\\nThe Allison 1000 attached to the 6.6L Duramax Diesel\\r\\n2004 Silverado 2500 HD\\r\\n2009 Chevrolet Silverado Single Cab in Chile\\r\\nThe all-new GMT900 generation of the Silverado/Sierra arrived in the last quarter of 2006 as a 2007 model. It features a redesigned exterior, interior, frame, and suspension as well as a power increases on certain engines. It takes styling cues from the 2007 GMT900 SUVs and the Chevrolet Colorado pickups. Like the GMT900 SUVs, these pickups also have greatly improved aerodynamics over their predecessors like steeply raked windshields and tighter panel gaps which improve fuel economy. The GMT800 models were continued through 2007 badged as \\"Classic\\", just as the GMT400 models continued for two years after the GMT800's introduction.\\r\\nThe new Silverado earned the North American Truck of the Year award for 2007 and was Motor Trend magazine's Truck of the Year for 2007. Like its predecessors, the new Silverado offers buyers a choice of two door regular cabs, four door extended cabs (with rear doors that now open 170 degrees similar to the Nissan Titan) and four door crew cabs with the rear doors opening in the same direction as the front doors. GM also offers the trucks in the traditional two and four wheel drive configurations.\\r\\nThe Generation III small block V8 engines offered in the GMT 800 trucks were replaced in the GMT 900 series by the Generation IV small block V8 engine family, featuring upgrades such as increased power and Active Fuel Management on the 5.3 L and 6.0 L V8s. A new high performance 6.2 liter V8 (with 403?hp (301?kW) and 417?lb?ft (565?N?m) of torque) was introduced with the 2007 Cadillac Escalade and 2007 GMC Denali line, and is now available on the Silverado LTZ trim line. After skipping the 2008 model year, with 2007 being the last for the GMT800 hybrid line, a two-mode hybrid model was introduced in late 2008 as a 2009 model. General Motors discontinued the Silverado Hybrid due to poor sales along with the GMC Sierra Hybrid, Chevy Avalanche, Chevy Tahoe Hybrid, GMC Yukon Hybrid, Cadillac Escalade Hybrid, and Cadillac Escalade EXT after the 2013 model year even though it was the one of the two first hybrid pickup trucks ever manufactured.[13] Available in either two- or four-wheel-drive, the Sierra 1500 Hybrid is powered by a 6.0-liter V8. It's joined by two 60-kilowatt electric motors supplied by a nickelÿmetal hydride battery pack under the rear seat. On its own, the V8 is rated at 332 horsepower and 367 pound-feet of torque. GM engineers say that combined output with the electric motors is 379?hp. The unique transmission houses the electric motors along with three different planetary gear sets and four traditional clutches.[14]\\r\\nThere were two dash options offered in this model Silverado and Sierra: a luxury-inspired dash that closely mimics the dash in their GMT900 SUVs, and a more traditional upright dash to make room for a passenger seat in place of a center console.\\r\\nAs of 2008, General Motors full-size trucks were no longer sold in United States and Canada with manual transmissions; they were only offered in Mexico in the Silverado 1500 V6 engine and Silverado 3500.[15]\\r\\nAll Silverado & Sierra 1/2-ton models received a revised bumper and shortened front fascia midway through the 2009 model year and a full mid-cycle refresh followed with all 2010 models, including new interior door panels (which moved the handle forward and added an additional cup holder) and a six-speed automatic transmission on regular and extended cab models with 5.3L or larger V8's was also made standard. Two new exterior colors were added: Taupe Gray Metallic and Sheer Silver Metallic.\\r\\n2007 GMC Sierra Denali\\r\\nChevrolet Silverado Hybrid\\r\\n2009 GMC Sierra Hybrid\\r\\n2012 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LTZ extended cab\\r\\n2013 GMC Sierra Denali Crew Cab\\r\\n6.0 L V8 360?hp (268?kW)[9]\\r\\nThe 8.1 L big-block V8 is no longer offered on the Heavy Duty models, and no replacement has been announced. The 6L90 6-speed automatic transmission is standard in all Heavy Duty models. The Allison 1000 transmission is paired with the optional Duramax V8 diesel.\\r\\nAs of 2011 the GMC and Chevrolet heavy Duty's have being upgraded with a new fully boxed high strength steel frame from front to rear improving stiffness by 92% with bigger rear springs, larger engine and transmission mounts and new hydraulic body mounts to improve the ride.The front suspension incorporates new upper and lower control arms and new torsion bars tailored to one of five different gross axle weight ratings. Upper control arms are constructed from forged steel that is both stronger and lighter than the previous arms, while the new lower arms are cast iron to maximize load capacity. Using a unique torsion bar for each gross weight rating allows for better control over vehicle height, resulting in improved handling and better alignment for reduced tire wear. These improvements allow for up to a 6,000 pound front axle weight rating, allowing all 4wd trucks to accommodate a snow plow. Additional front suspension enhancements come from new urethane bump stops, two per side. The upper shock mount has been changed from a single stem mount to a two-bolt design to eliminate the possibility of squeaks and thumps. The rear suspension design uses asymmetrical leaf springs that are wider and capable of greater load handling. The design features 3-inch wide leaves, with front and rear spring sections of different lengths to reduce the twisting that can result in axle hop and loss of traction. The 2500HD use a two-stage design with a rating of 6,200?lbs, and 3500HD models have a three-stage design with 7,050?lb and 9,375?lb ratings on single and dual-wheel models respectively\\r\\n2012 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD crew cab\\r\\n2012 GMC Sierra Denali HD\\r\\n2008 GMC Sierra 3500HD SLT crew cab\\r\\n2012 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD crew cab\\r\\nFor the 2011 model year of the Silverado/Sierra, the production of crew cab models partially shipped from Silao, Mexico to Flint, Michigan.[16]\\r\\nThe Silverado comes standard with four-wheel ABS.

GM dropped the 900 platform and changed to K2XX. The third generation Silverado 1500 has three gas engine options: 4.3?L EcoTec3 V6, 5.3?L EcoTec3 V8, or 6.2?L EcoTec3 V8. Chevrolet's MyLink touch-screen multimedia interface system will be available on most models. It will have A2DP stereo streaming technologies, Bluetooth hands-free telephone, USB hookups, and an input for an Apple iPod or iPhone. When connected via the USB port, an iPhone 4/4S, iPhone 5/iPhone 5S, iPhone 6, or iPhone 6 Plus will be able to stream music from Pandora Radio. A Bose premium audio system, as well as a Bose surround sound audio system will be available on most models. OnStar will be standard on all models.\\r\\nUnderneath, the Silverado rides on a fully boxed high strength steel frame with hydroforming technology; truck cab's frame is built with high strength steel as well. The third generation Silverado uses aluminum on the hood, for the engine block and for the control arms in order to save mass. The truck's bed is made of roll-formed steel instead of stamped steel used by other manufacturers in order to save weight and gain strength. The third generation Silverado introduced the upmarket High Country edition which includes saddle brown leather interior, which is Chevrolet's first entry into the luxury market. A revised front end features styling cues from the 1980s-era Chevrolet C-Series Trucks, and, on Z-71 models, a Z-71 badge was added to the front grille. The first production Silverado completed assembly on April 29, 2013. The Silverado 1500 went on sale in May 2013 as a 2014 model, with the Silverado HD Series being available in early 2014 for the 2015 model year. On January 10, 2014 a recall was issued for 370,000 Silverado and Sierra pickups due to a fire risk.[23]\\r\\nA rebadged version of the Silverado called the Chevrolet Cheyenne is sold in Mexico.\\r\\nThe American model version of the 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500/2500HD/3500HD and the 2015 Chevrolet Silverado High Country was introduced to the Philippines market by Chevrolet Motorama Show late November 2014 as a MY2015, along with the MY2015 Chevrolet Suburban, 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe, 2015 Chevrolet Impala, 2015 Chevrolet Express Van, 2015 Chevrolet Trax and 2015 Chevrolet Colorado.\\r\\nOn January 14, 2014, The Silverado, along with the Chevrolet Corvette Stingray, received the 2014 North American International Auto Show's Car and Truck of the Year awards.[24]\\r\\nFor the 2015 model year, the 6.2L Ecotec3 was paired with the new 8-speed 8L90 transmission, offering a wider ratio spread with more closely spaced gears, quicker shifts, and improved acceleration and fuel economy.[25] The Silverado 2500/3500 HD models continue to use the 6.0L L96 flex fuel capable Vortec engine combined with the 6l90e transmission, installed with engine oil and transmission fluid coolers for hauling/towing applications.[26]\\r\\nFor that year, Chevrolet introduced Special Edition for the Silverado truck series.

The CUCV nomenclature was changed to Light Service Support Vehicle in 2001. In 2005, LSSV production switched to AM General, a unit of MacAndrews and Forbes Holdings. The LSSV is a GM-built Chevrolet Silverado 1500, Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD, Chevrolet Tahoe, or Chevrolet Suburban that is powered by a Duramax 6.6 liter turbo diesel engine. The various Silverados, Tahoes, and Suburbans that are used provide numerous platforms for different kinds of vehicles. As GM has redesigned its civilian trucks and SUVs from 2001ÿpresent, LSSVs have also been updated cosmetically.[35]\\r\\nThe Militarization of standard GM trucks/SUVs to become LSSVs includes exterior changes such as CARC paint (Forest Green, Desert Sand, or 3-color Camouflage), blackout lights, military bumpers, a brush guard, a NATO slave receptacle/NATO trailer receptacle, a pintle hook and tow shackles. The electrical system is changed to the 24/12 volt military standard. The dashboard has additional controls and dataplates. The truck also can be equipped with weapon supports in the cab, cargo tie down hooks, folding troop seats, pioneer tools, winches, and other military accessories.[35]\\r\\nThe Enhanced Mobility Package (EMP) option adds enhanced suspension, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, a locking differential, on/off-road beadlock tires, a tire pressure monitoring system and other upgrades.

The latter file extension ('vbs', a type of interpreted file) was most often hidden by default on Windows computers of the time (as it is an extensions for a file type that is known by Windows), leading unwitting users to think it was a normal text file. Opening the attachment activated the Visual Basic script. The worm did damage on the local machine, overwriting random types of files (including Office files, image files, and audio files; however after overwriting MP3 files the virus would hide the file), and sent a copy of itself to all addresses in the Windows Address Book used by Microsoft Outlook. In contrast, the Melissa virus only sent copies to the first 500 contacts. This made it spread much faster than any other previous email worm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the machine system level, ILOVEYOU relied on the scripting engine system setting (which runs scripting language files such as .vbs files) being enabled, and took advantage of a feature in Windows that hid file extensions by default, which malware authors would use as an exploit. Windows would parse file names from right to left, stopping at the first period character, showing only those elements to the left of this. The attachment, which had two periods, could thus display the inner fake \\"txt\\" file extension. Text files are considered to be innocuous, as they are normally incapable of running executable code. The worm also used social engineering to entice users to open the attachment (out of actual desire to connect or simple curiosity) to ensure continued propagation. Systemic weaknesses in the design of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Windows were exploited that allowed malicious code capable of complete access to the operating system, secondary storage, and system and user data simply by unwitting users clicking on an icon.\\r\\nMessages generated in the Philippines began to spread westwards through corporate email systems. Because the worm used mailing lists as its source of targets, the messages often appeared to come from acquaintances and were therefore often regarded as \\"safe\\" by their victims, providing further incentive to open them. Only a few users at each site had to access the attachment to generate millions more messages that crippled mail systems and overwrote millions of files on computers in each successive network.\\r\\nThe malware originated in the Pandacan neighborhood of Manila in the Philippines on May 5, 2000, thereafter following daybreak westward across the world, moving first to Hong Kong, then to Europe, and finally the United States, as employees began their workday that Friday morning.[2] [3] The outbreak was later estimated to have caused US$5.5ÿ8.7 billion in damages worldwide,[4][5] and estimated to cost US$15 billion to remove the worm.[6] Within ten days, over fifty million infections had been reported,[7] and it is estimated that 10% of internet-connected computers in the world had been affected.[5] Damage cited was mostly the time and effort spent getting rid of the infection and recovering files from backups. To protect themselves, The Pentagon, CIA, the British Parliament and most large corporations decided to completely shut down their mail systems.[8] The ILOVEYOU virus infected computers all over the world. At the time it was one of the world's most destructive computer related disasters ever.\\r\\nThe events inspired the song E-mail on the Pet Shop Boys' UK top-ten album of 2002, Release, the lyrics of which play thematically on the human desires which enabled the mass destruction of this computer infection.\\r\\nThe ILOVEYOU Script (the attachment) was written in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting (VBS) which runs in Microsoft Outlook and was enabled by default. The script added Windows Registry data for automatic startup on system boot.\\r\\nThe worm then searched connected drives and replaced files with extensions JPG, JPEG, VBS, VBE, JS, JSE, CSS, WSH, SCT, DOC, HTA, MP2, and MP3 with copies of itself, while appending the additional file extension VBS, making the user's computer unbootable. However, MP3s and other sound related files were hidden rather than overwritten.\\r\\nThe worm propagated itself by sending out one copy of the payload to each entry in the Microsoft Outlook address book (Windows Address Book). It also downloaded the Barok trojan renamed for the occasion as \\"WIN-BUGSFIX.EXE\\".\\r\\nThe fact that the virus was written in VBS provided users a way to modify the virus. A user could easily modify the virus to replace important files in the system, and destroy it. This allowed many variations of ILOVEYOU to spread across the internet, each one doing different kinds of damage.[9]\\r\\nSome mail messages sent by ILOVEYOU:\\r\\nOn 5 May 2000, two young Filipino computer programmers named Reonel Ramones and Onel de Guzman became targets of a criminal investigation by agents of the Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).[11] Local Internet service provider Sky Internet had reported receiving numerous contacts from European computer users alleging that malware (in the form of the \\"ILOVEYOU\\" worm) had been sent via the ISP's servers.\\r\\nAfter surveillance and investigation by Darwin Bawasanta of Sky Internet, the NBI traced a frequently appearing telephone number to Ramones' apartment in Manila. His residence was searched and Ramones was arrested and placed on inquest investigation before the Department of Justice (DOJ). Onel de Guzman was likewise charged in absentia.\\r\\nAt that point, the NBI were unsure what felony or crime would apply.[11] It was suggested they be charged with violating Republic Act 8484 (the Access Device Regulation Act), a law designed mainly to penalise credit card fraud, since both used pre-paid (if not stolen) Internet cards to purchase access to ISPs. Another idea was that they be charged with malicious mischief, a felony (under the Philippines Revised Penal Code of 1932) involving damage to property. The drawback here was that one of its elements, aside from damage to property, was intent to damage, and de Guzman had claimed during custodial investigations that he may have unwittingly released the worm.[12]\\r\\nTo show intent, the NBI investigated AMA Computer College, where de Guzman had dropped out at the very end of his final year.[11] They found that, for his undergraduate thesis, de Guzman had proposed the implementation of a trojan to steal Internet login passwords.[13] This way, he proposed, users would finally be able to afford an Internet connection. The proposal was rejected by the College of Computer Studies board,[12] prompting de Guzman to cancel his studies the day before graduation.\\r\\nSince there were no laws in the Philippines against writing malware at the time, both Ramones and de Guzman were released with all charges dropped by state prosecutors.[14] To address this legislative deficiency,[11] the Philippine Congress enacted Republic Act No. 8792,[15] otherwise known as the E-Commerce Law, in July 2000, just two months after the worm outbreak. In 2002, the ILOVEYOU virus obtained a world record for being the most virulent computer virus at the time.[16]","input":"Where did the i love you virus originate?"},{"output":"11779","context":"Ronkonkoma (/r???k??k?m?/ rong-KONGK-?-m?) is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) on Long Island in the Town of Islip, New York, United States.

The phrase was a translation of the Latin term aqua vitae, which was commonly used to describe distilled spirits during the Middle Ages.\\r\\nPeat is rarely used in the malting process, so that Irish whiskey has a smoother finish as opposed to the smoky, earthy overtones common to some Scotches. There are notable exceptions to these rules in both countries; an example is Connemara peated Irish malt (double distilled) whiskey from the Cooley Distillery in Riverstown, Cooley, County Louth.\\r\\nIrish whiskey was once the most popular spirit in the world, though a long period of decline from the late 19th century onwards greatly damaged the industry.[1] So much so that although Ireland boasted over 30 distilleries in the 1890s, a century later, this number had fallen to just three. However, Irish whiskey has seen a great resurgence in popularity since the late twentieth century, and has been the fastest growing spirit in the world every year since 1990. With exports growing by over 15% per annum in recent years, existing distilleries have been expanded and a number of new distilleries constructed. As of August 2017, Ireland now has eighteen distilleries in operation, with at least a further sixteen in the planning stages.[2][3] However, only six of these have been operating long enough to have products sufficiently aged for sale, and only one of these was operating prior to 1975.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word 'whiskey' (or whisky) comes from the Irish (or 'Gaelic') uisce beatha, meaning water of life. Irish whiskey was one of the earliest distilled drinks in Europe, arising around the 12th century (see Distilled beverage). It is believed that Irish monks brought the technique of distilling perfumes back to Ireland from their travels to the Mediterranean countries around 1000 A.D. The Irish then modified this technique to obtain a drinkable spirit. Although termed \\"whiskey\\", the spirit produced during this period would have differed from what we currently recognise as whiskey. The uisce beatha or whiskey produced in historical times would not have been aged, and was often flavoured with aromatic herbs such as mint, thyme or anise.[4] Irish Mist, a whiskey liqueur launched in 1963, is purportedly based on such a recipe.\\r\\nAlthough known to have occurred for hundreds of years, records of whiskey production in Ireland can be difficult to come by, particularly in the earlier years when production was unregulated. Even in later years, as production was frequently illicit, official records bear little reflection of reality.[4] In addition, as many Irish records were traditionally oral, rather than written, details on early production are likely lost.[4]\\r\\nThe oldest known written record of whiskey comes from Ireland in 1405 in the Irish Annals of Clonmacnoise, where it was written that the head of a clan died after \\"taking a surfeit of aqua vitae\\" at Christmas, and its first known mention in Scotland dates from 1494.[5] However, it is known that by 1556 whiskey was widespread, as an Act passed by the English Parliament declared whiskey to be \\"a drink nothing profitable to be drunken daily and used is now universally through the realm of Ireland\\". This Act also made it technically illegal for anyone other than \\"the peers, gentlemen and freemen of larger towns\\" to distil spirits without a licence from the Lord Deputy.[4] However, as Crown control did not extend far beyond the Pale, a fortified area around Dublin, this had little effect.[4]\\r\\nIn 1608, King James I granted one such licence to Sir Thomas Phillips, a landowner in Bushmills, County Antrim.[6] It is through this licence that the Old Bushmills Distillery lays claim to being the oldest surviving grant of licence to distil in the world. However, the current Bushmills distillery and company was not registered to trade until 1784[6] which allows the Kilbeggan Distillery (formerly Locke's Distillery), founded by the McManus family in Kilbeggan, County Westmeath, which has been licensed and distilling since 1757 (not counting the period between 1954 and 2007) to lay claim to the title of the oldest licensed distillery in Ireland.[7] Kilbeggan also has what is believed to be the oldest operational copper pot still in the world, over 250 years old.[8][9]\\r\\nIn 1661, the Crown introduced a tax on whiskey production in Britain and Ireland.[4] Therefore, in theory, all whiskey distillers in Ireland were to register and pay taxes. Although Crown control now extended far beyond the Pale, there is limited official record of whiskey distillation during this period. One reason for this, is that until 1761 registration was done on a voluntary basis.[4] Therefore, as registration entailed paying a tax, it was much avoided for obvious reasons.[4] Another reason, is that those tasked with enforcing the law were frequently local landlords, and if their tenants were the illicit distillers, it was not in their best interests to enforce the law.[4] However, it is known that more distillation occurred than is officially recorded, as when registration later became compulsory, several registrations detail the use of existing facilities.[4]\\r\\nFrom a regulatory perspective, the introduction of this Act is a historical milestone as it provides a clear distinction between licit and illicit whiskey distillation in Ireland. For many years following the introduction of this Act, whiskey produced by registered distillers was known as \\"Parliament whiskey\\",[4] while that produced by illicit producers was, and still is referred to as Poitn, a Gaelic term meaning \\"small pot\\" (often anglicised as poteen) in reference to the small pot stills used by the illicit distillers. However, although traditionally the product of illicit production, many legal varieties of Poitn have come to market in recent years.\\r\\nIn the 18th century, demand for whiskey in Ireland grew significantly, driven both by strong population growth, and by displacing the demand for imported spirits.[10] Growth in the latter is very much visible in the share of Irish duties paid on legal spirits in the late 1700s. In 1770, whiskey only accounted for 25% of the total duty on spirits received by the exchequer, while duty on imported rum accounted for 51%, with the remainder divided equally between brandy and gin.[11] However, by 1790, only twenty years later, whiskey's share accounted for 66%.[11]\\r\\nAs a consequence of this increased demand, some distillers prioritized quantity over quality, to the detriment of their product.[4] This prompted parliament to pass an Act in 1759 prohibiting distillers from using any ingredient other than malt, grain, potatoes or sugar in the production of whiskey, and specifically prohibiting several unsavory ingredients.[4] Another consequence, was that the potential revenue lost to the exchequer through the under-reporting of output at legal distilleries, and the tax avoidance of illicit producers became more significant, prompting parliament to introduce another Act of Parliament. This was enacted in 1779 and significantly reformed how the taxes payable on whiskey production were calculated.[4] Previously, taxes were payable on production volumes, which were subject to manipulation. However, this Act removed the potential for under-reporting by making taxes payable on a distillery's potential output (based on the capacity of its pot stills), rather than its actual, or reported output.[10] In addition, the Act penalised smaller distillers in an attempt to reduce reporting fraud.[12]\\r\\nDue to the stringency of this Act, which made assumptions about output (for instance, a 500-gallon pot still was assumed to produce 33,075 gallons a month)[13] and the minimum numbers of days which a still was in operation per annum (112),[10] many of the smaller, or less efficient registered distilleries were forced underground. In 1779, when the Act was introduced, there were 1,228 registered distilleries in Ireland, however, by 1790, this number had fallen to 246, and by 1821, there were just 32 licensed distilleries in operation.[4][10] This had the effect of concentrating licit distillation in a smaller number of distilleries based mainly in the larger urban centres, such as Cork and Dublin, which offered better markets for legal producers.[10] Whereas, in the rural areas distillation became a more illicit activity. In particular, in the northwest of Ireland, where agricultural lands were poorer and poitn provided a supplemental source of income to the tenant farmers, an income which landlords were again slow to curtail as it would have weakened their abilities to pay rent.[10] The scale of this illicit activity was such, that one surveyor estimated that duty was paid on only 2% of the spirit consumed in northwestern provinces of Ulster and Connaught,[14] while Aeneas Coffey (an excise officer at the time, and later inventor of the Coffey Still) estimated that there were over 800 illicit stills in operation in Inishowen, County Donegal alone.[4] By contrast, illicit distillation in Munster and Leinster was less extensive.[10]\\r\\nBy some measures the Act was successful, as the volume of whiskey on which excise was paid increased from 1.2 million to 2.9 million gallons.[10][14] In addition, it prompted capital investments in establishing larger distilleries (which were more easily regulated), due to the need for economies of scale to profit from legal distillation.[10] However, when demand for whiskey increased in the early 1800s, due to population growth, and changing consumption patterns (which saw it becoming more ingrained in Irish cultural activities),[10] much of the demand was initially met by small-scale illicit distillers who did not need to pay tax or comply with the restrictions of the 1779 Act.[10] In fact, so much illicit spirit was available during this period that the licensed distillers in Dublin complained that it could obtained \\"as openly in the streets as they sell a loaf of bread\\".[15]\\r\\nIn 1823, the authorities, acknowledging the problems with the licensing system, cut the duties by half,[10] and published an Excise Act which significantly reformed the existing legislation, making legal distillation much more attractive.[4] In particular, the reforms removed the need for distillers to rush production in order to produce as much (or more) whiskey than duties would be paid on, leading to improvements in fuel efficiency and product quality, as distillers could operate the stills at a more appropriate pace.[10] In addition, restrictions on the type and capacity of stills used were removed, granting distillers more freedom to tailor their equipment.[10] Another significant reform, was a change to how duty was paid. Previously, duty was charged monthly, based on still output, meaning that distilleries paid tax on whiskey before it was sold.[10] However, under the reforms, duty was to be paid only when the whiskey was actually sold, making its storage in bond more attractive, as less of the distillery's working capital would be tied up in stock.[10]\\r\\nTogether, these reforms greatly improved the distilling landscape, leading to a drop in illicit whiskey production, and a boom in investment in legal distilleries. In 1821, two years before the reforms, there were 32 licensed distilleries in Ireland. However, just four years after the reforms, this number had risen to 82 in 1827, while by 1835 it had reached 93, a 19th-century peak.[10] The increased attractiveness of legal distillation is evident in the scale of the equipment used. Prior to the Excise Act of 1823, the largest pot still in Ireland had a capacity of just 750 gallons. However, by 1825, just two years later, the Midleton Distillery would open with a 31,618-gallon pot still, which remains the largest ever built;[13] the largest pot stills currently in operation in the world (as of 2014), located next door in the New Midleton Distillery, are roughly half this size, at 16,498 gallons (75,000 litres).[16]\\r\\nThough domestic demand would reduce somewhat in the mid-1800s, due to the Temperance movement of the 1830s, and the Great Famine of the 1840s, during which a million died, between 1823 and 1900, whiskey output in Ireland increased fourfold,[4] and with access to the overseas markets provided by the British Empire, Irish whiskey became the most popular spirit in the World, with \\"Dublin whiskey\\" being particularly well regarded.[13]\\r\\nIn the early 1800s, Ireland was the largest spirit market in the United Kingdom, with demand for spirit exceeding that even of more populous England.[10] Therefore, as capacities expanded, Ireland became the largest producer of spirits in the United Kingdom, and Dublin, then the largest market for spirits in Ireland, emerged as a major distilling centre. By 1823, Dublin boasted the five largest licensed distilleries in the country.[10][17] At their peak, the distilleries in Dublin would grow to become the largest in the world, with a combined output of almost 10 million gallons per annum, the largest of which, Roe's Thomas Street Distillery, had an output exceeding 2 million gallons per annum.[13] By 1878, the reputation of Dublin whiskey was such that Distillers Company Ltd., a Scottish distilling firm, having built a distillery in Dublin, claimed that Dublin whiskey could sell for a 25% premium over other Irish whiskey, and that it had a demand five times that of Scotch at the time. Although these figures are likely inflated, they give an indication of the esteem in which Dublin whiskey was held, even by Scottish distillers.[13] During this period, the four largest Dublin distilling firms, of John Jameson, William Jameson, John Powers and George Roe (all family run, and collectively known as the \\"Big Four\\") came to dominate the Irish distilling landscape. The chief output of these distilleries, known as single or \\"pure pot still\\" whiskey, was made from a mix of malted and unmalted barley, and solely distilled in pot stills. The style, having initially emerged as a means of avoiding a 1785 tax on malt, endured although the tax had been later repealed.[18] In fact, even by the late 1880s, only two of Ireland's then 28 existing distilleries were producing single malt whiskey, the rest steadfast in their devotion to \\"pure pot still\\".[18]\\r\\nIn this period, when Irish whiskey was at its zenith, it would have been difficult to imagine that Scotch, then produced by small-scale producers, and almost unheard of outside of Scotland,[4] would soon becomes the world's preeminent drink. Whereas, Irish whiskey, then the world's most popular whiskey, would enter a century of decline, with all of Dublin's great distilleries shutting their doors. So much so, that by the late 20th century, the once popular pure pot still whiskey had almost disappeared entirely, with only two specialist bottlings, Green Spot and Redbreast remaining in existence.[18] However, since 2010, several new single pot whiskeys have been launched.[18]\\r\\nThere were a number of factors, both internal and external, which lead to this decline. However, one of the main turning points was the patenting in 1832 of the Coffey still by Aeneas Coffey. Ironically, Coffey was both the former Inspector General of Excise in Ireland, and subsequently, after leaving the excise service, an Irish distiller himself.[12] His patent, the Coffey still, was a continuous distillation apparatus which offered an improvement on the traditional pot still. Although similar continuous stills had been proposed in the past, including by other Irish distillers themselves, the Coffey still was the most effective, and soon entered widespread use.[12]\\r\\nUnlike traditional pot stills, which were operated in a batch manner, Coffey stills could be operated continuously. This made them cheaper to operate, as they required less fuel, and more efficient to run, producing a continuous, rapid output of spirit. In addition, because technically, continuous distillation entails the conduct of a series of distillation runs in sequence internally within a self-contained unit rather than the conduct of a single distillation within a pot still, Coffey stills were capable of producing a far higher strength output than pot stills. However, this advantage also came with a downside. As a consequence of increasing the alcohol concentration in the product, Coffey stills removed some of the other volatile components responsible for flavour.[12] As a result, their use proved extremely controversial when first introduced.\\r\\nIreland was the initial testing ground for the Coffey still, with Coffey showcasing them in his own distillery and offering them to other Irish distillers. Although there were seven in operation in Ireland by 1833,[10] their use did not become widespread amongst the larger distilleries. In particular, the big four Dublin distillers, proud of their existing produce, scoffed at its use, questioning if its product, grain whiskey, which they termed neutral or silent (i.e. tasteless) spirit, could even be termed whiskey.[4] It wasn't that the distillers were Luddites, afraid of change, their distilleries being amongst the most advanced in the world.[13] The distillers were simply steadfast in the belief that their existing methods yielded a superior whiskey.[12] For instance, John Jameson trialled a Coffey still at his distillery, but chose not adopt the technology because he was not satisfied with the quality of product it produced.[12] Therefore, in the face of opposition in Ireland, Coffey offered his still to the English gin and Scottish whiskey distillers, who proved more receptive, and where the technology gained widespread use.\\r\\nThe adoption of the Coffey still in Scotland was indirectly assisted by Ireland's Great Famine of the 1840s, which lead to the repealing of the Corn Laws, which between 1815 and 1846 had restricted the import of cheaper foreign grain into Britain and Ireland. After the laws were repealed in 1846, cheap American corn could be imported and used to produce neutral spirit in Coffey stills. This spirit, though lacking in taste, could then be blended with traditional pot still derived spirit to produce, a cheaper, \\"blended whiskey\\". This blended whiskey, which was less intense in taste than pure pot still, was to prove popular in Britain, capturing much market share from Irish pure pot still whiskey.\\r\\nDespite changing tastes and falling market share, the adoption of Coffey stills was stubbornly resisted by Irish distillers for many years, with some arguing for restrictions on their use. For instance, in 1878, the big Dublin distillers jointly published a pamphlet entitled \\"Truths about Whisky,\\" in which they referred to the output of Coffey stills as \\"Good, bad or indifferent; but it cannot be whiskey, and it ought not to be sold under that name\\".[19] In 1904, almost seventy years after it had been patented, the Senior Manager of Ireland's largest rural distillery, Allman's of Bandon, placed an outright ban on the introduction of Coffey stills at his distillery in the face of opposition from a director.[4]\\r\\nThe issue came to a head in 1908, when a royal commission was appointed to investigate the issue. By this point 60% of all whiskey produced in Britain and Ireland was made in Coffey stills.[20] In 1909, a royal commission settled the argument once and for all, declaring that whiskey could refer to the output of by either Coffey or pot stills.[20] By comparison, it is interesting to note that a similar debate occurred in France; such that under French law, to be termed \\"Cognac\\", a spirit must be produced using a pot still. Whereas, Coffey stills are permissible in the production of Armagnac.\\r\\nIn addition to the introduction of blended whiskey, and the Irish distillers' failure to account for its appeal to changing tastes, there were a number of additional issues which placed further pressure on the Irish distillers: the Irish War of Independence, the subsequent civil war, and trade war with Britain (which cut off whiskey exports to Britain and all Commonwealth countries, then Irish whiskey's biggest market); prohibition in the United States (1920-1933), which severely curtailed exports to Irish whiskey's second biggest market; widespread counterfeiting of Irish whiskeys in America and Britain; protectionist policies introduced by the Irish Free State Government, which significantly capped whiskey exports in the hope of taxing domestic consumption; and finally, over-expansion and mismanagement at several Irish distilleries. Together, these factors greatly hampered exports and forced many distilleries into economic difficulties and out of business, and by the early 20th century, Scotland had surpassed Ireland to become the World's largest whiskey producer.\\r\\nWhen Alfred Barnard, a British historian, published his account of the distilleries of Britain and Ireland in 1887, there were 28 distilleries in operation in Ireland. By the 1960s, there was only a handful of these remaining in operation, and in 1966, three of these (John Jameson, Powers, and Cork Distilleries Company) chose to amalgamate their operations under the name of Irish Distillers and to close their existing facilities and concentrate their operations in a new purpose-built facility to be constructed beside the Old Midleton Distillery in Co. Cork. In 1972, these were joined by the only other remaining Irish operation, Bushmills, so that by the mid-1970s there were only two whiskey distilleries in operation in Ireland, the New Midleton Distillery and the Old Bushmills Distillery, both owned by Irish Distillers, and with only one of these having operated during Irish whiskey's golden years.\\r\\nProduction reached a nadir at about 400,000ÿ500,000 cases per annum during this period, down from a height of 12 million cases around 1900.[1] However, the late 1980s saw the beginnings of a long and slow resurgence in the Irish whiskey industry, with the establishment of the Cooley Distillery in 1987, and Pernod Ricard's takeover of Irish Distillers in 1988, which led to increased marketing of Irish whiskeys, in particular Jameson, overseas. Since then Irish whiskey has undergone a major resurgence, and for the past twenty years, has been the fastest growing spirit in the world, with annual growth of approximately 15ÿ20% per annum. In 2010, the Kilbeggan Distillery, which had closed in 1954, reopened, bringing the number of operating distilleries up to four. By August 2017, this figure had grown to eighteen, with at least sixteen more in the planning stages.[2][3] As of 2016, sales of Irish whiskey stood at 8.7 million 9-litres cases, up from 4.4 million cases in 2008, with sales projected to exceed 12 million cases (its historical peak) by 2020, and 24 million by 2030.[21][2] As of 2017, roughly 750 people are employed on a full-time basis in the whiskey industry in Ireland.[22] In addition, it is estimated that the industry provides support to a further 4,200 jobs across agriculture and other sectors of the economy.[22]\\r\\nIrish whiskey is a protected European Geographical Indication (GI) under Regulation (EC) No 110/2008.[23] As of 29 January 2016, production, labelling and marketing of Irish whiskey must be verified by the Irish revenue authorities as conforming with the Department of Agriculture's 2014 technical file for Irish whiskey.[24] Key requirements include specifications that:[25]\\r\\nThere are several regulations governing the labelling of Irish whiskeys. In particular:[25]\\r\\nAccording to the Alcoholic Beverage Federation of Ireland (ABFI), as of August 2017 there are 18 whiskey distilleries in operation in Ireland.[3][2] However, many of these are recently established and have not yet aged their own spirits for sale as whiskey:\\r\\nIn addition, there are a number of independently owned brands, such as Clontarf 1014, that purchase and market whiskey sourced from operating distilleries.[52]\\r\\nAccording the Alcoholic Beverage Federation of Ireland, as of November 2016, at least thirteen new distilleries have been granted planning permission in Ireland, with many other projects in various stages of planning. In addition, to the Alltech and Glendalough distilleries mentioned above, which had previously distilled spirit, planned distilleries include:[3][2]\\r\\nThroughout the 18th and 19th centuries, around 1,000 registered distilleries opened and closed across Ireland - with multiples of this number operating illegally.[13] Most of these have disappeared without a trace, only to be remembered by local street names e.g. Bond Street in Dublin. For instance, the excise return for 1800 lists 40 distilleries operating in Dublin city alone, while Drogheda is estimated to have had 15 distilleries in the 1780s, with as many as ten operating in Cork city in the 19th century.[13] Of these numerous ventures, only one, Bushmills, has remained in continuous operation until the present day. However, the Kilbeggan Distillery (est. 1757) which closed in 1954, reopened in recent years, while a new distillery was constructed in Tullamore to replace an existing distillery which also closed in 1954. Some of the notable distilleries previously in operation across Ireland are listed below.[13]\\r\\nIrish whiskey comes in several forms, with the name of the style depending on the type of grain used and the distillation process. Traditionally, Irish whiskey was produced in pot stills. Irish whiskeys made in a pot still fall into two categories.\\r\\nWhiskeys made entirely from malted barley distilled in a pot still within a single distillery are referred to as single malt whiskeys, a style also very commonly associated with Scotch whisky. These may be double or triple distilled.[18]\\r\\nSingle pot still whiskey is made from a mixture of malted and unmalted barley completely distilled in a pot still within a single distillery. This differs from single malt whiskey through the inclusion of raw, unmalted grain in the mash. This style has also historically been referred to as \\"pure pot still\\" whiskey and \\"Irish pot still whiskey\\", with older bottlings and memorabilia often bearing these names. Single pot whiskeys were the most common style of Irish whiskey until the emergence of blends in the 20th century.[18]\\r\\nWhiskey produced from continuous distillation in a column or Coffey still, rather than a pot still, is referred to as grain whiskey. This may be produced from a variety of grains. Lighter and more neutral in taste, this spirit is rarely found on its own, though some examples exist. The vast majority of grain whiskey is used to make blended whiskey, a product made by mixing column still product with richer and more intense pot still product.\\r\\nA mixture of the above styles. Regardless of whether the blended whiskey is made from combining grain whiskey with either single malt whiskey or with single pot still whiskey or both, it is labelled with the same terminology. Blended whiskeys are now the most common style of both Irish and Scotch whiskeys.[18]","input":"How many types of irish whiskey are there?"},{"output":"one hundred","context":"The Indian numbering system is used in the Indian subcontinent (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) and in Burma. The terms lakh or lac (100,000 or 1,00,000 in the Indian system) and crore (10,000,000 or 1,00,00,000 in the Indian system)[1] are used in Indian English to express large numbers. For example, in India 150,000 rupees becomes 1.5 lakh rupees, written as ?1,50,000 or INR?1,50,000, while 30,000,000 (thirty million) rupees becomes 3 crore rupees, written as ?3,00,00,000 with commas at the thousand, lakh, and crore levels, and 1,000,000,000 (one billion) rupees (one hundred crore rupees or one arab ??? ) is written ?1,00,00,00,000. While there are specific terms for numbers larger than 1 crore, these are not commonly used, and most practitioners are not familiar with these. In common parlance, the thousand, lakh, crore terminology repeats for larger numbers. Thus 1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion) becomes 1 lakh crore, and is written as 10,00,00,00,00,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian numbering is equal to the western numbering system from ones then tens then hundreds then thousand then ten thousand. After ten thousand, the Indian and the western numbering divides into two parts. According to the Indian numbering system after ten thousand, it[clarification needed] becomes lakh then ten lakh then crore then ten crore and so on. According to the Western numbering system, after ten thousand, it becomes hundred thousand then million then ten million then hundred million and so on. The two numbering system says that 10,000 (Indian system) = 10,000 (Western system).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian numbering system uses separators differently from the international norm. Instead of grouping digits by threes as in the international system, It groups the rightmost three digits together (till the hundreds place) and thereafter groups by sets of two digits[2].

The day commemorates Saint Patrick and the arrival of Christianity in Ireland,[3] and celebrates the heritage and culture of the Irish in general.[5] Celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals, cilidhs, and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks.[6] Christians who belong to liturgical denominations also attend church services[5][7] and historically the Lenten restrictions on eating and drinking alcohol were lifted for the day, which has encouraged and propagated the holiday's tradition of alcohol consumption.[5][6][8][9]\\r\\nSaint Patrick's Day is a public holiday in the Republic of Ireland,[10] Northern Ireland,[11] the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador (for provincial government employees), and the British Overseas Territory of Montserrat. It is also widely celebrated by the Irish diaspora around the world, especially in the United Kingdom, Canada, United States, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, and New Zealand. Saint Patrick's Day is celebrated in more countries than any other national festival.[12] Modern celebrations have been greatly influenced by those of the Irish diaspora, particularly those that developed in North America. In recent years, there has been criticism of Saint Patrick's Day celebrations for having become too commercialised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPatrick was a 5th-century Romano-British Christian missionary and bishop in Ireland. Much of what is known about Saint Patrick comes from the Declaration, which was allegedly written by Patrick himself. It is believed that he was born in Roman Britain in the fourth century, into a wealthy Romano-British family. His father was a deacon and his grandfather was a priest in the Christian church. According to the Declaration, at the age of sixteen, he was kidnapped by Irish raiders and taken as a slave to Gaelic Ireland.[13] It says that he spent six years there working as a shepherd and that during this time he \\"found God\\". The Declaration says that God told Patrick to flee to the coast, where a ship would be waiting to take him home. After making his way home, Patrick went on to become a priest.\\r\\nAccording to tradition, Patrick returned to Ireland to convert the pagan Irish to Christianity. The Declaration says that he spent many years evangelising in the northern half of Ireland and converted \\"thousands\\". Patrick's efforts against the druids were eventually turned into an allegory in which he drove \\"snakes\\" out of Ireland (Ireland never had any snakes).\\r\\nTradition holds that he died on 17 March and was buried at Downpatrick. Over the following centuries, many legends grew up around Patrick and he became Ireland's foremost saint.\\r\\nToday's St Patrick's Day celebrations have been greatly influenced by those that developed among the Irish diaspora, especially in North America. Until the late 20th century, St Patrick's Day was often a bigger celebration among the diaspora than it was in Ireland.[12]\\r\\nCelebrations generally involve public parades and festivals, Irish traditional music sessions (cilithe), and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks.[6] There are also formal gatherings such as banquets and dances, although these were more common in the past. St Patrick's Day parades began in North America in the 18th century but did not spread to Ireland until the 20th century.[14] The participants generally include marching bands, the military, fire brigades, cultural organisations, charitable organisations, voluntary associations, youth groups, fraternities, and so on. However, over time, many of the parades have become more akin to a carnival. More effort is made to use the Irish language, especially in Ireland, where the week of St Patrick's Day is \\"Irish language week\\". Recently, famous landmarks have been lit up in green on St Patrick's Day.\\r\\nChristians may also attend church services,[5][7] and the Lenten restrictions on eating and drinking alcohol are lifted for the day. Perhaps because of this, drinking alcohol ÿ particularly Irish whiskey, beer, or cider ÿ has become an integral part of the celebrations.[5][6][8][9] The St Patrick's Day custom of \\"drowning the shamrock\\" or \\"wetting the shamrock\\" was historically popular, especially in Ireland. At the end of the celebrations, a shamrock is put into the bottom of a cup, which is then filled with whiskey, beer, or cider. It is then drunk as a toast to St Patrick, Ireland, or those present. The shamrock would either be swallowed with the drink or taken out and tossed over the shoulder for good luck.[15][16][17]\\r\\nOn St Patrick's Day, it is customary to wear shamrocks, green clothing or green accessories (the \\"wearing of the green\\"), the colour associated with Catholics in Ireland (orange is the colour associated with Protestant Christians). St Patrick is said to have used the shamrock, a three-leaved plant, to explain the Holy Trinity to the pagan Irish.[18][19] This story first appears in writing in 1726, though it may be older. In pagan Ireland, three was a significant number and the Irish had many triple deities, a fact that may have aided St Patrick in his evangelisation efforts.[20][21] Patricia Monaghan says there is no evidence that the shamrock was sacred to the pagan Irish.[20] However, Jack Santino speculates that it may have represented the regenerative powers of nature, and was recast in a Christian context??icons of St Patrick often depict the saint \\"with a cross in one hand and a sprig of shamrocks in the other\\".[22] Roger Homan writes, \\"We can perhaps see St Patrick drawing upon the visual concept of the triskele when he uses the shamrock to explain the Trinity\\".[23]\\r\\nThe colour green has been associated with Ireland since at least the 1640s, when the green harp flag was used by the Irish Catholic Confederation. Green ribbons and shamrocks have been worn on St Patrick's Day since at least the 1680s.[24] The Friendly Brothers of St Patrick, an Irish fraternity founded in about 1750,[25] adopted green as its colour.[26] However, when the Order of St. Patrickan Anglo-Irish chivalric orderwas founded in 1783 it adopted blue as its colour, which led to blue being associated with St Patrick. During the 1790s, green would become associated with Irish nationalism, due to its use by the United Irishmen. This was a republican organisationled mostly by Protestants but with many Catholic memberswho launched a rebellion in 1798 against British rule. The phrase \\"wearing of the green\\" comes from a song of the same name, which laments United Irishmen supporters being persecuted for wearing green. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the colour green and its association with St Patrick's Day grew.[27]\\r\\nThe wearing of the 'St Patrick's Day Cross' was also a popular custom in Ireland until the early 20th century. These were a Celtic Christian cross made of paper that was \\"covered with silk or ribbon of different colours, and a bunch or rosette of green silk in the centre\\".[28]\\r\\nSaint Patrick's feast day, as a kind of national day, was already being celebrated by the Irish in Europe in the ninth and tenth centuries. In later times, he became more and more widely seen as the patron of Ireland.[29] Saint Patrick's feast day was finally placed on the universal liturgical calendar in the Catholic Church due to the influence of Waterford-born Franciscan scholar Luke Wadding[30] in the early 1600s. Saint Patrick's Day thus became a holy day of obligation for Roman Catholics in Ireland. It is also a feast day in the Church of Ireland, which is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The church calendar avoids the observance of saints' feasts during certain solemnities, moving the saint's day to a time outside those periods. St Patrick's Day is occasionally affected by this requirement, when 17 March falls during Holy Week. This happened in 1940, when Saint Patrick's Day was observed on 3 April to avoid it coinciding with Palm Sunday, and again in 2008, where it was officially observed on 15 March.[31] St Patrick's Day will not fall within Holy Week again until 2160.[32][33] However, the popular festivities may still be held on 17 March or on a weekend near to the feast day.[34]\\r\\nIn 1903, St Patrick's Day became an official public holiday in Ireland. This was thanks to the Bank Holiday (Ireland) Act 1903, an act of the United Kingdom Parliament introduced by Irish Member of Parliament James O'Mara.[35] O'Mara later introduced the law which required that public houses be shut on 17 March after drinking got out of hand, a provision that was repealed in the 1970s.\\r\\nThe first St Patrick's Day parade in Ireland was held in Waterford in 1903. The week of St Patrick's Day 1903 had been declared Irish Language Week by the Gaelic League and in Waterford they opted to have a procession on Sunday 15 March. The procession comprised the Mayor and members of Waterford Corporation, the Trades Hall, the various trade unions and bands who included the 'Barrack St Band' and the 'Thomas Francis Meagher Band'.[36] The parade began at the premises of the Gaelic League in George's St and finished in the Peoples Park, where the public were addressed by the Mayor and other dignitaries.[37][38] On Tuesday 17 March, most Waterford businessesincluding public houseswere closed and marching bands paraded like they had two days previously.[39] The Waterford Trades Hall had been emphatic that the National Holiday be observed.[37]\\r\\nOn St Patrick's Day 1916, the Irish Volunteers ÿ an Irish nationalist paramilitary organisation ÿ held parades throughout Ireland. The authorities recorded 38 St Patrick's Day parades, involving 6,000 marchers, almost half of whom were said to be armed.[40] The following month, the Irish Volunteers launched the Easter Rising against British rule. This marked the beginning of the Irish revolutionary period and led to the Irish War of Independence and Civil War. During this time, St Patrick's Day celebrations in Ireland were muted, although the day was sometimes chosen to hold large political rallies.[41] The celebrations remained low-key after the creation of the Irish Free State; the only state-organized observance was a military procession and trooping of the colours, and an Irish-language mass attended by government ministers.[42] In 1927, the Irish Free State government banned the selling of alcohol on St Patrick's Day, although it remained legal in Northern Ireland. The ban was not repealed until 1961.[43]\\r\\nThe first official, state-sponsored St Patrick's Day parade in Dublin took place in 1931.[44]\\r\\nIn Northern Ireland, the celebration of St Patrick's Day was affected by sectarian divisions.[45] A majority of the population were Protestant Ulster unionists who saw themselves as British, while a substantial minority were Catholic Irish nationalists who saw themselves as Irish. Although it was a public holiday, Northern Ireland's unionist government did not officially observe St Patrick's Day.[45] During the conflict known as the Troubles (late 1960sÿlate 1990s), public St Patrick's Day celebrations were rare and tended to be associated with the Catholic community.[45] In 1976, loyalists detonated a car bomb outside a pub crowded with Catholics celebrating St Patrick's Day in Dungannon; four civilians were killed and many injured. However, some Protestant unionists attempted to 're-claim' the festival, and in 1985 the Orange Order held its own St Patrick's Day parade.[45] Since the end of the conflict in 1998 there have been cross-community St Patrick's Day parades in towns throughout Northern Ireland, which have attracted thousands of spectators.[45]\\r\\nIn the mid-1990s the government of the Republic of Ireland began a campaign to use St Patrick's Day to showcase Ireland and its culture.[46] The government set up a group called St Patrick's Festival, with the aims:\\r\\nThe first St Patrick's Festival was held on 17 March 1996. In 1997, it became a three-day event, and by 2000 it was a four-day event. By 2006, the festival was five days long; more than 675,000 people attended the 2009 parade. Overall 2009's five-day festival saw almost 1?million visitors, who took part in festivities that included concerts, outdoor theatre performances, and fireworks.[48] Skyfest forms the centrepiece of the festival.\\r\\nThe topic of the 2004 St Patrick's Symposium was \\"Talking Irish\\", during which the nature of Irish identity, economic success, and the future were discussed. Since 1996, there has been a greater emphasis on celebrating and projecting a fluid and inclusive notion of \\"Irishness\\" rather than an identity based around traditional religious or ethnic allegiance. The week around St Patrick's Day usually involves Irish language speakers using more Irish during Seachtain na Gaeilge (\\"Irish Language Week\\").[citation needed]\\r\\nChristian leaders in Ireland have expressed concern about the secularisation of St Patrick's Day. In The Word magazine's March 2007 issue, Fr Vincent Twomey wrote, \\"It is time to reclaim St Patrick's Day as a church festival\\". He questioned the need for \\"mindless alcohol-fuelled revelry\\" and concluded that \\"it is time to bring the piety and the fun together\\".[49]\\r\\nAs well as Dublin, many other cities, towns, and villages in Ireland hold their own parades and festivals, including Cork, Belfast, Derry, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, and Waterford.\\r\\nThe biggest celebrations outside the cities are in Downpatrick, County Down, where Saint Patrick is said to be buried. The shortest St. Patrick's Day parade in the world formerly took place in Dripsey, County Cork. The parade lasted just 23.4 metres and traveled between the village's two pubs. The annual event began in 1999, but ceased after five years when one of the two pubs closed.[50]\\r\\nIn Great Britain, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother used to present bowls of shamrock flown over from Ireland to members of the Irish Guards, a regiment in the British Army. The Irish Guards still wear shamrock on this day, flown in from Ireland.[51]\\r\\nChristian denominations in Great Britain observing his feast day include The Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church.[52]\\r\\nHorse racing at the Cheltenham Festival attracts large numbers of Irish people, both residents of Britain and many who travel from Ireland, and usually coincides with St Patrick's Day.[53]\\r\\nBirmingham holds the largest St Patrick's Day parade in Britain with a city centre parade[54] over a two-mile (3?km) route through the city centre. The organisers describe it as the third biggest parade in the world after Dublin and New York.[55]\\r\\nLondon, since 2002, has had an annual St Patrick's Day parade which takes place on weekends around the 17th, usually in Trafalgar Square. In 2008 the water in the Trafalgar Square fountains was dyed green.\\r\\nLiverpool has the highest proportion of residents with Irish ancestry of any English city.[56] This has led to a long-standing celebration on St Patrick's Day in terms of music, cultural events and the parade.\\r\\nManchester hosts a two-week Irish festival in the weeks prior to St Patrick's Day. The festival includes an Irish Market based at the city's town hall which flies the Irish tricolour opposite the Union Flag, a large parade as well as a large number of cultural and learning events throughout the two-week period.[57]\\r\\nThe first St Patrick's Day parade took place in Russia in 1992.[58] Since 1999, there has been a yearly \\"Saint Patrick's Day\\" festival in Moscow and other Russian cities.[59] The official part of the Moscow parade is a military-style parade and is held in collaboration with the Moscow government and the Irish embassy in Moscow. The unofficial parade is held by volunteers and resembles a carnival. In 2014, Moscow Irish Week was celebrated from 12 to 23 March, which includes St Patrick's Day on 17 March. Over 70 events celebrating Irish culture in Moscow, St Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Voronezh, and Volgograd were sponsored by the Irish Embassy, the Moscow City Government, and other organisations.[60]\\r\\nIn 2017, the Russian Orthodox Church added the feast day of Saint Patrick to its liturgical calendar, to be celebrated on 30 March?[O.S. 17 March].[61]\\r\\nThe Scottish town of Coatbridge, where the majority of the town's population are of Irish descent,[62][63] also has a Saint Patrick's Day Festival which includes celebrations and parades in the town centre.[63][64]\\r\\nGlasgow has a considerably large Irish population; due, for the most part, to the Irish immigration during the 19th century. This immigration was the main cause in raising the population of Glasgow by over 100,000 people.[65] Due to this large Irish population, there are many Irish-themed pubs and Irish interest groups who hold yearly celebrations on St Patrick's day in Glasgow. Glasgow has held a yearly St Patrick's Day parade and festival since 2007.[66]\\r\\nWhile Saint Patrick's Day in Switzerland is commonly celebrated on 17 March with festivities similar to those in neighbouring central European countries, it is not unusual for Swiss students to organise celebrations in their own living spaces on St Patrick's Eve. Most popular are usually those in Zurich's Kreis 4. Traditionally, guests also contribute with beverages and dress in green.[67]\\r\\nSt Patrick's Parades are now held in many locations across Japan.[68] The first parade, in Tokyo, was organised by The Irish Network Japan (INJ) in 1992.\\r\\nThe Irish Association of Korea has celebrated Saint Patrick's Day since 1976 in Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. The place of the parade and festival has been moved from Itaewon and Daehangno to Cheonggyecheon.[69]\\r\\nIn Malaysia, the St Patrick's Society of Selangor, founded in 1925, organises a yearly St Patrick's Ball, described as the biggest St Patrick's Day celebration in Asia. Guinness Anchor Berhad also organises 36 parties across the country in places like the Klang Valley, Penang, Johor Bahru, Malacca, Ipoh, Kuantan, Kota Kinabalu, Miri and Kuching.\\r\\nThe tiny island of Montserrat is known as the \\"Emerald Island of the Caribbean\\" because of its founding by Irish refugees from Saint Kitts and Nevis. Montserrat is one of three places where St Patrick's Day is a public holiday, along with Ireland and the Canadian province of Newfoundland & Labrador. The holiday in Montserrat also commemorates a failed slave uprising that occurred on 17 March 1768.[70]\\r\\nAstronauts on board the International Space Station have celebrated the festival in different ways. Irish-American Catherine Coleman played a hundred-year-old flute belonging to Matt Molloy and a tin whistle belonging to Paddy Moloney, both members of the Irish music group The Chieftains, while floating weightless in the space station on Saint Patrick's Day in 2011.[71][72][73] Her performance was later included in a track called \\"The Chieftains in Orbit\\" on the group's album, Voice of Ages.[74]\\r\\nChris Hadfield took photographs of Ireland from earth orbit, and a picture of himself wearing green clothing in the space station, and posted them online on Saint Patrick's Day in 2013. He also posted online a recording of himself singing \\"Danny Boy\\" in space.[75][76]\\r\\nOne of the longest-running and largest St Patrick's Day parades in North America occurs each year in Montreal,[77] whose city flag includes a shamrock in its lower-right quadrant. The yearly celebration has been organised by the United Irish Societies of Montreal since 1929. The parade has been held yearly without interruption since 1824. St Patrick's Day itself, however, has been celebrated in Montreal since as far back as 1759 by Irish soldiers in the Montreal Garrison following the British conquest of New France.\\r\\nIn Manitoba, the Irish Association of Manitoba runs a yearly three-day festival of music and culture based around St Patrick's Day.[78]\\r\\nIn 2004, the CelticFest Vancouver Society organised its first yearly festival in downtown Vancouver to celebrate the Celtic Nations and their cultures. This event, which includes a parade, occurs each year during the weekend nearest St Patrick's Day.[79]\\r\\nIn Quebec City, there was a parade from 1837 to 1926. The Quebec City St-Patrick Parade returned in 2010 after more than 84 years. For the occasion, a portion of the New York Police Department Pipes and Drums were present as special guests.\\r\\nThere has been a parade held in Toronto since at least 1863.[80] The Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team was known as the Toronto St. Patricks from 1919 to 1927, and wore green jerseys. In 1999, when the Maple Leafs played on St Patrick's Day, they wore green St Patrick's retro uniforms. There is a large parade in the city's downtown on the Sunday before 17 March which attracts over 100,000 spectators.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome groups, notably Guinness, have lobbied to make Saint Patrick's Day a national holiday.[81]\\r\\nIn March 2009, the Calgary Tower changed its top exterior lights to new green CFL bulbs just in time for St Patrick's Day. Part of an environmental non-profit organisation's campaign (Project Porchlight), the green represented environmental concerns. Approximately 210 lights were changed in time for Saint Patrick's Day, and resembled a Leprechaun's hat. After a week, white CFLs took their place. The change was estimated to save the Calgary Tower some $12,000 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 104 tonnes.[82]\\r\\nSt Patrick's Day, while not a legal holiday in the United States, is nonetheless widely recognised and observed throughout the country as a celebration of Irish and Irish-American culture. Celebrations include prominent displays of the colour green, religious observances, numerous parades, and copious consumption of alcohol.[83] The holiday has been celebrated in North America since the late 18th century.\\r\\nIn Buenos Aires, a party is held in the downtown street of Reconquista, where there are several Irish pubs;[84][85] in 2006, there were 50,000 people in this street and the pubs nearby.[86] Neither the Catholic Church nor the Irish community, the fifth largest in the world outside Ireland,[87] take part in the organisation of the parties.\\r\\nIn recent decades, St Patrick's Day celebrations have been criticised, particularly for their association with public drunkenness and disorder. Some argue that the festivities have become too commercialised and tacky,[88][89] and have strayed from their original purpose of honouring St Patrick and Irish heritage.[88][90][91] Journalist Niall O'Dowd has criticised recent attempts to recast St Patrick's Day as a celebration of multiculturalism rather than a celebration of Irishness.[92]\\r\\nSt Patrick's Day celebrations have also been criticised for fostering demeaning stereotypes of Ireland and Irish people.[88] An example is the wearing of 'leprechaun outfits',[93] which are based on derogatory 19th century caricatures of the Irish.[94] In the run up to St Patrick's Day 2014, the Ancient Order of Hibernians successfully campaigned to stop major American retailers from selling novelty merchandise that promoted negative Irish stereotypes.[95]\\r\\nSome have described St Patrick's Day celebrations outside Ireland as displays of \\"Plastic Paddyness\\"; where foreigners appropriate and misrepresent Irish culture, claim Irish identity, and enact Irish stereotypes.[96]\\r\\nLGBT groups in the US were banned from marching in St. Patrick's Day parades in New York City and Boston, resulting in the landmark Supreme Court decision of Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, & Bisexual Group of Boston. In New York City, the ban was lifted in 2014,[97] but LGBT groups still find that barriers to participation exist.[98] In Boston, the ban on LGBT group participation was lifted in 2015.[99]\\r\\n(federal) = federal holidays, (state) = state holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (week) = weeklong holidays, (month) = monthlong holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\\r\\nBold indicates major holidays commonly celebrated in the United States, which often represent the major celebrations of the month.","input":"When was st patrick's day first celebrated?"},{"output":"Syracuse University","context":"The 1959 NCAA University Division football season saw Syracuse University crowned as the national champion by both final polls, the AP writers poll and the UPI coaches polls.[2][3][4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nA major rule change widened the goal posts from 18?ft 6?in (5.64?m) to 23?ft 4?in (7.11?m).

The extent of that recognition came in the form of acknowledgment in the annual NCAA Football Guide of the \\"unofficial\\" national champions.  The AP poll in 1959 consisted of the votes of as many as 201 sportswriters.  Though not all writers voted in every poll, each would give their opinion of the twenty best teams.  Under a point system of 20 points for first place, 19 for second, etc., the \\"overall\\" ranking was determined.  Although the rankings were based on the collective opinion of the representative sportswriters, the teams that remained \\"unbeaten and untied\\" were generally ranked higher than those that had not.  A defeat, even against a strong opponent, tended to cause a team to drop in the rankings, and a team with two or more defeats was unlikely to remain in the Top 20.

It can be divided into two periods: the Conquista se?orial, carried out by Castilian nobility in exchange for a covenant of allegiance with the crown, and the Conquista realenga, carried out by the Spanish crown itself, during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ties between the Canaries and the Mediterranean world which had existed since antiquity were interrupted by the decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire. Although these linkages were weakened, they were not totally severed, and the Canaries' isolation was not total. During the Middle Ages, the first reports on the Canaries come from Arabic sources, which refer to some Atlantic islands which may have been the Canaries. What does seem clear is that this knowledge of the islands did not signify the end of the cultural isolation of the native inhabitants.\\r\\nVisits to the archipelago began to increase after the end of the 13th century for reasons including:\\r\\nThe first visit by a European to the Canary Islands since antiquity was by Genoese captain Lanceloto Malocello traditionally dated 1312 (but possibly a little later, between 1318ÿ1325).[1] Malocello's motives were unclear - it is believed he might have been searching for traces of the Vivaldi brothers who had disappeared off Morocco, around Cape Non back in 1291.[2] Malocello made landfall (possibly shipwrecked) on Lanzarote island, and remained there for nearly twenty years. Malocello may have attempted to erect himself as a ruler among the aboriginal peoples and been eventually expelled by them.\\r\\nAccording to some sources, shortly after his return to Europe, in 1336, Malocello led a return expedition to the Canaries, sponsored by King Dinis of Portugal. However, the existence of this expedition has been dismissed by most modern historians, as being based on later forged documents.[3]\\r\\nEvidently drawing from the information provided by Malocello, in 1339 appeared the portolan map by Angelino Dulcert of Majorca showing the Canary island of Lanzarote (named Insula de Lanzarotus Marocelus and marked by a Genoese shield), as well as the island of Forte Vetura (Fuerteventura) and Vegi Mari (Lobos).[4] Although earlier maps had shown fantastical depictions of the \\"Fortunate Islands\\" (on the basis of their mention in Pliny), this is the first European map where the actual Canary islands make a solid appearance (although Dulcert also includes some fantastic islands himself, notably Saint Brendan's Island, and three islands he names Primaria, Capraria and Canaria).[4]\\r\\nIn 1341, a three-ship expedition sponsored by King Afonso IV of Portugal, set out from Lisbon, commanded by Florentine captain Angiolino del Tegghia de Corbizzi and Genoese captain Nicoloso da Recco, and employing a mixed crew of Italians, Portuguese and Castilians. Cruising the archipelago for five months, the expedition mapped thirteen islands (seven major, six minor) and surveyed the primeval aboriginal inhabitants, the 'Guanches', bringing back four natives to Lisbon.[5] (This expedition would become the basis of later Portuguese claims of priority on the islands.)\\r\\nEuropean interest in the Canaries picked up quickly after the 1341 mapping expedition. The descriptions of the primeval Guanches, in particular, drew the attention of European merchants, who immediately saw the prospect of new and easy slave-raiding grounds. In 1342, two Majorcan expeditions, one under Francesc Duvalers, another under Domenech Gual, assembled by private merchant consortia with a commission from Roger de Robenach (representative of James III of Majorca) set out for the Canary islands. The results of these expeditions are uncertain.\\r\\nThe Catholic Church was also drawn by the news. In 1344, the Castilian-French noble Luis de la Cerda (Count of Clermont and Admiral of France), then serving as a French ambassador to the papal court in Avignon, submitted a proposal to Pope Clement VI, offering the Church the more palatable vision of conquering the islands and converting the native Canarians to Christianity.[6] In November 1344, Pope Clement VI issued the bull Tuae devotionis sinceritas granting the Canary islands in perpetuity to Luis de la Cerda and bestowing upon him the title of sovereign \\"Prince of Fortuna\\". The pope followed this up with another bull, in January 1345, giving the projected Cerda-led conquest and conversion of the islands the character of a crusade, granting indulgences to its participants, and papal letters were dispatched to the Iberian monarchs urging them to provide material assistance to Cerda's expedition.[7] The Portuguese king Afonso IV immediately lodged a protest, claiming priority of discovery, but conceded to the authority of the pope.[8] Alfonso XI of Castile also protested, claiming that, by the ancient Visigothic dioceses and prior reconquista treaties, the islands fell within the Castilian jurisdiction and 'sphere of conquest', but nonetheless recognized Cerda's title.[9] Despite their formal concessions, preparations were stalled by the opposition of the Iberian monarchs, with the result that no expedition was mounted before Cerda's death in 1348.\\r\\nWith De la Cerda out of the picture, other parties resumed their adventures and we have notices of further expeditions by Majorcans (now annexed to Aragon) to the area - Jaume Ferrer in 1346 (aiming for Senegal, but might have touched the Canaries), Arnau Roger in 1352, and a royal-sponsored expedition by Joan Mora in 1366 (with instructions to also patrol for interlopers). These expeditions (and doubtless many other unrecorded ones, not only by Majorcans, but also likely by merchants of Seville and Lisbon) were almost wholly commercial, with the primary purpose of capturing native islanders to sell as slaves in European markets[citation needed]. But there was also some peaceful trade with the locals, particularly for orchil and dragon's blood, which grew wildly on the islands and were much valued as dyes by the European cloth industry.\\r\\nThe pope did not give up on his hope of converting the natives. In 1351, Pope Clement VI endorsed an expedition by Majorcan captains Joan Doria and Jaume Segarra, with the object of bringing Franciscan missionaries, including twelve converted Canarian natives (apparently seized by previous Majorcan expeditions), to the islands.[10] Whether this expedition ever set out is uncertain. Apocryphal legend relates the missionaries succeeded established an evangelizing center at Telde (on Gran Canaria), which the pope elevated to the 'Diocese of Fortuna' (although no bull to that effect has been found), until they were expelled in a native uprising in 1354. More confidently is the bull issued in July 1369 by the Avignon Pope Urban V erecting the diocese of Fortuna and appointing Fr. Bonnant Tari as bishop, and a follow-up bull of September 1369 instructing the bishops of Barcelona and Tortosa to dispatch 10 secular and 20 regular clergy to preach to the Canarians in their native languages.[11] But whether this actually set out or just remained a paper project is also uncertain. We have a more reliable record of a Majorcan expedition in 1386 carried out by 'Pauperes Heremite', sponsored by Peter IV Aragon and Pope Urban VI. Although their exact fate is unknown, there is a later report that thirteen \\"Christian friars\\" who had been preaching in the Canaries \\"for seven years\\" were massacred in an uprising during 1391.[12] At least five missionary expeditions would be sent (or at least planned) between 1352 and 1386.[13]\\r\\nGeographic knowledge of the Canary islands coalesced with these expeditions. La Gomera and El Hierro are depicted in the 1367 portolan of the brothers Domenico and Francesco Pizzigano. The Catalan Atlas of 1375 shows the Canaries almost completely and accurately mapped (only La Palma is missing). The eleven islands are named in the Catalan Atlas (from east to west) as Graciosa (La Graciosa),laregranza (Alegranza), rocho (Roque), Insula de lanzaroto maloxelo (Lanzarote), insula de li vegi marin (Lobos), forteventura (Fuerteventura), Insula de Canaria (Gran Canaria), Insula del infernio (Tenerife), insula de gomera (La Gomera), insula de lo fero (El Hierro).[14] The name 'tenerefiz' is first given alongside 'Infierno' in the 1385 Libro del Conoscimiento.\\r\\nDuring the 1370s, when Portugal and Castile were engaged in dynastic wars following the assassination of Peter I of Castile, Portuguese and Castilian privateers were dispatched against each other, several of which made detours to the Canary islands for shelter or slave-raiding jaunts[citation needed]. Ignoring the 1344 bull, Ferdinand I of Portugal granted (in 1370) the islands of Lanzarote and La Gomera to the adventurer 'Lan?arote da Franquia' (believed by some to be none other than the impossibly-aged Lanceloto Malocello).[15] This Lanzarote made an attempt to seize the islands and is reported to have engaged in fighting with \\"Guanches and Castilians\\" there.[16]\\r\\nThere are several other expeditions, since determined to be apocryphal.[17] Among those deemed purely legendary are:\\r\\nOther legendary traditions include the apparition of the Virgin of Candelaria in 1392-93, encountered by two Guanches on the beaches of Tenerife.[23]\\r\\nIn the 14th century, a variety of forces competed for control of the Canaries: Genoese, Catalan-Mallorcan, Castilian, and Portuguese. In the following century, Castile and Portugal were the primary contenders.\\r\\nThe conquest took place between 1402 and 1496. It was not an easy task, militarily, given the resistance of the Guanche aboriginals in some islands. Nor was it easy politically, given the conflicting interests of the nobility (bent on fortifying their economic and political power) and the state, particularly Castile, with an interest in reinforcing its own power in competition with the nobles.\\r\\nHistorians identify two distinguishable periods in the conquest of the Canaries:\\r\\nThe first period of the conquest of the Canaries was carried out by the Norman nobles Jean de Bethencourt and Gadifer de la Salle. Their motives were basically economic: Bethencourt possessed textile factories and dye works and the Canaries offered a source of dyes such as the orchil lichen.\\r\\nBethencourt received important political support in the court of King Henry III of Castile. His uncle, Robert de Braquemont, gained the king's permission for the conquest of the Canary Islands on behalf of the Norman noble. In exchange for these rights Bethencourt became a vassal of the Castilian King. Robert de Braquemont invested a significant amount in the venture. The story of the Bethencourt Conquest was recorded in the chronicle known as the Canarien, compiled by two clerics Pierre Bontier and Jean Le Verrier. The original was adapted in two later versions, one by Gadifer de La Salle (which appears the more reliable of the two) and the other by the nephew of Bethencourt, Maciot de Bethencourt.\\r\\nThe Norman expedition set off from La Rochelle and stopped off in Galicia and Cdiz before arriving in Lanzarote in the summer of 1402. The island's aborigines and their chief Guadarfia were unable to resist the invading forces and surrendered. The Normans established themselves on the south of the island where they constructed a fortress and founded the Bishopric of Rubicon. From this location they attempted an assault on Fuerteventura.\\r\\nThis campaign lasted between 1402 and 1405. The extended duration was not due so much to the resistance of the islanders as to the difficulties and internal divisions between the two captains leading the invaders. Hunger and a lack of resources forced the expedition to retreat to Lanzarote. Jean de Bethencourt then travelled to Castila to drum up further support. There King Enrique III supplied the necessary measures and the confirmation of Bethencourt's exclusive rights to conquer the island, thereby marginalising Gadifer.\\r\\nDuring Bethencourt's absence Gadifer had to confront a double rebellion, one by a section of his men led by Bertn de Berneval, who had restarted the capture of slaves and the other by the Lanzarote guanches who resisted this practice. Pacifying the island took until 1404 and the conquest of Fuerteventura recommenced at the end of that year. However, the two commanders acted separately, each one fortifying his own domain (the castles of Rico Roque and Valtarajal). The conquest of the island was completed in 1405 with the surrender of the native kings of the island. On an unknown date Gadifer abandoned the island and returned to France to defend his rights, but he would never return to the islands.\\r\\nAfter the victory Bethencourt, absolute owner of the islands, returned to Normandy in search of settlers and new resources in order to continue the conquest of the rest of the islands.\\r\\nThe conquest of El Hierro took place in 1405. There was no resistance offered by the scattered guanche population who were largely sold as slaves. The island was then repopulated with Norman and Castilian settlers.\\r\\nBethencourt remained on the islands until 1412 when he returned permanently to his lands in Normandy, leaving Maciot de Bethencourt in charge of his possessions.\\r\\nThe Bethencourt era ended in 1418[citation needed] when Maciot sold his holdings and the rights to subjugate the remaining islands to Enrique Prez de Guzmn. From this point on the intervention of the King of Castile increased. Between 1418 and 1445 dominion over the islands changed hands on a number of occasions. Finally, control over the conquered islands and the right to further conquests fell to Hernn Peraza The Elder and his children Guilln Peraza and Ins Peraza. The death of Guilln Peraza in the attack on La Palma has been immortalized in a moving lament. After the death of her brother Ins and her husband Diego Garca de Herrera became the sole rulers of the islands until 1477 when they ceded La Gomera to their son Hernn Peraza The Younger and the rights to the conquest of La Palma, Gran Canaria and Tenerife to the King of Castile.\\r\\nThe island of La Gomera was not taken in battle but was incorporated into the Peraza-Herrera fiefdom through an agreement between Hernn Peraza The Elder and some of the insular aboriginal groups who accepted the rule of the Castilian. However, there were a number of uprisings by the guanches due to outrages committed by the rulers on the native Gomeros. The last one, in 1488 caused the death of the islands ruler, Hernn Peraza, whose widow, Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio, had to seek the assistance of Pedro de Vera, conqueror of Gran Canaria, in order to snuff out the rebellion. The subsequent repression caused the death of two hundred rebels and many others were sold into slavery in the Spanish markets.\\r\\nThe second period of the Spanish conquest of the Canaries was different from the first in a number of ways:\\r\\nThere were three stages in the conquest of Gran Canaria: a) Initial stage, June ÿ December 1478. The first expeditionary force disembarked on La Isleta on 24 June 1478. The force was commanded by Juan Rej܇n and Dean Berm~dez, as representative of the Bishop of San Marcial del Rubic܇n, Juan de Fras, who was a co-financier of the expedition. They founded Real de La Palmas near to Barranco de Guiniguada on the site of the present day Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. A few days later the first battle of the campaign took place near to Real when the islanders were defeated. This initial victory gave the Castilians control of the north east corner of the island.\\r\\nb) Guanche resistance and Castilian divisions from the close of 1478 until 1481. This period is defined by aboriginal resistance in the mountainous interior, the lack of men and materials and internal disputes between the invaders. During this stage Juan Rej܇n was dismissed on the orders of the Catholic Monarchs. His place was taken by Pedro Fernndez de Algaba who was subsequently executed by order of the deposed Rej܇n. The naming of Pedro de Vera as the new governor of the island and the arrest of Juan Rej܇n put an end to the in-fighting that had continued until 1481.\\r\\nc) Suppression of the guanche resistance and conquest of the island, 1481ÿ83. Pedro de Vera, now undisputed commander of the Castilian forces, resumed the conquest of the island's interior and the guanche fiefdom of Gldar. He was able to do this because a large contingent of reinforcements had been sent from Gomero by Diego Garca de Herrera. The guanche leader Doramas was subsequently killed in the Battle of Arucas. The capture of Tenesor Semidn, king of Gldar, by Alonso Fernndez de Lugo was a decisive factor in the victory of the invaders. Tenesor Semidn was sent to Castile where he was baptized with the name Fernando Guanarteme and after signing the Calatayud Pact with Fernando the Catholic he became a loyal and valuable ally of the Castilians. His actions have been interpreted in a number of ways throughout history: some think he was a traitor to the aboriginal cause; while others feel he was an able negotiator who saved many lives. On 29 April 1483 Guayarmina Semidn, considered to be queen of Gran Canaria, surrendered at Ansite Fortress. On the same day Chief Benteju and his shaman-advisor Faycn committed suicide by jumping off a cliff while shouting Atis Tirma (for my land).[24]\\r\\nAlonso Fernndez de Lugo, who played an important role in the conquest of Gran Canaria was granted the rights of conquest for La Palma and Tenerife by the Catholic Monarchs. The agreement with the Crown included a fifth of the captives and 700,000 maraveds if the conquest was completed within a year.\\r\\nIn order to finance the enterprise Alonso Fernndez de Lugo entered into association with Juanoto Berardi and Francisco de Riberol. Each partner contributed a third of the costs and would receive the same proportion of the benefits.\\r\\nThe campaign was relatively easy, commencing on 29 September 1492 when the Castilians landed in Tazacorte. Alonso Fernndez de Lugo made use of agreements and pacts with the guanches which respected the rights of the chieftains giving full equality with the Castillians in order to attract them to his cause. Resistance was generally minimal, with the exception of an incident in Tigalate. However, there was more concerted resistance in the canton of Acer܇ (Caldera de Taburiente) where the chief, Tanaus~, was easily able to hold out as the only two access points to the area were readily defendable against the advance of the invading forces.\\r\\nSeeing that the year would soon be up and fearing that he would lose the bonus of 700,000 maravedes Fernndez de Lugo proposed a meeting with Tanaus~ which was to take place in Los Llanos de Aridane. The Castilians ambushed and captured Tanaus~ when he left the Caldera. He was then sent to Castile as a prisoner, however, he starved to death on the journey. The official date for the end of the conquest is given as 3 May 1493. Following this part of the population of Acer܇ and other cantons which had signed peace treaties were sold as slaves although the majority were integrated into the new society formed after the conquest.\\r\\nTenerife was the last island to be conquered and the one that took the longest time to submit to the Castilian troops. Although the traditional dates of conquest of Tenerife are established between 1494 (landing of Alonso Fernndez de Lugo) and 1496 (conquest of the island), it must be taken into account that the attempts to annex the island of Tenerife to the Crown of Castile date back at least to 1464.[25] For this reason, from the first attempt to conquer the island in 1464, until it is finally conquered in 1496, 32 years pass.\\r\\nIn 1464, takes place in the barranco del Bufadero taking symbolic possession of the island by the Lord of the Canary Islas Diego Garcia de Herrera. This signing a peace treaty with menceyes, allowing shortly after mencey Anaga build a tower on their land, where Guanches and Europeans had treatment until it is demolished around 1472 by the same Guanches.[25]\\r\\nIn 1492 the governor of Gran Canaria Francisco Maldonado organizes a raid ending in disaster for Europe, as they are defeated by the Guanches of Anaga.\\r\\nIn December 1493 Alonso Fernndez de Lugo obtained the Catholic Monarchs confirmation of his right of conquest over the island of Tenerife and in exchange for renouncing the bonus promised for the conquest of La Palma he claimed governorship of the island, although he would not receive revenue from the quinto real tax.\\r\\nThe finance for the conquest was achieved by the sale of his sugar plantations in the valley of Agaete, obtained after the conquest of Gran Canaria, and by forming an association with Italian merchants who had settled in Seville.\\r\\nAt the time of the conquest Tenerife was divided into nine Menceyatos or kingdoms which can be divided into two camps, one largely in favour of the Castilians and the other opposed to them. The former which became known in Spanish as el bando de paz, comprised the peoples of the south and east of the island (from the menceyatos of Anaga, Gmar, Abone and Adeje) who had previous contact with Castilians through the activities of the missionary Candelaria. The opposing bando de guerra was based in the menceyatos of the north: Tegueste, Tacoronte, Taoro, Icoden and Daute and maintained a fierce resistance to the invasion.\\r\\nThe invading force set sail from Gran Canaria in April 1494 and landed on the coast of present-day Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The force comprised 2,000-foot soldiers and 200 cavalry made up of peninsular Castilians as well as soldiers from the other Canary Islands (mainly from Gomera and Gran Canary). After building a fortress they advanced towards the interior of the island. They tried to negotiate with Bencomo, the most important king in the bando de guerra, and offered peace if he accepted Christianity and submitted to the authority of the Catholic Monarchs. Bencomo rejected the conditions attached to the offer making confrontation inevitable.\\r\\nThe first armed encounter between the two sides was the celebrated First Battle of Acentejo that took place in a ravine called the Barranco de Acentejo or Barranco de San Antonio in the present day municipality of La Matanza de Acentejo. A force of more than 2,000 men advanced towards the north of the island through the valley of Taoro. The objective was to defeat the Guanches in the centre of their heartland. The guanches ambushed the invaders who suffered a grave defeat, losing eighty percent of their forces in the battle. Alonso Fernndez de Lugo managed to escape to Gran Canaria where he organized a new force with better trained troops and greater financial resources supported by Genoese merchants and Castilian nobles. After the battle the guanches destroyed the fortress built by the Castilians.\\r\\nWith a better trained and armed force Alonso Fernndez de Lugo returned to Tenerife. After rebuilding the fortress at A?azo he advanced towards the plains of Aguere (San Crist܇bal de La Laguna) where in November he defeated Bencomo in the Battle of Aguere as the gaunche leader committed the error of engaging the Castillian forces in battle in open ground. The use of cavalry and reinforcements provided by Fernando Guanarteme were the deciding factors in the Castillian victory. The guanches lost 1,700 men including Bencomo and his brother (or possibly stepbrother) Tinguaro. It is claimed that an epidemic had infected the population before the battle, decimating the island's population and leaving the survivors weak or ill, this is known as the \\"gran modorra\\" or the great drowsiness. However, the exact size of the epidemic and its importance in the outcome of the battle remains disputed by some historians.\\r\\nIn December 1495, after a long period of guerrilla warfare, pillaging and war fatigue the Castilians again advanced on the interior in the direction of Taoro, this time from the north. A force of several thousand guanches awaited them in a ravine near to the present day municipality of La Victoria de Acentejo, not far from the site of the First Battle of Acentejo. The Castilian victory in the Second Battle of Acentejo brought about the collapse of aboriginal resistance and access to the Taoro Valley remained open. The battle marked the conquest of the island of Tenerife and the end of the conquest of the Canary Islands.","input":"When did spain take over the canary islands?"},{"output":"De La Hoya","context":"Julio Csar Chvez vs. Oscar De La Hoya, billed as \\"Ultimate Glory\\", was a professional boxing match contested on June 7, 1996 for the WBC and lineal super lightweight championship.    \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter both Julio Csar Chvez and Oscar De La Hoya defeated their opponents (Scott Walker and Darryl Tyson respectively) in tune-up bouts on February 9, 1996, the two fighters agreed to face one another in a \\"dream match\\" set for June of that year. The undefeated De La Hoya had already won world titles in two divisions and was looking to capture a third world title in a third weight class at only 23ÿyears old. The 33ÿyear old Chavez, meanwhile, was entering his 100th fight and still possessed one of the most impressive records in boxing history, having gone 97ÿ1ÿ1 and capturing four world titles in three divisions in his 16ÿyear career.[1] The bout was highly anticipated, with some even calling the biggest fight in Latino boxing history and both fighters taking home a thenÿcareer high $9 million purse.[2] Despite his vast experience advantage over De La Hoya (who had only partaken in 21 pro fights up to that point) and his status as champion, the aging Chavez was initially installed as a 3ÿ1 underdog before odds were dropped to 2ÿ1 by the time of the fight. Though both fighters were of Mexican heritage, most Mexican and MexicanÿAmerican fans favored Chavez as De La Hoya had been born in the United States. In promotional stops for their fight, De La Hoya was largely booed by the largely Hispanic populations of Phoenix, San Diego and even his native Los Angeles.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nA controversial decision was made prior to the fight as De La Hoya's promoter Bob Arum refused to let the fight be carried on Pay-per-view and instead opted for it to be shown almost exclusively on closed-circuit television, severely limiting the highly anticipated bouts audience. Arum claimed that he made the decision to combat the use of illegal \\"black boxes\\", which steal pay-per-view signals and allow its users to watch the program for free. Though Arum claimed that the fight would net somewhere between $60 to $90 million even without pay-per-view, the fight drew a somewhat disappointing crowd of 750,000, down from the 1.7 million fans Arum had expected, and fell well short of his expected earnings, with the fight grossing around $14 million.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fight lasted less than four rounds. Only one minute into round one, De La Hoya connected with a straight right hand that opened up a huge gash around Chavez' eye. The fight was temporally halted not even a minute later as the cut had become severe enough for the referee Joe Cortez to stop the action and allow Chavez to find a towel. Though Chavez was able to continue, he was unable to get any momentum and was dominated by De La Hoya for the remainder of the fight. In round four, as Chavez was finally mounting some offense, De La Hoya took control of the latter stages of the round and brutalized Chavez with a series of hard combinations and broke Chavez' nose with a left hook. As the cut around his eye had deteriorated even further, Cortez halted the fight once again and sent him to ringside physician Flip Homansky. Homansky then informed Cortez that Chavez could not continue due to the multiple lacerations to his face and De La Hoya was awarded with the TKO victory at 2:37 of the fourth round[6]","input":"Who won the chavez de la hoya fight?"},{"output":"Over 3,500","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nMosquitoes[a] are small, midge-like flies that constitute the family Culicidae. Females of most species are ectoparasites, whose tube-like mouthparts (called a proboscis) pierce the hosts' skin to consume blood. The word \\"mosquito\\" (formed by mosca and diminutive -ito)[2] is Spanish for \\"little fly\\".[3]  Thousands of species feed on the blood of various kinds of hosts, mainly vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and even some kinds of fish. Some mosquitoes also attack invertebrates, mainly other arthropods. Though the loss of blood is seldom of any importance to the victim, the saliva of the mosquito often causes an irritating rash that can be a nuisance. Much more serious, though, is the role of many species of mosquitoes as vectors of diseases. In passing from host to host, some transmit extremely harmful infections such as malaria, yellow fever, Chikungunya, West Nile virus, dengue fever, filariasis, Zika virus and other arboviruses, rendering the Culicidae the deadliest animal family in the world.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest known mosquito with an anatomy similar to modern species was found in 79-million-year-old Canadian amber from the Cretaceous.[7] An older sister species with more primitive features was found in Burmese amber that is 90 to 100 million years old.[8] Two mosquito fossils have been found that show very little morphological change in modern mosquitoes against their counterpart from 46 million years ago.[9]  These fossils are also the oldest ever found to have blood preserved within their abdomens.[10][11] Despite no fossils being found earlier than the Cretaceous, recent studies suggest that the earliest divergence of mosquitoes between the lineages leading to Anophelinae and Culicinae occurred 226 million years ago.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Old and New World Anopheles species are believed to have subsequently diverged about 95 million years ago.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mosquito Anopheles gambiae is currently undergoing speciation into the M(opti) and S(avanah) molecular forms. Consequently, some pesticides that work on the M form no longer work on the S form.[14]\\r\\nOver 3,500 species of the Culicidae have already been described.[15] They are generally divided into two subfamilies which in turn comprise some 43 genera. These figures are subject to continual change, as more species are discovered, and as DNA studies compel rearrangement of the taxonomy of the family. The two main subfamilies are the Anophelinae and Culicinae, with their genera as shown in the subsection below.[16] The distinction is of great practical importance because the two subfamilies tend to differ in their significance as vectors of different classes of diseases. Roughly speaking, arboviral diseases such as yellow fever and dengue fever tend to be transmitted by Culicine species, not necessarily in the genus Culex. Some transmit various species of avian malaria, but it is not clear that they ever transmit any form of human malaria. Some species do however transmit various forms of filariasis, much as many Simuliidae do.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnopheline mosquitoes, again not necessarily in the genus Anopheles, sometimes bear pathogenic arboviruses, but it is not yet clear that they ever transmit them as effective vectors. However, all the most important vectors of human malaria are Anopheline.[clarification needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMosquitoes are members of a family of nematocerid flies: the Culicidae (from the Latin culex, genitive culicis, meaning \\"midge\\" or \\"gnat\\").[17] Superficially, mosquitoes resemble crane flies (family Tipulidae) and chironomid flies (family Chironomidae). In particular, the females of many species of mosquitoes are blood-eating pests and dangerous vectors of diseases, whereas members of the similar-looking Chironomidae and Tipulidae are not. Many species of mosquitoes are not blood eaters and of those that are, many create a \\"high to low pressure\\" in the blood to obtain it and do not transmit disease. Also, in the bloodsucking species, only the females suck blood.[18] Furthermore, even among mosquitoes that do carry important diseases, neither all species of mosquitoes, nor all strains of a given species transmit the same kinds of diseases, nor do they all transmit the diseases under the same circumstances; their habits differ. For example, some species attack people in houses, and others prefer to attack people walking in forests. Accordingly, in managing public health, knowing which species or even which strain of mosquito one is dealing with is important.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 3,500 species of mosquitoes have already been described from various parts of the world.[19][20] Some mosquitoes that bite humans routinely act as vectors for a number of infectious diseases affecting millions of people per year.[21][22] Others that do not routinely bite humans, but are the vectors for animal diseases, may become disastrous agents for zoonosis of new diseases when their habitats are disturbed, for instance by sudden deforestation.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike all flies, mosquitoes go through four stages in their lifecycles: egg, larva, pupa, and adult or imago. In most species, adult females lay their eggs in stagnant water; some lay eggs near the water's edge; others attach their eggs to aquatic plants. Each species selects the situation of the water into which it lays its eggs and does so according to its own ecological adaptations. Some are generalists and are not very fussy. Some breed in lakes, some in temporary puddles. Some breed in marshes, some in salt-marshes. Among those that breed in salt water, some are equally at home in fresh and salt water up to about one-third the concentration of seawater, whereas others must acclimatize themselves to the salinity.[25] Such differences are important because certain ecological preferences keep mosquitoes away from most humans, whereas other preferences bring them right into houses at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome species of mosquitoes prefer to breed in phytotelmata (natural reservoirs on plants), such as rainwater accumulated in holes in tree trunks, or in the leaf-axils of bromeliads. Some specialize in the liquid in pitchers of particular species of pitcher plants, their larvae feeding on decaying insects that had drowned there or on the associated bacteria; the genus Wyeomyia provides such examples  the harmless Wyeomyia smithii breeds only in the pitchers of Sarracenia purpurea.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, some of the species of mosquitoes that are adapted to breeding in phytotelmata are dangerous disease vectors. In nature, they might occupy anything from a hollow tree trunk to a cupped leaf. Such species typically take readily to breeding in artificial water containers. Such casual puddles are important breeding places for some of the most serious disease vectors, such as species of Aedes that transmit dengue and yellow fever. Some with such breeding habits are disproportionately important vectors because they are well-placed to pick up pathogens from humans and pass them on. In contrast, no matter how voracious, mosquitoes that breed and feed mainly in remote wetlands and salt marshes may well remain uninfected, and if they do happen to become infected with a relevant pathogen, might seldom encounter humans to infect, in turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first three stagesegg, larva, and pupaare largely aquatic. These stages typically last 5 to 14 days, depending on the species and the ambient temperature, but there are important exceptions. Mosquitoes living in regions where some seasons are freezing or waterless spend part of the year in diapause; they delay their development, typically for months, and carry on with life only when there is enough water or warmth for their needs. For instance, Wyeomyia larvae typically get frozen into solid lumps of ice during winter and only complete their development in spring. The eggs of some species of Aedes remain unharmed in diapause if they dry out, and hatch later when they are covered by water.\\r\\n\\r\\nEggs hatch to become larvae, which grow until they are able to change into pupae. The adult mosquito emerges from the mature pupa as it floats at the water surface. Bloodsucking mosquitoes, depending on species, sex, and weather conditions, have potential adult lifespans ranging from as short as a week to as long as several months.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome species can overwinter as adults in diapause.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nMosquito habits of oviposition, the ways in which they lay their eggs, vary considerably between species, and the morphologies of the eggs vary accordingly. The simplest procedure is that followed by many species of Anopheles; like many other gracile species of aquatic insects, females just fly over the water, bobbing up and down to the water surface and dropping eggs more or less singly. The bobbing behavior occurs among some other aquatic insects as well, for example mayflies and dragonflies; it is sometimes called \\"dapping\\". The eggs of Anopheles species are roughly cigar-shaped and have floats down their sides. Females of many common species can lay 100ÿ200 eggs during the course of the adult phase of their lifecycles. Even with high egg and intergenerational mortality, over a period of several weeks, a single successful breeding pair can create a population of thousands.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome other species, for example members of the genus Mansonia, lay their eggs in arrays, attached usually to the under-surfaces of waterlily pads. Their close relatives, the genus Coquillettidia, lay their eggs similarly, but not attached to plants. Instead, the eggs form layers called \\"rafts\\" that float on the water. This is a common mode of oviposition, and most species of Culex are known for the habit, which also occurs in some other genera, such as Culiseta and Uranotaenia. Anopheles eggs may on occasion cluster together on the water, too, but the clusters do not generally look much like compactly glued rafts of eggs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn species that lay their eggs in rafts, rafts do not form adventitiously; the female Culex settles carefully on still water with its hind legs crossed, and as it lays the eggs one by one, it twitches to arrange them into a head-down array that sticks together to form the raft.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nAedes females generally drop their eggs singly, much as Anopheles do, but not as a rule into water. Instead, they lay their eggs on damp mud or other surfaces near the water's edge. Such an oviposition site commonly is the wall of a cavity such as a hollow stump or a container such as a bucket or a discarded vehicle tire. The eggs generally do not hatch until they are flooded, and they may have to withstand considerable desiccation before that happens. They are not resistant to desiccation straight after oviposition, but must develop to a suitable degree first. Once they have achieved that, however, they can enter diapause for several months if they dry out. Clutches of eggs of the majority of mosquito species hatch as soon as possible, and all the eggs in the clutch hatch at much the same time. In contrast, a batch of Aedes eggs in diapause tends to hatch irregularly over an extended period of time. This makes it much more difficult to control such species than those mosquitoes whose larvae can be killed all together as they hatch. Some Anopheles species do also behave in such a manner, though not to the same degree of sophistication.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mosquito larva has a well-developed head with mouth brushes used for feeding, a large thorax with no legs, and a segmented abdomen.\\r\\n\\r\\nLarvae breathe through spiracles located on their eighth abdominal segments, or through a siphon, so must come to the surface frequently. The larvae spend most of their time feeding on algae, bacteria, and other microbes in the surface microlayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey dive below the surface only when disturbed. Larvae swim either through propulsion with their mouth brushes, or by jerky movements of their entire bodies, giving them the common name of \\"wigglers\\" or \\"wrigglers\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nLarvae develop through four stages, or instars, after which they metamorphose into pupae. At the end of each instar, the larvae molt, shedding their skins to allow for further growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMosquito larvae and pupa resting at water surface\\r\\n\\r\\nAnopheles larva from southern Germany, about 8?mm long\\r\\n\\r\\nAedes aegypti larva\\r\\n\\r\\nCulex larva and pupa\\r\\n\\r\\nCulex larvae plus one pupa\\r\\n\\r\\nElectron micrograph of a mosquito egg\\r\\n\\r\\nAs seen in its lateral aspect, the mosquito pupa is comma-shaped. The head and thorax are merged into a cephalothorax, with the abdomen curving around underneath. The pupa can swim actively by flipping its abdomen, and it is commonly called a \\"tumbler\\" because of its swimming action. As with the larva, the pupa of most species must come to the surface frequently to breathe, which they do through a pair of respiratory trumpets on their cephalothoraxes. However, pupae do not feed during this stage; typically they pass their time hanging from the surface of the water by their respiratory trumpets. If alarmed, say by a passing shadow, they nimbly swim downwards by flipping their abdomens in much the same way as the larvae do. If undisturbed, they soon float up again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few days or longer, depending on the temperature and other circumstances, the pupa rises to the water surface, the dorsal surface of its cephalothorax splits, and the adult mosquito emerges. The pupa is less active than the larva because it does not feed, whereas the larva feeds constantly.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period of development from egg to adult varies among species and is strongly influenced by ambient temperature. Some species of mosquitoes can develop from egg to adult in as few as five days, but a more typical period of development in tropical conditions would be some 40 days or more for most species. The variation of the body size in adult mosquitoes depends on the density of the larval population and food supply within the breeding water.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdult mosquitoes usually mate within a few days after emerging from the pupal stage. In most species, the males form large swarms, usually around dusk, and the females fly into the swarms to mate.\\r\\n\\r\\nMales typically live for about 5ÿ7 days, feeding on nectar and other sources of sugar. After obtaining a full blood meal, the female will rest for a few days while the blood is digested and eggs are developed. This process depends on the temperature, but usually takes two to three days in tropical conditions. Once the eggs are fully developed, the female lays them and resumes host-seeking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cycle repeats itself until the female dies. While females can live longer than a month in captivity, most do not live longer than one to two weeks in nature. Their lifespans depend on temperature, humidity, and their ability to successfully obtain a blood meal while avoiding host defenses and predators.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe length of the adult is typically between 3mm and 6mm.  The smallest known mosquitoes are around 2?mm (0.1?in), and the largest around 19?mm (0.7?in).[31]  Mosquitoes typically weigh around 5?mg. All mosquitoes have slender bodies with three segments: a head, a thorax and an abdomen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head is specialized for receiving sensory information and for feeding. It has eyes and a pair of long, many-segmented antennae. The antennae are important for detecting host odors, as well as odors of breeding sites where females lay eggs. In all mosquito species, the antennae of the males in comparison to the females are noticeably bushier and contain auditory receptors to detect the characteristic whine of the females.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe compound eyes are distinctly separated from one another. Their larvae only possess a pit-eye ocellus. The compound eyes of adults develop in a separate region of the head.[32] New ommatidia are added in semicircular rows at the rear of the eye. During the first phase of growth, this leads to individual ommatidia being square, but later in development they become hexagonal. The hexagonal pattern will only become visible when the carapace of the stage with square eyes is molted.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head also has an elongated, forward-projecting, stinger-like proboscis used for feeding, and two sensory palps. The maxillary palps of the males are longer than their proboscises, whereas the females maxillary palps are much shorter. In typical bloodsucking species, the female has an elongated proboscis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thorax is specialized for locomotion. Three pairs of legs and a pair of wings are attached to the thorax. The insect wing is an outgrowth of the exoskeleton. The Anopheles mosquito can fly for up to four hours continuously at 1?to 2?km/h (0.6ÿ1?mph),[33] traveling up to 12?km (7.5?mi) in a night. Males beat their wings between 450 and 600 times per second.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe abdomen is specialized for food digestion and egg development; the abdomen of a mosquito can hold three times its own weight in blood.[35] This segment expands considerably when a female takes a blood meal. The blood is digested over time, serving as a source of protein for the production of eggs, which gradually fill the abdomen.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypically, both male and female mosquitoes feed on nectar and plant juices, but in many species the mouthparts of the females are adapted for piercing the skin of animal hosts and sucking their blood as ectoparasites. In many species, the female needs to obtain nutrients from a blood meal before it can produce eggs, whereas in many other species, it can produce more eggs after a blood meal. A mosquito has a variety of ways of finding its prey, including chemical, visual, and heat sensors.[36] Both plant materials and blood are useful sources of energy in the form of sugars, and blood also supplies more concentrated nutrients, such as lipids, but the most important function of blood meals is to obtain proteins as materials for egg production.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe feeding preferences of mosquitoes include those with type O blood, heavy breathers, those with a lot of skin bacteria, people with a lot of body heat, and the pregnant.[37][38] Individuals' attractiveness to mosquitoes also has a heritable, genetically-controlled component.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a female reproduces without such parasitic meals, it is said to practice autogenous reproduction, as in Toxorhynchites; otherwise, the reproduction may be termed anautogenous, as occurs in mosquito species that serve as disease vectors, particularly Anopheles and some of the most important disease vectors in the genus Aedes. In contrast, some mosquitoes, for example, many Culex, are partially anautogenous: they do not need a blood meal for their first cycle of egg production, which they produce autogenously; however, subsequent clutches of eggs are produced anautogenously, at which point their disease vectoring activity becomes operative.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nFemale mosquitoes hunt their blood host by detecting organic substances such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and 1-octen-3-ol produced from the host, and through visual recognition. Mosquitoes prefer some people over others. The preferred victim's sweat simply smells better than others' because of the proportions of the carbon dioxide, octenol and other compounds that make up body odor.[41] The most powerful semiochemical that triggers the keen sense of smell of Culex quinquefasciatus is nonanal.[42] Another compound identified in human blood that attracts mosquitoes is sulcatone or 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, especially for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with the odor receptor gene Or4.[43] A large part of the mosquitos sense of smell, or olfactory system, is devoted to sniffing out blood sources. Of 72 types of odor receptors on its antennae, at least 27 are tuned to detect chemicals found in perspiration.[44] In Aedes, the search for a host takes place in two phases. First, the mosquito exhibits a nonspecific searching behavior until the perception of host stimulants, then it follows a targeted approach.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost mosquito species are crepuscular (dawn or dusk) feeders. During the heat of the day, most mosquitoes rest in a cool place and wait for the evenings, although they may still bite if disturbed.[46] Some species, such as the Asian tiger mosquito, are known to fly and feed during daytime.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to and during blood feeding, blood-sucking mosquitoes inject saliva into the bodies of their source(s) of blood. This saliva serves as an anticoagulant; without it the female mosquito's proboscis might become clogged with blood clots. The saliva also is the main route by which mosquito physiology offers passenger pathogens access to the hosts' bloodstream. The salivary glands are a major target to most pathogens, whence they find their way into the host via the saliva.\\r\\n\\r\\nA mosquito bite often leaves an itchy weal, a raised bump, on the victim's skin, which is caused by histamines trying to fight off the protein left by the attacking insect.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nMosquitoes of the genus Toxorhynchites never drink blood.[49] This genus includes the largest extant mosquitoes, the larvae of which prey on the larvae of other mosquitoes. These mosquito eaters have been used in the past as mosquito control agents, with varying success.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany, if not all, blood-sucking species of mosquitoes are fairly selective feeders that specialise in particular host species, though they often relax their selectivity when they experience severe competition for food, defensive activity on the part of the hosts, or starvation. Some species feed selectively on monkeys, while others prefer particular kinds of birds, but they become less selective as conditions become more difficult. For example, Culiseta melanura sucks the blood of passerine birds for preference, and such birds are typically the main reservoir of the Eastern equine encephalitis virus in North America. Early in the season while mosquito numbers are low, they concentrate on passerine hosts, but as mosquito numbers rise and the birds are forced to defend themselves more vigorously, the mosquitoes become less selective of hosts. Soon the mosquitoes begin attacking mammals more readily, thereby becoming the major vector of the virus, and causing epidemics of the disease, most conspicuously in humans and horses.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nEven more dramatically, in most of its range in North America, the main vector for the Western equine encephalitis virus is Culex tarsalis, because it is known to feed variously on mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Even fish may be attacked by some mosquito species if they expose themselves above water level, as mudskippers do.[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome species of blood-sucking flies, such as many of the Ceratopogonidae, will attack large, live insects and suck their haemolymph[53] and others, such as the so-called \\"jackal flies\\" (Milichiidae), will attack the recently dead prey of say, crab spiders (Thomisidae).[54] In 1969 it was reported that some species of anautogenous mosquitoes would feed on the haemolymph of caterpillars.[55] Other observations include mosquitoes feeding on cicadas[56] and mantids.[57] In 2014 it was shown that malaria-transmitting mosquitoes actively seek out some species of caterpillars and feed on their haemolymph,[58] and do so to the caterpillar's apparent physical detriment.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nMosquito mouthparts are very specialized, particularly those of the females, which in most species are adapted to piercing skin and then sucking blood. Apart from bloodsucking, the females generally also drink assorted fluids rich in dissolved sugar, such as nectar and honeydew, to obtain the energy they need. For this, their blood-sucking mouthparts are perfectly adequate. In contrast, male mosquitoes are not bloodsuckers; they only drink sugary fluids. Accordingly, their mouthparts do not require the same degree of specialization as those of females.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nExternally, the most obvious feeding structure of the mosquito is the proboscis. More specifically, the visible part of the proboscis is the labium, which forms the sheath enclosing the rest of the mouthparts. When the mosquito first lands on a potential host, its mouthparts are enclosed entirely in this sheath, and it will touch the tip of the labium to the skin in various places. Sometimes, it will begin to bite almost straight away, while other times, it will prod around, apparently looking for a suitable place. Occasionally, it will wander for a considerable time, and eventually fly away without biting. Presumably, this probing is a search for a place with easily accessible blood vessels, but the exact mechanism is not known. It is known that there are two taste receptors at the tip of the labium which may well play a role.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female mosquito does not insert its labium into the skin; it bends back into a bow when the mosquito begins to bite. The tip of the labium remains in contact with the skin of the victim, acting as a guide for the other mouthparts. In total, there are six mouthparts besides the labium: two mandibles, two maxillae, the hypopharynx, and the labrum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mandibles and the maxillae are used for piercing the skin. The mandibles are pointed, while the maxillae end in flat, toothed \\"blades\\". To force these into the skin, the mosquito moves its head backwards and forwards. On one movement, the maxillae are moved as far forward as possible. On the opposite movement, the mandibles are pushed deeper into the skin by levering against the maxillae. The maxillae do not slip back because the toothed blades grip the skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypopharynx and the labrum are both hollow. Saliva with anticoagulant is pumped down the hypopharynx to prevent clotting, and blood is drawn up the labrum.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo understand the mosquito mouthparts, it is helpful to draw a comparison with an insect that chews food, such as a dragonfly. A dragonfly has two mandibles, which are used for chewing, and two maxillae, which are used to hold the food in place as it is chewed. The labium forms the floor of the dragonfly's mouth, the labrum forms the top, while the hypopharynx is inside the mouth and is used in swallowing. Conceptually, then, the mosquito's proboscis is an adaptation of the mouthparts that occur in other insects. The labium still lies beneath the other mouthparts, but also enfolds them, and it has been extended into a proboscis. The maxillae still \\"grip\\" the \\"food\\" while the mandibles \\"bite\\" it. The top of the mouth, the labrum, has developed into a channeled blade the length of the proboscis, with a cross-section like an inverted \\"U\\". Finally, the hypopharynx has extended into a tube that can deliver saliva at the end of the proboscis. Its upper surface is somewhat flattened so, when pressed against it, the labrum forms a closed tube for conveying blood from the victim.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the mosquito to obtain a blood meal, it must circumvent the vertebrate's physiological responses. The mosquito, as with all blood-feeding arthropods, has mechanisms to effectively block the hemostasis system with their saliva, which contains a mixture of secreted proteins. Mosquito saliva acts to reduce vascular constriction, blood clotting, platelet aggregation, angiogenesis and immunity, and creates inflammation.[63] Universally, hematophagous arthropod saliva contains at least one anti-clotting, one anti-platelet, and one vasodilatory substance. Mosquito saliva also contains enzymes that aid in sugar feeding,[64] and antimicrobial agents to control bacterial growth in the sugar meal.[65] The composition of mosquito saliva is relatively simple, as it usually contains fewer than 20 dominant proteins.[66] As of the early 2000s[update], scientists still were unable to ascribe functions to more than half of the molecules found in arthropod saliva.[66] One promising application of components of mosquito saliva is the development of anti-clotting drugs, such as clotting inhibitors and capillary dilators, that could be useful for cardiovascular disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is now well recognized that feeding ticks, sandflies, and, more recently, mosquitoes, have an ability to modulate the immune response of the animals (hosts) on which they feed.[63] The presence of this activity in vector saliva is a reflection of the inherent overlapping and interconnected nature of the host hemostatic and inflammatory/immunological responses and the intrinsic need to prevent these host defenses from disrupting successful feeding. The mechanism for mosquito saliva-induced alteration of the host immune response is unclear, but the data have become increasingly convincing that such an effect occurs. Early work described a factor in saliva that directly suppresses TNF-ϫ release, but not antigen-induced histamine secretion, from activated mast cells.[67] Experiments by Cross et al. (1994) demonstrated that the inclusion of Ae. aegypti mosquito saliva into na?ve cultures led to a suppression of interleukin (IL)-2 and IFN- production, while the cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 are unaffected.[68] Cellular proliferation in response to IL-2 is clearly reduced by prior treatment of cells with mosquito salivary gland extract.[68] Correspondingly, activated splenocytes isolated from mice fed upon by either Ae. aegypti or Cx. pipiens mosquitoes produce markedly higher levels of IL-4 and IL-10 concurrent with suppressed IFN- production.[69] Unexpectedly, this shift in cytokine expression is observed in splenocytes up to 10 days after mosquito exposure, suggesting natural feeding of mosquitoes can have a profound, enduring, and systemic effect on the immune response.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nT cell populations are decidedly susceptible to the suppressive effect of mosquito saliva, showing increased mortality and decreased division rates.[70] Parallel work by Wasserman et al. (2004) demonstrated that T and B cell proliferation was inhibited in a dose dependent manner with concentrations as low as 1/7 of the saliva in a single mosquito.[71] Depinay et al. (2005) observed a suppression of antibody-specific T cell responses mediated by mosquito saliva and dependent on mast cells and IL-10 expression.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2006 study suggests mosquito saliva can also decrease expression of interferon?ϫ/ during early mosquito-borne virus infection.[73] The contribution of type I interferons (IFN) in recovery from infection with viruses has been demonstrated in vivo by the therapeutic and prophylactic effects of administration of IFN inducers or IFN itself,[74] and different research suggests mosquito saliva exacerbates West Nile virus infection,[75] as well as other mosquito-transmitted viruses.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies in humanized mice bearing a reconstituted human immune system have suggested potential impact of mosquito saliva in humans. Work published in 2018 from the Baylor College of Medicine using such humanized mice came to several conclusions, among them being that mosquito saliva led to an increase in natural killer T cells in peripheral blood; to an overall decrease in ex vivo cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); changes to proportions of subsets of PBMCs; changes in the prevalence of T cell subtypes across organs; and changes to circulating levels of cytokines.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nFemale mosquitoes use two very different food sources. They need sugar for energy, which is taken from sources such as nectar, and they need blood as a source of protein for egg development. Because biting is risky and suitable hosts may be difficult to find, mosquitoes take as much blood as possible when they have the opportunity.[citation needed] Digesting large volumes of blood takes time, requiring the use of energy from sugars during the feeding process.[citation needed] To avoid this problem, mosquitoes possess a digestive system which can store both food types, giving access to both as needed.[citation needed] When the mosquito drinks a sugar solution, it is directed to a crop. The crop can release sugar into the stomach as it is required. At the same time, the stomach never becomes full of sugar solution, which would prevent the mosquito taking a blood meal.[citation needed] Blood is directed straight into the mosquito's stomach. In species that feed on mammalian or avian blood, hosts whose blood pressure is high, the mosquito feeds selectively from active blood vessels, where the pressure assists in filling the gut rapidly.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon completion of feeding, the mosquito will withdraw her proboscis, and as the gut fills up, the stomach lining secretes a peritrophic membrane that surrounds the blood. This membrane keeps the blood separate from anything else in the stomach. However, like certain other insects that survive on dilute, purely liquid diets, notably many of the Hemiptera, many adult mosquitoes must excrete unwanted aqueous fractions even as they feed. (See the photograph of a feeding Anopheles stephensi: Note that the excreted droplet patently is not whole blood, being far more dilute). As long as they are not disturbed, this permits mosquitoes to continue feeding until they have accumulated a full meal of nutrient solids. As a result, a mosquito replete with blood can continue to absorb sugar, even as the blood meal is slowly digested over a period of several days.[61][78] Once blood is in the stomach, the midgut of the female synthesizes proteolytic enzymes that hydrolyze the blood proteins into free amino acids. These are used as building blocks for the synthesis of egg yolk proteins.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mosquito Anopheles stephensi Liston, trypsin activity is restricted entirely to the posterior midgut lumen. No trypsin activity occurs before the blood meal, but activity increases continuously up to 30 hours after feeding, and subsequently returns to baseline levels by 60 hours. Aminopeptidase is active in the anterior and posterior midgut regions before and after feeding. In the whole midgut, activity rises from a baseline of approximately three enzyme units (EU) per midgut to a maximum of 12 EU at 30 hours after the blood meal, subsequently falling to baseline levels by 60 hours. A similar cycle of activity occurs in the posterior midgut and posterior midgut lumen, whereas aminopeptidase in the posterior midgut epithelium decreases in activity during digestion. Aminopeptidase in the anterior midgut is maintained at a constant, low level, showing no significant variation with time after feeding. Alpha-glucosidase is active in anterior and posterior midguts before and at all times after feeding. In whole midgut homogenates, alpha-glucosidase activity increases slowly up to 18 hours after the blood meal, then rises rapidly to a maximum at 30 hours after the blood meal, whereas the subsequent decline in activity is less predictable. All posterior midgut activity is restricted to the posterior midgut lumen. Depending on the time after feeding, greater than 25% of the total midgut activity of alpha-glucosidase is located in the anterior midgut. After blood meal ingestion, proteases are active only in the posterior midgut. Trypsin is the major primary hydrolytic protease and is secreted into the posterior midgut lumen without activation in the posterior midgut epithelium. Aminoptidase activity is also luminal in the posterior midgut, but cellular aminopeptidases are required for peptide processing in both anterior and posterior midguts. Alpha-glucosidase activity is elevated in the posterior midgut after feeding in response to the blood meal, whereas activity in the anterior midgut is consistent with a nectar-processing role for this midgut region.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the sense of the entire family Culicidae, mosquitoes are cosmopolitan; in every land region except for Antarctica[61] and a few islands, mainly in polar or subpolar climates, at least some species of mosquito will be present. Iceland is such an island, being essentially free of mosquitoes.[80]  In warm and humid tropical regions, some mosquito species are active for the entire year, but in temperate and cold regions they hibernate or enter diapause. Arctic or subarctic mosquitoes, like some other arctic midges in families such as Simuliidae and Ceratopogonidae may be active for only a few weeks annually as melt-water pools form on the permafrost. During that time, though, they emerge in huge numbers in some regions and may take up to 300 ml of blood per day from each animal in a caribou herd.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe absence of mosquitoes from Iceland and similar regions is probably because of quirks of their climate, which differs in some respects from mainland regions. At the start of the uninterrupted continental winter of Greenland and the northern regions of Eurasia and America, the pupa enters diapause under the ice that covers sufficiently deep water. The imago ecloses only after the ice breaks in late spring. In Iceland however, the weather is less predictable. In mid-winter it frequently warms up suddenly, causing the ice to break, but then to freeze again after a few days. By that time the mosquitoes will have emerged from their pupae, but the new freeze sets in before they can complete their life cycle. Any anautogenous adult mosquito would need a host to supply a blood meal before it could lay viable eggs; it would need time to mate, mature the eggs and oviposit in suitable wetlands. These requirements would not be realistic in Iceland and in fact the absence of mosquitoes from such subpolar islands is in line with the islands' low biodiversity; Iceland has fewer than 1,500 described species of insects, many of them probably accidentally introduced by human agency. In Iceland most ectoparasitic insects live in sheltered conditions or actually on mammals; examples include lice, fleas and bedbugs, in whose living conditions freezing is no concern, and most of which were introduced inadvertently by humans.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome other aquatic Diptera, such as Simuliidae, do survive in Iceland, but their habits and adaptations differ from those of mosquitoes; Simuliidae for example, though they, like mosquitoes, are bloodsuckers, generally inhabit stones under running water that does not readily freeze and which is totally unsuited to mosquitoes; mosquitoes are generally not adapted to running water.[82][83]\\r\\n\\r\\nEggs of species of mosquitoes from the temperate zones are more tolerant of cold than the eggs of species indigenous to warmer regions.[84][85] Many even tolerate subzero temperatures. In addition, adults of some species can survive the winter by taking shelter in suitable microhabitats such as buildings or hollow trees.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nWorldwide introduction of various mosquito species over large distances into regions where they are not indigenous has occurred through human agencies, primarily on sea routes, in which the eggs, larvae, and pupae inhabiting water-filled used tires and cut flowers are transported. However, apart from sea transport, mosquitoes have been effectively carried by personal vehicles, delivery trucks, trains, and aircraft. Man-made areas such as storm water retention basins, or storm drains also provide sprawling sanctuaries. Sufficient quarantine measures have proven difficult to implement. In addition, outdoor pool areas make a perfect place for them to grow.\\r\\n\\r\\nMosquitoes can act as vectors for many disease-causing viruses and parasites. Infected mosquitoes carry these organisms from person to person without exhibiting symptoms themselves.[citation needed] Mosquito-borne diseases include:\\r\\n\\r\\nPotential transmission of HIV was originally a public health concern, but practical considerations and detailed studies of epidemiological patterns suggest that any transmission of the HIV virus by mosquitoes is at worst extremely unlikely.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious species of mosquitoes are estimated to transmit various types of disease to more than 700 million people annually in Africa, South America, Central America, Mexico, Russia, and much of Asia, with millions of resultant deaths. At least two million people annually die of these diseases, and the morbidity rates are many times higher still.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethods used to prevent the spread of disease, or to protect individuals in areas where disease is endemic, include:\\r\\n\\r\\nSince most such diseases are carried by \\"elderly\\" female mosquitoes, some scientists have suggested focusing on these to avoid the evolution of resistance.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nA recent study collected and identified 20,551 adult female mosquitoes in five neighborhoods of the city of Baltimore over 2 years. Most of these mosquitos (73%) were invasive Asian tiger mosquitoes (Aedes albopictus), but samples also included Culex (24%) and Aedes japonicus (2.4%) mosquitoes, both of which carry West Nile virus.  The hosts of these mosquitos were determined by isolating DNA from the former. Invasive brown rats made up 71.7% of all Asian tiger blood meals. By contrast, birds were the most common victims of Culex, while Aedes appears to avoid birds altogether. Humans and cats each made up 13.3 percent of Aedes blood meals, while deer and dogs were bitten less frequently by all mosquito species. Notably, the study showed that different neighborhoods in Baltimore had different abundances and composition of mosquito species, dependent on the abundance of neglected containers for mosquito breeding, and how people choose to spend time outside.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany measures have been tried for mosquito control, including the elimination of breeding places, exclusion via window screens and mosquito nets, biological control with parasites such as fungi[94][95] and nematodes,[96] or predators such as fish,[97][98][99] copepods,[100] dragonfly nymphs and adults, and some species of lizard and gecko.[101] Another approach is to introduce large numbers of sterile males.[102] Genetic methods including cytoplasmic incompatibility, chromosomal translocations, sex distortion and gene replacement have been explored. They are cheaper and not subject to vector resistance.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nInsect repellents are applied on skin and give short-term protection against mosquito bites. The chemical DEET repels some mosquitoes and other insects.[104] Some CDC-recommended repellents are picaridin, eucalyptus oil (PMD) and IR3535.[105] Others are indalone, dimethyl phthalate, dimethyl carbate, and ethyl hexanediol.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, researchers at New Mexico State University tested 10 commercially available products for their effectiveness at repelling mosquitoes.[106] On the mosquito Aedes aegypti, the vector of Zika virus, only one repellent that did not contain DEET had a strong effect for the duration of the 240 minutes test: a lemon eucalyptus oil repellent. All DEET-containing mosquito repellents were active.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also electronic insect repellent devices which produce ultrasounds that were developed to keep away insects (and mosquitoes). However, no scientific research based on the EPA's and many universities' studies has ever provided evidence that these devices prevent a human from being bitten by a mosquito.[107][108] In 2005, the British consumer magazine Holiday reported the results of its test of a range of mosquito deterrents. The magazine's editor Lorna Cowan described the four appliances that used a buzzer as \\"a shocking waste of money\\" which \\"should be removed from sale\\".[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nVisible, irritating bites are due to an immune response from the binding of IgG and IgE antibodies to antigens in the mosquito's saliva. Some of the sensitizing antigens are common to all mosquito species, whereas others are specific to certain species. There are both immediate hypersensitivity reactions (types I and III) and delayed hypersensitivity reactions (type IV) to mosquito bites.[110] Both reactions result in itching, redness and swelling. Immediate reactions develop within a few minutes of the bite and last for a few hours. Delayed reactions take around a day to develop, and last for up to a week.\\r\\nSeveral anti-itch medications are commercially available, including those taken orally, such as diphenhydramine, or topically applied antihistamines and, for more severe cases, corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone and triamcinolone. A common topical remedy in camping gear is aqueous ammonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAncient Greek beast fables including \\"The Elephant and the Mosquito\\" and \\"The Bull and the Mosquito\\", with the general moral that the large beast does not even notice the small one, derive ultimately from Mesopotamia.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nWinsor McCay's 1912 film How a Mosquito Operates was one of the earliest works of animation, far ahead of its time in technical quality.

Together, they make the busiest airport system in the world by passenger numbers and the second-busiest by aircraft movements.[1] In 2016, the six airports handled a total of 163,231,321 passengers. The London airports handle 60% of all the UK's air traffic. The airports serve a total of 14 domestic destinations and 396 international destinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocated in the London Borough of Newham, City Airportmap5 is situated in London's Docklands, and is the closest to central London, which limits its size - the airport has a single runway, which is very short. As a result, no large aircraft are permitted to use the airport, which initially prevented all long-haul flights. However, since 2009, British Airways has operated a flight to New York JFK, via Shannon, using an Airbus A318.  The largest aircraft currently handled at the airport is the Bombardier CS100, with the first commercial flight completed in August 2017 from Zurich.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nLocated only four miles from Canary Wharf, London City Airport is often used by business travellers, with many flights serving destinations across the UK and northern Europe. The airport cannot be expanded due to the docks on either side. It is also the only airport serving London which does not operate at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nA light rail service from London City Airport DLR station, which adjoins the terminal building of London City Airport, links it to the financial district of the City of London at Bank and Monument stations, which offer interchanges with London Underground.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocated in the London Borough of Hillingdon, Heathrowmap1 is by far the largest of London's airports and considered the main gateway into the United Kingdom for non-European visitors. Heathrow has four terminals and two parallel runways. Due to the location in London's western suburbs, Heathrow has had trouble trying to expand, with various expansion projects being cancelled.[9]) As a result, the airport consistently runs at over 99% capacity and is often included on lists of the worst-rated airports in the world.[10] However, on 1 July 2015 Heathrow's expansion plan was suggested as the best option by the Airport Commission and on 25 October 2016 a new northwest runway and terminal was approved by the Government. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe airport is connected to Great Britain's motorway network via the M4 and M25 motorways, to London Paddington station by Heathrow Express[11] and TfL Rail[12] trains and to other Central London destinations by London Underground trains on the Piccadilly line.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2012, Heathrow announced that for the first time in history it handled 70 million passengers in a calendar year,[13] making it the third busiest airport in the world in terms of passenger numbers, after Atlanta and Beijing. It also comes second behind Dubai International Airport in the list of the busiest airport in the world in terms of international passenger numbers, as well as being the busiest airport in Europe by total passenger numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeathrow serves six continents around the world, and is the base for the flag carrier British Airways in Terminal 5. While it also serves short-haul flights, Heathrow is London's long-distance hub and is the most popular arrival point for flights from the United States of America, with 13 million passengers. However, because it is operating at capacity, Heathrow has failed to increase service to cities in the newly industrialised countries such as China, falling behind European bases like Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocated in West Sussex, Gatwickmap2 is the second-busiest airport in the United Kingdom, the eighth-busiest in Europe, and the second-busiest single-runway airport in the world. It handles flights to more destinations than any other UK airport[14] and is the main base of easyJet[15], the UK's largest airline by number of passengers.[16] Also using it as a base are British Airways, Norwegian Air Shuttle and TUI Airways.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe airport consists of two terminals, North and South, is connected to the motorway network via the M23 and has its own railway station, with  Southern and Thameslink trains serving London Victoria and London Bridge stations respectively as well as there being a dedicated Gatwick Express shuttle to and from London Victoria.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocated on the Bedfordshire / Hertfordshire border, Luton Airportmap4 is London's fourth-largest airport, the fifth-busiest in the United Kingdom and the third-closest to the capital, after Heathrow and City airports.  The two airlines supplying most passenger capacity are the low-cost carriers easyJet and Wizz Air.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuton Airport Parkway railway station can be reached from London St Pancras in as little as 22 minutes via East Midlands Trains, while Thameslink is the primary operator, with slower but more frequent services.  A shuttle bus service connects Luton Airport Parkway to the airport, a distance of just over a mile.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocated in Essex, Stanstedmap3 is London's third-busiest airport, being the fourth-busiest in the United Kingdom, behind Manchester Airport, 22nd-busiest in Europe and the largest operational base for Ryanair, which is Europe's largest low-cost carrier and the world's largest international airline by number of international passengers.[17]. Stansted serves more scheduled European destinations than any other airport in the UK[18], as well as some  destinations further afield. It is the home of Harrods Aviation, allowing VIP aircraft to land there, such as Air Force One carrying the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in 2009 and also 2016.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nStansted Airport railway station is situated in the terminal building directly below the main concourse.[20] Services to Central London are on the Stansted Express train to and from London Liverpool Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocated in Essex, Southend Airportmap6 expanded commercial air transport operations to destinations in Ireland in 2011, and to mainland Europe in 2012 when easyJet commenced operations using the brand new terminal and railway station. Southend claims it only takes 15 minutes to go through arrivals from plane to train with hand luggage. It was once the third-busiest airport in the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouthend Airport railway station is served by Abellio Greater Anglia trains, which connect the airport to London Liverpool Street station up to 8 times per hour. The journey to London takes about one hour.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of other airports also serve the London area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following are mainly used by general aviation flights.\\r\\n\\r\\nAirports are listed at their current borough, although the area may have been outside London at the time of construction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were several Royal Air Force stations in London. This list excludes those that are classed as non-flying stations.\\r\\n\\r\\nStation are listed at their current borough, although the area may have been outside London at the time of construction.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to London's high capacity, in particular London Heathrow, Boris Johnson, London's former mayor, and Sir Norman Foster have both brought up plans to have a new airport built, either on a man-made island in the Thames Estuary, or on the Isle of Grain in North Kent. Foster's proposed Thames Hub Airport would be very similar to the design of Hong Kong International Airport and Qatar's Hamad International Airport. The plans to have an airport able to handle 110 million passengers a year would require the closure of Heathrow, and probably make the new airport the busiest in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plans have met with opposition from some people living nearby warning the airport would create a significant increase in bird strikes.[22] Other people and local businesses, recognising the depressed levels of economic activity in North Kent, have been supportive and argue that London needs a new airport in order to be able to compete in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn total, there were 30 international destinations from London, and another 3 domestic routes, that handled more than 1 million passengers in 2011:\\r\\n\\r\\nHeathrow Airport is a major hub for flights across the North Atlantic. In 2011, 11% of all north Atlantic flights originated or terminated at Heathrow, more than Paris and Frankfurt combined, and Heathrow is the European terminus for 11 of the 25 busiest north Atlantic routes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe busiest long-haul route in the world is between London (Heathrow and Gatwick) and New York (JFK and Newark), with a total of 3,898,460 passengers travelling between the two cities in 2011.[citation needed]","input":"What is the main airport in london england?"},{"output":"34ÿ28","context":"Super Bowl LI was an American football game played at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, on February 5, 2017,[8][9] to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2016 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots, after trailing by as many as 25 points (28ÿ3) during the third quarter, defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Atlanta Falcons, 34ÿ28 in overtime. The Patriots' 25-point comeback is the largest comeback in Super Bowl history,[10][11] and Super Bowl LI was the first to be decided in overtime.[12][13]\\r\\nThe Patriots' victory was their fifth, moving them into a three-way tie with the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers for second place on the all-time Super Bowl wins list, trailing only the Pittsburgh Steelers who have six victories. New England, after finishing the regular season with a league-best 14ÿ2 record, advanced to their record-setting ninth Super Bowl appearance, their second in three years, and their seventh under the leadership of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. The Falcons entered the game after completing an 11ÿ5 regular season record, and were trying to win their first Super Bowl title, having lost their only previous appearance in Super Bowl XXXIII.\\r\\nAfter a scoreless first quarter, Atlanta scored 21 points before New England made a field goal with two seconds left in the second quarter, to make it a 21ÿ3 halftime lead. The Falcons then increased their lead to 28ÿ3 midway through the third quarter, with quarterback Matt Ryan completing his second touchdown pass. The Patriots then scored 25 unanswered points to tie the game, 28ÿ28, with 57 seconds left in regulation. New England won the overtime coin toss, received the kickoff and drove 75 yards to win with a 2-yard touchdown run by running back James White. When the game ended, more than 30 team and individual Super Bowl records had been either broken or matched.[14] White's 14 receptions and his 20 points scored (off of 3 touchdowns and a two-point conversion) were among these broken records.[15] New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who also broke single-game Super Bowl records with 43 completed passes, 62 pass attempts, and 466 passing yards, was named Super Bowl MVP for a record fourth time.\\r\\nFox's broadcast of the game averaged around 111.3 million viewers, slightly down from the 111.9 million viewers of the previous year's Super Bowl.[16] Average TV viewership for the halftime show, headlined by Lady Gaga,[17] was higher at 117.5 million.[18] On the following day a number of media outlets immediately hailed the game as the greatest Super Bowl of all time.[19][20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NFL selected the sites for Super Bowl 50 and Super Bowl LI at the owners' spring meetings in Boston on May 21, 2013.[22] On October 16, 2012, the NFL announced that Reliant Stadium in Houston, which was renamed NRG Stadium in 2014, was a finalist to host Super Bowl LI.[23] Houston then competed against the runner-up for the site of Super Bowl 50: Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.[22][23] The South Florida bid for either Super Bowl partially depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations. However, on May 3, the Florida Legislature refused to approve the funding plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a blow to South Florida's chances.[24] The NFL ultimately selected Houston as the host city of Super Bowl LI.[25]\\r\\nThis was the second Super Bowl to be held at NRG Stadium, the other being Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004, which also featured the New England Patriots against that season's NFC South champion Carolina Panthers. It was also the third time the Super Bowl has been played in Houston, with Super Bowl VIII in 1974 having been held at Rice Stadium. With the Astros baseball team reaching the World Series eight months later, Houston would become just the fourth city to host both the Super Bowl and Fall Classic in the same calendar year, following San Diego (1998), Detroit (2006) and Arlington, Texas (2011); and the first among the four to win the Major League Baseball championship.\\r\\nProposition 1, an ordinance which would have prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in Houston's housing, employment, public accommodations, and city contracting, was rejected by voters (60.97% opposing[26]) during the November 3, 2015 elections. Subsequently, the NFL announced it would not alter plans to have the city host Super Bowl LI.[27][28] Houston Texans owner Bob McNair donated $10,000 to Campaign for Houston, an organization that opposes the ordinance, which he later rescinded.[29]\\r\\nIn 2016, New England tied an NFL record, earning 12+ wins for the seventh consecutive season. Even though starting quarterback Tom Brady was suspended for the first four games, and All-Pro tight end Rob Gronkowski was lost to injury in midseason, the Patriots still recorded an NFL-best 14ÿ2 record; their only losses were a shutout loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 4 and a loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 10. They scored 441 points (third in the NFL) while allowing the fewest in the league (250).[30]\\r\\nBrady missed the first four games of the year on suspension due to a 2014 postseason incident known as Deflategate. Jimmy Garoppolo and Jacoby Brissett each started two games in Brady's place. After his suspension ended, Brady took back command of the offense and went on to earn his 12th Pro Bowl selection, passing for 3,554 yards and 28 touchdowns, with only two interceptions, while his 112.2 passer rating ranked second in the NFL. The team's leading receiver was Julian Edelman, who caught 98 passes for 1,106 yards and added 135 more returning punts. Wide receivers Chris Hogan (38 receptions for 680 yards) and Malcolm Mitchell (32 receptions for 401 yards) were also significant receiving threats. Gronkowski caught 25 passes for 540 yards before suffering a season-ending back injury in week 13. Tight end Martellus Bennett stepped up in his absence, hauling in 55 receptions for 701 yards and a team-leading seven touchdown catches. Running back LeGarrette Blount was the team's top rusher with 1,168 yards and a league-leading 18 touchdowns. In passing situations, the team relied heavily on running back James White, who caught 60 passes for 551 yards and added another 166 on the ground.[31] Running back Dion Lewis was also a valuable asset to the offense, rushing for 283 yards on offense and catching 17 passes for 94 yards.[31]\\r\\nDespite trading All-Pro outside linebacker Jamie Collins to the Cleveland Browns in the middle of the season, the Patriots defensive line was led by tackle Trey Flowers, who ranked first on the team with seven quarterback sacks, and Jabaal Sheard, who recorded five sacks of his own. Linebacker Dont'a Hightower earned his first Pro Bowl selection and made the second All-Pro team, compiling 65 tackles and 2? sacks. Linebacker Rob Ninkovich also made a big impact, recording 34 tackles, two forced fumbles, and four sacks. In the secondary, cornerback Malcolm Butler led the team with four interceptions, while Logan Ryan led the team in tackles and intercepted two passes. Safety Devin McCourty ranked second on the team with 83 tackles and notched one interception while earning his third career Pro Bowl selection. The team also had a defensive expert on special teams, Matthew Slater, who made the Pro Bowl for the sixth consecutive year.[32]\\r\\nBy advancing to play in Super Bowl LI, the Patriots earned their NFL-record ninth Super Bowl appearance, as well as their seventh in the past 16 years under Brady and head coach Bill Belichick. The Patriots have also participated in the only other Super Bowl to be held at NRG Stadium; they won Super Bowl XXXVIII over the Carolina Panthers by a 32ÿ29 score thirteen years earlier. The Patriots entered Super Bowl LI with an overall record of 4ÿ4 in their previous eight Super Bowl appearances, with all four of their wins and two of their four losses coming under the leadership of Belichick and Brady.[33]\\r\\nWith his appearance in Super Bowl LI, Belichick broke the tie of six Super Bowls as a head coach that he had shared with Don Shula. It was also his record tenth participation in a Super Bowl in any capacity, which overtook the mark of nine that he had shared with Dan Reeves. This was also Brady's seventh Super Bowl appearance, the most appearances by a player in Super Bowl history.[34][35]\\r\\nThe Atlanta Falcons, under second-year head coach Dan Quinn, finished the 2016 season with an 11ÿ5 record, earning them the No. 2 seed in the NFC playoffs. It was a big reversal of declining fortunes for the team, who had failed to qualify to play in the playoffs in each of the last three seasons.[36]\\r\\nThe Falcons were loaded with offensive firepower, leading all NFL teams in scoring with 540 points. Nine-year veteran quarterback Matt Ryan earned the NFL MVP and the AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award, as well as his fourth career Pro Bowl selection, leading the league in passer rating (117.1). While he ranked only ninth in completions (373), his passing yards (4,944) and touchdowns (38) both ranked second in the NFL. His favorite target was receiver Julio Jones, who caught 83 passes for 1,409 yards (second in the NFL) and six touchdowns. But Ryan had plenty of other options, such as newly acquired wide receivers Mohamed Sanu (59 receptions for 653 yards) and Taylor Gabriel (35 receptions for 579 yards and six touchdowns). Pro Bowl running back Devonta Freeman was the team's leading rusher, with 1,078 yards, 11 touchdowns, and 4.8 yards per rush. He was also a superb receiver out of the backfield, catching 54 passes for 462 yards and two more scores. Running back Tevin Coleman was also a major asset on the ground and through the air, with 520 rushing yards, 31 receptions for 421 yards, and 11 total touchdowns. The Falcons also had an excellent special teams unit led by veteran kick returner Eric Weems. His 24 punt returns for 273 yards gave him the sixth highest return average in the NFL (11.4), and he added another 391 yards returning kickoffs. Pro Bowl kicker Matt Bryant led the league in scoring with 158 points, while also ranking third in field goal percentage (91.8%).[37][38] Atlanta's offensive line featured center Alex Mack, who earned his fourth Pro Bowl selection.[39]\\r\\nThe Falcons defensive line was led by defensive ends Adrian Clayborn, who recorded five sacks and a fumble recovery, and long-time veteran Dwight Freeney, who ranks as the NFL's 18th all-time leader in sacks (122?). Behind them, linebacker Vic Beasley was the team's only Pro Bowl selection on defense, leading the NFL in sacks with 15?; Beasley also forced six fumbles. Rookie linebacker Deion Jones was also an impact player, leading the team in combined tackles (108) and interceptions (three). The Falcons secondary featured hard-hitting safety Keanu Neal, who had 106 tackles and forced five fumbles. Safety Ricardo Allen added 90 tackles and two interceptions. But overall, the defense ranked just 27th in the league in points allowed (406).[39]\\r\\nThis game marked the Falcons' second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history, after having lost Super Bowl XXXIII in January 1999 to the Denver Broncos.[40]\\r\\nThe Patriots, with the AFC's #1 seed, began their postseason run by defeating the fourth-seeded Houston Texans in the Divisional Round, 34ÿ16.[41][42] The next week, in the AFC Championship Game, the Patriots defeated the third-seeded Pittsburgh Steelers 36-17.[43][44]\\r\\nThe Falcons, with the NFC's #2 seed, began their postseason run by defeating the third-seeded Seattle Seahawks in the Divisional Round, 36ÿ20, racking up 422 yards.[45][46] The next week, in the last NFL game ever played at the Georgia Dome,[47] the Falcons racked up 493 total yards as they defeated the fourth-seeded Green Bay Packers 44ÿ21 to win the NFC Championship.[48][49]\\r\\nAs the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Falcons elected to wear their red home jerseys with white pants,[50][51] which meant that the Patriots wore their white road jerseys.[50] The game featured Atlanta's #1 scoring offense versus New England's #1 scoring defense. This was the sixth Super Bowl since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 to feature a #1 scoring offense against a #1 scoring defense, with the team with the #1 scoring defense winning four of the previous five matchups.[52][53]\\r\\nFan-oriented activities during the lead-up to Super Bowl LI were centered around the George R. Brown Convention Center and Discovery Green park. Discovery Green hosted Super Bowl Live, a 10-day festival which featured live concerts and other attractions, including projection shows, fireworks shows, and a virtual reality attraction, Future Flight, in conjunction with NASA. The neighboring George R. Brown Convention Center hosted the annual NFL Experience event, which featured interactive activities and appearances by players.[54] Super Bowl Opening Night, the second edition of the game's revamped media day, was held on January 30, 2017 at nearby Minute Maid Park.[55]\\r\\nSuper Bowl Live was organized by the Houston Super Bowl Host Committee, which was led by Honorary Chairman James A. Baker, III, Chairman Ric Campo, and President and CEO Sallie Sargent.[56]\\r\\nAccording to Bloomberg story two most anticipated pre-Super Bowl parties were invite-only 13th annual ESPN party and the Rolling Stone party.[57] ESPN party was hosted by Fergie and DJ Khaled and took place in a 65,000-square-foot warehouse in the Houston Arts District.[57] The Rolling Stone party celebrated the magazine 50th anniversary. It took place at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston and featured the performance of Big Sean, DJ Cassidy, Nas, Diplo and Busta Rhymes.[58]\\r\\nThe Patriots stayed at the JW Marriott Houston and practiced at the University of Houston. The Falcons stayed at the Westin Houston Memorial City and practiced at Rice University.[59]\\r\\nIn the beginning of February 2017 the NFL and law enforcement announced that tickets to Super Bowl LI would feature heat-sensitive logos to deter counterfeit tickets. On the front of each ticket was a full polymer graphic that was raised and the back features a true color security label with Houston's skyline and the Super Bowl logo. The final security feature was a graphic on the lower portion of the back of each ticket printed with thermochromic ink. The HTX logo and the NRG Stadium image faded when heat was applied and returned when the heat source was removed.[60]\\r\\nThe estimated average price for a ticket was $4,744.[61]\\r\\nIn late 2016, Uber had threatened to leave Houston ahead of the Super Bowl LI festivities, insisting various city regulations, including fingerprint background checks of drivers, were too burdensome and prevented drivers from working. Houston officials and Uber reached a compromise in December, which determined that Houston would continue to require a fingerprint check for drivers but eliminate requirements for driver drug testing and physicals through at least February 5.[62]\\r\\nIn the United States, Super Bowl LI was televised by Fox, as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL.[63][64] The game was carried in Spanish by sister cable network Fox Deportes.[65][66][67] Online streams of the game were provided via Fox Sports Go; although normally requiring a television subscription to use, Fox made the service available as a free preview for the Super Bowl. Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity, streaming on smartphones was exclusive to Verizon Wireless subscribers via the NFL Mobile app.[68][69]\\r\\nAs with Super Bowl 50, the stadium was equipped for Intel freeD instant replay technology, using an array of 36 5K resolution cameras positioned around the stadium to enable 360-degree views of plays. Fox introduced a new feature utilizing the system known as Be the Player, which composited the various camera angles into a single view of a play from the point-of-view of a player on the field.[70][71] Fox constructed a temporary, two-floor studio in Discovery Green, which originated pre-game coverage, and broadcasts of Fox Sports 1 studio programs during the week leading up to the game, such as Fox Sports Live, The Herd with Colin Cowherd, Skip and Shannon: Undisputed, NASCAR Race Hub, and UFC Tonight.[72]\\r\\nAn average of 111.3 million viewers watched Super Bowl LI, down from 2016. Fox stated that 1.72 million viewers utilized its online streams.[16]\\r\\nFox set the base rate for a 30-second commercial at $5 million, the same rate CBS charged for Super Bowl 50,[73] leading to advertising revenue of $534 million for the single day event.[74] Snickers announced that it would present a live commercial during the game.[73] Nintendo broadcast an ad showcasing its upcoming Nintendo Switch video game console.[75] Fiat Chrysler Automobiles broadcast three spots for Alfa Romeo, as part of an effort to re-launch the Italian brand in the U.S.[76][77]\\r\\nA spot from longtime advertiser Budweiser garnered controversy before the game for depicting Anheuser-Busch co-founder Adolphus Busch's emigration to the United States from Germany, its broadcast coming on the heels of U.S. President Donald Trump signing an executive order that bans travelers from several Muslim nations.[78] Meanwhile, 84 Lumber aired a commercial depicting a mother and daughter journeying from Mexico to the United States, which had been edited following Fox's objection to its depiction of a border wall for sensitivity reasons.[79][80][81][82]\\r\\nMany films were advertised with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Logan, Transformers: The Last Knight, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and The Fate of the Furious. AMC and Netflix advertised their shows, The Walking Dead and Stranger Things, respectively, while National Geographic teased its new series Genius with an ad featuring a nod to Lady Gaga's halftime performance.[83][84]\\r\\nFox was able to earn an estimated $20 million by airing four extra commercials due to the additional overtime period. Even without historical precedent, Fox negotiated deals with a handful of advertisers in case overtime were to occur.[85]\\r\\nCanadian broadcast rights to Super Bowl LI were subject to a still-ongoing legal dispute; although U.S. network affiliates are carried by pay TV providers in the country, Canadian law grants domestic broadcast stations the right to require that these signals be substituted with their own if they are carrying the same program in simulcast with a U.S. station (\\"simsub\\"). This policy is intended to help protect Canadian advertising revenue from being lost to viewers watching via U.S. feeds of a program. In 2016, as part of a larger series of regulatory reforms, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) banned the Super Bowl from being substituted under these circumstances, meaning that the telecast on CTVa simulcast of the U.S. telecast with Canadian advertising inserted, would co-exist with feeds of the game from U.S. network affiliates. The CRTC cited dissatisfaction surrounding the practice from Canadian viewersparticularly the unavailability of the U.S. commercials, which the CRTC cited as being an \\"integral part\\" of the game based on this reception, but also other technical problems caused by poorly implemented simsubs (such as reduced quality and missing content due to mistimed transitions back into the U.S. program feed).[105][106][107]\\r\\nThe NFL's Canadian rightsholder Bell Media, as well as the league itself, have displayed objections to the policy; Bell felt that the decision devalued its exclusive Canadian rights to the game, and violated Canada's Broadcasting Act, which forbids the \\"making of regulations singling out a particular program or licensee.\\"[105] On November 2, 2016, Bell was granted the right to challenge the ruling in the Federal Court of Appeal.[108] Bell, the NFL, and government representatives from both Canada and the U.S., have lobbied the CRTC for the rule to be retracted.[109] However, court action on the ruling was not taken in time for the game, meaning that it was in effect for the first time during Super Bowl LI.[110] Bell Media cited the decision, among other factors, as justification for a planned series of layoffs it announced on January 31, 2017.[111]\\r\\nThe simsub prohibition only applied to the game itself, and not pre-game or post-game programming (which was simulcast with Fox and subject to simsub). In an attempt to mitigate the loss of de facto exclusivity to the clean U.S. feeds, Bell simulcast the game across CTV Two and TSN in addition to CTV, and organized a sponsored sweepstakes in which viewers could earn entries to win cash and automobile prizes by texting keywords displayed during the Canadian telecast.[112][113] Montreal Gazette media analyst Steve Faguy felt that these promotions were an attempt to offset the loss of viewership by carrying the game across as many of its channels as possible, and providing incentives for viewers to watch the game on CTV instead of Fox. He further noted that Bell still had exclusive rights to stream the game in Canada via CTV's TV Everywhere services, as the CRTC does not regulate web content, and Fox's online stream is only available to U.S. users.[112] Consequently, some Canadian companies (such as Leon's and Pizza Pizza) took advantage of the CRTC decision by buying local advertising time during the game from Fox affiliates distributed in Canada in order to target these viewers, such as KAYU-TV in Spokane (which is widely carried by television providers in the significantly larger markets of Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta).[114]\\r\\nViewership of Super Bowl LI across the three English-language Bell Media properties broadcasting it was down by 39% in comparison to Super Bowl 50, with only 4.47 million viewers. Viewership on the French-language telecast presented by TSN's sister network RDS was in line with that of Super Bowl 50. It is not known how many Canadian viewers watched the game via Fox, as neither Nielsen or Canadian ratings provider Numeris calculate Canadian viewership of American broadcasters.[110]\\r\\nIn the United States, Westwood One carried the broadcast nationwide, with Kevin Harlan on play-by-play, Boomer Esiason and Mike Holmgren on color commentary, and sideline reports from Tony Boselli and James Lofton.[115] The Westwood One broadcast was simulcast in Canada on TSN Radio.[116] Each team's network flagship station carried the local feed: WBZ-FM for the Patriots (with Bob Socci and Scott Zolak announcing), and WZGC for the Falcons (with Wes Durham and Dave Archer announcing); under the league's contract with Westwood One, no other stations in the teams' usual radio networks were allowed to carry the local broadcast, and unlike in recent years when at least one of the two flagships was a clear-channel station, both the Patriots and Falcons use FM radio stations as their local flagships, limiting listenership to those within the local metropolitan areas or with access to those feeds via Sirius XM satellite radio or TuneIn Premium.\\r\\nSpanish-language radio rights are held by Entravision as part of a three-year agreement signed in 2015.[65] Erwin Higueros served as the play-by-play announcer.[117]\\r\\nThe United Kingdom's BBC Radio 5 Live produced a commercial-free broadcast, with Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman returning.[118]\\r\\nÿPope Francis indicated that by participating in sports events, people show an ability to go beyond self-interests and build friendship and solidarity with one another.[119]\\r\\nDuring pre-game festivities, the NFL honored members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame that had played college football at historically black colleges and universities. Of the 303 members of the Hall of Fame, 29 were from HBCUs.[120]\\r\\nThe Patriots took the field first as the designated away team to Ozzy Osbourne's \\"Crazy Train\\". The Falcons took the field second as the designated home team to Trick Daddy's \\"Let's Go\\". Both teams' season recaps were presented by Ving Rhames.[121]\\r\\nBefore the game, American country music singer and songwriter Luke Bryan sang the US national anthem.[122] Bryan was the first male performer to sing the national anthem at a Super Bowl since Billy Joel at Super Bowl XLI. Immediately before Bryan sang the national anthem, Phillipa Soo, Rene Elise Goldsberry and Jasmine Cephas Jones, who originated the roles of the Schuyler sisters in the Broadway musical Hamilton, performed \\"America the Beautiful\\".[123]\\r\\nAfter the national anthem, former President George H. W. Bush performed the coin toss alongside his wife, Barbara.[124] The Patriots called heads, but the Falcons won the coin toss with tails.[125] The Falcons chose to defer to the second half.\\r\\nOn September 29, 2016, Lady Gaga, who had performed the national anthem the previous year at Super Bowl 50, confirmed that she would be performing at the Super Bowl LI halftime show on her Instagram account with the message: \\"It's not an illusion. The rumors are true. This year the SUPER BOWL goes GAGA!\\"[126] Fox Sports president and executive producer of the show, John Entz, confirmed Gaga's involvement adding \\"[She] is one of the most electric performers of our generation, and we couldn't be happier with the choice to have her headline the Super Bowl LI Halftime Show... It is going to be an incredible night.\\"[127]\\r\\nLady Gaga opened the halftime show with a combination of \\"God Bless America\\" and \\"This Land Is Your Land\\". Her performance also included some of her biggest hit songs, such as \\"Poker Face\\", \\"Born This Way\\", \\"Million Reasons\\", and \\"Bad Romance\\"[128] and was accompanied by a swarm of 300 LED-equipped Intel drones forming an American flag in the sky in a pre-recorded segment.[129][130][131][132]\\r\\nMohamed Sanu stated the long length of the halftime show played a part in Atlanta ultimately losing the game. Teams on average are off the field for fifteen minutes during halftime, but Super Bowl halftimes are considerably longer. Unlike the Falcons it appears Bill Belichick actually incorporated the length of the show into the team's practices.[133] Sanu's argument was discounted by the fact that Atlanta marched the ball downfield and scored a touchdown right out of halftime.[134]\\r\\nThe first quarter of Super Bowl LI was a scoreless defensive match with each team punting twice. The longest play from scrimmage was a 37-yard carry by Falcons running back Devonta Freeman, which did not lead to any points, though it would be the longest run of the game for either team.\\r\\nOn the first play of the second quarter, New England's quarterback Tom Brady completed a 27-yard pass to wide receiver Julian Edelman on the Falcons 33-yard line. But on the next play, linebacker Deion Jones stripped the ball from running back LeGarrette Blount; the fumble was recovered by defensive back Robert Alford on the 29-yard line. On the next two plays, Matt Ryan completed passes to Julio Jones for gains of 19 and 23 yards. Freeman ran the ball on the next three plays, covering the final 29 yards to the end zone, the last carry a 5-yard touchdown run that put Atlanta up 7ÿ0.\\r\\nNew England failed to get a first down on the series following the Freeman score, and the Falcons moved the ball 62 yards in five plays. Ryan started the drive with a 24-yard completion to Taylor Gabriel, then completed a pass to Jones for an 18-yard gain. On 3rd-and-9, he threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end Austin Hooper, giving the Falcons a 14ÿ0 lead. It was the largest deficit Brady had ever faced in his seven Super Bowl appearances, and it would soon get larger.[135] New England responded with a drive to the Falcons 23, aided by three defensive holding penalties against the Atlanta defense, each one giving them a first down on a third down play. However, on 3rd-and-6, Brady threw a pass that was intercepted by Alford and returned 82 yards for a touchdown, increasing Atlanta's lead to 21ÿ0. It was the first time in his career that Brady had thrown a pick-six in his 33 postseason games,[136] and Alford's 82 yard return was the second longest interception return in Super Bowl history.[137] Brady ultimately became the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl in which he threw a pick-six. Getting the ball back with 2:20 left in the second quarter, Brady completed a 15-yard pass to Martellus Bennett, and then a short pass to running back James White, who took off for a 28-yard gain. The drive stalled at the Falcons 20-yard line, but Stephen Gostkowski kicked a field goal with two seconds left on the clock to send the teams into their locker rooms with the score 21ÿ3.\\r\\nNew England had an early third quarter scoring opportunity when Edelman returned a punt 26 yards to the Patriots' 47-yard line, but they could not gain a first down on the drive. Following the Patriots' punt, the Falcons started their drive on their own 15-yard line, Ryan completed two long passes to wide receiver Taylor Gabriel for gains of 17 and 35 yards to bring the ball to the New England 28-yard line. Four plays later, Ryan finished the 85-yard drive with a 6-yard touchdown pass to running back Tevin Coleman, giving the Falcons a 28ÿ3 lead with 8:31 left in the quarter. On the next series, Brady led the Patriots 75 yards in 13 plays for a responding touchdown, completing five of seven passes for 43 yards, the biggest a 17-yard completion to Danny Amendola on 4th-and-3 from the New England 46-yard line. Brady also made a big play with his legs, rushing for a 15-yard gain (which would be the longest rushing play by the Patriots on the day) on 3rd-and-8 from the Atlanta 35-yard line. Three subsequent carries by Blount moved the ball 15 yards to the 5-yard line, and then Brady threw the ball to White for a touchdown, making the score 28ÿ9 after Gostkowski's extra point attempt hit the right goalpost.\\r\\nNew England then attempted an onside kick, but the ball was recovered by Falcons linebacker LaRoy Reynolds, and a penalty against Gostkowski for touching the ball before it went ten yards gave Atlanta even better field position. Ryan completed a 9-yard pass to Hooper to the Patriots 32-yard-line, but on the next play, a holding penalty on Atlanta offensive lineman Jake Matthews pushed the team back ten yards. Then after an incompletion, Trey Flowers and Kyle Van Noy shared a sack on Ryan that forced the Falcons to punt on the first play of the fourth quarter.\\r\\nMatt Bosher's 42-yard punt pinned the Patriots back on their own 13-yard line. Brady led the next drive down the field, completing three passes to wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell for 40 yards and one to Bennett for 25 to bring the ball to the Falcons 7-yard line. However, Brady was sacked twice by defensive tackle Grady Jarrett over the next three plays, and the Patriots ended up having to settle for Gostkowski's 33-yard field goal that cut their deficit to two scores, 28ÿ12, with less than 10 minutes left in the game. Atlanta had burned two of their three time outs on defense and equipment malfunction. On the third play of Atlanta's ensuing drive, linebacker Dont'a Hightower sacked Ryan as he was winding up for a pass, resulting in a fumble that was recovered by defensive tackle Alan Branch on the Falcons 25-yard line. New England soon cashed in their scoring opportunity, with Brady throwing a 6-yard touchdown pass to Amendola. Then White took a direct snap in for a two-point conversion to make the score 28ÿ20 in favor of Atlanta with 5:56 left on the clock. The Patriots had run the same play for a two-point conversion with Kevin Faulk in their Super Bowl XXXVIII victory.\\r\\nOn the first play of Atlanta's next possession, Freeman caught a short pass from Ryan and ran it for a 39-yard gain, the longest play of the game for either team. Then on 2nd-and-9 from the Patriots 49-yard line, Ryan threw a deep pass to Jones at the right sideline, who made an acrobatic sideline catch for a 27-yard gain, giving the Falcons a first down on the Patriots 22-yard line with 4:40 left on the clock and a chance for a late-game two-score lead.[138] On the next play, Freeman ran for a 1-yard loss on a tackle by Devin McCourty. Atlanta tried to pass the ball on second down, but Flowers sacked Ryan for a 12-yard loss on the Patriots 35-yard line. Ryan then completed a 9-yard pass to Mohamed Sanu on 3rd-and 23, but this was negated by a holding penalty on Matthews. Now out of field goal range and faced with 3rd-and-33 from the New England 45-yard line, Ryan threw an incomplete pass, and the team was left with no choice but to punt the ball to New England.\\r\\nBosher's 36-yard kick gave the Patriots the ball on their own 9-yard line with 3:30 left on the clock and two of their timeouts left. After two incompletions, Brady picked up a first down with a 16-yard pass to Chris Hogan. After an 11-yard pass to Mitchell, Brady threw a pass that was nearly intercepted by Alford. Instead, he batted the ball in the air, and it fell into the arms of Edelman, who made a diving catch and just barely managed to get his hands under the ball before it hit the ground, picking up 23 yards. Atlanta challenged the catch, but the referees confirmed the call on the field and Atlanta lost their final time out. Brady's next pass to Amendola gained 20 yards to the Falcons 21-yard line as the clock ran down below the two-minute warning. Two more passes to White gained 20 yards and gave New England a first down at the 1-yard line. With 58 seconds left, White scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, and Brady completed a 2-point conversion pass to Amendola, tying the score at 28. Atlanta started their drive deep in their own end with just under a minute and zero time outs. The Falcons failed to get in range to score a possible game-winning field goal and punted, with the Patriots fair catching the ball at their own 35-yard line. The Patriots considered, but ultimately declined, ending regulation on what would have been the first fair catch kick ever attempted in a Super Bowl.[139] Instead, New England attempted a fake quarterback kneel running play for Dion Lewis. The play gained several yards but failed to score and sent the Super Bowl into overtime for the first time in the game's history. Super Bowl LI became the first NFL championship game to go into an overtime period since the historic 1958 NFL Championship Game between the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants.[140]\\r\\nThe Patriots won the coin toss to start overtime, and elected to receive the ball. Starting at their 25-yard line after a touchback, Brady completed passes to White, Amendola, and Hogan for gains of 6, 14, and 18 yards, respectively. Then after White was dropped for a 3-yard loss, Brady completed a 15-yard pass to Edelman to the Falcons 25-yard line. White then took a lateral throw from Brady to the 15-yard line.[141] Brady's pass to Bennett in the end zone fell incomplete, but Falcons linebacker De'Vondre Campbell was called for pass interference, giving the Patriots first-and-goal from the Falcons' 2-yard line.[142] On first down, Brady threw another incomplete pass to Bennett that was deflected by Vic Beasley. On second down, White took a pitch and ran the ball right. He was hit by Falcons defenders at the 1-yard line, but managed to stretch forward and get the ball across the goal line before his knee hit the ground, scoring a touchdown to give the Patriots the 34ÿ28 victory. It marked the first time in NFL postseason history that a team leading by 17 points or more at the start of the fourth quarter went on to lose the game.[143] Previously, dating back to 1940, teams leading by 17 or more points after three quarters in playoff games were 133ÿ0 in such situations.[144]\\r\\nSuper Bowl LI had more than 30 records either broken, set, or tied by the time it was done.[14][145] Brady completed 43 of 62 passes for 466 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception, while also rushing for 15 yards. His completions, attempts, and passing yards were all single-game Super Bowl records. He also set the career Super Bowl records for games played (7), completions (207), attempts (309), yards (2,071), and touchdown passes (15). James White caught a Super Bowl record 14 passes for 110 yards, rushed for 29 yards, and tied a Super Bowl record with three touchdowns. He also set the record for most points scored with 20. After the game, Brady said he felt White deserved the MVP award more than he did.[146] Brady planned to give White the vehicle that has traditionally been awarded to Super Bowl MVPs (he'd given the truck he received after Super Bowl XLIX to Malcolm Butler) but found out after the game that there was no vehicle to give to White because the sponsor had decided to end its practice of donating one. Edelman caught five passes for 87 yards and returned three punts for 39 yards. Amendola recorded eight receptions for 78 yards and one touchdown. Flowers recorded six tackles and 2.5 sacks.\\r\\nFor Atlanta, Ryan completed 17 of 23 passes for 284 yards and two touchdowns. Freeman was the top rusher of the game with 11 carries for 75 yards and a touchdown, while also catching two passes for 46 yards. Jones was Atlanta's leading receiver with four receptions for 87 yards. Robert Alford had 11 tackles (9 solo), an interception returned for a touchdown, and a fumble recovery. Grady Jarrett had five tackles and tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks.[147]\\r\\nAtlanta became the first team in Super Bowl history to return an interception for a touchdown and lose the game. Prior to Super Bowl LI, teams returning an interception for a touchdown in the Super Bowl had been a perfect 12ÿ0.[148] New England had two turnovers for the game, while Atlanta only turned the ball over once. This made New England the fifth team to win a Super Bowl despite losing the turnover battle, joining the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl V, the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowls XIV and XL, and the Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX.[149]\\r\\nThe game set the record for the largest deficit overcome to win the Super Bowl (the previous record was ten points, set by the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XXII and matched by the New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV and by the Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX);[150] it is the third-largest comeback win in NFL playoff history, behind The Comeback (32-point deficit; Buffalo Bills trailed 35ÿ3 and won 41ÿ38) and the wild card game between the Indianapolis Colts and the Kansas City Chiefs during the 2013ÿ14 NFL playoffs (28-point deficit; Colts trailed 38ÿ10 and won, 45ÿ44). In addition to being the largest Super Bowl comeback, the game set the record for the largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL playoff history, as no team had previously won a playoff game after trailing by 17 or more points entering the final quarter; the Patriots were trailing by 19 points at the start of the fourth quarter by a score of 28ÿ9. The Patriots won their fifth franchise championship, all under the leadership of starting quarterback Tom Brady, the most by a single quarterback. Brady won his fourth Super Bowl MVP, the most such awards by a single player in history. This game represented the largest comeback in the history of the New England Patriots' regular season or post-season games,[151] and Tom Brady's NFL career.\\r\\nSuper Bowl LI became the first Super Bowl in history in which the winning team had never held the lead at any point during regulation time, and it also became the first Super Bowl in history in which the winning team did not score on a PAT kick, as the Patriots missed their only PAT attempt during the game, which occurred following their first touchdown, opted for two-point conversions after each of their next two touchdowns, and did not have to attempt the extra point after their game-winning touchdown in overtime.\\r\\nLate in the third quarter, the Falcons' chances of winning were estimated at 99.8%.[152][153]\\r\\nat NRG Stadium, Houston, Texas\\r\\nSources: The Football Database Super Bowl LI\\r\\n1Completions/attempts\\r\\n2Carries\\r\\n3Long gain\\r\\n4Receptions\\r\\n5Times targeted\\r\\nSuper Bowl LI had eight officials.[2] The numbers in parentheses below indicate their uniform numbers.","input":"What was the final score of last year's super bowl?"},{"output":"Captain America: Civil War","context":"","input":"When did the black panther first appear in marvel movies?"},{"output":"December 10, 1898","context":"","input":"When did us gain control of the philippines?"},{"output":"Micky Dolenz","context":"","input":"Who were the original members of the monkees?"},{"output":"statewide partisan elections","context":"The Supreme Court of Texas (\\"SCOTX\\") is the court of last resort for civil appeals (including juvenile delinquency which the law considers to be a civil matter and not criminal) in the U.S. state of Texas. A different court, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, is the court of last resort for criminal matters.\\r\\nThe Court is composed of a Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices. It was established in 1846 to replace the Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas. The Court meets in Downtown Austin, Texas in a building located on the state Capitol grounds, behind the Texas State Capitol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy statute, the Texas Supreme Court has administrative control over the State Bar of Texas, an agency of the judiciary.[2] The Texas Supreme Court has the sole authority to license attorneys in Texas,[3] and also appoints the members of the Board of Law Examiners[4] which, under instructions of the Supreme Court, administers the Texas bar examination.[5]\\r\\nThe Texas Supreme Court is the only state supreme court in the United States in which the manner in which it denies discretionary review can actually imply approval or disapproval of the merits of the lower court's decision and in turn may affect the geographic extent of the precedential effect of that decision. In March 1927, the Texas Legislature enacted a law directing the Texas Supreme Court to summarily refuse to hear applications for writs of error when it believed the Court of Appeals opinion correctly stated the law.[6] Thus, since June 1927, over 4,100 decisions of the Texas Courts of Appeals have become valid binding precedent of the Texas Supreme Court itself because the high court refused applications for writ of error rather than denying them and thereby signaled that it approved of their holdings as the law of the state.[6]\\r\\nWhile Texas' unique practice saved the state supreme court from having to hear relatively minor cases just to create uniform statewide precedents on those issues, it also makes for lengthy citations to the opinions of the Courts of Appeals, since the subsequent writ history of the case must always be noted (e.g., no writ, writ refused, writ denied, etc.) in order for the reader to determine at a glance whether the cited opinion is binding precedent only in the district of the Court of Appeals in which it was decided, or binding precedent for the entire state.[6]\\r\\nThe Court has a Chief Justice and eight associate justices. Each member of the Court must be at least 35 years of age, a citizen of Texas, licensed to practice law in Texas, and must have practiced law (or have been a lawyer and a judge of a court of record together) for at least ten years.[7] The Clerk of the Court is appointed by the Justices and serves a four-year term.\\r\\nThe Chief Justice and the Associate Justices are elected to staggered six-year terms in statewide partisan elections. When a vacancy arises the Governor of Texas may appoint Justices, subject to Senate confirmation, to serve out the remainder of an unexpired term until the next general election. As of 2017[update], seven of the current Justices, a majority, were originally appointed by Governor Rick Perry. The current Justices, like all the Judges of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, are all Republican.\\r\\nThe place numbers have no special meaning as all justices are elected statewide, except that the Chief Justice position is considered \\"Place 1\\".\\r\\nHortense Sparks Ward, who became the first woman to pass the Texas Bar Exam in 1910, was appointed Special Chief Justice of an all-female Texas Supreme Court 15 years later. All of the court's male justices recused themselves from Johnson v. Darr, a 1924 case involving the Woodmen of the World, and, since nearly every member of the Texas Bar was a member of that fraternal organization, paying personal insurance premiums that varied with the claims decided against it, no male judges or attorneys could be found to hear the case.[8] After ten months of searching for suitable male replacements to decide the case, Governor Pat Neff decided on January 1, 1925, to appoint a special court composed of three women. This court, consisting of Ward, Hattie Leah Henenberg, and Ruth Virginia Brazzil, met for five months and ultimately ruled in favor of Woodmen of the World.[9]\\r\\nOn July 25, 1982, Ruby Kless Sondock became the court's first regular female justice, when she was appointed to replace the Associate Justice James G. Denton who had died of a heart attack. Sondock served the remainder of Denton's term, which ended on December 31, 1982, but did not seek election to the Supreme Court in her own right.[10] Rose Spector became the first woman elected to the court in 1992 and served until 1998 when she was defeated by Harriet O'Neill.[11]\\r\\nJudicial Committee on Information Technology (JCIT)\\r\\nCreated in 1997 JCIT was established to set standards and guidelines for the systematic implementation and integration of information technology into the trial and appellate courts in Texas.\\r\\nJCIT approaches this mission by providing a forum for state-local, inter-branch, and public-private collaboration, and development of policy recommendations for the Supreme Court of Texas. Court technology, and the information it carries, are sprawling topics, and Texas is a diverse state with decentralized funding and decision-making for trial court technology. JCIT provides a forum for discussion of court technology and information projects. With this forum, JCIT reaches out to external partners such as the Conference of Urban Counties, the County Information Resource Agency, Texas.gov, and TIJIS (Texas Integrated Justice Information Systems), and advises or is consulted by the Office of Court Administration on a variety of projects.\\r\\nThree themes consistently recur in the JCIT conversation: expansion and governance of electronic filing; the evolution and proliferation of court case management systems; and the evolution and governance of technology standards for reporting and sharing information across systems in civil, family, juvenile, and criminal justice.\\r\\nThe Founding Chair of JCIT from 1997ÿ2009 was Peter S. Vogel, a partner at Gardere Wynne Sewell LLP in Dallas, and since 2009 the JCIT Chair has been Justice Rebecca Simmons.\\r\\nTexas is one of seven states that elects Supreme Court justices on partisan ballots. Four justices of the Texas Supreme Court faced re-election in 2014.[12] Three of the four sitting Supreme Court Justices, Chief Justice Nathan Hecht, Justice Jeff Brown and Justice Phil Johnson, were required to defeat challengers in a March primary before the general election in November. The candidates challenging the incumbent Supreme Court Justices, according to reports filed with the Texas Ethics Commission, were recruited for the election and funded by a Houston plaintiff lawyer and Ali Davari, owner of two strip clubs: Sexy City and Erotic Zone.[13][14]\\r\\nTexas for Lawsuit Reform commented on the Texas election by saying, Plaintiff trial lawyers are making an unprecedented attempt to regain the control of the Supreme Court that they enjoyed in the 1970s and 1980s, when Texas was known as 'The Lawsuit Capitol of the World.'\\" Also, an airing of Sixty Minutes entitled Justice for Sale gave a devastating critique of the Texas Supreme Court.[15]\\r\\nHouston plaintiff lawyer Mark Lanier, funded the bulk of the campaign to remove the Texas Supreme Court and business groups. Funding was disclosed in an article titled, \\"Plaintiff Trial Lawyers Attempt to Distort Role of Judges and Juries.\\"[16]\\r\\nIn the years preceding the Texas Judicial Election, Lanier had become a vocal critic of the Texas Supreme Court after the Supreme Court reversed his signature trial verdict against Merck & Co. on behalf of a widow whose husband died after taking Vioxx.[17] After Lanier suffered a second high-profile loss of a Vioxx case, in which the Fourteenth Court of Appeals in Houston concluded in MERCK & CO., INC. v. Ernst, a wrongful death case by a widow, that Lanier failed to show that the ingestion of Vioxx caused the death of his client's spouse.[18][19] Lanier's publicly criticized the Texas Supreme Court stating that it employs \\"a simpleton approach that basically white washes the trial, ignores the evidence, and is very conclusion based.\\"[19]\\r\\nLanier responded to the appellate setbacks in a press release:\\r\\nActivist judges are protecting corporate executives and stripping away the rights of widows and every other victim of corporate misconductThis decision was handed down by a group of judges who regularly accept campaign contributions from law firms representing corporations that appear in their courts. We will appeal this decision to the United States Supreme Court if necessary.[19]\\r\\nAll judicial challengers recruited and funded by the Texas plaintiff lawyers lost to the incumbent Texas Supreme Court justices who won the 2014 Texas election.[20]\\r\\nIn May 2016, in a 100-page ruling, the Supreme Court ruled that public school financing, a long-term political issue in Texas, is imperfect but constitutional. Specifically, the court ruled that the funding \\"satisfies minimum constitutional requirements.\\" More than half of the school districts across the state had wanted the court to force the Texas State Legislature to guarantee equal tax revenues to wealthy and poorer districts alike. The court, which has only one Democrat member among the nine justices, said that legislators must tackle school funding and not expect the court to make specific policy decisions.[21]\\r\\nTexas Supreme Court History: Links to Resources [1]\\r\\nCoordinates: 301633N 974428W? / ?30.275853N 97.741054W? / 30.275853; -97.741054","input":"How are supreme court judges selected in texas?"},{"output":"Phil Harris","context":"The FV Cornelia Marie was one of the commercial crab fishing boats featured on the Discovery Channel series Deadliest Catch.\\r\\nThe boat was formerly owned by Cornelia Marie Devlin (formerly Collins) and prior to his death, Phil Harris (who served as captain).

The FV Cornelia Marie returned to the Discovery Channel's program \\"Deadliest Catch\\" in the 8th episode of the 10th season. Her current home port is Kodiak, Alaska. In early 2015, the Cornelia Marie had a 50% stake sold to two new owners, who repowered the boat with new diesels and repaired her structure.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cornelia Marie was built in 1989 in Bayou La Batre, Alabama, on commission from original owner Ralph Collins; she was one of the last boats built by Horton Boats.

She eventually sold a partial share to captain Phil Harris. His share is currently in possession of his estate. The ship was seen (but not named) in background footage for the two pilots of the Discovery Channel series Deadliest Catch. It was selected for a camera crew for Season 1, in the 2004 opilio crab season, as partner vessel of featured vessel Maverick. The ship took part in the rescue efforts for the Big Valley, which sunk on the first day of the opilio crab season off Saint Paul Island, losing all but one crewmember.

It is home to the Penn State Nittany Lions of the Big Ten Conference since 1960, though some parts of the stadium date back to 1909. The stadium, as well as its predecessors, is named after James A. Beaver, a former governor of Pennsylvania (1887ÿ91) and president of the university's board of trustees.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeaver Stadium has an official seating capacity of 106,572,[5] making it currently the second largest stadium in the Western Hemisphere and the third largest in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeaver Stadium is widely known as one of the toughest venues for opposing teams in collegiate athletics. In 2008, Beaver Stadium was recognized as having the best student section in the country for the second consecutive year.[6] In 2016, it was voted the number-one football stadium in college football in a USA Today poll, garnering over 41 percent of the vote[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium is the first to have its interior included in Google Street View.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 1893, Penn State teams participated in sporting events on Old Main lawn, a large grassy area in front of the primary classroom building of the time. Beaver Field, a 500-seat structure located behind the current site of the Osmond Building, was the first permanent home for Penn State's football team, and the first game played there was a Penn State victory over Western University of Pennsylvania (now the University of Pittsburgh) on November 6, 1893. In 1909, New Beaver Field opened just northeast of Rec Hall, roughly in the current location of the Nittany Parking deck. It served as Penn State's stadium until 1960, when the entire 30,000 seat stadium was dismantled and moved to the east end of campus, reassembled and expanded to 46,284 seatsthe lower half of the current facilityand dubbed Beaver Stadium.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium has been expanded six times, reflecting Penn State's rise to national prominence under Joe Paternomore than doubling in size in the process. Expansions in 1972 brought capacity to 57,538. Another expansion in 1976 increased capacity to 60,203. In 1978, 16,000 seats were added when the stadium was cut into sections and raised on hydraulic lifts, allowing the insertion of seating along the inner ring of the stadium where the track had previously been located, raising capacity to 76,639. In 1980, maximum capacity increased to 83,770. In 1985, walkways were added around the tops of the end zones and entry ramps at the stadium's corners resulted in lowering the capacity to 83,370. An expansion was completed for the 1991 football season, placing an upper deck addition over the north end zone and raising capacity to 93,967.\\r\\n\\r\\nA major and somewhat controversial construction project took place in 2001, raising the stadium's total capacity to 107,282. An upper deck was added to the south end of the stadium, blocking the view of neighboring Nittany Mountain (which had sentimental value for some fans), but making Beaver Stadium the second largest stadium in the nation, behind Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, MI.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, the stadium underwent major structural and aesthetic upgrades. Old steel beams supporting the upper seats in the east, north and west were replaced and strengthened, and new railing was installed, stronger than the old railing which collapsed following the 2005 Ohio State game.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, over 22,000 student tickets sold out in 59 minutes. In 2008, when tickets were sold by grade, tickets allotted for junior students sold out in 90 seconds, and those for sophomores and freshmen sold out in under three minutes each.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, the stadium capacity was reduced from 107,282 seats to 106,572 to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe appearance of the stadium has been enhanced with the addition of large blue letters spelling out \\"The Pennsylvania State University\\" on the west-facing suites, and a list of Penn State's undefeated, national championship, and Big Ten championship years underneath. 2012 is the exception, which was added to this list during the November 24, 2012 game against Wisconsin to honor the team that played after sanctions were passed down during the aftermath of the Jerry Sandusky scandal. On the opposite side of the stadium, letters spelling, \\"Penn State Nittany Lions\\" have been added to the press box, with \\"Beaver Stadium\\" running below. Nine markers depicting the various traditions of Beaver Stadium, including the Blue Band, the student section, and the blue buses which bring the team to the stadium, have been placed around the stadium as well. In late October, the walls surrounding the field were refaced with Pennsylvania limestone. An iron gate has replaced the old chain-link face at the players' entrance into the stadium. On the new gate the words \\"PENN STATE\\" appear in blue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Penn State Office of Physical Plant and Athletic Department expanded  the North and South Video Boards to make them high definition and because parts were no longer available for the old boards.The area of the new video screens dedicated to game replays and game-related video is much larger than the screens they replaced.  The two video boards together are some of the largest in college football.  The renovation expanded the size of the video boards by eliminating the current game clock and lamp matrix display. The boards are only the second of their kind made and are 4k UHD. The project was completed prior to the first home game of the 2014 season. The boards cost approx. $10 million. Also on the back of both boards is a nittany lion logo that lights up at night and was added to promote the \\"Penn State Brand\\". Starting with the 2015 season fireworks are shot off from the top of each scoreboard when the team takes the field.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fall semester of 2015, University Officials stated that they are seeking options to renovate or replace Beaver Stadium in the next 10 years.[10] Officials state that there is a recognized need in an upgrade in the facilities. The stadium remains antiquated, despite multiple expansions and the additions of luxury boxes and high-definition scoreboards. Outdated plumbing requires complete winterization each November. Elevators are small and sluggish while concourses are narrow. The stadium lacks concession options and still uses bleachers. The limitations prevent wider use of the venue; the university would like to expand the number of events held at Beaver Stadium, such as major concerts and a long-discussed potential hosting of the NHL Winter Classic. Many fans are opposed to replacing Beaver Stadium due to the history and tradition but many agree that there is a need for renovation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeaver Stadium's record crowd of 110,889 witnessed Penn State's 27-26 loss against Ohio State on September 29, 2018. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, Penn State also set an NCAA record for largest season attendance, with 1,257,707 watching Penn State games over the course of the season.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Penn State community boasts that during home games at State College the stadium is the 4th largest city by \\"population\\" in the state. It follows Philadelphia (1,517,550), Pittsburgh (334,563), Allentown (118,032), and precedes Erie (101,786).\\r\\n\\r\\nTailgating is very popular outside Beaver Stadium. Alcohol is permitted in all areas around Beaver Stadium on home football games, except inside Beaver Stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center (Alcohol is permitted inside Medlar Field at Lubrano Park, but only alcohol purchased inside the ballpark). Both the Bryce Jordan Center and Medlar Field at Lubrano Park are open for special events before kickoff during home football games.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"S-Zone\\" within the student section is another tradition at Beaver Stadium.[13][14] A small section behind the end zone are all given white and blue shirts supplied by the Pennsylvania State University Lion Ambassadors to create an \\"S\\" in the student section. The \\"S-zone\\" was moved from the 20 yard line to its current location at the beginning of the 2011 football season, as the student section was shifted over to between the 10 yard lines. For the 2008, 2011, and 2013 Homecoming Games, the \\"S-zone\\" was black and pink, in honor of the original Penn State colors. On April 21, 2007, for the Annual Blue and White Game (Spring Scrimmage), the \\"S\\" zone was converted to a \\"VT\\" zone, in honor of the victims of the massacre that took place on April 16, 2007, at Virginia Tech.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter failed experiments with \\"Code Blue\\" during the down year of 2004, a localized version of the \\"Winnipeg White Out\\" made national headlines during the famed 2005 game versus Ohio State. In this game, despite 40?F (4?C) temperatures and a misty rain, nearly every student, along with many other fans, wore a white shirt to the game, creating a sea of white.[15] This was deemed a success, as the student section was declared \\"the best in the country\\" by ESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit, and the Nittany Lions won the game in an intense defensive battle, 17ÿ10. The student section was widely credited with aiding the defense, which kept the Buckeyes' future Heisman Trophy winning quarterback, Troy Smith, in check by intercepting a pass and recovering a decisive fumble in the final minutes. Smith was forced to call several timeouts during the game due to inability to communicate with his offense on the field. Former Ohio State Center Nick Mangold has openly admitted that Beaver Stadium was the toughest stadium he had ever played in[citation needed].\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, for the Notre Dame game, a full-stadium \\"White House\\" was declared. While it is widely believed that this change was a result of the National Hockey League's Phoenix Coyotes notifying the university that the phrase \\"White Out\\" was trademarked by the franchise during their time as the Winnipeg Jets,[16] the \\"White House\\" moniker was invented to remind the crowd that everyone, and not just the student section, was to wear white.[15] The newly christened \\"White House\\" was also deemed a success, as nearly every Penn State fan in attendance wore white, and the Lions won, 31ÿ10. In 2008, the White House was met with similar success, a 38ÿ24 win over Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nZombie Nation is a tradition carried out by the Nittany Lions usually after a big play. Zombie Nation is when the entire Penn State crowd jumps around, waves their rally towels or shakers wildly, and shouts \\"WE ARE PENN STATE\\" during the playing of \\"Kernkraft 400\\" by Zombie Nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tunnel entrance is a Nittany Lions tradition in which the head coach leads the team from the locker room under the South side of the stadium to the tunnel to a closed metal gate reading \\"PENN STATE\\" in bold Arial font. When the team arrives at the gate, the Nittany Lion would open the gate and motion for the team to walk through it, as if welcoming the team to the field. The team would then linger until four minutes were left on the pregame clock, and then the head coach leads the team through the tunnel created by the Blue Band.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Penn State Student Section initiates a wave during sporting events. After the wave passes around the stadium twice, the student section slows down the wave to about a fourth the speed of the normal wave. After the slow wave passes, the wave speeds up to over twice the speed of the normal wave. The wave has, on occasion, been reversed in direction following the fast wave.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Penn State Blue Band has entered the field, and played the first 8 bars of \\"Hail to the Lion,\\" the Blue Band's Drum Major does a high-stepping, stiff-legged sprint in between rows of band members from the goal line to the 50 yard line, where he does a front flip. Legend states that if the drum major lands the flip, the team will win that afternoon. He then performs another flip while running towards the end zone. After he stands back up, he and the Nittany Lion, who is holding his baton, take 5 high-steps toward each other, meeting 5 yards deep in the end zone. The Lion and Drum Major both place both hands on the baton in alternating order (in the same manner children choosing teams with a baseball bat would) and then throw the baton into the ground. They then salute each other, embrace arms, and then both excitedly run towards the student section, where they are cheered enthusiastically.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blue Band performs \\"Hail to the Lion\\" and makes its way from its \\"PSU\\" formation to roll into spelling \\"LIONS\\" as it marches across the field. Once reaching the other side, the band reverses the \\"LIONS\\" to be readable to the East side of the stadium, while playing \\"Fight On, State.\\" This is known as the \\"trademark drill\\" of the Blue Band.\\r\\n\\r\\n Media related to Beaver Stadium at Wikimedia Commons","input":"How many seats are in penn state stadium?"},{"output":"South Bend, Indiana","context":"The 2017 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team represents the University of Notre Dame in the 2017 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The team is coached by Brian Kelly and plays its home games at Notre Dame Stadium in South Bend, Indiana. They compete as an independent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2016 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team finished the regular season with a 4ÿ8 record, unable to make into a bowl game.\\r\\nThe following former Notre Dame players were selected in the 2017 NFL Draft:\\r\\nDepartures\\r\\nAdditions\\r\\nThe Fighting Irish signed a total of 21 recruits.\\r\\nSources:\\r\\nQuarterbacks\\r\\nRunning Backs\\r\\nWide Receivers\\r\\nTight Ends\\r\\nPunters\\r\\nOffensive lineman\\r\\nDefensive lineman\\r\\nKickers\\r\\nLinebackers\\r\\nCornerbacks\\r\\nSafeties\\r\\nDefensive Backs\\r\\nLong snappers\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Irish offense racked up 606 yards of offense including 422 of it from rushing. They finished with three players with over a 100 rushing yards: Josh Adams (161 yards), Dexter Williams (124 yards) and quarterback Brandon Wimbush (106 yards) all hit the century mark rushing as the Irish win big on opening day.\\r\\nFighting Irish quarterback Brandon Wimbush rushed for 270 yards with four touchdowns; the most rushing yards by a Notre Dame quarterback, a school record. Also, running back Josh Adams rushed for 229 yards in three quarters. This is the first time in Notre Dame football history that two players have rushed for more than 200 yards in a single game.\\r\\nThe Irish would score on their opening drive, a 7 play, 78 yard drive that was capped off by Quarterback Brandon Wimbush's 16 yard touchdown run. Notre Dame would add to their lead three minutes later with a 59-yard interception return for a touchdown by cornerback Julian Love go to up 14ÿ0 over the Spartans. The Irish defense forced three turnovers in the game, all of them the Irish turned into touchdowns. The Irish offense racked up 5.8 yards per play, including rushing for 182 yards against the Spartans defense that came into the game in the top 10 in rush defense.\\r\\nThe Fighting Irish would welcome No. 11 USC in a highly anticipated game. The Irish defense started the game forcing a USC turnover on the Trojans first offensive play of the game, and that would be a sign of things to come from the rest of the game as the Irish forced three total turnovers and would take a commanding 28ÿ0 lead by halftime. Running back Josh Adams had 191 rush yards and three touchdowns, including an 84-yard score in the third quarter. The Irish would rush for a total of 377 yards and averaged 8 yards per rush during the game. With this victory, Notre Dame earned the largest margin of victory in the series with USC in a half century. The last time was 51ÿ0 in Los Angeles in 1966.\\r\\nComing into the game, North Carolina State had a six-game win streak, along with the Irish who had a five-game win streak. The talk coming into the game was who would have the advantage. Would it be North Carolina State's stout run defense (ranked 6th in the country) or Notre Dame's dangerous rush offense (ranked 6th in the country). The first quarter saw both offenses struggle to move the ball, but the Wolfpack got on the board first with a blocked punt returned that was recovered in the end zone to give North Carolina State a 7-0 lead. Notre Dame responded in quick fashion with a 2-play, 60-yard drive that was capped off with a touchdown pass by Irish Quarterback Brandon Wimbush, who threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Durham Smyth. The two teams traded scores in the 2nd quarter but the Irish would take a 21-14 lead with another touchdown pass by Brandon Wimbush, this time an 11-yard pass to wide receiver Kevin Stepherson. Before the first half ended, the Wolfpack were threatening to score, as they had the ball at the Irish 35. But on 3rd and 10, the Irish were able to get a sack on quarterback Ryan Finley to push the Wolfpack out of field goal range. That play would seem to set the stage for the rest of the game. After halftime, the Irish started to take control with a 69-yard interception return for a touchdown by Irish cornerback Julian Love giving the Irish a two touchdown lead. Josh Adams put the game away for good with a 77-yard touchdown run late in the 3rd quarter.\\r\\nJosh Adams finished the game with 202 rush yards and the Irish as a team finished the game with 318 rush yards. That was more than twice as many rush yards that the Wolfpack defense had allowed on the year, as the previous most was 133 rush yards by Furman. This was the sixth straight game the Irish had won by 20 points or more. This was also the first time since 2012 that the Irish had two wins over opponents ranked in the top 15 in a season and the first time since 1989 that they did it in consecutive weeks . It was also the sixth time the Irish ran for 300 yards or more in a game this season.\\r\\nThough the Irish defense gave up a season high 580 yards of offense and 37 points, the offense was dominant. The Irish rushed for 380 yards and racked up 710 total yards of offense, 10 yards shy of tying the school record. This was the seventh time in nine games this season the Irish rushed for over 300 yards.\\r\\nIn a highly anticipated matchup, the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame and the Miami Hurricanes met in a crucial game that had major College Football Playoffs implications for the winner. Miami would prevail in a one-sided contest in which the Hurricanes defense shut down the high powered offense of Notre Dame, including Heisman candidate Josh Adams. Coming into the game, the Irish had just two turnovers in the previous six games, including no turnovers during that span when quarterback Brandon Wimbush started. They turned it over four times in the contest that was turned into 24 points for the Hurricanes. A pick six by Trajan Brady just before halftime gave Miami a commanding 27-0 lead at halftime and Notre Dame never recovered. The Irish had just 109 yards rushing (averaged 324 yards a game coming in), 8 points (averaged 41 points a game) and just 261 total yards of offense (averaged 440). With this loss, the Irish dropped out of the College Football conversation.\\r\\nAnother tough, competitive game between Notre Dame and Navy in this historic rivalry, as the Irish prevail 24-17. For Navy, after taking a 17-10 lead on a 12 yard touchdown pass from Zach Abey to Craig Scott in the 3rd quarter, Navy finished the game with a missed field, an interception and a turn over on downs, all in Irish territory. The Irish went up for good in the 4th quarter with a 9 yard touchdown pass from Brandon Wimbush to wide receiver Kevin Stepherson. A week after giving up 41 points, the Irish defense held Navy to just 17 points, despite Navy controlling the game clock 42:42 to 17:18.\\r\\nJosh Adams ran for 106 yards on 18 carries. Josh Adams topped 3,000 career yards and now has the 4th highest single season rushing total in Notre Dame history at 1,337. He needs 101 yards next weekend against Stanford to break the record.","input":"What state is notre dame football team from?"},{"output":"Mandarin","context":"Although Australia has no official languages, English has been entrenched as the de facto national language since European settlement.[1] Australian English is a major variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon,[2] and differs slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling.[3] General Australian serves as the standard dialect.\\r\\nAccording to the 2016 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for close to 70% of the population.

Atlanta was granted a franchise in the National Hockey League (NHL) on June 25, 1997, and became the League's 28th franchise when it began play in the 1999ÿ2000 season. They were members of the Southeast Division of the NHL's Eastern Conference, and played their home games at Philips Arena in downtown Atlanta. The Thrashers qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs only once, during the 2006ÿ07 season in which they won the Southeast Division, but were swept in the first round by the New York Rangers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2011, the Thrashers were sold to Canadian-based ownership group True North Sports & Entertainment. The group moved the franchise to Winnipeg, Manitoba, which became the second incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets. The sale and relocation were approved by the NHL on June 21, 2011.[1] With the sale and relocation of the team, Atlanta became the first city in the NHL's modern era to have two ice hockey teams relocate to different cities. In both cases, the team moved from Atlanta to Canada; the city's previous NHL team (the Atlanta Flames) moved to Calgary, Alberta, in 1980 to become the Calgary Flames.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the departure of the International Hockey League (IHL)'s Atlanta Knights (1992 to 1996) to become the Quebec Rafales, the city of Atlanta was awarded an NHL franchise on June 25, 1997, as part of a four-team tiered expansion. This also included teams in Nashville, Columbus and St. Paul, in which each new franchise would begin play as its respective new arena was completed. The birth of the new franchise marked NHL hockey's return to Georgia, as the Atlanta Flames, established in 1972, departed for Canada in 1980 to become the Calgary Flames. The Flames had been the League's first foray into the southern U.S., and their failure discouraged further efforts to bring NHL hockey to the region for another decade.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nickname \\"Thrashers,\\" after Georgia's state bird, the brown thrasher, was selected from a fan poll. \\"Thrashers\\" had actually been runner-up to \\"Flames\\" in the poll (as a homage to the old Atlanta Flames), and Philips Arena, the Thrashers' new home, was built on the site of the former Omni, which had been home to the Flames. By coincidence, the first encampment (circa 1839) which would later become Atlanta was called Thrasherville, and a historical marker of this is located just down from the arena in front of the State Bar of Georgia (the former home of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newly formed Thrashers selected Patrik Stefan with the first overall selection and Luke Sellars with their 30th overall pick (second pick of the second round) in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft. However, the entire 1999 NHL Entry Draft was a major disappointment for the Thrashers, as all 11 of their draft picks were out of the NHL by the team's last season of existence; Stefan played the most games for the Thrashers from that draft, 414.[4] Their first two picks (Stefan and Sellars) were called two of the biggest disappointments in draft history; NHL.com listed Stefan as the worst first overall pick of all-time and Sellars (who played only one NHL game) as the worst 30th overall pick in NHL history.[5] This turn of events was a major surprise, as not only did the media hype Stefan as a franchise player, but hockey experts also considered then-Thrashers General Manager Don Waddell to be a man with excellent scouting ability.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thrashers played their first game on October 2, 1999, losing 4ÿ1 to the New Jersey Devils. Captain Kelly Buchberger scored the franchise's first goal in the loss and the team went on to finish their first season in last place in the Southeast Division, with a record of 14 wins, 61 losses and seven ties for a total of 39 points.\\r\\n\\r\\nAtlanta had the second overall pick in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft; this draft brought better results, as the player chosen with that pick, Dany Heatley, went on to become one of the team's best players. The team also had a fine choice in the 2001 Draft, with first overall pick Ilya Kovalchuk. Both Heatley and Kovalchuk played their first season in the NHL in 2001ÿ02; both players were named to the NHL All-Rookie Team and Heatley was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as the League's Rookie of the Year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early years of the Atlanta Thrashers saw a sharp increase of hockey fans in Atlanta. Ticket sales for Thrashers games averaged at 10,000 per night, with many of them being season tickets. The overall experience of a Thrasher's game was unique compared to other Atlanta teams. A section of the arena was dedicated to season ticket holders that called themselves the \\"Nasty Nest\\". The \\"Nasty Nest\\" would chant and shout at the opposing team to disrupt them while they played. The Thrashers also had two Thrasher bird heads that would face opposite to the scoreboard. The Thrasher heads would open their beaks to reveal a flamethrower, which would ignite when the team  scored a goal. It was at this time that the franchise adopted a motto \\"Believe in Blueland\\" which was often used in advertising.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 21, 2003, Time Warner, the owners of both the Thrashers and the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s Atlanta Hawks, sold both teams to Atlanta Spirit, LLC, a group consisting of businessmen based both in Atlanta and elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nTragedy struck the team just eight days after the sale, as star forward Dany Heatley crashed his Ferrari in a one-car accident that seriously injured both himself and Thrashers center Dan Snyder. Heatley suffered a broken jaw and arm, a sprained wrist and a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL); Snyder died five days later due to septic shock from his injuries.[6] The Thrashers dedicated their entire 2003ÿ04 season to Snyder's memory, and Thrashers players wore black patches with Snyder's number, 37, on their jerseys for the season. Heatley's blood alcohol content was below the legal limit, but his combination of speeding (he was driving an estimated 80 miles per hour) and recklessness led to criminal charges, which were later dropped. He eventually received three years' probation and community service.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nLed by captain Shawn McEachern, the Thrashers jumped quickly out of the gate with some notable highlights. Ilya Kovalchuk scored eight goals in the first seven games, including two hat-tricks, one in a 7ÿ2 rout of the Chicago Blackhawks and another in a come-from-behind victory against the Nashville Predators. Those comeback victories became a recurring sight throughout the season, as Atlanta pulled off stunning upsets over the Toronto Maple Leafs, Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators, as well as wins against the Los Angeles Kings and New York Islanders.\\r\\n\\r\\nEleven games into the season, the Thrashers were alone in first place atop both the Southeast Division and the NHL. Although they continued to play well, they could not keep up with the Tampa Bay Lightning, the eventual Stanley Cup champions, or other teams in the League. Boxing Day 2003 marked both a bright and dark day for the Thrashers. On that day, Heatley skated for the first time since his car accident with Snyder, but it also marked the last win for the Thrashers before an extended losing streak. From December 28 to February 11, the team went a dismal 2ÿ16ÿ3. However, fans were entertained regardless of the team's struggles. Kovalchuk became only the second Thrashers' player to score in the NHL All-Star Game (after Heatley).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Thrashers' playoff hopes were done for the year, they finished second in the Southeast Division to Tampa Bay and tenth in the Eastern Conference, only a handful of wins away from the Stanley Cup playoffs. Kovalchuk tied for the League lead in goals (41) with the Calgary Flames' Jarome Iginla and the Columbus Blue Jackets' Rick Nash. Goaltender Kari Lehtonen began his NHL career with four wins in four starts, including one shutout.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the start of the 2005ÿ06 season, the Thrashers signed several NHL veterans in the hopes of making the playoffs, including forwards Bobby Holik and Scott Mellanby, defenseman Jaroslav Modry and goaltender Mike Dunham. At the same time, however, they lost one of their brightest stars, as Heatley requested a trade in an attempt to leave behind memories of his tragic 2003 car accident. He was eventually swapped to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Marian Hossa (a four-time 30-goal scorer at the time of the trade) and Greg de Vries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2005ÿ06 season saw the Thrashers win a club-record 41 games, even with numerous goaltending injuries. Only a few minutes into the first game of the season, Kari Lehtonen pulled his groin, an injury that would keep him out for a good portion of the season. Veteran backup Mike Dunham, an experienced number-one netminder, stepped in, but also promptly injured himself only a few games later; this left only prospects Michael Garnett and Adam Berkhoel to tend goal. Journeyman goaltender Steve Shields was signed, but he too was injured within ten games. On April 6, Lehtonen was run into by Tampa Bay's Chris Dingman, injuring him yet again. The remainder of the season was left to Dunham. Garnett was injured in a game against the Washington Capitals. Dunham, who had started the game but was relieved by the young rookie after poor play, was forced back into action in the third period.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thrashers' 2006ÿ07 season began with the highest expectations in franchise history, even after the team's second-leading scorer, Marc Savard, departed as a free agent for the Boston Bruins. Veteran center Steve Rucchin, Niko Kapanen and Jon Sim were acquired in an effort to make up for the Savard loss. With NHL superstars Marian Hossa and Ilya Kovalchuk, as well as a healthy goaltender in Kari Lehtonen, the Thrashers clinched their first (and only) playoff berth, winning the Southeast Division title with 43 wins and claiming the third seed in the Conference and home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs. However, they were eliminated from the playoffs on April 18, being swept by the New York Rangers in four-straight games in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis season was the highest attended the Thrashers ever had, with every home playoff game sold out as well as the season opening and closing games. The team was gaining notoriety within the league for their playoff debut, and team popularity within Atlanta reached an all-time high. Even Hip-Hop artist Lil Jon expressed his support for the Atlanta Thrashers by wearing a Thrashers jersey while posing with the Stanley Cup. After this season, the Thrashers ticket sales would start dwindling due to the housing market crash of 2008, and a stale economy in Atlanta. Although the ticket sales dropped, the fans remained loyal throughout the decline of the team.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nJust months after reaching the playoffs for the first time, the Thrashers began the 2007ÿ08 season 0ÿ6. Consequently, they fired Head Coach Bob Hartley on October 17, 2007, with General Manager Don Waddell taking over behind the bench on an interim basis. The Thrashers ended the season with only 76 points, finishing 14th in the Eastern Conference.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 27, 2008, the Thrashers hosted the NHL All-Star Game at Philips Arena, matching the Eastern Conference All-Stars against the Western Conference All-Stars. The game had originally been scheduled for the 2004ÿ05 season, but the NHL lockout of that year, followed by the 2006 Winter Olympics the following season and the Dallas Stars' hosting of the 2007 NHL All-Star Game, made 2008 the earliest available date. The Eastern Conference won the game 8ÿ7, with former Thrasher Marc Savard scoring the game winner late in the third period. Although he was a member of the Bruins, the Atlanta crowd cheered Savard the entire night.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 20, 2008, John Anderson was named as the fourth head coach in Thrashers history. In his first season, the Thrashers matched their previous season with 76 points, while finishing 13th in the Eastern Conference. Simultaneously, Atlanta Spirit, LLC, the team's ownership group, was coming apart at the seams. A dispute between Steve Belkin and his seven fellow owners dated back to 2005; Belkin claimed the other owners breached their contract, giving him the right to buy them out at cost, while his partners said they should be able to buy out Belkin's 30% stake. On November 3, court proceedings began in Maryland to decide the group's fate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the final year of his contract, Ilya Kovalchuk and the Thrashers could not come to an agreement on an extension. General Manager Don Waddell reportedly offered 12-year, $101 million and seven-year, $70 million contracts, both of which Kovalchuk turned down. Rather than potentially losing him to free agency in the off-season, the team traded Kovalchuk on February 4, 2010, to the New Jersey Devils. Atlanta received defenseman Johnny Oduya, rookie forward Niclas Bergfors, junior prospect Patrice Cormier and a first-round pick in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for Kovalchuk and defenseman Anssi Salmela; the teams also traded second-round selections in 2010. The Thrashers finished tenth in the Conference, with 83 points, which would be the most points they had earned in a regular season from the time they won the division title in 2006ÿ07 to the team's eventual relocation in the summer of 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 14, 2010, three days after the finish of the 2009ÿ10 season and after two unsuccessful attempts at making the playoffs, the contracts of Head Coach John Anderson and his coaching staff were not renewed. General Manager Don Waddell was promoted to president of hockey operations, while former Assistant General Manager Rick Dudley took Waddell's place as general manager. This was the only general manager change in Thrashers history.\\r\\n\\r\\nDudley made his first trade on June 23, 2010, involving nine players and draft picks, with the Chicago Blackhawks. The Thrashers received Dustin Byfuglien, Ben Eager, Brent Sopel and Akim Aliu in exchange for Marty Reasoner, Joey Crabb, Jeremy Morin, the Devils' first-round pick (#24 overall) in 2010 and the Devils' second-round pick (#54 overall) in 2010. Later, the Thrashers also traded for Blackhawk Andrew Ladd while sending prospect Ivan Vishnevskiy and a draft pick to Chicago. The Blackhawks, the 2010 Stanley Cup champions, found it necessary to trade players for prospects and picks as they were in difficulty with the salary cap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, the team named Craig Ramsay as the team's new head coach. Ramsay, who had been an assistant coach for the Boston Bruins for the previous three seasons, was a former NHL player who had been a teammate of Rick Dudley's on the Buffalo Sabres. In the following weeks, the Thrashers hired an associate coach, John Torchetti, and an assistant coach, Mike Stothers. The team also hired Clint Malarchuk as a goaltending consultant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thrashers' last win came against the New York Rangers, 3ÿ0 at Madison Square Garden on April 7, 2011. On April 10, 2011, the Thrashers played their last game in Atlanta against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Tim Stapleton scored the last goal in Thrashers history in a 5ÿ2 loss to Pittsburgh. The final NHL goal scored in Philips Arena was tallied by the Penguins' Mike Comrie, an empty net goal and his first of the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to financial losses and ownership struggles, the team was frequently a target of relocation rumors. In later years, reports saw the team courted by suitors intending to relocate to Kansas City; Quebec City; Hamilton, Ontario, or Winnipeg.[8][9][9] On January 22, 2011, the team's ownership group claimed it had lost US$130 million in the last six years, partially as a result of an ongoing lawsuit with former partner Steve Belkin.[10] In February 2011, majority owner Michael Gearon stated that the team would be seeking new investors.[11] Various local groups announced their intent to purchase the franchise and keep it in Atlanta,[12][13] but ultimately the team was sold to the Canadian group True North Sports & Entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 16, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that talks for a sale to True North Sports & Entertainment were underway.[14] According to The Globe and Mail, a deal was finalized on May 20, 2011, to relocate the team to Winnipeg.[15] The League later denied the report, but acknowledged that advanced negotiations between the two teams were underway and that NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman supported the move.[16] Draft schedules were prepared that accommodated for the team's move to Winnipeg,[17] as True North sought to move the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League (AHL), eventually moving the team to St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, in Atlantic Canada.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 31, 2011, True North Sports & Entertainment and the NHL held a press conference in Winnipeg to announce the completion of a deal to purchase the Thrashers. True North intended to relocate the team to the MTS Centre in Winnipeg and on June 21, 2011, both the sale and relocation of the team were formally approved by the NHL's Board of Governors. The Atlanta Spirit Group, however, retained the rights and logos for the Thrashers.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Thrashers.

In addition to play's eponymous protagonists, Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, the play contains roles for members of their respective families and households; Prince Escalus, the city's ruler, and his kinsman, Count Paris; and various unaffiliated characters such as Friar Laurence and the Chorus. In addition the play contains two ghost characters (Petruchio and Valentine) and an unseen character (Rosaline).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Escalus, the Prince of Verona, is the desperate resolver of the feuding families. He is based on the actual Scaligeri family which ruled Verona, possibly on Bartolomeo I. Escalus is the voice of authority in Verona. He appears only three times within the text and only to administer justice following major events in the feud between the Capulet and Montague families. He first punishes Capulet and Montague for the quarrel between Tybalt, Benvolio, and a handful of servants. He returns too late to stop the fatal brawls between Tybalt and Mercutio and, subsequently, Tybalt and Romeo. Escalus is prepared to execute Romeo for his offenceRomeo's killing Tybaltbut lightens the sentence to lifetime banishment from Verona, when Benvolio insists that Tybalt started the quarrel by murdering Mercutio, a kinsman to the prince. He yells at Lord Montague for engaging in the feud, which really is the root cause which led to Tybalt killing Mercutio. Prince Escalus returns in the final sceneV.iiifollowing the double suicide of Romeo and Juliet, and at last declares the Lords Montague and Capulet guilty of Romeo and Juliet's death, and angrily tells them that their totally useless feud resulted in the deaths of not only their own loved ones (Lady Montague, Romeo, Juliet, and Tybalt), but also in the deaths of Escalus' loved ones (Mercutio and Paris). He curses the feud that kills Romeo and Juliet whom he really feels sad for, just before the Lords come to peace with each other. In the end, Prince Escalus becomes very happy that the feud has finally ended, even if with a heavy price, since it ended late.\\r\\nCount Paris is a kinsman of Prince Escalus and seeks to marry Juliet. He is described as handsome, somewhat self-absorbed, and very wealthy.\\r\\nParis makes his first appearance in Act I, Scene II, where he expresses his wish to make Juliet his wife and the mother of his children. Capulet demurs, citing his daughter's young age as a reason and telling him to wait until she is more mature. (Paris disagrees, however.) Nevertheless, Capulet invites Paris to attend a family ball being held that evening and grants permission to woo and attract Juliet. Later in the play, however, Juliet refuses to become Paris' \\"joyful bride\\" after her cousin Tybalt dies by her new husband Romeo's hand, proclaiming that she now wants nothing to do with Paris. Her parents threaten to disown (or cut ties with) her if she will not agree to the marriage. Then, while at Laurence's cell at the church, Paris tries to woo her by repeatedly saying that she is his wife and that they are to be married on Thursday. He kisses her and then leaves the cell, prompting Juliet to angrily threaten to kill herself with a knife. His final appearance in the play is in the cemetery where Juliet is \\"laid to rest\\" in the Capulet family tomb. Believing her to be dead, Count Paris has come to mourn her death in solitude and privacy and sends his manservant away. He professes his love to Juliet, saying he will nightly weep for her (Act V, Scene III). Shortly thereafter, Romeo arrives. Paris sees him and thinks he is trying to vandalise the tomb, so he tries to arrest him. They fight, and Romeo kills Paris. Romeo grants Paris' dying wish to be placed next to Juliet in the tomb.\\r\\nMercutio is the cousin of Prince Escalus and Count Paris, and is a close friend of Romeo and his cousin Benvolio. He supports and fights on the Montague side of the feud, and just like a Montague, hates the Capulet family. The invitation to the Capulet's party reveals that he has a brother named Valentine. Mercutio is apt to make long, drawn out speeches (the most famous of which is the Queen Mab speech), and is generally thought to be reckless, a jester, and a free spirit. Due to his reckless and flamboyant personality, Mercutio is one of Shakespeare's most popular characters. Mercutio is the instigator of many fights with his rather mean spirited humor, and often insults Tybalt, a renowned swordsman. It is Tybalt's temper that leads to Mercutio's death, and Romeo's banishment and the tragedy that follows.\\r\\nAfter Romeo receives a death threat from Tybalt, Mercutio expects Romeo to engage Tybalt in a duel. However, Romeo refuses to fight Tybalt, as Tybalt is Juliet's cousin and therefore his kinsman. Not knowing this, Mercutio is incensed, and decides to fight Tybalt himself. Romeo, not wanting his best friend or his relative to get hurt, intervenes, causing Mercutio to be killed by Tybalt stabbing under Romeo's arm.\\r\\nBefore he dies, Mercutio casts \\"a plague o' both your houses!\\" He makes one final pun before he dies: \\"Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man\\". In revenge for the murder of his best friend, Romeo slays Tybalt, thus leading to Romeo's banishment from Verona and the increasingly tragic turn of events that follows.\\r\\nAnother page accompanies Paris to the Capulet's crypt when he goes to mourn Juliet. He stands guard as Paris enters, ordered to \\"whistle then to me, / As signal that thou hear'st something approach\\". When Romeo and Paris break into a brawl, the page runs away to call the Watch. He returns with the Watch too late to stop the fray and later testifies to the Prince of Paris' intentions.\\r\\nThe Capulet family (in Italian, \\"Capuleti\\") in the play was named after an actual political faction of the 13th century.[1] Notably, the Capulet family is often portrayed as the 'bad' side, as much of the conflict is caused by them. They are also more developed, since more attention is given to their family life.\\r\\nLord Capulet is the patriarch of the Capulet family, the father of Juliet, and uncle of Tybalt. He is very wealthy. He is sometimes commanding but also convivial, as at the ball: when Tybalt tries to duel with Romeo, Capulet tries to calm him and then threatens to throw him out of the family if he does not control his temper; he does the same to his daughter later in the play.\\r\\nCapulet's ultimatum to Juliet, Romeo and Juliet[2]\\r\\nCapulet believes he knows what is best for Juliet. He says his consent to the marriage depends upon what she wants and tells Count Paris that if he wants to marry Juliet he should wait a while then ask her. Later, however, when Juliet is grieving over Romeo's departure, Capulet thinks her sorrow is due to Tybalt's death, and in a misguided attempt to cheer her up, he wants to surprise her by arranging a marriage between her and Count Paris. The catch is that she has to be \\"ruled\\" by her father and to accept the proposal. When she refuses to become Paris' \\"joyful bride\\", saying that she can \\"never be proud of what she hates\\", Capulet becomes furious; threatens to make her a street urchin; calls her a \\"hilding\\" , \\"unworthy\\", \\"young baggage\\", a \\"disobedient wretch\\", a \\"green-sickness carrion\\", and \\"tallow-face\\"; and says God's giving Juliet to them was a \\"curse\\" and he now realises he and his wife had one child too many when Juliet was born (in the earlier poem The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet). In addition to threatening to turn her out, he threatens to sentence her to rot away in prison if she does not obey her parents' orders. He then storms away, and his wife also rejects Juliet before following him. He fixes the day of the marriage for Thursday and suddenly advances it to Wednesday out of anger and impulse. His actions indicate that his daughter's wants were irrelevant all the way up to the point when he sees her unconscious on her bed (presumably dead) and later, when she is truly dead during the play's final scene. It is he who asks Lord Montague for his hand to end the feud between their families.\\r\\nCapulet's wife is the matriarch of the house of Capulet and Juliet's mother. She plays a larger role than Montague's wife, appearing in several scenes. In Act 1, Scene 3, she speaks to Juliet about the marriage of her daughter and Paris, we see this as she compares him to a book, and Juliet is the cover. However, in Scene four, she is pleased about Count Paris' \\"interest\\" in her daughter. When Tybalt is killed in Act 3, she expresses extreme grief and a strong desire for revenge on Romeo by wishing death upon him. In Act 3, Scene 5, she becomes very angry with Juliet for refusing to marry Paris and coldly rejects her, saying: \\"Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word; do as thou wilt, for I am done with thee\\". By the final act, she is nearly overcome by the tragic events of the play, this is where the grief-stricken mother comes out.[3] We know Juliet's mother bore her first child by the time she was 14, Juliet's age, and her husband is many years older than she. Calling her \\"Lady Capulet\\" is a modern addition; it is an echo of Juliet's form of address in 3.5.65: \\"my lady mother\\".[4] In the first texts the stage direction and speech headings can be \\"mother\\", \\"wife\\", or even \\"old lady\\", but nowhere \\"Lady Capulet\\".[4]\\r\\nJuliet Capulet, the female protagonist, is the only daughter of Capulet, the patriarch of the Capulet family. As a child she was cared for by a Nurse, who is now her confidante.\\r\\nJuliet dies at the end of the play, and the sacred lovers are reunited on the same deathbed. Both their families realise what they had done by trying to separate the star crossed lovers with the effect that the Capulets and Montagues are reunited and their fighting ends.\\r\\nTybalt is the son of Lady Capulet's brother and Juliet's hot-headed first cousin. As a skilled swordsman, he serves as the story's principal antagonist. Tybalt is angered by the insult of Romeo and Benvolio's uninvited presence at the ball in the Capulets' home. Tybalt shares the same name as the character Tibert/Tybalt the \\"Prince of Cats\\" in Reynard the Fox, a point of both mockery and compliment to him in the play. While Mercutio repeatedly calls Tybalt \\"Prince of Cats\\" (referring to Tybalt's speed and agility with the sword), Mercutio is also insulting Tybalt ÿ the phrase refers not only to Reynard but to the Italian word cazzo (pr. CAT-so) meaning \\"penis.\\r\\nTybalt is first seen coming to the aid of his servants who are being attacked by the Montagues' servants. He is also present at Capulet's feast in act one, scene five and is the first to recognise Romeo. His last appearance is in act 3 scene 1, wherein Mercutio insults Tybalt and ends up fighting with him. Tybalt kills Mercutio and, in retaliation, Romeo rages and kills Tybalt, resulting in Romeo's banishment.\\r\\nThe Nurse is a major character in the play, and like the Friar she is a neutral character. There has been speculation about her name, as Capulet refers to as \\"Angelica\\", but the line can be addressed to either the nurse or Lady Capulet. She is the personal servant (and former nurse) of Juliet's. As the primary person who raised Juliet, she is Juliet's confidante and effectively more of a mother to the girl than Lady Capulet. She was also the one who breastfed Juliet as a child.[5]\\r\\nPeter is the personal servant of the Nurse's. He appears to be a loyal servant, always quick to obey the Nurse. He is chastised for not fighting Mercutio for the Nurse's honour, but insists that he \\"saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, / my weapon should quickly have been out\\".[6] He appears again in act four, scene five in a brief comic relief scene with a number of musicians.\\r\\nGregory and Sampson are the Capulet servants. Gregory is originally hesitant to start a fight. Sampson, however, bites his thumb at Abram, \\"Which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it\\". The Montagues then retaliate in earnest. Benvolio arrives to break up the fight but ends up fighting with Tybalt. Both Gregory and Sampson appear to be friends of their master Tybalt's.[7]\\r\\nIn the opening scene, the two engage in a dialogue full of puns on \\"coal\\" and \\"eye\\", each intending to outdo the other and get each other ready to fight Montagues. The rhetorical form is called stychomythia, wherein characters participate in a short, quick exchanges of one-upmanship. Their discussion and brawl in this scene set the stage for the rivalry and hatred which fills the rest of the play.[7]\\r\\nAnthony, Potpan, and two other servants to the Capulet family play out a short comic scene in act one, scene five, arguing over the preparations for Capulet's feast. Capulet's servants are referenced again in act four, scene one; Capulet orders them to begin preparations for another party: the wedding of Juliet and Paris.\\r\\nA servant to Capulet is sent to deliver party invitations to a number of nobles and friends to Capulet. While walking, he comes upon Romeo and Benvolio and asks them to read the list for him, as he cannot read. As a thank you, he invites the boys to \\"come and crush a cup of wine,\\" not realising that they are Montagues. This character may have been intended to be the same as Peter, and is usually identified in scripts either as Peter or as a Clown.\\r\\nOld Capulet is Capulet's cousin. He appears as an elderly man sitting with Capulet in the feast.\\r\\nThe Montague family (in Italian, \\"Montecchi\\") was an actual political faction of the 13th century.[1] The Montagues are generally portrayed as the 'better' of the two families, as they are not seen to be provoking fights and are often found trying to avoid fighting whenever they could, and occasionally found trying to dissuade the fighters to return to peace.\\r\\nThe father of Romeo. Presumably, he is also wealthy, and is always in feud with Capulet. Montague clearly loves his son deeply and at the beginning of the play, worries for him as he recounts to Benvolio his attempts to find out the source of his depression. He wishes Benvolio better luck. After Romeo kills Tybalt, Montague pleads with the Prince to spare him of execution as Romeo did only what the law would have done, since Tybalt killed Mercutio. He appears again at the end of the play to mourn Romeo, having already lost his wife to grief.\\r\\nMontague's wife is the matriarch of the house of Montague, and the mother of Romeo and aunt of Benvolio. She appears twice within the play: in act one, scene one she first restrains Montague from entering the quarrel himself, and later speaks with Benvolio about the same quarrel. She returns with her husband and the Prince in act three, scene one to see what the trouble is, and is there informed of Romeo's banishment. She dies of grief offstage soon after (mentioned in act five). She is very protective of her son Romeo and is very happy when Benvolio tells her that Romeo was not involved in the brawl that happened between the Capulets and Montagues. However, Romeo doesn't feel very close to her as he is unable to seek advice from her. As with Capulet's wife, calling her \\"Lady Montague\\" is a later invention not supported by the earliest texts.\\r\\nIn the beginning of the play, Romeo pines for an unrequited love, Rosaline. To cheer him up, his cousin and friend Benvolio and Mercutio take him to the Capulets' celebration in disguise, where he meets and falls in love with the Capulets' only daughter, Juliet. Later that night, he and Juliet meet secretly and pledge to marry, despite their families' long-standing feud. They marry the following day, but their union is soon thrown into chaos by their families; Juliet's cousin Tybalt duels and kills Romeo's friend Mercutio, throwing Romeo into such a rage that he kills Tybalt, and the Prince of Verona subsequently banishes him. Meanwhile, Juliet's father plans to marry her off to Paris, a local aristocrat, within the next few days, threatening to turn her out on the streets if she doesn't follow through. Desperate, Juliet begs Romeo's confidant, Friar Laurence, to help her to escape the forced marriage. Laurence does so by giving her a potion that puts her in a deathlike coma. The plan works, but too soon for Romeo to learn of it; he genuinely believes Juliet to be dead, and so resolves to commit suicide, by drinking the bottle of poison (illegally bought from the Apothecary upon hearing the news of Juliet's \\"death\\"). Romeo's final words were \\"Thus with a kiss I die\\".[8] He kills himself at Juliet's grave, moments before she awakes; she kills herself in turn shortly thereafter.\\r\\nHe is Montague's nephew and Romeo's cousin. Benvolio and Romeo are both friends of Mercutio, a kinsman to Prince Escalus. Benvolio seems to have little sympathy with the feud, trying unsuccessfully to back down from a fight with Tybalt, and the duels that end in Mercutio and Tybalt's death. Benvolio spends most of Act I attempting to distract his cousin from his infatuation with Rosaline, but following the first appearance of Mercutio in I.iv, he and Mercutio become more closely aligned until III.i. In that scene, he drags the fatally wounded Mercutio offstage, before returning to inform Romeo of Mercutio's death and the Prince of the course of Mercutio's and Tybalt's deaths. Benvolio then disappears from the play (though, as a Montague, he may implicitly be included in the stage direction in the final scene \\"Enter Lord Montague and others\\", and he is sometimes doubled with Balthasar). Though he ultimately disappears from the play without much notice, he is a crucial character if only in that he is the only child of the new generation from either family to survive the play (as Romeo, Juliet, Paris, Mercutio, and Tybalt are dead).\\r\\nBalthasar is Romeo's servant and trusted friend. They have a brotherly relationship, which is identified when Balthasar tells Romeo that Juliet is \\"dead.\\" While he is not directly referenced in the first scene of the play, the directions call for two Montague servants to quarrel with Sampson and Gregory. He then comes back in Act V Scene 1 telling Romeo about Juliet's death. Later Friar Laurence runs past Balthasar and asks him where Romeo is. Balthasar tells him that he is inside the tomb. Then the Prince calls him in and asks him questions about why was he there. He gives the Prince the letter that explains why Juliet killed herself.\\r\\nAbram is a servant of the Montague household. He appears in Act 1, Scene 1, where he and another servant (presumably Balthasar) are provoked into a fight with Gregory and Sampson when the latter bites his thumb at them.\\r\\nFriar Lawrence plays the part of an advisor and mentor to Romeo, along with aiding in major plot developments.\\r\\nAlone, the innocent Friar gives us foreshadowing with his soliloquy about plants and their similarities to humans.[9] When Romeo requests that the Friar marry him to Juliet, he is shocked, because only days before, Romeo had been infatuated with Rosaline,[10] a woman who did not return his love. Nevertheless, Friar Lawrence decides to marry Romeo and Juliet in the attempt to end the civil feud between the Capulets and the Montagues.[11]\\r\\nWhen Romeo is banished[12] and flees to Mantua for murdering Tybalt[13] (who had previously murdered Mercutio), he tries to help the two lovers get back together using a death-emulating potion to fake Juliet's death.[14] The Friar's letter to Romeo does not reach him because the people of Mantua suspect the messenger came from a house where the plague reigns,[15] and the Friar is unable to arrive at the Capulet's monument in time. Romeo kills Count Paris,[16] whom he finds weeping near Juliet's corpse, then commits suicide,[17] by drinking poison that he bought from an impoverished apothecary,[18] over what he thinks is Juliet's dead body. Friar Lawrence arrives just as Juliet awakes from her chemically induced slumber.[19] He urges Juliet not to be rash, and to join a society of nuns,[20] but he hears a noise from outside and then flees from the tomb. Juliet then kills herself with Romeo's dagger, completing the tragedy. The Friar is forced to return to the tomb, where he recounts the entire story to Prince Escalus, and all the Montagues and Capulets. As he finishes, the prince proclaims, \\"We have still known thee for a holy man\\".\\r\\nFriar John calls at the door of Friar Laurence's cell, \\"Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!\\" (5.2.1). Friar Laurence comes out and immediately asks about Romeo: \\"Welcome from Mantua! What says Romeo? / Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter\\" (5.2.3ÿ4). Friar John explains that he sought out another friar for company and found him in a house where he was visiting the sick, whereupon the health authorities, fearing there was pestilence in the house, confined both friars in the house so they wouldn't infect others. The authorities wouldn't even allow Friar John to use a messenger to send the letter back to Friar Laurence.\\r\\nA Chorus gives the opening prologue and one other speech, both in the form of a Shakespearean sonnet.\\r\\nThe Chorus is an omniscient character. It appears at the top of the play to fill the audience in on the ancient quarrel between the, \\"Two households, both alike in dignity / In fair Verona, where we lay our scene\\". It returns as a prologue to act two to foreshadow the tragic turn of events about to befall the new romance between the title characters.\\r\\nThe Chorus only appears in the Quarto versions, not in the First Folio.\\r\\nThe Apothecary is a pharmacist in Mantua who reluctantly sells Romeo's poison, only because he's poor and is also in desperate need of monetary support.\\r\\nThe Watch of Verona takes the form of three watchmen. The First Watch appears to be the constable, who orders the Second and Third to \\"search about the churchyard!\\" Unusual for a Shakespearean watch group, they appear to be a relatively intelligent unit, managing to capture and detain Balthasar and Friar Laurence in the churchyard. They then testify to the Prince to their role in the murder and suicide scene.\\r\\nThree musicians for Juliet's wedding appear in act four, scene five in a brief comic scene, refusing to play a song called \\"Heart's ease\\" for Peter. They are referred to by the names of Simon Catling, Hugh Rebeck, and James Soundpost.[21]\\r\\nA number of citizens emerge during Act I, Scene I to break apart the fight between some Capulet and Montague servants. They appear again in Act III, Scene I to discover the slain body of Tybalt, at which point they place Benvolio under citizen's arrest until the Prince's swift entrance.\\r\\nPetruchio is a guest at the Capulet feast. He is notable only in that he is the only ghost character confirmed by Shakespeare to be present. When the party ends and Juliet inquires towards Romeo's identity, the Nurse attempts to avoid the subject by answering that Juliet is pointing at \\"the young Petruchio\\". Later, he is with Tybalt when he fatally wounds Mercutio, and a few scripts identify a Capulet with one line by that name. Petruchio is also the name of a major character in Shakespeare's earlier work, The Taming of the Shrew.\\r\\nRosaline is an unseen character and niece of Capulet. Although silent, her role is important: her lover, Romeo, first spots her cousin Juliet while trying to catch a glimpse of Rosaline at a Capulet gathering.\\r\\nBefore Juliet, Romeo was deeply intrigued with another woman that didn't return his feelings. Scholars generally compare Romeo's short-lived love of Rosaline with his later love of Juliet. Rosaline means \\"fair rose\\". The poetry he writes for Rosaline is much weaker than that for Juliet. Scholars believe his early experience with Rosaline prepares him for his relationship with Juliet. Later performances of Romeo and Juliet have painted different pictures of Romeo and Rosaline's relationship, with filmmakers experimenting by making Rosaline a more visible character.\\r\\nValentine is Mercutio's brother, briefly mentioned as a guest at the Capulet feast where Romeo and Juliet meet. He is a ghost character with no speaking parts, and his only possible appearance is at the Capulet feast among the guests. \\"Valentine\\" has been taken to mean \\"lover\\" or \\"brother\\", and is associated with these attributes in several stories and histories. Scholars have pointed out that Valentine is more strongly connected to a major character than other ghosts, as he is given a direct connection to his brother. Although he has a very small role in Shakespeare's play, earlier versions of the story gave him no role or mention at all. In fact, they gave even Mercutio a very minor role. Shakespeare was the first English dramatist to use the name \\"Valentine\\" on stage, in his earlier plays, Titus Andronicus and Two Gentlemen of Verona. In Titus, Valentine plays a minor role, but in Two Gentlemen, he is one of the title characters. Incidentally, the Valentine of Two Gentlemen borrows heavily from Arthur Brooke's Romeus in The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet, which Shakespeare later used to create Romeo and Juliet. Brooke's version made Mercutio a rival for Juliet's love. Shakespeare's addition of Valentine as Mercutio's brother diffuses this rivalry. Thus, because the first time we hear of Mercutio he is associated with Valentine, rather than Juliet, he is changed from a rival to a friend and brotherly figure of Romeo.[22]","input":"What family does paris belong to in romeo and juliet?"},{"output":"Thailand","context":"","input":"What is the country of siam called today?"},{"output":"Quebec French","context":"Dialects of the French language are spoken in France and around the world.

Note that the discussion here refers to varieties of the French language, not to the Romance sister languages (sometimes considered dialects) of French spoken in France (e.g. Picard, Limousin, Gascon, etc.; for these languages see: Langues d'o?l, Francoproven?al, Occitan and languages of France). See also French-based creole languages, which are also considered separate languages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench is an administrative language and is commonly but unofficially used in the Maghreb states, Mauritania, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. As of 2006, an estimated 115 million African people spread across 31 African countries can speak French either as a first or second language, making Africa the continent with the most French speakers in the world.[1] While there are many varieties of African French, common features include the use of an alveolar trill and use of borrowed words from local languages.\\r\\nAcadian French is a variant of French spoken by francophone Acadians in the Canadian Maritime provinces, the Saint John River Valley in the northern part of the U.S. state of Maine, the Magdalen Islands and Havre-Saint-Pierre, along the St. Lawrence's north shore. Speakers of Metropolitan French and even of other Canadian dialects have some difficulty understanding Acadian French.\\r\\nNotable features include /k/ and /tj/ becoming [t??] and // and /dj/ becoming [d??] before front vowels and the use of some archaic words.\\r\\nChiac is a dialect of combined Acadian French and English and is spoken mainly around Moncton, New Brunswick. The pronunciation of French words by is very different from other dialects and resembles English pronunciation. Chiac cannot be identified solely on its frequent use of English words since many other French dialects use many English words as well, but Chiac has an unusual amount of English. Chiac French has developed through proximity to English-speakers who settled nearby during the colonial period. Sounds that are characteristic of Chiac are the different use of the letters \\"d\\", \\"t\\", \\"r\\", and \\"c\\" (such as the word \\"bec\\", normally spoken in French with a softer \\"c\\" sound but spoken as \\"beck\\" with a hard \\"c\\" as in the English pronunciation). Other differences include the use of vowel sounds such as \\"ea\\", \\"eo\\", \\"on\\", \\"an\\", and \\"oi\\". Such English-stylized pronunciations are different from other dialects of North American French such as Qubcois and Brayon. Some forms of Chiac deviate from the original language to the extent that it is nearly incomprehensible to the larger francophone community. Chiac is perhaps best categorized as a creole language alongside Haitian Creole (of Haiti) and Louisiana Creole (of Louisiana), French dialects that incorporate Indigenous, African, and other European languages, as opposed to dialects such as Qubcois and Brayon that deviate slightly from Metropolitan French but are nonetheless derived primarily from earlier dialects of French with little contribution from other source languages.\\r\\nNewfoundland French is a regional dialect of French that was once spoken by settlers in the French colony of Newfoundland.\\r\\nQuebec French is the dominant and most prevalent regional variety of French found in Canada. Although Quebec French constitutes a coherent and standard system, it has no objective norm since the very organization mandated to establish it, the Office qubcois de la langue fran?aise, believes that objectively standardizing Quebec French would lead to reduced interintelligibility with other French communities around the world.[citation needed]\\r\\nOntario French is often divided into two categories: North and South. The further north the more French is spoken and the closer the dialect and culture is to Quebec French. The further south, the French becomes a more pronounced French with a more English cultural influence as well as a Parisian grammar and dialect structure, as both Parisian and Canadian French are taught in the French immersion schools.\\r\\nNotable features include [?], [?], and [?] as allophones of /i/, /y/, and /u/ in closed syllables and affrication of /t/ and /d/ to [t?s] and [d?z] before /i/ and /y/ (the word tu is pronounced [t?sy]).\\r\\nLong vowels are generally diphthongized in closed syllables (the word fte is pronounced [fa??t]).\\r\\nSeveral varieties of French emerged in the United States: Louisiana French, New England French and the nearly-extinct Frenchville French, Missouri French, Muskrat French and Mtis French.\\r\\nLouisiana French, the largest of the groupings, is spoken mostly in Louisiana and derives from the forms of the language spoken by the colonists of lower French Louisiana. Louisiana French is traditionally into three dialects: Colonial French, Modern Louisiana French or \\"Acadian\\" French, and Louisiana Creole French.[2][3] Colonial French was originally the dialect spoken by the land-holding educated classes. Acadian, the dialect of the Acadians who came to French Louisiana in droves following their expulsion from Acadia during the French and Indian War, was spoken largely by the white lower classes. Louisiana Creole, a creole that developed long before Haitian immigrants arrived in Louisiana, largely developed as the tongue of the Louisiana Creole community and a significant portion of self-identified Cajuns. However, linguists now believe that the Colonial and Acadian dialects have largely merged into modern Louisiana French but remain distinct from Louisiana Creole.[3]\\r\\nFrench has gained co-official status with English in Louisiana, and there is both a thriving multi-generational base of speakers as well as a growing network of French immersion schools across the state in order to preserve the language. Louisiana also has a French-language society called CODOFIL (Conseil pour le dveloppement du fran?ais en Louisiane).\\r\\nMissouri French is now spoken by a handful of people in the Midwestern United States, primarily in Missouri. It is the last remnant of the form of French once spoken widely in the region known as the Illinois Country, which was colonized as part of French Louisiana. It is considered very moribund, with only a few elderly speakers still fluent.[2]\\r\\nNew England French is the local name for Canadian French as it is spoken in New England,[4] except in the Saint John Valley of northern Aroostook County, Maine, where Acadian French predominates.\\r\\nHaitian French is the variety of French spoken in Haiti.[5] The main difference between Haitian French and the Metropolitan French is in the Haitian speaker's intonation, a rather subtle creole-based tone being used.[5] Importantly, differences are not enough cause problems between both speakers.[5]\\r\\nCambodian French is the French of Cambodia. It dates back to the French colonization of Indochina in 1863. Colonists taught French to the local inhabitants, especially the Khmer and Chinese. The locals also taught the colonists Khmer and some Chinese spoken variants, such as Teochew and Cantonese. Cambodian French was influenced by Khmer and Chinese spoken variants, and it was spoken by children of French men married to Khmer or ethnic Chinese women.\\r\\nCambodian French is still used as a second language in some schools, universities and government offices, but most of the younger generations and members of the business world choose to learn English. Mostly, only older natives still speak French. Since the 1990s, there has been a small revival of French in Cambodia with French-language schools and centres opening. Many Cambodian students travel to France to receive studies as well as French-language media.[6] Nevertheless, Cambodia still has the smallest Francophone population of the three French-speaking Asian countries, the others being Vietnam and Laos.\\r\\nIndian French is the French spoken by Indians in the former colonies of Pondichry, Chandannagar, Karaikal, Mah and Yanam. There is a considerable influence from Dravidian languages like Tamil (Puducherry Tamil dialect), Telugu (Yanam Telugu dialect) and Malayalam (Mah Malayalam dialect).\\r\\nLao French is spoken in Laos. It goes back to the French colonization of Indochina despite a decline in the language after the country's independence and the communist takeover. A revival has now raised the number of students learning French to 35%.[6] In addition, the Laotian lite and the elderly population speak French, which is the diplomatic language of Laos.\\r\\nVietnamese French is spoken in Vietnam, which has the largest Francophone population in Asia. Over 5% of the population learn the language or speak it well.[6] French is also spoken among the elderly in Vietnam as a legacy of the colonial French era and also by the country's lite. A French pidgin, Tay B?i, was spoken by Vietnamese servants in French households during the colonial era. Since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, the number of French-speakers in Vietnam and the number of students taking the language have declined, but French remains taught as an optional foreign language in higher education.\\r\\nAostan French (French: fran?ais vald?tain) is the variety of French spoken in the Aosta Valley of Italy, where there is a significant trilingual francophone population. Some expressions, words and phrases are different from Standard French, some of them are similar to Swiss French and some reflecting the influence of Piedmontese language or Italian. Both French and Italian overlay the indigenous local language continuum of Aosta Valley, called Vald?tain (locally, patois), which is Franco-Proven?al in type.\\r\\nBelgian French (French: fran?ais de Belgique) is the variety of French spoken mainly in the French Community of Belgium, alongside related minority regional languages such as Walloon, Picard, Champenois and Gaumais. Belgian French and the French of northern France are almost identical.\\r\\nNotable features include a strong distinction between long and short vowels, the lack of the approximant /?/, and the use of certain Belgicisms.\\r\\nJersey Legal French is the official dialect of French used administratively in Jersey. Notable features include some archaic word choices and the words septante and nonante for \\"seventy\\" and \\"ninety\\" respectively.\\r\\nMeridional French (French: fran?ais mridional) is the regional variant of the French spoken in Occitania. It is strongly influenced by Occitan.\\r\\nSwiss French (French: fran?ais de Suisse, Suisse romand) is the variety of French spoken in the French-speaking area of Switzerland known as Romandy. The differences between Swiss French and Parisian French are minor and mostly lexical.","input":"What type of french is spoken in canada?"},{"output":"February 22, 2018","context":"The West Virginia teachers' strike began on February 22, 2018 with a call from the West Virginia branches of the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association for teachers across West Virginia to strike. The strike, called in response to anger among teachers and other school employees over low pay and high health care costs, involved roughly 20,000 teachers and public school employees and shut down schools in all 55 West Virginia counties, affecting some 250,000 students. It lasted until March 7, 2018.[1][2]\\r\\nThe strike inspired teachers in other states, including Oklahoma, Colorado, and Arizona, to take similar action.[3] Teachers in other states, including North Carolina and Kentucky have also coordinated protests and walkouts on a smaller scale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strike was called in response to the low pay of West Virginia teachers, whose compensation ranks 48th in the United States.[4][5] The strike also responded to a pay raise passed by the legislature and signed by Governor Jim Justice that provided only a 2% raise for 2019, and 1% raise for 2020 and a 1% raise for 2021 and a freeze on premiums for 16 months to benefits. The teachers' unions did not release vote totals for the strike. Every public school district in the state closed to avoid confrontations. It was the first such strike since 1990.[6] According to some analysts, West Virginia teachers had a stronger negotiating position in the strike because many teaching positions remain unfilled.[7] Teachers say that because of low pay in West Virginia, the state has difficulty attracting and retaining teachers.[8]\\r\\nOne of the major issues involved funding for the Public Employees Insurance Agency, the state health insurance plan. The West Virginia Legislature had voted to boost state contributions to the plan by using a percentage of the annual state surplus, but the teachers' unions were demanding a more reliable financing plan.[9][7] Health care costs have increased quickly enough that proposed teacher pay increases cannot match teacher payments for health care.[7]\\r\\nThe work stoppage took place in defiance of state law forbidding public employee strikes. On February 21, the day before the walkout, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey warned that a strike \\"of any length on any ground is illegal and said his office would support local districts attempting to enforce the state ban on public employee strikes.[10] Nonetheless, on the same day, Governor Justice signed into law a bill offering teachers a 2% pay increase. \\"We need to keep our kids and teachers in the classroom, Gov. Justice said in signing the law. We certainly recognize our teachers are underpaid and this is a step in the right direction to addressing their pay issue.\\"[11] Teachers said that the 2% pay raise, and subsequent raises of 1% slated for 2020 and 2021, would not keep up with inflation.[1]\\r\\nTeachers rejected the pay raise, walking out across the state on February 22. The same day, a crowd estimated at 5,000 demonstrated at the West Virginia State Capitol.[12][13]\\r\\nThe strike continued on February 23, as all schools in the state were closed once again. Teachers and other workers rallied in front of the West Virginia State Capitol as well as picketed in front of individual schools. West Virginia teachers have a stronger negotiating position in the strike because many teaching positions remain unfilled.[7]\\r\\nA deal reached by union leaders and Governor Jim Justice was announced on February 27, and union leaders called on teachers and other education-related personnel to return to classrooms on Thursday March 1, after a \\"cooling off\\" period.[14] However, during the late evening on February 28, every county announced school closures due to continuing work stoppages, and by this point the stoppage had become a wildcat strike.[15] On March 3, the West Virginia Senate rejected a bill passed by the West Virginia House of Delegates approving the agreed upon 5% pay rise, instead proposing a 4% pay rise, extending the strike into an eighth work day.[16]\\r\\nA similar strike was proposed by teachers in Oklahoma, where teacher compensation is worse than in West Virginia, at 49th in the United States.[17][7][4] On Sunday March 4, 1,400 West Virginia Frontier Communications workers went on strike in response to company restructuring, also citing rising health care costs, and the example of the Teacher's Strike.[18]\\r\\nWest Virginia school personnel returned to classrooms on Wednesday March 7 after the State Senate agreed to the House's position following conference committee negotiations. The strike, while achieving a 5% pay raise, did not provide guarantees to control rising health care costs.[7]\\r\\nJustice and other Republican lawmakers opposed the strike and asserted that the teachers' absence from the classroom were hurting school children. He also said there was not enough money to fund teachers' demands. Im telling you when we should do more is when we know we can do more,\\" Justice said on February 23. \\"Today we think we can do more, but we dont know. Our teachers need to be in the classroom. The Legislature has spoken and Ive signed it into law.[19] Justice, a billionaire coal magnate, won election in 2016 as a Democrat with the endorsements of the AFT-WV and the WVEA, along with other unions in the state. He subsequently switched to the Republican Party.[20]\\r\\nUnion officials sought backing from prominent state Democratic Party leaders, inviting them to speak at teachers' demonstrations during the strike. However, prior to the strike, Democrats had control the governors mansion for 32 of the previous 40 years. They controlled the governor's mansion and the legislature between 2001-2014.[21][22]\\r\\nThe strike was noteworthy because it emerged from rank-and-file teachers, who began to demand statewide strike action. Pressure to strike was \\"coming from everywhere,\\" Christine Campbell, AFT-WV president, said in early February. These demands coalesced into a series of rallies and demonstrations held throughout the state.[23] Ultimately the strike became a wildcat when teachers refused back-to-work orders from the unions.[24]\\r\\nThe World Socialist Web Site, daily publication of the Socialist Equality Party, which published many interviews with teachers, argued that the AFT-WV and WVEA would settle the strike on unfavorable terms to school employees.[25][26] It called on teachers to form rank-and-file committees independent of the trade unions and to broaden the strike to include teachers in other states and other groups of workers in West Virginia.[27]\\r\\nThe Industrial Workers of the World issued a press release, demanding that the strike continue unless a series of demands were met, including a tax on natural gas production to fund state education.[24]","input":"When did the west virginia teacher strike start?"},{"output":"Arabic","context":"","input":"What is the national language of saudi arabia?"},{"output":"116,927","context":"Parker County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas.

Delivered to over 250,000 civil rights supporters from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the speech was a defining moment of the Civil Rights Movement.[2]\\r\\nBeginning with a reference to the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed millions of slaves in 1863,[3] King observes that: \\"one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free\\".[4] Toward the end of the speech, King departed from his prepared text for a partly improvised peroration on the theme \\"I have a dream\\", prompted by Mahalia Jackson's cry: \\"Tell them about the dream, Martin!\\"[5] In this part of the speech, which most excited the listeners and has now become its most famous, King described his dreams of freedom and equality arising from a land of slavery and hatred.[6] Jon Meacham writes that, \\"With a single phrase, Martin Luther King Jr. joined Jefferson and Lincoln in the ranks of men who've shaped modern America\\".[7] The speech was ranked the top American speech of the 20th century in a 1999 poll of scholars of public address.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom was partly intended to demonstrate mass support for the civil rights legislation proposed by President Kennedy in June. Martin Luther King and other leaders therefore agreed to keep their speeches calm, also, to avoid provoking the civil disobedience which had become the hallmark of the Civil Rights Movement. King originally designed his speech as a homage to Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, timed to correspond with the 100-year centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation.[6]\\r\\nKing had been preaching about dreams since 1960, when he gave a speech to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) called \\"The Negro and the American Dream\\". This speech discusses the gap between the American dream and reality, saying that overt white supremacists have violated the dream, and that \\"our federal government has also scarred the dream through its apathy and hypocrisy, its betrayal of the cause of justice\\". King suggests that \\"It may well be that the Negro is God's instrument to save the soul of America.\\"[9][10] In 1961, he spoke of the Civil Rights Movement and student activists' \\"dream\\" of equality\\"the American Dream ... a dream as yet unfulfilled\\"in several national speeches and statements, and took \\"the dream\\" as the centerpiece for these speeches.[11]\\r\\nOn November 27, 1962, King gave a speech at Booker T. Washington High School in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. That speech was longer than the version which he would eventually deliver from the Lincoln Memorial. And while parts of the text had been moved around, large portions were identical, including the \\"I have a dream\\" refrain.[12][13] After being rediscovered,[14] the restored and digitized recording of the 1962 speech was presented to the public by the English department of North Carolina State University.[12]\\r\\nMartin Luther King had also delivered a \\"dream\\" speech in Detroit, in June 1963, when he marched on Woodward Avenue with Walter Reuther and the Reverend C. L. Franklin, and had rehearsed other parts.[15]\\r\\nThe March on Washington Speech, known as \\"I Have a Dream Speech\\", has been shown to have had several versions, written at several different times.[16] It has no single version draft, but is an amalgamation of several drafts, and was originally called \\"Normalcy, Never Again\\". Little of this, and another \\"Normalcy Speech\\", ended up in the final draft. A draft of \\"Normalcy, Never Again\\" is housed in the Morehouse College Martin Luther King Jr. Collection of the Robert W. Woodruff Library, Atlanta University Center and Morehouse College.[17] The focus on \\"I have a dream\\" comes through the speech's delivery. Toward the end of its delivery, noted African American gospel singer Mahalia Jackson shouted to King from the crowd, \\"Tell them about the dream, Martin.\\"[18] King departed from his prepared remarks and started \\"preaching\\" improvisationally, punctuating his points with \\"I have a dream.\\"\\r\\nThe speech was drafted with the assistance of Stanley Levison and Clarence Benjamin Jones[19] in Riverdale, New York City. Jones has said that \\"the logistical preparations for the march were so burdensome that the speech was not a priority for us\\" and that, \\"on the evening of Tuesday, Aug. 27, [12 hours before the march] Martin still didn't know what he was going to say\\".[20]\\r\\nLeading up to the speech's rendition at the Great March on Washington, King had delivered its \\"I have a dream\\" refrains in his speech before 25,000 people in Detroit's Cobo Hall immediately after the 125,000-strong Great Walk to Freedom in Detroit, June 23, 1963.[21][22] After the Washington, D.C. March, a recording of King's Cobo Hall speech was released by Detroit's Gordy Records as an LP entitled \\"The Great March To Freedom\\".[23]\\r\\nWidely hailed as a masterpiece of rhetoric, King's speech invokes pivotal documents in American history, including the Declaration of Independence, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the United States Constitution. Early in his speech, King alludes to Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address by saying \\"Five score years ago...\\" In reference to the abolition of slavery articulated in the Emancipation Proclamation, King says: \\"It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.\\" Anaphora (i.e., the repetition of a phrase at the beginning of sentences) is employed throughout the speech. Early in his speech, King urges his audience to seize the moment; \\"Now is the time\\" is repeated three times in the sixth paragraph. The most widely cited example of anaphora is found in the often quoted phrase \\"I have a dream\\", which is repeated eight times as King paints a picture of an integrated and unified America for his audience. Other occasions include \\"One hundred years later\\", \\"We can never be satisfied\\", \\"With this faith\\", \\"Let freedom ring\\", and \\"free at last\\". King was the sixteenth out of eighteen people to speak that day, according to the official program.[24]\\r\\nAmong the most quoted lines of the speech include \\"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. I have a dream today!\\"[26]\\r\\nAccording to U.S. Representative John Lewis, who also spoke that day as the president of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, \\"Dr. King had the power, the ability, and the capacity to transform those steps on the Lincoln Memorial into a monumental area that will forever be recognized. By speaking the way he did, he educated, he inspired, he informed not just the people there, but people throughout America and unborn generations.\\"[27]\\r\\nThe ideas in the speech reflect King's social experiences of ethnocentric abuse, the mistreatment and exploitation of blacks.[28] The speech draws upon appeals to America's myths as a nation founded to provide freedom and justice to all people, and then reinforces and transcends those secular mythologies by placing them within a spiritual context by arguing that racial justice is also in accord with God's will. Thus, the rhetoric of the speech provides redemption to America for its racial sins.[29] King describes the promises made by America as a \\"promissory note\\" on which America has defaulted. He says that \\"America has given the Negro people a bad check\\", but that \\"we've come to cash this check\\" by marching in Washington, D.C.\\r\\nKing's speech used words and ideas from his own speeches and other texts. For years, he had spoken about dreams, quoted from Samuel Francis Smith's popular patriotic hymn \\"America\\" (\\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\\"), and of course referred extensively to the Bible. The idea of constitutional rights as an \\"unfulfilled promise\\" was suggested by Clarence Jones.[9]\\r\\nThe final passage from King's speech closely resembles Archibald Carey Jr.'s address to the 1952 Republican National Convention: both speeches end with a recitation of the first verse of \\"America\\", and the speeches share the name of one of several mountains from which both exhort \\"let freedom ring\\".[9][30]\\r\\nKing also is said to have used portions of Prathia Hall's speech at the site of a burned-down African American church in Terrell County, Georgia, in September 1962, in which she used the repeated phrase \\"I have a dream\\".[31] The church burned down after it was used for voter registration meetings.[32]\\r\\nThe speech also alludes to Psalm 30:5[33] in the second stanza of the speech. Additionally, King quotes from Isaiah 40:4ÿ5 (\\"I have a dream that every valley shall be exalted...\\"[34]) and Amos 5:24 (\\"But let justice roll down like water...\\"[35]). He also alludes to the opening lines of Shakespeare's Richard III (\\"Now is the winter of our discontent / Made glorious summer...\\") when he remarks that \\"this sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn...\\"\\r\\nThe \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech can be dissected by using three rhetorical lenses: voice merging, prophetic voice, and dynamic spectacle.[36] Voice merging is the combining of one's own voice with religious predecessors. Prophetic voice is using rhetoric to speak for a population. A dynamic spectacle has origins from the Aristotelian definition as \\"a weak hybrid form of drama, a theatrical concoction that relied upon external factors (shock, sensation, and passionate release) such as televised rituals of conflict and social control.\\"[37]\\r\\nVoice merging is a common technique used amongst African American preachers. It combines the voices of previous preachers and excerpts from scriptures along with their own unique thoughts to create a unique voice. King uses voice merging in his peroration when he references the secular hymn \\"America.\\"\\r\\nThe rhetoric of King's speech can be compared to the rhetoric of Old Testament prophets. During King's speech, he speaks with urgency and crisis giving him a prophetic voice. The prophetic voice must \\"restore a sense of duty and virtue amidst the decay of venality.\\"[38] An evident example is when King declares that, \\"now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.\\"\\r\\nWhy King's speech was powerful is debated, but essentially, it came at a point of many factors combining at a key cultural turning point. Executive speechwriter Anthony Trendl writes, \\"The right man delivered the right words to the right people in the right place at the right time.\\"[39]\\r\\n\\"Given the context of drama and tension in which it was situated\\", King's speech can be classified as a dynamic spectacle.[40] A dynamic spectacle is dependent on the situation in which it is used. It can be considered a dynamic spectacle because it happened at the correct time and place: during the Civil Rights Movement and the March on Washington.\\r\\nThe speech was lauded in the days after the event, and was widely considered the high point of the March by contemporary observers.[41] James Reston, writing for The New York Times, said that \\"Dr. King touched all the themes of the day, only better than anybody else. He was full of the symbolism of Lincoln and Gandhi, and the cadences of the Bible. He was both militant and sad, and he sent the crowd away feeling that the long journey had been worthwhile.\\"[9] Reston also noted that the event \\"was better covered by television and the press than any event here since President Kennedy's inauguration\\", and opined that \\"it will be a long time before [Washington] forgets the melodious and melancholy voice of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. crying out his dreams to the multitude.\\"[42] An article in The Boston Globe by Mary McGrory reported that King's speech \\"caught the mood\\" and \\"moved the crowd\\" of the day \\"as no other\\" speaker in the event.[43] Marquis Childs of The Washington Post wrote that King's speech \\"rose above mere oratory\\".[44] An article in the Los Angeles Times commented that the \\"matchless eloquence\\" displayed by King\\"a supreme orator\\" of \\"a type so rare as almost to be forgotten in our age\\"put to shame the advocates of segregation by inspiring the \\"conscience of America\\" with the justice of the civil-rights cause.[45]\\r\\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which viewed King and his allies for racial justice as subversive, also noticed the speech. This provoked the organization to expand their COINTELPRO operation against the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and to target King specifically as a major enemy of the United States.[46] Two days after King delivered \\"I Have a Dream\\", Agent William C. Sullivan, the head of COINTELPRO, wrote a memo about King's growing influence:\\r\\nIn the light of King's powerful demagogic speech yesterday he stands head and shoulders above all other Negro leaders put together when it comes to influencing great masses of Negroes. We must mark him now, if we have not done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this Nation from the standpoint of communism, the Negro and national security.[47]\\r\\nThe speech was a success for the Kennedy administration and for the liberal civil rights coalition that had planned it. It was considered a \\"triumph of managed protest\\", and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred. Kennedy had watched King's speech on television and been very impressed. Afterwards, March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with President Kennedy. Kennedy felt the March bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.[48]\\r\\nMeanwhile, some of the more radical Black leaders who were present condemned the speech (along with the rest of the march)[citation needed] as too compromising. Malcolm X later wrote in his autobiography: \\"Who ever heard of angry revolutionaries swinging their bare feet together with their oppressor in lily pad pools, with gospels and guitars and 'I have a dream' speeches?\\"[6]\\r\\nThe March on Washington put pressure on the Kennedy administration to advance its civil rights legislation in Congress.[49] The diaries of Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., published posthumously in 2007, suggest that President Kennedy was concerned that if the march failed to attract large numbers of demonstrators, it might undermine his civil rights efforts.\\r\\nIn the wake of the speech and march, King was named Man of the Year by TIME magazine for 1963, and in 1964, he was the youngest person ever awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.[50] The full speech did not appear in writing until August 1983, some 15 years after King's death, when a transcript was published in The Washington Post.[4]\\r\\nIn 1990, the Australian alternative comedy rock band Doug Anthony All Stars released an album called Icon. One song from Icon, \\"Shang-a-lang\\", sampled the end of the speech.\\r\\nIn 1992, the band Moodswings, incorporated excerpts from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech in their song \\"Spiritual High, Part III. on the album Moodfood\\".\\r\\nIn 2002, the Library of Congress honored the speech by adding it to the United States National Recording Registry.[51] In 2003, the National Park Service dedicated an inscribed marble pedestal to commemorate the location of King's speech at the Lincoln Memorial.[52]\\r\\nThe Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial was dedicated in 2011. The centerpiece for the memorial is based on a line from King's \\"I Have A Dream\\" speech: \\"Out of a mountain of despair, a stone of hope.\\"[53] A 30 feet (9.1?m)-high relief of King named the \\"Stone of Hope\\" stands past two other pieces of granite that symbolize the \\"mountain of despair.\\"[53]\\r\\nOn August 26, 2013, UK's BBC Radio 4 broadcast \\"God's Trombone\\", in which Gary Younge looked behind the scenes of the speech and explored \\"what made it both timely and timeless\\".[54]\\r\\nOn August 28, 2013, thousands gathered on the mall in Washington D.C. where King made his historic speech to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the occasion. In attendance were former U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, and incumbent President Barack Obama, who addressed the crowd and spoke on the significance of the event. Many of King's family were in attendance.[55]\\r\\nOn October 11, 2015, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published an exclusive report about Stone Mountain officials considering installation of a new \\"Freedom Bell\\" honoring King and citing the speech's reference to the mountain \\"Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.\\"[56] Design details and a timeline for its installation remain to be determined. The article mentioned inspiration for the proposed monument came from a bell-ringing ceremony held in 2013 in celebration of the 50th anniversary of King's speech.\\r\\nOn April 20, 2016, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew announced that the U.S. $5 bill, which has featured the Lincoln Memorial on its back, would undergo a redesign prior to 2020. Lew said that a portrait of Lincoln would remain on the front of the bill, but the back would be redesigned to depict various historical events that have occurred at the memorial, including an image from King's speech.[57]\\r\\nIn October 2016 Science Friday in a segment on its crowd sourced update to the Voyager Golden Record included the speech.[58]\\r\\nBecause King's speech was broadcast to a large radio and television audience, there was controversy about its copyright status. If the performance of the speech constituted \\"general publication\\", it would have entered the public domain due to King's failure to register the speech with the Register of Copyrights. However, if the performance only constituted \\"limited publication\\", King retained common law copyright. This led to a lawsuit, Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. v. CBS, Inc., which established that the King estate does hold copyright over the speech and had standing to sue; the parties then settled. Unlicensed use of the speech or a part of it can still be lawful in some circumstances, especially in jurisdictions under doctrines such as fair use or fair dealing. Under the applicable copyright laws, the speech will remain under copyright in the United States until 70 years after King's death, therefore until 2038.[59]\\r\\nAs King waved goodbye to the audience, he handed George Raveling the original typewritten \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech.[60] Raveling, an All-American Villanova Wildcats college basketball player, had volunteered as a security guard for the event and was on the podium with King at that moment.[61] In 2013, Raveling still had custody of the original copy, for which he had been offered $3,000,000, but he has said he does not intend to sell it.[62][63]\\r\\nCoordinates: 385321.48N 7730.40W? / ?38.8893000N 77.0501111W? / 38.8893000; -77.0501111","input":"When did martin luther king jr give his speach?"},{"output":"Wheeler Peak","context":"Wheeler Peak is the highest natural point in the U.S. state of New Mexico. It is located northeast of Taos and south of Red River in the northern part of the state, and just 2 miles (3.2?km) southeast of the ski slopes of Taos Ski Valley. It lies in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the southernmost subrange of the Rocky Mountains. The peak's elevation is 13,167 feet (4,013?m).\\r\\n\\r\\nFormerly named Taos Peak, after the nearby town of Taos, New Mexico, it was renamed Wheeler Peak in 1950.[3] A plaque at the summit states that the mountain was:\\r\\n\\r\\nNamed in honor of Major George Montague Wheeler (1842ÿ1905) who for ten years led a party of surveyors and naturalists collecting geologic, biologic, planimetric and topographic data in New Mexico and six other southwestern states.\\r\\nJust north of Wheeler Peak is Mount Walter. At 13,141 feet (4,005?m) it is the second highest named summit in New Mexico, but it is not usually considered an independent peak as it has only about 53 feet (16?m) of topographic prominence. It is sometimes mistaken for Wheeler Peak, since it is along the standard route to Wheeler. Lake Fork Peak at 12,881 feet (3,926?m) lies just across Williams Lake and to the west of Wheeler Mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaos Ski Valley lies to the northwest of Wheeler Peak, while both the town of Taos and Taos Pueblo are about 15 miles (24?km) to the southwest. \\r\\n\\r\\nWheeler Peak is the focus of the 19,661-acre (79.57?km2) Wheeler Peak Wilderness area in the Carson National Forest. Much of the mountain area just south of the peak is on Taos Pueblo land. Some 48,000 acres (190?km2) was returned to the pueblo from the Carson National Forest in 1970[4]\\r\\nand another 764 acres (3.09?km2) in 1996.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe standard route on Wheeler Peak is along the north ridge. The route starts at the parking lot for Taos Ski Valley, and proceeds east along an old road to a broad saddle at Bull-of-the-Woods Meadow. It then turns south and winds its way among minor peaks and small valleys to gain Wheeler Peak from the north, going over the summit of Mount Walter along the way. This is a practical route, even in winter, due to low (but nonzero) avalanche exposure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn alternate route is to hike south from Taos Ski Valley to Williams Lake, then take a newly constructed switchback trail to the top.  This trail was completed in 2011 by a Forest Service trail crew from the Gallatin National Forest, 8 people working 12 hours per day, building 4 miles of new trail with hand tools to the top in 14 days.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother alternate route is to begin from the nearby ski resort of Red River.  From the town of Red River drive 6.4 miles south on NM 578, then 1.3 miles on FR 58 to the trailhead parking area.  From the parking area Wheeler peak is about 7 miles on Forest Trail 91.

Created by Disney Consumer Products chairman Andy Mooney in the early 2000s, the franchise features a line-up of fictional female protagonists who have appeared in various Disney franchises.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe franchise does not include all princess characters from the whole of Disney-owned media, but rather refers to specific characters from the company's animated films. As of  2018[update], the eleven characters considered part of the franchise are Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora, Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, Pocahontas, Mulan, Tiana, Rapunzel, and Merida.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe franchise has released dolls, sing-along videos, apparel, home decor, toys, and a variety of other products featuring some of the Disney Princesses.[5] Licensees for the franchise include Glidden (wall paint), Stride Rite (sparkly shoes), Hasbro (games and dolls), and plastic Fisher-Price figurines.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nMooney, on his creation of the Disney Princess franchise as reported by The New York Times[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer Nike, Inc. executive Andy Mooney was appointed chairman of The Walt Disney Company's Disney Consumer Products division in the late 1990s.[7][8] While attending his first Disney on Ice show, Mooney noticed that several young girls attending the show were dressed in princess attire that were not authentic Disney products.[9] \\"They were generic princess products theyd appended to a Halloween costume,\\" Mooney told The New York Times. Concerned by this, Mooney addressed the company the following morning and encouraged them to commence work on a legitimate Disney Princess franchise in January 2000.[7] Walt's nephew, Roy E. Disney, objected to the creation of the line, as the company has long \\"avoided mingling characters from its classic fairy tales in other narratives, worrying that it would weaken the individual mythologies\\".[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original line-up consisted of princesses Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora, Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, Pocahontas, Mulan and Tinker Bell. Tinker Bell was soon removed from the latter category and the overall line-up. This was the first time the characters would be marketed in a separate franchise than their original films. Mooney decided that, when featured on marketing advertisements such as posters, the princesses should never make eye contact with each other in an attempt to keep their individual \\"mythologies\\" intact. \\"[Each] stares off in a slightly different direction as if unaware of the others' presence.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an unconventional manner, Mooney and his team launched the Disney Princess line without utilizing any focus groups and with minimal marketing. By 2001, Disney Consumer Products (DCP) generated about 300 million dollars, but by 2012, the division had increased revenue to 3 billion dollars, making it the top seller of consumer entertainment products globally.[10] DCP issued princess product licenses to Hasbro for games, Mattel dolls, and plastic Fisher-Price figurines in 2000, allowing the franchise to meet the $1 billion mark in revenue in three years.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nTiana became the first additional character to the Princess franchise officially on March 14, 2010, taking Tinker Bell's short-lived place as the ninth member. Her \\"coronation\\" took place at the New York Palace.[11] Tinker Bell was already heading up another franchise started in 2005, Disney Fairies.[12] Rapunzel was crowned and inducted into the Disney Princess franchise as the tenth member on October 2, 2011, at Kensington Palace in London, England.[13] On May 11, 2013, Disney added the first Pixar character Merida as the 11th Princess to the franchise in a coronation ceremony in front of Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Target Corporation as its marketing partner, Disney held the first National Princess Week the week of April 22, 2012. During the week, there was the release of The Princess Diaries Blu-ray and The Very Fairy Princess book.[14] Harrod, already have a Disney stores within, followed with their Christmas theme being Disney Princess by having Oscar de la Renta designed dress for the Princess on display.[15] In August, the dress were on display at D23 Expo before being auctioned on November 13 to benefit Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nMattel adding a Barbie princess-themed line in late-2010 then the fair and fantasy store based Ever After High in 2013. Mattel was only putting out Princesses Cinderella, Ariel and Belle plus Anna and Elsa during the last year or so of its license. With these competing lines and an expiration of the brand license at the end of 2015, Disney gave Hasbro a chance to gain the license given their work on Star Wars which lead to a Descendants license. DCP was also attempting to evolve the brand by making them less as damsels and more as heroines. In September 2014, Disney announced that Hasbro would be the licensed doll maker for the Disney Princess line starting on January 1, 2016.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe June 2013 release of the Disney Princess Palace Pets app from Disney Publishing, led DCP to turn Palace Pets into a Disney Princess franchise extension, with the release of The Palace Pets toy line in August from licensee Blip Toys. The line was also selected by TimetoPlayMag.com for its Most Wanted List Holiday 2013.[1] In 2015 Disney Publishing released animated shorts series Whisker Haven Tales with the Palace Pets. The shorts journey to a magical world of Whisker Haven, a secret realm located in a fairy-tale space between the Disney Princess kingdoms.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincesses were given an official number in the franchise lineup starting with Snow White as the first and original Disney princess, with Cinderella being the second, followed by Aurora and so on.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow White is the first and original Disney Princess.[18] A main character in Walt Disney Animation Studios' 1st animated feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Snow White is a beautiful young princess, described by her evil stepmother's Magic Mirror as having 'hair as black as ebony, lips as red as the rose, skin as white as snow' and also dubbed by the Mirror as the 'Fairest Of Them All'.[19] She is forced to seek refuge in the home of the seven dwarfs where she hides from her evil stepmother, Queen Grimhilde, who got angered by the fact that Snow White's beauty was greater than hers. She asked the Huntsman to kill the princess; however, as an act of pity, he ends up setting her free and telling her the Evil Queen's plan. Snow White is often described as a kind, optimistic, tidy and happy person who sees the good in everyone. Originally voiced by Adriana Caselotti and animated by Marc Davis and Les Clark, she and her movie are based on the heroine and story of the German fairy tale Snow White (1812) by the Brothers Grimm. She has also been voiced by Mary Kay Bergman, Carolyn Gardener, and most recently Katherine Von Till. A crisp, blood red apple has become her trademark with years of exposure.\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow White is often known as one of the most anti-feminist Disney princesses through her passivity, her living with the Seven Dwarfs, her tendency to clean, and her awaiting of a prince to save her from her oppressions, which critics have viewed as misogyny and a danger to young women who will want to replicate these behaviors in their own lives.[20][21] While many argue that she was a reflection of the era in which she was created, others claim that the complexity of animation of the time made it too difficult to add complexity to the characters in the film. Janet Maslin of The New York Times claims, \\"Aside from her great daintiness and her credentials as a fervent housekeeper, Snow White has no distinct personality. She exists only to be victimized by her wicked stepmother - a far more interesting character - and to wait for Mr. Right,\\" that supports feminist theory,[22] but despite public feminist responses to the character, Disney regards Snow White as kind, sweet and respectful, encouraging children to, \\"be a friend to all,\\" in the same way she is depicted in the film.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nCinderella is the second Disney Princess.[18] Her movie, Disney's 12th animated feature film, is named after her, Cinderella,  released in 1950. She is often considered the \\"Leader of the Disney Princesses\\". Forced into servitude by her evil stepmother, Lady Tremaine, and her two cruel stepsisters, Drizella and Anastasia, after her father's death, her only source of happiness was her animal friends, which consists of birds and mice. While scrubbing the floors of her late father's mansion, an invitation to the Prince's ball is delivered, inviting all of the eligible women to attend so that he can find a wife. While Cinderella meets the requirements to attend, her stepfamily forbids her, going so far as to rip apart the clothes that the mice and birds had created for her as the carriage arrives. When all seems lost, her fairy godmother gives her the means to attend, where she falls in love with the Prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nCinderella is based on the heroine of the French fairy tale Cinderella by Charles Perrault and the German fairy tale Ashputtel by the Brothers Grimm. Originally voiced by Ilene Woods and animated by Marc Davis, in recent animated features she is currently voiced by Jennifer Hale. In the original movie, Cinderella's hair was intended to be more of a strawberry-blonde color, but today she is depicted as having blonde hair. Also, her iconic ball gown is depicted as light blue instead of silver in nearly all media and merchandise. Cinderella is also known as \\"Cinderelly\\" by the mice. These days, her legendary glass slipper, which was used by the Prince to find her, symbolizes Cinderella's timeless character and tale.\\r\\n\\r\\nCinderella was portrayed by Lily James in the 2015 live-action film. The film is commended for remaining close to the original plot line of the animated feature supplemented by added depth to give the original character more background and dimension. Reviews cite the movie's usage of  the mantra, \\"have courage and be kind\\" (\\"But at least [Cinderella's] outward beauty is poignantly augmented by an inner kindness and courage, things she manages to hold on to despite the abuses heaped upon her by her stepmother and stepsisters\\"),[24] claiming it to support and to help modern audiences reinvigorate their admiration of one of the earliest Disney princesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Snow White, Cinderella faces feminist criticism for chasing after a man for freedom, displaying household chores, and means of beauty as the only way to attract a man that viewers may see the need to perpetuate.[25] Disney, however, cites Cinderella as a persistent princess in the light of injustice, believing she sends the message to \\"never give up.\\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAurora, originally voiced by Mary Costa, is the third Disney Princess.[18] She first appeared in Disney's 16th animated feature film Sleeping Beauty (1959). The motion picture is adapted from the French fairy tale The Sleeping Beauty by Charles Perrault (1697), from the German fairy tale Little Briar Rose (1812) by The Brothers Grimm and from The Sleeping Beauty ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1890). Aurora is a princess by birth, daughter of her kingdom's rulers and betrothed to another kingdom's prince. She is described as having hair of sunshine gold and lips that shame the red rose; she is also often described as being kind, shy, sophisticated, and a hopeless romantic. At first, she is seen as a little naive and insecure as a result of being sheltered for most of her life but, unlike Snow White, she is somewhat pluckier and more opinionated. In later media, she is shown to have matured and become more self-assured, independent and confident. She was later voiced by Erin Torpey and Jennifer Hale, and is currently voiced by Kate Higgins.\\r\\n\\r\\nAurora was also portrayed by Elle Fanning in the film Maleficent, the film about the fairy's backstory of Maleficent, played by Angelina Jolie.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike her counterparts in the first wave of animated Disney films, Aurora is criticized for feminist depictions, mainly in the fact that she had very little involvement both in the fairy tale and in her own Disney movie, where Princess Aurora only appears for about 30 minutes. In many bloggers' opinions, \\"Aurora in the film is not a person, per se; she is the prize that the other characters fight over. She is an object, really, and that is not feminist at all,\\".[28] Disney, on their Disney princesses website, claims Aurora to inspire young girls to \\"always wonder.\\"[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nAriel is the fourth Disney Princess, as well as the title character in Disney's 28th animated feature film The Little Mermaid, released in 1989. She is the youngest of King Triton's seven daughters. Ariel is a mermaid princess in the undersea kingdom Atlantica (according to later media in the franchise). Fascinated by the human world and tired of life under the sea, Ariel makes a deal with Ursula, an evil sea witch, trading her voice for the chance to experience the human world. Based on the Danish fairy tale The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen, Ariel is voiced by Jodi Benson and animated by Glen Keane and Mark Henn. The character was inspired by the protagonist in Andersen's story but was developed into a different personality for the film.[30] Ariel is fiercely independent and a dreamer, which is notable in her collecting of human world treasures in her private grotto. She is bold and a risk-taker, distinguished by her bright red hair, purple/lavender seashell bra and green tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Little Mermaid was the first animated Disney Princess film following Sleeping Beauty from 1959.[31] As such, Ariel's film marks a new \\"Renaissance\\" of Disney that created more progressive, independent princesses with higher levels of depth and complexity.[32] However, of all of the progressive Princesses, Ariel is regarded as one of the least feminist ones depicted. She sings \\"Part of Your World\\" which pleads for a chance to explore her curiosity in the outside world, though critics cite that curiosity is largely driven by her desire to marry a man that she has never even spoken to. However, in direct contrast to this criticism, Ariel was depicted in the film as being interested in the human world and species and sang the song long before falling in love with Eric. Without her voice, many fear that she is reliant on her beauty and sexuality only and, in the end, is saved by her male lover, Prince Eric, only to spend the rest of her life on the human world.[33] Disney, however, claims Ariel spreads a message of, \\"explor[ing] new worlds,\\"[34] that many other viewers notice throughout the film.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nBelle is the fifth Disney Princess, first introduced in Disney's 30th animated feature film Beauty and the Beast (1991). Based on the heroine of the French fairy tale by Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont, Belle was created by screenwriter Linda Woolverton[36] and originally animated by James Baxter[37] and Mark Henn.[38]  Originally voiced by Paige O'Hara, Belle is currently voiced by Julie Nathanson. O'Hara will, however, return as the voice of Belle in the 2018 film Ralph Breaks the Internet.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrustrated with her provincial village life, book-loving Belle longs for adventure. When her father Maurice is imprisoned by a hideous beast, Belle sacrifices her own freedom in return for his. At first frightened by the Beast's physical appearance and repulsed by his selfishness, Belle learns to appreciate him after he rescues her from a pack of hungry wolves, expressing her gratitude by tending to his wounds. While the Beast's love for Belle gradually results in him adapting a more friendly and civil manner, Belle befriends him, eventually managing to fall in love with him by the time the last petal falls off an enchanted rose, which ultimately breaks a spell cast on him and transforms him back into a handsome prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma Watson portrays Belle in the live-action adaptation, which is also titled Beauty and the Beast. [40]\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonality-wise, Belle has been regarded as an independent,[41] intelligent,[42] courageous,[43] and headstrong[44] as well as a feminist.[45]  The character has been universally lauded by critics, garnering specific praise and recognition for her intelligence and bravery. The Los Angeles Times hailed Belle as one of the Disney Princesses responsible for \\"break[ing] the bonds of convention\\".[46] The Globe and Mail praised the character, complimenting her intellect and labeling her the \\"main attraction of Beauty and the Beast\\".[47] Entertainment Weekly highlighted the character's independence, calling her \\"the hero\\" of the film and accrediting her with making Beauty and the Beast the best Disney Princess film.[48] The Washington Post described Belle as \\"more mature, more womanly and less blandly asexual\\" than previous Disney heroines.[49]  The American Film Institute nominated Belle for its list of 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains.[50]  Belle remains the best-received Disney Princess to-date. Disney cites Belle as a role model for the mantra, \\"don't judge a book by its cover.\\"[4][51]\\r\\n\\r\\nJasmine is the sixth Disney Princess and the leading lady of Disney's 31st animated feature film Aladdin (1992). Jasmine is fierce, bold, and confident, rarely allowing anyone to tell her how to live her life. Jasmine hungers for independence, tired of the restrictions laid before her by her father. She falls in love with Aladdin while he is disguised as a prince after he takes her on a romantic ride on a magic carpet. Aladdin's genie companion is summoned by Jafar, who uses the genie's magic to tyrannically overthrow Jasmine's father, the Sultan. Luckily, after Jafar's defeat, the Sultan permits Jasmine to wed Aladdin despite his lack of royal heritage. Princess Jasmine is voiced by Linda Larkin, animated by Mark Henn, and her singing voice is provided by Lea Salonga (in the feature film) and Liz Callaway (in the direct-to-video sequel). Naomi Scott will star as Jasmine in a live-action film adaptation of Aladdin.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nJasmine is based on Princess Badroulbadour from the One Thousand and One Nights tale of \\"Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nJasmine is one of the first Disney princesses to identify as a minority and to be a part of a movie taking place in an area other than Europe. While a part of the new line of progressive princesses, shown by how Jasmine is more likely to leave the castle and has immense curiosity about the world beyond the palace walls, critics have judged her for her reliance on a man, sexuality that is displayed more than in the other princesses prior, and for her false representation of Middle Eastern culture. Her sexual depiction, particularly in a scene where she seduces the villain Jafar, as well as her Western features, makes critics fear the messages Disney is spreading about culture, as well as the continued image of women winning over men with their bodies: \\"Other than skin tone, this feature appears to be the only signifier of racial difference. In terms of the body. Jasmine, although still small-waisted is \\"filmed\\" in more active sequences and appears, through both the physical presence and activity in scenes, more athletic.\\"[33] Disney claims its intention with Jasmine is to inspire viewers to \\"see the good in others.\\"[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nPocahontas is the seventh Disney Princess and first appeared in Disney's 33rd animated feature film Pocahontas (1995). Based on the Native American chief's daughter, Pocahontas (c. 1595ÿ1617), and the settlement of Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. Pocahontas is displayed as a noble, independent and highly spiritual young woman. She expresses wisdom beyond her years and offers kindness and guidance to those around her. An adventurer and nature lover, in the film she appears to have shamanic powers since she was able to communicate with nature, spirits, and animals and understand foreign languages. In the sequel, Pocahontas, after hearing of John Smith's assumed death, is heartbroken. Despite this, she keeps her independent spirit and playfulness and is even much more mature and self-assured than she was in the first film. During her stay in England, she nearly loses herself in the hustle and bustle of the new world, consequently falling victim to western culture assimilation. But in the end, she bravely intends to sacrifice herself for her people's safety and returns to her homeland, finding herself, and love, once again. She was voiced by Irene Bedard and animated by Glen Keane while her singing was provided by Judy Kuhn.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Jasmine, Pocahontas, and her film, are criticized for the depiction of over-sexualized females in a culturally diverse world. Both princesses are shown with small waists, large almond eyes, and incredibly athletic ability that none of the Caucasian Disney princesses represent. Further, the film has been met with criticism from the Native American community as heralding colonialism and an invalid, romanticized representation of an important figure to the Powhatan people. In terms of its '90s debut, Buescher and Ono in their critical review of the film claim that Pocahontas's actions, \\"appropriates contemporary social issues of feminism, environmentalism, and human freedom in order to make racial domination appear innocent and pure.\\"[54] Despite these issues, Pocahontas is the first Disney Princess to not continue her romantic relationship at the conclusion of the film and even plays a direct role in rescuing her lover, John Smith. She is considered to be one of the most independent Disney princesses.[55] Disney claims Pocahontas as a role model to \\"respect the earth.\\"[4] Pocahontas is the first Disney Princess based on a real person.\\r\\n\\r\\nFa Mulan, or simply Mulan is the eighth Disney Princess[56] and first appeared in Disney's 36th animated feature film Mulan (1998). The movie is adapted from the legend of Hua Mulan (6th century; 'Northern and Southern Dynasties' period).  Mulan, atypical and unlike most previous female roles, is courageous and more self-reliant. She also does not fit in with the expectations of a young Chinese girl of the time; despite her natural beauty, she is clumsy, outspoken, and independent rather than graceful, silent and demure. After her meeting with the matchmaker ended in chaos, the matchmaker claimed that even though she had the looks of a bride, she would never find a match. However, her courage, intelligence, and determination helped her through her adventures, in which she disguises herself as a male soldier in order to fight in the Chinese army in place of her wounded father. She was voiced by Ming-Na Wen and animated by Mark Henn while her singing was provided by Lea Salonga. Liu Yifei is set to portray Mulan in a live-action adaptation of the 1998 animated film.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan saves her people and is the hero of her own story. Because of this, many see Mulan as a positive role model in her determination, risk-taking, and her conclusion of saving all of China.[55] Disney promotes Mulan as role model who can help \\"find your inner warrior.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nTiana, voiced by Anika Noni Rose and animated by Mark Henn, is the ninth Disney Princess character to be incorporated into the franchise, appearing in Disney's 49th animated feature film The Princess and the Frog (2009). Her film is loosely based on the novel The Frog Princess by E. D. Baker, which is in turn based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale The Frog Prince. Tiana is portrayed as being a hardworking, ambitious, and beautiful young woman who has no love interest (at the start of the film). Living in New Orleans, Louisiana, Tiana strives to achieve her goal of opening her own restaurant (an ambition inspired by the accomplishments of real-life restaurateur Leah Chase).[58] However, she is transformed into a frog after trying to break a spell cast by a Bokor on Prince Naveen that had changed him into a frog also. Throughout the film, the pair must embark on a quest to find a way to break the spell. Tiana was officially \\"coronated\\" and became a member of the Disney Princess line-up on March 14, 2010, at the New York Palace Hotel in Manhattan, New York.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nTiana marks the first princess in the \\"fourth-wave\\" feminist movement that initiated the most modern line of Disney films, including movies like Tangled, Brave and Frozen. Unlike her past counterparts, Tiana has received more praise than criticism for her depiction of female independence and of minority culture. Christopher Lehman, author of \\"The Colored Cartoon,\\" claims that, \\"Princess and the Frog\\" [i]s a step in the right direction because it deviates from those polarized caricatures with characters that are crafted with individuality,\\" those characters being either \\"mammy\\" or over sexualized versions of female African Americans. Instead, Tiana offers a new perspective as simply a hard-working woman who bears no reliance on a man.[59] Disney says Tiana represents \\"mak[ing] a dream real.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nRapunzel is the tenth Disney Princess. First appearing in Disney's 50th animated feature film Tangled (2010), Rapunzel is based on the heroine of the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. Created by screenwriter Dan Fogelman, Rapunzel was originally animated by Glen Keane and is voiced by recording artist and actress Mandy Moore. The character was \\"coronated\\" and inducted into the Disney Princess franchise on October 2, 2011, at Kensington Palace in London, England.[13][60][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nA princess born with long, magical golden hair, Rapunzel, stolen from her parents, the King and Queen of Corona, at infancy, is raised by Mother Gothel, an evil and vain old woman and exploits her hair to remain young and beautiful. Incarcerated in an isolated tower for eighteen years, Rapunzel enlists the help of a wanted thief named Flynn Rider to see the floating lanterns in time for her 18th birthday.\\r\\n\\r\\nRapunzel is the first Disney Princess to debut in a CGI film but is frequently revamped to a traditionally animated design.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character has been generally well received by most critics. Particular praise was awarded to her spirited personality and contemporaneity. The Los Angeles Times described Rapunzel as \\"a very modern young woman\\".[62] The New Yorker called Rapunzel a witty and intelligent character,[63] while USA Today wrote, \\"Rapunzel is more believable in her teenage histrionics\\" than previous Disney heroines.[64]  However, some reviews, such as the two provided by Time Out, were less favorable in their opinions of the character, describing her as both a \\"bland\\"[65] and \\"synthetic\\" character.[66] Disney describes her as promoting \\"jump[ing] into new adventures.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nMerida is the eleventh Disney princess, first appearing in the Pixar film Brave (2012).[3]  Voiced by Kelly Macdonald, the character's singing voice is provided by Julie Fowlis. She was created by director and screenwriter Brenda Chapman. Merida is the 16-year-old daughter of Queen Elinor, who rules the kingdom alongside King Fergus. Queen Elinor's expectations of her daughter make Merida see her mother as being distant while also causing friction between the two. Despite Elinor's desire to see Merida as a proper royal lady, Merida is an impetuous girl who wants to take control of her own destiny. She has honed her skill in archery and is one of the most skilled archers ever seen. She is also skilled in sword-fighting and cross-country horse riding on her horse, Angus. Merida was \\"coronated\\" and officially became a part of the Disney Princess franchise on May 11, 2013, at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe is the first Disney princess in the line-up to not have a love interest in her film, and the first to not sing in her film, as well as the first Pixar character to be included. Further, her stubbornness and independence have generally resonated with feminists, as well as her near entire rejection of \\"princess duties\\" like marrying a man and looking proper.[68] Merida's redesign to fit in with the Disney Princess franchise, however, was criticised by Brenda Chapman, Merida's creator, as being sexualised.[69]  She is also the first Pixar and the second CGI princess. By her actions throughout the film, Disney makes Merida the spokesperson of bravery.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAriel has an attraction at the California Adventure park called \\"Ariel's Undersea Adventure\\" which opened June 3, 2011.[70]  Guests in Paradise Pier hop in the \\"clam-mobile\\" and are taken under the sea into Ariel's world.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow White has her own ride at Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland and Disneyland Paris known as \\"Snow White's Scary Adventures\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Snow White's Scary Adventures\\" ride was also featured at the Walt Disney World Resort, however, it was removed in 2012 as part of the New Fantasyland expansion.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn attraction opened in the Magic Kingdom's New Fantasyland entitled \\"Enchanted Tales with Belle\\" on December 6, 2012.[73]  The 20-minute attraction takes guests into Maurice's cottage to meet Belle and reenact the story of the Beauty and the Beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Sea: Journey of the Little Mermaid, which is based on Disneyland's The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure, opened on December 6, 2012.[74] The Magic Kingdom attraction has a different exterior and queue than the one in Disneyland.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 28, 2014, the \\"Seven Dwarfs Mine Train\\" opened in Magic Kingdom at the Walt Disney World Resort.[75]  The 2,000-foot long steel roller coaster averages a speed of 34?mph and features two drops peaking at 41 feet.  \\"Just like in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, make your merry way across the rolling stone bridges and through a forest where youll find the Dwarfs cottage and all the stars from the film.\\"[76] Riders are brought through the story in a runaway mine train alongside the Dwarfs through the forest, by the cottage, and into the diamond mine of the Dwarfs.  The mine cave features what Disney Imagineers say are \\"some of the most advanced Audio-Animatronics characters ever created.\\"[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, all the princesses are available for meet-and-greets in Disneyland Resort in California. Additionally, In 2006, as part of the \\"Year of Million Dreams\\" celebration, the Fantasyland Theater began hosting the Disneyland Princess Fantasy Faire, a show featuring Lords and Ladies that taught young boys and girls the proper etiquette to be a prince or princess and features appearances from the Disney Princesses. In 2010, Rapunzel was given a Tangled meet-and-greet location. The Carnation Plaza Gardens bandstand, adjacent to Sleeping Beauty Castle, was closed to be replaced by a new Fantasy Faire area in the Spring of 2013.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fantasy Faire area in Disneyland officially opened on March 12, 2013, as the permanent home for the Disney Princesses and consists of a Royal Hall, a Royal Theatre, Maurice's Treats food cart and Fairytale Treasures gift shop.[79][80] The theater features two small shows based on Beauty and the Beast and Tangled. The hall is used for meet and greets with the princesses, which have a rotation schedule with three princesses scheduled to appear at a time.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Walt Disney World Resort, the princesses are available for meet-and-greets in more specific locations. Cinderella-based character dining and interaction, located at Cinderella's Royal Table in her Magic Kingdom castle, as well as \\"Cinderella's Happily Ever After Dinner,\\" (formerly known as the Cinderella's Gala Feast Dinner) at 1900 Park Fare in the Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa are common places for Cinderella and other Disney characters to appear. The Princesses also can be found at the Princess Storybook meal at Epcot. On September 18, 2013, a new meet-and-greet attraction called Princess Fairytale Hall opened at the Magic Kingdom.[79][81][82]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany shows and parades across the property feature the princesses, including Fantasmic, Main Street Electrical Parade, Dream Along with Mickey, the Festival of Fantasy Parade, Mickey's Boo-to-You Halloween Parade and Mickey's Once Upon a Christmastime Parade. A store named \\"Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique\\" opened April 5, 2006, at the World of Disney store in Downtown Disney (now Disney Springs) at Walt Disney World; this shop allows children to receive princess makeovers. A second location opened in Cinderella Castle on September 10, 2007. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 22, 2007, the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World Resort began its first Pirate and Princess Party. This hard ticketed event featured \\"Disney's Enchanted Adventures Parade\\" and a specially themed fireworks spectacular called \\"Magic, Music and Mayhem\\". The parade featured the six main Princesses attended by knights and dancers. Each land is themed accordingly to a pirate or princess, such as Jasmine's Court in Adventureland, Ariel's Court in Fantasyland and the Princess Pavilion in Mickey's Toontown Fair. This event has since been discontinued.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Princess meet and greet location called Once Upon a Time was operational at Shanghai Disneyland's opening and is located at Storybook Castle.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Disney Princesses' television appearances were compiled into the Disney Princess Collection, a series of compilation DVDs containing episodes from Aladdin, The Little Mermaid and two Beauty and the Beast specials. A later DVD series was released, entitled Disney Princess Stories, featuring content similar to the previous release. Princess Party Palace (formerly known as The Princess Power Hour) was a programming block on Toon Disney from 2000 until 2007 and where it used to air episodes of The Little Mermaid and Aladdin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelle had her own live-action television series called Sing Me a Story with Belle. The first eight Disney Princesses also made appearances on the animated TV series House of Mouse and Belle also made an appearance (along with her husband, Beast) on a short episode from the  TV animated series Mickey Mouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2007, Disney announced Disney Princess Enchanted Tales, a new series of direct-to-video features that feature new stories for the Disney Princesses. The first movie in the series entitled Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams, was released on September 4, 2007. It is a musical film featuring new tales about Princess Jasmine and the first new tale about Princess Aurora since the original Sleeping Beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: A Kingdom of Kindness was announced as the first film in the series, which contained a different Princess Aurora story, and had a Belle story rather than a Princess Jasmine story. Disney made this change without any sort of notice.[citation needed] Currently,[when?] the series is cancelled and only \\"Follow Your Dreams\\" exists.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe TV series Once Upon a Time that airs on the Disney-owned ABC, featured live-action versions of Snow White, Cinderella, Belle, Aurora, Mulan, Ariel, Rapunzel, Merida, Jasmine and Tiana in addition to Anna and Elsa. Snow White and Belle were main characters while the rest made recurring and or guest appearances. Beginning in season 7, Cinderella, Tiana and Rapunzel were main characters. Many of these characters are patterned after the Disney versions, but a few draw inspiration from older stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe TV series Sofia the First premiered on January 11, 2013, on Disney Junior; to date,[when?] Cinderella appeared in the first movie Once Upon A Princess. Jasmine, Belle, Aurora, Snow White, Mulan, Tiana, and Merida have appeared on the show, and Ariel and Rapunzel appeared in the TV Specials The Floating Palace and The Curse of Princess Ivy, respectively. There are plans to feature Pocahontas and Moana in future episodes. However, Sofia is a minor princess and not in the royal court. She is voiced by Modern Family star Ariel Winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2014 film Maleficent, Aurora is played by Elle Fanning. Lily James portrays Cinderella in the 2015 film of the same name. Emma Watson is seen as Belle in the 2017 film Beauty and the Beast. Naomi Scott is set to star as Jasmine in the 2019 film Aladdin.[84] Liu Yifei will appear as Mulan in the 2020 film of the same name.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Princesses, along with Anna, Elsa and Moana, will all make guest appearances in Ralph Breaks the Internet. This will mark the first time the princesses would be interacting with each other in a feature film on-screen.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Kilala Princess, a Japanese fantasy/romance manga produced by Kodansha that debuted in Nakayoshi in April 2005. The plot of the manga revolves around a girl named Kilala and her adventures to find her kidnapped friend with the help of the first six Disney Princesses, who are Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora, Ariel, Belle, and Jasmine, though Kilala herself isn't considered part of the franchise.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney Princesses have appeared in various other media, such as video games, including Disney Princess: Enchanted Journey, Disney Princess: Magical Jewels, and Disney Princess: My Fairytale Adventure.[87] Rapunzel can be found as a character in the 2013 game Disney Infinity along with other non-franchise princesses. Anna and Elsa are also included but are not officially part of the Disney Princess Royal Court. Disney Infinity: 2.0 Edition has the addition of Merida and Jasmine. However, Merida is also included with Stitch in the Toy Box Starter Pack. Disney Infinity 3.0 includes the character Mulan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Kingdom Hearts game series, the seven \\"Princesses of Heart\\", are young ladies with entirely pure hearts who would open the way to Kingdom Hearts if gathered together. Five of these maidens- Cinderella, Belle, Aurora, Snow White and Jasmine are Disney Princesses. The remaining Princesses of Heart are Alice from Alice in Wonderland and game series' heroine, Kairi, though the latter is only exclusive to the video game like Kilala. The Disney Princesses make various appearances throughout the series:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Disney Princess franchise has received mixed reception from critics and parents, particularity feminists.\\r\\n\\r\\nPocahontas was criticized by University of Puget Sound Communications Professor Derek Buescher and University of Utah Professor of Communication Kent Ono. In their paper Civilized Colonialism: Pocahontas as a Neocolonial Rhetoric,  they call the film as an attempt to justify and purify colonization which implies that all Native American people are \\"savages\\" that are in need of white assimilation.[54] Reception to Disney's first African-American princess, Tiana, the star of The Princess and the Frog, was mostly positive, and considered \\"a step in the right direction.\\" However, the film's New Orleans setting in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and references to voodoo drew criticism from parents and the media, as did Tiana's romance with a \\"Caucasian\\" prince.[89] Tiana's love interest, Prince Naveen, has brown skin[90] and has been interpreted as a non-white character.[91] According to a Disney executive, Naveen's \\"background was made up; he's whatever ethnicity they have in [Naveen's] fictional [homeland of] Maldonia.\\"[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney's attitudes mirrored the cultural beliefs of the 1940s about what roles women should play in society.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 24, 2006, Peggy Orenstein published \\"What's Wrong With Cinderella?\\" in The New York Times. In her article, Orenstein discussed her concerns about the effects of princess figures on young girls. Orenstein used the Disney Princesses specifically to present many of her points. Orenstein also noted the pervasive nature of Princess merchandise and that every facet of play has its princess equivalent.[7]  Tamara Weston of Time magazine criticized the franchise, referring to the princesses as \\"damsels in distress\\" and negative role models for young girls.[93] Anna Smith of The Guardian disliked that Disney princesses were typically drawn with slender figures and large eyes.[94] Other sources have also voiced concern that the franchise could possibly give young girls the wrong message.[95] However, other parents who have young daughters say that they would eventually grow out of this phase.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany articles describe Disney Princesses as the beginnings of feminism. In the Bustle article \\"A Feminist Ranking Of All The Disney Princesses, Because Not Every Princess Was Down For Waiting For Anyone To Rescue Her,\\" Chelsea Maze ranks Disney Princesses and how each one contributes to feminism in her own way. The first princess is Mulan and the last one is Aurora. These ranks connect to how they contribute to the man's needs and also the main story plot in the films.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother recent article from Cracked.com explains how the Disney Princesses have always been feminist and has a deeper explanation as to how they are feminist. Kristi Harrison explains in her article \\"4 Ways Disney Princesses Created Modern Feminism\\". She explains how we should think of the princesses as protagonists instead of princesses. Most of their adventures began with rebellion against the patriarchy.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother article from Highbrow Magazine titled \\"How Fourth-Wave Feminism is Changing Disney Princesses\\" explains how the connection of feminism and Disney Princesses and the waves of feminism shape the way film and TV illustrate women. The first wave of feminism took place during the time the first three Disney princess films were produced. As said in the article, for these original Disney princesses, their beauty is their most defining characteristic. In all three films, the prince falls in love with and saves/marries the princess based solely on her appearance. These princesses are beautiful women and suffer because of circumstances out of their control and finally find salvation in the love of a powerful man.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nKaitlin Eberson, the author of the article, explains how the second waved of feminism that lasted until the 1980s went hand in hand with the civil rights movement and focused on womens legal and social equality. During this time Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, Pocahontas, and Mulan illustrated the ideology of societys drastically altered beliefs about who women are and how they should act, as each princess has a distinct personality.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earlier Disney princess films were criticized for their representation of domestication, romance, and dependence on a male hero. The next wave of Disney princess films, part of the so-called 'Progressive' Disney of the studio's renaissance era of animation, attempted to make more independent female characters, though romance still played a large role in all of these films. There was a long-time gap between the releases of Mulan and The Princess and the Frog, but the fourth wave of feminism discusses the issues faced by women and how women acknowledged the inequality between genders. During this wave, the films showed strong, independent women that were powerful and were not submissive to a patriarchal society.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nA. O. Scott of The New York Times in 2016 described the \\"feisty\\" and \\"battle-ready\\" Princess Leia as \\"a foremother of Hermione Granger and Katniss Everdeen and of countless latter-day Disney princesses\\".[100] Studies evaluating the prevalence of classic male and female qualities represented by varying characters in Disney animated films showed that the earlier films tended to have more of the female characters displaying feminine characteristics at 86%, while the middle films were more along the lines of 58%. The Princess and the Frog alone had 53% of feminine qualities featured in its films in comparison to male characteristics, showing the progression that Disney has undergone in terms of feminism and escaping gendered norms.[31] There is little data on the most recent films; however, general viewer reception has been positive in regards to the \\"feminist\\" qualities that these princesses display.[101]","input":"What was the very first disney princess movie?"},{"output":"isopropyl alcohol","context":"Rubbing alcohol refers to either isopropyl alcohol (propan-2-ol) or ethanol based liquids,[1] or the comparable British Pharmacopoeia defined surgical spirit, with isopropyl alcohol products being the most widely available.

The original rubbing alcohol was literally used as a liniment for massage; hence the name. This original rubbing alcohol was rather different from today's precisely formulated surgical spirit; in some formulations it was perfumed and included different additives, notably a higher concentration of methyl salicylate.\\r\\nThe name \\"rubbing\\" also emphasized that the alcohol was not intended for consumption, a significant distinction in Prohibition-era America; nonetheless it had become a well-documented surrogate alcohol as early as 1925.\\r\\nAll rubbing alcohols are volatile and flammable.

There have been a few significant breakthroughs in terms of use, but the same organizational metaphors and interaction idioms are still in use.

So, the design was based on the childlike primitives of eye-hand coordination, rather than use of command languages, user-defined macro procedures, or automated transformations of data as later used by adult professionals.\\r\\nEngelbart's work directly led to the advances at Xerox PARC. Several people went from SRI to Xerox PARC in the early 1970s. In 1973, Xerox PARC developed the Alto personal computer. It had a bitmapped screen, and was the first computer to demonstrate the desktop metaphor and graphical user interface (GUI). It was not a commercial product, but several thousand units were built and were heavily used at PARC, as well as other XEROX offices, and at several universities for many years. The Alto greatly influenced the design of personal computers during the late 1970s and early 1980s, notably the Three Rivers PERQ, the Apple Lisa and Macintosh, and the first Sun workstations.\\r\\nThe GUI was first developed at Xerox PARC by Alan Kay, Larry Tesler, Dan Ingalls, David Smith, Clarence Ellis and a number of other researchers. It used windows, icons, and menus (including the first fixed drop-down menu) to support commands such as opening files, deleting files, moving files, etc. In 1974, work began at PARC on Gypsy, the first bitmap What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) cut & paste editor. In 1975, Xerox engineers demonstrated a Graphical User Interface \\"including icons and the first use of pop-up menus\\".[3]\\r\\nIn 1981 Xerox introduced a pioneering product, Star, a workstation incorporating many of PARC's innovations. Although not commercially successful, Star greatly influenced future developments, for example at Apple, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems.[4]\\r\\nThe Xerox Alto (and later Xerox Star) was an early personal computer developed at Xerox PARC in 1973. It was the first computer to use the desktop metaphor and mouse-driven graphical user interface (GUI).\\r\\nThe Alto, unlike Star, was not a commercial product, but several thousand units were built and were heavily used at PARC, other Xerox facilities, at least one government facility and at several universities for many years. The Alto greatly influenced the design of some personal computers in the following decades, notably the Apple Macintosh and the first Sun workstations.\\r\\nThe Blit, a graphics terminal, was developed at Bell Labs in 1982.\\r\\nBeginning in 1979, started by Steve Jobs and led by Jef Raskin, the Apple Lisa and Macintosh teams at Apple Computer (which included former members of the Xerox PARC group) continued to develop such ideas. The Lisa, released in 1983, featured a high-resolution stationery-based (document-centric) graphical interface atop an advanced hard disk based OS that featured such things as preemptive multitasking and graphically oriented inter-process communication. The comparatively simplified Macintosh, released in 1984 and designed to be lower in cost, was the first commercially successful product to use a multi-panel window interface. A desktop metaphor was used, in which files looked like pieces of paper. File directories looked like file folders. There were a set of desk accessories like a calculator, notepad, and alarm clock that the user could place around the screen as desired; and the user could delete files and folders by dragging them to a trash-can icon on the screen. The Macintosh, in contrast to the Lisa, used a program-centric rather than document-centric design. Apple revisited the document-centric design, in a limited manner, much later with OpenDoc.\\r\\nThere is still some controversy over the amount of influence that Xerox's PARC work, as opposed to previous academic research, had on the GUIs of the Apple Lisa and Macintosh, but it is clear that the influence was extensive, because first versions of Lisa GUIs even lacked icons.[5][6] These prototype GUIs are at least mouse-driven, but completely ignored the WIMP ( \\"window, icon, menu, pointing device\\") concept. Screenshots of first GUIs of Apple Lisa prototypes show the early designs. Note also that Apple engineers visited the PARC facilities (Apple secured the rights for the visit by compensating Xerox with a pre-IPO purchase of Apple stock) and a number of PARC employees subsequently moved to Apple to work on the Lisa and Macintosh GUI. However, the Apple work extended PARC's considerably, adding manipulatable icons, and drag and drop manipulation of objects in the file system (see Macintosh Finder) for example. A list of the improvements made by Apple, beyond the PARC interface, can be read at Folklore.org.[7] Jef Raskin warns that many of the reported facts in the history of the PARC and Macintosh development are inaccurate, distorted or even fabricated, due to the lack of usage by historians of direct primary sources.[8]\\r\\nIn 1984, Apple released a television commercial which introduced the Apple Macintosh during the telecast of Super Bowl XVIII by CBS,[9] with allusions to George Orwell's noted novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four. The commercial was aimed at making people think about computers, identifying the user-friendly interface as a personal computer which departed from previous business-oriented systems,[10] and becoming a signature representation of Apple products.[11]\\r\\nIn 1986, the Apple IIgs was launched. The IIgs was a very advanced model of the successful Apple II series, based on 16-bit technology (in fact, virtually two machines into one). It came with a new operating system, the Apple GS/OS, which features a Finder-like GUI, very similar to that of the Macintosh series, able to deal with the advanced graphic abilities of its Video Graphics Chip (VGC).\\r\\nReleased in 1983, the Soviet Union Agat PC featured a graphical interface and a mouse device.\\r\\nFounded 1982, SGI introduced the IRIS 1000 Series[12] in 1983.[13] The first graphical terminals (IRIS 1000) shipped in late 1983, and the corresponding workstation model (IRIS 1400) was released in mid-1984. The machines used an early version of the MEX windowing system on top of the GL2 Release 1 operating environment.[14] Examples of the MEX user interface can be seen in a 1988 article in the journal \\"Computer Graphics\\",[15] while earlier screenshots can not be found. The first commercial GUI-based systems, these did not find widespread use as to their (discounted) academic list price of $22,500 and $35,700 for the IRIS 1000 and IRIS 1400, respectively.[13] However, these systems were commercially successful enough to start SGI's business as one of the main graphical workstation vendors. In later revisions of graphical workstations, SGI switched to the X window system, which had been developed starting at MIT since 1984 and which became the standard for UNIX workstations.\\r\\nDigital Research (DRI) created the Graphics Environment Manager (GEM) as an add-on program for personal computers. GEM was developed to work with existing CP/M and DOS operating systems on business computers such as IBM PC compatibles. It was developed from DRI software, known as GSX, designed by a former PARC employee. The similarity to the Macintosh desktop led to a copyright lawsuit from Apple Computer, and a settlement which involved some changes to GEM. This was to be the first of a series of 'look and feel' lawsuits related to GUI design in the 1980s.\\r\\nGEM received widespread use in the consumer market from 1985, when it was made the default user interface built into the Atari TOS operating system of the Atari ST line of personal computers. It was also bundled by other computer manufacturers and distributors, such as Amstrad. Later, it was distributed with the best-sold Digital Research version of DOS for IBM PC compatibles, the DR-DOS 6.0. The GEM desktop faded from the market with the withdrawal of the Atari ST line in 1992 and with the popularity of the Microsoft Windows 3.0 in the PC front around the same period of time. The Falcon030, released in 1993 was the last computer from Atari to use GEM.\\r\\nTandy's DeskMate appeared in the early 1980s on its TRS-80 machines and was ported to its Tandy 1000 range in 1984. Like most PC GUIs of the time, it depended on a disk operating system such as TRSDOS or MS-DOS. The application was popular at the time and included a number of programs like Draw, Text and Calendar, as well as attracting outside investment such as Lotus 1-2-3 for DeskMate.\\r\\nMSX-View was developed for MSX computers by ASCII Corporation and HAL Laboratory. MSX-View contains software such as Page Edit, Page View, Page Link, VShell, VTed, VPaint and VDraw. An external version of the built-in MSX View of the Panasonic FS-A1GT was released as an add-on for the Panasonic FS-A1ST on disk instead of 512?kB ROM DISK.\\r\\nThe Amiga computer was launched by Commodore in 1985 with a GUI called Workbench. Workbench was based on an internal engine developed mostly by RJ Mical, called Intuition, which drove all the input events. The first versions used a blue/orange/white/black default palette, which was selected for high contrast on televisions and composite monitors. Workbench presented directories as drawers to fit in with the \\"workbench\\" theme. Intuition was the widget and graphics library that made the GUI work. It was driven by user events through the mouse, keyboard, and other input devices.\\r\\nDue to a mistake made by the Commodore sales department, the first floppies of AmigaOS (released with the Amiga1000) named the whole OS \\"Workbench\\". Since then, users and CBM itself referred to \\"Workbench\\" as the nickname for the whole AmigaOS (including Amiga DOS, Extras, etc.). This common consent ended with release of version 2.0 of AmigaOS, which re-introduced proper names to the installation floppies of AmigaDOS, Workbench, Extras, etc.\\r\\nStarting with Workbench 1.0, AmigaOS treated the Workbench as a backdrop, borderless window sitting atop a blank screen. With the introduction of AmigaOS 2.0, however, the user was free to select whether the main Workbench window appeared as a normally layered window, complete with a border and scrollbars, through a menu item.\\r\\nAmiga users were able to boot their computer into a command-line interface (also known as the CLI or Amiga Shell). This was a keyboard-based environment without the Workbench GUI. Later they could invoke it with the CLI/SHELL command \\"LoadWB\\" which loaded Workbench GUI.\\r\\nOne major difference between other OS's of the time (and for some time after) was the Amiga's fully multi-tasking operating system, a powerful built-in animation system using a hardware blitter and copper and 4 channels of 26?kHz 8-bit sampled sound. This made the Amiga the first multi-media computer years before other OS's.\\r\\nLike most GUIs of the day, Amiga's Intuition followed Xerox's, and sometimes Apple's, lead. But a CLI was included which dramatically extended the functionality of the platform. However, the CLI/Shell of Amiga is not just a simple text-based interface like in MS-DOS, but another graphic process driven by Intuition, and with the same gadgets included in Amiga's graphics.library. The CLI/Shell interface integrates itself with the Workbench, sharing privileges with the GUI.\\r\\nThe Amiga Workbench evolved over the 1990s, even after Commodore's 1994 bankruptcy.\\r\\nAcorn's 8-bit BBC Master Compact shipped with Acorn's first public GUI interface in 1986.[16] Little commercial software, beyond that included on the Welcome disk, was ever made available for the system, despite the claim by Acorn at the time that \\"the major software houses have worked with Acorn to make over 100 titles available on compilation discs at launch\\".[17] The most avid supporter of the Master Compact appeared to be Superior Software, who produced and specifically labelled their games as 'Master Compact' compatible.\\r\\nRISC OS /r?sko???s/[18] is a series of graphical user interface-based computer operating systems (OSes) designed for ARM architecture systems. It takes its name from the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architecture supported. The OS was originally developed by Acorn Computers for use with their 1987 range of Archimedes personal computers using the Acorn RISC Machine processors. It comprises a command-line interface and desktop environment with a windowing system.\\r\\nOriginally branded as the Arthur 1.20 the subsequent Arthur 2 release was shipped under the name RISC OS 2.\\r\\nThe WIMP interface incorporates three mouse buttons (named Select, Menu and Adjust), context-sensitive menus, window order control (i.e. send to back) and dynamic window focus (a window can have input focus at any position on the stack). The Icon bar (Dock) holds icons which represent mounted disc drives, RAM discs, running applications, system utilities and docked: Files, Directories or inactive Applications. These icons have context-sensitive menus and support drag-and-drop behaviour. They represent the running application as a whole, irrespective of whether it has open windows.\\r\\nThe GUI is centred around the concept of files. The Filer displays the contents of a disc. Applications are run from the Filer view and files can be dragged to the Filer view from applications to perform saves. Application directories are used to store applications. The OS differentiates them from normal directories through the use of a pling (exclamation mark, also called shriek) prefix. Double-clicking on such a directory launches the application rather than opening the directory. The application's executable files and resources are contained within the directory, but normally they remain hidden from the user. Because applications are self-contained, this allows drag-and-drop installation and removal.\\r\\nThe RISC OS Style Guide encourages a consistent look and feel across applications. This was introduced in RISC OS 3 and specifies application appearance and behaviour. Acorn's own main bundled applications were not updated to comply with the guide until RISCOS Ltd's Select release in 2001.[19]\\r\\nThe outline fonts manager provides spatial anti-aliasing of fonts, the OS being the first operating system to include such a feature,[20][21][22][23] having included it since before January 1989.[24] Since 1994, in RISC OS 3.5, it has been possible to use an outline anti-aliased font in the WindowManager for UI elements, rather than the bitmap system font from previous versions.[25]\\r\\nBecause most of the very early IBM PC and compatibles lacked any common true graphical capability (they used the 80-column basic text mode compatible with the original MDA display adapter), a series of file managers arose, including Microsoft's DOS Shell, which features typical GUI elements as menus, push buttons, lists with scrollbars and mouse pointer. The name text-based user interface was later invented to name this kind of interface. Many MS-DOS text mode applications, like the default text editor for MS-DOS 5.0 (and related tools, like QBasic), also used the same philosophy. The IBM DOS Shell included with IBM DOS 5.0 (circa 1992) supported both text display modes and actual graphics display modes, making it both a TUI and a GUI, depending on the chosen mode.\\r\\nAdvanced file managers for MS-DOS were able to redefine character shapes with EGA and better display adapters, giving some basic low resolution icons and graphical interface elements, including an arrow (instead of a coloured cell block) for the mouse pointer. When the display adapter lacks the ability to change the character's shapes, they default to the CP437 character set found in the adapter's ROM. Some popular utility suites for MS-DOS, as Norton Utilities (pictured) and PC Tools used these techniques as well.\\r\\nDESQview was a text mode multitasking program introduced in July 1985. Running on top of MS-DOS, it allowed users to run multiple DOS programs concurrently in windows. It was the first program to bring multitasking and windowing capabilities to a DOS environment in which existing DOS programs could be used. DESQview was not a true GUI but offered certain components of one, such as resizable, overlapping windows and mouse pointing.\\r\\nBefore the MS-Windows age, and with the lack of a true common GUI under MS-DOS, most graphical applications which worked with EGA, VGA and better graphic cards had proprietary built-in GUIs. One of the best known such graphical applications was Deluxe Paint, a popular painting software with a typical WIMP interface.\\r\\nThe original Adobe Acrobat Reader executable file for MS-DOS was able to run on both the standard Windows 3.x GUI and the standard DOS command prompt. When it was launched from the command prompt, on a machine with a VGA graphics card, it provided its own GUI.\\r\\nWindows 1.0, a GUI for the MS-DOS operating system was released in 1985.[26] The market's response was less than stellar.[27] Windows 2.0 followed, but it wasn't until the 1990 launch of Windows 3.0, based on Common User Access that its popularity truly exploded. The GUI has seen minor redesigns since, mainly the networking enabled Windows 3.11 and its Win32s 32-bit patch. The 16-bit line of MS Windows were discontinued with the introduction of Windows 95 and Windows NT 32-bit based architecture in the 1990s. See the next section.\\r\\nThe main window of a given application can occupy the full screen in maximized status. The users must then to switch between maximized applications using the Alt+Tab keyboard shortcut; no alternative with the mouse except for de-maximize. When none of the running application windows are maximized, switching can be done by clicking on a partially visible window, as is the common way in other GUIs.\\r\\nIn 1988, Apple sued Microsoft for copyright infringement of the LISA and Apple Macintosh GUI. The court case lasted 4 years before almost all of Apple's claims were denied on a contractual technicality. Subsequent appeals by Apple were also denied. Microsoft and Apple apparently entered a final, private settlement of the matter in 1997.\\r\\nGEOS was launched in 1986. Originally written for the 8-bit home computer Commodore 64 and shortly after, the Apple II series. The name was later used by the company as PC/Geos for IBM PC systems, then Geoworks Ensemble. It came with several application programs like a calendar and word processor, and a cut-down version served as the basis for America Online's DOS client. Compared to the competing Windows 3.0 GUI it could run reasonably well on simpler hardware, but its developer had a restrictive policy towards third-party developers that prevented it from becoming a serious competitor. And it was targeted at 8-bit machines and the 16-bit computer age was dawning.\\r\\nThe standard windowing system in the Unix world is the X Window System (commonly X11 or X), first released in the mid-1980s. The W Window System (1983) was the precursor to X; X was developed at MIT as Project Athena. Its original purpose was to allow users of the newly emerging graphic terminals to access remote graphics workstations without regard to the workstation's operating system or the hardware. Due largely to the availability of the source code used to write X, it has become the standard layer for management of graphical and input/output devices and for the building of both local and remote graphical interfaces on virtually all Unix, Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, with the notable exceptions of macOS and Android.\\r\\nX allows a graphical terminal user to make use of remote resources on the network as if they were all located locally to the user by running a single module of software called the X server. The software running on the remote machine is called the client application. X's network transparency protocols allow the display and input portions of any application to be separated from the remainder of the application and 'served up' to any of a large number of remote users. X is available today as free software.\\r\\nThe PostScript-based NeWS (Network extensible Window System) was developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s. For several years SunOS included a window system combining NeWS and the X Window System. Although NeWS was considered technically elegant by some commentators, Sun eventually dropped the product. Unlike X, NeWS was always proprietary software.\\r\\nThe widespread adoption of the PC platform in homes and small businesses popularized computers among people with no formal training. This created a fast-growing market, opening an opportunity for commercial exploitation and of easy-to-use interfaces and making economically viable the incremental refinement of the existing GUIs for home systems.\\r\\nAlso, the spreading of Highcolor and True Color capabilities of display adapters providing thousands and millions of colors, along with faster CPUs and accelerated graphic cards, cheaper RAM, storage devices orders of magnitude larger (from megabytes to gigabytes) and larger bandwidth for telecom networking at lower cost helped to create an environment in which the common user was able to run complicated GUIs which began to favor aesthetics.\\r\\nAfter Windows 3.11, Microsoft began to develop a new consumer-oriented version of the operating system. Windows 95 was intended to integrate Microsoft's formerly separate MS-DOS and Windows products and included an enhanced version of DOS, often referred to as MS-DOS 7.0. It also featured a significant redesign of the GUI, dubbed \\"Cairo\\". While Cairo never really materialized, parts of Cairo found their way into subsequent versions of the operating system starting with Windows 95. Both Win95 and WinNT could run 32-bit applications, and could exploit the abilities of the Intel 80386 CPU, as the preemptive multitasking and up to 4?GiB of linear address memory space. Windows 95 was touted as a 32-bit based operating system but it was actually based on a hybrid kernel (VWIN32.VXD) with the 16-bit user interface (USER.EXE) and graphic device interface (GDI.EXE) of Windows for Workgroups (3.11), which had 16-bit kernel components with a 32-bit subsystem (USER32.DLL and GDI32.DLL) that allowed it to run native 16-bit applications as well as 32-bit applications. In the marketplace, Windows 95 was an unqualified success, promoting a general upgrade to 32-bit technology, and within a year or two of its release had become the most successful operating system ever produced.\\r\\nAccompanied by an extensive marketing campaign,[28] Windows 95 was a major success in the marketplace at launch and shortly became the most popular desktop operating system.[29]\\r\\nWindows 95 saw the beginning of the browser wars, when the World Wide Web began receiving a great deal of attention in popular culture and mass media. Microsoft at first did not see potential in the Web, and Windows 95 was shipped with Microsoft's own online service called The Microsoft Network, which was dial-up only and was used primarily for its own content, not internet access. As versions of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer were released at a rapid pace over the following few years, Microsoft used its desktop dominance to push its browser and shape the ecology of the web mainly as a monoculture.\\r\\nWindows 95 evolved through the years into Windows 98 and Windows ME. Windows ME was the last in the line of the Windows 3.x-based operating systems from Microsoft. Windows underwent a parallel 32-bit evolutionary path, where Windows NT 3.1 was released in 1993. Windows NT (for New Technology)[30] was a native 32-bit operating system with a new driver model, was unicode-based, and provided for true separation between applications. Windows NT also supported 16-bit applications in an NTVDM, but it did not support VxD based drivers. Windows 95 was supposed to be released before 1993 as the predecessor to Windows NT. The idea was to promote the development of 32-bit applications with backward compatibility ÿ leading the way for more successful NT release. After multiple delays, Windows 95 was released without unicode and used the VxD driver model. Windows NT 3.1 evolved to Windows NT 3.5, 3.51 and then 4.0 when it finally shared a similar interface with its Windows 9x desktop counterpart and included a Start button. The evolution continued with Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, then Windows 7. Windows XP and higher were also made available in 64-bit modes. Windows server products branched off with the introduction of Windows Server 2003 (available in 32-bit and 64-bit IA64 or x64), then Windows Server 2008 and then Windows Server 2008 R2. Windows 2000 and XP shared the same basic GUI although XP introduced Visual Styles. With Windows 98, the Active Desktop theme was introduced, allowing an HTML approach for the desktop, but this feature was coldly received by customers, who frequently disabled it. At the end, Windows Vista definitively discontinued it, but put a new SideBar on the desktop.\\r\\nThe Macintosh's GUI has been revised multiple times since 1984, with major updates including System 7 and Mac OS 8. It underwent its largest revision to date with the introduction of the \\"Aqua\\" interface in 2001's Mac OS X. It was a new operating system built primarily on technology from NeXTStep with UI elements of the original Mac OS grafted on. macOS uses a technology known as Quartz, for graphics rendering and drawing on-screen. Some interface features of macOS are inherited from NeXTStep (such as the Dock, the automatic wait cursor, or double-buffered windows giving a solid appearance and flicker-free window redraws), while others are inherited from the old Mac OS operating system (the single system-wide menu-bar). Mac OS X 10.3 introduced features to improve usability including Expos, which is designed to make finding open windows easier.\\r\\nWith Mac OS X 10.4, new features were added, including Dashboard (a virtual alternate desktop for mini specific-purpose applications) and a search tool called Spotlight, which provides users with an option for searching through files instead of browsing through folders.\\r\\nIn the early days of X Window development, Sun Microsystems and AT&T attempted to push for a GUI standard called OPEN LOOK in competition with Motif. OPEN LOOK was[citation needed] developed from scratch in conjunction with Xerox, while Motif was a collective effort that fell into place, with a look and feel patterned after Windows 3.11.[citation needed] Motif prevailed in the UNIX GUI battles and became the basis for the Common Desktop Environment (CDE). CDE was based on Visual User Environment (VUE), a proprietary desktop from Hewlett-Packard that in turn was based on the Motif look and feel.\\r\\nIn the late 1990s, there was significant growth in the Unix world, especially among the free software community. New graphical desktop movements grew up around Linux and similar operating systems, based on the X Window System. A new emphasis on providing an integrated and uniform interface to the user brought about new desktop environments, such as KDE Plasma 5, GNOME and Xfce which have supplanted CDE in popularity on both Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The Xfce, KDE and GNOME look and feel each tend to undergo more rapid change and less codification than the earlier OPEN LOOK and Motif environments.\\r\\nLater releases added improvements over the original Workbench, like support for high-color Workbench screens, context menus, and embossed 2D icons with pseudo-3D aspect. Some Amiga users preferred alternative interfaces to standard Workbench, such as Directory Opus Magellan.\\r\\nThe use of improved, third-party GUI engines became common amongst users who preferred more attractive interfaces ÿ such as Magic User Interface (MUI), and ReAction. These object-oriented graphic engines driven by user interface classes and methods were then standardized into the Amiga environment and changed Amiga Workbench to a complete and modern guided interface, with new standard gadgets, animated buttons, true 24-bit-color icons, increased use of wallpapers for screens and windows, alpha channel, transparencies and shadows as any modern GUI provides.\\r\\nModern derivatives of Workbench are Ambient for MorphOS, Scalos, Workbench for AmigaOS 4 and Wanderer for AROS. There is a brief article on Ambient and descriptions of MUI icons, menus and gadgets at aps.fr and images of Zune stay at main AROS site.\\r\\nUse of object oriented graphic engines dramatically changes the look and feel of a GUI to match actual styleguides.\\r\\nOriginally collaboratively developed by Microsoft and IBM to replace DOS, OS/2 version 1.0 (released in 1987) had no GUI at all. Version 1.1 (released 1988) included Presentation Manager (PM), an implementation of IBM Common User Access, which looked a lot like the later Windows 3.1 UI. After the split with Microsoft, IBM developed the Workplace Shell (WPS) for version 2.0 (released in 1992), a quite radical, object-oriented approach to GUIs. Microsoft later imitated much of this look in Windows 95[citation needed].\\r\\nThe NeXTSTEP user interface was used in the NeXT line of computers. NeXTSTEP's first major version was released in 1989. It used Display PostScript for its graphical underpinning. The NeXTSTEP interface's most significant feature was the Dock, carried with some modification into Mac OS X, and had other minor interface details that some found made it easier and more intuitive to use than previous GUIs. NeXTSTEP's GUI was the first to feature opaque dragging of windows in its user interface, on a comparatively weak machine by today's standards, ideally aided by high performance graphics hardware.\\r\\nBeOS was developed on custom AT&T Hobbit-based computers before switching to PowerPC hardware by a team led by former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gasse as an alternative to Mac OS. BeOS was later ported to Intel hardware. It used an object-oriented kernel written by Be, and did not use the X Window System, but a different GUI written from scratch. Much effort was spent by the developers to make it an efficient platform for multimedia applications. Be Inc. was acquired by PalmSource, Inc. (Palm Inc. at the time) in 2001. The BeOS GUI still lives in Haiku, an open source software reimplementation of the BeOS.\\r\\nIn 2007 with the iPhone[31] and later in 2010 with the introduction of the iPad,[32] Apple popularized the post-WIMP style of interaction for multi-touch screens, with those devices considered to be milestones in the development of mobile devices.[33][34]\\r\\nOther portable devices such as MP3 players and cell phones have been a burgeoning area of deployment for GUIs in recent years. Since the mid-2000s, a vast majority of portable devices have advanced to having high-screen resolutions and sizes. (The Galaxy Note 4's 2,560 G 1,440 pixel display is an example). Because of this, these devices have their own famed user interfaces and operating systems that have large homebrew communities dedicated to creating their own visual elements, such as icons, menus, wallpapers, and more. Post-WIMP interfaces are often used in these mobile devices, where the traditional pointing devices required by the desktop metaphor are not practical.\\r\\nAs high-powered graphics hardware draws considerable power and generates significant heat, many of the 3D effects developed between 2000 and 2010 are not practical on this class of device. This has led to the development of simpler interfaces making a design feature of two dimensionality such as exhibited by the Metro (Modern) UI first used in Windows 8 and the 2012 Gmail redesign.[citation needed][dubious ÿ discuss]\\r\\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the rapid development of GPUs led to a trend for the inclusion of 3D effects in window management. It is based in experimental research[citation needed] in User Interface Design trying to expand the expressive power of the existing toolkits in order to enhance the physical cues that allow for direct manipulation. New effects common to several projects are scale resizing and zooming, several windows transformations and animations (wobbly windows, smooth minimization to system tray...), composition of images (used for window drop shadows and transparency) and enhancing the global organization of open windows (zooming to virtual desktops, desktop cube, Expos, etc.) The proof-of-concept BumpTop desktop combines a physical representation of documents with tools for document classification possible only in the simulated environment, like instant reordering and automated grouping of related documents.\\r\\nThese effects are popularized thanks to the widespread use of 3D video cards (mainly due to gaming) which allow for complex visual processing with low CPU use, using the 3D acceleration in most modern graphics cards to render the application clients in a 3D scene. The application window is drawn off-screen in a pixel buffer, and the graphics card renders it into the 3D scene.\\r\\nThis can have the advantage of moving some of the window rendering to the GPU on the graphics card and thus reducing the load on the main CPU, but the facilities that allow this must be available on the graphics card to be able to take advantage of this.\\r\\nExamples of 3D user-interface software include XGL and Compiz from Novell, and AIGLX bundled with Red Hat Fedora. Quartz Extreme for macOS and Windows 7 and Vista's Aero interface use 3D rendering for shading and transparency effects as well as Expos and Windows Flip and Flip 3D, respectively. Windows Vista uses Direct3D to accomplish this, whereas the other interfaces use OpenGL.\\r\\nVirtual reality devices such as the Oculus Rift and Sony's PlayStation VR (formerly Project Morpheus)[35] aim to provide users with presence, a perception of full immersion into a virtual environment.","input":"Who invented the first mouse driven graphical user interface?"},{"output":"2013ÿ14","context":"The Spanish football champions are the winners of the primary football competition in Spain, La Liga.

Flights as long as 1,800?km (1,100 miles) have been recorded by birds in competitive pigeon racing.[3] Their average flying speed over moderate 640?km (400 miles)  distances is around 80?km/h (50 miles per hour) but speeds of up to 140?km/h (90 miles per hour) have been observed in top racers for short[clarification needed] distances.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of this skill, homing pigeons were used to carry messages as messenger pigeons. They are usually referred to as \\"pigeon post\\" if used in post service, or \\"war pigeon\\" during wars.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoming pigeons are often incorrectly categorized as carrier pigeons, a breed of fancy pigeons selectively-bred for its distinctively rounded hard wattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nMale and female pigeons (cocks and hens, respectively) can be differentiated by physical characteristics of the head, beak, height, and breast, though visual identification of sex by physical characteristics alone can be inaccurate. Males usually stand taller, and have larger beaks, crops, wattles,[4] and eye ceres (fleshy growth around the eyes), as well as round heads and thicker napes. Females, on the other hand, tend to be shorter with smaller beaks, wattles, and ceres, as well as flatter heads and fuller breasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nMale and female pigeons show different behaviours. The \\"coo\\" of males is louder and more insistent, especially when courting. Display behaviour also differs between the sexes. Most notably, a male often turns 360 degrees with an inflated crop and a loud \\"coo\\", to show interest in a female or to defend or discourage another pigeon from entering its territory (usually a nesting box), while females almost never turn full circle, but rather do a 270-degree back-and-forth rotational motion.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring breeding season, usually during the warmer months, a male pigeon will court the female by puffing out his chest, bobbing his head and strutting in circles around her, all the while cooing his affections. If she accepts, she will allow him onto her back in order to copulate. After mating, the male will build a nest out of gathered sticks in a suitable crevice, while the female watches and makes changes. Urban birds will gladly use a roof on a building. The female will usually lay two eggs. The first egg would be laid late in the evening, and the other egg forty hours after, which will hatch in 17 to 20 days, depending on the weather. Both parents aid in rearing the nestlings. Fledglings usually leave the nest around four to five weeks after hatching.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sport of flying homing pigeons was well-established as early as 3000 years ago.[5] They were used to proclaim the winner of the Olympics.[5][6]\\r\\nMessenger pigeons were used as early as 1150 in Baghdad[7] and also later by Genghis Khan. By 1167 a regular service between Baghdad and Syria had been established by Sultan Nour-Eddin.[8] In Damietta, by the mouth of the Nile, the Spanish traveller Pedro Tafur saw carrier pigeons for the first time, in 1436, though he imagined that the birds made round trips, out and back.[9] The Republic of Genoa equipped their system of watch towers in the Mediterranean Sea with pigeon posts. Tipu Sultan used homing pigeons. They returned to the Jamia Masjid mosque in Srirangapatna, which was his headquarters. The pigeon holes may be seen in the mosque's minarets to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1818, a great pigeon race called the Cannonball Run took place at Brussels.[5] In 1860, Paul Reuter, who later founded Reuters press agency, used a fleet of over 45 pigeons to deliver news and stock prices between Brussels and Aachen, the terminus of early telegraph lines. The outcome of the Battle of Waterloo was also first delivered by a pigeon to England.[10] During the Franco-Prussian War pigeons were used to carry mail between besieged Paris and the French unoccupied territory. In December 1870, it took ten hours for a pigeon carrying microfilms to fly from Perpignan to Bruxelles.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, pigeons carried messages only one way, to their home. They had to be transported manually before another flight. However, by placing their food at one location and their home at another location, pigeons have been trained to fly back and forth up to twice a day reliably, covering round-trip flights up to 160?km (100?mi).[12] Their reliability has lent itself to occasional use on mail routes, such as the Great Barrier Pigeongram Service established between the Auckland, New Zealand, suburb of Newton and Great Barrier Island in November 1897,[13] possibly the first regular air mail service in the world. The world's first 'airmail' stamps were issued for the Great Barrier Pigeon-Gram Service from 1898 to 1908.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nHoming pigeons were still employed in the 21st century by certain remote police departments in Odisha state in eastern India to provide emergency communication services following natural disasters. In March 2002, it was announced that India's Police Pigeon Service messenger system in Odisha was to be retired, due to the expanded use of the Internet.[15] The Taliban banned the keeping or use of homing pigeons in Afghanistan.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this day, pigeons are entered into competitions, with the winner receiving prize money at the end.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch has been performed with the intention of discovering how pigeons, after being transported, can find their way back from distant places they have never visited before. Most researchers believe that homing ability is based on a \\"map and compass\\" model, with the compass feature allowing birds to orient and the map feature allowing birds to determine their location relative to a goal site (home loft).[18] While the compass mechanism appears to rely on the sun, the map mechanism has been highly debated.[19] Some researchers believe that the map mechanism relies on the ability of birds to detect the Earth's magnetic field. Birds can detect a magnetic field to help them find their way home. Scientists[who?] have found that on top of a pigeon's beak large number of iron particles are found which remain aligned to north like a man-made compass, thus it acts as compass which helps pigeon in determining its home. A light-mediated mechanism that involves the eyes and is lateralized has been examined somewhat, but developments have implicated the trigeminal nerve in magnetoception.[20][21] Research by Floriano Papi (Italy, early 1970s) and more recent work, largely by Hans Wallraff, suggest that pigeons also orient themselves using the spatial distribution of atmospheric odors,[19] known as olfactory navigation. Near their home lofts, in areas they have previously visited, pigeons probably are guided by visual landmarks.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch by Jon Hagstrum of the US Geological Survey suggests that homing pigeons use low-frequency infrasound to navigate.[22] Sound waves as low 0.1?Hz have been observed to disrupt or redirect pigeon navigation. The pigeon ear, being far too small to interpret such a long wave, directs pigeons to fly in a circle when first taking air, in order to mentally map such long infrasound waves.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious experiments suggest that different breeds of homing pigeons rely on different cues to different extents. Charles Walcott at Cornell University was able to demonstrate that while pigeons from one loft were confused by a magnetic anomaly in the Earth it had no effect on birds from another loft 1.6?km (1 mile) away. Other experiments have shown that altering the perceived time of day with artificial lighting or using air conditioning to eliminate odors in the pigeons' home roost affected the pigeons' ability to return home.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome research also indicates that homing pigeons navigate by following roads and other man-made features, making 90-degree turns and following habitual routes, much the same way that humans navigate.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nGPS tracing studies also indicate that gravitational anomalies also play a role.\\r\\n[24]\\r\\n[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen used as carrier pigeons in pigeon post a message is written on thin light paper and rolled into a small tube attached to the bird's leg. Pigeons can only go back to one \\"mentally marked\\" point that they have identified as their home, so \\"pigeon mail\\" can only work when the sender is actually holding the receiver's pigeons. White homing pigeons are used in dove-releasing ceremonies at weddings, funerals, and some sporting events.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith training, pigeons can carry up to 75?g (2.5?oz) on their backs. The German apothecary Julius Neubronner used carrier pigeons to deliver urgent medication.[26] In 1977 a similar carrier pigeon service was set up for the transport of laboratory specimens between two English hospitals. Every morning a basket with pigeons was taken from Plymouth General Hospital to Devonport Hospital. The birds then delivered unbreakable vials back to Plymouth as needed.[27] The 30 carrier pigeons became unnecessary in 1983 because of the closure of one of the hospitals.[28] In the 1980s a similar system existed between two French hospitals located in Granville and Avranche.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nBirds were used extensively during World War I. One homing pigeon, Cher Ami, was awarded the French Croix de guerre for her heroic service in delivering 12 important messages, despite having been very badly injured.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, the Irish Paddy, the American G.I. Joe and the English Mary of Exeter all received the Dickin Medal. They were among 32 pigeons to receive this award, for their gallantry and bravery in saving human lives with their actions. Eighty-two homing pigeons were dropped into the Netherlands with the First Airborne Division Signals as part of Operation Market Garden in World War II. The pigeons' loft was located in London, which would have required them to fly 390?km (240 miles) to deliver their messages.[31] Also in World War II, hundreds of homing pigeons with the Confidential Pigeon Service were airdropped into northwest Europe to serve as intelligence vectors for local resistance agents. Birds played a vital part in the Invasion of Normandy as radios could not be used for fear of vital information being intercepted by the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe humorous IP over Avian Carriers (RFC 1149) is an Internet protocol for the transmission of messages via homing pigeon. Originally intended as an April Fools' Day RFC entry, this protocol was implemented and used, once, to transmit a message in Bergen, Norway, on April 28, 2001.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2009, a South African IT company based in Durban pitted an 11-month-old bird armed with a data packed 4?GB memory stick against the ADSL service from the country's biggest Internet service provider, Telkom. The pigeon, Winston, took an hour and eight minutes to carry the data 80?km (50 miles). In all, the data transfer took two hours, six minutes, and fifty-seven secondsthe same amount of time it took to transfer 4% of the data over the ADSL.[33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nHoming pigeons have been reported to be used as a smuggling technique, getting objects and narcotics across borders and into prisons.[35] For instance, between 2009 and 2015, pigeons have been reported to carry cell phones, SIM cards, phone batteries and USB cords into prisons in the Brazilian state of S?o Paulo.[36][37]","input":"When were pigeons first used to carry messages?"},{"output":"Manhattan, New York","context":"The School of Visual Arts (SVA) is a for-profit art and design college located in Manhattan, New York, founded in 1947.

St. Petersburg is governed by a mayor and city council.[15]\\r\\nWith an average of some 361 days of sunshine each year, and a Guinness World Record for logging the most consecutive days of sunshine (768 days),[16][17] it is nicknamed \\"The Sunshine City\\".[16] Due to its good weather and low cost of living, the city has long been a popular retirement destination, although in recent years the population has moved in a much more youthful direction.[18] American Style magazine ranked St. Petersburg its top mid-size city in 2011, citing its \\"vibrant\\" arts scene.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city was co-founded by John C. Williams, formerly of Detroit, who purchased the land in 1875, and by Peter Demens who was instrumental in bringing the terminus of the Orange Belt Railway there in 1888.[11] The first major newspaper to debut in Tampa Bay was the St. Petersburg Times which established in 1884.[20] St. Petersburg was incorporated as a town on February 29, 1892, when it had a population of only some 300 people.[14][21]\\r\\nA local legend says that John C. Williams and Peter Demens flipped a coin to see who would have the honor of naming the city.[13][22] When Demens won the coin toss the city was named after Saint Petersburg, Russia, where Peter Demens had spent half of his youth,[23] while John C. Williams named the first hotel after his birthplace, Detroit (a hotel built by Demens).[11][24] The Detroit Hotel still exists downtown, but has been turned into a condominium.[25] The oldest running hotels are the historic Pier Hotel, built in 1921, formally Hotel Cordova and The Heritage Hotel (now named Hotel Indigo), built in 1926.[26]\\r\\nPhiladelphia publisher F. A. Davis turned on St. Petersburg's first electrical service in 1897 and its first trolley service in 1904.[27] The city's first major industry was born in 1899 when Henry W. Hibbs (1862ÿ1942), a native of Newport, North Carolina, established his wholesale fish business at the end of the railroad pier, which extended out to the shipping channel. Within a year, Hibbs Fish Company was shipping more than 1,000 pounds (450?kg) of fish each day.[28]\\r\\nSt. Petersburg was incorporated into a city in June 1903.[11] With this transition, the development of the downtown waterfront had dredging of a deeper shipping channel from 1906 to 1908 which opened St. Petersburg to larger shipping. Further dredging improved the port facilities through the 1910s.[29] By then the city's population had quadrupled to a population of 4,127 citizens.[30]\\r\\nIn 1914, the Tampa Bay area was one of the first Floridian cities that fell in love with baseball tracing its roots from Tampa and St. Petersburg. The former mayor of St. Petersburg, Al Lang, had invited the St. Louis Browns to move their spring training into the city.[31] Taking place in the same year, the airplane service across Tampa Bay from St. Petersburg to Tampa and back was initiated, generally considered the first scheduled commercial airline flight. The company name was the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, and the pilot was Tony Jannus, flying a Benoist XIV flying boat.[32] The Tony Jannus Award is presented annually for outstanding achievement in the airline industry.[33] Jannus Live, a local music/entertainment venue on Central Avenue in downtown, is also named after him.[34] Soon after, St. Petersburg's first library opened on December 1, 1915 which still operates till this day as the Mirror Lake Library.[11][35]\\r\\nThe 1920s in St. Petersburg was big due to its major growth brought by tourists. Tourists came from all over by automobile, yacht, and railroad. Travel time from across the bay was cut due to the Gandy Bridge's opening in 1924, helping St. Petersburg increase in tourist numbers and helped grow it into the largest city in Pinellas County. The city also adopted the Mediterranean-style architecture brought by Snell Isles founder Perry Snell.[11] An attraction that brought on a great number of tourists and citizens was the Million Dollar Pier which was built in 1926.[36]\\r\\nTourists declined by the late 1920s and early 1930s due to the Great Depression. Shortly after near the end of the Great Depression, the city recovered due to the help of the Public Works Administration with a $10 million investment plan which helped build the St. Petersburg City Hall.[11]\\r\\nBy the 1940s the city received a large population growth due to World War II. St. Petersburg was a training ground area for the U.S. Coast Guard who had a training base and used the city's Bayboro Harbor,[28] and for the Army Air Force who was selected by the War Department to use the city as their technical service training station.[37] With both stations occupying the city, more than 100,000 troops occupied all hotels in St. Petersburg.[38] After the war, most troops who were stationed in St. Petersburg returned as residents or tourists.[11]\\r\\nIn the 1950s, St. Petersburg experienced another population increase with residents. The development of transportation was important with the increase of tourists, more automobiles were used in the city and subsequently the public street cars were removed.[11] In 1954 the original Sunshine Skyway Bridge opened its first span to link St. Petersburg with Manatee County. A year later in 1955, Highway 19 opened in the city creating a large influx of traffic. By the end of the 1950s, tourists and retirees increased in the area.[39][40]\\r\\nThe development of major transportation continued into the 1960s with the completion of the Howard Frankland Bridge in 1960, creating another connection between St. Petersburg and Tampa.[40] St. Petersburg also received its first stadium named the Bayfront Center which hosted the first professional hockey league in Tampa Bay.[41][42] A new municipal marina and the Museum of Fine Arts were also built downtown.[11] St. Petersburg is home to one of the world's largest reclaimed water systems that was built in the 1970s which flows 37 million gallons of water per day to provide for customers located throughout the city.[43][44]\\r\\nFrom May to August 1968, 211 of the city's sanitation workers struck for higher wages. The strike began approximately one month after Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination in Memphis, Tennessee while supporting that city's sanitation workers strike.\\r\\nDevelopment of the first major league baseball team to be located in the Tampa Bay area began in St. Petersburg throughout the 1970s. The city tried to encourage numerous teams through the United States to make St. Petersburg their new tenant.[11] With the need of a major league baseball team, designs for a ballpark were first presented in 1983 and construction for a permanent dome stadium began in 1986.[45] The stadium opened in 1990 as the Florida Suncoast Dome, later named the Thunderdome in 1993. After many attempts to attract tenants to the new stadium, Major League Baseball gave St. Petersburg a franchise in 1995. In 1996, the dome was renamed a third time to Tropicana Field after naming rights were established with Tropicana Dole Beverages.[46] The Tampa Bay Devil Rays was then established in 1998 after the stadium's renovation and the new team played their first game on March 31, 1998, giving the Tampa Bay area their first professional baseball team.[47]\\r\\nThe city population continued to multiply during the 20th century, booming in the 1940s and 1950s and through the 1970s as the town became a popular retirement destination for Americans from midwestern cities, reaching 238,647 in the 1980 census. By that time, however, the population had leveled off, and has grown by only 10,000 since then. In the decade from 2000 to 2010, the population of the city dropped by approximately 4000 residents, while in the same period the population of Florida increased by over two and a half million residents.[48]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 137.6 square miles (356.4?km2). 61.7 square miles (159.9?km2) of it is land, and 75.9 square miles (196.5?km2) of it (55.13%) is water.[49] St. Petersburg is bordered by three bodies of water, the Old Tampa Bay, Middle Tampa Bay, and Lower Tampa Bay, all of which form the Tampa Bay.[50][51]\\r\\nDowntown St. Petersburg is the Central Business District, containing high rises for office use, most notably the tallest building in the city, One Progress Plaza. The Tampa Bay Times newspaper is headquartered in the downtown area.[52][53] The Poynter Institute, which owns the paper, is located on 3rd Street South.[54]\\r\\nThe Mahaffey Theater complex, the Morean Arts Center, dozens of other art galleries, Haslam's Bookstore, The Coliseum, Palladium Theatre, and Jannus Live are among the galleries and cultural venues featured downtown.[55] Several prominent museums are located in the perimeter. Many of them have received notable accolades, including the Chihuly Collection presented by the Morean Arts Center, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Salvador Dal Museum, the Florida International Museum, the St. Petersburg Museum of History, and the Florida Holocaust Museum.[55] The city hosts many outdoor festivals throughout the year.[56]\\r\\nSt. Petersburg's downtown has been rated among the best in the South. The area's beaches are a 10-mile (16?km) drive from downtown. Jutting a half mile into the bay was the St. Petersburg Pier, a major tourist attraction that offered various activities. \\"The Lens\\" design which was chosen by the International Design Competition Jury and accepted by City Council later had its contract terminated by a citywide election during the summer of 2013.[57][58] Following this, the \\"Pier Park\\" was chosen out of the 16 new design teams that submitted work in late 2014 and in 2015 the Pier Park was set for construction in early 2017.[36] Downtown also contains the University of South Florida St. Petersburg and a downtown branch of St. Petersburg College.[59][60] The downtown perimeter includes several parks, most of which are waterfront or lakefront. Straub Park is nearly a half mile long, boasts a waterfront location, and is home of the St. Petersburg Museum of Fine Arts.[61] The Vinoy Park Hotel has a bayfront location, a spot on the National Register of Historic Places,[62] and an AAA Four-Diamond rating.[63] It fronts Vinoy Park, which holds music festivals, including the Warped Tour. Nearby is the historic Tramor Cafeteria building, now part of the Tampa Bay Times. The city is connected via the Looper Trolley.[64]\\r\\nMost of the dining and nightlife can be found downtown on or near Central Avenue or Beach Drive along the waterfront. Venues include Jannus Live and the State Theatre. The active nightlife scene is credited to recent demographic and regulatory changes.[65][66] In 2010, the city council voted to extend bar hours until 3 A.M., identical to cross-bay \\"rival\\" Tampa.[67][68]\\r\\nTropicana Field, home of Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays, is located in the western part of downtown. Until 2008, the team played its spring training games at nearby Progress Energy Park. This setup was unique, making St. Petersburg the first city that played host to its baseball team during spring training as well as the regular season since the 1919 Philadelphia Athletics.[69] At the end of 2007, there was a debate over a new stadium to be built on the downtown waterfront at the current Progress Energy Park site. Tropicana Field would be demolished and replaced with prime residential and retail space. Completion of the stadium was planned for 2012; however, the proposal has been tabled indefinitely while a community-based organization investigates all alternatives for new stadium construction.[70][71][72]\\r\\nWhen the Wikimedia Foundation was founded by Jimmy Wales in 2003 it was originally located in downtown St. Petersburg. The foundation adopted its articles of incorporation in the city in 2005.[73] On September 25, 2007, the Foundation announced its move in late 2007 from St. Petersburg to the San Francisco Bay Area.[74][75]\\r\\nSt. Petersburg has the third-largest dedicated public waterfront park system in North America,[76] with a waterfront park system that stretches 7 miles (11?km) and is used year-round for public events, festivals and other activities.[77] In the early 20th century, citizens and city leaders engaged in a long and boisterous debate over the future of the young city's waterfront space, with one side advocating for commercial, port and industrial development and the other side advocating for a long-term commitment to parks and public access to the waterfront. The public access and park contingent won the debate when, on Christmas Eve 1909, the city announced the acquisition of the waterfront land that is encompassed by the waterfront park system.[78]\\r\\nThe city is also becoming one of the largest destinations in Florida for kiteboarding with locations such as Fort De Soto Park, Pass-a-Grille, and Ten-Cent.[79]\\r\\nThe St. Petersburg Shuffleboard Club was established in 1924 and gained attention as the \\"World's Largest Shuffleboard Club\\" with 110 courts and over 5,000 members in the 1950s and 1960s.[80]\\r\\nSt. Petersburg is home to more than 100 neighborhoods,[81] with most of the historic districts located near the bay.[82] In the eastern center of the city is Downtown St. Petersburg, which includes the cities residential and commercial skyscrapers, art galleries, museums, and parks.[83] The downtown area is home the central business district to many start-up companies, corporation branches, banks, law firms, and restaurants.[citation needed] Apart from downtown's business and cultural aesthetics, the area resides a branch of St. Petersburg College and the University of South Florida St. Petersburg.[83] Finally, the downtown district is home to two professional sports teams, the Tampa Bay Rays who reside west of downtown at Tropicana Field, and the Tampa Bay Rowdies who are located downtown at Al Lang Stadium.[83]\\r\\nNorth of Downtown St. Petersburg lies Historic Old Northeast and Snell Isle, both are a place of residence to Mediterranean style historic and waterfront homes, parks, and recreational areas.[84][85] Old Northeast is also home to a shopping district, city landmarks, beaches, and small shops as well as small residential high rises.[84] Snell Isle however was founded by C. Perry Snell who bought up the land to develop upscale properties in the 1900s, and helped create some of St. Petersburg's resorts such as the Vinoy Park Hotel and the St. Petersburg Woman's Club;[86] both of which are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.[87]\\r\\nThe western side of St. Petersburg includes the Grand Central District and Historic Kenwood. The Grand Central District houses the cities cafes, art galleries, restaurants, and bars all owing to the Renaissance style architecture.[88][89] Whilst in Historic Kenwood is filled with art studios and galleries similarly to the Grand Central District.[90]\\r\\nSouthward to St. Petersburg is Historic Roser Park, which houses Mediterranean style housing, parks, and museums.[91] The neighborhood is divided by Booker Creek which flows into Bayboro Harbor.[92][93]\\r\\nSt. Petersburg has a humid subtropical climate (Koppen Cfa), closely bordering a tropical savanna climate, with a definite rainy season from June through September. St. Petersburg, like the rest of the Tampa Bay area, is occasionally affected by tropical storms and hurricanes. However, the last time a hurricane directly struck the city was in 1946. Many portions of St. Petersburg, especially along the bay and in south St. Petersburg, have tropical micro-climates. Due to this royal palms and coconut palms, as well as other tropical plants can be found throughout the city. For the winter of 2014ÿ15, the lowest recorded temperature at the St. Petersburg Downtown Airport was 40 degrees Fahrenheit (four degrees Celsius), which the city recorded on February 20.[94] During the summer of 2015, the highest temperature recorded in the city was 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius), occurring on both June 16 and July 20.[94] St. Petersburg has not recorded any freezing temperatures in the five-year period dating back to November 2010, which is the oldest data available from the local National Weather Service office page.[95]\\r\\nAccording to a 2010 census, the city contained 244,769 people, making St. Petersburg the largest city in Pinellas County, and 129,401 households.

Two teams, the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball and Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League play in St. Petersburg proper, while the other two teams play across the bay in Tampa.[citation needed] All of the teams represent the entire Tampa Bay metropolitan area.\\r\\nThe Rays began play in 1998, finishing last in the American League's East Division in nine of the first ten seasons they played,[167] including their last year known as the \\"Devil Rays\\": 2007.[168] However, in 2008, their 11th season, they held off the Boston Red Sox and won the AL East Division Championship for the first time.[169] In the playoffs, they again faced the Red Sox in the ALCS.[170][171] They defeated Boston and won the American League Pennant.[172] However, they lost to the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2008 World Series.[173][174]\\r\\nFrom their inception until 2008, the Rays played their regular season games at Tropicana Field and their spring training games at historic Al Lang Stadium, formerly Progress Energy Park, giving them the unique distinction of being the only team in Major League Baseball that played its spring training games in their home city in more than 70 years.[citation needed] However, starting in 2009, the Rays have held spring training at Charlotte Sports Park in Port Charlotte, ending a 94-year streak of springtime baseball in the city.[175][176] Tropicana Field, the home venue of the Rays, played host to the 1999 Final Four.[177]\\r\\nSt. Petersburg is also home to the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, the inaugural race was held in April 2005.[178] The circuit itself is made of downtown streets passing Al Lang Stadium, the marina, and a runway in Albert Whitted Airport,[179] and streets are temporarily blocked off for the annual Indy Racing League's IndyCar Series race.[180] The race has been confirmed to return every year until at least 2017.[181] In 2012, the road intersecting Turn 10 was renamed Dan Wheldon Way in memory of Dan Wheldon, who won the 2005 race thanks to a move made on that turn.[182] Wheldon was killed in an accident at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway in the 2011 season finale.[183]\\r\\nThe Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League began to play at Al Lang Stadium in April 2011, moving from George M. Steinbrenner Field after the 2010 season. They initially were going to play at Al Lang Stadium for 2 years however,[184] on September 12, 2012, the Rowdies announced that they would be play at Al Lang stadium for a further 4 years.[184]\\r\\nAl Lang Stadium was named in honor of Al Lang, a former mayor of St. Petersburg who was responsible for bringing baseball spring training to the city in 1914.[185]\\r\\nSt. Petersburg is the home of many past and present sports icons. WBC and IBF Light Middleweight Champion Ronald \\"Winky\\" Wright,[186] and IBF, IBO, and WBO Champion Jeff Lacy hail from the area.[187] Ernest Givins, Stacey Simmons, William Floyd, and Pat Terrell are some of the famous retired National Football League players from the city. Shaun King, Marquel Blackwell, Aveion Cason, Darren Howard, Tim Carter, Kenny Heatly, and DeAndrew Rubin are some players currently in the NFL from the city. Major League Baseball pitcher Doug Waechter is also from St. Petersburg, as well as Minnesota Twins pitcher Boof Bonser. Indy Racing League driver and two-time Indianapolis 500 champion Dan Wheldon (2005 and 2011) resided in St. Petersburg prior to his death in October 2011.[188]\\r\\nThe Bay Area Pelicans Rugby Football Club has made their home in St. Petersburg since 1977. The Pelicans play in USA Rugby's Division II competing against teams throughout Florida and the United States.[189] Throughout its history, the teams have won honors as Florida Cup Champions as well as berths in National Championship Tournaments.[citation needed]\\r\\nDespite not having a team in the city since 2000 (with the St. Petersburg Devil Rays), St. Petersburg is home to Minor League Baseball's main headquarters.[190]\\r\\nThe International Shuffleboard Association was founded in St. Petersburg in 1979.[191]\\r\\nThe city of St. Petersburg has been governed under a strong mayor form of government since 1993. The Mayor of St. Petersburg and the St. Petersburg City Council members are elected for a four-year term and are limited to two consecutive terms. Currently the mayor of St. Petersburg is mayor Rick Kriseman who took office on January 2, 2014 with the legislative body consisting of the eight City Council members representing each of their designated city districts.[192][193]\\r\\nPublic primary and secondary schools in St. Petersburg are administered by Pinellas County Schools.

The University of South Florida St. Petersburg is an autonomous campus in the University of South Florida system.[195] The University of South Florida St. Petersburg serves 6,500 students. Eckerd College, founded in 1958, is a private four-year liberal arts college.[196] St. Petersburg College is a state college in the Florida College System.[196] Also in St. Petersburg is the Poynter Institute, a journalism institute which owns the Tampa Bay Times in a unique arrangement.[197] Also, Stetson Law School is located in Gulfport, which is adjacent to St. Pete between the south beaches.\\r\\nOther colleges and universities in the wider Tampa Bay Area include the University of South Florida and the University of Tampa located in Tampa and Hillsborough Community College, with campuses across Hillsborough County.[196]\\r\\nThe city's main daily morning newspapers are the Tampa Bay Times as well as its free daily sister publication tbt*.[198] Other newspapers available in the area are the daily St. Petersburg Tribune and the free weekly alternative newspaper Creative Loafing.[199] iLovetheBurg.com is an award-winning and popular online source of information for downtown St. Petersburg.[200]\\r\\nSt. Petersburg is in the Tampa-St. Petersburg television and radio markets.

It is also served by Interstates 175 and 375, which branch off I-275 into the southern and northern areas of downtown respectively.[211][212] The Gandy Bridge, conceived by George Gandy and opened in 1924, was the first causeway to be built across Tampa Bay, connecting St. Petersburg and Tampa cities without a circuitous 43-mile (69?km) trip around the bay through Oldsmar.[213]\\r\\nNearby Tampa International Airport provides air transportation for most passengers.[214] Smaller airlines, with destinations to smaller cities and towns, operate at St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport, with most tenants providing only seasonal services.[215] Albert Whitted Airport provides general aviation services near the heart of downtown St. Petersburg.[216][217]\\r\\nMass transit in St. Petersburg is provided by the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA). A sightseeing trolley, called The Looper, also travels to key downtown destinations daily such as USFSP, Sundial, Vinoy Hotel, and the multiple museums around the city.[218] The Looper costs only 50 cents to ride and provides free drop off points throughout the transit.[219][220]\\r\\nCSX Transportation operates a former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad branch line which sees daily rail traffic from north Tampa though Safety Harbor, Clearwater, and Largo.

It was introduced in the UK for a first examination in 1988 to replace O-level and CSE examinations.\\r\\nOne of the main changes to previous educational qualifications in the United Kingdom was to allow pupils to complete coursework during their two years of study, which was marked by their teachers and contributed to their final examination grade. There has been a move recently from doing coursework and modular examinations for part of the course when pupils would take exams throughout the course to an end-of-year exam after the two years of study (a \\"linear\\" series). The exams are being revised to make them more difficult such as testing skills from a whole text in English instead of part of a text. Coursework has now been replaced by Controlled Assessments in certain subjects, in which the student completes a number of assessed pieces of work that will ultimately count towards their final examination grade in the specified subject. The Controlled Assessment component of the qualification is usually done under exam-style conditions. After major GCSE reforms, coursework/controlled assessment generally have little to no influence on the final grade as opposed to the past.\\r\\nThe qualification is equivalent to a Level 1 or Level 2 (grade depending) Key Skills Qualification (in Scotland, the equivalent is a National 5). Some pupils may decide to take one or more GCSEs before or after they sit the others, and people may apply to take GCSEs at any point either internally through an institution or externally. A level 1 GCSE covers grades C to G or 1 to 5 (commonly referred to as the foundation tier) whereas a level 2 GCSE covers grades A* to C or 4 to 9 (commonly referred to as the higher tier). Five level 2 GCSEs, including English and maths, are generally required (as well as an A or B in the specific subject) to continue to the level 3 Advanced GCE level (A-Level) or equivalent level 3 qualifications. From September 2017, grades will be awarded from 9 to 1, a grade 9 being equivalent to an upper A* and a grade 1 being marginally better than a U (unclassified in the former system). Some schools start GCSEs in year 9. It is also the equivalent to Junior Certifcate examinations in the Republic of Ireland.\\r\\nThe education systems of current and former British territories, such as Gibraltar,[1] and Nigeria, also offer the qualification, as supplied by the same examination boards. Other former British colonies, such as Singapore and Zimbabwe, continue to use the O-level qualification.[2] The international version of the GCSE is the IGCSE, which can be taken anywhere in the world and includes additional options relating to coursework and the language the qualification is pursued in. All subjects completed in the fifth of the European Baccalaureate are generally equivalent to the GCSEs subjects.\\r\\nPrior education to GCSE level is generally required of pupils wishing to pursue A Level courses or the BTEC Extended Diploma and International Baccalaureate. GCSE exams were introduced as the compulsory school-leavers' examinations by the government of the United Kingdom. GCSE examinations are typically taken at the age of 16 but may be taken at any age.\\r\\nBTECs can also be taken. These are marked with a different grading system: level one, grades DÿG, and level two, pass (C), merit (B), distinction (A), and distinction* (A*) (pronounced distinction-star). New regulations require that BTECs now include some form of examination, usually done online. The difference between BTECs and GCSEs is that the BTEC course is heavily coursework-based.\\r\\nAt the end of the two-year GCSE course, towards the end of August of that year, candidates receive a grade for each subject that they have sat. Before the transformation of the GCSE grading system from alphabetical to numeric grades, the pass grades, from highest to lowest, were: A* (pronounced \\"A-star\\"), A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Grade U (ungraded/unclassified) signifies that a pupil achieved nothing worthy of credit; therefore, no GCSE is awarded to the pupil in that subject. For GCSEs after reformations, the pass grades are 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, but a \\"good pass\\" which is generally required, is grade 4 or higher. The U grade stays the same as mentioned above.\\r\\nBroadly, the same proportion of students will achieve 4 and above as currently achieve C and above, and the same proportion of students will achieve grade 7 and above as currently achieve A or A*.[3]\\r\\nGCSEs are part of the National Qualifications Framework. A GCSE at grades D to G (or grades 3 to 1) is a Level 1 qualification, while a GCSE at grades A* to C (grades 9 to 4) is a Level 2 qualification. GCSEs at A* to C or 9 to 4 (Level 2) are much more desirable and insisted on by many employers and educational institutions. Level 2 qualifications are usually required to advance to Level 3 qualifications.\\r\\nPupils can also receive an X grade, which signifies that they have completed only part of the course or that key elements such as coursework are missing, and so an appropriate grade cannot be given. A Q (query) grade means that the clarification is needed by the exam board, which the school should contact. Both X and Q are normally temporary grades and replaced with a regular grade (A* to G or 9 to U) when the situation has been resolved.\\r\\nX grades are also very rarely used by some exam boards to indicate that the examiner found offending material, usually hate speech, within one of the exam papers that a pupil took. In some cases, this may cause the pupil to lose all marks for that particular paper and occasionally for the entire course. X grades are most common in subjects where ethical issues are raised and/or there is a question that requires the pupil to express his/her personal opinion on a scientific/religious view. Notable areas where this can occur are biology and religious education/studies.\\r\\nThe 2017 GCSE reforms changed the grading system as follows: instead of grades ranging from A* to U, they range from 9 to 1, with 9 being the highest grade. This was introduced because students' average performance was increasing each year, with a larger number of pupils achieving A*. The change to the grading system allows the exam boards to increase the difficulty of the exams and therefore discriminate better between pupils who achieve the highest grades and get a closer representation of the pupils' capabilities. It also enables the exam board to add higher grades if pupils' attainment increases further. English and maths exams are being trialled using the new grading system in the 2017 exams.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many subjects, there are two different 'Tiers' of examination offered:\\r\\nIf a candidate fails to obtain at least a Grade G on the Foundation Tier or a Grade E on the Higher tier they fail the course and receive a U. Candidates who narrowly miss a Grade D on the Higher Tier, however, are awarded a Grade E. In the old style modular subjects, pupils may mix and match tiers between units. In non-tiered subjects, such as History, the examination paper allows candidates to achieve any grade. Coursework and controlled assessment also always allows candidates to achieve any grade.\\r\\nThe GCSE Mathematics exam syllabus changed from a 3-Tier systemFoundation grades (D to G), Intermediate (grades B to E) and Higher (grades A* to C)to the standard 2-Tier system described above.\\r\\nSource: Joint Council for General Qualifications via Brian Stubbs.\\r\\nNote: In the final year DES statistics for O-Levels are available, and across all subjects, 6.8% of candidates obtained a grade A, and 39.8% and A to C.\\r\\nUK GCSE classifications\\r\\nReceiving five or more A*ÿC grades, including English and Maths, is often a requirement for taking A-levels and BTEC Level 3 at a sixth form college or at a further education college after leaving secondary school. Where the choice of A level is a subject taken at GCSE level, it is frequently required that the pupil has received a GCSE C grade minimum. Most universities typically require a C or better in English and Mathematics, regardless of a pupil's performance in their A-level, BTEC or Foundation Degree course after leaving school. Many pupils who fail to get a C in English and Mathematics will retake their GCSEs in those subjects at a later date, in order to take further education (A-levels or BTEC) at a sixth form college. As well as choosing to take A-Levels after GCSEs, pupils can also choose to do BTEC courses. Some pupils do them alongside A-Levels and they count for 1 or 2 A-Levels. However some pupils may go to a college to study only what is known as a BTEC Extended Diploma in one certain subject. This course is two years long and pupils can earn the necessary 3 A-Levels required to gain a university place. The reason some pupils decide to take a BTEC is because it allows them to focus solely on an area they are certain to go into in the future, often in a vocational and practical way.\\r\\nLeading universities often take into account performance at GCSE level, sometimes expecting applicants to have a high proportion of A and A* grades.[6][7][8][9]\\r\\nIn some subjects, one or more controlled assessment assignments may also be completed. Controlled assessment can contribute to anything from 10ÿ60% of a pupil's final grade, with more practical subjects, such as design and technology (60%), art (60%), ICT (60%), music (60%) and English (40%) often having a heavier coursework element. The rest of a pupil's grade (normally the majority) is determined by their performance in examinations. After the GCSE reformations, there is less emphasis on coursework and qualifications are awarded either mostly or entirely on exams. These exams may either be terminal exams at the end of Year 11, a series of modular examinations or taken throughout the course, or a combination of the two. Pupils can sometimes resit modular examinations later in the course and attempt to improve their grade.\\r\\nOne positive to Controlled assessment is that it can help to ease the stress of examination because pupils can earn a percentage of their final exam grade earlier in the year. The downside is that this means pupils have a greater workload to complete, sometimes having to produce a large amount of work for a minimal part of the overall grade. For example, in English, a pupil may have to complete 4 pieces of coursework, each over a thousand words long, which individually only account for 5% of the grade. However, this varies between exam boards.\\r\\nControlled assessment is usually completed outside of lessons, however concerns about cheating have meant that more and more is now being completed in the classroom, under supervision. For many courses, including those in Economics, Science and History, a requirement is meanwhile that controlled assessment is completed in a controlled environment within schools. Design and Technology subjects also switch to the new, more controlled, environment, with time limits and restrictions on the variety of projects allowed.[10] A governmental survey investigation shows that most teachers are deeply dissatisfied with controlled assessment.\\r\\nThe curriculum and awarding of GCSEs has always been performed by a number of independent Examination groups, initially under the supervision of the National Curriculum Council (NCC) and the School Examinations and Assessment Council (SEAC). This oversight has subsequently been passed onto the: School Curriculum and Assessment Authority (SCAA), Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ), Awdurdod Cymwysterau, Cwricwlwm ac Asesu Cymru (ACCAC), The Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual), and Qualifications Wales (QW).\\r\\nThere are now five UK examination boards offering GCSEs:\\r\\nWhile all boards are regulated by the government of the United Kingdom, the boards are self-sufficient organisations. Traditionally there were a larger number of regional exam boards but changes in legislation allowed schools to use any board before a series of mergers reduced the number to five.\\r\\nPupils receive the results of their GCSEs in the fourth week of August (the week after A Level results). CCEA publish their results on Tuesday, and the other examination boards publish theirs on Thursday. Normally, pupils have to go to their school to collect their results, although Edexcel allow for the option of an online results service.[11]\\r\\nThere have been comments that the GCSE system is a dumbing down from the old GCE O-level system (as it took the focus away from the theoretical side of many subjects, and taught pupils about real-world implications and issues relating to ICT and citizenship).[12]\\r\\nIn addition, GCSE grades have been rising for many years, which critics attribute to grade inflation. By comparing pupils' scores in the YELLIS ability test with their GCSE results within a period of approximately 20 years, Robert Coe found a general increase in results which ranges from 0.2 (Science) to 0.8 (Maths) of a GCSE grade.[13] Only slightly more than half of pupils sitting GCSE exams achieve the 5 A* to C grades required for most forms of academic further education.[14]\\r\\nOne of the important differences between previous educational qualifications (and the earlier grading of A-levels) and the later GCSE qualifications was supposed to be a move from norm-referenced marking to criterion-referenced marking.[15] On a norm-referenced grading system, fixed percentages of candidates achieve each grade. With criterion-referenced grades, in theory, all candidates who achieve the criteria can achieve the grade. A comparison of a clearly norm-referenced assessment, such as the NFER Cognitive Ability Test or CAT, with GCSE grading seems to show an unexpected correlation, which challenges the idea that the GCSE is a properly criterion-based assessment.[16]\\r\\nThe incorporation of GCSE awards into school league tables, and the setting of School level targets, at above national average levels of attainment, has been criticized. At the time of introduction the E grade was intended to be equivalent to the CSE grade 4, and so obtainable by a candidate of average/median ability;[17] Sir Keith Joseph set Schools a target to have 90% of their pupil obtain a minimum of a grade F (which was the average grade achieved in the past), the target was eventually achieved nationally approximately 20 years later. David Blunkett went further and set schools the goal of ensuring 50% of 16-year olds gained 5 GCSEs or equivalent at grade C and above, requiring schools to devise a means for 50% of their pupils to achieve the grades previously only obtained by the top 30%, this was achieved with the help of equivalent and largely vocational qualifications.[18] Labelling Schools failing if they are unable to achieve at least 5 Cs, including English and Maths at GCSE, for 40% of their pupils has also been criticised, as it essentially requires 40% of each intake to achieve the grades only obtained by the top 20% at the time of the qualifications introduction.[19][20]\\r\\nIn recent years, concerns about standards has led some public schools to go as far as to complement GCSEs with IGCSEs within their curriculum, and to take their pupils straight[not in citation given] to A-level or the BTEC.[21] Other public schools, such as the Manchester Grammar School, are replacing the GCSEs with IGCSEs in which there is an option to do no coursework.[22] The new Science syllabus has led to many public schools switching to the IGCSE Double Award syllabus.[23]\\r\\nIn recent years, there were a number of complaints that GCSEs and GCE A-levels were marked unfairly (teachers and pupils also have the option to question exam results by signing up for re-marking procedures should they feel results don't reflect a pupil's ability and expectations or if, after having reviewed a (copy) of the exam script, detect a marking error), following a decision to change the grade boundaries. Recently for the first time in the entire history of the exams the proportion of all GCSEs awarded an A*-C grade fell.[24]\\r\\nMoreover, the publication of \\"soft\\" subjects (e.g. Critical Thinking, General Studies etc.) and \\"academic\\" subjects (e.g. Mathematics, Sciences, Languages) for GCSEs and A-Levels by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge has created an ongoing educational debate where, on the one hand, many educational experts would support this \\"division of importance\\" whereas, on the other hand, many head teachers would not only disagree but actually \\"oppose a move to solely traditional academic GCSE (and A-Level) subjects\\".[25]\\r\\nAlso, the OECD has expressed its concerns over potential grade inflation of GCSEs and A-Levels in the UK in a published report where the OECD put forward the theory that exam boards may be competing for candidates by lowering standards to secure more entries despite the British government overseeing exam standards.[26][27]\\r\\nGender bias is another area of concern. Department of Education data shows that the relative performance gap between boys and girls widened significantly under GCSEs, compared with O-levels.[28]\\r\\nAnother incident includes a GCSE Maths exam paper where there were complaints about a question later named in the media as the 'Hannah's sweets' question. Users of Twitter complained that they found the question difficult and/or unintelligible, which was reported on several media websites. However, after the situation calmed down, several teachers, experts, and students delivered the solution to the question via the media.[29]\\r\\nIn another case, concerning the 2016 GCSE biology exam, students took to twitter to complain about the apparent lack of Biology content in the exam.[30][31][32][33]\\r\\nMore recently, the May 2017 English literature exam (under the regulation of OCR) implied that Tybalt, a villainous, fictional character in 'Romeo and Juliet' was not a Capulet. This serious flaw in the question confused many of the students. OCR accepted responsibility and claimed no pupil would be disadvantaged. The question was worth 40 marks. This has led to doubt about the competence of the board who had 3 years to set the paper.\\r\\nGCSEs were first introduced in 1988[34] to establish a national qualification for school-leavers who decided to leave school at 16 and not to pursue further academic studies and qualifications such as A-Levels or university degrees. They were introduced to replace former British educational credentials such as the CSE (Certificate of Secondary Education) and the O-Level qualifications, which had been criticised for failing the bottom 42% of O-level entrants and the brightest CSE entrants. The former failed to achieve a qualification, despite being identified as being in the top 30% academically, and the latter failed to offer a means to differentiate the achievement of the brightest CSE candidates. A single merged qualification was proposed that would resolve these issues by utilising an extended alphabetic grading system, with a GCSE grade C originally intended to be equivalent to the O-Level Grade C and CSE Grade 1, and so achievable by the top ~25% of each cohort. Earlier in the 1980s, a trial \\"16+\\" examination was available in some subjects, awarding both an O-level certificate and a CSE certificate. For exams after the major GCSE reformations, for different subjects, qualifications are now graded on a 9-1 scale, with 9 being the highest and 1 being the lowest.\\r\\nNote: Historically an:\\r\\nOnly very rough comparisons can be made between grades awarded in the O Level / CSE system and GCSE system at different times. However, the following table represents a very approximate estimate of how they might be compared. For example: on average, the new grade 9 corresponds approximately to the top two-thirds of the A* grade:\\r\\nThe subjects offered, format, regulation, content and grading of the GCSE examinations has altered considerably over time, with numerous additional subjects now being offered in the: modern languages, ancient languages, vocational, and expressive art arenas, along with a Citizenship course.[36] The largest change has been the change of grading to numerical which encourages A* students to work harder so that a 9 grade shows outstanding distinction in a subject. Another change to the grading has been the introduction of the A* grade to distinguish those candidates who achieve a low A grade from those who achieve a high A grade.[37]\\r\\nThe A* grade was introduced to distinguish the very top end of achievement,[38] although the threshold for achieving an A* has varied considerably over the past, coming down as low as 47% in an AQA Business Studies GCSE paper.[39] This could be a reason why the '9' grade was added in to distinguish between the highest achievers.\\r\\nInitially, most exams had two tiers: Higher, offering grades A to E (A* to E), and Basic, offering Grades F to G. The Higher tier was later modified to cover grades A* to D, while the Basic tier was renamed Foundation and now covered grades C to G.[40] In addition, an 'allowed' Grade E was introduced to the Higher tier for candidates narrowly missing a Grade D.\\r\\nFor many years, Maths was an exception, having three tiers: Higher (grades A* to C), Intermediate (grades B to E) and Basic/Foundation (grades D to G). However, Maths then moved to the standard two-tier system.\\r\\nAn alternative GCSE format was the Vocational GCSE (VGCSE), which encouraged pupils to take the work-related route and included courses such as Engineering and Manufacture, Applied Business, ICT, and Leisure and Tourism. Later on, the word 'Vocational' was dropped and a former Vocational GCSE is now known simply as a GCSE.\\r\\nScience GCSEs were overhauled in over the past years. Pupils studying for two Science GCSEs now study the single Science GCSE (known as core science) and then one of two complementary GCSEs: Additional Science GCSE (which has a more academic focus) or Applied Science GCSE (which has a more vocational focus). Candidates now receive separate grades for each of their Science GCSEs.\\r\\nGCSE examinations in state education are taken officially in the summer, though many schools take mocks beforehand. GCSE examination results are received on a specified date in the summer, and due to this, the examinations are always taken near the end of the academic year (unless in private education). GCSEs are externally marked examinations, taken between April and July - unless a pupil has specific reasons to be entitled to an extension of permitted time.\\r\\nThere were further changes to the English GCSEs. Instead of the current system where (virtually) all pupils take English and the vast majority also take English Literature, pupils will take English Language and English Literature together or just English on its own, which will effectively be a hybrid of the other two GCSEs.[41]\\r\\nThe youngest pupil to gain a GCSE is home-educated Arran Fernandez, who took GCSE Mathematics at the age of five, gaining grade D, the highest available at Foundation Tier at that time.[42] He also became the youngest ever pupil to gain an A* grade, also for GCSE Mathematics.[43] The current record for the youngest pupil to gain an A* grade is held by Thomas Barnes, who earned an A* in GCSE Mathematics at the age of 7.[44]\\r\\nThe leading examining body, AQA (formally known as the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance) had proposed amendments to the present format of GCSEs and it has said the marking system is the purpose of its changes and these are intended to revise the method used for grading the examinations set at GCSE level. The improvements that the government in the United Kingdom had decided are going to happen and they will be the focus of its revision plan that is aimed at giving a more perfect structure to England's exam system. However, there are some problems with revising exams are marked, meaning that the proportion of candidates who have the opportunity to gain the best grades will fall.[45]\\r\\nThe executive manager and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation Glenys Stacey explained further to this point that the way that they will be taking the slant on the first year candidates will begin sitting the revised version that it is meant taking great consideration towards the evidence of numbers. By these means it is expected to be more straightforward when determining where the grade positions are going to appear in the framework having the purpose that will be followed when the method used for recording the marks in grade tables giving further clarity to teachers and candidates about the revisions to the marking system used at the moment so that the appearance of the grade tables when submitted reflects the changes. This will make sure that the year group pupils are not disadvantaged or advantaged because of the introduction of the new qualifications, and will provide some certainty about what to expect at this time of significant change. Brian Lightman, the head of the Association of School and College Leaders, gave this point: \\"Harder exams in themselves do not lead to higher standards. Excellent teaching and clear leadership are what enable pupils to achieve more.\\"\\r\\nModular VS Linear Controversy:\\r\\nThe Conservative Party under Prime Minister David Cameron initiated reforms for A Levels and GCSEs to change from the current modular to a linear structure.[46][47][48] British Examination Boards (Edexcel, AQA and OCR) regulated and accredited by the government of the United Kingdom responded to the government's reform announcements by modifying syllabi of several A Level and GCSE [46][48] subjects.[49] However, the Labour Party and in particular the Member of Parliament Tristram Hunt announced that it will halt and reverse the reforms and maintain the modular A-Level and GCSE system.[50] In addition, the Labour Party, Tristram Hunt and the current modular GCSE and A-Level system are supported and promoted by the University of Oxford and by the University of Cambridge.[51][52][53]\\r\\nStatistics released by Londons Poverty Profile found overall GCSE attainment in London to be greater than the rest of England. 39% of pupils in Inner London and 37% in Outer London did not get five GCSEs at A* to C, compared with 42% in the rest of England.[54] Also, according to an ITV News report, UK students tend to outperform Jersey students on GCSE examinations.[55]\\r\\nThe declining number of pupils studying foreign languages in the UK has been a major concern of educational experts for many years. Paul Steer, the Exam Board Chief of the British exam board OCR recently expressed that \\"unless we act soon, even GCSE French and German could face the chop\\".[56]\\r\\nGCSEs have been reformed and altered significantly ever since they have been introduced. The main differences after the reformed exams are [57] a new grading system of 9 to 1 with 9 being the highest grade, representing the top half of current grade A*. Assessment is mainly based on exams, with little or no coursework. The exams are developed to be 'more demanding' and 'better preparation for work'. Changes are coming into effect in phases.\\r\\nThe 'phase 1' of the GCSE reformations incorporates the subjects of English language, English literature and Mathematics.\\r\\nThe 'phase 2' of the GCSE reformations concerns ancient languages (classical Greek, Latin), art and design, biology, chemistry, citizenship studies, computer science, dance, double science, drama, food preparation and nutrition, geography, history, modern foreign languages (French, German, Spanish), music, physics, physical education and religious studies.\\r\\nThe 'phase 3' of the GCSE reformations includes ancient history, astronomy, business, classical civilisation, design and technology, economics, electronics, engineering, film studies, geology, media studies, most other modern foreign languages (such as Mandarin Chinese or Bengali) psychology, sociology and statistics.\\r\\nFinally, the 'phase 4' of the GCSE reformations regards the remaining modern foreign languages (Gujarati, biblical Hebrew, Persian, Portuguese and Turkish).\\r\\nFor pupils with learning difficulties, an injury/repetitive strain injury (RSI) or a disability, help is offered in these forms:\\r\\nAll of the above must be approved by the exam board concerned. There are other forms of help available, but these are the most commonly used. Pupils working below GCSE level may take a different qualification altogether in one or more subjects. The Entry Level Certificate, in particular, is designed for this purpose. There are also other qualifications which can be taken such as BTECs, which are specially designed for pupils with learning difficulties and other special needs.\\r\\nEnquiries for re-marking of GCSE examinations:\\r\\nPupils and Teachers have the option to enquire re-marking of a pupil's GCSE exams if they feel the result does not reflect the pupil's expectation and/or ability or, after having reviewed a copy of the pupil's exam script, they detect a marking error.\\r\\nIn the United States, the high school diploma is the required educational qualification for entry into college.\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the high school diploma is considered to be at the level of the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), which is awarded at Year 11.[58][59] For college and university admissions, the high school diploma may be accepted in lieu of the GCSE if an average grade better than D+ is obtained in subjects with a GCSE counterpart.[58]\\r\\nAs the more academically rigorous A Levels awarded at Year 13 are expected for university admission, the high school diploma alone is generally not considered to meet university requirements. Pupils who wish to study in the United Kingdom may additionally participate in the Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) programs, which are considered to be at the level of the A Level qualifications and earn points on the UCAS Tariff,[58][60] or may opt to take A Level examinations in British international schools or as private candidates. College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) tests, such as the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, or the ACT, may also be considered.\\r\\nThe Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) recommends that in addition to a high school diploma, grades of 3 or above in at least two, or ideally three, Advanced Placement exams may be considered as meeting general entry requirements for admission.[58] The IB Diploma may also be accepted. For the College Entrance Examination Board tests, a minimum score of 600 or higher in all sections of the SAT or a minimum score of 26 or higher in all sections of the ACT along with a minimum score of 600 in relevant SAT Subject Tests may be considered as meeting general entry requirements for admission.[58]\\r\\nMany of the subjects in this list are not available in every school.\\r\\nSeveral other science based GCSEs are available to pupils in many schools. These include GCSE Astronomy and Geology.","input":"What is a general certificate of secondary education?"},{"output":"Geometric","context":"Ancient Greek pottery, due to its relative durability, comprises a large part of the archaeological record of ancient Greece, and since there is so much of it (over 100,000 painted vases are recorded in the Corpus vasorum antiquorum),[1] it has exerted a disproportionately large influence on our understanding of Greek society. The shards of pots discarded or buried in the 1st millennium BC are still the best guide available to understand the customary life and mind of the ancient Greeks. There were several vessels produced locally for everyday and kitchen use, yet finer pottery from regions such as Attica was imported by other civilizations throughout the Mediterranean, such as the Etruscans in Italy.[2] There were various specific regional varieties, such as the South Italian ancient Greek pottery.\\r\\nThroughout these places, various types and shapes of vases were used. Not all were purely utilitarian; large Geometric amphorae were used as grave markers, kraters in Apulia served as tomb offerings and Panathenaic Amphorae seem to have been looked on partly as objets dart, as were later terracotta figurines. Some were highly decorative and meant for elite consumption and domestic beautification as much as serving a storage or other function, such as the krater with its usual use in diluting wine.\\r\\nEarlier Greek styles of pottery, called \\"Aegean\\" rather than \\"Ancient Greek\\", include Minoan pottery, very sophisticated by its final stages, Cycladic pottery, Minyan ware and then Mycenaean pottery in the Bronze Age, followed by the cultural disruption of the Greek Dark Age. As the culture recovered Sub-Mycenaean pottery finally blended into the Protogeometric style, which begins Ancient Greek pottery proper.\\r\\nThe rise of vase painting saw increasing decoration. Geometric art in Greek pottery was contiguous with the late Dark Age and early Archaic Greece, which saw the rise of the Orientalizing period. The pottery produced in Archaic and Classical Greece included at first black-figure pottery, yet other styles emerged such as red-figure pottery and the white ground technique. Styles such as West Slope Ware were characteristic of the subsequent Hellenistic period, which saw vase painting's decline.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInterest in Greek art lagged behind the revival of classical scholarship during the Renaissance and revived in the academic circle round Nicholas Poussin in Rome in the 1630s. Though modest collections of vases recovered from ancient tombs in Italy were made in the 15th and 16th centuries these were regarded as Etruscan. It is possible that Lorenzo de Medici bought several Attic vases directly from Greece;[3] however the connection between them and the examples excavated in central Italy was not made until much later. Winckelmann's Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums of 1764 first refuted the Etruscan origin of what we now know to be Greek pottery[4] yet Sir William Hamilton's two collections, one lost at sea the other now in the British Museum, were still published as \\"Etruscan vases\\"; it would take until 1837 with Stackelberg's Gr?ber der Hellenen to conclusively end the controversy.[5]\\r\\nMuch of the early study of Greek vases took the form of production of albums of the images they depict, however neither D'Hancarville's nor Tischbein's folios record the shapes or attempt to supply a date and are therefore unreliable as an archaeological record. Serious attempts at scholary study made steady progress over the 19th century starting with the founding of the Instituto di Corrispondenza in Rome in 1828 (later the German Archaeological Institute), followed by Eduard Gerhard's pioneering study Auserlesene Griechische Vasenbilder (1840 to 1858), the establishment of the journal Archaeologische Zeitung in 1843 and the Ecole d'Athens 1846. It was Gerhard who first outlined the chronology we now use, namely: Orientalizing (Geometric, Archaic), Black Figure, Red Figure, Polychromatic (Hellenistic).\\r\\nFinally it was Otto Jahn's 1854 catalogue Vasensammlung of the Pinakothek, Munich, that set the standard for the scientific description of Greek pottery, recording the shapes and inscriptions with a previously unseen fastidousness. Jahn's study was the standard textbook on the history and chronology of Greek pottery for many years, yet in common with Gerhard he dated the introduction of the red figure technique to a century later than was in fact the case. This error was corrected when the Aϫٻ 'ֶϫϚϫ undertook the excavation of the Acropolis in 1885 and discovered the so-called \\"Persian debris\\" of red figure pots destroyed by Persian invaders in 480 BC. With a more soundly established chronology it was possible for Adolf Furtw?ngler and his students in the 1880s and 90s to date the strata of his archaeological digs by the nature of the pottery found within them, a method of seriation Flinders Petrie was later to apply to unpainted Egyptian pottery.\\r\\nWhere the 19th century was a period of discovery and the laying out of first principles, the 20th century has been one of consolidation and intellectual industry. Efforts to record and publish the totality of public collections of vases began with the creation of the Corpus vasorum antiquorum under Edmond Pottier and the Beazley archive of John Beazley.\\r\\nBeazley and others following him have also studied fragments of Greek pottery in institutional collections, and have attributed many painted pieces to individual artists. Scholars have called these fragments disjecta membra (Latin for \\"scattered parts\\") and in a number of instances have been able to identify fragments now in different collections that belong to the same vase.[6]\\r\\nThe names we use for Greek vase shapes are often a matter of convention rather than historical fact, a few do illustrate their own use or are labeled with their original names, others are the result of early archaeologists attempt to reconcile the physical object with a known name from Greek literature ÿ not always successfully. To understand the relationship between form and function Greek pottery may be divided in four broad categories, given here with common types:[2][7]\\r\\nSome vase shapes were especially associated with rituals, others with athletics and the gymnasium.[8] Within each category the forms are roughly the same in scale and whether open or closed, where there is uncertainty we can make good proximate guesses of what use a piece would have served. Some have a purely ritual function, for example white ground lekythoi contained the oil used as funerary offerings and appear to have been made solely with that object in mind. Many examples have a concealed second cup inside them to give the impression of being full of oil, as such they would have served no other useful gain.\\r\\nThere was an international market for Greek pottery since the 8th century BC, which Athens and Corinth dominated down to the end of the 4th century BC.[9] An idea of the extent of this trade can be gleaned from plotting the find maps of these vases outside of Greece, though this could not account for gifts or immigration. Only the existence of a second hand market could account for the number of panathenaics found in Etruscan tombs. South Italian wares came to dominate the export trade in the Western Mediterranean as Athens declined in political importance during the Hellenistic period.\\r\\nThe process of making a pot and firing it is fairly simple. The first thing a potter needs is clay. Attica's high-iron clay gave its pots an orange color.[10]\\r\\nWhen clay is first dug out of the ground it is full of rocks and shells and other useless items that need to be removed. To do this the potter mixes the clay with water and lets all the impurities sink to the bottom. This is called levigation or elutriation. This process can be done many times. The more times this is done, the smoother clay becomes.\\r\\nThe clay is then kneaded by the potter and placed on a wheel. Once the clay is on the wheel the potter can shape it into any of the many shapes shown below, or anything else he desires. Wheel made pottery dates back to roughly 2500 BC where before the coil method of building the walls of the pot was employed. Most Greek vases were wheel-made, though as with the Rhyton mould-made pieces (so-called \\"plastic\\" pieces) are also found and decorative elements either hand formed or by mould were added to thrown pots. More complex pieces were made in parts then assembled when it was leather hard by means of joining with a slip, where the potter returned to the wheel for the final shaping, or turning. Sometimes, a young man helped turn the wheel.[12][13]\\r\\nThe pots were usually made in sections such as the body and feet and spout. Even the body, if it were larger than 20 centimeters, might be made in separate sections and glued together later with a thin watery clay called slip. After the pot is made then the potter paints it with a very pure black slip made from a specially prepared clay [14] using brushes made from a single hair.[15] It was thus slipped and then incised ready for the kiln.\\r\\nPreviously it was believed that Greek pottery, unlike today's pottery, was only fired once, but that firing had three stages. New studies instead provide material evidence that the pottery was made with two or more separate firings [16] in which the pottery is subjected to multiple firing stages. The most commonly described sequence of firing stages is one in which the pottery is stacked inside the kiln the potter heats the kiln up to around 800?C with all the vents on the sides open to let air in. This turns the pottery and the paint red all over. Once the kiln reaches 800?C the vents are closed and the temperature is raised to 950?C and then allowed to drop back to 900?C. This turns the pottery and the paint all black. The potter then starts the third and final phase by opening the vents and allowing the kiln to cool all the way down. This last phase leaves the slip black but turns the pottery back to red. This happens because when the clay is given air it turns red, but when the black slip is heated to 950?C it no longer allows air in. Thus, the slipped area stays black while the bare areas stay red. While the description of a single firing with three stages may seem economical and efficient, it is equally possible that each of these stages was confined to separate firings.\\r\\nThe striking black slip with a metallic sheen, so characteristic of Greek pottery, was a fine suspension (colloidal fraction) of an illitic clay with very low calcium oxide content which was rich in iron oxides and hydroxides, differentiating from that used for the body of the vase in terms of the calcium content, the exact mineral composition and the particle size. This clay suspension was most probably collected in situ from illitic clay beds and was then processed through levigation. To aid in the levigation step, it is likely that the Attic black slip was treated with deflocculants as indicated by trace levels of contaminants to the clay, such as Zn associated with vitriol.[14] This clay suspension was thickened by concentration to a paste and was used for the decoration of the surface of the vase. The paint was applied on the areas intended to become black after firing.\\r\\nThe black color effect was achieved by means of changing the amount of oxygen present during firing. This was done in a process known as three-phase firing and was likely accomplished with multiple firings of the pottery. First, the kiln was heated to around 920ÿ950?C, with all vents open bringing oxygen into the firing chamber and turning both pot and slip a reddish-brown (oxidising conditions) due to the formation of hematite (Fe2O3) in both the paint and the clay body. Then the vent was closed and green wood introduced, creating carbon monoxide which turns the red hematite to black magnetite (Fe3O4); at this stage the temperature decreases due to incomplete combustion. In a final reoxidizing phase (at about 800ÿ850?C) the kiln was opened and oxygen reintroduced causing the unslipped reserved clay to go back to orange-red. In the previous phase, chemical composition of the slipped surface had been altered, so it could no longer be oxidized and remained black. The technique which is mostly known as the \\"iron reduction technique\\" was decoded with the contribution of scholars, ceramists and scientists since the mid 18th century onwards to the end of 20th century, i.e. Comte de Caylus (1752), Durand-Greville (1891), Binns and Fraser (1925), Schumann (1942), Winter (1959), Bimson (1956), Noble (1960, 1965), Hofmann (1962), Oberlies (1968), Pavicevic (1974), Aloupi (1993), Walton (2009), Walton (2014).[17]\\r\\nThe most familiar aspect of ancient Greek pottery is painted vessels of fine quality. These were not the everyday pottery used by most people but were sufficiently cheap to be accessible to a wide range of the population.\\r\\nFew examples of ancient Greek painting have survived so modern scholars have to trace the development of ancient Greek art partly through ancient Greek vase-painting, which survives in large quantities and is also, with Ancient Greek literature, the best guide we have to the customary life and mind of the ancient Greeks.\\r\\nFine painting on Greek pottery goes back to the Minoan pottery and Mycenaean pottery of the Bronze Age, some later examples of which show the ambitious figurative painting that was to become highly developed and typical. After many centuries dominated by styles of geometric decoration, becoming increasingly complex, figurative elements returned in force in the 8th century. From the late 7th century to about 300 BC evolving styles of figure-led painting were at their peak of production and quality and were widely exported.\\r\\nDuring the Greek Dark Age, spanning the 11th to 8th centuries BC, the prevalent early style was that of the protogeometric art, predominantly utilizing circular and wavy decorative patterns. This was succeeded in mainland Greece, the Aegean, Anatolia, and Italy by the style of pottery known as geometric art, which employed neat rows of geometric shapes.[18]\\r\\nThe period of Archaic Greece, beginning in the 8th century BC and lasting until the late 5th century BC, saw the birth of Orientalizing period, led largely by ancient Corinth, where the previous stick-figures of the geometric pottery become fleshed out amid motifs that replaced the geometric patterns.[9]\\r\\nVases of the protogeometrical period (c. 1050ÿ900 BC) represent the return of craft production after the collapse of the Mycenaean Palace culture and the ensuing Greek dark ages. It is one of the few modes of artistic expression besides jewelry in this period since the sculpture, monumental architecture and mural painting of this era are unknown to us. By 1050 BC life in the Greek peninsula seems to have become sufficiently settled to allow a marked improvement in the production of earthenware. The style is confined to the rendering of circles, triangles, wavy lines and arcs, but placed with evident consideration and notable dexterity, probably aided by compass' and multiple brushes.[19] The site of Lefkandi is one of our most important sources of ceramics from this period where a cache of grave goods has been found giving evidence of a distinctive Euboian protogeometric style which lasted into the early 8th century.[20]\\r\\nGeometric art flourished in the 9th and 8th centuries BC. It was characterized by new motifs, breaking with the representation of the Minoan and Mycenaean periods: meanders, triangles and other geometrical decoration (hence the name of the style) as distinct from the predominantly circular figures of the previous style. However, our chronology for this new art form comes from exported wares found in datable contexts overseas.\\r\\nWith the early geometrical style (approximately 900ÿ850 BC) one finds only abstract motifs, in what is called the \\"Black Dipylon\\" style, which is characterized by an extensive use of black varnish, with the Middle Geometrical (approx. 850ÿ770 BC), figurative decoration makes its appearance: they are initially identical bands of animals such as horses, stags, goats, geese, etc. which alternate with the geometrical bands. In parallel, the decoration becomes complicated and becomes increasingly ornate; the painter feels reluctant to leave empty spaces and fills them with meanders or swastikas. This phase is named horror vacui (fear of the empty) and will not cease until the end of geometrical period.\\r\\nIn the middle of the century there begin to appear human figures, the best known representations of which are those of the vases found in Dipylon, one of the cemeteries of Athens. The fragments of these large funerary vases show mainly processions of chariots or warriors or of the funerary scenes: ?Ĳ? / prothesis (exposure and lamentation of dead) or ?ٶ? / ekphora (transport of the coffin to the cemetery). The bodies are represented in a geometrical way except for the calves, which are rather protuberant. In the case of soldiers, a shield in form of a diabolo, called dipylon shield because of its characteristic drawing, covers the central part of the body. The legs and the necks of the horses, the wheels of the chariots are represented one beside the other without perspective. The hand of this painter, so called in the absence of signature, is the Dipylon Master, could be identified on several pieces, in particular monumental amphorae.[22]\\r\\nAt the end of the period there appear representations of mythology, probably at the moment when Homer codifies the traditions of Trojan cycle in the Iliad and the Odyssey. Here however the interpretation constitutes a risk for the modern observer: a confrontation between two warriors can be a Homeric duel or simple combat; a failed boat can represent the shipwreck of Odysseus or any hapless sailor.\\r\\nLastly, are the local schools that appear in Greece. Production of vases was largely the prerogative of Athens ÿ it is well attested that as in the proto-geometrical period, in Corinth, Boeotia, Argos, Crete and Cyclades, the painters and potters were satisfied to follow the Attic style. From about the 8th century BC on, they created their own styles, Argos specializing in the figurative scenes, Crete remaining attached to a more strict abstraction.[23]\\r\\nThe orientalizing style was the product of cultural ferment in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean of the 8th and 7th centuries BC. Fostered by trade links with the city-states of Asia Minor, the artifacts of the East influenced a highly stylized yet recognizable representational art. Ivories, pottery and metalwork from the Neo-Hittite principalities of northern Syria and Phoenicia found their way to Greece, as did goods from Anatolian Urartu and Phrygia, yet there was little contact with the cultural centers of Egypt or Assyria. The new idiom developed initially in Corinth (as Proto-Corinthian) and later in Athens between 725 BC and 625 BC (as Proto-Attic).[24]\\r\\nIt was characterized by an expanded vocabulary of motifs: sphinx, griffin, lions, etc., as well as a repertory of non-mythological animals arranged in friezes across the belly of the vase. In these friezes, painters also began to apply lotuses or palmettes. Depictions of humans were relatively rare. Those that have been found are figures in silhouette with some incised detail, perhaps the origin of the incised silhouette figures of the black-figure period. There is sufficient detail on these figures to allow scholars to discern a number of different artists' hands. Geometrical features remained in the style called proto-Corinthian that embraced these orientalizing experiments, yet which coexisted with a conservative sub-geometric style.\\r\\nThe ceramics of Corinth were exported all over Greece, and their technique arrived in Athens, prompting the development of a less markedly Eastern idiom there. During this time described as Proto-Attic, the orientalizing motifs appear but the features remain not very realistic. The painters show a preference for the typical scenes of the Geometrical Period, like processions of chariots. However, they adopt the principle of line drawing to replace the silhouette. In the middle of 7th century BC, there appears the black and white style: black figures on a white zone, accompanied by polychromy to render the color of the flesh or clothing. Clay used in Athens was much more orange than that of Corinth, and so did not lend itself as easily to the representation of flesh. Attic Orientalising Painters include the Analatos Painter, the Mesogeia Painter and the Polyphemos Painter.\\r\\nCrete, and especially the islands of the Cyclades, are characterized by their attraction to the vases known as plastic, i.e. those whose paunch or collar is moulded in the shape of head of an animal or a man. At Aegina, the most popular form of the plastic vase is the head of the griffin. The Melanesian amphoras, manufactured at Paros, exhibit little knowledge of Corinthian developments. They present a marked taste for the epic composition and a horror vacui, which is expressed in an abundance of swastikas and meanders.\\r\\nFinally one can identify the last major style of the period, that of Wild Goat Style, allotted traditionally to Rhodes because of an important discovery within the necropolis of Kameiros. In fact, it is widespread over all of Asia Minor, with centers of production at Miletos and Chios. Two forms prevail oenochoes, which copied bronze models, and dishes, with or without feet. The decoration is organized in superimposed registers in which stylized animals, in particular of feral goats (from whence the name) pursue each other in friezes. Many decorative motifs (floral triangles, swastikas, etc.) fill the empty spaces.\\r\\nThe subject is dominated mostly by Attic vase painting. Attic production was the first to resume after the Greek Dark Age and influenced the rest of Greece, especially Boeotia, Corinth, the Cyclades (in particular Naxos) and the Ionian colonies in the east Aegean.[25] Production of vases was largely the prerogative of Athens ÿ it is well attested that in Corinth, Boeotia, Argos, Crete and Cyclades, the painters and potters were satisfied to follow the Attic style.\\r\\nBy the end of the Archaic period the styles of black-figure pottery, red-figure pottery and the white ground technique had become fully established and would continue in use during the era of Classical Greece, from the early 5th to late 4th centuries BC. Corinth was eclipsed by Athenian trends since Athens was the progenitor of both the red-figure and white ground styles.[9]\\r\\nBlack-figure is the most commonly imagined when one thinks about Greek pottery. It was a popular style in ancient Greece for many years. The black-figure period coincides approximately with the era designated by Winckelmann as the middle to late Archaic, from c. 620 to 480 BC. The technique of incising silhouetted figures with enlivening detail which we now call the black-figure method was, as we saw, a Corinthian invention of the 7th century[26] and spread from there to other city states and regions including Sparta,[27] Boeotia,[28] Euboea,[29] the east Greek islands[30] and Athens.\\r\\nThe Corinthian fabric, extensively studied by Humfry Payne[31] and Darrell Amyx,[32] can be traced though the parallel treatment of animal and human figures. The animal motifs have greater prominence on the vase and show the greatest experimentation in the early phase of Corinthian black-figure. As Corinthian artists gained in confidence in their rendering of the human figure the animal frieze declined in size relative to the human scene during the middle to late phase. By the mid-6th century BC, the quality of Corinthian ware had fallen away significantly to the extent that some Corinthian potters would disguise their pots with a red slip in imitation of superior Athenian ware.\\r\\nAt Athens researchers have found the earliest known examples of vase painters signing their work, the first being a dinos by Sophilos (illus. below, BM c. 580), this perhaps indicative of their increasing ambition as artists in producing the monumental work demanded as grave markers, as for example with Kleitias's Fran?ois Vase. Many scholars consider the finest work in the style to belong Exekias and the Amasis Painter, who are noted for their feeling for composition and narrative.\\r\\nCirca 520 BC the red-figure technique was developed and was gradually introduced in the form of the bilingual vase by the Andokides Painter, Oltos and Psiax.[33] Red-figure quickly eclipsed black-figure, yet in the unique form of the Panathanaic Amphora, black-figure continued to be utilised well into the 4th century BC.\\r\\nThe innovation of the red-figure technique was an Athenian invention of the late 6th century. It was quite the opposite of black-figure which had a red background. The ability to render detail by direct painting rather than incision offered new expressive possibilities to artists such as three-quarter profiles, greater anatomical detail and the representation of perspective.\\r\\nThe first generation of red-figure painters worked in both red- and black-figure as well as other methods including Six's technique and white-ground; the latter was developed at the same time as red-figure. However, within twenty years, experimentation had given way to specialization as seen in the vases of the Pioneer Group, whose figural work was exclusively in red-figure, though they retained the use of black-figure for some early floral ornamentation. The shared values and goals of The Pioneers such as Euphronios and Euthymides signal that they were something approaching a self-conscious movement, though they left behind no testament other than their own work. John Boardman said of the research on their work that \\"the reconstruction of their careers, common purpose, even rivalries, can be taken as an archaeological triumph\\"[34]\\r\\nThe next generation of late Archaic vase painters (c. 500 to 480 BC) brought an increasing naturalism to the style as seen in the gradual change of the profile eye. This phase also sees the specialization of painters into pot and cup painters, with the Berlin and Kleophrades Painters notable in the former category and Douris and Onesimos in the latter.\\r\\nBy the early to high classical era of red-figure painting (c. 480ÿ425 BC), a number of distinct schools had evolved. The mannerists associated with the workshop of Myson and exemplified by the Pan Painter hold to the archaic features of stiff drapery and awkward poses and combine that with exaggerated gestures. By contrast, the school of the Berlin Painter in the form of the Achilles Painter and his peers (who may have been the Berlin Painters pupils) favoured a naturalistic pose usually of a single figure against a solid black background or of restrained white-ground lekythoi. Polygnotos and the Kleophon Painter can be included in the school of the Niobid Painter, as their work indicates something of the influence of the Parthenon sculptures both in theme (e.g., Polygnotoss centauromachy, Brussels, Muses Royaux A. & Hist., A 134) and in feeling for composition.\\r\\nToward the end of the century, the \\"Rich\\" style of Attic sculpture as seen in the Nike Balustrade is reflected in contemporary vase painting with an ever-greater attention to incidental detail, such as hair and jewellery. The Meidias Painter is usually most closely identified with this style.\\r\\nVase production in Athens stopped around 330ÿ320 BC possibly due to Alexander the Great's control of the city, and had been in slow decline over the 4th century along with the political fortunes of Athens itself. However, vase production continued in the 4th and 3rd centuries in the Greek colonies of southern Italy where five regional styles may be distinguished. These are the Apulian, Lucanian, Sicilian, Campanian and Paestan. Red-figure work flourished there with the distinctive addition of polychromatic painting and in the case of the Black Sea colony of Panticapeum the gilded work of the Kerch Style. Several noteworthy artists' work comes down to us including the Darius Painter and the Underworld Painter, both active in the late 4th century, whose crowded polychromatic scenes often essay a complexity of emotion not attempted by earlier painters. Their work represents a late mannerist phase to the achievement of Greek vase painting.\\r\\nThe white-ground technique was developed at the end of the 6th century BC. Unlike the better-known black-figure and red-figure techniques, its coloration was not achieved through the application and firing of slips but through the use of paints and gilding on a surface of white clay. It allowed for a higher level of polychromy than the other techniques, although the vases end up less visually striking. The technique gained great importance during the 5th and 4th centuries, especially in the form of small lekythoi that became typical grave offerings. Important representatives include its inventor, the Achilles Painter, as well as Psiax, the Pistoxenos Painter, and the Thanatos Painter.\\r\\nRelief and plastic vases became particularly popular in the 4th century BC and continued being manufactured in the Hellenistic period. They were inspired by the so-called \\"rich style\\" developed mainly in Attica after 420 BC. The main features were the multi-figured compositions with use of added colours (pink/reddish, blue, green, gold)and an emphasis on female mythological figures. Theatre and performing constituted yet one more source of inspiration.\\r\\nDelphi Archaeological Museum has some particularly good examples of this style, including a vase with Aphrodite and Eros. The base is round, cylindrical, and its handle vertical, with bands, covered with black colour. The female figure (Aphrodite) is depicted seated, wearing an himation. Next to her stands a male figure, naked and winged. Both figures wear wreaths made of leaves and their hair preserve traces of golden paint. The features of their faces are stylized. The vase has a white ground and maintains in several parts the traces of bluish, greenish and reddish paint. It dates to the 4th century BC.\\r\\nIn the same room is kept a small lekythos with a plastic decoration, depicting a winged dancer. The figure wears a Persian head cover and an oriental dress, indicating that already in that period oriental dancers, possibly slaves, had become quite fashionable. The figure is also covered with a white colour. The total height of the vase is 18 centimeters and it dates to the 4th century BC.\\r\\nThe Hellenistic period, ushered in by the conquests of Alexander the Great, saw the virtual disappearance of black and red-figure pottery yet also the emergence of new styles such as West Slope Ware in the east, the Centuripe Ware in Sicily, and the Gnathia vases to the west.[35] Outside of mainland Greece other regional Greek traditions developed, such as those in Magna Graecia with the various styles in South Italy, including Apulian, Lucanian, Paestan, Campanian, and Sicilian.[9]\\r\\nInscriptions on Greek pottery are of two kinds; the incised (the earliest of which are contemporary with the beginnings of the Greek alphabet in the 8th century BC), and the painted, which only begin to appear a century later. Both forms are relatively common on painted vases until the Hellenistic period when the practice of inscribing pots seems to die out. They are by far most frequently found on Attic pottery.\\r\\nA number of sub-classes of inscription can be distinguished. Potters and painters occasionally signed their works with epoiesen and egraphsen respectively. Trademarks are found from the start of the 6th century on Corinthian pieces; these may have belonged to an exporting merchant rather than the pottery workfield and this remains a matter of conjecture.) Patrons' names are also sometimes recorded, as are the names of characters and objects depicted. At times we may find a snatch of dialogue to accompany a scene, as in Dysniketoss horse has won, announces a herald on a Panathenaic amphora (BM, B 144). More puzzling, however, are the kalos and kalee inscriptions, which might have formed part of courtship ritual in Athenian high society, yet are found on a wide variety of vases not necessarily associated with a social setting. Finally there are abecedaria and nonsense inscriptions, though these are largely confined to black-figure pots.[36]\\r\\nGreek terracotta figurines were another important type of pottery, initially mostly religious, but increasingly representing purely decorative subjects. Earlier figurines were usually votive offerings at temples.\\r\\nSeveral clay vases owed their inspiration to metal forms, which have not survived as much as clay due to being melted down. The alabastron's name suggests alabaster, stone.[37] The Derveni Krater, from near Thessaloniki, is a large bronze volute krater from about 320 BC, weighing 40 kilograms, and finely decorated with a 32-centimetre-tall frieze of figures in relief representing Dionysus surrounded by Ariadne and her procession of satyrs and maenads.\\r\\nGlass was also used, such as in Hellenistic glass.","input":"What types of designs were painted on early greek vases?"},{"output":"April 26, 1992","context":"MS Majesty of the Seas is a Sovereign-class cruise ship owned by Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd and operated by Royal Caribbean International.

The greatest increase in prevalence is, however, occurring in low- and middle-income countries[1] including in Asia and Africa, where most patients will probably be found by 2030.[3] The increase in incidence in developing countries follows the trend of urbanization and lifestyle changes, including increasingly sedentary lifestyles, less physically demanding work and the global nutrition transition, marked by increased intake of foods that are high energy-dense but nutrient-poor (often high in sugar and saturated fats, sometimes referred to as the Western pattern diet).[1][3] The risk of getting type 2 diabetes has been widely found to be associated with lower socio-economic position across countries.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe WHO estimates that diabetes resulted in 1.5 million deaths in 2012, making it the 8th leading cause of death.[1] However another 2.2 million deaths worldwide were attributable to high blood glucose and the increased risks of associated complications (e.g. heart disease, stroke, kidney failure), which often result in premature death and are often listed as the underlying cause on death certificates rather than diabetes.[1][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, Bangladesh, a developing country in South East Asia, was home to more than 5 million (prevalence adjusted to the national population ÿ 5.5%) diabetic patient, which will rise to more than 10 million (prevalence adjusted to the national population ÿ 8.2%) by 2035. \\r\\n[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost one Chinese adult in ten has diabetes. A 2010 study estimated that more than 92 million Chinese adults have the disease, with another 150 million showing early symptoms.[9] The incidence of the disease is increasing rapidly: a reported 30% increase in 7 years.[10] Indigenous nomadic peoples like Tibetans and Mongols are at much higher susceptibility than Han Chinese.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil recently, India had more diabetics than any other country in the world, according to the International Diabetes Foundation,[11] although the country has now been surpassed in the top spot by China.[9] Diabetes currently affects more than 62 million Indians, which is more than 7.1% of the adult population.[12]  The average age on onset is 42.5 years.[11] Nearly 1 million Indians die due to diabetes every year.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Indian Heart Association, India is projected to be home to 109 million individuals with diabetes by 2035.[13] A study by the American Diabetes Association reports that India will see the greatest increase in people diagnosed with diabetes by 2030.[14] The high incidence is attributed to a combination of genetic susceptibility plus adoption of a high-calorie, low-activity lifestyle by India's growing middle class.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 3.8?million people in the United Kingdom have diabetes mellitus, but the charity Diabetes U.K. have made predictions that could become high as 6.2?million by 2035/2036. The NHS spent a daily average of S2.2m (?2.6m; $3.7m) in 2013 on prescriptions for managing diabetes in primary care, and about 10% of the primary care prescribing budget is spent on treating diabetes.[16] Diabetes U.K. have also predicted that the National Health Service could be spending as much as 16.9?billion pounds on diabetes mellitus by 2035, a figure that means the NHS could be spending as much as 17% of its budget on diabetes treatment by 2035.[17][18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost 2.4 million Canadians (6.8%) have been diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, based on 2009 chronic disease surveillance data. Prevalence is higher among males (7.2%) than females (6.4%).[7] However these numbers are likely an underestimate, as data obtained from blood samples indicate about 20% of diabetes cases remain undiagnosed.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccounting for the younger age structure in Aboriginal populations, the prevalence of diabetes is 2-3 times higher among First Nations and Mtis, compared to the non-Aboriginal population.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among Canadians increased by 70% over the decade from 1999 to 2009.[7] The greatest relative increase in prevalence was seen younger adults (35 to 44 years), attributable in part to increasing rates of overweight and obesity. The Public Health Agency of Canada estimates that if current trends in diabetes continue, the number of Canadians living with diabetes will reach 3.7 million by 2019.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nDiabetes rates in the United States, like across North America and around the world, have been increasing substantially. According to the 2014 Statistics Report done by the CDC it was found that, Diabetes Mellitus affects an estimated 29.1 million people in the United States and is the 7th leading cause of death. It also increases the chances of mortality, as well as the risk for heart attack, kidney failure, and blindness[21] While the number of people with diabetes in the US continues to grow, the number of new cases has been declining since 2009, after decades of increases in new cases.[22] In 2014, more than 29 million people had diabetes in the United States, of whom 7?million people remain undiagnosed.[23] As of 2012 another 57?million people were estimated to have prediabetes.[24][25]  There were approximately 12.1 million diabetes-related emergency department (ED) visits in 2010 for adults aged 18 years or older (515 per 10,000 U.S. population), accounting for 9.4 percent of all ED visits.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has called the change an epidemic.[27] \\r\\nGeographically, there is a U.S. diabetes belt with high diabetes prevalence estimates, which includes Mississippi and parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.[28] \\r\\nThe National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse estimates diabetes costs $132?billion in the United States alone every year. About 5%ÿ10% of diabetes cases in North America are type?1, with the rest being type?2. The fraction of type?1 in other parts of the world differs. Most of this difference is not currently understood. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) cites the 2003 assessment of the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) that one in three Americans born after 2000 will develop diabetes in their lifetimes.[29][30] Diabetes is also more prominent in minority groups. For example according to the American Diabetes Association the rates of diagnosed diabetes are 12.8% of Hispanics, 13.2% of Non-Hispanic blacks, 15.9% of American Indians/Alaskan Natives. While Non-Hispanic whites are 7.6% and only 9% of Asian Americans have diagnosed diabetes.[31] 4.9% of American adults had diabetes in 1990. By 1998, that number rose by a third to 6.5%. The prevalence of diabetes increased for both sexes and every racial group. American women have suffered from diabetes at a higher rate than men, with 7.4% of women being diabetic in 1998, as opposed to only 5.5% of men. The increase in diabetes coincides with an increase in average weight across both genders. In the same time frame, average weight in both men and women increased by nearly 4 kilograms. This relates to the fact that the most common form of diabetes, type 2, is strongly associated with unhealthy weight. Older Americans have suffered from diabetes at a much higher rate than younger people, with over 12% of those in their 60s and 70s being diabetic in 1998. In the same year, less than 2% of those under 30 suffered from diabetes. Weight is also a strong factor in one's likelihood of becoming diabetic, with 13.5% of obese Americans in 1998 being diabetic. In the same year, only 3.5% of people at a healthy weight had the disease.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2006, about 18.3% (8.6?million) of Americans age 60 and older had diabetes, according to the ADA.[33] Diabetes mellitus prevalence increases with age, and the numbers of older persons with diabetes are expected to grow as the elderly population increases in number. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) from 1988ÿ1994 demonstrated, in the population over 65 years old, 18% to 20% had diabetes, with 40% having either diabetes or its precursor form of impaired glucose tolerance.[34]  Older individuals are also more likely to be seen in the emergency department (ED) for diabetes.  A study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that in 2010, diabetes-related ED visit rates were highest for patients aged 65 and older (1,307 per 10,000 population), compared with 45- to 64-year-olds (584 per 10,000 population) and 18- to 44-year-olds (183 per 10,000 population).[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nA second study by AHRQ found that diabetes with complications was one of the twenty most expensive conditions seen in U.S. inpatient hospitalizations in 2011, with an aggregate cost of nearly $5.4 billion for 561,000 stays.  It was among the top five most expensive conditions for uninsured patients, at an aggregate cost of $440 million for 62,000 hospitalizations.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn estimated 700,000 Australians have diabetes.[5] Indigenous populations in developed countries generally have higher prevalence and incidence of diabetes than their corresponding nonindigenous populations. In Australia, the age-standardised prevalence of self-reported diabetes in indigenous Australians is almost four times that of nonindigenous Australians.[36] Reasons include higher rates of obesity, physical inactivity, and living in poor housing and environments among Indigenous peoples.[5] \\r\\nPreventative community health programs are showing some success in tackling this problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates that 14.2 million are living with diabetes in Africa.[37] The region of Africa has the highest percentage of undiagnosed diabetes cases reaching 66.7%, highest proportion of diabetes mellitus related mortality and the lowest health expenditure spent on diabetes.[37]","input":"What is the percentage of diabetes in india?"},{"output":"maximum sentence of one year of imprisonment,","context":"A misdemeanor (American English,[1] spelled misdemeanour in British English) is any \\"lesser\\" criminal act in some common law legal systems. Misdemeanors are generally punished less severely than felonies, but theoretically more so than administrative infractions (also known as minor, petty, or summary offences) and regulatory offences. Many misdemeanors are punished with monetary fines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA misdemeanor is considered a crime of low seriousness, and a felony one of high seriousness.[2] A principle of the rationale for the degree of punishment meted out is that the punishment should fit the crime.[3][4][5] One standard for measurement is the degree to which a crime affects others or society. Measurements of the degree of seriousness of a crime have been developed.[6]\\r\\nIn the United States, the federal government generally considers a crime punishable with incarceration for one year or less to be a misdemeanor. All other crimes are considered felonies.[7] Many states also employ the same or a similar distinction.[8]\\r\\nThe distinction between felonies and misdemeanors has been abolished by several common law jurisdictions (e.g. Australia[9]). These jurisdictions have generally adopted some other classification: in the Commonwealth nations of Australia,[10] Canada,[11] New Zealand,[12] and the United Kingdom,[13][14] the crimes are divided into summary offences and indictable offences.[15] The Republic of Ireland, a former member of the Commonwealth, also uses these divisions.[16]\\r\\nIn the United States of America, even if a criminal charge for the defendant's conduct is normally a misdemeanor, sometimes a repeat offender will be charged with a felony offense. For example, the first time a person commits certain crimes, such as spousal assault, it is normally a misdemeanor, but the second time it may become a felony.[17]\\r\\nIn some jurisdictions, those who are convicted of a misdemeanor are known as misdemeanants (as contrasted with those convicted of a felony who are known as felons). Depending on the jurisdiction, examples of misdemeanors may include: petty theft, prostitution, public intoxication, simple assault, disorderly conduct, trespass, vandalism, reckless driving, discharging a firearm within city limits, possession of cannabis and in some jurisdictions first-time possession of certain other drugs, and other similar crimes.\\r\\nMisdemeanors usually do not result in the loss of civil rights, but may result in loss of privileges, such as professional licenses, public offices, or public employment. Such effects are known as the collateral consequences of criminal charges. This is more common when the misdemeanor is related to the privilege in question (such as the loss of a taxi driver's license after a conviction for reckless driving), or when the misdemeanor involves moral turpitudeand in general is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\\r\\nIn the United States, misdemeanors are typically crimes with a maximum punishment of 12 months of incarceration, typically in a local jail as contrasted with felons, who are typically incarcerated in a prison. Jurisdictions such as Massachusetts are a notable exception where the maximum punishment of some misdemeanors is up to 2.5 years.[18] People who are convicted of misdemeanors are often punished with probation, community service, short jail term, or part-time incarceration such as a sentence that may be served on the weekends.\\r\\nThe United States Constitution provides that the President may be impeached and subsequently removed from office if found guilty by Congress for \\"high crimes and misdemeanors\\". As used in the Constitution, the term misdemeanor refers broadly to criminal acts as opposed to employing the felony-misdemeanor distinction used in modern criminal codes.[19] The definition of what constitutes a \\"high crime\\" or \\"misdemeanor\\" for purposes of impeachment is left to the judgment of Congress.[20]\\r\\nIn Singapore, misdemeanors generally are sentenced to months[clarification needed] of jail sentence but with individual crimes[clarification needed] suspects are sentenced to a harsher sentence. The penalty of vandalism is a fine not exceeding S$2,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years, and also corporal punishment of not less than three strokes and not more than eight strokes of the cane.\\r\\nDepending on the jurisdiction, several classes of misdemeanors may exist; the forms of punishment can vary widely between those classes. For example, the federal and state governments in the United States divide misdemeanors into several classes, with certain classes punishable by jail time and others carrying only a fine.[21] In New York law, a Class A Misdemeanor carries a maximum sentence of one year of imprisonment, while a Class B Misdemeanor \\"shall not exceed three months\\".[22]\\r\\nIn the United States, when a statute does not specify the class of a misdemeanor, it may be referred to as an unclassified misdemeanor.[2] Legislators usually enact such laws when they wish to impose penalties that fall outside the framework specified by each class.[citation needed] For example, Virginia has four classes of misdemeanors, with Class 1 and Class 2 misdemeanors being punishable by twelve-month and six-month jail sentences, respectively, and Class 3 and Class 4 misdemeanors being non-jail offenses payable by fines.[23] First-time cannabis possession is an unclassified misdemeanor in Virginia punishable by up to 30 days in jail rather than the normal fines and jail sentences of the four classes.[23][24] New York has three classes of misdemeanor: A, B, and Unclassified.[25]\\r\\nAll distinctions between felony and misdemeanour were abolished by section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1967. Prior to this, a person prosecuted for misdemeanour was called a defendant.[26]","input":"How much jail time for class a misdemeanor?"},{"output":"as a response to issues that arose during the French and Indian War","context":"Quartering Act is a name given to a minimum of two Acts of British Parliament in the local governments of the American colonies to provide the British soldiers with any needed accommodations and housing. It also required colonists to provide food for any British soldiers in the area. Each of the Quartering Acts was an amendment to the Mutiny Act and required annual renewal by Parliament.[1] They were originally intended as a response to issues that arose during the French and Indian War and soon became a source of tension between the inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies and the government in London, England. These tensions would later fuel the fire that led to the American Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Thomas Gage, commander-in-chief of forces in British North America, and other British officers who had fought in the French and Indian War, had found it hard to persuade colonial assemblies to pay for quartering and provisioning of troops on the march. Therefore, he asked Parliament to do something. Most colonies had supplied provisions during the war, but the issue was disputed in peacetime. The Province of New York was their headquarters, because the assembly had passed an Act to provide for the quartering of British regulars, but it expired on January 2, 1764,[2] The result was the Quartering Act of 1765, which went far beyond what Gage had requested. No standing army had been kept in the colonies before the French and Indian War, so the colonies asked why a standing army was needed after the French had been defeated in battle.\\r\\nThis first Quartering Act[3] was given Royal Assent on May 15, 1765,[4] and provided that Great Britain would house its soldiers in American barracks and public houses, as by the Mutiny Act of 1765, but if its soldiers outnumbered the housing available, would quarter them in \\"inns, livery stables, ale houses, victualing houses, and the houses of sellers of wine and houses of persons selling of rum, brandy, strong water, cider or metheglin\\", and if numbers required in \\"uninhabited houses, outhouses, barns, or other buildings.\\" Colonial authorities were required to pay the cost of housing and feeding these troops.\\r\\nWhen 1,500 British troops arrived at New York City in 1766 the New York Provincial Assembly refused to comply with the Quartering Act and did not supply billeting for the troops. The troops had to remain on their ships. With its great impact on the city, a skirmish occurred in which one colonist was wounded following the Assembly's refusal to provide quartering. For failure to comply with the Quartering Act, Parliament suspended the Province of New York's Governor and legislature in 1767 and 1769, but never carried it out, since the Assembly soon agreed to contribute money toward the quartering of troops;[5] the New York Assembly allocated funds for the quartering of British troops in 1771. The Quartering Act was circumvented in all colonies other than Pennsylvania.\\r\\nThis act expired on March 24, 1776.\\r\\nThe Quartering Act of 1774 was known as one of the Coercive Acts in Great Britain, and as part of the intolerable acts in the colonies. This act applied to all colonies and stated that the British troops could live and eat in colonial homes without the owners' permission.\\r\\nDuring the French and Indian War Britain had forcibly seized quarters in private dwellings.[6] In the American Revolutionary War, the New York Provincial Congress barracked Continental Army troops in private homes.[7] The Americans strongly opposed the quartering of British troops in their homes because the British Parliament had created the Mutiny Act under which the British army was supposed to be prohibited against quartering troops in private homes of citizens against their will. Although Parliament passed these laws in 1723, 1754, and 1756 the British Army ignored them in the Colonies. Because of this violation of their rights the colonies believed that liberty itself would be destroyed. Along with the fear of a loss of liberty, the colonists felt that the British army should be subordinate to civil authority since Parliament already stated that the army couldnt force quartering through the Mutiny Act.[8]\\r\\nWith the growing worries of illegal quartering by the British, the Pennsylvania Assembly met and denied any quartering bill that guaranteed citizens could deny soldiers to stay in private homes. When the Assembly finally passed the quartering bill, the passage stating how soldiers could or could not be quartered in homes was omitted and it only outlined how the soldiers were to be quartered in public houses. That winters harsh conditions led the British commander, Col. Henry Bouquet, to order the colonists to quarter his troops in other places than just private homes. Bouquet felt his troops couldnt survive the winter without better living conditions. Bouquet wrote a letter to the governor of Pennsylvania telling him to issue a warrant to allow the quartering of his troops in private homes. The governor issued the warrant but left it blank instead of directly listing what Col. Bouquet could or could not do. The Pennsylvania Assembly was outraged when they learned what their governor had done. But instead of asking for a veto on the warrant they asked for a review on how many troops could be quartered in a single home at a time. But the only response they received was that the kings troops must and will be quartered. In response to this the Assembly met on a Sunday for the first time. There they wrote a letter to the governor asking why their constitutional rights were being violated when The British Parliament laws favored the colonists.[9]\\r\\nIn response to what was happening to the colonists, Benjamin Franklin opened up an Assembly meeting suggesting that soldiers could be quartered in public houses in the suburbs. This meant instead of the troops be directly in the city they would be in houses on the outskirts of the city on farms where they could potentially have more space. Governor Denny attended this Pennsylvania meeting and bluntly answered that the commander in chief had requested quartering for the troops in Philadelphia and if anybody had a problem with this then they should talk to Lord Loudoun. The committeemen brought to light that they felt Denny was siding with the British military when instead as governor he should work to protect the rights of the colonists. The ongoing quarrel between State Assembly, governor, and Lord Loudoun wasnt a dispute between legislature and executive powers; but a contest for political liberty. The colonists had the same rights through British Parliament laws but they were not granted to them and instead threatened by bayonets for personal gain.[9]\\r\\nIn Albany, New York the mayor had allocated $1,000 for the building of barracks for Loudouns troops, but the barracks had not been built by the time the troops arrived. The mayor told Loudoun that he knew his rights and refused to let the troops be quartered in Albany. When the mayor stayed adamant on his beliefs of not allowing the troops to be quartered, Loudoun had them forcefully apply themselves in private homes.[9]\\r\\nIn an early August committee meeting in Boston, Massachusetts, the governor was able to get the committee to pass a bill to grant money for the building of barracks. These barracks would accommodate up to one thousand troops. The barracks were built and all that had to be done was convince Loudoun to obey the procedures set by parliament. Everything went smoothly until two recruiting officers complained to governor Pawnall of Massachusetts that they were denied quarters in Boston. The response was that it was illegal to quarter in private homes in Boston and the committeemen suggested that they stay at the newly built barracks at Castle William. The timing of this new meeting with Lord Loudoun was extremely unfortunate. He was currently suffering losses in northern New York while trying to hold off the French and Indians. When he heard of what happened with the committeemen he argued that the current military crisis made it acceptable to quarter troops in private homes. A bill was then brought to the governor to sign that said troops could be quartered in homes but innkeepers had the right to complain to a judge if they felt too many soldiers were there. Loudon was enraged with this and threatened to force troops upon civilians again. By the end of December, the Massachusetts legislature was able to get Loudoun to agree to quarter his troops at Castle William, which meant through the long process the colonists, were able to uphold their legal rights.[10]\\r\\nOn May 3, 1765 the British Parliament met and finally passed a Quartering Act for the Americans. The act stated that troops could only be quartered in barracks and if there wasnt enough space in barracks then they were to be quartered in public houses and inns. If still not enough space then the governor and council were to find vacant space, but at no time was it legal to quarter troops in private homes.[11]\\r\\nA section of the United States Declaration of Independence listing the colonies' grievances against the King explicitly notes:\\r\\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\\r\\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us.\\r\\nThe Third Amendment to the United States Constitution, expressly prohibited the military from peacetime quartering of troops without consent of the owner of the house. A product of their times, the relevance of the Acts and the Third Amendment has greatly declined since the era of the American Revolution, having been the subject of only one case in over 200 years,[citation needed] Engblom v. Carey in 1982.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Quartering Act was one of the reasons for the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution[citation needed], which prohibits infringing on the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Standing armies were mistrusted, and the First Congress considered quartering of troops to have been one of the tools of oppression before and during the American revolution.[citation needed]","input":"Why were british troops stationed in the colonies?"},{"output":"28 June 2007","context":"The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is one of the 20th century's most famous and distinctive buildings.[3]\\r\\nDesigned by Danish architect J?rn Utzon, the building was formally opened on 20 October 1973[4] after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.[5]\\r\\nThe building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove, adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, and close by the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\\r\\nThough its name suggests a single venue, the building comprises multiple performance venues which together host well over 1,500 performances annually, attended by more than 1.2?million people.[6] Performances are presented by numerous performing artists, including three resident companies: Opera Australia, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia, more than eight million people visit the site annually, and approximately 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year.[7] The building is managed by the Sydney Opera House Trust, an agency of the New South Wales State Government.\\r\\nOn 28 June 2007, the Sydney Opera House became a UNESCO World Heritage Site;[8] having been listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate since 1980, the National Trust of Australia register since 1983, the City of Sydney Heritage Inventory since 2000, the New South Wales State Heritage Register since 2003, and the Australian National Heritage List since 2005.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe facility features a modern expressionist design, with a series of large precast concrete \\"shells\\",[11] each composed of sections of a sphere of 75.2 metres (246?ft 8.6?in) radius,[12] forming the roofs of the structure, set on a monumental podium. The building covers 1.8 hectares (4.4 acres) of land and is 183?m (600?ft) long and 120?m (394?ft) wide at its widest point. It is supported on 588 concrete piers sunk as much as 25?m (82?ft) below sea level.\\r\\nAlthough the roof structures are commonly referred to as \\"shells\\" (as in this article), they are precast concrete panels supported by precast concrete ribs, not shells in a strictly structural sense.[13] Though the shells appear uniformly white from a distance, they actually feature a subtle chevron pattern composed of 1,056,006 tiles in two colours: glossy white and matte cream. The tiles were manufactured by the Swedish company H?gan?s AB which generally produced stoneware tiles for the paper-mill industry.[14]\\r\\nApart from the tile of the shells and the glass curtain walls of the foyer spaces, the building's exterior is largely clad with aggregate panels composed of pink granite quarried at Tarana. Significant interior surface treatments also include off-form concrete, Australian white birch plywood supplied from Wauchope in northern New South Wales, and brush box glulam.[15]\\r\\nOf the two larger spaces, the Concert Hall is in the western group of shells, the Joan Sutherland Theatre in the eastern group. The scale of the shells was chosen to reflect the internal height requirements, with low entrance spaces, rising over the seating areas up to the high stage towers. The smaller venues (the Drama Theatre, the Playhouse and the Studio) are within the podium, beneath the Concert Hall. A smaller group of shells set to the western side of the Monumental Steps houses the Bennelong Restaurant. The podium is surrounded by substantial open public spaces, and the large stone-paved forecourt area with the adjacent monumental steps is regularly used as a performance space.\\r\\nThe Sydney Opera House includes a number of performance venues:[16]\\r\\nOther areas (for example the northern and western foyers) are also used for performances on an occasional basis. Venues are also used for conferences, ceremonies and social functions.\\r\\nThe building also houses a recording studio, cafes, restaurants, bars and retail outlets. Guided tours are available, including a frequent tour of the front-of-house spaces, and a daily backstage tour that takes visitors backstage to see areas normally reserved for performers and crew members.\\r\\nPlanning began in the late 1940s, when Eugene Goossens, the Director of the NSW State Conservatorium of Music, lobbied for a suitable venue for large theatrical productions. The normal venue for such productions, the Sydney Town Hall, was not considered large enough. By 1954, Goossens succeeded in gaining the support of NSW Premier Joseph Cahill, who called for designs for a dedicated opera house. It was also Goossens who insisted that Bennelong Point be the site: Cahill had wanted it to be on or near Wynyard Railway Station in the northwest of the CBD.[21]\\r\\nAn international design competition was launched by Cahill on 13 September 1955 and received 233 entries, representing architects from 32 countries. The criteria specified a large hall seating 3,000 and a small hall for 1,200 people, each to be designed for different uses, including full-scale operas, orchestral and choral concerts, mass meetings, lectures, ballet performances and other presentations.[22]\\r\\nThe winner, announced in 1957, was J?rn Utzon, a Danish architect. According to legend the Utzon design was rescued from a final cut of 30 \\"rejects\\" by the noted Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen. The runner-up was an entry by Philadelphia firm GBQC. The prize was S5,000.[23] Utzon visited Sydney in 1957 to help supervise the project.[24] His office moved to Palm Beach, Sydney in February 1963.[25]\\r\\nUtzon received the Pritzker Architecture Prize, architecture's highest honour, in 2003.[26] The Pritzker Prize citation read:\\r\\nThere is no doubt that the Sydney Opera House is his masterpiece. It is one of the great iconic buildings of the 20th century, an image of great beauty that has become known throughout the world ÿ a symbol for not only a city, but a whole country and continent.\\r\\nThe Fort Macquarie Tram Depot, occupying the site at the time of these plans, was demolished in 1958 and construction began in March 1959. It was built in three stages: stage I (1959ÿ1963) consisted of building the upper podium; stage II (1963ÿ1967) the construction of the outer shells; stage III (1967ÿ1973) interior design and construction.\\r\\nStage I commenced on 2 March 1959 with the construction firm Civil & Civic, monitored by the engineers Ove Arup and Partners.[27] The government had pushed for work to begin early, fearing that funding, or public opinion, might turn against them. However, Utzon had still not completed the final designs. Major structural issues still remained unresolved. By 23 January 1961, work was running 47 weeks behind,[27] mainly because of unexpected difficulties (inclement weather, unexpected difficulty diverting stormwater, construction beginning before proper construction drawings had been prepared, changes of original contract documents). Work on the podium was finally completed in February 1963. The forced early start led to significant later problems, not least of which was the fact that the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof structure, and had to be re-built.[28]\\r\\nThe shells of the competition entry were originally of undefined geometry,[29] but, early in the design process, the \\"shells\\" were perceived as a series of parabolas supported by precast concrete ribs. However, engineers Ove Arup and Partners were unable to find an acceptable solution to constructing them. The formwork for using in-situ concrete would have been prohibitively expensive, and, because there was no repetition in any of the roof forms, the construction of precast concrete for each individual section would possibly have been even more expensive.\\r\\nFrom 1957 to 1963, the design team went through at least 12 iterations of the form of the shells trying to find an economically acceptable form (including schemes with parabolas, circular ribs and ellipsoids) before a workable solution was completed. The design work on the shells involved one of the earliest uses of computers in structural analysis, to understand the complex forces to which the shells would be subjected.[30] The computer system was also used in the assembly of the arches. The pins in the arches were surveyed at the end of each day, and the information was entered into the computer so the next arch could be properly placed the following day. In mid-1961, the design team found a solution to the problem: the shells all being created as sections from a sphere. This solution allows arches of varying length to be cast in a common mould, and a number of arch segments of common length to be placed adjacent to one another, to form a spherical section. With whom exactly this solution originated has been the subject of some controversy. It was originally credited to Utzon. Ove Arup's letter to Ashworth, a member of the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee, states: \\"Utzon came up with an idea of making all the shells of uniform curvature throughout in both directions.\\"[31] Peter Jones, the author of Ove Arup's biography, states that \\"the architect and his supporters alike claimed to recall the precise eureka moment ...?; the engineers and some of their associates, with equal conviction, recall discussion in both central London and at Ove's house.\\"\\r\\nHe goes on to claim that \\"the existing evidence shows that Arup's canvassed several possibilities for the geometry of the shells, from parabolas to ellipsoids and spheres.\\"[30] Yuzo Mikami, a member of the design team, presents an opposite view in his book on the project, Utzon's Sphere.[32][33] It is unlikely that the truth will ever be categorically known, but there is a clear consensus that the design team worked very well indeed for the first part of the project and that Utzon, Arup, and Ronald Jenkins (partner of Ove Arup and Partners responsible for the Opera House project) all played a very significant part in the design development.[34]\\r\\nAs Peter Murray states in The Saga of the Sydney Opera House:[28]\\r\\n... the two menand their teamsenjoyed a collaboration that was remarkable in its fruitfulness and, despite many traumas, was seen by most of those involved in the project as a high point of architect/engineer collaboration.\\r\\nThe design of the roof was tested on scale models in wind tunnels at University of Southampton and later NPL in order to establish the wind-pressure distribution around the roof shape in very high winds, which helped in the design of the roof tiles and their fixtures.[35][36]\\r\\nThe shells were constructed by Hornibrook Group Pty Ltd,[37] who were also responsible for construction in Stage III. Hornibrook manufactured the 2400 precast ribs and 4000 roof panels in an on-site factory and also developed the construction processes.[28] The achievement of this solution avoided the need for expensive formwork construction by allowing the use of precast units (it also allowed the roof tiles to be prefabricated in sheets on the ground, instead of being stuck on individually at height). Ove Arup and Partners' site engineer supervised the construction of the shells, which used an innovative adjustable steel-trussed \\"erection arch\\" to support the different roofs before completion. On 6 April 1962, it was estimated that the Opera House would be completed between August 1964 and March 1965.\\r\\nStage III, the interiors, started with Utzon moving his entire office to Sydney in February 1963. However, there was a change of government in 1965, and the new Robert Askin government declared the project under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works. Due to the Ministry's criticism of the project's costs and time,[38] along with their impression of Utzon's designs being impractical, this ultimately led to his resignation in 1966 (see below).\\r\\nThe cost of the project so far, even in October 1966, was still only $22.9?million,[39] less than a quarter of the final $102?million cost. However, the projected costs for the design were at this stage much more significant.\\r\\nThe second stage of construction was progressing toward completion when Utzon resigned. His position was principally taken over by Peter Hall, who became largely responsible for the interior design. Other persons appointed that same year to replace Utzon were E. H. Farmer as government architect, D. S. Littlemore and Lionel Todd.\\r\\nFollowing Utzon's resignation, the acoustic advisor, Lothar Cremer, confirmed to the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC) that Utzon's original acoustic design allowed for only 2000 seats in the main hall and further stated that increasing the number of seats to 3000 as specified in the brief would be disastrous for the acoustics. According to Peter Jones, the stage designer, Martin Carr, criticised the \\"shape, height and width of the stage, the physical facilities for artists, the location of the dressing rooms, the widths of doors and lifts, and the location of lighting switchboards.\\"[40]\\r\\nThe Opera House was formally completed in 1973, having cost $102?million.[43] H.R. \\"Sam\\" Hoare, the Hornibrook director in charge of the project, provided the following approximations in 1973: Stage I: podium Civil & Civic Pty Ltd approximately $5.5m. Stage II: roof shells M.R. Hornibrook (NSW) Pty Ltd approximately $12.5m. Stage III: completion The Hornibrook Group $56.5m. Separate contracts: stage equipment, stage lighting and organ $9.0m. Fees and other costs: $16.5m.\\r\\nThe original cost and scheduling estimates in 1957 projected a cost of S3,500,000 ($7?million) and completion date of 26 January 1963 (Australia Day).[30] In reality, the project was completed ten years late and 1,357% over budget in real terms.\\r\\nBefore the Sydney Opera House competition, J?rn Utzon had won seven of the 18 competitions he had entered but had never seen any of his designs built.[44] Utzon's submitted concept for the Sydney Opera House was almost universally admired and considered groundbreaking. The Assessors Report of January 1957, stated:\\r\\nThe drawings submitted for this scheme are simple to the point of being diagrammatic. Nevertheless, as we have returned again and again to the study of these drawings, we are convinced that they present a concept of an Opera House which is capable of becoming one of the great buildings of the world.\\r\\nFor the first stage, Utzon worked successfully with the rest of the design team and the client, but, as the project progressed, the Cahill government insisted on progressive revisions. They also did not fully appreciate the costs or work involved in design and construction. Tensions between the client and the design team grew further when an early start to construction was demanded despite an incomplete design. This resulted in a continuing series of delays and setbacks while various technical engineering issues were being refined. The building was unique, and the problems with the design issues and cost increases were exacerbated by commencement of work before the completion of the final plans.\\r\\nAfter the 1965 election of the Liberal Party, with Robert Askin becoming Premier of New South Wales, the relationship of client, architect, engineers and contractors became increasingly tense. Askin had been a \\"vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office.\\"[45] His new Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, was even less sympathetic. Elizabeth Farrelly, an Australian architecture critic, wrote that:\\r\\nat an election night dinner party in Mosman, Hughes' daughter Sue Burgoyne boasted that her father would soon sack Utzon. Hughes had no interest in art, architecture or aesthetics. A fraud, as well as a philistine, he had been exposed before Parliament and dumped as Country Party leader for 19 years of falsely claiming a university degree. The Opera House gave Hughes a second chance. For him, as for Utzon, it was all about control; about the triumph of homegrown mediocrity over foreign genius.[45]\\r\\nDifferences ensued. One of the first was that Utzon believed the clients should receive information on all aspects of the design and construction through his practice, while the clients wanted a system (notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes) where architect, contractors, and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately. This had great implications for procurement methods and cost control, with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers (such as Ralph Symonds for the plywood interiors) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be put out to tender.[28]\\r\\nUtzon was highly reluctant to respond to questions or criticism from the client's Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC).[46] However, he was greatly supported throughout by a member of the committee and one of the original competition judges, Harry Ingham Ashworth. Utzon was unwilling to compromise on some aspects of his designs that the clients wanted to change.\\r\\nUtzon's ability was never in doubt, despite questions raised by Davis Hughes, who attempted to portray Utzon as an impractical dreamer. Ove Arup actually stated that Utzon was \\"probably the best of any I have come across in my long experience of working with architects\\"[47] and: \\"The Opera House could become the world's foremost contemporary masterpiece if Utzon is given his head.\\"\\r\\nIn October 1965, Utzon gave Hughes a schedule setting out the completion dates of parts of his work for stage III.[citation needed] Utzon was at this time working closely with Ralph Symonds, a manufacturer of plywood based in Sydney and highly regarded by many, despite an Arup engineer warning that Ralph Symonds's \\"knowledge of the design stresses of plywood, was extremely sketchy\\" and that the technical advice was \\"elementary to say the least and completely useless for our purposes.\\" Australian architecture critic Elizabeth Farrelly has referred to Ove Arup's project engineer Michael Lewis as having \\"other agendas\\".[45] In any case, Hughes shortly after withheld permission for the construction of plywood prototypes for the interiors,[citation needed] and the relationship between Utzon and the client never recovered. By February 1966, Utzon was owed more than $100,000 in fees.[48] Hughes then withheld funding so that Utzon could not even pay his own staff. The government minutes record that following several threats of resignation, Utzon finally stated to Davis Hughes: \\"If you don't do it, I resign.\\" Hughes replied: \\"I accept your resignation. Thank you very much. Goodbye.\\"[49]\\r\\nUtzon left the project on 28 February 1966. He said that Hughes's refusal to pay him any fees and the lack of collaboration caused his resignation and later famously described the situation as \\"Malice in Blunderland\\". In March 1966, Hughes offered him a subordinate role as \\"design architect\\" under a panel of executive architects, without any supervisory powers over the House's construction, but Utzon rejected this. Utzon left the country never to return.\\r\\nFollowing the resignation, there was great controversy about who was in the right and who was in the wrong. The Sydney Morning Herald initially opined: \\"No architect in the world has enjoyed greater freedom than Mr Utzon. Few clients have been more patient or more generous than the people and the Government of NSW. One would not like history to record that this partnership was brought to an end by a fit of temper on the one side or by a fit of meanness on the other.\\" On 17 March 1966, the Herald offered the view that:[50] \\"It was not his [Utzon's] fault that a succession of Governments and the Opera House Trust should so signally have failed to impose any control or order on the project .... his concept was so daring that he himself could solve its problems only step by step .... his insistence on perfection led him to alter his design as he went along.\\"\\r\\nThe Sydney Opera House opened the way for the immensely complex geometries of some modern architecture. The design was one of the first examples of the use of computer-aided design to design complex shapes. The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture, such as works of Gehry and blobitecture, as well as most reinforced concrete structures. The design is also one of the first in the world to use araldite to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use.\\r\\nIt was also a first in mechanical engineering. Another Danish firm, Steensen Varming, was responsible for designing the new air-conditioning plant, the largest in Australia at the time, supplying over 600,000 cubic feet (17,000?m3) of air per minute,[51] using the innovative idea of harnessing the harbour water to create a water-cooled heat pump system that is still in operation today.[52]\\r\\nAfter the resignation of Utzon, the Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, and the Government Architect, Ted Farmer, organised a team to bring the Sydney Opera House to completion. The architectural work was divided between three appointees who became the Hall, Todd, Littlemore partnership. David Littlemore would manage construction supervision, Lionel Todd contract documentation, while the crucial role of design became the responsibility of Peter Hall.[53]:page:45\\r\\nPeter Hall (1931ÿ1995) completed a combined arts and architecture degree at Sydney University. Upon graduation a travel scholarship enabled him to spend twelve months in Europe during which time he visited Utzon in Helleb?k.[54] Returning to Sydney, Hall worked for the Government Architect, a branch of the NSW Public Works Department. While there he established himself as a talented design architect with a number of court and university buildings, including the Goldstein Hall at the University of New South Wales, which won the Sir John Sulman Medal in 1964.\\r\\nHall resigned from the Government Architects office in early 1966 to pursue his own practice. When approached to take on the design role, (after at least two prominent Sydney architects had declined), Hall spoke with Utzon by phone before accepting the position. Utzon reportedly told Hall: he (Hall) would not be able to finish the job and the Government would have to invite him back.[53](p46) Hall also sought the advice of others, including architect Don Gazzard who warned him acceptance would be a bad career move as the project would \\"never be his own\\".[53]:page:47\\r\\nHall agreed to accept the role on the condition there was no possibility of Utzon returning. Even so, his appointment did not go down well with many of his fellow architects who considered that no one but Utzon should complete the Sydney Opera House.[54] Upon Utzon's dismissal, a rally of protest had marched to Bennelong Point. A petition was also circulated, including in the Government Architects office. Peter Hall was one of the many who had signed the petition that called for Utzon's reinstatement.[54]\\r\\nWhen Hall agreed to the design role and was appointed in April 1966, he imagined he would find the design and documentation for the Stage III well advanced. What he found was an enormous amount of work ahead of him with many aspects completely unresolved by Utzon in relation to seating capacity, acoustics and structure.[53]:page:42 In addition Hall found the project had proceeded for nine years without the development of a concise client brief. To bring himself up to speed, Hall investigated concert and opera venues overseas and engaged stage consultant Ben Schlange and acoustic consultant Wilhelm Jordan, while establishing his team. In consultation with all the potential building users the first Review of Program was completed in January 1967. The most significant conclusion reached by Hall was that concert and opera were incompatible in the same hall.[53]:page:53 Although Utzon had sketched ideas using plywood for the great enclosing glass walls their structural viability was unresolved when Hall took on the design role.[53]:page:49 With the ability to delegate tasks and effectively coordinate the work of consultants, Hall guided the project for over five years until the opening day in 1973.\\r\\nA former Government Architect, Peter Webber, in his book Peter Hall: the Phantom of the Opera House, concludes: when Utzon resigned no one was better qualified (than Hall) to rise to the challenge of completing the design of the Opera House.[53]:page:126\\r\\nThe Sydney Opera House was formally opened by Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, on 20 October 1973. A large crowd attended. Utzon was not invited to the ceremony, nor was his name mentioned. The opening was televised and included fireworks and a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9.[55]\\r\\nDuring the construction phase, lunchtime performances were often arranged for the workers, with American vocalist Paul Robeson the first artist to perform, in 1960.\\r\\nVarious performances were presented prior to the official opening:\\r\\nAfter the opening:\\r\\nIn the late 1990s, the Sydney Opera House Trust resumed communication with Utzon in an attempt to effect a reconciliation and to secure his involvement in future changes to the building. In 1999, he was appointed by the Trust as a design consultant for future work.[60]\\r\\nIn 2004, the first interior space rebuilt to an Utzon design was opened, and renamed \\"The Utzon Room\\" in his honour. It contains an original Utzon tapestry (14.00 x 3.70 metres) called Homage to Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach.[61] In April 2007, he proposed a major reconstruction of the Opera Theatre, as it was then known.[62] Utzon died on 29 November 2008.[63]\\r\\nA state memorial service, attended by Utzon's son Jan and daughter Lin, celebrating his creative genius, was held in the Concert Hall on 25 March 2009 featuring performances, readings and recollections from prominent figures in the Australian performing arts scene.\\r\\nRefurbished Western Foyer and Accessibility improvements were commissioned on 17 November 2009, the largest building project completed since Utzon was re-engaged in 1999. Designed by Utzon and his son Jan, the project provided improved ticketing, toilet and cloaking facilities. New escalators and a public lift enabled enhanced access for the disabled and families with prams. The prominent paralympian athlete Louise Sauvage was announced as the building's \\"accessibility ambassador\\" to advise on further improvements to aid people with disabilities.[64]\\r\\nOn 29 March 2016, an original 1959 tapestry by Le Corbusier (2.18 x 3.55 metres), commissioned by Utzon to be hung in the Sydney Opera House and called Les Ds Sont Jets (The Dice Are Cast), was finally unveiled in situ after being owned by the Utzon family and held at their home in Denmark for over 50 years. The tapestry was bought at auction by the Sydney Opera House in June 2015. It now hangs in the building's Western Foyer and is accessible to the public.\\r\\nIn the second half of 2017, the Joan Sutherland Theatre was closed to replace the stage machinery and for other works. The Concert Hall is scheduled for work in 2020-2021.\\r\\nIn 1993, Constantine Koukias was commissioned by the Sydney Opera House Trust in association with REM Theatre to compose Icon, a large-scale music theatre piece for the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Opera House [65]\\r\\nDuring the 2000 Summer Olympics, the venue served as the focal point for the triathlon events. The event had a 1.5?km (0.9?mi) swimming loop at Farm Cove, along with competitions in the neighbouring Royal Botanical Gardens for the cycling and running portions of the event.[66]\\r\\nSince 2013, a group of residents from the nearby Bennelong Apartments (better known as 'The Toaster'), calling themselves the Sydney Opera House Concerned Citizens Group, have been campaigning against Forecourt Concerts on the grounds that they exceed noise levels outlined in the development approval (DA). In February 2017 the NSW Department of Planning and the Environment handed down a $15,000 fine to the Sydney Opera House for breach of allowed noise levels at a concert held in November 2015. However the DA was amended in 2016 to allow an increase in noise levels in the forecourt by 5 decibels. The residents opposing the concerts contend that a new DA should have been filed rather than an amendment.[67][68]\\r\\nThe Sydney Opera House sails formed a graphic projection-screen in a lightshow mounted in connection with the International Fleet Review in Sydney Harbour on 5 October 2013.[69]\\r\\nOn 31 December 2013, the venue's 40th anniversary year, a New Year firework display was mounted for the first time in a decade.[70]\\r\\nThe Sydney Opera House hosted an event on Friday 21 February 2014 that won a historic Guinness World Record.[71]\\r\\n This Wikipedia article was originally based on the Sydney Opera House, listed on the \\"New South Wales State Heritage Register\\" published by the Government of New South Wales under CC-BY 3.0 AU licence (accessed on 3 September 2017).","input":"When did the sydney opera house became a world heritage site?"},{"output":"George Washington","context":"","input":"Who is the first president of our country?"},{"output":"ten fixed months","context":"The Roman calendar is the calendar used by the Roman kingdom and republic. It is often inclusive of the Julian calendar established by the reforms of the dictator Julius Caesar and emperor Augustus in the late 1st?century?BC and sometimes inclusive of any system dated by inclusive counting towards months' kalends, nones, and ides in the Roman manner. It is usually exclusive of the Alexandrian calendar of Roman Egypt, which continued the unique months of that land's former calendar; the Byzantine calendar of the later Roman Empire, which usually dated the Roman months in the simple count of the ancient Greek calendars; and the Gregorian calendar, which refined the Julian system to bring it into still closer alignment with the solar year and is the basis of the current international standard.\\r\\nRoman dates were counted inclusively forward to the next of three principal days: the first of the month (the kalends), a day less than the middle of the month (the ides), and eight daysnine, counting inclusivelybefore this (the nones). The original calendar consisted of 10 months beginning in spring with March; winter was left as an unassigned span of days. These months ran for 38 nundinal cycles, each forming a kind of eight (i.e., \\"nine\\") day week ended by religious rituals and a public market. The winter period was then used to create January and February. The legendary early kings Romulus and Numa were traditionally credited with establishing this early fixed calendar, which bears traces of its origin as an observational lunar one. In particular, the kalends, nones, and ides seem to have derived from the first sighting of the crescent moon, the first-quarter moon, and the full moon respectively. The system ran well short of the solar year, and it needed constant intercalation to keep religious festivals and other activities in their proper seasons. For superstitious reasons, such intercalation occurred within the month of February even after it was no longer considered the last month.\\r\\nAfter the establishment of the Roman Republic, years began to be dated by consulships and control over intercalation was granted to the pontifices, who eventually abused their power by lengthening years controlled by their political allies and shortening the years in their rivals' terms of office. Having won his war with Pompey, Caesar used his position as Rome's chief pontiff to enact a calendar reform in 46?BC, coincidentally making the year of his third consulship last for 446 days. In order to avoid interfering with Rome's religious ceremonies, the reform added all its days towards the ends of months and did not adjust any nones or ides, even in months which came to have 31 days. The Julian calendar was supposed to have a single leap day on 24 February (a doubled VI Kal. Mart.) every fourth year but following Caesar's assassination the priests figured this using inclusive counting and mistakenly added the bissextile day every three years. In order to bring the calendar back to its proper place, Augustus was obliged to suspend intercalation for a few decades. The revised calendar remaining slightly longer than the solar year, the date of Easter shifted far enough away from the vernal equinox that Pope Gregory?XIII ordered its adjustment in the 16th century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Roman calendar is believed to have been an observational lunar calendar[1] whose months began from the first signs of a new crescent moon. Because a lunar cycle is about ?29?1?2 days long, such months would have varied between 29 and 30 days. Twelve such months would have fallen 10 or 11 days short of the solar year; without adjustment, such a year would have quickly rotated out of alignment with the seasons in the manner of the present-day Islamic calendar. Given the seasonal aspects of the later calendar and its associated religious festivals, this was presumably avoided through some form of intercalation or through the suspension of the calendar during winter.\\r\\nRome's 8-day week, the nundinal cycle, was shared with the Etruscans, who used it as the schedule of royal audiences. It was presumably a feature of the early calendar and was credited in Roman legend variously to Romulus and Servius Tullius.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Romans themselves described their first organized year as one with ten fixed months, each of 30 or 31 days.[2][3] Such a decimal division fit general Roman practice.[4] The four 31-day months were called \\"full\\" (pleni) and the others \\"hollow\\" (cavi).[a][6] Its 304 days made up exactly 38 nundinal cycles. The system is usually said to have left the remaining 50-odd days of the year as an unorganized \\"winter\\", although Licinius Macer's lost history apparently stated the earliest Roman calendar employed intercalation instead[7][8] and Macrobius claims the 10-month calendar was allowed to shift until the summer and winter months were completely misplaced, at which time additional days belonging to no month were simply inserted into the calendar until it seemed things were restored to their proper place.[9][10]\\r\\nLater Roman writers credited this calendar to Romulus,[11][12] their legendary first king and culture hero, although this was common with other practices and traditions whose origin had been lost to them. Some scholars doubt the existence of this calendar at all, as it is only attested in late Republican and Imperial sources and apparently supported only by the misplaced names of the months from September to December.[13] Rpke also finds the coincidence of the length of the supposed \\"Romulan\\" year with the length of the first ten months of the Julian calendar to be suspicious.[clarification needed][13]\\r\\nOther traditions existed alongside this one, however. Plutarch's Parallel Lives recounts that Romulus's calendar had been solar but adhered to the general principle that the year should last for 360 days. Months were employed secondarily and haphazardly, with some counted as 20 days and others as 35 or more.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attested calendar of the Roman Republic was quite different. It followed Greek calendars in assuming a lunar cycle of ?29?1?2 days and a solar year of ?12?1?2 synodic months (?368?3?4 days), which align every fourth year after the addition of two intercalary months.[6] The additional two months of the year were January and February; the intercalary month was sometimes known as Mercedonius.[6]\\r\\nThe Romans did not follow the usual Greek practice in alternating 29- and 30-day months and a 29- or 30-day intercalary month every other year. Instead, their 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 10th months[b] had 31 days each; all the other months had 29 days except February, which had 28 days for three years and then 29 every fourth year. The total of these months over a 4-year span differed from the Greeks by 5 days, meaning the Roman intercalary month always had 27 days. Similarly, within each month, the weeks did not vary in the Greek fashion between 7 and 8 days; instead, the full months had two additional days in their first week and the other three weeks of every month ran for 8 days (\\"nine\\" by Roman reckoning).[19] Still more unusually, the intercalary month was not placed at the end of the year but within the month of February after the Terminalia on the 23rd (a.d. VII Kal. Mart.); the remaining days of February followed its completion. This seems to have arisen from Roman superstitions concerning the numbering and order of the months.[citation needed] The arrangement of the Roman calendar similarly seems to have arisen from Pythagorean superstitions concerning the luckiness of odd numbers.[19]\\r\\nThese Pythagorean-based changes to the Roman calendar were generally credited by the Romans to Numa Pompilius, Romulus's successor and the second of Rome's seven kings,[citation needed] as were the two new months of the calendar.[20][21][c] Most sources thought he had established intercalation with the rest of his calendar.[citation needed] Although Livy's Numa instituted a lunar calendar, the author claimed the king had instituted a 19-year system of intercalation equivalent to the Metonic Cycle[22] centuries before its development by Babylonian and Greek astronomers.[d] Plutarch's account claims he ended the former chaos of the calendar by employing 12 months totaling 354 daysthe length of the lunar and Greek yearsand biennial intercalary months of 22 days.[17][18]\\r\\nPlutarch believed Numa was responsible for placing January and February first in the calendar;[17][18] Ovid states January began as the first month and February the last, with its present order owing to the Decemvirs.[24][25] W. Warde Fowler believed the Roman priests continued to treat January and February as the last months of the calendar throughout the Republican period.[26]\\r\\nThe consuls' terms of office were not always a modern calendar year, but ordinary consuls were elected or appointed annually. The traditional list of Roman consuls used by the Romans to date their years began in 509?BC.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nGnaeus Flavius, a secretary to the pontifex maximus, introduced a series of reforms in 304?BC.[30] Their exact nature is uncertain, although he is thought to have begun the custom of publishing the calendar in advance of the month, depriving the priests of some of their power but allowing for a more consistent calendar for official business.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nJulius Caesar, following his victory in his civil war and in his role as pontifex maximus, ordered a reformation of the calendar in 46?BC. This was undertaken by a group of scholars apparently including the Alexandrian Sosigenes[32] and the Roman M. Flavius.[33][28] Its main lines involved the insertion of ten additional days throughout the calendar and regular intercalation of a single leap day every fourth year in order to bring the Roman calendar into close agreement with the solar year. The year 46?BC was the last of the old system and included 3 intercalary months, the first inserted in February and two moreIntercalaris Prior and Posteriorbefore the kalends of December.\\r\\nAfter Caesar's assassination, Mark Antony had Caesar's birth month Quintilis renamed July (Iulius) in his honor. After Antony's defeat at Actium, Augustus assumed control of Rome and, finding the priests had (owing to their inclusive counting) been intercalating every third year instead of every fourth, suspended the addition of leap days to the calendar for a number of decades until its proper position had been restored. In 8?BC, the plebiscite Lex Pacuvia de Mense Augusto caused Sextilis to be renamed August (Augustus) in his honor.[34][35][28][e]\\r\\nIn large part, this calendar continued unchanged under the Roman Empire. (Egyptians used the related Alexandrian calendar, which Augustus had adapted from their wandering ancient calendar to maintain its alignment with Rome's.) A few emperors altered the names of the months after themselves or their family, but such changes were abandoned by their successors. Diocletian began the 15-year indiction cycles beginning from the AD?297 census;[29] these became the required format for official dating under Justinian. Constantine formally established the 7-day week by making Sunday an official holiday in 321. Consular dating became obsolete following the abandonment of appointing nonimperial consuls in AD?541.[29] The Roman method of numbering the days of the month never became widespread in the Hellenized eastern provinces and was eventually abandoned by the Byzantine Empire in its calendar.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoman dates were counted inclusively forward to the next one of three principal days within each month:[36]\\r\\nThese are thought to reflect a prehistoric lunar calendar, with the kalends proclaimed after the sighting of the first sliver of the new crescent moon a day or two after the new moon, the nones occurring on the day of the first-quarter moon, and the ides on the day of the full moon. The kalends of each month were sacred to Juno and the ides to Jupiter.[38][39] The day before each was known as its eve (pridie); the day after each (postridie) was considered particularly unlucky.\\r\\nThe days of the month were expressed in early Latin using the ablative of time, denoting points in time, in the contracted form \\"the 6th December Kalends\\" (VI Kalendas Decembres).[37] In classical Latin, this use continued for the three principal days of the month[40] but other days were idiomatically expressed in the accusative case, which usually expressed a duration of time, and took the form \\"6th day before the December Kalends\\" (ante diem VI Kalendas Decembres). This anomaly may have followed the treatment of days in Greek,[41] reflected the increasing use of such date phrases as an absolute phrase able to function as the object of another preposition,[37] or simply originated in a mistaken agreement of dies with the preposition ante once it moved to the beginning of the expression.[37] In late Latin, this idiom was sometimes abandoned in favor of again using the ablative of time.\\r\\nThe kalends were the day for payment of debts and the account books (kalendaria) kept for them gave English its word calendar. The public Roman calendars were the fasti, which designated the religious and legal character of each month's days. The Romans marked each day of such calendars with the letters:[42]\\r\\nEach day was also marked by a letter from A to H to indicate its place within the nundinal cycle of market days.\\r\\nThe nundinae were the market days which formed a kind of weekend in Rome, Italy, and some other parts of Roman territory. By Roman inclusive counting, they were reckoned as \\"ninth days\\" although they actually occurred every eighth day. Because the republican and Julian years were not evenly divisible into eight-day periods, Roman calendars included a column giving every day of the year a nundinal letter from A to H marking its place in the cycle of market days. Each year, the letter used for the markets would shift 2ÿ5 letters along the cycle. As a day when the city swelled with rural plebeians, they were overseen by the aediles and took on an important role in Roman legislation, which was supposed to be announced for three nundinal weeks (between 17 and 24 days) in advance of its coming to a vote. The patricians and their clients sometimes exploited this fact as a kind of filibuster, since the tribunes of the plebs were required to wait another three-week period if their proposals could not receive a vote before dusk on the day they were introduced. Superstitions arose concerning the bad luck that followed a nundinae on the nones of a month or, later, on the first day of January. Intercalation was supposedly used to avoid such coincidences, even after the Julian reform of the calendar.\\r\\nThe 7-day week began to be observed in Italy in the early imperial period,[44] as practitioners and converts to eastern religions introduced Hellenistic and Babylonian astrology, the Jewish Saturday sabbath, and the Christian Lord's Day. The system was originally used for private worship and astrology but had replaced the nundinal week by the time Constantine made Sunday (dies Solis) an official day of rest in AD?321. The hebdomadal week was also reckoned as a cycle of letters from A to G; these were adapted for Christian use as the dominical letters.\\r\\nThe names of Roman months originally functioned as adjectives (e.g., the January kalends occur in the January month) before being treated as substantive nouns in their own right (e.g., the kalends of January occur in January). Some of their etymologies are well-established: January and March honor the gods Janus[45] and Mars;[46] July and August honor the dictator Julius Caesar[47] and his successor, the emperor Augustus;[48] and the months Quintilis,[49] Sextilis,[50] September,[51] October,[52] November,[53] and December[54] are archaic adjectives formed from the ordinal numbers from 5 to 10, their position in the calendar when it began around the spring equinox in March.[51] Others are uncertain. February may derive from the Februa festival or its eponymous februa (\\"purifications, expiatory offerings\\"), whose name may be either Sabine or preserve an archaic word for sulphuric.[55] April may relate to the Etruscan goddess Apru or the verb aperire (\\"to open\\").[citation needed] May and June may honor Maia[56] and Juno[57] or derive from archaic terms for \\"senior\\" and \\"junior\\". A few emperors attempted to add themselves to the calendar after Augustus, but without enduring success.\\r\\nIn classical Latin, the days of each month were usually reckoned as:[40]\\r\\nDates after the ides count forward to the kalends of the next month and are expressed as such. For example, March 19 was expressed as \\"the 14th day before the April Kalends\\" (a.d. XIV Kal. Apr.), without a mention of March itself. The day after a kalends, nones, or ides was also often expressed as the \\"day after\\" (postridie) owing to their special status as particularly unlucky \\"black days\\".\\r\\nThe anomalous status of the new 31-day months under the Julian calendar was an effect of Caesar's desire to avoid affecting the festivals tied to the nones and ides of various months, because the dates at the ends of the month all counted forward to the next kalends, however, they were all shifted by one or two days by the change. This created confusion with regard to certain anniversaries. For instance, Augustus's birthday on the 23rd day of September was a.d. VIII Kal. Oct. in the old calendar but a.d. IX Kal. Oct. under the new system. The ambiguity caused honorary festivals to be held on either or both dates.\\r\\nThe Republican calendar only had 355 days, which meant that it would quickly unsynchronize from the solar year, causing, for example, agricultural festivals to occur out of season. The Roman solution to this problem was to periodically lengthen the calendar by adding extra days within February. February was broken into two parts, each with an odd number of days. The first part ended with the Terminalia on the 23rd (a.d. VII Kal. Mart.), which was considered the end of the religious year; the five remaining days beginning with the Regifugium on the 24th (a.d. VI Kal. Mart.) formed the second part; and the intercalary month Mercedonius was inserted between them. In such years, the days between the ides and the Regifugium were counted down to either the Intercalary Kalends or to the Terminalia. The intercalary month counted down to nones and ides on its 5th and 13th day in the manner of the other short months. The remaining days of the month counted down towards the March Kalends, so that the end of Mercedonius and the second part of February were indistinguishable to the Romans, one ending on a.d. VII Kal. Mart. and the other picking up at a.d. VI Kal. Mart. and bearing the normal festivals of such dates.\\r\\nApparently because of the confusion of these changes or uncertainty as to whether an intercalary month would be ordered, dates after the February ides are attested as sometimes counting down towards the Quirinalia (Feb. 17), the Feralia (Feb. 21), or Terminalia (Feb. 23)[58] rather than the intercalary or March kalends.\\r\\nThe third-century writer Censorinus says:\\r\\nWhen it was thought necessary to add (every two years) an intercalary month of 22 or 23 days, so that the civil year should correspond to the natural (solar) year, this intercalation was in preference made in February, between Terminalia [23rd] and Regifugium [24th].[59]\\r\\nThe fifth-century writer Macrobius says that the Romans intercalated 22 and 23 days in alternate years (Saturnalia, 1.13.12); the intercalation was placed after 23 February and the remaining five days of February followed (Saturnalia, 1.13.15). To avoid the nones falling on a nundine, where necessary an intercalary day was inserted \\"in the middle of the Terminalia, where they placed the intercalary month\\".[60]\\r\\nThis is historically correct. In 167 BC Intercalaris began on the day after 23 February [61] and in 170 BC it began on the second day after 23 February.[62] Varro, writing in the first century BC, says \\"the twelfth month was February, and when intercalations take place the five last days of this month are removed.\\"[63] Since all the days after the Ides of Intercalaris were counted down to the beginning of March Intercalaris had either 27 days (making 377 for the year) or 28 (making 378 for the year).\\r\\nThere is another theory which says that in intercalary years February had 23 or 24 days and Intercalaris had 27. No date is offered for the Regifugium in 378-day years.[64] Macrobius describes a further refinement whereby, in one 8-year period within a 24-year cycle, there were only three intercalary years, each of 377 days. This refinement brings the calendar back in line with the seasons, and averages the length of the year to 365.25 days over 24 years.\\r\\nThe Pontifex Maximus determined when an intercalary month was to be inserted. On average, this happened in alternate years. The system of aligning the year through intercalary months broke down at least twice: the first time was during and after the Second Punic War. It led to the reform of the 191?BC Acilian Law on Intercalation, the details of which are unclear, but it appears to have successfully regulated intercalation for over a century. The second breakdown was in the middle of the first century?BC and may have been related to the increasingly chaotic and adversarial nature of Roman politics at the time. The position of Pontifex Maximus was not a full-time job; it was held by a member of the Roman elite, who would almost invariably be involved in the machinations of Roman politics. Because the term of office of elected Roman magistrates was defined in terms of a Roman calendar year, a Pontifex Maximus would have reason to lengthen a year in which he or his allies were in power or shorten a year in which his political opponents held office.\\r\\nAlthough there are many stories to interpret the intercalation, a period of 22 or 23 days is always ? synodic month. Obviously, the month beginning shifts forward (from the new moon, to the third quarter, to the full moon, to the first quarter, back the new moon) after intercalation.\\r\\nAs mentioned above, Rome's legendary 10-month calendar notionally lasted for 304 days but was usually thought to make up the rest of the solar year during an unorganized winter period. The unattested but almost certain lunar year and the pre-Julian civil year were 354 or 355 days long, with the difference from the solar year more or less corrected by an irregular intercalary month. The Julian year was 365 days long, with a leap day doubled in length every fourth year, almost equivalent to the present Gregorian system.\\r\\nThe calendar era before and under the Roman kings is uncertain but dating by regnal years was common in antiquity. Under the Roman Republic, from 509?BC, years were most commonly described in terms of their reigning ordinary consuls.[29] (Temporary and honorary consuls were sometimes elected or appointed but were not used in dating.)[29] Consular lists were displayed on the public calendars. After the institution of the Roman Empire, regnal dates based on the emperors' terms in office became more common. Some historians of the later republic and early imperial eras dated from the legendary founding of the city of Rome (ab urbe condita or AVC).[29] Varro's date for this was 753?BC but other writers used different dates, varying by several decades.[citation needed] Such dating was, however, never widespread. After the consuls waned in importance, most Roman dating was regnal[66] or followed Diocletian's 15-year Indiction tax cycle.[29] These cycles were not distinguished, however, so that \\"year 2 of the indiction\\" may refer to any of 298, 313, 328, &c.[29] The Orthodox subjects of the Byzantine Empire used various Christian eras, including those based on Diocletian's persecutions, Christ's incarnation, and the supposed age of the world.\\r\\nThe Romans did not have records of their early calendars but, like modern historians, assumed the year originally began in March on the basis of the names of the months following June. The consul M. Fulvius Nobilior (r.?189?BC) wrote a commentary on the calendar at the Temple of Hercules Musarum that claimed January had been named for Janus because the god faced both ways,[67][where?] suggesting it had been instituted as a first month.[citation needed] It was, however, usually said to have been instituted along with February, whose nature and festivals suggest it had originally been considered the last month of the year. The consuls' term of officeand thus the order of the years under the republicseems to have changed several times. Their inaugurations were finally moved to 1?January (Kal. Ian.) in 153?BC to allow Q. Fulvius Nobilior to attack Segeda in Spain during the Celtiberian Wars, before which they had occurred on 15?March (Eid. Mart.).[68] There is reason to believe the inauguration date had been 1?May during the 3rd century BC until 222?BC[citation needed] and Livy mentions earlier inaugurations on 15?May (Eid. Mai.), 1?July (Kal. Qui.), 1?August (Kal. Sex.), 1?October (Kal. Oct.), and 15?December (Eid. Dec.).[69][where?] Under the Julian calendar, the year began on 1?January but years of the Indiction cycle began on 1?September.\\r\\nIn addition Egypt's separate calendar, some provinces maintained their records using a local era.[29] Africa dated its records sequentially from 39?BC;[66] Spain from AD?38.[citation needed] This dating system continued as the Spanish era used in medieval Spain.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe continuity of names from the Roman to the Gregorian calendar can lead to the mistaken belief that Roman dates correspond to Julian or Gregorian ones. In fact, the essentially complete list of Roman consuls allows general certainty of years back to the establishment of the republic but the uncertainty as to the end of lunar dating and the irregularity of Roman intercalation means that dates which can be independently verified are invariably weeks to months outside of their \\"proper\\" place. Two astronomical events dated by Livy show the calendar 4 months out of alignment with the Julian date in 190?BC and 2 months out of alignment in 168?BC. Thus, \\"the year of the consulship of Publius Cornelius Sciopio Africanus and Publius Licinius Crassus\\" (usually given as \\"205?BC\\") actually began on 15?March 205?BC and ended on 14?March 204?BC according to the Roman calendar but may have begun as early as November or December 206?BC owing to its misalignment. Even following the establishment of the Julian calendar, the leap years were not applied correctly by the Roman priests, meaning dates are a few days out of their \\"proper\\" place until a few decades into Augustus's reign.\\r\\nGiven the paucity of records regarding the state of the calendar and its intercalation, historians have reconstructed the correspondence of Roman dates to their Julian and Gregorian equivalents from disparate sources. There are detailed accounts of the decades leading up to the Julian reform, particularly the speeches and letters of Cicero, which permit an established chronology back to about 58?BC. The nundinal cycle and a few known synchronismse.g., a Roman date in terms of the Attic calendar and Olympiadare used to generate contested chronologies back to the start of the First Punic War in 264?BC. Beyond that, dates are roughly known based on clues such as the dates of harvests and seasonal religious festivals.","input":"How many months are in the roman calendar?"},{"output":"Kenneth Langone","context":"NYU Langone Medical Center is one of the premier academic medical centers in the United States, located in New York City, New York, United States, affiliated with New York University.

As the water level increases in the caisson, the air inside is compressed, which is then used to drive an air turbine.[3] The power generated from this plant, however, varied a lot throughout the year and maximum power was generated only during the monsoon months.[3] After a long duration of being out of use, it was planned to be utilized for powering a Reverse Osmosis Desalination plant in 2004.[3][5] This project also was not successful and the wave energy plant was finally decommissioned in 2011.[3][5]\\r\\nWave energy is amongst the most capital intensive form of renewable energy. Current cost of wave energy varies between 34 and 63 c?/kWh.[3]According to a study by IIT Madras and CRISIL, wave energy technologies would require about 10 GW of cumulative capacity to become cost competitive.[3]\\r\\nWave energy is a clean and renewable source of energy. Since waves are present always, wave power is more consistent in electricity generation when compared to renewable energy sources like wind and solar. They can be a good source of energy generation for off grid coastal areas and islands. Wave energy often used to power the desalination plants. Wave energy turbines when combined with offshore breakwaters can help achieve the protection of sea shores.[3]\\r\\nThere are several challenges that need to be addressed to make electricity generation from wave energy commercially viable.Technological challenges include low turbine efficiencies, high turbine costs, unavailability of grid connections at potential sites, lack of experience and unpredictable environmental conditions.[3] Owing to inadequate data, it is challenging to estimate the impact of wave power generation on marine ecosystem.[3] Moreover, investment in wave power is perceived as risky investment by financial institutions because of high capital cost and lack of operational experience.[3]\\r\\nThe Ministry of Earth Sciences in Government of India oversees the development of wave energy in India with National Institute of Ocean Technology, Chennai being a participating institution.[7] The ministry envisions development of wave energy to power Low Temperature Thermal Desalination (LTTD) plants and to meet the lighting requirements of small islands.[8]\\r\\nIndia government has set a target of achieving 40% cumulative electrical power capacity from non fossil fuel resources by 2030. It plans to enhance the renewable power installed capacity to 175 GW by the end of 2022 which includes 60 GW from wind power, 100 GW from solar power, 10 GW from biomass power and 5 GW from small hydro power.[9] There is however no specific target for wave power capacity enhancement.","input":"Where was the first ocean wave energy pilot power plant installed in india?"},{"output":"29 inches","context":"Hurricane Madeline was the final tropical cyclone of the 1998 Pacific hurricane season. Madeline originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa on September 25, 1998. The wave traversed the Atlantic Ocean and crossed over Central America on October 5 or 6. Gradually, the system intensified and was classified as a tropical depression on October 16, a tropical storm later that day, and a hurricane on October 17. The storm reached peak winds of 85?mph (137?km/h) about 95 miles (153?km) southwest of San Blas, Nayarit, and after 18?hours it subsequently began to weaken. Although Madeline never made landfall, numerous rainbands affected the Mexican coast causing no known damage or fatalities. The remnant moisture moved north and contributed to flooding in central Texas, which killed 31?people and caused $750?million (1998?USD) in damage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 25, 1998 a tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa, producing intermittent concentrated clusters of convective activity. The wave traversed the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea before crossing Central America on October 5 or October 6. After several days, convection increased, and Dvorak classifications initiated. Satellite imagery indicated that the system dissipated on October 11, although an area of cloudiness persisted off the coast of Mexico. After four days, the system regenerated and under diffluent flow aloft, deep convection became more concentrated;[1] it is estimated that a tropical depression formed at 0000?UTC on October 16, about 230?mi (370?km) west-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico.[2] Initially, due to disorganization, determining the forward movement of depression was difficult,[3] although a few hours later it was estimated that the system was tracking to the north-northwest.[4] With favorable conditions aloft, the deep convection became more concentrated, and 12?hours after first developing, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Madeline about 170 miles (270?km) southwest of Cabo Corrientes.[2]\\r\\nDuring the afternoon, convective cloud tops warmed slightly although the storm continued to intensify.[5] Soon after, thunderstorm activity became limited as Madeline remained generally stationary in movement.[6] An approaching mid-level trough turned Madeline to the northeast. Banding features gradually improved in organization, and late on October 17 the storm attained hurricane status.[2] However, satellite imagery indicated that convective activity was confined to the western portion of the storm, and at the same time an eye began to form.[7] Early on October 18, data from a Reconnaissance aircraft flight into the storm found a minimum central pressure of 985?mbar (29.1?inHg), as the storm was drifting to the northeast at around 4?mph (6.4?km/h) near the western edge of a large-scale eastÿwest ridge axis.[8] The apparent eye became cloud-filled shortly thereafter, and a slight increase in temperature was discovered near the center. Despite this, upper-level outflow was favorable, leading to predictions of slight intensification.[9]\\r\\nShortly thereafter, Madeline attained peak winds of 85?mph (137?km/h) about 95 miles (153?km) southwest of San Blas, Nayarit. The hurricane maintained peak winds for about 18?hours while curving again to the northwest.[2] With evidence of southern wind shear, only a small area of deep thunderstorm activity existed on October 19, and the system began to appear ill-defined of satellite imagery.[10] The hurricane quickly weakened into a tropical storm,[2] and by later that day, the storm became void of convection due to strong wind shear.[11] On October 19, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression, leaving just a swirl of low clouds midway between the southern tip of Baja California and mainland Mexico.[2] By 0600?UTC on October 20, the remnants of Madeline had completely dissipated.[2]\\r\\nIn anticipation of Madeline, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for the Baja California Peninsula southward from La Paz, and a hurricane warning from San Patricio, Jalisco to El Dorado, Sinaloa, including the Islas Maras. The storm was initially forecast to move ashore near Mazatln, prompting officials to close the city's port. President Ernesto Zedillo advised potentially affected residents to stay indoors or seek refuge in shelters.[12] Also, the threat of the hurricane canceled a fishing expedition in the Gulf of California due to rough surf. The expedition was to provide a new aquarium in downtown Denver, Colorado with about 8,500?fish.[13] Mexican authorities deployed 2,000?soldiers in remote areas of the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa to prepare for the hurricane. Several thousand residents and tourists at the resorts of Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan were put on standby to evacuate their homes.[14] Authorities along the coast in the state of Nayarit went house to house, advising people about the oncoming storm.[15] In addition, ships from Salina Cruz to Acapulco were advised to stay in port.[16]\\r\\nAlthough Madeline never crossed the coast, numerous rainbands affected the Mexican coast, dropping up to 9.8?in (250?mm).[17] Despite this, no damage or fatalities were reported in Mexico.[2] After the storm had dissipated, the remnant plume of moisture contributed to severe flooding in central Texas.[18] Rainfall in Texas reached 22 inches (560?mm) in some locations. Thirty-one people died due to the flooding, and damage totaled to $750?million (1998?USD).[19] A total of 24 of the deaths were drownings, 22 of them were caused by driving vehicles into high water on a road flooded by the torrential downpours. There were 16 different incidents when these types of deaths occurred, four of them involving in multiple deaths. Three others died due to trauma, and one died from hypothermia after the person was submerged in the water.[20] The greatest impact was in Southern Texas, which included the urban areas of San Antonio and Austin, and all of their surrounding suburbs. The counties with the most significant rainfall, damage, and fatalities were Travis County, Bexar County, Guadalupe County, Comal County, and Caldwell County. This area included both the cities of San Antonio and Austin. In a small area in Caldwell County, there was 29 inches (740?mm) of rain estimated by the United States Geological Survey. This included the area of Lockhart, Texas, which was badly flooded by the storm due to its close proximity to the San Marcos River. Most of the county picked up an estimated 20 to 30?in (510 to 760?mm) of rain, including San Marcos, Texas, New Braunfels, Texas, and Kyle, Texas.[21] In all, portions of 60 counties in Texas were flooded and hundreds of people were forced to flee their homes.[22]\\r\\nDue to the flooding, twenty counties were declared federal disaster areas, clearing the way for assistance such as federal loans. Then-president Bill Clinton promised aid to the victims of the storm and then-governor George W. Bush took a tour of the devastated region with the Federal Emergency Management Agency director.[23]","input":"How much rain did san antonio get in the flood of 1998?"},{"output":"Ivan Cleary","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Zealand Warriors are a professional rugby league football club based in Auckland, New Zealand that compete in the National Rugby League (NRL) premiership and are the League's only team from outside Australia. They were formerly known as the Auckland Warriors, and are officially known as the Vodafone Warriors for sponsorship reasons.[2] The Warriors are coached by Stephen Kearney and captained by Roger Tuivasa-Sheck. They are based at Mt Smart Stadium in the Auckland suburb of Penrose.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 1995 season the newly-formed Auckland Warriors became the first club from outside Australia to be admitted to the Australian Rugby League's premiership when it expanded from 16 to 20 teams. As a result of the Super League war in the mid-1990s, Auckland left the ARL to compete in the Super League competition of 1997, before joining the re-unified NRL the following year. They re-branded themselves the New Zealand Warriors in 2001. Over 21 seasons the Warriors have claimed one minor premiership (in 2002), reached two grand finals (2002 and 2011), reached the play-offs seven times, and provided the majority of the New Zealand national team's players.\\r\\n\\r\\nRugby league was largely centred around Auckland ever since the New Zealand Rugby League was founded in 1909. Auckland produced the bulk of the international squad for many years, and most of these players headed to either Australia or Great Britain to play.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Auckland representative side was consistently providing top opposition to touring teams. An Auckland team was admitted into the mid-week ARL Amco Cup competition in 1978. In their first year they made the semi-finals, and were defeated by the overall competition winners, Eastern Suburbs. They remained into the competition until the early 1980s. In 1987, an Auckland side toured Great Britain and claimed wins over powerhouse clubs Leeds and Wigan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, serious investigation into an Auckland team entering the New South Wales Rugby League premiership commenced, encouraged mainly by the Mt Albert club. On 17 May 1992, the announcement stating an Auckland-based team's entry into the Australian Rugby League competition, the Winfield Cup in 1995, was made. This followed very good turnouts to a number of NSWRL club games played in Auckland. The new team was to be called the Auckland Warriors and run by the Auckland Rugby League organisation. The original colours selected were blue, white, red and green. Blue and white are recognised as the colours of Auckland, while red and green were the colours of the Warriors' original sponsor, DB Bitter. The original logo was designed by Francis Allan, of Colenso.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coach of the new team would be former Parramatta and Wigan coach John Monie. A number of senior players were signed, such as Greg Alexander and Andy Platt. Captain Dean Bell was a high-performing signing. Former Rugby union players such as John Kirwan and Marc Ellis were brought in, in later years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors' first year in the Australian Rugby League was 1995. Their debut match was against the Brisbane Broncos on 10 March 1995 in front of 30,000 people at a newly refurbished Mt Smart Stadium. The Warriors led 22ÿ10 at one point in the second half of the match, however the Broncos defeated the new club 25ÿ22.\\r\\n\\r\\nA home crowd attendance record of 32,174 was set at Ericsson Stadium in Round 6 of the 1995 ARL season, a record that was not topped until Round 1 of the 2011 NRL season.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors were deducted two competition points for an interchange error. In a match against Western Suburbs, the Warriors used five interchange players instead of the allowed four. The Warriors won the match comfortably, 46ÿ12. This error had disastrous consequences for the club, as they ultimately missed the finals by two competition points. The season saw the debut of future star, Stacey Jones, who scored a try on debut in a 40ÿ4 rout of Parramatta in Sydney. The biggest issue with the season was the lack of consistency, that is evident with the Warriors even today, despite a six match winning streak late in the season. It was observed that when the Warriors were not winning by 20 points they were losing by 20 points.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Rugby League season 1996 could have been regarded as a better one for the Warriors. The Warriors found themselves siding with the Super League during the Super League War when the New Zealand Rugby League signed up to the rebel competition. They claimed their first 'victory' over the Broncos in round one of the competition that year, after all Super League clubs agreed to boycott the first round of the competition in protest. The Warriors won the two points when they travelled to Brisbane with a squad of players that were unsigned to Super League, forcing the Broncos to forfeit the match.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith four rounds remaining the Warriors were in sixth place in the competition, seemingly headed for a finals berth. They proceeded to lose all four matches to tumble out of the finals. The only positives were that young New Zealand talents Stacey Jones and Joe Vagana had superb seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors spent 1997 in the breakaway Super League Telstra Cup competition. Despite the reduced number of teams, they failed to make an impression on the competition. Monie was replaced by Frank Endacott as coach midway through the 1997 season. The only positive was the team's performance in the World Club Challenge. The Warriors hammered United Kingdom powerhouses Wigan and St Helens, and comfortably handled Warrington. The Warriors were knocked out in the Semi Finals by eventual winners Brisbane, going down 16ÿ22.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first season of the reformed competition was a year that saw few highlights for the club. It was readily apparent that the club needed a new approach and attitude. Fortunately for them, they were in a better position than the other two clubs that joined the competition in 1995.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer Kiwi Mark Graham took over as coach in 1999. The club was sold off to a consortium that included ex-Kiwi coach Graham Lowe and the Tainui tribe. The club again disappointed on field, but a mid season ultimatum saw a strong finish to the season, with the side winning five of their last six games. The signs appeared promising for the new millennium.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn National Rugby League season 2000 the Warriors could only finish second last. This season included the Warriors' largest ever loss in their history to date, 54ÿ0 to the Dragons in Wollongong. Alarmingly, the problems off-field overshadowed the on-field problems. The majority shareholders were under intense financial pressure, and the club's future was looking bleak at best. The key assets of the club were purchased by business tycoon Eric Watson. This did not include player contracts, and many players were released and had to fight to get the money they had been promised. Ultimately only 10 players from the 2000 season were retained.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club was re-branded as the New Zealand Warriors, with new colours of black and grey ÿ resembling the national sporting colours. New coach Daniel Anderson and CEO Mick Watson focused on signing unknown New Zealand talent. There were only six Australians in the 2001 squad, and only three foundation players ÿ Monty Betham, Stacey Jones and Logan Swann.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a season where the re-branded New Zealand Warriors were tipped to finish in second-last place behind the North Queensland Cowboys, the team surprised all, qualifying for their first ever finals appearance in the National Rugby League season 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors were involved in Round 8 in one of the biggest near-comebacks in the history of the NRL. Down 24ÿ8 to the Bulldogs with under six minutes remaining, the Warriors rattled off three tries in as many sets, only failing to win the match as ironically Stacey Jones missed his easiest kick of the night in the final minute.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a mid season struggle, the Warriors upset the runaway minor premiers Parramatta 29ÿ18 at home, in what was a highlight match.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, with their season on the line, the team won four matches in a row, starting with impressive 34ÿ8, 30ÿ0, and 14ÿ8 home victories over fellow finals-bound teams the Bulldogs, Sharks and Roosters. The Warriors also scored 24 unanswered points in the final quarter to beat the Panthers 48ÿ32. Their first finals appearance was sealed with a bruising 24ÿ24 draw with the Storm at Colonial Stadium (now Etihad Stadium), but the effects of this bruising match was seen a week later, as the Warriors were beaten by 30ÿ18 at home by the Cowboys, a win that saw the North Queenslanders avoiding the wooden spoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a hiding to nothing heading into their first ever finals appearance, they were hammered by the Minor Premiers, the Parramatta Eels 56ÿ12. The loss was at the time the largest in finals series history, but at last things seemed to be going in the right direction at the Warriors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors reached their zenith to date in the National Rugby League season 2002. They won the Minor Premiership, finishing in first place at the conclusion of the regular season after the Bulldogs lost 37 competition points late in the season due to severe salary cap breaches. The club played what stands as the first finals match to have been held outside Australia at Mt Smart Stadium in the first week of the Finals Series. The Warriors would defeat their bogey side Canberra 36ÿ20 after surviving an early scare.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Preliminary Final against the Sharks at Telstra Stadium the Warriors' sponsors, such as Vodafone New Zealand and Eric Watson, purchased 15,000 tickets and gave them away for free to anyone with a New Zealand passport. Reportedly, in the 45,000 crowd there were more Warriors supporters than Sharks supporters ÿ astonishing considering the Sharks are a Sydney-based club. The Warriors went on to win 16ÿ10 with John Carlaw scoring a famous try after latching onto a pinpoint Stacey Jones grubber-kick.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Final against the Sydney Roosters was a tight match for the first hour. The Warriors trailed 2ÿ6 at half time, but took a lead just after halftime when Jones scored a great grand final try ÿ as he left defenders sprawling in his wake on a 40-metre run to the try line. The Roosters ran away with the match in the final 20 minutes after captain Brad Fittler was involved in a head clash with Warriors prop Richard Villasanti. The final score was an unflattering 8ÿ30.\\r\\n\\r\\n2003 was another quite successful year for the Warriors.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter blowing an early 16ÿ0 lead to lose 26ÿ36 to the Newcastle Knights in Round 1, the Warriors embarked on a five-match winning streak to announce themselves as contenders for the season. However, the Warriors then struggled through the middle-stages of the season, squandering a 26ÿ12 lead with eight minutes remaining to lose to the Parramatta Eels dramatically 28ÿ26 at Parramatta Stadium. There was also an insipid 10ÿ30 loss in Townsville to the North Queensland. They played their first ever extra time match, defeating South Sydney 31ÿ30, recovering from a 6ÿ24 deficit.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the back of inspired play by prop Richard Villasanti, the Warriors secured their playoff spot, ultimately finishing sixth on points differential, a dangerous position to finish, as the 6th-placed finishers had been eliminated after the first week of the playoffs in the past three seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first finals match was against the Bulldogs at the Sydney Showground (now Spotless Stadium). The Warriors turned on one of their finest performances ever, stunning the Bulldogs early to lead 16ÿ4 at halftime, and after a Bulldogs comeback tied the scores at 16-all, scoring five tries in 16 minutes to blow the Bulldogs away, eventually winning 48ÿ22. Winger Francis Meli scored five tries, a finals record. This prompted Graham Lowe, a known critic of the Warriors to say that the Warriors would win the premiership. The next week a Stacey Jones field-goal in the dying minutes got the Warriors past a gallant Canberra Raiders 17ÿ16. They however lost in the Preliminary Final to the Minor Premiers and eventual Premiers Penrith Panthers, 20ÿ28. It was a disappointing loss for the Warriors, who did not lead at any point of the match, and blew their chance early in the second half to take their first lead, when Henry Fa'afili lost the ball with the line wide open.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the National Rugby League season 2004 started, there were predictions of the Warriors having a highly successful season. These were proved wrong, as the Warriors managed to only win six games to finish equal last, only escaping the wooden spoon by having a superior points differential to South Sydney. Coach Daniel Anderson resigned mid-season after an embarrassing 52-point loss to the Sydney Roosters. His assistant Tony Kemp was given the head coach position, and in his first game in charge the Warriors recorded an emotional 20ÿ14 win over Canberra. A week later, the Warriors' first match in Christchurch since 1996 was a flop, as the Warriors were destroyed by the Wests Tigers 4ÿ50. The season finished with an embarrassing six-game losing streak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe management looked to rescue a poor year with some high-profile signings. Bulldogs captain Steve Price was signed, as was Kiwis captain Ruben Wiki, Cowboys half Nathan Fien and Roosters winger Todd Byrne.\\r\\n\\r\\n2005 was an improvement over the horror scenes of 2004. The team remained competitive for all of their matches, and their largest loss was only 18 points. The team had a good chance to make the finals, however a four match losing streak late in the season removed those chances. The season was tinged with sadness, as it was announced it would be star halfback Stacey Jones last season with the club before he would join French Super League club, Catalans Dragons. His last match for the team against Manly at Brookvale Oval was a fine way for him to sign off with the club as he scored the match-winning try with three minutes to go in a 22ÿ20 victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the season the structure of the team was reviewed. CEO Mick Watson resigned and was replaced by Wayne Scurrah. Tony Kemp was sacked as coach and his assistant Ivan Cleary replaced him as head coach.\\r\\n\\r\\nNational Rugby League season 2006 got off to a bad start for the club. In February, the Warriors were found to have committed major breaches of the salary cap in 2005. This followed the high-profile signings of Steve Price and Ruben Wiki. On 27 February the NRL announced the club would be deducted four competition points and the club would also be fined A$430,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before the penalty the Warriors were expected to struggle and were being picked as wooden spooners in some quarters. With the four point deduction, the Warriors won their first NRL game away from Auckland, with a 26ÿ10 victory over the reigning premiers, the Wests Tigers, at Jade Stadium in Christchurch.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 June the Warriors recorded their largest ever win, defeating South Sydney 66ÿ0 at Telstra Stadium, as part of a four-match winning streak that claimed the scalps of the Sydney Roosters, Newcastle Knights, and also the Penrith Panthers. This streak was ended in an 18ÿ22 golden-point loss to the Bulldogs, in a game where the Warriors surrendered an early 16ÿ0 lead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors finished the season on a positive note leaving room for optimism for 2007 and beyond. They caused arguably the upset of the season, defeating the Minor Premiers Melbourne 24ÿ20 at Olympic Park Stadium in Melbourne, preventing the Storm from going the full regular season unbeaten at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpressively, it took the Warriors 24 weeks to be completely out of finals contention. The Warriors finished winning eight of their final twelve games, including a 42ÿ16 thrashing of the Roosters in Round 25, which included four tries by Jerome Ropati. Had the Warriors not suffered the four-point deduction, they would have finished in eighth place on the ladder, and hence would have taken part in the finals series. As it was, they finished tenth on the ladder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were a number of revelations in the squad. Unheralded halfback Grant Rovelli was a standout performer. Winger Patrick Ah Van has cemented a first grade spot and impressed many with his performances, while George Gatis and Nathan Fien were fine performers at hooker, and centre Simon Mannering has been one of the Warriors most impressive backs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors completed their pre-season with two wins from three games, defeating the Auckland Lions 64ÿ4, losing to the North Queensland Cowboys 32ÿ14 and defeating the Canterbury Bulldogs 36ÿ6.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors finished the 2007 season in fourth place. The season began with a 34ÿ18 victory over Parramatta at Mt Smart Stadium. The following week the side created history by winning their first two games of the season with a 24ÿ14 victory over premiers, the Brisbane Broncos ÿ the first time they have ever won their opening two games of the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a good start which saw the team sitting in fourth place with a 4ÿ2 win-loss record, the team hit a period of indifferent form, falling into a six match losing streak following a last minute win over South Sydney. The team returned to form, defeating Cronulla 12ÿ2 in wild weather at Toyota Park. Following that victory the side won 9 out of 12 games, with one draw. The Warriors clinched a playoff spot with a 36ÿ14 win over an understrength Manly side, and claimed a home final the following week, defeating the Penrith Panthers 24ÿ20 at CUA Stadium in Round 25.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors, by virtue of finishing the regular season in fourth place, won the right to host one of the finals matches in the first week of the playoffs. However, the Warriors narrowly went down to the Parramatta Eels 12ÿ10 at Mount Smart Stadium, and their season ended with an awful 12ÿ49 loss to the Cowboys in Townsville.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 May the Warriors signed Australian Kangaroos' centre, Brent Tate from 2008 to 2010 in what was described as a \\"major coup\\" for the New Zealand club.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2008 season did not start as brightly for the club, losing Wade McKinnon for much of the year during a pre-season loss to Newcastle, and losing captain Steve Price (rugby league) for ten weeks, as well as injuries to other key players Manu Vatuvei, Jerome Ropati and Michael Witt. The team remained in contention for much of the season, however often performed very poorly away from Mt Smart Stadium, and suffered their first loss to South Sydney (28ÿ35) since 1999, and went on to lose to the Rabbitohs again later in the season (16ÿ18). Despite poor results away, strong home form and a now common revival in the second half of the season saw the Warriors make the top eight for the second season running, incredibly despite spending only three weeks in the top eight all season. A top-eight berth was secured in the last game of the season, when the Warriors defeated the Parramatta Eels 28ÿ6 at Parramatta Stadium, marking the first time since 1995 that the Warriors had won away to Parramatta.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith nothing to lose in the first week of the finals, the Warriors caused arguably the greatest finals upset ever, and arguably greatest victory in the history of the club, defeating the Melbourne Storm 18ÿ15 at Olympic Park; in doing so, they became the first 8th placed team to beat the minor premiers, with Michael Witt scoring two minutes from full-time to clinch the win. Witt taunted Melbourne captain, Cameron Smith, before placing the ball for the historic victory.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn week two of the playoffs, the Warriors came from behind to defeat the Sydney Roosters 30ÿ13 at Mt. Smart Stadium. The Roosters led 13ÿ6 at halftime before a second-half comeback saw the Warriors pile on twenty-four unanswered points to earn the Warriors a place in the preliminary finals. This was the first time since 2003 that the Warriors have reached the grand final qualifier, and third overall in 14 seasons. They however went down heavily to an inspired Manly Sea Eagles 32ÿ6.\\r\\n\\r\\n2009 started with the loss of young up-and-comer Sonny Fai, who tragically drowned at Bethells Beach, near Auckland. He had gone into dangerous surf to rescue some relatives but was probably sucked under by a rip. Almost as if using the occurrence as an inhibitor, the Warriors had a very disappointing year, despite winning the opening two rounds against eventual grand finalists Parramatta Eels 26ÿ18 and reigning premiers Manly Sea Eagles.\\r\\nAfter those great wins they proceeded to win a poor 1 of 8 games including a draw.\\r\\nThey did however manage to beat West Tigers 14ÿ0 and the Knights 13ÿ0 keeping both opponents scoreless, but it was the poor attacking that had every league fan questioning. and ultimately saw them lose their next 3 matches by heavy scores. They did beat the Roosters 30ÿ24 at SFS and Raiders 34ÿ20 at Mt Smart Stadium. But in the end the Warriors lost their final two games against the Bulldogs in Hazem El Masri's last home game [before the finals] and ultimately ended their poor season in a bad way losing 0ÿ30 to the eventual premiers Melbourne Storm.\\r\\n\\r\\nExpectations were not high for the Warriors in 2010 after a disappointing 2009 season. The Warriors bolstered their playing stocks in the pivotal play-making positions by signing Brett Seymour after he was cut by Cronulla and James Maloney from Melbourne. In arguably one of their best ever performances they humbled the Brisbane Broncos 48ÿ16 at Suncorp Stadium in Round 3, with Maloney tying a club-record with 28 points (3 tries and 8 goals). Kevin Locke scored a hat-trick in the Warriors miraculous 20ÿ18 win over the Sydney Roosters at AMI Stadium in Christchurch, narrowly escaping a serious hip injury after a high-speed collision with the goal-post (in the process of scoring the game-winning try). The Warriors won five matches in a row for the first time since late in the 2003 season and finished in 5th position in the regular season. They were knocked out of the finals series in the first week, losing to Gold Coast Titans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors began the 2011 season with an historic match at Auckland's Eden Park, the first regular season home game the club had played away from Mt Smart Stadium. The match drew a record home game crowd for the Warriors of 38,405 however unfortunately the Warriors could not repay the large crowd with a victory as they were beaten 24ÿ18 by the Parramatta Eels. The Warriors went on to lose their following two matches and it appeared that Warriors fans were in for another season of disappointment. To their credit the Warriors bounced back and were in the running for a top four position late in the season but finished in 6th spot. Midway through the season coach Ivan Cleary was approached by the Penrith Panthers and was appointed as their coach for the 2012 season. Cleary remained coach for the remainder of the 2011 season and Brian McClennan was to be appointed his successor for the 2012 season. One of the highlights of the season was the unearthing of the young halfback Shaun Johnson who played a key role as the Warriors approached the 2011 finals series.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn week one of the finals series the Warriors were thrashed 40ÿ10 by the Brisbane Broncos. Other results went the Warriors way and they were fortunate to progress to week two of the finals where they would meet a high flying Wests Tigers who had completed their 9th straight victory. The match was expected to go the Tigers way however a brilliant second half comeback by the Warriors culminated in a late and controversial try to Krisnan Inu which saw the Warriors win 22ÿ20 and earn the right to play the Melbourne Storm for a place in the Grand Final.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors traveled to Melbourne as heavy underdogs but turned in what is considered one of the most complete performances in the club's history. The Warriors controlled the match and sealed the Melbourne Storm's fate with Shaun Johnson mesmerising the Storm defence to send Lewis Brown in for the try that would send the Warriors to their second ever Grand Final, where they would meet the Manly Sea Eagles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors would again start the match as heavy underdogs and with a side boasting only three players who had previously played in a Grand Final (Manly on the other hand could boast their coach and eight players who had won the 2008 NRL premiership with the club, plus another who had won a premiership in 2003 with Penrith). Heavy defence from both sides was the feature until the Warriors opened the scoring with a penalty goal to James Maloney in the 28th minute, but a little more than a minute after the restart, a bad read in defence saw prolific try scorer Brett Stewart in for the 1st try. Just before the break, the Warriors were then unlucky not to receive a penalty for obstruction in the lead up to Manly's second try which saw them go into the sheds down 12ÿ2. A further try to Clive Churchill Medal winner Glenn Stewart in the 57th minute saw Manly's lead out to 18ÿ2. The Warriors refused to die however, and clawed their way back with tries to Manu Vatuvei and Elijah Taylor in the 63rd and 68th minutes. Unfortunately Maloney missed both conversions which could have taken the score to 18ÿ14 and a grandstand finish, but a try to Manly captain Jamie Lyon with only a minute remaining put the result beyond doubt as the Warriors were beaten by a clinical Manly outfit 24ÿ10 ÿ yet their effort in reaching just their second ever Grand Final (and their first in nine years) was a triumph for the club and departing coach Ivan Cleary and won praise from those in the NRL.\\r\\n\\r\\n2011 was a successful season all-round for the New Zealand Warriors, with all three grades reaching the Grand Final. The clubs NYC team defeated the North Queensland Cowboys 31ÿ30 in golden point extra time in the NYC Grand Final to win their second premiership, while NSW Cup affiliate the Auckland Vulcans went down 30ÿ28 after conceding a last minute try to Canterbury-Bankstown in the NSW Cup Grand Final.\\r\\n\\r\\n2012 was meant to promise so much for the Warriors following their grand final appearance of 2011. A new coach with a successful track record in Brian 'Bluey' McClennan, a stable squad and strong public support indicated that 2012 could have been the year they finally broke their premiership duck. The season again kicked off with a home game at Eden Park, with a strong crowd of 37,502 witnessing the Warriors go down 20ÿ26 to Manly in a grand final rematch. The match was perhaps an indication of things to come, with the Warriors performing strongly on attack but being let down by weak defence at crucial stages which ultimately cost them the match.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe season did not improve much from that point, with the Warriors failing to find any semblance of consistency throughout the season. There were some highs, such as their 44ÿ22 drubbing of the Rabbitohs, but these were far outweighed by the deep lows. Their season is best summed up by a dismal month of football between Rounds 20 and 23. The Warriors surrendered 19- and 18-nil leads in succession and lost (a first in the history of the game), before leaking 97 points in their next two defeats. In the process they lost all semblance of a quality rugby league team.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nInjuries were not kind to the Warriors, with the side using 29 players over the course of the season ÿ the second highest of any team in the NRL. The Warriors season unravelled over the latter rounds. Ultimately Brian McClennan was sacked with three rounds remaining, with assistant coach Tony Iro taking over the reins for the final two rounds. The change of coach did not result in a change of fortunes however, as the Warriors limped out of the season with an eight match long losing streak ÿ a club record.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing a lengthy search for a new coach former Penrith and Canberra boss Matthew Elliot was appointed as head coach in October 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother horror start for the Warriors in 2013 as they win just 2 of their opening 10 games. The Warriors came back into finals contention winning 7 games out of 8 including a 56ÿ18 win against the Brisbane Broncos in Brisbane. As finals approached the Warriors ended with just 2 wins from their remaining 6 games to see them finish the season 11th. In Round 10, on 18 May the Warriors lost 6ÿ62 to the Penrith Panthers which was their largest ever loss in the club's history. Captain Simon Mannering won the club's Player of the year and Ngani Laumape won Rookie of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the First edition of the NRL Auckland Nines, The Warriors were favourites to win. They finished top of their pool winning all three games but lost the Semi Final to eventual winners North Queensland Cowboys. The Warriors started the season two wins and two loses but in Round 5 after a 37ÿ6 lost to Cronulla Sutherland Sharks the club sacked head coach Matthew Elliott replacing him former Canberra Raiders player Andrew McFadden. Unfortunately the Warriors missed the playoffs for the 3rd season in a row after missing out on points difference to the Brisbane Broncos. Simon Mannering won his 4th Player of the year award, while David Fusitu'a won Rookie of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the Warriors 20th season in the NRL.\\r\\n\\r\\nWarriors ended the season with 8 consecutive loses after Shaun Johnson broke his ankle against Manly Sea Eagles in Round 20. Warriors were knocked out in the Quarter Finals of the 2015 NRL Auckland Nines by eventual runners up Cronulla Sutherland Sharks. Ben Matulino was named club Player of the year with Tuimoala Lolohea named clubs Rookie of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo start off, there was plenty of hype around the Warriors camp about 2016 being the season where they would finally win the Premiership, after the major signings of 2015 Dally M Fullback of the Year Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, from the Sydney Roosters and Kiwi international Issac Luke, from the South Sydney Rabbitohs. The Warriors came runners up in the 2016 NRL Auckland Nines, losing to the Parramatta Eels in the final, 22ÿ4. The Warriors started the season in the worst possible way, losing their first three matches. The Warriors beat the Newcastle Knights 40ÿ18 to record their first win of the season and then defeated the Sydney Roosters in a Golden Point thriller in Gosford a week later. After the embarrassing loss to Melbourne Storm on Anzac Day, the team came under intense scrutiny with many calling for the sacking of coach, Andrew McFadden. As well as this, six Warriors players where stood down after mixing prescription drugs with energy drinks. This scandal did not help the club who were already struggling. After 11 rounds, the Warriors stood at four wins from 11 games. As State of Origin came into effect, the Warriors started to elevate their performance. Winning four from five games, with the exception being a golden point loss to the table-topping Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. After Round 18, the Warriors were in the top eight and needing only to win four out of their final eight games with three of their final four games on home turf. An achievable target, however the club recorded just two wins from their final eight games to finish tenth on the ladder and for the fifth year in a row, missed out on finals. Simon Mannering received his fifth Warriors Player of the Year, with Nathaniel Roache receiving Rookie of the Year. On 12 September 2016 it was announced that Kiwis coach Stephen Kearney would replace Andrew McFadden as head coach for 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the restructuring of the Warriors coaching staff and with the signing of Kieran Foran, there was much anticipation leading into the season for the team. The Auckland Nines were perhaps a sign of things to come as the Warriors were left win-less and at the bottom of their pool. They kicked off the regular season with a narrow victory over the Newcastle Knights. It would be one of few wins for the 2017 season. Heading into their first bye of the season, they had just won six from 14 games. Worse was yet to come. After that bye, they defeated the Canterbury Bulldogs at Mt Smart Stadium in what would turn out to be their last win of the season. After that, the Warriors would go on a losing streak until the season's end, creating a club record of nine straight losses and one of the worst seasons in the clubs history. As well as this, notable names such as Ryan Hoffman, Jacob Lillyman, Charlie Gubb and Kieran Foran had left the club. After so much promise and hype leading up to the championship, it seemed to have been all too familiar for Warriors fans. So much so, during a school visit in September, after their season had ended, one student asked them why they were \\"so bad\\", while another, who had little knowledge of rugby league, asked them where they finished on the competition ladder.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2017, the New Zealand Warriors expressed their interest in applying for a licence to participate in the inaugural NRL Women's season.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nHead coach\\r\\n\\r\\nAssistant coaches\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated: 16 July 2018Source(s): [1]\\r\\n\\r\\n1995ÿ2017\\r\\n\\r\\n1995ÿ1996\\r\\n\\r\\n1997ÿ1999\\r\\n\\r\\n2000\\r\\n\\r\\n2001ÿ2002\\r\\n\\r\\n2003ÿ2005\\r\\n\\r\\n2006ÿ2008\\r\\n\\r\\n2009ÿ2011\\r\\n\\r\\n2012ÿ\\r\\n\\r\\n* indicates player still active.\\r\\n\\r\\n1995ÿ2014\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovered from a 20-point deficit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurrendered a 26-point lead.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurrendered an 18-point lead (three-times).\\r\\n\\r\\nSurrendered a 16-point lead (three-times).\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayed 12: Won 4, Lost 5, Drawn 3\\r\\n\\r\\nLargest attendances at the four venues used as home grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2017, the New Zealand Warriors expressed their interest in applying for a licence to participate in the inaugural NRL Women's Premiership.[11] In March 2018, they were awarded one of four licences for the league's inaugural season, to commence in September of the same year.[12] Luisa Avaiki will coach the side.","input":"Who is the longest serving coach of the vodafone warriors?"},{"output":"five claws","context":"Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni ) is one of five tortoise species traditionally placed in the genus Testudo, the others being the marginated tortoise (T. marginata), Greek tortoise (T. graeca, or common tortoise), Russian tortoise (T. horsfieldii ), and Kleinmann's tortoise (T. kleinmanni, or Egyptian tortoise). Two subspecies are known: the western Hermann's tortoise (T. h. hermanni ) and the eastern Hermann's tortoise (T. h. boettgeri ). Sometimes mentioned as a subspecies, T. h. peleponnesica is not yet confirmed to be genetically different from T. h. boettgeri.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe specific epithet, hermanni, honors French naturalist Johann Hermann.[3]\\r\\nThe subspecific name, boettgeri, honors German herpetologist Oskar Boettger.[3]\\r\\nTestudo hermanni can be found throughout southern Europe. The western population (T. h. hermanni ) is found in eastern Spain, southern France, the Balearic islands, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, south and central Italy (Tuscany). The eastern population (T. h. boettgeri ) inhabits Serbia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Turkey and Greece, while T. h. hercegovinensis populates the coasts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Montenegro.\\r\\nHermann's tortoises are small to medium-sized tortoises from southern Europe. Young animals and some adults have attractive black and yellow-patterned carapaces, although the brightness may fade with age to a less distinct gray, straw, or yellow coloration. They have slightly hooked upper jaws and, like other tortoises, possess no teeth,[4] just strong, horny beaks.[5] Their scaly limbs are greyish to brown, with some yellow markings, and their tails bear a spur (a horny spike) at the tip.[5] Adult males have particularly long and thick tails,[6] and well-developed spurs, distinguishing them from females.[5]\\r\\nThe eastern subspecies T. h. boettgeri is much larger than the western T. h. hermanni, reaching sizes up to 28?cm (11?in) in length. A specimen of this size may weigh 3ÿ4?kg (6.6ÿ8.8?lb). T. h. hermanni rarely grows larger than 18?cm (7.1?in). Some adult specimens are as small as 7?cm (2.8?in).\\r\\nMale of T. h. hermanni\\r\\nFemale of T. h. hermanni\\r\\nFemale of T. h. boettgeri\\r\\nIn 2006, Hermann's tortoise was suggested to be moved to the genus Eurotestudo and to bring the subspecies to the rank of species (Eurotestudo hermanni and Eurotestudo boettgeri).[7] Though some factors indicate this might be correct,[8] the data at hand are not unequivocally in support and the relationships between Hermann's and the Russian tortoise among each other and to the other species placed in Testudo are not robustly determined. Hence, it seems doubtful that the new genus will be accepted for now. The elevation of the subspecies to full species was tentatively rejected under the biological species concept at least, as there still seems significant gene flow.[9]\\r\\nOf note, the rate of evolution as measured by mutations accumulating in the mtDNA differs markedly, with the eastern populations have evolved faster. This is apparently due to stronger fragmentation of the population on the mountainous Balkans during the last ice age. While this has no profound implications for taxonomy of this species, apart from suggesting that two other proposed subspecies are actually just local forms at present, it renders the use of molecular clocks in Testudo even more dubious and unreliable than they are for turtles in general.[10][11][9]\\r\\nThe subspecies T. h. hermanni includes the former subspecies T. h. robertmertensi and has a number of local forms. It has a highly arched shell with an intensive coloration, with its yellow coloration making a strong contrast to the dark patches. The colors wash out somewhat in older animals, but the intense yellow is often maintained. The underside has two connected black bands along the central seam.\\r\\nThe coloration of the head ranges from dark green to yellowish, with isolated dark patches. A particular characteristic is a yellow fleck on the cheek found in most specimens, although not in all; T. h. robertmertensi is the name of a morph with very prominent cheek spots. Generally, the forelegs have no black pigmentation on their undersides. The base of the claws is often lightly colored. The tail in males is larger than in females and possesses a spike. Generally, the shell protecting the tail is divided. A few specimens can be found with undivided shells, similar to the Greek tortoise.\\r\\nVar colouring\\r\\nApulian colouring\\r\\nSardinian colouring\\r\\nThe subspecies T. h. hercegovinensis, known as the Dalmatian tortoise,[12] (Balkans coast) and the local T. h. peloponnesica (southwestern Peloponnesus coast) are now included here; they constitute local forms that are not yet geographically or in other ways reproductively isolated and apparently, derive from relict populations of the last ice age.[9] The eastern Hermann's tortoises also have arched, almost round carapaces, but some are notably flatter and more oblong. The coloration is brownish with a yellow or greenish hue and with isolated black flecks. The coloring tends to wash out quite strongly in older animals. The underside is almost always solid horn color and has separate black patches on either side of the central seam.\\r\\nThe head is brown to black, with fine scales. The forelegs similarly possess fine scales. The limbs generally have five claws, which are darkly colored at their base. The hind legs are noticeably thicker than the forelegs, almost plump. The particularly strong tail ends in a spike, which may be very large in older male specimens. Females have noticeably smaller tail spikes, which are slightly bent toward the body.\\r\\nAdult female, Bulgaria\\r\\nFemale T. h. boettgeri (left) and T. h. hercegovinensis tail openings\\r\\nFemale T. h. peloponnesica\\r\\nEarly in the morning, the animals leave their nightly shelters, which are usually hollows protected by thick bushes or hedges, to bask in the sun and warm their bodies. They then roam about the Mediterranean meadows of their habitat in search of food. They determine which plants to eat by the sense of smell. (In captivity, they are known to eat dandelions, clover, and lettuce, as well as the leaves, flowers, and pods of almost all legumes.) In addition to leaves and flowers, the animals eat small amounts of fruits as supplementary nutrition.\\r\\nAround midday, the sun becomes too hot for the tortoises, so they return to their hiding places. They have a good sense of direction to enable them to return. Experiments have shown they also possess a good sense of time, the position of the sun, the magnetic lines of the earth, and for landmarks.[citation needed] In the late afternoon, they leave their shelters again and return to feeding.\\r\\nIn late February, Hermanns tortoises emerge from under bushes or old rotting wood, where they spend the winter months hibernating, buried in a bed of dead leaves.[5] Immediately after surfacing from their winter resting place, Hermanns tortoises commence courtship and mating.[5] Courtship is a rough affair for the female, which is pursued, rammed, and bitten by the male, before being mounted. Aggression is also seen between rival males during the breeding season, which can result in ramming contests.[6]\\r\\nBetween May and July, female Hermanns tortoises deposit between two and 12 eggs into flask-shaped nests dug into the soil,[6] up to 10?cm (3.9?in) deep.[5] Most females lay more than one clutch each season.[6] The pinkish-white eggs are incubated for around 90 days and, like many reptiles,[6] the temperature at which the eggs are incubated determines the hatchlings sex. At 26?C, only males will be produced, while at 30?C, all the hatchlings will be female.[5] Young Hermanns tortoises emerge just after the start of the heavy autumn rains in early September and spend the first four or five years of their lives within just a few metres of their nests.[6] If the rains do not come, or if nesting took place late in the year, the eggs will still hatch, but the young will remain underground and not emerge until the following spring. Until the age of six or eight, when the hard shell becomes fully developed, the young tortoises are very vulnerable to predators and may fall prey to rats, badgers, magpies, foxes, wild boar, and many other animals. If they survive these threats, the longevity of Hermanns tortoises is around 30 years.[5] One rare record of longevity is 31.7 years.[13] Compared to other tortoises (e.g. Testudo graeca),[13] the longevity might be underestimated and many sources are reporting they might live 90 years[14] or more.\\r\\nBreeding and upbringing of Hermann's tortoises are quite easy if kept in species-appropriate environments. The European Studbook Foundation maintains stud books for both subspecies. With the help of ultraviolet light-emitting bulbs (UVa and UVb, such as Repti Glo and Creature World), the correct environment for breeding can be created and bring tortoises into breeding condition.\\r\\nSeveral tortoise sanctuaries are located in Europe, such as Carapax in southern Tuscany, and Le Village Des Tortues in the south of France (near Gonfaron). These sanctuaries rescue injured tortoises whilst also taking in unwanted pets, and specialize in Hermann's tortoises.\\r\\nThe UK, with its large captive population, also has many specialist centers providing rescue facilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn nature, the animals dig their nightly shelters out and spend the relatively mild Mediterranean winters there. During this time, their heart and breathing rates drop notably. Domestic animals can be kept in the basement in a roomy rodent-proof box with a thick layer of dry leaves. The temperature should be around 5?C. As an alternative, the box can be stored in a refrigerator. For this method to be used, the refrigerator should be in regular day-to-day use, to permit air flow. During hibernation, the ambient temperature must not fall below zero. Full-grown specimens may sleep four to five months at a time.\\r\\nHermann's tortoises can mate at any time of the year. Females dig flask-shaped holes to lay their eggs in, and eggs take 90ÿ120 days to hatch. The sex of the hatchlings is determined by the incubation temperature.[15]\\r\\n12:02\\r\\n12:32\\r\\n12:42\\r\\n12:46\\r\\n14:47\\r\\nThis article incorporates text from the ARKive fact-file \\"Hermann's tortoise\\" under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License and the GFDL.","input":"How many claws does a hermann tortoise have?"},{"output":"in the Cusco area","context":"The Inca state was known as the Kingdom of Cusco before 1438. Over the course of the Inca Empire, the Inca used conquest and peaceful assimilation to incorporate in their empire a large portion of western[clarification needed], centered on the Andean mountain ranges. However, shortly after the Inca Civil War, the last Sapa Inca (emperor) of the Inca Empire was captured and killed on the orders of the conquistador Francisco Pizarro, marking the beginning of Spanish rule. The remnants of the empire retreated to the remote jungles of Vilcabamba and established the small Neo-Inca State, which was conquered by the Spanish in 1572.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Quechua name for the empire after the reforms under Pachacuti was Tawantin Suyu, which can be translated The Four Regions or The Four United Regions.  Before the Quechua spelling reform it was written in Spanish as Tahuantinsuyo.  Tawantin is a group of four things (tawa \\"four\\" with the suffix -ntin which names a group); suyu means \\"region\\" or \\"province\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe empire was divided into four suyus, whose corners met at the capital, Cuzco (Qosqo), in modern-day Peru.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official language of the empire was Quechua, although over seven hundred local languages were spoken. The Inca leadership encouraged the worship of their gods, the foremost of which was Inti, the sun god.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inca have four types of origin myths. In one, Tici Viracocha of Colina de las Ventanas in Paqariq Tampu sent forth his four sons and four daughters to establish a village. Along the way, Sinchi Roca was born to Manco and Ocllo, and Sinchi Roca is the person who finally led them to the valley of Cuzco where they founded their new village. There Manco became their leader and became known as Manco Cpac.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another origin myth, the sun god Inti ordered Manco Cpac and Mama Ocllo to emerge from the depths of Lake Titicaca and found the city of Cuzco. They traveled by means of underground caves until reaching Cuzco where they established Hurin Cuzco, or the first dynasty of the Kingdom of Cuzco.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third origin myth, an Inca sun god told his wife that he was lonely. She proposed that he create a civilization to worship him and keep him company. He saw this as a wise plan and carried it out. The Inca were born from Lake Cusco and populated the Andes and worshiped their sun god.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last origin myth, Manco Cpac, who was the son of the sun, and his sister Mama Occlo, the daughter of the moon, were sent by the sun to look for a place to build an empire. They were to tell when they were at the right place by carrying a special rod with them at all times. Wherever the rod sank into the ground, this was where they were to create a new city. The rod sank into the ground in Cuzco.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe knowledge of these myths is due to oral tradition since the Incas did not have writing. Manco Cpac, who became the leader of his tribe, probably did exist, despite lack of solid evidence. The archeological evidence seems to indicate that the Inca were a relatively unimportant tribe until the time of Sinchi Roca, also called Cinchi Roca, who is the first figure in Inca mythology whose existence can be supported historically.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inca people began as a tribe in the Cusco area around the 12th century AD. Under the leadership of Manco Cpac, they formed the small city-state of Cusco Quechua Qosqo.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1438 AD, under the command of Sapa Inca (paramount leader) Pachacuti, whose name meant \\"world-shaker\\", they began a far-reaching expansion.  The land Pachacuti conquered was about the size of the Thirteen Colonies of the United States in 1776 and consisted of about half the Andes mountain range.\\r\\n\\r\\nPachacuti reorganized the kingdom of Cusco into an empire, the Tahuantinsuyu, a federalist system which consisted of a central government with the Inca at its head and four provincial governments with strong leaders: Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW), and Qullasuyu (SE). Pachacuti is also thought to have built Machu Picchu, either as a family home or as a Camp David-like retreat[citation needed].\\r\\n\\r\\nPachacuti would send spies to regions he wanted in his empire who would report back on their political organization, military might and wealth. He would then send messages to the leaders of these lands extolling the benefits of joining his empire, offering them presents of luxury goods such as high-quality textiles, and promising that they would be materially richer as subject rulers of the Inca. Most accepted the rule of the Inca as a fait accompli and acquiesced peacefully. The ruler's children would then be brought to Cuzco to be taught about Inca administration systems, then return to rule their native lands. This allowed the Inca to indoctrinate the former ruler's children into the Inca nobility, and, with luck, marry their daughters into families at various corners of the empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was traditional for the Inca's son to lead the army; Pachacuti's son T~pac Inca began conquests to the north in 1463 and continued them as Inca after Pachucuti's death in 1471.  His most important conquest was the Kingdom of Chimor, the Inca's only serious rival for the coast of Peru. T~pac Inca's empire stretched north into modern-day Ecuador and Colombia.\\r\\n\\r\\nT~pac Inca's son Huayna Cpac added significant territory to the south.  At its height, Tahuantinsuyu included Peru and Bolivia, most of what is now Ecuador, a large portion of modern-day Chile, and extended into corners of Argentina and Colombia.\\r\\nTahuantinsuyu was a patchwork of languages, cultures, and peoples. The components of the empire were not all uniformly loyal, nor were the local cultures all fully integrated. The portions of the Chachapoya that had been conquered were almost openly hostile to the Inca, and the Inca nobles rejected an offer of refuge in their kingdom after their troubles with the Spanish. For instance, the Chim~ used money in their commerce, while the Inca empire as a whole had an economy based on exchange and taxation of luxury goods and labour (it is said that Inca tax collectors would take the head lice of the lame and old as a symbolic tribute).\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomic productivity was based on collective labor which was organized in order to benefit the whole community. The ayni was used to help individual members of the community in need, such as a sick member of the community. The Minka or teamwork represented community service and the Mita was the tax paid to the Inca in the form of labor. The Inca did not use currency, economic exchanges were by reciprocity and took place in markets called catus.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpanish conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro explored south from Panama, reaching Inca territory by 1526. It was clear that they had reached a wealthy land with prospects of great treasure, and after one more expedition (1529), Pizarro traveled to Spain and received royal approval to conquer the region and be its viceroy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time they returned to Peru, in 1532, a war of succession between Huayna Capac's sons Huscar and Atahualpa and unrest among newly conquered territoriesand perhaps more importantly, smallpox, which had spread from Central Americahad considerably weakened the empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nPizarro did not have a formidable force; with just 170 men, 1 cannon and only 27 horses, he often needed to talk his way out of potential confrontations that could have easily wiped out his party.  Their first engagement was the battle of Pun, near present-day Guayaquil, Ecuador; Pizarro then founded the city of Piura in July 1532. Hernando de Soto was sent inland to explore the interior, and returned with an invitation to meet the Inca, Atahualpa, who had defeated his brother in the civil war and was resting at Cajamarca with his army of 80,000 troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nPizarro met with the Inca, who had brought only a small retinue, and through interpreters demanded that he convert to Christianity. A widely disputed legend claims that Atahualpa was handed a Bible and threw it on the floor, the Spanish supposedly interpreted this action as adequate reason for war. Though some chroniclers suggest that Atahualpa simply didn't understand the notion of a book, others portray Atahualpa as being genuinely curious and inquisitive in the situation. Regardless,  The Spanish attacked the Inca's retinue (see Battle of Cajamarca), capturing Atahualpa.\\r\\n\\r\\nPizarro used the capture to gain gold as a ransom. Atahualpa offered the Spaniards enough gold to fill the room he was imprisoned in, and twice that amount of silver. The Incas fulfilled this ransom. Over four months, almost 8 tons of gold was collected. Pizarro was supposed to let the ruler of the Incas free once the ransom was paid, but he refused to release the Inca after that and instead had him strangled in public. During Atahualpa's imprisonment Huscar was assassinated. The Spanish maintained that this was at Atahualpa's orders; this was one of the charges used against Atahualpa when the Spanish finally decided to put him to death, in August 1533.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spanish installed his brother Manco Inca Yupanqui in power; for some time Manco cooperated with the Spanish, while the Spanish fought to put down resistance in the north.  Meanwhile, an associate of Pizarro's, Diego de Almagro, attempted to claim Cusco for himself.  Manco tried to use this intra-Spanish feud to his advantage, recapturing Cusco (1536), but the Spanish retook the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nManco Inca then retreated to the mountains of Vilcabamba and founded the Neo-Inca State, where he and his successors ruled for another 36 years, sometimes raiding the Spanish or inciting revolts against them.  In 1572 the last Inca stronghold was discovered, and the last ruler, T~pac Amaru, Manco's son, was captured and executed, bringing the Inca empire to an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the fall of Tahuantinsuyu, the new Spanish rulers repressed the people and their traditions. Many aspects of Inca culture were systematically destroyed, including their sophisticated farming system.  The Spanish used the Inca mita (mandatory public service) system to get labourers for mines and plantations.  One member of each family was forced to work in the gold and silver mines, the foremost of which was the silver mine at Potos.  When one family member died, which would usually happen within a year or two, the family would be required to send a replacement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major languages of the empire, Quechua and Aymara, were employed by the Catholic Church to evangelize in the Andean region.

The eight lane bridge satisfied the capacity of U.S. Route 17 when it opened in 2005 to replace two obsolete cantilever truss bridges. The bridge has a main span of 1,546 feet (471 m), the third longest among cable-stayed bridges in the Western Hemisphere. It was built using the design-build method and was designed by Parsons Brinckerhoff.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first bridge to cross the lower Cooper River opened in 1929, eventually named the John P. Grace Memorial Bridge for former Charleston mayor John P. Grace, who spearheaded the project. The main span of the double cantilever truss bridge was the fifth longest in the world at 1,050 feet (320 m) and soared 150 feet (46 m) above the river. The main span of the second cantilever was the twelfth-longest in the world. The total length of the structure was about 2.7 miles (4.3?km). Following a 17-month construction at a cost of $6 million, it opened with a 3-day celebration that attracted visitors from around the globe. Engineers and critics proclaimed colorful descriptions of the unique structure, deeming it \\"the first roller-coaster bridge\\" and citing that \\"steep approaches, stupendous height, extremely narrow width, and a sharp curve at the dip conspire to excite and alarm the motorist.\\"  Privately owned originally, a $1.00 toll was charged for car and driver to cross. In 1943 the state of South Carolina purchased the bridge, and the tolls were lifted in 1946.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 1960s the Grace Memorial Bridge had become insufficient, with its two narrow 10-foot (3 m) lanes built for Ford Model As and its steep grades of up to 6 percent. Later changes to the side rail and curb reduced the lane width further.[citation needed] A new bridge was constructed alongside and parallel to it. Named for the then-South Carolina Highway Commissioner, the Silas N. Pearman Bridge opened in 1966 at cost of $15 million. Its three lanes, at a modern 12-foot (3.7 m) width, opened to northbound traffic while its older counterpart carried the southbound traffic into downtown Charleston. One lane was reversible on the Pearman bridge, which led to signs warning \\"Use lanes with green arrow\\" and \\"Do not use red X lane\\" on the bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two truss bridges had become functionally obsolete by 1979. Extensive metal deterioration caused by the lack of maintenance shortly after Grace Bridge's tolls were removed limited the capacity of the older Grace bridge to ten ton vehicles (later five tons), and the reversible lane on the Pearman was eliminated (it had been able to switch to three lanes northbound for rush hour traffic), making that lane southbound permanently, diverting all heavy trucks, buses, and recreational vehicles to that lane on the Pearman bridge. Neither of the bridges had emergency lanes, and the Pearman bridge had no median between the northbound and southbound lanes because of its reversible lane, and it was not until 2002 when flexible barriers were added to the Pearman bridge to prevent head-on collisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, the vertical clearance above the river ÿ once among the highest in the world ÿ could no longer accommodate modern shipping vessels. Three of Charlestons four shipping terminals are situated up the Cooper and Wando Rivers, and the limited bridge clearance excluded the access of ships that would otherwise be beneficial to the economy of South Carolina. Now that the old bridges are disassembled, the worlds largest modern container ships are able to access all terminals of the nation's fourth-largest container port.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaising financial support for a new eight-lane bridge over the Cooper River was a struggle 20 years in the making, prolonged by the state's insistence that it could not afford such a bridge and by Charleston's reluctance to provide any funds for the project. Several proposals were made for a toll bridge, but the mayors of Charleston and Mount Pleasant objected. When officials revealed in 1995 that the Grace Bridge scored a 4 out of 100 for safety and integrity, retired U.S. Congressman Arthur Ravenel Jr. ran for the South Carolina Senate with a goal of solving the funding problem. He helped to establish the S.C. Infrastructure Bank and worked with local, state, and federal officials to create partnerships that helped to materialize the final funding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) budgeted $325 million to accompany $96.6 million from the Federal Highway Administration. The project did not become a reality, however, until the SIB agreed to commit to a $215 million federal loan, provided that Charleston County would contribute $3 million a year for 25 years, including an 8.33% sales tax increase, to the federal loan, as well as yearly payments from the SCDOT and State Ports Authority. The overall price of the bridge totaled around $700 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to his efforts in passing laws for the new bridge's funding, fellow lawmakers voted to name bridge the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge.  Some felt that the bridge should not be named after Ravenel, with the head of the South Carolina infrastructure bank saying in 1999, \\"Certainly, Arthur Ravenel is a fine, decent person, but that bridge is bigger than any one individual and it should reflect all the qualities of the state and not some state senator who happens to be in the Legislature the time the structure is being built.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlestons new bridge over the Cooper River is a cable-stayed suspension design with two diamond-shaped towers, each 575 feet (175 m) high. The total length of the structure is 13,200 feet (4.0?km), with the main span stretching 1,546 feet (471 m) between the towers. 128 individual cables anchored to the inside of the diamond towers suspend the deck 186 feet (57 m) above the river. The roadway consists of eight 12-foot (3.7 m) lanes, four in each direction as well as a 12-foot (3.7?m) bicycle and pedestrian path to the design, which runs along the south edge of the bridge overlooking Charleston Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge superstructure is designed to withstand shipping accidents and the natural disasters that have plagued Charlestons history. The span is designed to endure wind gusts in excess of 300?mph (480?km/h), far stronger than those of the worst storm in Charleston's history, Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Engineers also considered the 1886 earthquake that nearly leveled Charleston. The Ravenel Bridge is designed to withstand an earthquake of approximately 7.4 on the Richter magnitude scale without total failure. To protect the bridge from errant ships, the towers are flanked by one-acre rock islands. Ships will run aground on the islands before colliding with the towers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge includes a shared bicycle-pedestrian path named Wonders' Way in memory of Garrett Wonders. Wonders was a US Navy ensign stationed in Charleston and was in training for the 2004 Olympics before he died in a bicycle-vehicle collision.[4] The path was included in design of the new bridge because of grassroots efforts by groups such as a fifth grade class at a local elementary school.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nGroundbreaking on the bridge occurred in 2001 in Mount Pleasant. The bridge was built as a design-build project, meaning that one contract was signed to both design and construct the bridge. This meant that construction could begin even while the design was not yet finalized. The bridge was built by a joint venture of two major construction firms operating under the name Palmetto Bridge Constructors. The joint venture partners were Tidewater Skanska of Norfolk, Virginia and Flatiron Constructors of Longmont, Colorado. The construction joint venture hired Parsons Brinckerhoff to complete the design. For the sake of simplifying labor and equipment resources, Palmetto Bridge Constructors actually managed the building of the bridge as five separate projects (the two highway interchanges at either end of the bridge, the two approach spans, and the cable-stayed span) going on simultaneously.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the summer of 2002 the foundations for the towers and most of the piers were in place and the rock islands were completed. The steel and concrete towers began to ascend from the islands soon after. Originally, each of the towers was to be topped with a 50-foot (15?m) multicolored LED \\"beacon,\\" but public opinion caused this plan to be scrapped.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fast-paced construction schedule led to contractors to use a self-climbing form system to build the towers. The formwork, supplied by PERI, provided a solution to meet the tight construction tolerances and provide safe access for workers laboring hundreds of feet in the air. The self-climbing system meant that the tower cranes did not have to spend time raising the forms after each segment of concrete hardened, and instead could be better used to haul material from barges below.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first cables were hung from the towers in 2004as a time-saving measure, this was done before the towers were wholly completed. Sections of the deck were built outward from each of the towers as more cables were hung.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe decks of the approaches were taking shape as well. Construction of part of the roadway actually occurred over the top of the old cantilever bridges, which remained open to traffic without interruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nA ceremony was held in March 2005, when the last slab of the deck was added, thus making the bridge \\"complete.\\"  But paving, installation of lights and signs, and cleanup meant that the bridge would not open for another four months.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing a week-long celebration that included a public bridge walk, concerts, dinners, and fireworks, the bridge was dedicated and opened on July 16, 2005 ÿ one year ahead of schedule and under budget. The bridge was featured on the TV show Extreme Engineering.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proximity and rivalry between Charleston, South Carolina and Savannah and Brunswick often lead to comparisons between the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, the Sidney Lanier Bridge, and the Talmadge Memorial Bridge, all of which carry US 17.[citation needed]  Completed in 2005, the clearance under the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is actually only 1 foot (0.30?m) taller than both the Sidney Lanier Bridge and the Talmadge Memorial Bridge. Unlike the Sidney Lanier Bridge and the Talmadge Memorial Bridge, however, the Ravenel Bridge has eight travel lanes; the Talmadge and the Sidney Lanier both have just four lanes. The Ravenel also features a dedicated bike/pedestrian lane. The Talmadge Memorial Bridge also has a similar design as the Alex Fraser Bridge in Vancouver, Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the span of the three bridges, The Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is 1,546 feet (471?m). The Sidney Lanier Bridge is 1,250 feet (380?m). The Talmadge Memorial Bridge is 1,100 feet (340?m).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the total length of the three bridges, the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is 13,200 feet (4.0?km). The Sidney Lanier Bridge is 7,779 feet (2,371?m). The Talmadge Memorial Bridge is 10,032 feet (3.058?km), or 1.9 miles (3.1?km).\\r\\n\\r\\n The bridge is home to the annual USA Track & Field 10,000 meter (6.2?mi) Cooper River Bridge Run on the first weekend of April. This event attracts up to 50,000 people.

Desiring an additional source of income, David spends his life savings on high-quality Egyptian cotton sheets, planning to sell them to Miami retirement homes, but this venture fails to produce results. At a funeral for a friend, David runs into his high school best friend Efraim Diveroli, who had moved to Los Angeles some years prior to work with his uncle selling guns. Efraim has left his uncle and formed his own company, AEY, which fills orders for arms placed by the US government due to the ongoing War in Iraq. David's life takes another turn when his girlfriend informs him that she is pregnant. Efraim offers him a job at AEY, and even though David and Iz both vehemently oppose the war, David eventually agrees, telling his girlfriend that he has begun selling his cotton sheets to the US government through Efraim's contacts.\\r\\nEfraim explains to David that all orders placed for military equipment are posted on a public website, where anyone can place bids on filling the orders, and their job is to find the small orders that larger contractors do not bother with and place bids on them, with these smaller orders still being worth millions of dollars. A local small business owner, Ralph Slutzky, assists the business with funding, under the false belief that AEY only sells arms to help protect Israel. Eventually, David and Efraim land a contract to provide several thousand Beretta pistols to the Iraqi Police in Baghdad, a deal that would put them on the map. Unfortunately, an Italian embargo blocks the shipment to Iraq, so Efraim attempts to route the shipment through Jordan, but the shipment gets held up there as well. With Iz discovering David's true business by overhearing a conversation between him and Efraim, leaving her upset, David and Efraim have to fly to Jordan to free up their cargo or risk being blacklisted by the US Government for failing to deliver.\\r\\nIn Jordan, Efraim manages to use bribes to free up the Beretta shipment, but are still not allowed to fly the cargo to Baghdad without a permit that will take several weeks to acquire. The guns are loaded up into a truck and the two are provided with a driver who offers to drive the guns to Iraq, as no permit is required for driving guns across the border. The three drive through the night, at one point bribing border patrol with two cartons of cigarettes, and at another point being attacked by insurgents while trying to get gas, but eventually arrive at the military base. Captain Santos, the man receiving the shipment, is impressed by the lengths the two went through to get the guns to him, and the two are paid.\\r\\nAfter this, AEY continues to secure larger deals and make more money, even moving into a larger office and hiring more employees, and David's daughter Ella is born. Efraim, however, continues to grow more unstable and untrustworthy, as the company is suddenly given a chance to land their biggest deal yet. Known as \\"The Afghan Deal\\", the US Government wishes to arm the Afghan military for the long-term, and post a massive order worth $300 million, which includes 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition and would have netted the war dogs a $100 million profit. Filling this order proves to be near-impossible for such a relatively small company, particularly in that there is a global shortage on AK-47 ammunition, but the two end up lucking into an encounter with legendary US arms dealer Henry Girard. Girard has access to the massive weapon storages that were created in Albania but never used, and must now be disposed of in accordance with NATO treaties, which includes well over a hundred million rounds of AK-47 ammunition. Girard can not directly deal with the US Government anymore, due to being on a watchlist, and wants to make the deal through AEY. Efraim agrees, although David expresses discomfort working with a man who is on a terrorist watchlist.\\r\\nThe two go to Albania to confirm that the ammunition works, then place the winning bid on the contract ÿ though Efraim is upset to learn that their bid was the lowest by $53 million, reducing their profit margin. Meanwhile, Iz grows frustrated with David's continuing string of lies about his work, and leaves to live with her mother. While in Albania to prepare the shipment, David discovers that virtually all of the rounds are Chinese-made and illegal under a US embargo against Chinese arms. Efraim comes up with the idea of re-packaging the rounds in generic packaging, pretending that they are concerned about the weight of the shipments (though it inadvertently does save $3 million in shipping costs). While the rounds are repackaged and shipped, Efraim learns that Henry charged them a 400% markup (10 cents on 2.5 cents) on the rounds, and wants to cut him out of the deal. David protests that they are all making great money, but Efraim destroys the only copy of his partnership contract with David and proceeds with his plan to cut Henry out.\\r\\nHenry retaliates by having David kidnapped from his hotel room, beaten, and held at gunpoint before leaving him alive, though David is left wondering if his now missing Albanian driver, Bashkim, has been killed. David learns that Efraim has not paid the small ($100,000) cost to Enver, the Albanian who is handling the repackaging.\\r\\nDavid returns to Miami, where he tells Efraim that he is quitting AEY and demands immediate payout of the $4 million (offers to settle for $1.6) owed for his work-to-date, but Efraim refuses and laughs about the partnership contract being gone. David returns to working as a massage therapist and convinces Iz to move back in with him by telling her the truth about his AEY work. Weeks later, Efraim and Ralph Slutzky meet with David. Efraim offers a severance package of just $200,000, which David responds to by threatening to blackmail him with the evidence he has of the falsified documentation the two created to look like a respectable company so they could secure the Afghan deal. Shortly after this, David and Efraim are both arrested by the FBI. Enver, not paid for the repackaging contract and understanding the Chinese embargo, had reported AEY to the Pentagon. The FBI had arrested Ralph, who then wore a wire during the meeting with David and Efraim, giving the FBI enough to arrest them. Efraim is sentenced to four years in prison for numerous crimes related to conspiracy and fraud on the Afghan deal, and David gets seven months house arrest in exchange for co-operating with the investigation.\\r\\nMonths later, David meets with Henry, who apologizes for the kidnapping and assault in Albania, claiming he had bad information. He also thanks David for not mentioning his name in his confession to the FBI. David begins to ask questions about the events of the deal, including the fate of Bashkim. In response, Henry pulls out a briefcase full of money, a part of his own cut from the Afghan deal, and offers it to David in exchange for dropping the subject. The movie ends before David decides.\\r\\nInitially, Jesse Eisenberg and Shia LaBeouf were set to star in the film;[19] however, Jonah Hill and Miles Teller were eventually cast.[14][15] Further casting was announced in early 2015, with Ana de Armas joining in February,[16] and J.

It went on to gross $14.3 million in its opening weekend, finishing third at the box office and first among new releases.[30]\\r\\nWar Dogs received mixed reviews from critics.[31] On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 59% based on 195 reviews with an average rating of the 6.1/10.

A mechanical watch which is neither self-winding nor electrically driven is called a manual watch. Most mechanical watches manufactured today are self-winding.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a mechanical watch the watch's gears are turned by a spiral spring called a mainspring. In a manual watch energy is stored in the mainspring by turning a knob, the crown on the side of the watch, winding the mainspring. Then the energy from the mainspring powers the watch movement until it runs down, requiring the spring to be wound again.\\r\\nA self-winding watch movement has a mechanism which winds the mainspring using the natural motions of the wearer's body.[1] The watch contains an eccentric weight that turns on a pivot. The normal movements of the watch in the user's pocket or on the user's arm cause the rotor to pivot on its staff, which is attached to a ratcheted winding mechanism. The motion of the watch is thereby translated into circular motion of the weight which, through a series of reverser and reducing gears, eventually winds the mainspring. There are many different designs for modern self-winding mechanisms. Some designs allow winding of the watch to take place while the weight swings in only one direction while other, more advanced, mechanisms have two ratchets and wind the mainspring during both clockwise and anti-clockwise weight motions.\\r\\nThe fully wound mainspring in a typical watch can store enough energy reserve for roughly two days, allowing the watch to keep running through the night while stationary. In many cases automatic wristwatches can also be wound manually by turning the crown, so the watch can be kept running when not worn, and in case the wearer's wrist motions are not sufficient to keep it wound automatically.[2]\\r\\nSelf-winding mechanisms continue working even after the mainspring is fully wound up. If a simple mainspring was used, this would put excessive tension on the mainspring. This could break the mainspring, and even if it did not, it can cause a problem called \\"knocking\\" or \\"banking\\". The excessive drive force applied to the watch movement gear train can make the balance wheel rotate with excessive amplitude, causing the impulse pin to hit the back of the pallet fork horns. This will make the watch run fast, and could break the impulse pin. To prevent this, a slipping clutch device is used on the mainspring so it cannot be overwound.\\r\\nThe \\"slipping mainspring\\" device was patented by Adrien Philippe, one of the founders of Patek Philippe, on 16 June 1863,[3] long before self-winding wristwatches. In an ordinary watch mainspring barrel, the outer end of the spiral mainspring is attached to the inside of the barrel. In the slipping barrel, the mainspring is attached to a circular steel expansion spring, often called the 'bridle', which presses against the inside wall of the barrel, which has serrations or notches to hold it.[4]\\r\\nAs long as the mainspring is less than fully wound, the bridle holds the mainspring by friction to the barrel wall, allowing the mainspring to be wound. When the mainspring reaches full wind, its force is stronger than the bridle spring, and further winding pulls the bridle loose from the notches and it simply slides along the wall, preventing the mainspring from being wound further. The bridle must grip the barrel wall with just the right force to allow the mainspring to wind fully but not overwind. If it grips too loosely, the bridle will begin to slip before the mainspring is fully wound, a defect known as 'mainspring creep' which results in a shortened reserve power time.\\r\\nA further advantage of this device is that the mainspring cannot be broken by excessive manual winding. This feature is often described in watch company advertising as an \\"unbreakable mainspring\\".\\r\\nThe earliest reference to self-winding watches is at the end of 1773 when a newspaper reported that Joseph Tlustos had invented a watch that did not need to be wound.[5] But his idea was probably based on the myth of perpetual motion, and it is unlikely that it was a practical solution to the problem of self-winding watches. In 1776 Joseph Gallmayr also stated that he had made a self-winding watch, but there is no evidence to support this claim.\\r\\nThe earliest credible evidence for a successful design is the watch made by the Swiss watchmaker Abraham-Louis Perrelet, who lived in Le Locle. In late 1776 or early 1777, he invented a self-winding mechanism for pocket watches using an oscillating weight inside the watch that moved up and down.[6] The Geneva Society of Arts, reporting on this watch in 1777, stated that 15 minutes walking was necessary to fully wind the watch.\\r\\nIn 1777 Abraham-Louis Breguet also became interested in the idea and his first attempts led him to make a self-winding mechanism with a barrel remontoir.[7] Although a successful design, it was too complex and expensive for it to be manufactured and sold.\\r\\nAbout the end of 1777 or early 1778, Hubert Sarton (fr: Hubert Sarton) designed a watch with a rotor mechanism. Towards the end of 1778 he sent a watch to the French Academy of Sciences and a report was written which, together with a drawing, gave a detailed description of the mechanism.[8] Sarton's design is similar to those used in modern wrist watches, although there is no evidence linking the 18th-century design to 20th-century developments.\\r\\nAbout the beginning of 1779, Abraham-Louis Breguet became aware of Perrelet's watches, probably through Louis Recordon, who travelled from Geneva to London via Le Locle and Paris.[9] Breguet studied and improved the design, and made many self-winding watches from then to about 1810.\\r\\nAlthough a few self-winding watches and patents for them were made from 1780 on, for more than one hundred years these watches were rare, until the advent of the wrist watch.\\r\\nDuring the years 1776 to 1810 four different types of weight were used:\\r\\nAs noted above, some watches bidirectional winding and others used unidirectional winding. The latter is sufficient and all of Breguet's watches used unidirectional winding.\\r\\nBefore the invention of the slipping mainspring, automatic watches had a system for locking the weight. Most common, as in the 1780 drawing, when the mainspring was fully wound a lever K was raised that entered a hole N in the weight to prevent it from moving until the mainspring had unwound enough to lower the lever. Different methods were used in side-weight, rotor and center-weight mechanisms.\\r\\nThe advent of the wrist watch after World War I led to renewed interest in self-winding mechanisms, and all four types listed above were used:\\r\\nInvented by John Harwood, a watch repairer from Bolton, England, who took out a UK patent with his financial backer, Harry Cutts, on 7 July 1923, and obtained a corresponding Swiss patent on 16 October 1923.[14][15][16] The Harwood system used a pivoting weight which swung as the wearer moved, winding the mainspring. The ratchet mechanism wound the mainspring only when moving in one direction. The weight did not rotate a full 360; spring bumpers limited its swing to about 180, to encourage a back and forth motion.[17] This early type of self-winding mechanism is now referred to as a 'hammer' or 'bumper'.[18]\\r\\nLike its 18th century counterparts, Harwood's watch also had a problem with jerking because \\"the brass weight hit too sharply against the banking pins as it pivoted\\".[19]\\r\\nWhen fully wound, Harwood's watch would run for 12 hours autonomously.[citation needed] It did not have a conventional stem winder, so the hands were moved manually by rotating a bezel around the face of the watch. The watches were first produced with the help of Swiss watch manufacturer Fortis and went on sale in 1928. 30,000 were made before the Harwood Self-Winding Watch Company collapsed in 1931 in the Great Depression. 'Bumper' watches were the first commercially successful automatic watches; they were made by several high grade watch manufacturers during the 1930s and 1940s.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Rolex Watch Company improved Harwood's design in 1930 and used it as the basis for the Rolex Oyster Perpetual, in which the centrally mounted semi-circular weight could rotate through a full 360 rather than the about 200 of the 'bumper' winder. Rolex's version also increased the amount of energy stored in the mainspring, allowing it to run autonomously for up to 35 hours.\\r\\nInformation about 18th century rotor watches was not published until 1949. Although the Oyster Perpetual was probably an original invention, the company may have known of Coviot's 1893 patent that re-invented the 18th century design.[20]\\r\\nThe next development for automatic watches came in 1948 from Eterna Watch. To wind a watch effectively, one of the chief requirements of a rotor is heft. Until this point, the best bearing used in any watch was a jewel bearing, which perfectly suits the small gears of a watch. A rotor, on the other hand, requires a different solution. In 1948, Eterna introduced the solution that is still in use today: ball bearings. Ball bearings provide robust support for a heavy object to rotate smoothly and reliably even under abnormal stress, such as if the watch were dropped.\\r\\nBy the 1960s, automatic winding had become standard in quality mechanical watches. Because the rotor weight needed in an automatic watch takes up a lot of space in the case, increasing its thickness, some manufacturers of quality watches, such as Patek Philippe, continue to design manually wound watches, which can be as thin as 1.77 millimeters.\\r\\nHowever, in 2007 Carl F. Bucherer implemented a new approach without a rotor, a peripherally mounted power source, where a geared ring made of tungsten encircles the entire mechanism, rotating on carbon rollers whenever the watch moves. A system of clutch wheels captures power. No rotor means thinner watches and an ultradense weight swinging around a greater radius means a better chance of achieving a greater power reserve with same amount of arm movement.[21][22]","input":"How long does a self-winding watch stay wound?"},{"output":"because of the large inflows of immigrants after 1845 from cultures that were different from the existing American culture","context":"Nativism is the political policy of promoting the interests of native inhabitants against those of immigrants.[1] However, as of  2018[update] it is more commonly described[by whom?] as an  immigration-restriction position.[2][need quotation to verify]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn scholarly studies nativism is a standard technical term. Those who hold this political view, however, do not typically accept the label. Dindar (2009) wrote, \\"nativists... do not consider themselves as nativists. For them it is a negative term and they rather consider themselves as 'Patriots'\\".[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Fetzer (2000), opposition to immigration commonly arises in many countries because of issues of national, cultural, and religious identity. The phenomenon has been studied especially in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as in continental Europe. Thus nativism has become a general term for \\"opposition to immigration\\" based on fears that the immigrants will distort or spoil existing cultural values.[4] In situations where immigrants greatly outnumber the original inhabitants,[5] nativistic movements can allow cultural survival. The claim that immigrants can \\"swamp\\" a local population is related to birth rate relative to nationals. Contemporary opponents of immigration blame it for such problems as unemployment, crime (especially through gangs), harm to the environment, housing shortage, and overwhelming social services such as hospitals, police.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmigration restrictionist sentiment is typically justified with one or more of the following arguments and claims about immigrants:[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Australians opposed the influx of Chinese immigrants at time of the nineteenth-century gold rushes. When the separate Australian colonies formed the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, the new nation adopted \\"White Australia\\" as one of its founding principles. Under the White Australia policy, entry of Chinese and other Asians remained controversial until well after World War II, although the country remained home to many long-established Chinese families dating from before the adoption of White Australia. By contrast, most Pacific Islanders were deported soon after the policy was adopted, while the remainder were forced out of the canefields where they had worked for decades.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nHostility of native-born white Australians toward British and Irish immigrants in the late 19th century was manifested in a new party, the Australian Natives' Association.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince early 2000, opposition has mounted to asylum seekers arriving in boats from Indonesia.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Brazilian elite desired the racial whitening of the country, similarly to Argentina and Uruguay. The country encouraged European immigration, but non-white immigration always faced considerable backlash. On July 28, 1921, representatives Andrade Bezerra and Cincinato Braga proposed a law whose Article 1 provided: \\"The immigration of individuals from the black race to Brazil is prohibited.\\" On October 22, 1923, representative Fidlis Reis produced another bill on the entry of immigrants, whose fifth article was as follows: \\"The entry of settlers from the black race into Brazil is prohibited. For Asian [immigrants] there will be allowed each year a number equal to 5% of those residing in the country.(...)\\".[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, there were negative feelings toward the communities of German, Italian, Japanese, and Jewish immigrants, who conserved their language and culture instead of adopting Portuguese and Brazilian habit (so that nowadays Brazil has the biggest communities in the Americas of speakers of German and Venetian), were seen as particularly tendentious to form ghettos, had high rates of endogamy (in Brazil, it is regarded as usual for people of different backgrounds to miscegenate), among other concerns.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt affected more harshly the Japanese, because they were Asian, and thus seen as an obstacle of the whitening of Brazil. Oliveira Viana, a Brazilian jurist, historian and sociologist described the Japanese immigrants as follows: \\"They (Japanese) are like sulfur: insoluble\\". The Brazilian magazine \\"O Malho\\" in its edition of December 5, 1908 issued a charge of Japanese immigrants with the following legend: \\"The government of S?o Paulo is stubborn. After the failure of the first Japanese immigration, it contracted 3,000 yellow people. It insists on giving Brazil a race diametrically opposite to ours\\".[13] In 1941, the Brazilian Minister of Justice, Francisco Campos, defended the ban on admission of 400 Japanese immigrants in S?o Paulo and wrote: \\"their despicable standard of living is a brutal competition with the country's worker; their selfishness, their bad faith, their refractory character, make them a huge ethnic and cultural cyst located in the richest regions of Brazil\\".[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome years before World War II, the government of President Get~lio Vargas initiated a process of forced assimilation of people of immigrant origin in Brazil. The Constitution of 1934 had a legal provision about the subject: \\"The concentration of immigrants anywhere in the country is prohibited; the law should govern the selection, location and assimilation of the alien\\". The assimilationist project affected mainly German, Italian, Japanese and Jewish immigrants and their descendants.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II they were seen as more loyal to their countries of origin than to Brazil. In fact, there were violent revolts in the Japanese community of the states of S?o Paulo and Paran when Emperor Hirohito declared that Japan surrendered and he was not a deity, which was thought as a conspiracy trying to hurt Japanese honor and strength. Nevertheless, it followed hostility from the government. The Japanese Brazilian community was strongly marked by restrictive measures when Brazil declared war against Japan in August 1942. Japanese Brazilians could not travel the country without safe conduct issued by the police; over 200 Japanese schools were closed and radio equipment was seized to prevent transmissions on short wave from Japan. The goods of Japanese companies were confiscated and several companies of Japanese origin had interventions, including the newly founded Banco Amrica do Sul. Japanese Brazilians were prohibited from driving motor vehicles (even if they were taxi drivers), buses or trucks on their property. The drivers employed by Japanese had to have permission from the police. Thousands of Japanese immigrants were arrested or expelled from Brazil on suspicion of espionage. There were many anonymous denunciations because of \\"activities against national security\\" arising from disagreements between neighbours, recovery of debts and even fights between children.[13] Japanese Brazilians were arrested for \\"suspicious activity\\" when they were in artistic meetings or picnics. On July 10, 1943, approximately 10,000 Japanese and German immigrants who lived in Santos had 24 hours to close their homes and businesses and move away from the Brazilian coast. The police acted without any notice. About 90% of people displaced were Japanese. To reside in Baixada Santista, the Japanese had to have a safe conduct.[13] In 1942, the Japanese community who introduced the cultivation of pepper in Tom-A?u, in Par, was virtually turned into a \\"concentration camp\\" (expression of the time) from which no Japanese could leave. This time, the Brazilian ambassador in Washington, D.C., Carlos Martins Pereira e Sousa, encouraged the government of Brazil to transfer all the Japanese Brazilians to \\"internment camps\\" without the need for legal support, in the same manner as was done with the Japanese residents in the United States. No single suspicion of activities of Japanese against \\"national security\\" was confirmed.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nNowadays, nativism in Brazil affects primarily migrants from elsewhere in the Third World, such as the new wave of Levantine Arabs (this time, mostly Muslim from Palestine instead of overwhelmingly Christian from Syria and Lebanon), South and East Asians (primarily Mainland Chinese), Spanish-speakers and Amerindians from neighboring South American countries and, especially, West Africans and Haitians. Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake and considerable illegal immigration to northern Brazil and S?o Paulo,[15] a subsequent debate in the population was concerned with the reasons why Brazil has such lax laws and enforcement concerning illegal immigration.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the 1988's Brazilian Constitution, it is an unbailable crime to address someone in an offensive racist way, and it is illegal to discriminate someone on the basis of his or her race, skin color, national or regional origin or nationality (for more, see anti-discrimination laws in Brazil), thus nativism and opposition to multiculturalism would be too much of a polemic and delicate topic to be openly discussed as a basic ideology of even the most right-leaning modern political parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nNativism was common in Canada (though the term originated in the U.S.). It took several forms. Hostility to the Chinese and other Asians was intense, and involved provincial laws that hindered immigration of Chinese and Japanese and blocked their economic mobility. In 1942 Japanese Canadians were forced into detention camps in response to Japanese aggression in World War II.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the 19th century, well into the 20th, the Orange Order in Canada attacked and tried to politically defeat the Irish Catholics.[17] The Ku Klux Klan spread in the mid-1920s from the U.S. to parts of Canada, especially Saskatchewan, where it helped topple the Liberal government. The Klan creed was, historian Martin Robin argues, in the mainstream of Protestant Canadian sentiment, for it was based on \\"Protestantism, separation of Church and State, pure patriotism, restrictive and selective immigration, one national public school, one flag and one languageEnglish.\\"[18][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn World War I, Canadian naturalized citizens of German or Austrian origins were stripped of their right to vote, and tens of thousands of Ukrainians (who were born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire) were rounded up and put in internment camps.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nHostility of native-born Canadians to competition from English immigrants in the early 20th century was expressed in signs that read, \\"No English Need Apply!\\" The resentment came because the immigrants identified more with England than with Canada.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the British Empire, traditions of anti-Catholicism in Britain led to fears that Catholics were a threat to the national (British) values. In Canada, the Orange Order (of Irish Protestants) campaigned vigorously against the Catholics throughout the 19th century, often with violent confrontations. Both sides were immigrants from Ireland and neither side claimed loyalty to Canada.[21] The Orange Order was much less influential in the U.S., especially after a major riot in New York City in 1871.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nNativism in Hong Kong is often used as a synonymy with localism,[23] which strives for the autonomy of Hong Kong and resist China's authorities influence in the city. In addition to their strong anti-communist and pro-democracy tendency, It often holds a strong anti-mainland sentiments, especially the influx of the mainland tourists and immigrants, seeing them as a threat to Hong Kong identity and culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Poles in the mining districts of western Germany before 1914, it was nationalism (on both the German and the Polish sides), which kept Polish workers, who had established an associational structure approaching institutional completeness (churches, voluntary associations, press, even unions), separate from the host German society. Lucassen found that religiosity and nationalism were more fundamental in generating nativism and inter-group hostility than the labor antagonism.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce Italian workers in France had understood the benefit of unionism and French unions were willing to overcome their fear of Italians as strikebreakers, integration was open for most Italian immigrants. The French state, which was always more of an immigration state than Prussia, Germany or Great Britain, fostered and supported family-based immigration and thus helped Italians on their immigration trajectory with minimal nativism.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany observers see the post-1950s wave of immigration in Europe was fundamentally different from the pre-1914 patterns. They debate the role of cultural differences, ghettos, race, Muslim fundamentalism, poor education and poverty play in creating nativism among the hosts and a caste-type underclass, more similar to white-black tensions in the US.[24] Algerian migration to France has generated nativism, characterized by the prominence of Jean-Marie Le Pen and his National Front.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pakistani province of Sindh has seen nativist movements, promoting control for the Sindhi people over their homeland. After the 1947 Partition of India, large numbers of Muhajir people migrating from India entered the province, becoming a majority in the provincial capital city of Karachi, which formerly had an ethnically Sindhi majority. Sindhis have also voiced opposition to the promotion of Urdu, as opposed to their native tongue, Sindhi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese nativist movements are expressed through Sindhi nationalism and the Sindhudesh separatist movement. Nativist and nationalist sentiments increased greatly after the independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971.\\r\\n\\r\\nNativism flourished in Taiwan in the 1970s as a reaction against the influx of mainland Chinese to the island after the Kuomintang's defeat in 1949. Nativists felt that the political influence of mainland Chinese was disproportionately large. The term is especially found in the field of literature, where nativist literature was more traditionally minded than the modernist literature written largely by mainland Chinese.\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon was notorious for its xenophobia in the 16th century, and conditions worsened in the 1580s. Many immigrants became disillusioned by routine threats of violence and molestation, attempts at expulsion of foreigners, and the great difficulty in acquiring English citizenship. Dutch cities proved more hospitable, and many left London permanently.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding the Irish in 20th-century Great Britain, Lucassen[24] argues that the deep religious divide between the Protestants and Catholics was at the core of the ongoing estrangement of the Irish in British society.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNativism was a political factor in the 1790s and in the 1830s-1850s. There was little nativism in the colonial era, but for a while Benjamin Franklin was hostile to German Americans in colonial Pennsylvania; He called them \\"Palatine Boors.\\" However, he reversed himself and became a supporter.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nNativism became a major issue in the late 1790s, when the Federalist Party expressed its strong opposition to the French Revolution by trying to strictly limit immigration, and stretching the time to 14 years for citizenship. At the time of the Quasi-War with France in 1798, the Federalists and Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, including the Alien Act, the Naturalization Act and the Sedition Act. The movement was led by Alexander Hamilton, despite his own status as an immigrant from a small Island. Phillip Magness argues that Hamiltons political career might legitimately be characterized as a sustained drift into nationalistic xenophobia.[27] Thomas Jefferson and James Madison fought by drafting the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions. The two laws against aliens were motivated by fears of a growing Irish radical presence in Philadelphia, where they supported Jefferson.[28] However, they were not actually enforced.[29] President John Adams annoyed his fellow Federalists by making peace with France, and splitting his party in 1800. Jefferson was elected president, and reversed most of the hostile legislation.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"nativism\\" was first used by 1844: \\"Thousands were Naturalized expressly to oppose Nativism, and voted the Polk ticket mainly to that end.\\"[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nNativism gained its name from the \\"Native American\\" parties of the 1840s and 1850s. In this context \\"Native\\" does not mean indigenous Americans or American Indians but rather those descended from the inhabitants of the original Thirteen Colonies. It impacted politics in the mid-19th century because of the large inflows of immigrants after 1845 from cultures that were different from the existing American culture. Nativists objected primarily to Irish Roman Catholics because of their loyalty to the Pope and also because of their supposed rejection of republicanism as an American ideal.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nNativist movements included the Know Nothing or American Party of the 1850s, the Immigration Restriction League of the 1890s, the anti-Asian movements in the West, resulting in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the \\"Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907\\" by which Japan's government stopped emigration to the United States. Labor unions were strong supporters of Chinese exclusion and limits on immigration, because of fears that they would lower wages and make it harder for workers to organize unions.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorian Eric Kaufmann has suggested that American nativism has been explained primarily in psychological and economic terms due to the neglect of a crucial cultural and ethnic dimension. Furthermore, Kauffman claims that American nativism cannot be understood without reference to an American ethnic group which took shape prior to the large-scale immigration of the mid-eighteenth century.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nNativist outbursts occurred in the Northeast from the 1830s to the 1850s, primarily in response to a surge of Irish Catholic immigration. In 1836, Samuel Morse ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of New York City on a Nativist ticket, receiving 1,496 votes. In New York City, an Order of United Americans was founded as a nativist fraternity, following the Philadelphia Nativist Riots of the preceding spring and summer, in December, 1844.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nativists went public in 1854 when they formed the 'American Party', which was especially hostile to the immigration of Irish Catholics and campaigned for laws to require longer wait time between immigration and naturalization. (The laws never passed.) It was at this time that the term \\"nativist\\" first appears, opponents denounced them as \\"bigoted nativists.\\" Former President Millard Fillmore ran on the American Party ticket for the Presidency in 1856. The American Party also included many ex-Whigs who ignored nativism, and included (in the South) a few Catholics whose families had long lived in America. Conversely, much of the opposition to Catholics came from Protestant Irish immigrants and German Lutheran immigrants who were not native at all and can hardly be called \\"nativists.\\"[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis form of nationalism is often identified with xenophobia and anti-Catholic sentiment (anti-Papism). In Charlestown, Massachusetts, a nativist mob attacked and burned down a Catholic convent in 1834 (no one was injured). In the 1840s, small scale riots between Catholics and nativists took place in several American cities. In Philadelphia in 1844, for example, a series of nativist assaults on Catholic churches and community centers resulted in the loss of lives and the professionalization of the police force. In Louisville, Kentucky, election-day rioters killed at least 22 people in attacks on German and Irish Catholics on Aug. 6, 1855, in what became known as \\"Bloody Monday.\\"[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new Republican Party kept its nativist element quiet during the 1860s, since immigrants were urgently needed for the Union Army. Immigrants from England, Scotland and Scandinavia favored the Republicans during the Third Party System, 1854-1896, while others were usually Democratic. Hostility toward Asians was very strong from the 1860s to the 1940s. Nativism experienced a revival in the 1890s, led by Protestant Irish immigrants hostile to Catholic immigration, especially the American Protective Association.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 1840s to 1920 German Americans were distrusted because of their separatist social structure, their German-language schools, their attachment to their native tongue over English, and their neutrality during World War I.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bennett Law caused a political uproar in Wisconsin in 1890, as the state government passed a law that threatened to close down hundreds of German-language elementary schools. Catholic and Lutheran Germans rallied to defeat Governor William D. Hoard. Hoard attacked German American culture and religion:\\r\\n\\r\\nHoard, a Republican, was defeated by the Democrats. A similar campaign in Illinois regarding the \\"Edwards Law\\" led to a Republican defeat there in 1890.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1917ÿ1918, a wave of nativist sentiment led to the suppression of German cultural activities in the United States, Canada and Australia. There was little violence, but many places and streets had their names changed (The city of \\"Berlin\\" in Ontario was renamed \\"Kitchener\\" after a British hero), churches switched to English for their services, and German Americans were forced to buy war bonds to show their patriotism.[40] In Australia thousands of Germans were put into internment camps.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\n(See also: World War I Anti-German Sentiment)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1870s in the western states Irish Americans targeted violence against Chinese workers, driving them out of smaller towns. Denis Kearney, an immigrant from Ireland, led a mass movement in San Francisco in the 1870s that incited attacks on the Chinese there and threatened public officials and railroad owners.[42] The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first of many nativist acts of Congress which attempted to limit the flow of immigrants into the U.S.. The Chinese responded to it by filing false claims of American birth, enabling thousands of them to immigrate to California.[43] The exclusion of the Chinese caused the western railroads to begin importing Mexican railroad workers in greater numbers (\\"traqueros\\").[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1890sÿ1920s era nativists and labor unions campaigned for immigration restriction. A favorite plan was the literacy test to exclude workers who could not read or write their own foreign language. Congress passed literacy tests, but presidentsresponding to business needs for workersvetoed them.[45] Senator Henry Cabot Lodge argued need for literacy tests and its implication on the new immigrants:\\r\\n\\r\\nResponding to these demands, opponents of the literacy test called for the establishment of an immigration commission to focus on immigration as a whole. The United States Immigration Commission, also known as the Dillingham Commission, was created and tasked with studying immigration and its effect on the United States. The findings of the commission further influenced immigration policy and upheld the concerns of the nativist movement.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing World War I, nativists in the twenties focused their attention on Catholics, Jews, and south-eastern Europeans and realigned their beliefs behind racial and religious nativism.[47] The racial concern of the anti-immigration movement was linked closely to the eugenics movement that was sweeping the United States in the twenties. Led by Madison Grant's book, The Passing of the Great Race nativists grew more concerned with the racial purity of the United States. In his book, Grant argued that the American racial stock was being diluted by the influx of new immigrants from the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and the ghettos. The Passing of the Great Race reached wide popularity among Americans and influenced immigration policy in the twenties.[45]\\r\\nIn the 1920s a wide national consensus sharply restricted the overall inflow of immigrants, especially those from southern and eastern Europe. The second Ku Klux Klan, which flourished in the U.S. in the 1920s, used strong nativist rhetoric, but the Catholics led a counterattack.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter intense lobbying from the nativist movement the United States Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act in 1921. This bill was the first to place numerical quotas on immigration. It capped the inflow of immigrations to 357,803 for those arriving outside of the western hemisphere.[45] However, this bill was only temporary as Congress began debating a more permanent bill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emergency Quota Act was followed with the Immigration Act of 1924, a more permanent resolution. This law reduced the number of immigrants able to arrive from 357,803, the number established in the Emergency Quota Act, to 164,687.[45] Though this bill did not fully restrict immigration, it considerably curbed the flow of immigration into the United States, especially from Southern and Eastern Europe. During the late twenties an average of 270,000 immigrants were allowed to arrive mainly because of the exemption of Canada and Latin American countries.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nFear of low-skilled immigrants flooding the labor market was an issue in the 1920s (focused on immigrants from Italy and Poland), and in the first decade of the 21st century (focused on immigrants from Mexico and Central America).\\r\\n\\r\\nAn immigration reductionism movement formed in the 1970s and continues to the present day. Prominent members often press for massive, sometimes total, reductions in immigration levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican nativist sentiment experienced a resurgence in the late 20th century, this time directed at undocumented workers, largely Mexican resulting in the passage of new penalties against illegal immigration in 1996.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost immigration reductionists see Illegal immigration, principally from across the United StatesÿMexico border, as the more pressing concern. Authors such as Samuel Huntington have also seen recent Hispanic immigration as creating a national identity crisis and presenting insurmountable problems for US social institutions.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nNoting the large-scale Mexican immigration in the Southwest, the Cold-war diplomat George F. Kennan in 2002 saw \\"unmistakable evidences of a growing differentiation between the cultures, respectively, of large southern and southwestern regions of this country, on the one hand\\", and those of \\"some northern regions\\". In the former, he warned:\\r\\n\\r\\nMayers argues that Kennan represented the \\"tradition of militant nativism\\" that resembled or even exceeded the Know Nothings of the 1850s.[51] Mayers adds that Kennan also believed American women had too much power.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy late 2014, the \\"Tea Party movement\\" had turned its focus away from economic issues, spending, and Obamacare, and towards President Barack Obama's immigration policies, which it saw as threatening to transform American society. It planned to defeat leading Republicans who supported immigration programs, such as Senator John McCain.  A typical slogan appeared in the Tea Party Tribune: Amnesty for Millions, Tyranny for All. The New York Times reported:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his 2016 bid for presidency, Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump has been accused of introducing nativist themes for his controversial stances on temporarily banning foreign Muslims from entering the United States and erecting a substantial wall between the US-Mexico border to halt illegal immigration. Journalist John Cassidy wrote in The New Yorker Trump is transforming the GOP into a populist, nativist party:\\r\\n\\r\\nDonald Brand, a professor of political science, argues:\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican nativists have promoted English and deprecated the use of German and Spanish. English Only proponents in the late 20th century proposed an English Language Amendment (ELA), a Constitutional Amendment making English the official language of the United States, but it received limited political support.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nthe policy of protecting the interests of native inhabitants against those of immigrants.","input":"Why did nativism increase during the early 19th century?"},{"output":"a yellow or gold Nordic Cross (i.e. an asymmetrical horizontal cross, with the crossbar closer to the hoist than the fly, with the cross extending to the edge of the flag) on a field of blue","context":"The flag of Sweden consists of a yellow or gold Nordic Cross (i.e. an asymmetrical horizontal cross, with the crossbar closer to the hoist than the fly, with the cross extending to the edge of the flag) on a field of blue. The Nordic Cross design traditionally represents Christianity.[2][3] The design and colors of the Swedish flag are believed to have been inspired by the present coat of arms of Sweden of 1442, which is blue divided quarterly by a cross patte of gold, and modeled on the Danish flag.[4] Blue and yellow have been used as Swedish colours at least since King Magnus III's royal coat of arms of 1275.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dimensions of the Swedish flag are 5:2:9 horizontally and 4:2:4 vertically. The dimensions of the Swedish flag with a triple-tail are 5:2:5:8 horizontally and 4:2:4 vertically. The colors of the flag are officially established through the Natural Color System to be NCS 0580-Y10R for the shade of yellow, and NCS 4055-R95B for the shade of blue.[5] The square-cut Swedish state flag is identical to the civil ensign. The Swedish law does not regulate the design of the Swedish pennant, but it is recommended that its color scheme should correspond with that of the flag.[6]\\r\\nThe triple-tailed flag (tretungad flagga) is used as a military ensign (?rlogsflaggan). Its overall ratio, including the tails, is 1:2. The flag is also used as the Swedish naval jack (?rlogsg?sen). The jacks are smaller than the ensigns, but they have the same proportions. The Swedish swallowtail flag was originally the King's personal emblem, or the emblem representing a command conferred by the King. It was at first two-pointed, but by the mid-17th century, the distinctive swallowtail with tongue appeared. The flag is also flown by the defence ministry, while civil ministries fly square flags.\\r\\nThe Swedish royal flag (Kungliga flaggan) is still identical to the triple-tailed military flag, but usually includes in its center a white field with the greater or the lesser coat of arms with the Order of the Seraphim, which has the King of Sweden as its Grand Master. The King personally decides about the specific use of the royal flag.[7]\\r\\nAccording to early modern legend,[citation needed][year?needed] the 12th-century King Eric IX saw a golden cross in the sky as he landed in Finland during the First Swedish Crusade in 1157. Seeing this as a sign from God he adopted the golden cross against a blue background as his banner.\\r\\nIt has been suggested[according to whom?] that the Swedish origin legend is chosen to counter a parallel origin story for the Danish flag, also recorded in the 16th century. According to this theory,[citation needed] the Swedish flag was created during the reign of King Charles VIII, who also introduced the coat of arms of Sweden in 1442. The national coat of arms is a combination of King Albert's coat of arms of 1364 and King Magnus III's coat of arms of 1275, and is blue divided quarterly by a golden cross patte.\\r\\nOther historians[who?] claim that the Swedish flag was blue with a white cross before 1420, and became blue with a golden cross only during the early reign King Gustav I, who deposed King Christian II in 1521.\\r\\nThe exact age of the Swedish flag is not known, but the oldest recorded pictures of a blue cloth with a yellow cross date from the early 16th century, during the reign of King Gustav I.[citation needed] The first legal description of the flag was made in a royal warrant of 19 April 1562 as \\"yellow in a cross fashioned on blue\\".[8] As stipulated in a royal warrant of 1569, the yellow cross was always to be borne on Swedish battle standards and banners. Prior to this, a similar flag appeared in the coat of arms of King John III's duchy, which is today Southwest Finland. The same coat of arms is still used by the province.\\r\\nA royal warrant of 6 November 1663, regulated the use of the triple-tailed flag, to be used only as a state flag and military ensign.[1] According to the same royal warrant, merchant ships were only allowed to fly square-cut city flags in their respective provincial colours. In practice, however, the merchant fleet began using a square-cut civil ensign of the state flag. In a government instruction of ship building of 1730, this civil ensign should have the same proportions and colors as the state flag, with the notable difference of being square-cut.[9] In 1756, the use of pennants by private ships was prohibited.[10]\\r\\nA royal warrant of 18 August 1761, stipulated that an all blue triple-tailed flag to be used by the archipelago fleet, a branch of the army tasked with defending the archipelago along the Swedish coastlines. The commander of the fleet also had the right to order the use of the ordinary war ensign instead of the blue ensign when that was \\"appropriate\\".[11] The blue flag was used until 1813.\\r\\nOn 6 June 1815, a common military ensign was introduced for the two united kingdoms of Sweden and Norway. This flag was identical to the former triple-tailed military ensign of Sweden, with a white saltire on red to be included in the canton. Proposed by the Norwegian Prime Minister and unionist Peder Anker, the white saltire on a red background was supposed to symbolise Norway, as the country had previously been united with Denmark and initially continued to use the same flag as an independent country, but with the national arms in the canton.[12]\\r\\nNorwegian ships continued to use the Danish civil ensign distinguished with the national arms in the canton north of Cape Finisterre, but had to fly the Swedish civil ensign in the Mediterranean to be protected from pirate attacks. A common civil ensign for both countries was introduced in 1818, on the pattern of the naval ensign, but square-cut. This flag was optional for Swedish vessels, but compulsory for Norwegian ones in distant waters. In 1821, Norway adopted a new national civil ensign, identical to the present flag of Norway.\\r\\nFollowing the adoption of a separate Norwegian flag, a royal regulation of 17 July 1821, stipulated that ships of both kingdoms use the common square-cut civil ensign (with the saltire included) in \\"distant waters\\" (i.e. beyond Cape Finisterre).[13] In \\"distant waters\\", they had the right to use any of the square-cut civil ensigns of their respective countries, or the uniform Union civil ensign. This system was in force until 1838.\\r\\nA royal resolution of 20 June 1844, introduced new flags and heraldry to denote the equal status of the two kingdoms within the union. Both countries were granted civil and military ensigns on the same pattern, their respective national flags with the addition of a union mark in the canton, combining the flag colours of both countries. The naval ensign was based on the traditional triple-tailed Swedish model. In addition, the new union mark was to be used as the naval jack and as the flag for the common diplomatic representations abroad. The warrant also stipulated that the merchant fleet use their respective countries' square-cut civil ensigns, including the new union mark. Also, royal ensigns were introduced for both countries, their respective naval ensigns with the union mark, with the addition of the union arms at the center of the cross. The new union flags were well received by the Norwegians, who had demanded their own military ensign since the union was formed. In Sweden, however, the new union mark in particular became quite unpopular and was contemptuously nicknamed the Sillsallaten (Swedish) or Sildesalaten (Norwegian) after a colorful dish of pickled herring, decorated with red beets and apples in a radial pattern. It is believed that the name was first used in a speech by Lord Brakel in the Swedish House of Lords in Stockholm.[14]\\r\\nDuring the 19th century, a number of regulations were issued regarding the use of Swedish flags. The military ensign was also to be used by civil government ships and buildings, such as the Customs, Harbor pilots and the Royal Mail. For this use, the military ensign would have a white field included with a golden marker: For the Harbor pilots (as of 1881, based on a proposal of 1825) an anchor with a star;[15] for the Customs (as of 1844) the letter \\"T\\" topped a royal crown;[16] for the Royal Mail (as of 1844) a postal horn with a royal crown. On 7 May 1897, an alternate State flag was introduced. This double-tailed flag was used by government owned ships and buildings, which did not fly the triple-tailed military ensign.\\r\\nDuring the late 19th century, increasing Norwegian dissatisfaction with the union led to the demand for a return to the \\"pure\\" flag of 1821 without the union mark. Opponents of the union began to use this flag several years before it was officially recognised. During the 1890s, two consecutive sessions of the Norwegian parliament voted to abolish the mark, but the decision was overruled by royal veto. However, in 1898, when the flag law was passed for the third time, the king had to sanction it. On 12 October 1899, the union mark was removed from the Norwegian civil ensign. As the Norwegian military ensign according to the constitution of 1814 was to be a union ensign, the union mark remained on military flags until the dissolution of the union with Sweden. \\"Pure\\" military ensigns were hoisted on fortresses and naval vessels on 9 June 1905.\\r\\nThe union mark, however, remained a part of the Swedish flag until 1905, when a Law of 28 October 1905, stipulated the exclusion of the union mark as of 1 November 1905.[17]\\r\\nOn 1 November 1905, the triple-tailed flag also became the Swedish naval jack. The Flag law of 22 June 1906 further regulated the use and design of the flag, notably was a lighter blue colour than was used before. The Swedish state flag became identical to the square-cut civil ensign, and all private use of the triple-tailed flag was prohibited.\\r\\nWhen used from a standalone flagpole, the size of the flag is recommended to have a width equaling a fourth of the height of the pole. When used from a flagpole extending from a building, the flag is recommended to have a width equaling a third of the height (length) of the pole. It is further recommended to fly the flag only during daytime, and to lower it no later than 9 pm. Only when the country is at war is it recommended to fly the flag also at night.\\r\\nThe king and queen use a royal flag with the greater national coat of arms. Other members of the royal house use a royal flag with the lesser national coat of arms. On naval ships the flag of the king is raised together with a split pennat with the greater national coat of arms. Likewise the flag of the heir apparent is raised together with a split pennat with the lesser national coat of arms on naval ships.\\r\\nThe Swedish Marshal of the Realm (Riksmarskalken) has published a series of decisions regarding the royal flag of Sweden. In a decision of 6 April 1987, rules are defined on how to fly the royal flag at the Royal Palace of Stockholm.[18]\\r\\nUnder King Carl XVI Gustaf, king since 1973, the plain triple-tailed flag has flown at the Royal Palace only once. This occurred on 2-3 July 1988, when the King went on a private visit to Wuppertal, Germany; at the same time, the Duke of Halland, his uncle and the only person in the line of succession, was on a private visit to Sainte-Maxime, France. The Government therefore ordered the Speaker of the Riksdag, Ingemund Bengtsson, to serve as Regent ad interim for two days.\\r\\nThere have been a few notable exemptions regarding the prohibition of private parties to use the State flag. All these privileges were terminated in accordance with the new specific flag regulation of 22 June 1906.\\r\\nThe flag of Sweden appears in coat of arms of Finlands province Southwest Finland.\\r\\nThe flag of Wilmington, Delaware in the United States is modelled after the Swedish flag in remembrance of the short-lived colony of New Sweden, with the cross affixed with the seal of the city. The flag of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which also lies within historic New Sweden, is a vertical triband rather than a Nordic Cross, but the blue and yellow colours of the flag were chosen to commemorate the Swedish settlement of the region.[21] The flag of Verona (Italy) resembles the flag of Sweden in colours and features. The former flag has a symmetric yellow cross, although the similarities between the two flags may be historically unrelated. According to a legend, the Argentine football team, Boca Juniors' flag and colours were inspired by the flag of Sweden.[22]","input":"What does the flag of sweden look like?"},{"output":"June 29, 2007","context":"The history of iPhone began with a request from inventor Steve Jobs to Apple Inc.'s engineers, asking them to investigate the use of touchscreen devices and tablet computers (which later came to fruition with the iPad).[1][2][3][4] Many have noted the device's similarities to Apple's previous touch-screen portable device, the Newton MessagePad.[5][6][7][8] Like the Newton, the iPhone is nearly all screen. Its form factor is credited to Apple's Chief Design Officer, Jonathan Ive.[3][9]\\r\\nIn April 2003, at the \\"All Things Digital\\" executive conference, Jobs expressed his belief that tablet PCs and traditional PDAs were not good choices as high-demand markets for Apple to enter, despite receiving many requests for Apple to create another PDA. He believed that cell phones were going to become important devices for portable information access, and that mobile phones needed to have excellent synchronization software. At that time, instead of focusing on a follow-up to their Newton PDA, Jobs had Apple focus on the iPod. Jobs also had Apple develop the iTunes software, which can be used to synchronize content with iPod devices. iTunes was released in January 2001.[10][11][12][13] On September 7, 2005, Apple and Motorola released the ROKR E1, the first mobile phone to use iTunes. Jobs was unhappy with the ROKR, feeling that having to compromise with a non-Apple designer (Motorola) prevented Apple from designing the phone they wanted to make.[14] In September 2006, Apple discontinued support for the ROKR, and released a version of iTunes that included references to an as-yet unknown mobile phone that could display pictures and video.[15] Ed Zander (the CEO of Motorola at the time) \\"inspired\\"[clarify] Steve Jobs with Moto's[clarify] multimedia (e.g., iTunes) + smartphone product concept.[clarify] As a result, Apple gained a new product concept, called \\"iPhone\\", while Motorola walked away[clarify] with a limited version of iTunes for Rokr/Slvr.\\r\\nOn January 9, 2007, Steve Jobs announced iPhone at the Macworld convention, receiving substantial media attention.[16] Jobs announced that the first iPhone would be released later that year.

Consumers were unable to use any other carrier without unlocking their device.\\r\\nApple retained control of the design, manufacturing and marketing of the iPhone.[24] Since some customers were jailbreaking their iPhones to leave their network, AT&T began charging them a $175 early-termination fee for leaving before the end of their contract.[25]\\r\\nQuestions arose about the legality of Apple's arrangement after the iPhone was released.[26] Two class-action lawsuits were filed against the company in October 2007: one in Federal court and the other in state court.[27] According to the suits, Apple's exclusive agreement with AT&T violated antitrust law.[28]\\r\\nThe state-court suit, filed by the law office of Damian R. Fernandez on behalf of California resident Timothy P. Smith,[28] sought an injunction barring Apple from selling iPhones with a software lock and $200 million in damages.[29] In Smith v.

Ten days later, after the video had been viewed more than 3 million times on the Internet,[63] and had received international news coverage, AT&T sent iPhone users a text message outlining changes in its billing practices.[64]\\r\\nOn September 5, 2007, the 4GB model was discontinued, and the 8GB model price was cut by a third, from US $599 to US $399.[65] Those who had purchased an iPhone in the 14-day period before the September 5, 2007 announcement were eligible for a US $200 \\"price protection\\" rebate from Apple or AT&T. However, it was widely reported that some who bought between the June 29, 2007 launch and the August 22, 2007 price protection kick-in date complained that this was a larger-than-normal price drop for such a relatively short period and accused Apple of unfair pricing.[66][67]\\r\\nIn response to customer complaints, on September 6, 2007, Apple CEO Steve Jobs wrote in an open letter to iPhone customers that everyone who purchased an iPhone at the higher price \\"and who is not receiving a rebate or other consideration\\", would receive a US$100 credit to be redeemed towards the purchase of any product sold in Apple's retail or online stores.[68]\\r\\nWith the July 11, 2008 release of the iPhone 3G, Apple and AT&T changed the US pricing model from the previous generation. Following the de facto model for mobile phone service in the United States, AT&T would subsidize a sizable portion of the upfront cost for the iPhone 3G, followed by charging moderately higher monthly fees over a minimum two-year contract.[69]\\r\\nOn November 9, 2007, the iPhone was officially launched in Europe, in the United Kingdom and Germany.[clarify] In the UK, sales go through the UK O2 unit of Telef܇nica, while in Germany, it is offered through Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile division.[clarify] As in the case of the previous launch in the US, customers lined up as much as a day in advance to obtain the much-anticipated phone.[70]\\r\\nApple occasionally produced a limited number of 4GB iPhones for German and UK markets, but they never reached end customers and were used as in-store demo units. Later[when?] most of the units were disposed of.[71]\\r\\nThe initial operating model of locking iPhone owners to one selected carrier has been controversial in Europe. In Germany, Vodafone, an operator competing with the operator that Apple had locked German iPhone sales to (Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile division), brought a legal case[clarify] claiming that the arrangement was against German law. On November 20, 2007, an interim court order resulted in sales of locked iPhones in Germany being temporarily stopped. The iPhone launch in France a few weeks later through the operator Orange faced the same legal issues. Other countries that will pose[clarify] the same problems for the business model revolving around the sale of locked iPhones include Belgium, Italy, Finland, and Brazil.\\r\\nOn December 1, 2007, Tu?mobil, the Slovenian mobile operator,[clarify] started selling \\"unlocked\\" iPhones without an official contract with Apple. The offer caused confusion between Apple Europe, local media, and local Apple representatives.[72]\\r\\nOn May 6, 2008, Telecom Italia announced that it had signed a deal with Apple to sell iPhones in Italy by the end of 2008.[73] It was estimated that it would probably be the second generation iPhone with 3G-UMTS capability.\\r\\nOn May 27, 2008, TeliaSonera released a press release stating that it would start selling iPhones in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia during 2008.[74]\\r\\nOn June 4, 2008, Movistar announced that it had signed a deal with Apple to sell iPhones in Spain beginning on July 11, 2008.[75]\\r\\nOn August 22, 2008, Estonian mobile operator EMT started selling iPhones.[76]\\r\\nOn August 22, 2008, Vodafone Greece released iPhones in the Greek market.[77]\\r\\nOn September 26, 2008, Omnitel released iPhones in Lithuania.[78]\\r\\nOn November 7, 2008, T-Mobile released iPhones in Croatia.[79]\\r\\nOn September 29, 2010, Elisa released the iPhone 4 in Finland.[80]\\r\\nSingTel (in Singapore) and Globe Telecom (in the Philippines) were the first two carriers to launch the iPhone in Southeast Asia. Both carriers launched the iPhone 3G in August 2008.\\r\\nOn March 20, 2009, Telkomsel became the first telecommunications company in Indonesia to offer the iPhone 3G with customizable plans for all Telkomsel customers.[clarify][81] In the same month, Maxis of Malaysia and DiGi both launched the iPhone 3G.[where?]\\r\\nOn October 2011, StarHub launched the iPhone in Singapore. Smart Communications followed suit in December 2011 by launching the iPhone 4S in the Philippines. Smart Communications was the last telecommunications company to carry Apple's iPhone in Southeast Asia.[clarify][82]\\r\\nThe iPhone 3G was released in Australia on July 11, 2008.[83]\\r\\nThe very first iPhone 3G model released on July 11, 2008[clarify] was sold in Auckland, New Zealand to 22-year-old student Jonny Gladwell at 12:01 am NZST.[84] The iPhone 3G was only available to customers on the Vodafone network.[clarify][85] There was criticism from some New Zealand customers when Vodafone announced pricing for the iPhone 3G, as Vodafone was the only network to offer this generation of iPhone.[where?]\\r\\nThe first-generation iPhone was only available for sale in New Zealand through parallel import stores soon after it went on sale in the US. The original models available for sale in New Zealand were unlocked for use on the Vodafone network and could be used with any plan, including pre-paid plans.[86]\\r\\nSubsequent launches of iPhone models in New Zealand have typically been a few weeks after the worldwide release.\\r\\nOn November 8, 2011, Telecom announced that they would offer the iPhone 4S on their network, along with earlier models (the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4).[87]\\r\\nAfter months of high anticipation, the first iPhone to be released in Canada was the iPhone 3G. Rogers Wireless began offering 8 GB and 16 GB models on July 11, 2008. Facing a public backlash,[88] Rogers dropped the price of its service plan from CA$100 to CA$30 per month.[89]\\r\\nThe iPhone 3GS, with the new iOS 3.0 operating system, was released in Canada by Rogers Wireless on June 19, 2009.

The deal was rumoured to be non-exclusive, according to unofficial statements made by MTS and MegaFon. MTS and MegaFon belong to the \\"Russian Big Three\\",[relevant? ÿ discuss] and were expected to release the iPhone 3G at the same time as Beeline. As predicted, MegaFon issued a press release regarding the iPhone 3G release on September 2, 2008.[95]\\r\\nOn November 14, 2008, Vodafone Egypt and Mobinil started selling the iPhone 3G in Egypt. iPhone 3G is priced at EGS3,800 and EGS4,600 for the 8 GB and 16 GB models respectively. Customers must also sign up for one of 3 service plans[clarify] to use the phone.\\r\\nOn September 28, 2009, Orange announced that they were going to become the second operator of the iPhone in the UK, indicating that an exclusive deal that O2 had established with Apple in 2007 had ended. Orange later announced that the iPhone would be released on November 10, with pricing plans starting from S29.36 on contract and S440 for the 3GS 16GB on pay as you go.[clarify][96][97] On the following day, Vodafone UK announced that they would be selling the iPhone by early 2010, becoming the third UK network and Vodafone's 11th country to offer the iPhone.[98]\\r\\nThere had been ongoing speculation in the United States that Apple might offer a CDMA-compatible iPhone for Verizon Wireless.[99] This speculation increased on October 6, 2010, when The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple would begin producing a CDMA-compatible iPhone, with such a model going on sale in early 2011.[100]\\r\\nOn January 8, 2011, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that Verizon Wireless would, on January 11, 2011, officially announce the launch of a CDMA-based iPhone for use on their network.[101] The date in which the Verizon iPhone would go on sale was unknown, though the two most recent[needs update?] iPhone releases were made available within weeks of their launch announcement. Verizon confirmed the announcement on January 11, with an on-sale date of February 10.[102]\\r\\nOn January 11, 2011, Verizon announced that they would start carrying a CDMA version of Apple's iPhone 4 during February 2011. Existing Verizon Wireless customers could pre-order iPhone on February 3. Pricing for the iPhone 4 was $199 for 16GB and $299 for 32GB.[103] The Verizon iPhone 5 released on Friday, September 19, in the United States; it was the first GSM unlocked iPhone,[104] which worked on AT&T and other GSM networks.[clarify]\\r\\nThe international release of iPhone has been staggered over several months. Today, the iPhone is available in most countries.[105]\\r\\n? iPhone offered by multiple carriers under contract from Apple (country not carrier-exclusive)\\r\\n? iPhone offered without contract and without carrier lock\\r\\n MVNO with O2\\r\\nEach iPhone normally prevents access to its media player and web features unless it has been activated as a phone through AT&T or O2. On July 3, 2007, Jon Lech Johansen reported on his blog that he had successfully bypassed this requirement and unlocked iPhone's other features with jailbreaking. He published the software and offsets for others to use.[117]\\r\\nOn August 14, 2007, Gizmodo reported verification of a method to bypass iPhone's SIM lock, allowing the phone to work freely with carriers other than AT&T. This method requires usage of a Turbo SIM card, costing approximately US$80; the method essentially tricks iPhone into believing that it is operating on the AT&T network, even when it is connected natively (not in roaming mode) to another carrier.[118] Australian Personal Computer later published a ten-step guide to unlocking iPhone, using the Turbo SIM method.[119]\\r\\nIn mid-August, UniquePhones announced an unlocking service for iPhone, only to retract the service the following week after receiving a phone call from a lawyer representing AT&T.\\r\\nOn August 24, 2007, George Hotz, a 17-year-old hacker from Glen Rock, New Jersey, broke the lock that ties Apple's iPhone to AT&T's wireless network. He confirmed that he unlocked the phone and was using it on T-Mobile's network. The hack opened up a realm of possibilities for overseas customers because iPhone was only sold in the US at the time. By unlocking it, Hotz opened up the phone to all kinds of phone networks across the world. Hotz posted the hack on his blog. The process is complicated and requires both disassembling iPhone and executing software commands on a personal computer. Hotz, along with four others across the world, reportedly spent about 500 hours unlocking the phone.[120][121]\\r\\nAlso on August 24, 2007, Engadget reported, by way of photos and a video clip, that they were called by the \\"iPhoneSimFree\\" team, who offered to show Engadget a demonstration of unlocking iPhone using a software-only method.[122] Unlike Hotz's hardware hack, the code in this hack was not made available to the general public. Sales of the unlock started on September 10. These sales occurred through several resellers who were able to order \\"keys\\" from iPhoneSimFree, then pass the \\"keys\\" to customers, allowing the customers to use the software.\\r\\nOn September 11, after one day of sales, the iPhone Dev Team announced that they had created a working \\"software unlock\\", and released it to the public for free.[123] Utilizing the existing unlock[clarify] requires some technical knowledge, although a simpler, GUI-based version was under construction. Two free, GUI-based unlocking programs that have been made available are AnySim and iUnlock Reloaded.\\r\\nOn September 24, 2007 Apple issued a warning that future updates could render unlocked iPhones unusable.[124] On September 27, 2007, owners of unlocked iPhones who took advantage of the version 1.1.1 update through iTunes reported that the update rendered the device virtually inoperable.[125] There were also reports that the update even affected some iPhones that were not unlocked,[126] and Engadget found that the firmware update had \\"bricked\\" unhacked iPhones as well. The firmware update relocks iPhones, but on October 11 iPhoneSIMFree announced that they had hacked the 1.1.1 iPhone update, not only unlocking them but also unbricking those iPhones which were bricked by the update.[127]\\r\\nOn October 16, 2007, the iPhone Dev Team released AnySIM 1.1, the free utility that unlocks iPhones. The updated version works on firmware version 1.1.1, but doesn't fix baseband problems caused by updating an unlocked 1.0.2 phone up to 1.1.1.[128]\\r\\nOn October 23, 2007, the iPhone Elite Dev-Team released Revirginizing Tool to rebuild the lock table in the seczone area to repair the damage done by the original anySIM 1.0x unlockers so unlocked 1.0.2 iPhones can upgrade to 1.1.1 without bricking iPhone. The tool is unbricking the previously bricked iPhones.[129]\\r\\nOn November 21, 2007, T-Mobile announced that due to litigation commenced against them by their competitor Vodafone, which resulted in a preliminary injunction preventing T-Mobile from locking the SIM card to T-Mobile in Germany, it will sell the phone \\"unlocked\\" and will offer iPhone without a T-Mobile contract for ?999 (US$1,478) at its shops to customers in Germany until the court renders a decision.[130]\\r\\nBy the end of November, Apple released another version of iPhone firmware, 1.1.2. This version does not have many new features but breaks unlocks.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring Macworld '08, on January 15, Apple released the fifth version of iPhone firmware, 1.1.3; this version repairs loopholes used by \\"iPhone Hackers.\\" The firmware, however, had been compromised prior to release and new security measures were quickly bypassed.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn February 8, 2008, Geohot released the first full software unlock for the 1.1.2 & 1.1.3 OTB iPhones.\\r\\nFor recent information see IPhone SIM unlocking.","input":"When was the first apple i phone made?"},{"output":"Black Warrior River","context":"Tuscaloosa (/t?sk??lu?s?/ TUSK-?-LOO-s?) is a city in and the seat of Tuscaloosa County in west central Alabama (in the southeastern United States).[5] Located on the Black Warrior River at the Atlantic Seaboard fall line of the Piedmont, it is the fifth-largest city in Alabama, with an estimated population of 99,543 in 2016.\\r\\nIncorporated as a town on December 13, 1819, it was named after Tuskaloosa, the chieftain of a Muskogean-speaking people who battled and was defeated by forces of Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto in 1540 in the Battle of Mabila.[6] It served as Alabama's capital city from 1826 to 1846.\\r\\nTuscaloosa is the regional center of industry, commerce, healthcare, and education for the area of west-central Alabama known as West Alabama. It is the principal city of the Tuscaloosa Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Tuscaloosa, Hale and Pickens counties and has an estimated metro population in 2013 of 235,628. Tuscaloosa is also the home of The University of Alabama, Stillman College and Shelton State Community College. While the city attracted international attention when Mercedes-Benz announced it would build its first automotive assembly plant in North America in Tuscaloosa County, the University of Alabama remains the dominant economic and cultural engine in the city.\\r\\nTuscaloosa has been traditionally known as the \\"Druid City\\" because of the numerous water oaks planted in its downtown streets since the 1840s.[7] The city has also become known nationally for the University of Alabama's success in sports, and particularly in football. City leaders adopted the moniker \\"The City of Champions\\" after the Alabama Crimson Tide football team won the BCS National Championship in their 2009, 2011, and again in their 2012 seasons. The Tide won the College Football Playoff in the 2015 season.\\r\\nIn 2008, the City of Tuscaloosa hosted the USA Olympic Triathlon trials for the Beijing Games.[8]\\r\\nIn recent years, Tuscaloosa has been named the \\"Most Livable City in America,\\" one of America's \\"100 Best Communities for Young People,\\" one of the \\"50 Best College Towns,\\" and one of the \\"Best Places to Launch a Small Business.\\"[9][10][11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly 12,000 years ago, Native Americans or Paleo-Indians arrived in what today is referred to as the Deep South.[13] They were hunter-gatherers who pursued the megafauna that became extinct following the end of the Pleistocene age. After thousands of years, successive indigenous cultures developed a rich and complex agricultural society. Archaeologists called these people the Mississippians of the Mississippian culture; they were Mound Builders. Their large earthworks, built for political and religious rituals roughly from 900AD to 1500AD, expressed their cosmology. Their earthwork mounds and great plazas survive throughout the valleys of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, as well as their tributaries in the Southeast.\\r\\nDescendant Native American tribes include the Creek (Muskogee people). Also among the historical tribes living in the area of present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee in the interior, believed to have migrated south centuries before from the Great Lakes area. The tribes of the coastal plain and Piedmont included the Muskogean-speaking Alabama (Alibamu), Chickasaw, Choctaw, Koasati, and Mobile.[14]\\r\\nIn 1828, Andrew Jackson was elected president of the United States. He had gained popularity when he defeated the Creek at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814, following victories in the War of 1812. He long proposed Indian removal to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi, to make land available for European-American settlement.[15] Jackson abandoned the policy of his predecessors of treating different Indian groups as separate nations.[15] Instead, he aggressively pursued plans to move all Indian tribes living east of the Mississippi River.[15] Following the Indian Removal Act, in 1832 the Creek National Council signed the Treaty of Cusseta, ceding their remaining lands east of the Mississippi to the U.S., and accepting relocation to the Indian Territory. Most Muscogee-speaking peoples were removed to Indian Territory during the Trail of Tears in 1834, although some remained behind. Some Muscogee in Alabama live near Poarch Creek Reservation in Atmore (northeast of Mobile).\\r\\nThe pace of white settlement in the Southeast increased greatly after the War of 1812 and the Treaty of Fort Jackson. A small assortment of log cabins soon arose near the large Creek village at the fall line of the river, which the new settlers named in honor of the sixteenth-century Chief Tuskaloosa of a Muskogean-speaking tribe. In 1817, Alabama became a territory, and on December 13, 1819, the territorial legislature incorporated the town of Tuscaloosa,[1] one day before Congress admitted Alabama to the Union as a state.\\r\\nFrom 1826 to 1846, Tuscaloosa was the capital of Alabama. During this period, in 1831, the University of Alabama was established. The town's population and economy grew rapidly until the departure of the capital to Montgomery caused a rapid decline in population. Establishment of the Bryce State Hospital for the Insane in Tuscaloosa in the 1850s helped restore the city's fortunes.\\r\\nDuring the Civil War following Alabama's secession from the Union, several thousand men from Tuscaloosa fought in the Confederate armies. During the last weeks of the War, a brigade of Union troops raiding the city burned the campus of the university. The larger town was also damaged in the battle and shared fully in the South's economic sufferings which followed the defeat.\\r\\nIn the 1890s the construction of a system of locks and dams on the Black Warrior River by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened up an inexpensive link to the Gulf seaport of Mobile, stimulating especially the mining and metallurgical industries of the region. By the advent of the 20th century, the growth of the University of Alabama and the mental health-care facilities in the city, along with a strong national economy fueled a steady growth in Tuscaloosa which continued unabated for 100 years.\\r\\nIn 1952, Autherine Lucy was admitted to the University as a graduate student, but her admission was rescinded when authorities discovered she was not white. After three years of legal wrangling, Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP got a court order preventing the University from banning Lucy and another student based on race. The following year, Lucy enrolled as a graduate student in Library Science on February 3, 1956, becoming the first African American ever admitted to a white public school or university in the state.[16][17] Her first day of class on February 6 was met by riots on the campus, a mob of more than a thousand men pelting the car in which she rode between classes. Death threats were made against her and the University president's home was stoned.[18] The riots were the most violent involving a pro-segregation demonstration since the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision. After the riots, the University suspended Lucy from school stating her own safety was a concern, later expelling her on a technicality. She was active in Civil Rights for a short while, but ended her involvement later that year. After her expulsion was annulled by the University in 1988, Lucy reenrolled and completed her M.S. in Library Science in 1992.\\r\\nOn June 11, 1963, George Wallace, the governor of Alabama, stood in front of the Foster Auditorium entrance at The University of Alabama in what became known as the Stand in the Schoolhouse Door in an attempt to stop desegregation of that institution by the enrollment of two African-American students, Vivian Malone and James Hood; when confronted by US Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and federal marshals sent in by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, Wallace stepped aside. President John F. Kennedy had called for the integration of the University of Alabama as well.[19][20]\\r\\nOn June 9, 1964, in an event which later became known as Bloody Tuesday, a group of peaceful African-American Civil rights marchers were beaten, arrested and tear gassed by police while walking from the First African Baptist Church to the County Courthouse to protest against segregated restrooms and drinking fountains in the Courthouse.[21] Thirty-three people were sent to the hospital and 94 were arrested. The events were not witnessed by journalists and had little impact outside the local community, unlike the Bloody Sunday events in Selma a year later.[22]\\r\\nAlthough Hood dropped out of school after two months, he subsequently returned and, in 1997, received his Ph.D. in philosophy. Malone persisted in her studies and became the first African American to graduate from the university. In 2000, the university granted her a doctorate of humane letters. Later in his life, Wallace apologized for his opposition at that time to racial integration.\\r\\nIn 2010, the university formally honored Lucy, Hood and Malone by rechristening the plaza in front of Foster Auditorium as Malone-Hood Plaza and erecting a clock towerAutherine Lucy Clock Towerin the plaza.\\r\\nOn April 27, 2011, Tuscaloosa was hit by a 1.5?mi (2.4?km) wide EF4 tornado that resulted in 64 deaths, over 1500 injuries, and massive devastation. 44 of the fatalities were in Tuscaloosa alone, with the rest being in Birmingham and surrounding suburbs.[23][24][25] Its top winds were estimated by the US National Weather Service at 190?mph (310?km/h).[23][26][27] Officials at DCH Regional Medical alone reported treating more than 1000 injured people in the tornado aftermath.[28] Officials reported dozens of unaccompanied minors being admitted for treatment at the hospital, raising questions about the possible loss of their parents. Several were taken to pediatric trauma wards, indicating serious injuries.[28] Referring to the extent and severity of the damage, Mayor Walter Maddox stated that \\"we have neighborhoods that have been basically removed from the map.\\"[29] The same tornado later went on to cause major damage in the Birmingham area.[25] In all, the cost of damage from the tornado amounted to $2.45 billion, making it, at the time, the costliest tornado in U.S. history, though it would be surpassed less than a month later by the devastating Joplin, Missouri tornado of May 22.[30]\\r\\nThe tornado was part of the larger 2011 Super Outbreak which affected large parts of the eastern United States.\\r\\nIn the immediate aftermath of the tornado, thousands of rescue workers dug through the wreckage looking for survivors and recovering bodies. More than 450 were originally listed as missing in the post-disaster chaos, leading to fears that the death toll could skyrocket to the hundreds and skepticism about the relatively slow fatality figures with respect to the number of casualties. Rumors abounded about refrigerated trucks being brought to store unidentified remains and countless bodies at the bottom of area bodies of water. However, the fatality figure did not increase (in fact, it decreased) and most missing persons were later found to have survived.[31] During this period, The Tuscaloosa News posted an on-line people finder to aid loved ones and friends in finding one another and to determine who was still missing.[32]\\r\\nTwo days after the storm, US president Barack Obama and Alabama governor Robert Bentley, and their spouses, Michelle Obama and Diane Bentley, respectively, accompanied Mayor Maddox on a tour of the damage and the recovery efforts, along with FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate and several Congressional dignitaries. Remarking about the scale and severity of the damage, Obama stated, \\"I've never seen devastation like this, it's heartbreaking\\" after touring the damaged areas.[33] Obama pledged the full resources of the federal government toward aiding the recovery efforts[34] Bentleyhimself a Tuscaloosa nativepledged additional national guard troops.\\r\\nTuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox announced that he was requesting 500 additional National Guard troops as well as calling for more volunteer aid workers and cadaver teams for the recovery of bodies in order to prevent the spread of disease.[31]\\r\\nThe New York Yankees organization contributed $500,000 to the American Red Cross and Salvation Army to aid in recovery efforts, and the Atlanta Braves organization donated $100,000.[35] Actor Charlie Sheen visited the city to pay his respects on May 2 and donated supplies for relief efforts, along with several other actors, musicians and athletes.[36]\\r\\nDue to the disaster, on August 6, 2011, the University of Alabama held a delayed graduation ceremony for the class of 2011 and awarded six students who died in the tornado posthumous degrees.[37] The cable channel ESPN has also filmed a tribute in memory of the devastation.[38]\\r\\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, Tuscaloosa has a total area of 70.3 square miles (182?km2), of which 60.2 square miles (156?km2) is land and 10.1 square miles (26?km2) is water. Most water within the city limits is in Lake Tuscaloosa, which is entirely in the city limits, and the Black Warrior River.\\r\\nTuscaloosa is located at 331224N 87325W? / ?33.20667N 87.53472W? / 33.20667; -87.53472 (33.206540, ?87.534607),[39] approximately 60 miles (97?km) southwest of Birmingham. It lies on the fall line of the Black Warrior River approximately 193 miles (311?km) upriver from the river's confluence with the Tombigbee River at Demopolis. Because of its location on the boundary between the Appalachian Highland and the Gulf Coastal Plain, the geography of the area around Tuscaloosa is diverse, varying from heavily forested hills to the northeast to a low-lying, marshy plain to the southwest.\\r\\nThe six major areas of Tuscaloosa are:\\r\\nTypical of the Deep South, Tuscaloosa experiences a humid subtropical climate (K?ppen Cfa) with four distinct seasons. The Gulf of Mexico heavily influences the climate by supplying the region with warm, moist air. During the fall, winter, and spring seasons, the interaction of this warm, moist air with cooler, drier air from the North along fronts create precipitation. These fronts usually move from west to east as they track along the jet stream. Notable exceptions occur during hurricane season where storms may move from due south to due north or even from east to west during land-falling hurricanes. The interaction between low- and high-pressure air masses is most pronounced during the severe weather seasons in the spring and fall. During the summer, the jet streams flows well to the north of the southeastern U.S., and most precipitation is consequently convectional, i.e., caused by the warm surface heating the air above. Severe thunderstorms can bring damaging winds, large hail and occasionally tornadoes. An F4 tornado struck Tuscaloosa County in December 2000, killing eleven people. Tuscaloosa City was struck by an F2 tornado in January 1997 which resulted in the death of one person. In April 2011, two tornadoes in a span of twelve days hit the city, the first being an EF3 on April 15, and the second and more devastating being an EF4 on April 27, where over 50 fatalities occurred. According to Mayor Walter Maddox, considerable infrastructure damage was done to the city.[40]\\r\\nWinter lasts from mid-December to late-February; the daily average temperature in January is 44.7?F (7.1?C). On average, the low temperature falls to the freezing mark or below on 46 days a year, and to or below 20?F (?7?C) on 4.4 days.[41] While rain is abundant (January and February are on average the wettest months), measurable snowfall is rare, with most years receiving none and the average seasonal snowfall amounting to 0.7 inches (1.8?cm).[41] Spring usually lasts from late-February to mid-May, becoming drier as the season progresses. Summers last from mid-May to mid-September, and the July daily average temperature is 81.7?F (27.6?C). There are 71ÿ72 days of 90?F (32?C)+ highs annually and 3.5 days of 100?F (38?C)+ highs.[41] The latter part of summer tends to be drier.

They form a chain of narrow reservoirs, providing aids to navigation and barge handling as well as hydroelectric power and drinking water. The Black Warrior River watershed is a vital river basin entirely contained within Alabama, America's leading state for freshwater biodiversity. Near Tuscaloosa, the river flows out of the rocky Cumberland Plateau and enters the sandy East Gulf Coastal Plain. Barge transportation in and out of the Port of Tuscaloosa and other commercial navigation make the Black Warrior a silent giant in the state of Alabama's economy. Though the Port of Tuscaloosa is a small one, it is one of the larger facilities on the Black Warrior River at waterway mile marker 338.5. There are no railway connections at this port as they primarily concentrate on the shipment of dry bulk commodities, including lignite, coal and coal coke. The federal government and the City of Tuscaloosa share the ownership of the Port of Tuscaloosa; the operation of the port is leased out to Powell Sales and has been run by them since 1997.\\r\\nAt waterway mile marker 343.2 on the opposite side of the river is a steel company with its own tracks at the rear of the plant connecting with the Kansas City Southern Railroad for barge shipments of iron and steel products such as ingots, bars, rods, steel slabs, plates and coils. Tuscaloosa Steel Corporation was one of the first U.S. steel companies to implement the Steckel Mill Technology.\\r\\nThe Port of Tuscaloosa grew out of the system of locks and dams on the Black Warrior River built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the 1890s. Its construction opened up an inexpensive transportation link to the Gulf seaport of Mobile, Alabama that stimulated the mining and metallurgical industries of the region that are still in operation.[73]\\r\\nThe Army Corps of Engineers has maintained a system of locks and dams along the Black Warrior River for over a century to allow navigability all the way up to Birmingham. Barge traffic thus routinely runs through Tuscaloosa to the Alabama State Docks at Mobile, on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Via the Tenn-Tom Waterway, the city is connected to the Ohio River valley and beyond.\\r\\nSome of the more notable points of interest in the city of Tuscaloosa include:\\r\\nThe Tuscaloosa Sister Cities Commission was formed in 1986.

When he learned of his mother's murder, Bosch, then living at a youth hall, dived to the bottom of the pool, screamed until he ran out of air and then swam back to the surface. This event is referenced in several Bosch novels. He joined the United States Army when he was seventeen years old, after getting his foster father to sign the enlistment papers that gave his consent for his minor foster son.\\r\\nIn Vietnam, Bosch was a \\"tunnel rat\\" (nicknamed Hari Kari Bosch), with the 1st Infantry Divisiona specialized soldier whose job it was to go into the maze of tunnels used as barracks, hospitals, and on some occasions, morgues, by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army.[1] While in the enemy tunnels, the Tunnel Rats would kill enemy soldiers they encountered, gather documents for analysis by military intelligence, and then plant C-4 high explosive charges that they would set to detonate after they exited the tunnels. Once, while on R&R leave in Hawaii, Bosch went AWOL but returned to his unit and served two tours of duty in Vietnam.\\r\\nBosch has a daughter named Maddie. Maddie spent most of her time with her mother, Bosch's ex-wife Eleanor, in Hong Kong, seeing him only twice a year. Eleanor, who was a star attraction at a Macau casino, had a personal security guard, Sun Yee, who was also her boyfriend. She was killed during an attempt to rescue Maddie from Chinese thugs. Maddie then started to live with her father in Los Angeles.\\r\\nAfter his return from Vietnam and an honorable discharge from the Army, Bosch joined the LAPD and rose to the rank of Detective III, a position which entails both investigative and supervisory duties and is the LAPD equivalent of Detective Sergeant.\\r\\nWhile in the LAPD, Bosch worked in the prestigious Robbery Homicide Division (RHD) for five years, but was drummed out by an Internal Affairs Division (IAD) investigation involving Bosch's shooting of a suspect (The Dollmaker) who was later linked to nine murders. Following the IAD investigation, which was conducted by Detectives Pierce Lewis and Don Clarke, Bosch was sent to Hollywood Division and assigned to the homicide desk. Lewis and Clarke also investigated Bosch in The Black Echo. At one point, Bosch left the LAPD and worked as a private investigator for three years. He left retirement and returned to the LAPD at the conclusion of The Narrows. After his return, Bosch was assigned to RHD's Open-Unsolved Unit, a cold case squad. Bosch transferred out of Open-Unsolved and into Homicide Special during the time between Echo Park and The Overlook.\\r\\nDuring his time in the LAPD as covered in the novels, Bosch was in Hollywood homicide and worked with Frankie Sheehan (Bosch's partner in RHD, who was later murdered in Angels Flight), Jerry Edgar (his longest serving partner) and Kizmin 'Kiz' Rider, the other members of Bosch's team in Hollywood homicide. The 2004 Limited Edition DVD that was available with The Narrows included an excerpt of a speech real-life LAPD Chief William Bratton made at the Police Academy, in which he publicly asked Harry Bosch to return from retirement (Connelly was on the stand behind listening to the speech; see Blue Neon Night: Michael Connelly's Los Angeles). In The Overlook, Connelly gave Bratton an approving endorsement (albeit without using his name) for \\"raising the morale of the rank and file\\" and for giving \\"Bosch his job back\\" (pp.?145ÿ146 of the Vision paperback edition).\\r\\nIn The Closers, Bosch was once again partnered with Rider, while Edgar remained in Hollywood homicide. Bosch remained partnered with Rider until her transfer to the Chief's office after being shot during Echo Park. During The Overlook, Bosch partnered with Detective Ignacio 'Iggy' Ferras, a younger detective with whom Bosch had not yet developed a solid rapport. Not a stranger to being second-guessed, Bosch was investigated by the LAPD's IAD multiple times, and was always cleared.\\r\\nBosch lived in a house on stilts at 7203 Woodrow Wilson Drive[2] in the Hollywood Hills. The money that financed Bosch's home came from a production studio for a TV mini-series in which actor Dan Lacey portrays Bosch in a case the detective had worked that involved a serial killer; Bosch worked as a technical advisor on the mini-series. His house was later damaged during the Northridge earthquake shortly before the book The Last Coyote. After his house was condemned and demolished, he had a new one built on the same road, still facing out over the valley.\\r\\nBosch has an active love life, with usually one love interest per book. He has a daughter, who, as of 9 Dragons, is living with him. She had lived with her mother, Harry's ex-wife Eleanor Wish (a former FBI agent, ex-con and professional poker player, whom Bosch met in The Black Echo and married while on a case in Las Vegas, and who left Bosch in Angels Flight), who was killed in Hong Kong. Recent stories find Bosch linked in a close relationship with FBI agent Rachel Walling. The liaison formulated in The Narrows and heightened romantically during Echo Park, but Walling broke off the relationship at its conclusion. Walling returned in The Overlook on a strictly professional basis, and she has since resumed a relationship with reporter Jack McEvoy. Walling notes in The Scarecrow that her relationship with Bosch broke up in part because Bosch was still in love with Eleanor Wish.\\r\\nBosch is left-handed. He stands a few inches short of six feet and is described as wiry. His muscles are like nylon cords, strength concealed by economy of scale. He has a moustache and has brown hair that is by now graying (The Black Echo). Bosch's eyes are the other key aspect of his appearance; they are brown and nearly black, and were mentioned often for this reason in A Darkness More Than Night. Connelly gives a good clue as to how he visualizes Bosch when, in The Overlook, Rachel Walling tells Bosch that \\"You look like House\\" (actor Hugh Laurie).\\r\\nBosch is always finding himself in conflict with authority, whether with his lieutenant, or a deputy chief of police (specifically Irvin Irving, Bosch's recurring nemesis until forced to retire at the end of The Closers, and now a city councilman), or the FBI. His confrontational side is usually attributed to his strong sense of right and wrong, coupled with little regard for his career. At the end of The Overlook, Connelly states this trait can be described in a single word: \\"relentless\\". He also uses this word in Lost Light, describing jazz, and implying reference to his own work and personality.\\r\\nBosch has a half-brother, Mickey Haller, a Los Angeles attorney who makes his first appearance in the novel The Lincoln Lawyer, although he briefly appears in a flashback in The Black Ice as a boy. Haller is the legitimate son of the attorney who fathered Bosch. In the second Mickey Haller novel, The Brass Verdict, it is revealed that Harry Bosch has known for years of the relationship, but Haller was unaware of it until the end of the book.[3]\\r\\nBosch's namesake, the Dutch painter, was famous for his religious portrayal of earthly sins (mostly debauchery) and their violent consequences. In several of the books there are parallels suggested between the hell in the paintings and the events of the fictional Bosch's life.\\r\\nBesides the Connelly series, Harry Bosch has made cameos in several other authors' books. Bosch has appeared in books by Paula Woods, Joe Gores, and Robert Crais.[4] Likewise, during an October 16, 2008 book-signing in San Mateo, California, to promote The Brass Verdict, Michael Connelly informed the audience that Bosch also appeared in a cameo without identification in Connelly's novel Chasing the Dime.\\r\\nBosch carried a Smith & Wesson Model 5906 9mm semiautomatic pistol as his duty weapon for many years. The S&W Model 5906 is authorized by the LAPD for duty carry by its officers. It was a popular weapon in the LAPD prior to the North Hollywood shootout. He kept a Heckler & Koch P7 9mm semiautomatic pistol at his house, in the front closet wrapped in an oil wrap, as a back-up weapon. When he retired from the police department, he carried a Glock 27 .40 Caliber semiautomatic subcompact pistol. When he returned to active duty with the LAPD, he started to carry a Kimber Ultra Carry II .45 ACP Caliber semiautomatic pistol. Many officers in the LAPD started carrying .45 caliber pistols after the North Hollywood Shootout bank robbery incident. The LAPD authorized the heavier caliber pistol ammunition for its officers in response to officers facing heavily armed bandits in the North Hollywood shootout. In \\"The Burning Room\\", Bosch starts carrying a Glock 30, .45 ACP caliber, semiautomatic pistol. He still kept the Kimber .45 as his second pistol but uses the Glock as his duty weapon. He had an additional handgun, a Smith & Wesson .44-caliber revolver, in The Black Ice. It was given to him by the father of a murdered girl. It was kept at home, but he took it with him on his trip to Mexico to have a gun which he could check at the border crossing so as to show he had not carried it into Mexico. That done, he hid his carry gun, the 9mm S&W pistol, under the spare tire of his Chevy Caprice. The cop at the border station observed that the left-handed Harry was checking in a right-handed revolver.\\r\\nIn February 2015, Amazon Prime showed the series Bosch, based on the novels. The ten-episode series starred Titus Welliver as Harry Bosch, with Annie Wersching and Jamie Hector co-starring as Officer Julia Brasher and Det. Jerry Edgar respectively. Henrik Bastin of Fabrik Entertainment produced and Jim McKay directed. The series followed Bosch \\"as he pursues the killer of a 12-year-old boy while standing trial in federal court on accusations that he murdered a suspected serial killer in cold blood.\\"[8]\\r\\nAccording to Connelly, a number of changes were made \\"to the world of Harry Bosch ... in making the shift from page to screen\\". In the series, Harry \\"is 47 years old and a veteran of the first Gulf War in 1991, where he was part of a Special Forces team that cleared tunnels. He has now been a police officer for twenty years with a one-year exception when he re-upped with the Army after 9/11, as many LAPD officers did. He came back to the force after serving in Afghanistan and again encountering tunnel warfare.\\"[9]\\r\\nA \\"13 day shoot\\" on the pilot episode of the series began in Los Angeles on 4 November 2013, while Connelly kept a daily \\"set journal\\".[10] The pilot was released on Amazon Prime in February 2014, and the full series was shown in February 2015.[11][12] On March 18, 2015, Bosch was renewed for a second season,[13] which takes inspiration from Connelly's novels Trunk Music, The Drop, and The Last Coyote.[14] The second season premiered on March 11, 2016. Amazon renewed Bosch for a third season soon after the second season was released, which will adapt novels The Black Echo and elements of A Darkness More Than Night. The third season premiered on April 21, 2017.[15] On October 16, 2016, Bosch was renewed for a fourth season.[16]","input":"Who is the mother of harry bosch's daughter?"},{"output":"polymorphic","context":"The loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), or loggerhead, is an oceanic turtle distributed throughout the world. It is a marine reptile, belonging to the family Cheloniidae. The average loggerhead measures around 90?cm (35?in) long when fully grown, although larger specimens of up to 280?cm (110?in) have been discovered. The adult loggerhead sea turtle weighs approximately 135?kg (298?lb), with the largest specimens weighing in at more than 450?kg (1,000?lb). The skin ranges from yellow to brown in color, and the shell is typically reddish brown. No external differences in sex are seen until the turtle becomes an adult, the most obvious difference being the adult males have thicker tails and shorter plastrons (lower shells) than the females.\\r\\nThe loggerhead sea turtle is found in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. It spends most of its life in saltwater and estuarine habitats, with females briefly coming ashore to lay eggs. The loggerhead sea turtle has a low reproductive rate; females lay an average of four egg clutches and then become quiescent, producing no eggs for two to three years. The loggerhead reaches sexual maturity within 17ÿ33 years and has a lifespan of 47ÿ67 years.\\r\\nThe loggerhead sea turtle is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Its large and powerful jaws serve as an effective tool for dismantling its prey. Young loggerheads are exploited by numerous predators; the eggs are especially vulnerable to terrestrial organisms. Once the turtles reach adulthood, their formidable size limits predation to large marine animals, such as sharks.\\r\\nLoggerheads are considered an vulnerable species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. In total, 9 distinct population segments are under the protection of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, with 4 population segments classified as \\"threatened\\" and 5 classified as \\"endangered\\"[5] Commercial trade of loggerheads or derived products is prohibited by CITES Appendix I. Untended fishing gear is responsible for many loggerhead deaths. Turtles may also suffocate if they are trapped in fishing trawls. Turtle excluder devices have been implemented in efforts to reduce mortality by providing an escape route for the turtles. Loss of suitable nesting beaches and the introduction of exotic predators have also taken a toll on loggerhead populations. Efforts to restore their numbers will require international cooperation, since the turtles roam vast areas of ocean and critical nesting beaches are scattered across several countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loggerhead sea turtle is the world's largest hard-shelled turtle, slightly larger at average and maximum mature weights than the green sea turtle and the Galapagos tortoise. It is also the world's second largest extant turtle after the leatherback sea turtle.[6][7][8] Adults have an average weight range of 80 to 200?kg (180 to 440?lb) and a length range of 70 to 95?cm (28 to 37?in).[6] The maximum reported weight is 545?kg (1,202?lb) and the maximum carapace length is 213?cm (84?in).[6] The head and carapace (upper shell) range from a yellow-orange to a reddish brown, while the plastron (underside) is typically pale yellow.[9] The turtle's neck and sides are brown on the tops and yellow on the sides and bottom.[10]\\r\\nThe turtle's shell is divided into two sections: carapace and plastron. The carapace is further divided into large plates, or scutes.[9] Typically, 11 or 12 pairs of marginal scutes rim the carapace.[11] Five vertebral scutes run down the carapace's midline, while five pairs of costal scutes border them.[12] The nuchal scute is located at the base of the head.[12] The carapace connects to the plastron by three pairs of inframarginal scutes forming the bridge of the shell.[12] The plastron features paired gular, humeral, pectoral, abdominal, femoral, and anal scutes.[11] The shell serves as external armor, although loggerhead sea turtles cannot retract their heads or flippers into their shells.[13]\\r\\nSexual dimorphism of the loggerhead sea turtle is only apparent in adults. Adult males have longer tails and claws than females. The males' plastrons are shorter than the females', presumably to accommodate the males' larger tails. The carapaces of males are wider and less domed than the females', and males typically have wider heads than females.[14] The sex of juveniles and subadults cannot be determined through external anatomy, but can be observed through dissection, laparoscopy (an operation performed on the abdomen), histological examination (cell anatomy), and radioimmunological assays (immune study dealing with radiolabeling).[14]\\r\\nLachrymal glands located behind each eye allow the loggerhead to maintain osmotic balance by eliminating the excess salt obtained from ingesting ocean water. On land, the excretion of excess salt gives the false impression that the turtle is crying.[15]\\r\\nThe loggerhead sea turtle has a cosmopolitan distribution, nesting over the broadest geographical range of any sea turtle. It inhabits the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea.[16]\\r\\nIn the Atlantic Ocean, the greatest concentration of loggerheads is along the southeastern coast of North America and in the Gulf of Mexico. Very few loggerheads are found along the European and African coastlines.[17] Florida is the most popular nesting site, with more than 67,000 nests built per year. Nesting extends as far north as Virginia, as far south as Brazil, and as far east as the Cape Verde Islands. The Cape Verde Islands are the only significant nesting site on the eastern side of the Atlantic. Loggerheads found in the Atlantic Ocean feed from Canada to Brazil.[16]\\r\\nIn the Indian Ocean, loggerheads feed along the coastlines of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and in the Arabian Sea.[18] Along the African coastline, loggerheads nest from Mozambique's Bazaruto Archipelago to South Africa's St Lucia estuary.[19] The largest Indian Ocean nesting site is Oman, on the Arabian Peninsula, which hosts around 15,000 nests, giving it the second largest nesting population of loggerheads in the world. Western Australia is another notable nesting area, with 1,000ÿ2,000 nests per year.[18]\\r\\nPacific loggerheads live in temperate to tropical regions.[19] They forage in the East China Sea, the southwestern Pacific, and along the Baja California Peninsula. Eastern Australia and Japan are the major nesting areas, with the Great Barrier Reef deemed an important nesting area.[20] Pacific loggerheads occasionally nest in Vanuatu and Tokelau. Yakushima Island is the most important site, with three nesting grounds visited by 40% of all nearby loggerheads.[18] After nesting, females often find homes in the East China Sea, while the Kuroshio Current Extension's Bifurcation region provides important juvenile foraging areas.[19] Eastern Pacific populations are concentrated off the coast of Baja California, where upwelling provides rich feeding grounds for juvenile turtles and subadults. Nesting sites along the eastern Pacific Basin are rare. mtDNA sequence polymorphism analysis and tracking studies suggest 95% of the population along the coast of the Americas hatch on the Japanese Islands in the western Pacific.[21] The turtles are transported by the prevailing currents across the full length of the northern Pacific, one of the longest migration routes of any marine animal.[21] The return journey to the natal beaches in Japan has been long suspected, although the trip would cross unproductive clear water with few feeding opportunities.[22] Evidence of a return journey came from an adult female loggerhead named Adelita, which in 1996, equipped with a satellite tracking device, made the 14,500?km (9,000?mi) trip from Mexico across the Pacific. Adelita was the first animal of any kind ever tracked across an ocean basin.[23]\\r\\nThe Mediterranean Sea is a nursery for juveniles, as well as a common place for adults in the spring and summer months.[17][24] Almost 45% of the Mediterranean juvenile population has migrated from the Atlantic.[17] Loggerheads feed in the Alboran Sea and the Adriatic Sea.[17] Greece is the most popular nesting site along the Mediterranean, with more than 3,000 nests per year.[18] Zakynthos hosts the largest Mediterranean nesting with the second one being in Kyparissia Bay.[25] Because of this, Greek authorities do not allow planes to take off or land at night in Zakynthos due to the nesting turtles.[26] In addition to the Greek coast, the coastlines of Cyprus and Turkey are also common nesting sites.[18]\\r\\nOne record of this turtle was made in Ireland when a specimen washed ashore on Ballyhealy Beach in Co. Wexford.[27]\\r\\nLoggerhead sea turtles spend most of their lives in the open ocean and in shallow coastal waters. They rarely come ashore besides the females' brief visits to construct nests and deposit eggs. Hatchling loggerhead turtles live in floating mats of Sargassum algae.[28] Adults and juveniles live along the continental shelf as well as in shallow coastal estuaries.[29] In the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, age plays a factor in habitat preference. Juveniles are more frequently found in shallow estuarine habitats with limited ocean access compared to non-nesting adults.[30] Loggerheads occupy waters with surface temperatures ranging from 13.3ÿ28?C (56ÿ82?F) during non-nesting season. Temperatures from 27ÿ28?C (81ÿ82?F) are most suitable for nesting females.[31]\\r\\nJuvenile loggerheads share the Sargassum habitat with a variety of other organisms. The mats of Sargassum contain as many as 100 different species of animals on which the juveniles feed. Prey found in Sargassum mats may include barnacles, crab larvae, fish eggs, and hydrozoan colonies. Some prey, such as ants, flies, aphids, leafhoppers, and beetles, are carried by the wind to the mats.[28] Marine mammals and commercial fishes, including tuna and mahi-mahi, also inhabit the Sargassum mats.[32]\\r\\nLoggerhead sea turtles observed in captivity and in the wild are most active during the day. In captivity, the loggerheads' daily activities are divided between swimming and resting on the bottom. While resting, they spread their forelimbs to about midstroke swimming position. They remain motionless with eyes open or half-shut and are easily alerted during this state. At night, captives sleep in the same position with their eyes tightly shut, and are slow to react.[31] Loggerheads spend up to 85% of their day submerged, with males being the more active divers than females. The average duration of dives is 15ÿ30 min, but they can stay submerged for up to four hours.[33] Juvenile loggerheads and adults differ in their swimming methods. A juvenile keeps its forelimbs pressed to the side of its carapace, and propels itself by kicking with its hind limbs. As the juvenile matures, its swimming method is progressively replaced with the adult's alternating-limb method. They depend entirely on this method of swimming by one year old.[34]\\r\\nWater temperature affects the sea turtle's metabolic rate.[31] Lethargy is induced at temperatures between 13 and 15?C (55 and 59?F). The loggerhead takes on a floating, cold-stunned posture when temperatures drop to around 10?C.[31] However, younger loggerheads are more resistant to cold and do not become stunned until temperatures drop below 9?C. The loggerheads' migration helps to prevent instances of cold-stunning.[35] Higher water temperatures cause an increase in metabolism and heart rate. A loggerhead's body temperature increases in warmer waters more quickly than it decreases in colder water; their critical thermal maximum is currently unknown.[35] In February 2015, a live loggerhead turtle was found floating in British Columbian waters of 10.5 C with extensive algal growth on its carapace.[36]\\r\\nFemale-female aggression, which is fairly rare in other marine vertebrates, is common among loggerheads. Ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. Escalation typically follows four steps.[37] First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, sparring occurs with turtles snapping at each others jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions, or involves chasing one out of the immediate vicinity.[37] Escalation is determined by several factors, including hormone levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance of location. At all stages, an upright tail shows willingness to escalate, while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact is much more likely to escalate when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds.[37] Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly territorial, and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species.[33]\\r\\nThe loggerhead sea turtle is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as gastropods, bivalves, and decapods. It has a greater list of known prey than any other sea turtle. Other food items include sponges, corals, sea pens, polychaete worms, sea anemones, cephalopods, barnacles, brachiopods, isopods, Portuguese men o' war, insects, bryozoans, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea cucumbers, starfish, fish (eggs, juveniles, and adults), hatchling turtles (including members of its own species), algae, and vascular plants.[38] During migration through the open sea, loggerheads eat jellyfish, floating molluscs, floating egg clusters, squid, and flying fish.[10]\\r\\nLoggerheads crush prey with their large and powerful jaws.[10][39] Projecting scale points on the anterior margin of the forelimbs allow manipulation of the food. These points can be used as \\"pseudo-claws\\" to tear large pieces of food in the loggerhead's mouth. The loggerhead will turn its neck sideways to consume the torn food on the scale points.[39] Inward-pointing, mucus-covered papillae found in the fore region of the loggerhead's esophagus filter out foreign bodies, such as fish hooks. The next region of the esophagus is not papillated, with numerous mucosal folds. The digestion rate in loggerheads is temperature-dependent; it increases as temperature increases.[39]\\r\\nLoggerheads have numerous predators, especially early in their lives. Egg and nestling predators include ghost crabs, oligochaete worms, beetles, fly larvae, ants, flesh flies, snakes, gulls, corvids, opossums, bears, rats, armadillos, mustelids, skunks, canids, procyonids, cats, pigs, and humans. During their migration from their nests to the sea, hatchlings are preyed on by dipteran larvae, crabs, toads, lizards, snakes, seabirds such as frigatebirds, and other assorted birds and mammals. In the ocean, predators of the loggerhead juveniles include portunid crabs and various fishes, such as parrotfishes and moray eels. Adults are more rarely attacked due to their large size, but may be preyed on by large sharks, seals, and killer whales. Nesting females are attacked by flesh flies, feral dogs, and humans. Salt marsh mosquitos can also pester nesting females.[39][43]\\r\\nIn Australia, the introduction of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) by British settlers in the 19th century led to significant reductions in loggerhead sea turtle populations. In one coastal section in eastern Australia during the 1970s, predation of turtle eggs destroyed up to 95% of all clutches laid.[44] Aggressive efforts to destroy foxes in the 1980s and 1990s has reduced this impact; however, it is estimated that it will be the year 2020 before populations will experience complete recovery from such dramatic losses.[45]\\r\\nAlong the southeastern coast of the United States, the raccoon (Procyon lotor) is the most destructive predator of nesting sites. Mortality rates of nearly 100% of all clutches laid in a season have been recorded on some Florida beaches.[44] This is attributed to an increase in raccoon populations, which have flourished in urban environments. Aggressive efforts to protect nesting sites by covering them with wire mesh has significantly reduced the impact of raccoon predation on loggerhead sea turtle eggs.[45] On Bald Head Island in North Carolina, wire mesh screens are used on every confirmed nest to prevent excavation by resident red foxes. A new concern with the steel cage technique is interference with the normal development of the nestlings' magnetic sense due to the use of ferrous wire, which may disrupt the turtles' ability to navigate properly. Efforts are underway to find a nonmagnetic material that will prevent predators gnawing through the barrier.\\r\\nUp to 40% of nesting females around the world have wounds believed to come from shark attacks.[43]\\r\\nInfectious bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Salmonella attack loggerhead hatchlings and eggs. Fungi such as Penicillium infect loggerhead sea turtle nests and cloacae.[43]\\r\\nFibropapillomatosis disease caused by a form of the herpes-type virus threatens loggerheads with internal and external tumors. These tumors disrupt essential behaviors and, if on the eyes, cause permanent blindness.[46] Trematodes of the family Spirorchiidae inhabit tissues throughout the body of the loggerhead, including vital organs, such as the heart and the brain.[47] Trematode infection can be highly debilitating. For example, inflammatory trematode lesions can cause endocarditis and neurological disease.[47] A nematode, Angiostoma carettae, also infects loggerheads,[48] causing histologic lesions in the respiratory tract.[48]\\r\\nMore than 100 species of animals from 13 phyla, as well as 37 kinds of algae, live on loggerheads' backs.[49] These parasitic organisms, which increase drag, offer no known benefit to the turtle, although the dulling effect of organisms on shell color may improve camouflage.[49]\\r\\nHatchlings range in color from light brown to almost black, lacking the adult's distinct yellows and reds.[9] Upon hatching, they measure about 4.6?cm (1.8?in) and weigh about 20?g (0.7?oz).[10] The eggs are typically laid on the beach in an area above the high-tide line. The eggs are laid near the water so the hatchlings can return to the sea.[50] The loggerhead's sex is dictated by the temperature of the underground nest. Incubation temperatures generally range from 26ÿ32?C (79ÿ90?F). Sea turtle eggs kept at a constant incubating temperature of 32?C become females. Eggs incubating at 28?C become males. An incubation temperature of 30?C results in an equal ratio of male to female hatchlings.[51] Hatchlings from eggs in the middle of the clutch tend to be the largest, grow the fastest, and be the most active during the first few days of sea life.[44]\\r\\nAfter incubating for around 80 days, hatchlings dig through the sand to the surface, usually at night, when darkness increases the chance of escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced.[50] Hatchlings enter the ocean by navigating toward the brighter horizon created by the reflection of the moon and starlight off the water's surface.[52]\\r\\nHatchlings can lose up to 20% of their body mass due to evaporation of water as they journey from nest to ocean.[53] They initially use the undertow to push them five to 10 m away from the shore.[53] Once in the ocean, they swim for about 20 hours, taking them far offshore.[9] An iron compound, magnetite, in their brains allows the turtles to perceive the Earth's magnetic field,[54] for navigation. Many hatchlings use Sargassum in the open ocean as protection until they reach 45?cm (18?in).[9] Hatchling loggerheads live in this pelagic environment until they reach juvenile age, and then they migrate to nearshore waters.[9]\\r\\nWhen ocean waters cool, loggerheads must migrate to warmer areas or hibernate to some degree. In the coldest months, they submerge for up to seven hours at a time, emerging for only seven minutes to breathe. Although outdone by freshwater turtles, these are among the longest recorded dives for any air-breathing marine vertebrate.[55] During their seasonal migration, juvenile loggerheads have the ability to use both magnetic and visual cues.[56] When both aids are available, they are used in conjunction; if one aid is not available, the other suffices.[56] The turtles swim at about 1.6?km/h (0.9?kn; 0.4?m/s) during migration.[57]\\r\\nLike all marine turtles, the loggerhead prepares for reproduction in its foraging area. This takes place several years before the loggerhead migrates to a mating area.[58] Female loggerheads first reproduce at ages 28ÿ33 in Southeastern United States and Australia, and at ages 17ÿ30 in South Africa. Age at first reproduction in the Mediterranean, Oman, Japan, and Brazil are unknown.[59] Nesting loggerheads have a straight carapace length of 70ÿ109?cm (28ÿ43?in). Because of the large range, carapace length is not a reliable indicator of sexual maturity.[60] Their estimated maximum lifespan is 47ÿ67 years in the wild.[38]\\r\\nFemale loggerheads first reproduce between the ages of 17 and 33,[59] and their mating period may last more than six weeks.[58] They court their mates, but these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined.[61] Male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling, biting, and head and flipper movements.[61] Studies suggest females produce cloacal pheromones to indicate reproductive ability.[61] Before mating, the male approaches a female and attempts to mount her, while she resists. Next, the male and female begin to circle each other. If the male has competitors, the female may let the males struggle with each other. The winner then mounts the female; the male's curved claws usually damage the shoulders of the female's shell during this process. Other courting males bite the male while he is attempting to copulate, damaging his flippers and tail, possibly exposing bones. Such damage can cause the male to dismount and may require weeks to heal.[61] While nesting, females produce an average of 3.9 egg clutches, and then become quiescent, producing no eggs for two to three years.[58][62] Unlike other sea turtles, courtship and mating usually do not take place near the nesting beach, but rather along migration routes between feeding and breeding grounds.[61] Recent evidence indicates ovulation in loggerheads is mating-induced.[63] Through the act of mating, the female ovulates eggs which are fertilized by the male. This is unique, as mating-induced ovulation is rare outside of mammals.[63] In the Northern Hemisphere, loggerheads mate from late March to early June. The nesting season is short, between May and August in the Northern Hemisphere and between October and March in the Southern Hemisphere.[60]\\r\\nLoggerheads may display multiple paternity.[64] Multiple paternity is possible due to sperm storage. The female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation.[65] A single clutch may have as many as seven fathers, each contributing sperm to a portion of the clutch.[66] Multiple paternity and female size are positively correlated.[64][66] Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One posits that males favor large females because of their perceived higher fecundity (ability to reproduce).[64] The other states, because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have longer mating periods.[64]\\r\\nAll sea turtles have similar basic nesting behaviors. Females return to lay eggs at intervals of 12ÿ17 days during the nesting season, on or near the beach where they hatched.[61][62] They exit the water, climb the beach, and scrape away the surface sand to form a body pit. With their hind limbs, they excavate an egg chamber in which the eggs are deposited. The females then cover the egg chamber and body pit with sand, and finally return to the sea.[67] This process takes one to two hours, and occurs in open sand areas or on top of sand dunes, preferably near dune grasses that the females can use to camouflage the nest.[62] The nesting area must be selected carefully because it affects characteristics such as fitness, emergence ratio, and vulnerability to nest predators.[50] Loggerheads have an average clutch size of 112.4 eggs.[68]\\r\\nCarl Linnaeus gave the loggerhead its first binomial name, Testudo caretta, in 1758.[3][11] Thirty-five other names emerged over the following two centuries, with the combination Caretta caretta first introduced in 1902 by Leonhard Stejneger.[4] The English common name \\"loggerhead\\" refers to the animal's large head.[10][69] The loggerhead sea turtle belongs to the family Cheloniidae, which includes all extant sea turtles except the leatherback sea turtle.[70] The subspecific classification of the loggerhead sea turtle is debated, but most authors consider it a single polymorphic species.[71] Molecular genetics has confirmed hybridization of the loggerhead sea turtle with the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, hawksbill sea turtle, and green sea turtles. The extent of natural hybridization is not yet determined; however, second-generation hybrids have been reported, suggesting some hybrids are fertile.[72]\\r\\nAlthough evidence is lacking,[73] modern sea turtles probably descended from a single common ancestor during the Cretaceous period. Like all other sea turtles except the leatherback, loggerheads are members of the ancient family Cheloniidae, and appeared about 40 million years ago.[1] Of the six species of living Cheloniidae, loggerheads are more closely related to the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, olive ridley sea turtle, and the hawksbill turtle than they are to the flatback turtle and the green turtle.\\r\\nAround three million years ago, during the Pliocene epoch, Central America emerged from the sea, effectively cutting off currents between the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans. The rerouting of ocean currents led to climatic changes as the Earth entered a glacial cycle. Cold water upwelling around the Cape of Good Hope and reduction in water temperature at Cape Horn formed coldwater barriers to migrating turtles. The result was a complete isolation of the Atlantic and Pacific populations of loggerheads.[74] During the most recent ice age, the beaches of southeastern North America were too cold for sea turtle eggs. As the Earth began to warm, loggerheads moved farther north, colonizing the northern beaches. Because of this, turtles nesting between North Carolina and northern Florida represent a different genetic population from those in southern Florida.[74]\\r\\nThe distinct populations of loggerheads have unique characteristics and genetic differences. For example, Mediterranean loggerheads are smaller, on average, than Atlantic Ocean loggerheads.[18] North Atlantic and Mediterranean loggerhead sea turtles are descendants of colonizing loggerheads from Tongaland, South Africa. South African loggerhead genes are still present in these populations today.[74]\\r\\nMany human activities have negative effects on loggerhead sea turtle populations. The prolonged time required for loggerheads to reach sexual maturity and the high mortality rates of eggs and young turtles from natural phenomena compound the problems of population reduction as a consequence of human activities.[75]\\r\\nLoggerhead sea turtles were once intensively hunted for their meat and eggs; consumption has decreased, however, due to worldwide legislation. Despite this, turtle meat and eggs are still consumed in countries where regulations are not strictly enforced.[76] In Mexico, turtle eggs are a common meal; locals claim the egg is an aphrodisiac.[77] Eating turtle eggs or meat can cause serious illness due to harmful bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens, and high levels of toxic metals that build up through bioaccumulation.[76][78]\\r\\nThe US West Coast is a critical migratory corridor for the Pacific loggerheads, in which these turtles swim across the Pacific to Californias coast from breeding grounds in Japan. Important foraging habitats for juveniles in the central North Pacific have been revealed through telemetry studies.[79] Along with these foraging habitats, high levels of bycatch from industrial-scale fisheries have been found to overlap; with drift gillnets in the past and longline fisheries presently.[79] Many juvenile loggerheads aggregate off the coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico, where small coastal fisheries increase these turtles' mortality risk; fishers have reported catching dozens of loggerheads with bottom-set gear per day per boat.[79] The most common commercial fishery that accidentally takes loggerheads are bottom trawls used for shrimp vessels in the Gulf of California.[80] In 2000, between 2,600 and 6,000 loggerheads were estimated to have been killed by pelagic longlining in the Pacific.[79]\\r\\nFishing gear is the biggest threat to loggerheads in the open ocean. They often become entangled in longlines or gillnets. According to the 2009 status review of loggerheads by the Fisheries Service, drowning from entanglement in longline and gillnet fishing gear is the turtles primary threat in the North Pacific.[80] They also become stuck in traps, pots, trawls, and dredges.[10] Caught in this unattended equipment, loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning. Turtle excluder devices for nets and other traps reduce the number being accidentally caught.\\r\\nNearly 24,000 metric tons of plastic are dumped into the ocean each year. Turtles ingest a wide array of this floating debris, including bags, sheets, pellets, balloons and abandoned fishing line.[81] Loggerheads may mistake the floating plastic for jellyfish, a common food item. The ingested plastic causes numerous health concerns, including intestinal blockage, reduced nutrient absorption and malnutrition, suffocation, ulcerations, or starvation. Ingested plastics release toxic compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, which may accumulate in internal tissues. Such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells, tissue damage, or deviation from natural behaviors.[82]\\r\\nArtificial lighting discourages nesting and interferes with the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources.[50] Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises.[52] Artificial lighting causes tens of thousands of hatchling deaths per year.[83]\\r\\nDestruction and encroachment of habitat by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, forcing them to nest closer to the surf.[62] Urbanization often leads to the siltation of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability.[62] Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles at or near the surface.[46]\\r\\nAnnual variations in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios, since loggerheads have temperature-dependent sex determination. High sand temperatures may skew gender ratios in favor of females. Nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures over a three-year period produced 87ÿ99% females.[84] This raises concern over the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction.[85] A more localized effect on gender skewing comes from the construction of tall buildings, which reduce sun exposure, lowering the average sand temperature, which results in a shift in gender ratios to favor the emergence of male turtles.[62]\\r\\nSince the loggerhead occupies such a broad range, successful conservation requires efforts from multiple countries.[10]\\r\\nLoggerhead sea turtles are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and are listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, making international trade illegal.[10] In the United States, the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service classify them as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.[10] Loggerheads are listed as endangered under both Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992. The Convention on Migratory Species works for the conservation of loggerhead sea turtles on the Atlantic coast of Africa, as well as in the Indian Ocean and southeast Asia.[86][87] Throughout Japan, the Sea Turtle Association of Japan aids in the conservation of loggerhead sea turtles.[88] Greece's ARCHELON works for their conservation.[89] The Marine Research Foundation works for loggerhead conservation in Oman.[90] Annex 2 of the Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife Protocol of the Cartagena Convention, which deals with pollution that could harm marine ecosystems, also protects them.[10][91] Conservation organizations worldwide have worked with the shrimp trawling industry to develop turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) to exclude even the largest turtles. TEDs are mandatory for all shrimp trawlers.[10]\\r\\nIn many places during the nesting season, workers and volunteers search the coastline for nests,[92] and researchers may also go out during the evening to look for nesting females for tagging studies and gather barnacles and tissues samples. Volunteers may, if necessary, relocate the nests for protection from threats, such as high spring tides and predators, and monitor the nests daily for disturbances. After the eggs hatch, volunteers uncover and tally hatched eggs, undeveloped eggs, and dead hatchlings. Any remaining live hatchlings are released or taken to research facilities. Typically, those that lack the vitality to hatch and climb to the surface die.[93] Hatchlings use the journey from nest to ocean to build strength for the coming swim. Helping them to reach the ocean bypasses this strength-building exercise and lowers their chances of survival.[94]\\r\\nThe loggerhead sea turtle appears on the $1000 Colombian Peso coin. In the United States, the loggerhead sea turtle is the official state reptile of South Carolina and also the state saltwater reptile of Florida.[95][96]","input":"What is the classification of a loggerhead sea turtle?"},{"output":"September 10, 2005","context":"Naruto (ϻ) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, an adolescent ninja who searches for recognition from his peers and the village and also dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is in two parts, the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).\\r\\nNaruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankbon (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by Studio Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English adaptation of the series aired on Cartoon Network from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes. The English adaptation was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011, and then switched to Adult Swim's Toonami block in January 2014. Besides the anime series, Studio Pierrot has developed eleven movies and eleven original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies.\\r\\nViz Media licensed the manga and anime for North American production and serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The anime series began airing in the United States and Canada in 2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The films and most OVAs from the series were also released by Viz, with the first film premiering in movie theaters. Viz Media began streaming the two anime series on their streaming service Neon Alley in December 2012. The story of Naruto continues with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations: Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of following his father's.\\r\\nAs of 2017, Naruto is the third best-selling manga series in history, selling more than 220 million copies worldwide in 35 countries outside Japan. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's character development, strong storylines, and well-executed fight scenes, though some felt the fight scenes slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha, the Fourth Hokage, seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making Naruto a host of the beast;[d] this costs Naruto's father his life, and the Third Hokage returns from retirement to become leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often ridiculed by the Konoha villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Because of a decree made by the Third Hokage forbidding anyone to mention these events, Naruto knows nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to Naruto. Naruto then defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher Iruka Umino.[e]\\r\\nShortly afterwards, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers, ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.\\r\\nAfter several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam, enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions. During the exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. Jiraiya, one of the three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches with Naruto for Tsunade whom he chooses to become Fifth Hokage instead.\\r\\nDuring the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic heritage, the Sharingan.[f] After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi[g] when he showed up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength needed to kill Itachi. When Tsunade finds out, she sends a group of ninja, including Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to persuade or force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up on Sasuke: Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare himself for the next time he encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice.\\r\\nTwo and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya. The Akatsuki starts kidnapping the hosts of the powerful Tailed Beasts. Team 7 (and other ninja) fight against them and search for their teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing and extracting seven of the Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts except Gaara (the host of the One-Tail) who is resurrected by an Elder of the Sand village (of which he is the new Kage) at the cost of her life. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke learns from the Akatsuki founder Tobi that Itachi received an order from Konoha's superiors to destroy his clan to prevent a coup d'tat. He accepted it on the condition that he would be allowed to leave Sasuke alive. Saddened by this revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to kill Konoha's superiors and destroy Konoha in revenge. As Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki members, the Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills Jiraiya and devastates Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems him, earning the village's respect and admiration.\\r\\nWith Nagato's eventual death, Tobi, disguised as Madara Uchiha (one of Konoha's founding fathers), announces that he wants to get all nine Tailed Beasts to perform an illusion powerful enough to control all humanity, to create world peace. The leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to help him and instead join forces to confront Tobi and his allies. That decision results in a fourth great ninja war between the combined armies of the Five Great Countries (known as the Allied Shinobi Forces) and Akatsuki's forces of zombie-like ninjas. The Five Kage tries to keep Naruto, unaware of the war, in a secret island turtle near Kumogakure (Hidden Cloud Village), but Naruto finds out and escapes from the island with Killer Bee, the host of the Eight-Tails, and the two of them head for the battlefield.\\r\\nDuring the conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is Obito Uchiha, a former teammate of Kakashi's who was thought to be dead. The real Madara saved Tobi's life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, including the circumstances that led to his clan's downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito's plans. However, Madara's body ends up possessed by Kaguya tsutsuki, an ancient princess who intends to subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her. Once Kaguya is sealed, Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all the Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts Sasuke to dissuade him from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and reforms. After the war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation.\\r\\nIn 1995, Shueisha released Karakuri, a one-shot manga by Masashi Kishimoto that earned an honorable mention in the Hop Step Award in 1996. Kishimoto was unsatisfied with his subsequent drafts for a follow up, and decided to work on another project.[2] The new project was originally going to feature Naruto as a chef, but this version never made it to print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of Naruto for the summer 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump based on the idea.[3][4] Despite the positive feedback it received in a readers' poll, Kishimoto was unhappy with the art and the story, so he rewrote it as a story about ninjas.[5]\\r\\nThe first eight chapters of Naruto were planned before it appeared in Weekly Shnen Jump, and these chapters originally devoted many panels of intricate art to illustrating the Konoha village. By the time Naruto debuted, the background art was sparse, instead emphasizing the characters.[5] Though Kishimoto had concerns that chakra (the energy source used by the ninjas in Naruto) made the series too Japanese, he still believed it is an enjoyable read.[6] Kishimoto is a fan of Godzilla, and the tailed beasts mythology was introduced because Kishimoto wanted an excuse to draw monsters.[7] He has said that the central theme in Part I of Naruto is how people accept each other, citing Naruto's development across the series as an example.[8]\\r\\nFor Part II of the manga, Kishimoto tried to keep the panel layouts and the plot easy for the reader to follow, and avoid \\"overdo[ing] the typical manga style\\".[9] He considers that his drawing style has changed from \\"the classic manga look to something a bit more realistic.\\"[9] Because of wishing to end the arc involving Sasuke Uchiha search for his brother, Itachi, in a single volume, Kishimoto decided that volume 43 should include more chapters than regular volumes. As a result, Kishimoto apologized to readers for this since volume 43 was more expensive than regular volumes.[10]\\r\\nWhen he created Naruto, Kishimoto looked to other shnen manga as influences for his work and tried to make his characters unique, while basing the story on Japanese culture.[11] The separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a particular flavor. Kishimoto wanted each member to have a high level of aptitude in one skill and be talentless in another.[12] He found it difficult to write about romance, but emphasized it more in Part II of the manga, beginning with volume 28.[8] He introduced villains into the story to have them act as a counterpoint to his characters' moral values and clearly illustrate their differences.[13] As a result of how the younger characters were significantly weaker than the villains, Kishimoto made the team skip in order to have them age and become stronger during this time.[14]\\r\\nKishimoto made use of the Chinese zodiac tradition, which had a long-standing presence in Japan; the zodiac hand signs originate from this.[6] When Kishimoto was creating the primary setting of the Naruto manga, he concentrated initially on the designs for the village of Konoha. The idea of the setting came to him \\"pretty spontaneously without much thought,\\" but admits that the scenery became based on his home in the Japanese prefecture of Okayama prefecture. Since the storyline does not specify when it is set, he was able to include modern elements in the series such as convenience stores.[15] He considered including automobiles, planes and simple computers, but excluded projectile weapons and vehicles from the plot.[15][16]\\r\\nWhen serialization began, Kishimoto decided the ending would feature a fight between two characters: Naruto and Sasuke,[17] which would end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato. Kishimoto chose Hinata Hyuga as Naruto's romantic partner from the early stages of the manga, since Hinata had always respected and admired Naruto even before the series' beginning, and Kishimoto felt this meant the two of them could build a relationship. This decision annoyed his wife because she wanted Naruto to marry Sakura Haruno,[18] but Kishimoto viewed Sakura as Naruto's friend and teammate, rather than a future wife. When Hinata first appeared, Kishimoto thought of forming a love triangle among the three characters, but because he decided that fighting was the main focus of the manga, there was little room for romantic plotlines.[19][20]\\r\\nNaruto was published in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shnen Jump from September 21, 1999 (No. 43), to November 10, 2014 (No. 50).[21] The manga was also published in tankbon (book) form in Japan and other countries, releasing 72 volumes27 for Part I, and the rest for Part II. The first 238 chapters are Part I and constitute the first section of the Naruto storyline. Chapters 239 to 244 include a gaiden (side-story) focusing on Kakashi Hatake's background. The remaining chapters (245 to 700) belong to Part II, which continues the story after a two-and-a-half year gap in the internal timeline.[22] The first tankbon was released on March 3, 2000.[23] Shueisha have also released several ani-manga tankbon, each based on one of the Naruto movies,[24] and has released the series in Japanese for cell-phone download on their website Shueisha Manga Capsule.[25] A miniseries titled Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring (Naruto?ϻ?X???ۜySI񂼿, Naruto Gaiden: Nanadaime Hokage to Akairo no Hanatsuzuki), centered on the main characters' children, began serialization in the Japanese and English editions of Weekly Shnen Jump on April 27, 2015, and ended after ten chapters on July 6, 2015.[26][27]\\r\\nNaruto was scanlated (translated by fans) and available online before a licensed version was released in North America;[28] the rights were acquired by Viz Media, who began serializing Naruto in their anthology comic magazine Shonen Jump, starting with the January 2003 issue.[29] The schedule was accelerated at the end of 2007 to catch up with the Japanese version,[30] and again in early 2009, with 11 volumes (from 34 to 44) appearing in three months, after which it returned to a quarterly schedule.[31] All 27 volumes of Part I were released in a boxed set on November 13, 2007.[32] On May 3, 2011, Viz started selling the manga in an omnibus format with each book containing three volumes.[33]\\r\\nAs of March 31, 2008, the franchise has been licensed in 90 countries, and the manga serialized in 35 countries.[34][35] Carlsen Comics has licensed the series, through its regional divisions, and released the series in German and Danish.[36] The series is also licensed for regional language releases in French and Dutch by Kana,[37] in Polish by Japonica Polonica Fantastica,[38] in Russian by Comix-ART,[39] in Finnish by Sangatsu Manga,[40] in Swedish by Bonnier Carlsen,[41] and Italian by Panini Comics.[42]\\r\\nA spin-off comedy manga by Kenji Taira, titled Rock Lee no Seishun Full-Power Ninden (?μ龰׻ɷ???, Rock Lee & His Ninja Pals) focuses on the character Rock Lee, a character who aspires to be strong as a ninja but has no magical jutsu abilities. It ran in Shueisha's Saiky Jump magazine from December 3, 2010, to July 4, 2014,[43][44] and was made into an anime series, produced by Studio Pierrot, and premiering on TV Tokyo on April 3, 2012.[45] Crunchyroll simulcasted the series' premiere on their website and streamed the following episodes.[46] Taira also wrote Uchiha Sasuke no Sharingan Den (зӵދ???, Sasuke Uchiha's Sharingan Legend), which released on October 3, 2014, which runs in the same magazine and features Sasuke.[47]\\r\\nA monthly sequel series titled Boruto: Naruto Next Generations began in the Japanese and English editions of Weekly Shnen Jump in early 2016, illustrated by Mikio Ikemoto and written by Uky Kodachi, with supervision by Kishimoto. Ikemoto was Kishimoto's chief assistant during the run of the original Naruto series, and Kodachi was his writing partner for the Boruto: Naruto the Movie film screenplay. The monthly series was preceded by a one-shot written and illustrated by Kishimoto.[48]\\r\\nTetsuya Nishio was the character designer for Naruto when the manga was adapted into an anime series; Kishimoto had requested that Nishio be given this role.[49][50] Directed by Hayato Date, and produced by Studio Pierrot and TV Tokyo, the Naruto anime premiered in Japan on TV Tokyo October 3, 2002, and concluded on February 8, 2007 after 220 episodes.[51][52] The first 135 episodes were adapted from Part I of the manga; the remaining 85 episodes are original and use plot elements that are not in the manga.[53] Beginning on April 29, 2009, the original Naruto anime began a rerun on Wednesdays and Thursdays (until the fourth week of September 2009 when it changed to only Wednesdays). It was remastered in HD, with new 2D and 3D effects, under the name Naruto: Shnen Hen (栀, \\"Youth Version\\").[54] Episodes from the series have been released on both VHS and DVD, and collected as boxed sets.[55][56][57][58]\\r\\nViz licensed the anime series for broadcast and distribution in the Region 1 market.[59] The English adaptation of the anime began airing on September 10, 2005 and concluded on January 31, 2009, with 209 episodes aired on Cartoon Network's Toonami in the United States.[60][61] The episodes were also broadcast on SABC 2 (South Africa),[62] YTV's Bionix (Canada)[63] and Jetix's (United Kingdom)[64] programming blocks, and were released on DVD on March 28, 2006.[65] The first 26 volumes contain four episodes; later DVD volumes have five episodes.[66] Uncut editions were released in DVD box sets, each containing 12ÿ15 episodes, with some variation based on story arcs.[67] In the American broadcast, references to alcohol, Japanese culture, sexual innuendo, and the appearance of blood and death were sometimes edited but remained in the DVD editions.[68] Other networks cut more material, for example Jetix censored scenes with blood, strong language, and smoking. The series was also licensed to Hulu, Joost, and Crunchyroll, which aired the episodes online with the original Japanese audio tracks and English subtitles.[69][70][71] On June 1, 2017, it was announced that an HD remaster version of the original Naruto television anime series would debut on Japanese TV on June 24, starting with the show's first episode.[72]\\r\\nNaruto: Shippuden (Naruto -ϻ- ײa??, Naruto Shippden, lit. \\"Naruto: Hurricane Chronicles\\"), developed by Studio Pierrot and directed by Hayato Date, is the sequel to the original Naruto anime; it corresponds to Part II of the manga.[73] It debuted on Japanese TV on February 15, 2007, on TV Tokyo, and concluded on March 23, 2017.[74][75] On January 8, 2009, TV Tokyo began broadcasting new episodes via internet streaming to monthly subscribers. Each streamed episode was available online within an hour of its Japanese release and includes English subtitles.[76] Viz began streaming English subtitled episodes on January 2, 2009, on its series' website, including episodes that had already been released as well as new episodes from Japan.[77] In North America, the English dub of Naruto: Shippuden aired weekly on Disney XD from October 28, 2009, to November 5, 2011.[78] Episodes 98 onward premiered uncut on Neon Alley,[79] and on Toonami in January 5, 2014.[80]\\r\\nThe series was released on Region 2 DVD in Japan with four or five episodes per disk; there are four series of DVD releases divided by story arc.[81] There was a special feature included with the seventh Naruto: Shippuden compilation DVD called Hurricane! \\"Konoha Academy\\" Chronicles.[82] Kakashi Chronicles: Boys' Life on the Battlefield (˂X?f??MTy\`̖X̰רF, Kakashi Gaiden ~Senj no Bizu Raifu~) was released on December 16, 2009; featuring episodes 119ÿ120, the story revolves around Kakashi Hatake's childhood.[83]\\r\\nThe first North American DVD of the series was released on September 29, 2009.[84] Only the first 53 episodes were made available in this format before it ended with the 12th volume on August 10, 2010.[85] Subsequent episodes were released as part of DVD boxed sets, beginning with the first season on January 26, 2010.[86] In the United Kingdom, the series was licensed by Manga Entertainment who released the first DVD collection on June 14, 2010.[87]\\r\\nEleven Naruto original video animations (OVAs) have been released.\\r\\nThe series was adapted into eleven films; the first three correspond to the first anime series, and the remaining eight correspond to the second series. Dates in the list below are for the original Japanese release; all the films were released in English, usually no more than three years later.\\r\\nIn July 2015, Lionsgate announced they were developing a live-action Naruto with Avi Arad through his production company Arad Productions, with Michael Gracey directing, and Erik Feig, Geoff Shaveitz, and Kelly O'Malley producing.[113] On December 17, 2016, Kishimoto announced that he has been asked to help develop the movie.[114]\\r\\nTwenty-six Naruto light novels, the first nine written by Masatoshi Kusakabe, have been published in Japan.[115] Of these, the first two have been released in English in North America. The first adapted novel, Naruto: Innocent Heart, Demonic Blood (2002), retells a Team 7 mission in which they encounter the assassins Zabuza and Haku;[116][117] the second, Naruto: Mission: Protect the Waterfall Village! (2003) was based on the second OVA of the anime.[118][119] Viz has also published 16 chapter books written by Tracey West with illustrations from the manga. Unlike the series, these books were aimed at children ages seven to ten.[120]\\r\\nThirteen original novels have appeared in Japan;[115] eleven of these are part of a series, and the other two are independent novels unconnected to the series. The first independent novel, titled Naruto: Tales of a Gutsy Ninja (2009), is presented as an in-universe novel written by Naruto's master Jiraiya. It follows the adventures of a fictional shinobi named Naruto Musasabi, who served as Naruto's namesake.[121] The other independent novel, Naruto Jinraiden: The Day the Wolf Howled (2012), is set shortly after Sasuke's fight with Itachi.[122]\\r\\nItachi Shinden, which consists of two novels, and Sasuke Shinden, a single novel, both appeared in 2015, and both were adapted into anime arcs in Naruto: Shippuden in 2016, titled Naruto Shippden: Itachi Shinden-hen: Hikari to Yami and Book of Sunrise respectively.[123][124] Hiden is a series of six light novels published in 2015 that explores the stories of various characters after the ending of the manga.[125]\\r\\nToshio Masuda composed and arranged the Naruto soundtracks. Naruto Original Soundtrack was released on April 3, 2003, and contains 22 tracks used during the first season of the anime.[126] This was followed by Naruto Original Soundtrack II, released on March 18, 2004, which includes 19 tracks.[127] The third, Naruto Original Soundtrack III, was released on April 27, 2005, with 23 tracks.[128] Two soundtracks containing all the opening and ending themes of the series, titled Naruto: Best Hit Collection and Naruto: Best Hit Collection II were released on November 17, 2004, and August 2, 2006.[129][130] Eight tracks from the series were selected and released on a CD called Naruto in Rock -The Very Best Hit Collection Instrumental Version- released on December 19, 2007.[131] Soundtracks for the three movies based on the first anime series were available for sale near their release dates.[132][133][134] On October 12, 2011, a CD collecting the themes from Naruto Shnen Hen was released.[135] Various CD series were released with voice actors performing original episodes.[136]\\r\\nThe soundtracks of Naruto: Shippuden were produced by Yasuharu Takanashi; they were titled Naruto Shippden Original Soundtrack I, II, and III, and were released in 2007, 2009, and 2016.[137][138][139] Naruto All Stars, released in 2008, consists of 10 original Naruto songs remixed and sung by characters from the series.[140] Ten themes from the two anime series were collected in the DVD box Naruto Super Hits 2006ÿ2008, which appeared in 2008.[141] Soundtracks from the Shippuden films have also been released, with the first one available in 2007.[142][143] A final one composed of the series is set to be released in late 2017 with Aniplex having started a survey of all Naruto and Naruto Shippuden themes to be included in the CD.[144]\\r\\nNaruto video games have been released on various consoles by Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft. Most of them are fighting games in which the player directly controls one of the characters from Naruto. The player pits their character against another character controlled by the game's AI or by another player; the object is to reduce the opponent's health to zero using basic attacks as well as special techniques unique to each character derived from techniques they use in the Naruto anime or manga.[145] The first Naruto video game was Naruto: Konoha Ninpch, which was released in Japan on March 27, 2003, for the WonderSwan Color.[146] Most Naruto video games have been released only in Japan. The first games released outside of Japan were the Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen series and the Naruto: Saikyou Ninja Daikesshu series, released in North America under the titles of Naruto: Clash of Ninja and Naruto: Ninja Council.[147][148] In January 2012, Namco Bandai announced they had sold 10 million Naruto games worldwide.[149]\\r\\nThree official artbooks based on the Naruto series have been released. The first two, titled Art Collection: Uzumaki, and Illustration Collection: Naruto, were released in Japan in 2004 and 2009, with North American editions following in 2007 and 2010 respectively.[150][151][152][153] The third artbook Illustration Collection: Naruto Uzumaki, was published in 2015 in Japan and later the same year in North America;[154][155] it contains artwork originally on Shonen Jump comic covers. It has no text except a brief commentary by Kishimoto about his favorite artworks.[156] An interactive coloring book called Paint Jump: Art of Naruto was released in 2008.[157] An unreleased artbook titled Naruto Exhibition Official Guest Book by Masashi Kishimoto was given to those who attended the Naruto art exhibition at the Mori Art Museum on April 25, 2015.[158]\\r\\nFour guidebooks titled First Official Data Book through Fourth Official Data Book have been released; the first two cover Part I of the manga, and were released in 2002 and 2005; the third and fourth volumes appeared in 2008 and 2014[159][160][161] These books contain character profiles, Jutsu guides, and drafts by Kishimoto.[162] For the anime, a series of guidebooks called Naruto Anime Profiles was released. These books contain information about the production of the anime episodes and explanations of the characters' designs.[163] A manga fan book titled Secret: Writings from the Warriors Official Fanbook appeared in 2002,[164] and another fan book was released to commemorate the series' 10th anniversary, including illustrations of Naruto Uzumaki by other manga artists, a novel, Kishimoto's one-shot titled Karakuri, and an interview between Kishimoto and Yoshihiro Togashi.[165]\\r\\nProduced by Bandai, the Naruto Collectible Card Game was released in Japan in 2003,[166] and in North America in 2006.[167] The game is played between two players using a customized deck of fifty cards from the set, and a game mat. To win, a player must either earn ten \\"battle rewards\\" through their actions in the game or cause the other player to exhaust their deck.[168] The cards were released in named sets called \\"series,\\" in the form of four 50-card pre-constructed box sets.[166][167] Each set includes a starter deck, the game mat, a turn-counter, and one stainless steel \\"Ninja Blade Coin.\\" Extra cards are available in 10-card booster packs, and deck sets. Four box sets sold in retailers are available for each series. Cards for each set are available in collectible tins, containing several booster packs and exclusive promotional cards in a metal box.[169] By October 2006, seventeen series had been released in Japan with 417 unique cards.[166] As of August 2008, ten of these series had been released in North America.[170]\\r\\nThe manga has sold more than 220 million copies worldwide, making it the third best-selling manga series in history.[171] More than half of the sales were in Japan, with the remaining sales from 35 other countries.[35] It has become one of North American publisher Viz Media's best-selling manga series;[172] their translation of the series appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller lists several times, and volume seven of the manga won the Quill Award for graphic novel in 2006.[173][174] It was included in the fiction section of Teacher Librarian's recommended list for 2008,[175] and School Library Journal described it as an essential manga for school libraries.[176] Volume 28 of the manga reached 17th place in the USA Today Booklist in its first week of release in March 2008, only two places short of the record for a manga, held by Fruits Basket.[177] The volume had one of the biggest debut weeks of any manga in years, becoming the top-selling manga volume of 2008 and the second best-selling book in North America.[178][179] In 2010, Viz, the publisher, commented on the loyalty of readers, who reliably continued to buy the manga as the volume count went over 40.[180]\\r\\nIn April 2007, volume 14 earned Viz the Manga Trade Paperback of the Year Gem Award from Diamond Comic Distributors.[181] The manga was nominated for Favorite Manga Series in Nickelodeon Magazine's 2009 Comics Awards.[182] In February 2015, Asahi Shimbun announced that Naruto was one of nine nominees for the nineteenth annual Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize,[183] and the following month Kishimoto was the winner of Rookie of the Year for the series in the Japanese government's Agency for Cultural Affairs 2014 Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology Fine Arts Recommendation Awards.[184] Responding to Naruto's success, Kishimoto said in Naruto Collector Winter 2007/2008 that he was \\"very glad that the American audience has accepted and understood ninja. It shows that the American audience has good taste?[...] because it means they can accept something previously unfamiliar to them.\\"[185]\\r\\nNaruto Shippuden has been ranked several times as one of the most watched series in Japan.[186][187] The first DVD compilation released by Viz received a nomination from the American Anime Awards for best package design.[188]\\r\\nSeveral reviewers commented on the balance between fight scenes and plot development; A. E. Sparrow of IGN and Casey Brienza of Anime News Network (ANN) felt that the result was a strong storyline,[189][190] but Carl Kimlinger, also writing for ANN, suggested that there were too many fights, which slowed down the plot.[191] Kimlinger liked the character designs, and approved of the fight scenes themselves[191] which also drew positive comments from Rik Spanjers, who felt that the excitement of the scenes depends on Kishimoto's skill in depicting action.[191] Javier Lugo, writing for Manga Life, agreed, describing the artwork as \\"dramatic, exciting, and just right for the story he's telling\\".[192]\\r\\nThe anime and manga magazine Neo described Naruto's character as \\"irksome\\", but considered that the series' \\"almost sickening addictiveness\\" was due to the quality of the characterization,[193] and in Briana Lawrence's opinion the growth of the characters gave Part II an adult feel.[194] In a review of volume 28 Brienza also praised Part II's storyline and characterization, though she commented that not every volume reached a high level of quality.[189]\\r\\nG It, a professor in the manga department of Tokyo Polytechnic University, compared the series' development to the manga of Dragon Ball, saying that both manga present good illustrations of three-dimensional body movements that capture the characters' martial arts very well. G felt readers could empathize with the characters in Naruto via their inner monologue during battles.[195]\\r\\nThe series also influenced the movie Scott Pilgrim vs. The World with director Edgar Wright saying he was inspired by how whenever there is a \\"killer move\\" in the manga, there is an impact in the background following any technique's usage.[196] There is an internet meme known as \\"Naruto run\\" based on the way the characters run leaning forward with their arms behind their backs. In September 2017, students from the University of the Philippines Los Ba?os Perspective started covering publications of students running like Naruto characters.[197] Naruto has also served as an inspiration for several other manga, including My Hero Academia[198] and Black Clover.[199] When the manga ended, multiple authors from the magazine expressed congratulations to Kishimoto's work.[200]\\r\\nThe Naruto anime was listed as the 38th best animated show in IGN's Top 100 Animated Series.[201] Mike Hale of The New York Times described the series as much better than American animation aimed at children,[202] but the animation received some criticism from both the T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews critics: Christina Carpenter felt Kishimoto's artistic style translated poorly into animation,[203] and Derrick Tucker was also negative, though he felt that at their best, the depictions \\"[left] little to be desired\\".[204] As with the manga, some reviewers, such as Martin Theron of ANN, along with Tucker, felt there were too many fight scenes,[204][205] though Justin Rich argued that the fight scenes were the most important and enjoyable element of the show.[206] Carpenter also commented positively on the characters, though she felt that most were fairly stereotypical.[203]\\r\\nNaruto: Shippuden was well-reviewed by Activeanime's David C. Jones who commented that the animation had improved.[207] ANN noted that the series has a more serious tone and a better balance between comedy and drama than the first anime series; with more interesting digressions from the main plot.[208][209] Although the pacing for the first episodes was criticised as slow, the delivery and development of the interactions between the characters received positive comments.[210][211] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Charles Solomon ranked Shippuden the third best anime on his \\"Top 10\\".[212] In September 2005, Japanese television network TV Asahi broadcast a popularity poll based on a nationwide survey in which Naruto placed 17th.[213]\\r\\nAmy Plumb argues that Kishimoto's use of references to Japanese mythology in Naruto are intended to add further layers to the story. Kishimoto expects his readers to decode the references, which allows him to avoid direct explanations. One example is Itachi, who has three ninja techniques named after Shinto deities: Tsukiyomi, Amaterasu, and Susano-o. Plumb also cites Sasuke's clan's heraldic symbol, a fan known as an uchiwa. These fans are used in Japanese myths to exorcise evil, by blowing it away; Sasuke discovers late in the series that he has the ability to \\"blow away\\" the influence of the Nine-Tailed Fox on Naruto. Foxes (kitsune tsuki) are tricksters in Japanese mythology, and in some stories they take over human bodies; Plumb comments on the obvious similarities to the Nine-Tail sealed in Naruto, and the pranks Naruto plays.[214]\\r\\nChristopher A. Born notes that the Naruto storyline contains traditional Confucian values, and suggests that students who analyse manga such as Naruto and Bleach will learn more about Confucianism than they would from studying its abstract ideas.[215] Norman Melchor Robles Jr. evaluated the portrayal of both positive and negative ideas in Naruto by counting words in the script which were associated with either violence or positive values; he found that a small majority of tagged words were violent, but commented that the portrayal of violence seemed organized to show how positive strategies on the part of the protagonists could overcome the violence.[216] Sheuo Hui Gan considers the series to have a set of \\"traditional ethical values.\\" She also compares the treatment of alienation in Naruto, which Naruto overcomes by joining his society, to the portrayal of alienation in Akira and Neon Genesis Evangelion, where the main characters remain alienated.[217]\\r\\nNaruto has been described by several critics as a coming-of-age story.[218][219][220] Psychologist Lawrence C. Rubin suggests that the storylines would appeal to readers of any age who have lost loved ones, or are having difficulty finding friends, or who are in other situations shown in the series.[218] In Yukari Fujimoto's view, as the characters mature, they show respect to the adults who have raised and taught them, making it a conservative storyline in comparison to other manga of the same time period such as One Piece and Air Gear.[219] Rik Spanjers sees the difference between Sasuke (a loner) and Naruto (an optimist) as tragic, arguing that the contrast between the two protagonists' approach to the world is fundamental to the plot: \\"Narutos strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect, while Sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge\\".[220] Omote Tomoyuki points out that there are many comic moments in the story despite the difficulties Naruto finds himself in, but the comic elements diminish dramatically over time as Naruto grows into a teenager, particularly once Part II begins. Shnen Jump began to carry comedies such as Gintama and Reborn! from 2003 onwards, and in Tomoyuki's view this is part of the reason for the change in emphasis: Naruto \\"was not supposed to provide laughter anymore\\".[221]\\r\\nFujimoto argues that the story has overly traditional gender roles, noting \\"[...] its representations suggest that men are men and women are women and that they differ naturally regarding aptitude and vocation\\". For example, the girls initially outperform the boys in the Ninja Academy, but \\"once the boys get serious, the girls cannot keep pace\\". Fujimoto points out that this does not upset Sakura, who is now surpassed by Naruto. Character development based on female roles, when it does occur, again uses stereotypical roles: Tsunade, for example, a middle-aged woman with large breasts, is a clear mother figure, and when she teaches Sakura to be a medical ninja, which requires special skills possessed only by women, the story reinforces the idea that women only belong on the battlefield as healers. Tsunade herself, who is a figure of authority in Naruto, is portrayed as ridiculous in a way that men in the same position are not. Fujimoto suggests this presentation of women may explain why the female characters are often the most disliked characters among readers of the manga.[222]\\r\\nFormer:","input":"When did naruto first air on cartoon network?"},{"output":"Bluetick Coonhound","context":"Smokey is the mascot of the University of Tennessee sports teams. These teams, named \\"The Volunteers\\" and nicknamed \\"the Vols\\", use both a live and a costumed version of Smokey.\\r\\nThere is an actual Bluetick Coonhound mascot, Smokey X, who leads the Vols on the field for football games. The Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity cares for the hound on the University of Tennessee campus. There is also a costumed mascot that appears at every Vols game and has won several mascot championships.\\r\\nIn 1953, the University of Tennessee Pep Club held a contest to select a coonhound, a breed native to Tennessee, to serve as the school's live mascot. Announcements of the contest in local newspapers read, \\"This can't be an ordinary hound. He must be a 'Houn' Dog' in the best sense of the word.\\"[1]\\r\\nThe late Rev. W. C. \\"Bill\\" Brooks entered his prize-winning bluetick coonhound, \\"Brooks' Blue Smokey\\", in the school's contest. At halftime of the Mississippi State game that season, several dogs were lined up on the old cheerleaders' ramp at ShieldsÿWatkins Field for voting. Each dog was introduced over the loudspeaker, and the student body cheered for their favorite. \\"Blue Smokey\\" was the last hound introduced. When his name was called, he barked. The students cheered and Smokey threw his head back and howled again. This kept going until the stadium was in an uproar, and the University had found its mascot. \\"Blue Smokey\\" would compile a 10-10-1 record during his two seasons as Vols mascot. Tennessee's first mascot met a sudden and tragic end in 1955, as he was fatally struck by a car after escaping from his home.\\r\\nSmokey II (\\"PR Brooks Blue Smokey II\\") took over for his father as the Vols' mascot when he was only 3 months old. In 1955, students from the University of Kentucky kidnapped him for eight days, dressing him in a blue and white blanket with a large K and parading him around at a Wildcats pep rally. Smokey's captors returned him just before kickoff. A week later, three Vanderbilt students tried the same heist at the Brooks house, but ended up taking an old hunting dog instead.[2] Smokey II was also involved in an incident with the Baylor Bears' live bear mascot Judge at the 1957 Sugar Bowl, with the bear taking a few swats at the hound. In 1963, Smokey died in Lexington shortly after the Vols' game against Kentucky, reportedly because someone fed him a chocolate pie.[3]\\r\\nSmokey III (\\"PR Brooks Blue Smokey III\\") assumed the role of Tennessee mascot on June 18, 1964.[4] He compiled a 105-39-5 record, attended ten bowl games, and presided over two SEC championships during his tenure.[5]\\r\\nSmokey IV (\\"PR Blue Smokey Joe\\") became mascot on September 24, 1973. He compiled a 12-10-1 record with the Vols, but sadly, he died of cancer on December 4, 1979.[6] Smokey IV never produced offspring before his death, and thus the bloodline was broken.\\r\\nSmokey V (\\"PR Blue Smokey V\\") was the nephew of Smokey IV. He assumed the role of mascot on June 1, 1980 when he was just 12-weeks-old, and he would then outgrow five jackets in one season. Sadly, his reign would come to an end when he was hit by a car.\\r\\nSmokey VI served as mascot and presided over three SEC championships for Tennessee. His owner, the Rev. Bill Brooks, died during Smokey VI's tenure on September 17, 1986 at the age of 81. Brooks' wife, Mildred, then took over in caring for Smokey.[7] During the 1991 UCLA game, Smokey suffered heat exhaustion in the 100+ degree temperatures and was listed on the Vols injury report until he returned later in the season. A kennel mate named \\"Woody\\" took over for him while he recovered. Smokey VI died in late 1991 of brain cancer at 10 years old.[8]\\r\\nSmokey VII roamed the sidelines for Tennessee from 1992 to 1994. He was forced into early retirement after he nipped at the same UT band member in consecutive games in 1994.[9]\\r\\nSmokey VIII was the most successful of the live dogs, presiding as mascot as the Vols compiled a record of 91-22, claimed two SEC titles, and won a national championship in 1998.[5] Born on November 10, 1994, Smokey VIII began his reign in 1995 and retired after the 2004 Peach Bowl in Atlanta after being diagnosed with a nasal tumor in December 2003.[10] He underwent radiation treatment and then chemotherapy. The expected prognosis, with treatment was 13 months. Smokey VIII more than doubled that at two years, four months.[11] \\"He served with distinction, weathered storms, cold and heat\\", recalled Earl Hudson, who owned the dog since it was two months old. \\"He came through it all real well and was always rearing to go. He was a great mascot.\\"[12] Smokey VIII died on March 17, 2006 after suffering complications from high blood pressure and kidney disease.[12]\\r\\nSmokey IX began his post at the 2004 Peach Bowl and was retired in 2012.[13] This dog was known to be somewhat feisty. In 2006 he bit an Alabama player during pregame warm-ups. An ESPN article said a Crimson Tide receiver fell on the dog when the player jumped out of bounds for a pass. The athlete-dog interaction caused a dust-up among the rivals. Alabama said Smokey bit the player but UT say Smokey only nipped, getting a little of the receiver's uniform but not breaking the man's skin.[13] He also took a nip at one of UT's own: running on the field after halftime of the Vols' game against Georgia State, he nipped backup long snapper Matt Giampapa on the hip. Giampapa wasn't hurt, and it was thought that Smokey may have seen a towel Giampapa had and mistaken for a towel his handlers use as a dog toy.[13]\\r\\nSmokey X, the current Smokey mascot, made his debut in 2013. During the week, he lives with the Hudson family. He is the first Smokey not descended from the original Smokey bloodline, but he is the first from a new Tennessee-born and bred bloodline.[14] On game days and while attending to official mascot duties, Smokey is handled by members of UT's Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity. For home games, he usually spends the weekend in the fraternity house on UT's campus.\\r\\nThe live hound mascot has been featured in television news segments.[5] Additionally, in 2012, the University of Tennessee Press published a book about Smokey's history, written by Tennessee sports historian Tom Mattingly and Smokey's owner, Earl Hudson (the brother-in-law of Rev. Brooks, the original owner of Smokey).[15][16]\\r\\nThe costumed version of Smokey made his debut in the 1980s. Until the late 1980s, this costume was designed as a cartoon-like orange and white dog. This version of Smokey would often drink orange juice out of a bottle to cool down, mostly because of the color of the drink.\\r\\nTennessee attempted to create a more realistic looking hound costume in 1982, but the end result was panned by the students and this iteration of Smokey was quickly retired. The orange Smokey reigned until 1988, when the University tried once more to redesign Smokey. Smokey's new, more realistic look initially garnered mixed reactions from the Volunteer fanbase, but the redesign quickly became a fan favorite and remains the face of Tennessee athletics to this day. The costumed Smokey's body is black, leading to occasional misidentification as the more familiar Black and Tan Coonhound. However, his white blaze firmly identifies him as a Bluetick Coonhound.[17] He typically wears a Tennessee jersey bearing the number \\"00\\".\\r\\nIn 2006, Smokey made it to the quarterfinals of the Capital One Mascot Challenge, also making several appearances in Capital One commercials.[5] He is a perennial favorite when he competes in national mascot competitions, and he was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2008.[18]\\r\\nSmokey is occasionally joined by a female counterpart that appears at the women's athletic events.[5] He is joined at most events by his six-year-old little brother, Junior Smokey, who serves as the \\"kiddie\\" mascot. Junior typically wears a jersey with the number \\"1/2\\" on it. In 2015, Junior Smokey was named \\"Mascot of the Year\\" at the World Dog Awards in Los Angeles.[19]","input":"What kind of dog is the tennessee volunteers mascot?"},{"output":"Basketball Australia","context":"Basketball is a sport played both indoors and outdoors in Australia. Basketball is the number two sport globally with 213 countries participating in basketball internationally and with over 450 million players regularly playing the game. According to research conducted by Sweeney Sports, one in three Australians have an interest in basketball. Furthermore, basketball is played by approximately one million men and women, boys and girls throughout Australia. According to Basketball Australia, as of March 2014, basketball is the second highest team participation sport in Australia.[1]\\r\\nBasketball in Australia experienced a golden age in the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s, during which the National Basketball League saw it halcyon days. Back then, kids in singlets roamed basketball courts around Australia trying to emulate guys like Andrew Gaze, Scott Fisher, Bruce Bolden or Leroy Loggins. However, its popularity, media attention, attendance and corporate support deteriorated during the 2000s. Despite this, figures released by the Australian Sports Commission's Exercise, Recreation and Sport Survey in 2010 showed that basketball was the most popular sport played in the state of Victoria.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first press reference to a game of basketball in Australia is from The Adelaide Advertiser ÿ Mail Steamers section, on Wednesday 17 February 1897 reporting that the following Tuesday at the opening of Our Boys Institute, claimed to be the largest gymnasium in the colonies, OBI would play YMCA in the first exhibition of basketball in South Australia. There is no evidence of any game being played earlier elsewhere thus the first game of basketball was played in Australia on Tuesday 23 February 1897. This occurred only 6 years after the invention of the sport on 21 December 1891 by Canadian Dr. James Naismith, a physical education professor and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (YMCA) - today, Springfield College in Springfield, Massachusetts. OBI and the YMCA continued to be at the forefront of the development early Adelaide basketball and now, more than 120 years later, basketball is one of the most popular participation sports in the country.\\r\\nThe National Basketball League (NBL) is the top-level men's basketball competition in Australia, which began in 1979. As a result, the sport experienced rapid growth in the 1980s with the influx of exciting American imports. Capitalising on growing interest in the sport, the national competition became a huge hit in the major cities. By the late 1990s however, basketball in Australia went into sharp decline. According to three-time Adelaide 36ers championship coach Phil Smyth, Australian basketball administrators rested on their laurels during the 1990s when the sport was a major part of the national landscape. \\"They let the brand get damaged,\\" Smyth said. \\"It's that old saying 'if you keep doing the same thing over and over again hoping for a different result, you're a fool  and basketball was foolish.\\"[4] During the 2000s, interest in the NBL slowly began to dwindle, with many teams being forced to fold, arenas saw fluctuated attendances, and the league's presence on TV was inconsistent.[4]\\r\\nIn 2015, a record number of Australians playing in the NBA led to a renewed popularity in the sport and showed Australians still loved basketball but were unsure about the national product.[4]\\r\\nThe Boomers are the men's basketball team which represents Australia in international competitions. As of 2016, the Boomers have won 19 FIBA Oceania Championships and one Commonwealth Games Gold Medal in 2006. They have never placed at the Olympic Games or World Cup; their best finish being 4th place at the Olympics in 1988, 1996, 2000 and 2016, and 5th at the 1982 and 1994 World Cups.\\r\\nThe women's national team is the Opals. They have won Olympic silver in 2000, 2004 and 2008, Olympic bronze in 1996 and 2012, as well as gold at the 2006 FIBA World Championship and bronze at the 1998, 2002 and 2014 World Cups.","input":"Who is the governing body for australian basketball?"},{"output":"Electronic Arts","context":"EA Sports is a division of Electronic Arts that develops and publishes sports video games. Formerly a marketing gimmick of Electronic Arts, in which they tried to imitate real-life sports networks by calling themselves the \\"EA Sports Network\\" (EASN) with pictures or endorsements with real commentators such as John Madden, it soon grew up to become a sub-label on its own, releasing game series such as NBA Live, FIFA, NHL, Madden NFL, and NASCAR.\\r\\nMost games under this brand are developed by EA Canada, the studio of Electronic Arts in Burnaby, British Columbia, as well as EA Blackbox, Vancouver, British Columbia and EA Tiburon in Maitland, Florida. The main rival to EA Sports is 2K Sports. Notably, both companies compete over the realm of NBA games. Konami is its rival in association football games.\\r\\nEA Sports inherits its motto \\"It's in the game\\" from the parent company, Electronic Arts. It was voiced by journalist Andrew Anthony.\\r\\nUnlike some other sports game companies, EA Sports has no special ties to a single platform, which means that all games are released for the best-selling active platforms, sometimes long after most of the other companies abandon them. For example, FIFA 98, Madden NFL 98, NBA Live 98, and NHL 98 were released for the Sega Genesis and the Super NES throughout 1997; Madden NFL 2005 and FIFA 2005 had PlayStation released in 2004 (FIFA 2005 was also the last PlayStation title to be released); and NCAA Football 08 had an Xbox released in 2007. Madden NFL 08 also had Xbox and Nintendo GameCube releases in 2007, and was the final title released for the GameCube, with Madden NFL 09 following as the final Xbox title.

On February 12, 2008, EA Sports announced the extension of its exclusive deal until the 2012 NFL season.\\r\\nLess than a month after the NFL Exclusive deal, EA Sports signed a four-year exclusive deal with the Arena Football League (AFL).\\r\\nOn April 11, 2005, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and EA Sports signed a deal to grant EA Sports the sole rights to produce college football games for six years.\\r\\nEA lost the rights for Major League Baseball (MLB) games to 2K Sports in 2005, ending EA's MVP series; however, EA made NCAA Baseball games in 2006 and 2007 after losing the MLB license.\\r\\nIn January 2008, EA Sports decided not to renew their NCAA College Baseball license while they evaluate the status of their MVP game engine.\\r\\nIn 2005, EA Sports and ESPN signed a massive 15-year deal for ESPN to be integrated into EA Sports video games from 2K Sports and Sega. EA's use of the ESPN license has steadily increased over the early life of the deal. EA's early usage of the ESPN license began with ESPN Radio and a sports ticker in titles like Madden NFL, NBA Live, Tiger Woods PGA Tour, and NCAA Baseball and Football. The ESPN integration now includes streaming podcasts, text articles (including content only available previously to ESPN Insider subscribers), and ESPN Motion video (including such programs as Pardon the Interruption).\\r\\nIn 2012, EA signs a \\"multi-year, multi-product\\" partnership with the Ultimate Fighting Championship, taking over from THQ.\\r\\nIn June 2009, EA Sports announced that for 2010, the games Madden NFL, NCAA Football, NASCAR, NHL, NBA Live, and Tiger Woods PGA Tour would not be shipped for PC platforms.[1] The NCAA Football series had not been released on the PC since 1998, The Tiger Woods series' last PC game was Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08, the NASCAR series had not had a PC version since NASCAR SimRacing in 2005, and the Madden series' last PC game was Madden NFL 08. The NHL series' last PC game was NHL 09. Likewise, NBA Live 08 was the final PC version for NBA Live.\\r\\nThe head of EA Sports at that time, Peter Moore, cited piracy and the fact that the \\"PC as a platform for authentic, fully-licensed, simulation sports games has declined radically in the past three years as the next generation consoles [...] have attracted millions of consumers.\\"\\r\\nEA Sports released FIFA World as a free-to-play massively multi-player game which is exclusive to the PC on the 12th November 2013.\\r\\nThe company noted that the FIFA and FIFA Manager series would still be released for the PC platform.\\r\\nOn April 23, 2009, EA Sports released the long-awaited \\"EA Sports Complex\\" space for the PlayStation 3's online community-based service, PlayStation Home in the European and North American versions.[2] In the Complex, users can play a series of mini-games, including poker, kart racing, golf, and it also features a Virtual EA Shop. There are also a number of advertisements for upcoming EA Sports games. Each mini-game that the Complex features has a reward or rewards. Heavy Water, a company dedicated to developing for Home, developed the EA Sports Complex for EA Sports.\\r\\nOriginally, the Complex just featured two rooms: the EA Sports Complex and the EA Sports Complex Upstairs. The EA Sports Complex featured racing and had a golfing range that was unavailable to play. The Upstairs had four poker tables that users could play at any time. With the June 18, 2009 update, the Complex's name changed to the EA Sports Racing Complex and the Upstairs changed to the EA Sports Complex Green Poker Room.[3] Other than the name change, the update took away the golfing range and added four more karts for users to play Racing at and it also added one red poker table to the poker room.\\r\\nThe July 2, 2009 update added golf and another poker room making four rooms for the Complex; the EA Sports Racing Complex, the EA Sports Golf Complex, the EA Sports Complex Green Poker Room, and the EA Sports Complex Red Poker Room. The Racing Complex features Racing with a total of eight karts; four on each side of the Complex. The Golf Complex features two Practice Ranges for golfing; one range on each side of the Complex. A Golf Pro-shop is coming soon for the Golf Complex. The Green Poker Room featured four green poker tables that users can play anytime. The Red Poker Room featured four red poker tables but requires users to have 2,000 points to play.\\r\\nOn July 16, 2009, EA Sports released another room for the Complex making five rooms for the Complex. This room is the game space for Fight Night Round 4 called \\"Club Fight Night\\" featuring a mini-game called Club DJ and coming soon, robot boxing.[4]\\r\\nOn July 30, 2009, EA Sports added a Black Poker Table to the EA Sports Complex Red Poker Room for the higher level players. In time, there will be a room dedicated for this table just like the Green Poker Room and the Red Poker Room. They also added a fifth green table to the Green Poker Room. The update also included the addition of the EA Sports Pro Shop where users can purchase full boxing outfits and furniture from Fight Night Round 4. The Pro Shop is found in the Racing Complex. The August 16, 2009 update replaced the fifth green table in the Green Poker Room with a red table. They also reduced the amount of points for the Black Table from 20,000 to 10,000. The August 27, 2009 update separated the scoreboards for each level of play - Green, Red, and Black - and into Daily boards and Season boards (left side and right side), improved card readability, additional rail seating near the poker tables, player removal on lock-up while playing poker, and player buy-in refund on removal (does not refund on Home disconnect) while playing poker.\\r\\nOn October 9, 2009, EA Sports released the EA Sports Complex to the Japanese version of Home. They also released NFL jerseys for every team in the league for purchase inside of the EA Sports Complex and in Home's shopping complex. EA Sports have also teamed up with the Home team to produce and distribute exclusive virtual items that serve to support National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 100% of proceeds for these items went go to the Brees Dream Foundation in support of breast cancer research and awareness programs. The items are black jerseys with a pink number 9 on the front and the name Brees on the back also in pink. These jerseys were available from October 15, 2009 to November 25, 2009.[5] On November 5, 2009, for those who purchased the Brees Breast Cancer jersey, they received a free DJ kit that is featured in the Club Fight Night space by entering one of the two EA Sports Complex poker rooms between November 5, 2009 and November 25, 2009. On November 25, 2009, Fight Night Round 4 producers Mike Mahar and Brian Hayes were in Home between the hours of 4:00pm and 5:00pm PT (7:00pm and 8:00pm EST), for a live chat with the PlayStation Home community in one instance of the Club Fight Night space.[6] On January 7, 2010, EA Sports released NCAA college football jerseys in the EA Sports Complex and in Home's shopping complex.[7]\\r\\nOn August 2, 2011, EA Sports launched the EA Sports Season Ticket subscription service. It was discontinued in 2015 and it was replaced with the similar EA Access service.[citation needed]","input":"What does the ea sports logo stand for?"},{"output":"Uruguay","context":"The 1930 FIFA World Cup was the inaugural FIFA World Cup, the world championship for men's national association football teams. It took place in Uruguay from 13 to 30 July 1930. FIFA, football's international governing body, selected Uruguay as host nation, as the country would be celebrating the centenary of its first constitution, and the Uruguay national football team had successfully retained their football title at the 1928 Summer Olympics. All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, the majority at the Estadio Centenario, which was built for the tournament.\\r\\nThirteen teams (seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America) entered the tournament. Only a few European teams chose to participate because of the difficulty of travelling to South America. The teams were divided into four groups, with the winner of each group progressing to the semi-finals. The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by France and the United States, who defeated Mexico 4ÿ1 and Belgium 3ÿ0, respectively. Lucien Laurent of France scored the first goal in World Cup history, while US goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas posted the first official \\"clean sheet\\" in the tournament.\\r\\nArgentina, Uruguay, the United States and Yugoslavia each won their respective groups to qualify for the semi-finals. In the final, hosts and pre-tournament favourites Uruguay defeated Argentina 4ÿ2 in front of a crowd of 68,346?people, and became the first nation to win the World Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, Hungary and Uruguay all lodged applications to host the event.[1][2] Uruguay's bid became the clear selection after all the other countries withdrew their bids.\\r\\nThe first World Cup was the only one without qualification. Every country affiliated with FIFA was invited to compete, and given a deadline of 28 February 1930 to accept. Plenty of interest was shown by nations in the Americas; Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and the United States all entered. A total of seven South American teams participated, more than in any subsequent World Cup Finals. However, because of the long and costly trip by ship across the Atlantic Ocean, and the length of absence required for players,[1] very few European teams were inclined to take part. Some refused to countenance travel to South America in any circumstances,[3] and no European entries were received before the February deadline. In an attempt to gain some European participation, the Uruguayan Football Association sent a letter of invitation to The Football Association, even though the British Home Nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) had resigned from FIFA at the time. This was rejected by the FA Committee on 18 November 1929.[4] Two months before the start of the tournament, no team from Europe had officially entered.[5] FIFA president Jules Rimet intervened, and eventually four European teams made the trip by sea: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Romanians, managed by Constantin R?dulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following the intervention of newly crowned King Carol?II. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers to ensure that the players would still have jobs upon their return.[6] The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could be persuaded to make the trip.[7] The Belgians participated at the instigation of German-Belgian FIFA vice-president Rodolphe Seeldrayers.[8]\\r\\nLucien Laurent[9]\\r\\nThe Romanians boarded the SS Conte Verde at Genoa, the French were picked up at Villefranche-sur-Mer on 21 June 1930;[10] and the Belgians embarked at Barcelona.[11] The Conte Verde carried Rimet, the trophy and the three designated European referees: the Belgians Jean Langenus and Henri Christophe, along with Thomas Balway, a Parisian who may have been English. The Brazilian team were picked up when the boat docked in Rio de Janeiro on 29 June before arriving in Uruguay on 4 July.[5] Yugoslavia travelled via the mail steamship Florida from Marseille.[11]\\r\\nIn the Kingdom of Yugoslavia there were doubts about their participation at first. Since the Croatians decided to boycott the national team, King Alexander I did not want to finance the whole idea, but in the end they found a solution. Belgrade football association officials decided to round up only domestic (Serbian) star players, mainly from two rival Belgrade clubs, BSK and SK Jugoslavija, with an additional three Serbs who played for French clubs (Ivan Bek among them). Therefore, the Yugoslavia team was exclusively made up of Serbian players; and with the two biggest stars of the team, Blagoje Marjanovi? (\\"Mo?a\\") and Aleksandar Tirnani? (\\"Tirke\\"), both from BSK, they were ready for a trip to South America to represent Yugoslavia in the World Cup. The Yugoslavians were the youngest team in the World Cup; with an average age of 21 years and 258 days. After their first match, against Brazil, they received a new nickname \\"The Ich-es\\" or \\"Ichachos\\" (in Spanish) by the Uruguayan press; referring to most of the player's surnames that ended up with the \\"-i?\\" or \\"-vi?\\" suffix, which is quite common for Serbian last names. They achieved the jointÿbiggest success in both Yugoslav and Serbian subsequent World Cup footballing history, by earning fourth place.[12]\\r\\nAll matches took place in Montevideo. Three stadiums were used: Estadio Centenario, Estadio Pocitos, and Estadio Parque Central. The Estadio Centenario was built both for the tournament and as a celebration of the centenary of Uruguayan independence. Designed by Juan Scasso,[13] it was the primary stadium for the tournament, referred to by Rimet as a \\"temple of football\\".[14] With a capacity of 90,000, it was the largest football stadium outside the British Isles.[8] The stadium hosted 10 of the 18?matches, including both semi-finals and the final. However, a rushed construction schedule and delays caused by the rainy season meant the Centenario was not ready for use until five days into the tournament.[15] Early matches were played at smaller stadiums usually used by Montevideo football clubs Nacional and Pe?arol, the 20,000 capacity Parque Central and the Pocitos.\\r\\nFor a list of all squads that appeared in the final tournament, see 1930 FIFA World Cup squads.\\r\\nFifteen referees participated in the tournament: four Europeans ÿ two Belgians (Henri Christophe and John Langenus), a Frenchman, and a Romanian (Constantin R?dulescu, also the Romanian team coach),[16] and eleven from the Americas ÿ among them six Uruguayans. In order to eliminate differences in the application of the Laws of the Game, the referees were invited to one short meeting to iron out the most conflicting issues arising from the game.[17]\\r\\nOf all the refereeing appointments, the two that attracted most attention were that of Gilberto de Almeida Rgo in the match between Argentina and France, in which the Brazilian referee blew for full-time six minutes early, and that of the Bolivian Ulises Saucedo's in the Argentina and Mexico encounter, which Argentina won 6ÿ3. During the game Saucedo, who was also the coach of Bolivia,[16] awarded three penalties.\\r\\nThe following is the list of officials to serve as referees and linesmen. Officials in italics were only employed as linesmen during the tournament.\\r\\nThe 13 teams were drawn into four groups, with Group 1 containing four teams, and the others containing only three. Each group played a round-robin format, with two points awarded for a win and one point for a draw. If two teams had tied on points to win a group, a play-off would have been used to decide the group winner; however, this was not necessary. The four group winners progressed to the knockout semi-final stage. Extra time was available in the knockout matches if the two teams were level after ninety minutes, but it was not required.[citation needed]\\r\\nUruguay, Argentina, Brazil, and the United States were seeded, and were kept apart in the draw,[18] which took place in Montevideo once all the teams arrived.[19]\\r\\nSince there were no qualifying games, the opening two matches of the tournament were the first World Cup games ever played, taking place simultaneously on 13 July 1930; France beat Mexico 4ÿ1 at the Estadio Pocitos, while the United States defeated Belgium 3ÿ0 at the same time at the Estadio Gran Parque Central. France's Lucien Laurent was the scorer of the first World Cup goal.[20]\\r\\nLucien Laurent[9]\\r\\nThe first group was the only one to contain four teams: Argentina, Chile, France and Mexico. Two days after France's victory over Mexico, they faced group favourites Argentina. Injuries hindered France; goalkeeper Alex Thpot had to leave the field after 20?minutes, and Laurent, after a fierce tackle by Luis Monti, spent most of the match limping. However, they held out for most of the match, only succumbing to an 81st-minute goal scored from a Monti free kick.[21] The game featured an officiating controversy when referee Almeida Rgo erroneously blew the final whistle six minutes early, with Frenchman Marcel Langiller clear on goal; play only resumed after protests from the French players.[22] Though France had played twice in 48 hours, Chile had yet to play their first match. They faced Mexico the following day, gaining a comfortable 3ÿ0 win.[23]\\r\\nFrance's final match, against Chile, featured the first penalty kick of the tournament and World Cup history. The first goalkeeper to save a penalty was Alex Thpot of France on 19 July 1930, saving from Chile's Carlos Vidal in the 30th minute of the match.[24] In Argentina's second match, against Mexico, three penalty kicks were awarded. During the same match on 19 July 1930 Mexico's Oscar Bonfiglio Martnez saved another penalty at the 23rd minute of the match against Argentina's Fernando Paternoster.[24] Guillermo Stbile scored a hat-trick in his international debut[25] as Argentina won 6ÿ3, despite the absence of their captain Manuel Ferreira, who had returned to Buenos Aires to take a law exam.[26] Qualification was decided by the group's final match, contested by Argentina and Chile, who had beaten France and Mexico, respectively. The game was marred by a brawl sparked by a foul on Arturo Torres by Monti.[22] Argentina won 3ÿ1 against their neighbours and advanced to the semi-finals.\\r\\nThe second group contained Brazil, Bolivia and Yugoslavia. Brazil, the group seeds, were expected to progress, but in the group's opening match, unexpectedly lost 2ÿ1 to Yugoslavia.[27] Going into the tournament Bolivia had never previously won an international match. For their opener they paid tribute to the hosts by wearing shirts each emblazoned with a single letter, spelling \\"Viva Uruguay\\" as the team lined up.[28] Both of Bolivia's matches followed a similar pattern, a promising start gradually transforming into heavy defeat. Against Yugoslavia, they held out for an hour before conceding, but were four goals down by the final whistle.[23] Misfortune played its part; several Bolivian goals were disallowed.[28] Against Brazil, when both teams had only pride to play for, the score was 1ÿ0 to Brazil at half-time. Brazil added three more in the second half, two of them scored by the multi-sportsman Preguinho.[29] Yugoslavia qualified for the semi-finals.\\r\\nHosts Uruguay were in a group with Peru and Romania. The opening match in this group saw the first player expulsion in the competition, when Plcido Galindo of Peru was dismissed against Romania. The Romanians made their man advantage pay; their 3ÿ1 win included two late goals. This match had the smallest crowd of any in World Cup history. The official attendance was 2,459, but the actual figure is generally accepted to be around 300.[30]\\r\\nBecause of construction delays at Estadio Centenario, Uruguay's first match was not played until five days into the tournament. The first to be held at the Centenario, it was preceded by a ceremony in honour of the Uruguayan centenary celebrations. The Uruguayan team spent the four weeks preceding the match in a training camp, at which strict discipline was exercised. Goalkeeper Andrs Mazali was dropped from the squad for breaking a curfew to visit his wife.[31] One hundred years to the day of the creation of Uruguay's first constitution, the hosts won a tight match against Peru 1ÿ0.[32] Spectators praised Peru's defense, and this turned out to be the only tournament match in which Uruguay scored only one goal.[33] The result was viewed as a poor performance by the Uruguayan press, but lauded in Peru.[32] Uruguay subsequently defeated Romania with ease, scoring four first half goals to win 4ÿ0.\\r\\nThe United States dominated the fourth group. The American team, which contained a significant number of new caps, were reputedly nicknamed \\"the shot-putters\\" by an unnamed source in the French contingent.[2] They beat their first opponents, Belgium, 3ÿ0. The ease of the victory was unexpected; Uruguayan newspaper Imparcial wrote that \\"the large score of the American victory has really surprised the experts\\".[34] Belgian reports bemoaned the state of the pitch and refereeing decisions, claiming that the second goal was offside.[34] The group's second match, played in windy conditions,[35] witnessed the first tournament hat-trick, scored by Bert Patenaude of the United States against Paraguay. Until 10 November 2006, the first hat-trick that FIFA acknowledged had been scored by Guillermo Stbile of Argentina, two days after Patenaude; however, in 2006 FIFA announced that Patenaude's claim to being the first hat-trick scorer was valid, as a goal previously assigned to teammate Tom Florie was reattributed to Patenaude.[36][37] With the United States having secured qualification, the final match in the group was a dead rubber. Paraguay beat Belgium by a 1ÿ0 margin.[23]\\r\\nThe four group winners, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Uruguay and the United States, moved to the semi-finals. The two semi-final matches saw identical scores. The first semi-final was played between the USA and Argentina on a rain-drenched pitch. The United States team, which featured six British-born players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after ten minutes to a broken leg as the match became violent.[38] A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1ÿ0 half-time lead. In the second half, the strength of the United States team was overwhelmed by the pace of the Argentinian attacks, the match finishing 6ÿ1 to Argentina.[39]\\r\\nIn the second semi-final there were shades of the 1924 Summer Olympics match between Yugoslavia and Uruguay. Here, though, Yugoslavia took a surprise lead through Vujadinovi?. Uruguay then took a 2ÿ1 lead. Then shortly before half-time Yugoslavia had a goal disallowed by a controversial offside decision.[27] The hosts scored three more in the second half to win 6ÿ1, Pedro Cea completing a hat-trick.[39]\\r\\nThe now-traditional third place play-off was not established until 1934, so the format of the 1930 World Cup is unique in not distinguishing between the third and fourth placed teams. Occasional sources, notably a FIFA Bulletin from 1984, incorrectly imply that a third-place match occurred and was won 3ÿ1 by Yugoslavia.[40] Accounts differ as to whether a third-place match was originally scheduled. According to a 2009 book by Hyder Jawad, Yugoslavia refused to play a third-place match because they were upset with the refereeing in their semi-final against Uruguay.[41]\\r\\nAt the end of the championship, the captains of the United States team (Tom Florie)[42] and Yugoslavia (Milutin Ivkovi?)[43] both received bronze medals. Yet a FIFA technical committee report on the 1986 World Cup included full retrospective rankings of all teams at all previous World Cup finals; this report ranked the United States third and Yugoslavia fourth, due to a better goal difference on otherwise identical records,[44] a practice since continued by FIFA.[45] In 2010, the son of Kosta Had?i, the chief of Yugoslav delegation at the 1930 World Cup and the vice-president of the Football Association of Yugoslavia at the time, claimed that Yugoslavia, as a team, has been awarded one bronze medal, which has been kept by Had?i himself and his family for the following 80 years. According to this source, Yugoslavia was placed third because of the semi-finals loss to the eventual champions, Uruguay.[46][47]\\r\\nThe resounding wins for Uruguay and Argentina in the semi-finals meant the final was a repeat of the matchup in the 1928 Olympic final, which Uruguay had won 2ÿ1 after a replay.\\r\\nThe final was played at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine supporters crossed the river with the war cry Victoria o muerte (\\"victory or death\\"), dispelling any uncertainty as to whether the tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate,[27] and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10ÿ15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before kick-off, let alone reach the stadium.[48] At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons.[49] The gates were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full,[27] the official attendance 93,000.[50] A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second.[2] Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness.[39] Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats on the eve of the match. The referee was Belgian John Langenus, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety.[51] One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.[52]\\r\\nThe hosts scored the opening goal through Pablo Dorado, a low shot from a position on the right.[53] Argentina, displaying superior passing ability, responded strongly. Within eight minutes they were back on level terms; Carlos Peucelle received a Ferreira through-ball, beat his marker and equalised.[53] Shortly before half-time leading tournament goalscorer Guillermo Stbile gave Argentina a 2ÿ1 lead. Uruguay captain Nasazzi protested, maintaining that Stbile was offside, but to no avail.[51] In the second half Uruguay gradually became ascendant. Shortly after Monti missed a chance to make the score 3ÿ1, Uruguay attacked in numbers, and Pedro Cea scored an equaliser.[53] Ten minutes later a goal by Santos Iriarte gave Uruguay the lead, and just before full-time Castro made it 4ÿ2 to seal the win.[51] Langenus ended the match a minute later, and Uruguay thus added the title World Cup winners to their mantle of Olympic champions. Jules Rimet presented the World Cup Trophy, which was later named for him, to the head of the Uruguayan Football Association, Ra~l Jude.[54] The following day was declared a national holiday in Uruguay;[50] in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, a mob threw stones at the Uruguayan consulate.[55] Francisco Varallo (who played as a forward for Argentina) was the last player of the final to die, on 30 August 2010.[56]\\r\\nFrance, Yugoslavia and the United States all played friendlies in South America following the competition. Brazil played France on 1 August, Yugoslavia on 10 August and the United States on 17 August,[57] while Argentina hosted Yugoslavia on 3 August.[58]\\r\\nUruguay's aggregate goal difference of +12 over four games, at an average of +3 per match, remains the highest average goal difference per match of any World Cup champion, and the second highest of any World Cup Finals participant, after Hungary in 1954.\\r\\nWith eight goals, Guillermo Stbile was the top scorer in the tournament. In total, 70 goals were scored by 37 different players, with only one of them credited as an own goal.\\r\\nIn 1986, FIFA published a report that ranked all teams in each World Cup up to and including 1986, based on progress in the competition, overall results and quality of the opposition.[68][69] The rankings for the 1930 tournament were as follows:\\r\\nThe last surviving player from Uruguay's World Cup-winning side was Ernesto Mascheroni, who died on 3 July 1984 at the age of 76. He was outlived by reserve defender Emilio Recoba who died on 12 September 1992 (aged 87), but did not play any matches in the tournament. However, many other players who participated in the tournament were still alive by this stage and the last surviving player from the tournament was Argentina's Francisco Varallo, who died on 30 August 2010 at the age of 100 ÿ eighty years after the tournament.[70]\\r\\nA recreation of the tournament from the point of view of the Yugoslavian team can be seen in the 2014 Serbian film See You in Montevideo.","input":"Who won the first ever world cup football?"},{"output":"Newport News Shipbuilding","context":"Gerald R. Ford class (or Ford class, previously known as CVN-21 class), is a class of supercarrier being built to replace the USS?Enterprise (CVN-65) and some of the United States Navy's existing Nimitz-class carriers, beginning with the delivery of CVN-78, USS?Gerald R. Ford. The new vessels have a hull similar to the Nimitz carriers, but introduce technologies since developed such as the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System, as well as other design features intended to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs, including sailing with smaller crews.[N 1][8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCarriers of the Ford class will have:[10]\\r\\nThe US Navy aims to use modern equipment and extensive automation to reduce the crew size and the total cost of future aircraft carriers.[16] The biggest visible difference from earlier supercarriers will be the more aft location of the island (superstructure).[17] Ships of the Ford class are intended to sustain 160 sorties per day for 30-plus days, with a surge capability of 270 sorties per day.[18][19] Director of Operational Testing Michael Gilmore has criticized the assumptions used in these forecasts as unrealistic and has indicated sortie rates similar to the 120/240 per day of the Nimitz class would be acceptable.[19][20]\\r\\nThe current Nimitz-class aircraft carrier in US naval service has been part of United States power projection strategy since Nimitz was commissioned in 1975. Displacing about 100,000 tons when fully loaded, a Nimitz-class carrier can steam faster than 30 knots, cruise without resupply for 90 days, and launch aircraft to strike targets hundreds of miles away.[21] The endurance of this class is exemplified by USS?Theodore Roosevelt, which spent 159?days underway in support of Operation Enduring Freedom without visiting a port or being refueled.[22]\\r\\nThe Nimitz design has accommodated many new technologies over the decades, but it has limited ability to support the most recent technical advances. As a 2005 Rand report said, \\"The biggest problems facing the Nimitz class are the limited electrical power generation capability and the upgrade-driven increase in ship weight and erosion of the center-of-gravity margin needed to maintain ship stability.\\"[23]\\r\\nWith these constraints in mind, the US Navy developed what was initially known as the CVN-21 program, which ultimately evolved into CVN-78, Gerald R. Ford. Improvements were made through developing technologies and more efficient design. Major design changes include a larger flight deck, improvements in weapons and material handling, a new propulsion plant design that requires fewer people to operate and maintain, and a new, smaller island that has been pushed aft. Technological advances in electromagnetics have led to the development of an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) and an Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG). An integrated warfare system, the Ship Self-Defense System (SSDS), has been developed to allow the ship to more easily take on new missions. The new Dual Band Radar (DBR) combines S-band and X-band radar.[24] Flight deck changes support the requirements for a higher sortie rate, around 160 a day with surges to 270.\\r\\nThese advances will allow the new Gerald R. Fordÿclass carriers to launch 25% more sorties, generate triple the electrical power, improved efficiency, and offer crew quality-of-life improvements.[7][8]\\r\\nChanges to the flight deck are the most visible differences between the Nimitz and Gerald R. Ford classes. Several sections have been altered to improve aircraft handling, storage, and flow, all in the service of increasing the sortie rate.\\r\\nCatapult No. 4 on the Nimitz class cannot launch fully loaded aircraft because of a deficiency of wing clearance along the edge of the flight deck.[25] CVN-78 will have no catapult-specific restrictions on launching aircraft, but still retains four catapults, two bow and two waist.[8] The number of aircraft lifts from hangar deck to flight deck level was reduced from four to three.\\r\\nAnother major change is that the smaller, redesigned island will be further aft than those of older carriers. This shift creates deck space for a centralized rearming and refueling location, and thereby reduces the number of times that an aircraft will have to be moved after landing before it can be relaunched. Fewer aircraft movements require, in turn, fewer deck hands to accomplish them, reducing the size of the ship's crew and increasing sortie rate.\\r\\nAs well, the movement of weapons from storage and assembly to the aircraft on the flight deck has been streamlined and accelerated. Ordnance will be moved to the centralized rearming location via relocated, higher-capacity weapons elevators that use linear motors.[26] The new path that ordnance follows does not cross any areas of aircraft movement, thereby reducing traffic problems in the hangars and on the flight deck. According to Rear Admiral Dennis M. Dwyer, these changes will make it hypothetically possible to rearm the airplanes in \\"minutes instead of hours\\".[27]\\r\\nThe new Bechtel A1B reactor for the Ford-class is smaller and simpler, requires fewer crew, and yet is far more powerful than the Nimitz-class A4W reactor. Two reactors will be installed on each Ford-class carrier, providing almost 700 MW which is 25% greater than 550 MW of the two A4W. As the Ford-class is primarily an electric boat; electrical capacity of the reactors was increased 2.5 times that of the Nimitz-class.[28][29]\\r\\nThe propulsion and power plant of the Nimitz-class carriers was designed in the 1960s, when onboard technologies did not require the same quantity of electrical power that modern technologies do. \\"New technologies added to the Nimitz-class ships have generated increased demands for electricity; the current base load leaves little margin to meet expanding demands for power.\\"[30]\\r\\nCompared to the Nimitz-class reactor, the Ford-class reactor has about half as many valves, piping, major pumps, condensers, and generators. The steam-generating system uses fewer than 200 valves and only eight pipe sizes. These improvements lead to simpler construction, reduced maintenance, and lower manpower requirements as well as to a more compact system that requires less space in the ship. The modernization of the plant led to a higher core energy density, lower demands for pumping power, a simpler construction, and the use of modern electronic controls and displays. The new plant requires just one-third the watchstanding requirements and a decrease of required maintenance.[30]\\r\\nA larger power output is a major component to the integrated warfare system. Engineers took extra steps to ensure that integrating unforeseen technological advances onto a Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier would be possible. The Navy expects the Gerald R. Ford class will be part of the fleet for 90 years, until the year 2105, which means that the class must successfully accept new technology over the decades.\\r\\nThe Nimitz-class aircraft carriers used steam-powered catapults to launch aircraft. The Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) installed on the Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier is more efficient, smaller, lighter, more powerful, and easier to control. Increased control means that EMALS will be able to launch heavier and lighter aircraft than the steam catapult. Also, the use of a controlled force will reduce the stress on airframes, resulting in less maintenance and a longer lifetime for the aircraft. (EMALS will not be retrofitted onto the Nimitz class, which cannot generate enough electricity to power it.)\\r\\nElectromagnets are also being used in the new Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) system. The current system relies on hydraulics to slow and stop a landing aircraft. While the hydraulic system is effective, as demonstrated by more than fifty years of implementation, the AAG system offers a number of improvements. The current steam system is unable to capture UAVs without damaging them due to extreme stresses on the airframe. UAVs do not have the necessary mass to drive the large hydraulic piston used to trap heavier, manned airplanes. By using electromagnetics the energy absorption is controlled by a turbo-electric engine. This makes the trap smoother and reduces shock on airframes. Even though the system will look the same from the flight deck as its predecessor, it will be more flexible, safe, and reliable, and will require less maintenance and manning.[31]\\r\\nAnother addition to the Gerald R. Ford class is an integrated Active electronically scanned array search and tracking radar system. The dual-band radar (DBR) was being developed for both the Zumwalt-class guided missile destroyers and the Ford-class aircraft carriers by Raytheon. The island can be kept smaller by replacing six to ten radar antennas with a single six-faced radar. The DBR works by combining the X band AN/SPY-3 multifunction radar with the S band Volume Search Radar (VSR) emitters, distributed into three phased arrays.[32] The S-band radar was later deleted from the Zumwalt class destroyers as a cost saving measure.[14]\\r\\nThe three faces dedicated to the X-band radar are responsible for low altitude tracking and radar illumination, while the other three faces dedicated to the S-band are responsible for target search and tracking regardless of weather. \\"Operating simultaneously over two electromagnetic frequency ranges, the DBR marks the first time this functionality has been achieved using two frequencies coordinated by a single resource manager.\\"[24]\\r\\nThis new system has no moving parts, therefore minimizing maintenance and manning requirements for operation. The carrier will be armed with the Raytheon Evolved Sea Sparrow missile (ESSM), which defends against high-speed, highly maneuverable anti-ship missiles. The close-in weapon system, and the rolling airframe missile (RAM) from Raytheon and Ramsys GmbH are also on board.\\r\\nThe AN/SPY-3 consists of three active arrays and the Receiver/Exciter (REX) cabinets abovedecks and the Signal and Data Processor (SDP) subsystem below-decks. The VSR has a similar architecture, with the beamforming and narrowband down-conversion functionality occurring in two additional cabinets per array. A central controller (the resource manager) resides in the Data Processor (DP). The DBR is the first radar system that uses a central controller and two active-array radars operating at different frequencies. The DBR gets its power from the Common Array Power System (CAPS), which comprises Power Conversion Units (PCUs) and Power Distribution Units (PDUs). The DBR is cooled via a closed-loop cooling system called the Common Array Cooling System (CACS).[33]\\r\\nThe REX consists of a digital and an analog portion. The digital portion of the REX provides system-level timing and control. The analog portion contains the exciter and the receiver. The exciter is a low-amplitude and phase noise system that uses direct frequency synthesis. The radars noise characteristics support the high clutter cancellation requirements required in the broad range of maritime operating environments that DBR will likely encounter. The direct frequency synthesis allows a wide range of pulse repetition frequencies, pulse widths, and modulation schemes to be created.\\r\\nThe receiver has high dynamic range to support high clutter levels caused by close returns from range-ambiguous Doppler effect waveforms. The receiver has both narrow band and wideband channels, as well as multichannel capabilities to support monopulse radar processing and side lobe blanking. The receiver generates digital data and sends the data to the signal processors.\\r\\nThe DBR uses IBM commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) supercomputers to provide control and signal processing. DBR is the first radar system to use COTS systems to perform the signal processing. Using COTS systems reduces development costs and increases system reliability and maintainability. The high-performance COTS servers perform signal analysis using radar and digital signal processing techniques, including channel equalization, clutter filtering, Doppler processing, impulse editing, and implementation of a variety of advanced electronic protect algorithms. The IBM supercomputers are installed in cabinets that provide shock and vibration isolation. The DP contains the resource manager, the tracker, and the command and control processor, which processes commands from the combat system.\\r\\nThe DBR utilizes a multi-tier, dual-band tracker, which consists of a local X band tracker, a local S band tracker, and a central tracker. The central tracker merges the local tracker data together and directs the individual-band-trackers updates. The X band tracker is optimized for low latency to support its mission of providing defense against fast, low-flying missiles, while the VSR tracker is optimized for throughput due to the large-volume search area coverage requirements.\\r\\nThe combat system develops doctrine-based response recommendations based on the current tactical situation and sends the recommendations to the DBR. The combat system also has control of which modes the radar will perform. Unlike previous-generation radars, the DBR does not require an operator and has no manned display consoles. The system uses information about the current environment and doctrine from the combat system to make automated decisions, not only reducing reaction times, but also reducing the risks associated with human error. The only human interaction is for maintenance and repair activities.\\r\\nThe Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) is a new design surveillance radar that is to be installed in the second Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier, USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79), in lieu of the Dual Band radar. The America-class?amphibious assault ships starting with LHA-8 and the planned LX(R) will also have this radar.[34] The EASR suites initial per-unit cost will be about $180 million less than the DBR, for which the estimate is about $500 million.[35]\\r\\nEach new technology and design feature integrated into the Ford-class aircraft carrier improves sortie generation, manning requirements, and operational capabilities. New defense systems, such as free-electron laser directed-energy weapons, dynamic armor, and tracking systems will require more power. \\"Only half of the electrical power-generation capability on CVN-78 is needed to run currently planned systems, including EMALS. CVN-78 will thus have the power reserves that the Nimitz class lacks to run lasers and dynamic armor.\\"[36] The addition of new technologies, power systems, design layout, and better control systems results in an increased sortie rate of 25% over the Nimitz-class and a 25% reduction in manpower required to operate.[37]\\r\\nBreakthrough waste management technology will be deployed on Gerald R Ford. Co-developed with the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, PyroGenesis Canada Inc., was in 2008 awarded the contract to outfit the ship with a Plasma Arc Waste Destruction System (PAWDS). This compact system will treat all combustible solid waste generated on board the ship. After having completed factory acceptance testing in Montreal, the system was scheduled to be shipped to the Huntington Ingalls shipyard in late 2011 for installation on the carrier.[38]\\r\\nThe Navy is actively developing a weapon system called the free-electron laser (FEL) to address the cruise missile threat and the swarm-boat threat against Ford-class carriers.[39][40][41][42][43] An FEL uses an electron gun to generate a stream of electrons. The electrons are then sent into a linear particle accelerator to boost them to near light speeds. The accelerated electrons are then sent into a device, known informally as a wiggler, that exposes the electrons to a transverse magnetic field, which causes the electrons to wiggle from side to side and release some of their energy in the form of light (photons). The photons are then bounced between mirrors and emitted as a coherent beam of laser light. To increase the efficiency of the system some electrons are then recycled to the front of the particle accelerator via an energy recovery loop. The cost to fire one shot from an FEL is about $1 and draws about 10 MW of electrical power.[citation needed]\\r\\nNewport News Shipbuilding used a full-scale three-dimensional product model developed in Dassault Systmes CATIA V5 release 8 (which includes special features useful to shipbuilders[44]) to design and plan the construction of the Ford class of aircraft carriers. This enables engineers and designers to test visual integration in design, engineering, planning and construction of components and subsystems. CVN-78 is the first aircraft carrier to be designed in a full-scale 3D product model. This modeling enabled the rooms within the ship to be modular, so that future upgrades can be implemented by designers simply by swapping a box in and locking it down.\\r\\nThis method of designing workflow also resulted in improvements to weapon handling procedures and an increase in potential sorties-per-day. Weapons-handling paths on Nimitz-class ships were designed for the potential nuclear missions of the Cold War. The current flow of weapons from storage areas in the interior of the Nimitz-class ship to loading on aircraft involves several horizontal and vertical movements to various staging and build-up locations within the ship. These movements around the ship are time-consuming and manpower-intensive and typically involve sailors manually moving weapons loaded on carts. Also, the current locations of some of the Nimitz-class weapons elevators conflict with the flow of aircraft on the flight deck, slowing down the generation of sorties or making some elevators unusable during flight operations.\\r\\nThe CVN 21 class was designed to have better weapons movement paths, largely eliminating horizontal movements within the ship. Current plans call for advanced weapons elevators to move from storage areas to dedicated weapons-handling areas. Sailors would use motorized carts to move the weapons from storage to the elevators at different levels of the weapons magazines. Linear motors are being considered for the advanced weapons elevators. The elevators will also be relocated such that they will not impede aircraft operations on the flight deck. The redesign of the weapons movement paths and the location of the weapons elevators on the flight deck will reduce manpower and contribute to a much higher sortie generation rate.[45]\\r\\nThe Ford class is designed to accommodate the new Joint Strike Fighter carrier variant aircraft (F-35C), but aircraft development and testing delays have affected integration activities on CVN-78. These integration activities include testing the F-35C with CVN-78s EMALS and advanced arresting gear system and testing the ships storage capabilities for the F-35Cs lithium-ion batteries (which provide start-up and back-up power), tires, and wheels. As a result of F-35C developmental delays, the US Navy will not field the aircraft until at least 2018one year after CVN-78 delivery. As a result, the Navy has deferred critical F-35C integration activities, which introduces risk of system incompatibilities and costly retrofits to the ship after it is delivered to the Navy.[46]\\r\\nSystems that reduce crew workload have allowed the ships company on Ford-class carriers to total only 2,600 sailors, about 600 fewer than a Nimitz-class carrier. The massive, 180-man berthing areas on the Nimitz class are replaced by 40-rack berthing areas on Ford-class carriers. The smaller berthings are quieter and the layout requires less foot traffic through other spaces.[47] The racks are typically stacked three high, with one locker per person and extra lockers for those without storage space under their rack. The berthings do not feature modern sit-up racks with more headroom (each rack can only accommodate a sailor lying down). Each berthing has an associated head, including showers, vacuum-powered septic-system toilets (no urinals since the berthings are built gender-neutral)[48] and sinks to reduce travel and traffic to access those facilities. Wifi-enabled lounges are located across the passageway in separate spaces from the berthings racks.[47]\\r\\nConstruction began on 11 August 2005, when Northrop Grumman held a ceremonial steel cut for a 15-ton plate that will form part of a side shell unit of the carrier.[49] Construction began on components of CVN-78 in early 2007[50] and is nearing completion. It is under the final steps of construction at Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding) in Newport News, Virginia. This is the only shipyard in the United States capable of building nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.\\r\\nIn 2005, it was estimated to cost at least $8?billion excluding the $5?billion spent on research and development (though that was not expected to be representative of the cost of future members of the class).[16] A 2009 report said that Ford would cost $14?billion including research and development, and the actual cost of the carrier itself would be $9?billion.[51] The life-cycle cost per operating day of a carrier strike group (including aircraft) was estimated at $6.5 million in 2013 published by the Center for New American Security.[52]\\r\\nOriginally, a total of three carriers have been authorized for construction, but if the Nimitz-class carriers and Enterprise were to be replaced on a one-for-one basis, eleven carriers would be required over the life of the program. However, the last Nimitz-class aircraft carrier is not scheduled to be decommissioned until 2058.\\r\\nIn a speech on 6 April 2009, then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that the program would shift to a five-year building program so as to place it on a \\"more fiscally sustainable path\\". Such a measure would result in ten carriers after 2040.[53]\\r\\nAs construction of CVN-78 progresses, the shipbuilder is discovering first-of-class type design changes, which it will use to update the model before the follow-on ship construction. To date, several of these design changes have related to EMALS configuration changes, which have required electrical, wiring, and other changes within the ship. Although the Navy reports that these EMALS-related changes are nearing completion, it anticipates additional design changes stemming from remaining advanced arresting gear development and testing. In total, over 1,200 anticipated design changes remain to be completed (out of nearly 19,000 planned changes). According to the Navy, many of these 19,000 changes were programmed into the construction schedule early ona result of the governments decision at contract award to introduce improvements during construction to the ships warfare systems, which are heavily dependent on evolving commercial technologies.[46]\\r\\nThere was a movement by the USS?America Carrier Veterans' Association to have CVN-78 named after America rather than after President Ford.[54] Eventually, the amphibious assault ship LHA-6 was named America.\\r\\nOn 27 May 2011, the U.S. Department of Defense announced the name of CVN-79 would be USS?John F. Kennedy.[55]\\r\\nOn 1 December 2012, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced that CVN-80 would be named USS Enterprise. The information was delivered during a prerecorded speech as part of the deactivation ceremony for the previous USS Enterprise (CVN-65). The future Enterprise (CVN-80) will be the ninth U.S. Navy ship to bear this name.[56]\\r\\nThere are expected to be ten ships of this class.[57] To date, four have been announced:","input":"Who built the gerald r ford aircraft carrier?"},{"output":"in 1968","context":"Knotts Berry Farm is a 160-acre amusement park in Buena Park, California, United States, owned by Cedar Fair. In 2017, it was the tenth most-visited theme park in North America. Knott's Berry Farm is also the most-visited theme park in the Cedar Fair chain.[3] The park features 35 rides including roller coasters, family rides, children's rides, water rides, and historical rides, and it employs about 10,000 seasonal and full-time employees.[4]\\r\\nThe theme park sits on the site of a former berry farm established by Walter Knott, Cordelia Knott, and their family. Beginning around 1920, the Knott family sold berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along State Route 39. In 1934, the Knotts began selling fried chicken dinners in a tea room on the property, and the Knotts built several shops and other attractions to entertain visitors. Cordelia Knott's efforts in the Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant were essential to putting Knott's Berry Farm on the map, and the ensuing crowds prompted the creation of even more tourist attractions. In 1940, Walter Knott began constructing a replica ghost town on the property. Knott added several other attractions over the years, and began charging admission to the attractions in 1968. In 1983, Knott's Berry Farm added Camp Snoopy, which began the park's present-day association with the Peanuts characters.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, following the deaths of Walter and Cordelia Knott, their children sold the theme park to Cedar Fair and the family's food business to ConAgra Foods, which subsequently sold it to J. M. Smucker. Cedar Fair has continued to expand the theme park, adding Knott's Soak City in 1999 and adding new rides to the original park.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme park sits on the site of a former berry farm established by Walter Knott and his family.

In 1934, the Knotts began selling fried chicken dinners in a tea room on the property, later called \\"Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant\\". The dinners soon became a major tourist draw, and the Knotts built several shops and other attractions to entertain visitors while waiting for a seat in the restaurant. In 1940, Walter Knott began constructing a replica Ghost Town on the property, the beginning of the present-day theme park. The idea of an amusement park really picked up in the 1950s when Walter Knott opened a \\"summer-long county fair\\".\\r\\nIn 1968, for the first time, an admission price was required to get into the park, originally set at 25 cents. The Calico log ride was added in 1969. The park became a popular destination for conservative college students in the 1960s, especially as conservative organizations like the California Free Enterprise Association, the Libres Foundation, and the Americanism Educational League were based there.[5] According to Assistant Professor Caroline Rolland-Diamond of the Paris West University Nanterre La Dfense:\\r\\nit also appealed to conservative Americans, young and old, because the idealized representation of a past devoid of social and racial tensions that it offered stood in sharp contrast with the political and social upheavals affecting California since the Free Speech Movement erupted at the University of California at Berkeley in 1964.\\r\\nOn April 12, 1974, Cordelia Knott died. Walter turned his attention toward political causes,[7][8] Roaring Twenties[9] re-themed Gypsy Camp in the 1970s with the addition of a nostalgic traditional amusement area, Wheeler Dealer Bumper Cars, Knott's Bear-y Tales.

Parachute Sky Jump boarded one or two standing riders anticipating the thrill of the drop into baskets beneath a faux parachute canopy. From the top, eight arms supported the vertical cable tracks of wire rope which lifted the baskets. The Sky Cabin ringed the support pole with a single floor of seats that are enclosed behind windows. The Sky Cabin ring revolves slowly as it rises to the top and back offering a pleasantly changing vista. Sky Cabin is very sensitive to weather and passenger motion, such as walking, which is prohibited during the trip. During winds 25+?mph or rain it is closed. When built, Sky Tower was the tallest structure in Orange County (a distinction briefly held by WindSeeker before its relocation to Worlds of Fun in 2012.)\\r\\nMotorcycle Chase, modernized steeplechase rollercoaster built in 1976 by Arrow Development, featured single motorbike themed vehicles racing side-by-side, each on one of four parallel tracks, launched together.[10] One or two riders straddled each \\"Indian motorcycle\\" attraction vehicle. The tubular steel monorail track closely followed dips and bumps in \\"the road\\" and tilted to lean riders about the curves. Gasoline Alley, an electric steel-guiderail car ride below, was built together and intimately intertwined, which enhanced ride-to-ride interaction thrill value.[11] Rider safety concerns of the high center of gravity coupled with the method of rider restraints caused it to be re-themed Wacky Soap Box Racers with vehicles themed to look like soap box racers, each seating two riders, strapped in low (nearly straddling the track), surrounded by the close fitting car sides, and the dips and bumps of the track were straightened flat in 1980. Motorcycle Chase/Wacky Soap Box Racers was removed 1996 for a dueling loop coaster Windjammer Surf Racers and now Xcelerator, a vertical launch coaster, takes its place.\\r\\nOn December 3, 1981, Walter Knott died, survived by his children who would continue to operate Knott's as a family business for another fourteen years.\\r\\nIn the 1980s, Knott's built the Barn Dance featured Bobbi & Clyde as the house band. It was during the height of the \\"Urban Cowboy\\" era. The \\"Barn Dance\\" was featured in Knott's TV Commercials.\\r\\nDuring the 1980s, Knott's met the competition in Southern California theme parks by theming a new land and building two massive attractions:\\r\\nThe Boomerang roller coaster replaced the Corkscrew[9] in 1990 with a lift shuttle train passing to and fro through a cobra roll and a vertical loop for six inversions each trip.\\r\\nMystery Lodge (1994),[12] inspired by General Motors \\"Spirit Lodge\\" pavilion, was a live show augmented with Pepper's ghost and other special effects, which was among the most popular exhibits at Expo 86 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which was produced by Bob Rogers of BRC Imagination Arts[13] and created with the assistance of the Kwagulth Native reserve in the village of Alert Bay, British Columbia.[14] Mystery Lodge recreates a quiet summer night in Alert Bay, then guests \\"move inside\\" the longhouse and listen to the storyteller weave a tale of the importance of family from the smoke of the bonfire.\\r\\nThe Jaguar! was opened June 17, 1995, to add another roller coaster to the mix of Fiesta Village alongside Montezooma's Revenge.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, after Walter and Cordelia died, their children decided to sell off their businesses:\\r\\nIn the late 1990s Cedar Fair acquired the Buena Park Hotel at the corner of Grand Ave. and Crescent. It was then brought up to Radisson standards and branded Radisson Resort Hotel as a franchise. In 2004, the park renamed the Radisson Resort Hotel the Knott's Berry Farm Resort Hotel.\\r\\nIn 1995, the Knott family sold the food specialty business to ConAgra Foods, which later re-sold the brand to The J.M. Smucker Company in 2008.\\r\\nIn 1997, the Knott family sold the amusement park operations to Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Initially, the Knotts were given an opportunity to sell the park to The Walt Disney Company. The park would have been amalgamated into the Disneyland Resort and converted into Disney's America, which had previously failed to be built near Washington, D.C. The Knotts refused to sell the park to Disney out of fear most of what Walter Knott had built would be eliminated.\\r\\nSince being acquired by Cedar Fair, the park has seen an aggressive shift towards thrill rides, with the construction of a number of large roller coasters and the addition of a high-performance Shoot-the-Chutes ride Perilous Plunge. Perilous Plunge had the record of being the tallest and steepest water ride in the world until September 2012 when it was closed and removed.[15] Also, in 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced that the most popular ride at the park, the Timber Mountain Log Ride, would be closed for a major five-month refurbishment, led by Garner Holt Productions, Inc.[16]\\r\\nOn May 25, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm added three new family rides on the site of former Perilous Plunge. They include: Coast Rider (wild mouse roller coaster), Pacific Scrambler (Scrambler ride) and Surfside Gliders. All three of the rides added to the Boardwalk theme. The old bridge which connected the exit of Perlious Plunge and the boardwalk is now used as the entrance to Surfside Gliders and Pacific Scrambler. The Boomerang roller coaster was also repainted a lime-green color as part of the Boardwalk expansion.\\r\\nOn September 2, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced that Windseeker would be removed from the park. The ride was removed and sent to Worlds of Fun for the 2014 season.\\r\\nOn November 22, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm made a major announcement for the 2014 operating season; the famous and historical Calico Mine Ride would be closed for a major six-month refurbishment beginning in January 2014.[17]\\r\\nThe park's annual Knott's Scary Farm has drawn crowds since 1973. The idea for this event was presented at one of the regularly scheduled round table meetings for managers by Patricia Pawson. The actual event was created by Bill Hollingshead, Gary Salisbury, Martha Boyd and Gene Witham, along with other members of the Knott's Berry Farm Entertainment Department as documented in the DVD Season of Screams. Initially fake corpses and other static figures were rented from Hollywood prop house, but Bud Hurlbut, the creator/concessionaire of the Mine Ride, Log Ride and other rides at Knott's, decided that this wasn't enough.[26] He dressed up in a gorilla suit, and started scaring guests on the Mine Ride. Halloween Haunt was an instant hit, and by the next year, the event sold out nightly.[27] During this special ticketed event, the entire park (or major portions of it) re-themes itself into a \\"haunted house\\" style attraction in the form of mazes and \\"scare zones\\" in the evening. Over a thousand specially employed monsters are also scatteredoften hidden out of viewthroughout the park at this time. Some of the characters have become well-known, such as the green witch, which has been portrayed by Charlene Parker since 1983, the longest of any performer.[28][29][30][31][32][33][34] Several attractions are decorated for the event including the Timber Mountain Log Ride and Calico Mine Train and there are 13 mazes of various themes. Elvira (actress Cassandra Peterson) was introduced into the Halloween Event in 1982 and was prominently featured in many Halloween Haunt events until 2001. According to postings on her My Space page, Cassandra was released from her contract by the park's new owners due to their wanting a more family friendly appeal,[35] although she returned for one night in 2012 for the 40th anniversary of the event and has returned as a regular performer throughout the run of the event for the last several years.[36] During the month of October, Knott's Scary Farm generates half the revenue for Knott's Berry Farm's fiscal year.[citation needed]\\r\\nSeason of Screams is a DVD produced by an independent company which traces the beginnings of Halloween Haunt and the story behind how it all got started back in 1973. Season of Screams also highlights recent Halloween Haunts.\\r\\nWinter Coaster Solace is an event that takes place in the first or second weekend of March every year when roller coaster enthusiasts can come before the park opens and stay after the park closes to ride the rides and eat at the Chicken Dinner Restaurant. It is intended to provide \\"solace\\" to visitors from other parts of the country where theme parks and roller coasters are seasonal, not year-round operations like the Southern California parks. Knott's Berry Farm also used to give attendees behind the scenes tours of the rides.\\r\\nEvery year since 1991, Knott's has offered free admission to veterans and their families during the month of November. Though this was originally started as a tribute to returning Gulf War veterans, they subsequently expanded it to include all veterans and have run it every year since.\\r\\nA Christmas event known as \\"Knott's Merry Farm\\" also happens annually. Previous Merry Farm events have included manufactured snow, handcrafts exhibits, and a visit with Santa Claus. This event was originally created by Gary Salisbury in the Fall of 1985.\\r\\nPraise (festival) has been a Christian themed celebration presented many years as a mix-in special event of music and comedy on New Year's Eve.\\r\\nThe park consists of five themed areas:\\r\\nCraftsmen in Ghost Town demonstrate the arts of the blacksmith, woodcarver, glass-blower, sign cutter, and spinner. Demonstrations of narrow gauge railroading and farm equipment hobbyists accompany additional merchant stalls of cottage-craft fairs seasonally at discounted admission which is restricted to Ghost Town only.\\r\\nWestern Trails Museum, relocated between the candy store and the General Store to accommodate Bigfoot Rapids, still features historical western artifacts large and small, from a hand powered horse-drawn fire engine to miniature replica of a borax hauling \\"Twenty Mule Team\\" and utensils necessary to survive the prairie and wilderness.\\r\\nThe Ghost Town area has a few other notable attractions. The Bird Cage Theatre only hosts two seasonal entertainmentsduring \\"Knott's Merry Farm,\\" two small productions of \\"The Gift of the Magi\\" and \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" and a Halloween Haunt thrill show. The Calico Stage, a large open-air stage in Calico Square, hosts a variety of shows and acts, big and small, from those of elementary school students, Gallagher, a local band, and the summer-spectacular All Wheels Extreme stunt show featuring youthful performers demonstrating aerial tricks with acrobatics, trampolines, and riding ramps with skates, scooters, skateboards, and freestyle bikes to popular music. Calico Saloon recreates the revelry of music, singing and dancing, with Cameo Kate hosting a variety of acts. Jersey Lily, Judge Roy Bean's combination courthouse/saloon, offers certified comical \\"genuine illegal hitchin'\\" alongside pickles, candy, and sports/soft drinks.\\r\\nMany parts of Ghost Town are forever lost to progress. The conversion of the Silver Dollar Saloon to a shooting gallery, Hunters Paradise shooting gallery to Panda Express and the original Berry Stand, moved several times with its last location now occupied by the Silver Bullet station.\\r\\nWhat is left of Ghost Town today was based on Calico ghost town and other real ghost towns in the Western United States such as Prescott, Arizona. Walter Knott inherited his uncle's silver mill and land, then bought more of the actual Calico ghost town in 1951 and developed it. In 1966, he donated that property to the corporate-municipal County of San Bernardino which then made the town of Calico, California into a public historic park, for which it charged an entrance/parking fee. See 'History?ÿ Ghost Town?ÿ Calico' section above.\\r\\nWild Water Wilderness is a section of Ghost Town that features two major rides: the Bigfoot Rapids river rafting adventure, and Pony Express, a horse themed family roller coaster installed in 2008. Nearby Bigfoot Rapids is Rapids Trader, a small merchandise stand. It is also home to Mystery Lodge, a multimedia show based on an Expo 86 pavilion featuring a Native American storyteller.\\r\\nFiesta Village was built in 1969 with a pop-culture Mexican theme. It was the second area constructed after the completion of Ghost Town. Stores like Casa California, restaurants like Pancho's Tacos, La Papa Loca, and La Victoria Cantina, games like Shoot If Yucan, and the themed rides like La Revoluci܇n, Jaguar!, and Montezooma's Revenge, along with the former attraction Tampico Tumbler, all contribute to the Mexican and Aztec theme of the area. In 2013 colorful string lights were added for the summer season.\\r\\nBoardwalk Games include physical challenges such as a rock wall, soccer, basketball and a rope ladder crawl. A variety of traditional pitch three balls and win a prize type games, such as squirt gun into clowns mouth, knock off milk bottles, pitch a quarter onto a plate are pitched by hawkers along the Boardwalk Games midway. In September 2012, Perilous Plunge closed for an expansion of the Boardwalk. Perilous Plunge was noticeably known as one of Knott's major thrill rides. The boardwalk reopened after a year transformation with two flat rides and a new family roller coaster taking the spot of Perilous Plunge. The Boomerang roller coaster also got repainted with a new vibrant green and yellow color scheme. The world's largest Johnny Rockets restaurant franchise is located at Knott's Boardwalk, featuring over 5,900 square feet (550?m2) of indoor dining space for more than 260 guests.\\r\\nCamp Snoopy is home to the park's family and children's rides, with many of the rides and attractions being built specifically for children and guests who cannot ride the park's more aggressive attractions. Its theme is Charles M. Schulz' \\"Peanuts\\" comic strip characters. Snoopy has been the mascot of Knott's Berry Farm since 1983, and the characters can now be seen at all of Cedar Fair's parks, except Gilroy Gardens, which is managed by Cedar Fair and owned by the city of Gilroy. The 14 rides include a mini roller coaster called the Timberline Twister, a mini-scrambler called the Log Peeler, a Zamperla Rockin' Tug called Lucy's Tugboat, and a steel spinning roller coaster called Sierra Sidewinder. Snoopy Bounce is a small attraction for kids. However, it is not considered a ride at the park. For guests who cannot ride the park's more aggressive and thrilled rides, Camp Snoopy contains a good number of rides for guests of all ages including infants, children, and seniors. With the exception of Sierra Sidewinder and Timberline Twister, the rides are relativity tame and not aggressive.\\r\\nKnott's Berry Farm also built the Mall of America's indoor theme park, which itself was originally called Camp Snoopy. (In fact, Charles M. Schulz hailed from St. Paul.) However, today the park is no longer affiliated with Knott's or Cedar Fair, and is now called Nickelodeon Universe.\\r\\nOn November 22, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced major improvements in the area of Camp Snoopy. Camp Snoopy will receive a makeover as the section is approaching its 30th anniversary. In summer 2014, Knott's Berry Farm will open up new rides in Camp Snoopy.[17]\\r\\nThe 2?ft (610?mm) narrow gauge[43] Grand Sierra Scenic Railroad takes guest on a four-minute train ride through the reflection lake. The ride was made shorter with the construction of Silver Bullet.\\r\\nLocated next to the Bottle House in Ghost Town, Indian Trails is a small area sandwiched between Camp Snoopy, Ghost Town, and Fiesta Village, showcasing Native American art, crafts, and dance. One ride is located in this area. It is called Butterfield Stagecoach which is a family ride where an actual stagecoach take guest on a circular ride through Fiesta Village and Camp Snoopy. It is one of the original rides at the park. The ride was developed directly by the park and it opened in 1949.\\r\\nMany of the original attractions are outside the gates of the current-day theme park along Grand Ave. at the California Marketplace, mostly things which would no longer be considered interesting to today's audience, or things which were merely there for decoration. Near the restrooms behind Berry Place are the waterfall overshooting the water wheel and historic gristmill grindstone, a replica of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate fireplace hearth, and what remains of the visible beehive. Some attractions still exist, but have been incorporated into backstage areas, such as the Rock Garden, now an employee smoking area. Other attractions have been removed, such as the historic volcano, and the cross-section of giant sequoia with age rings denoting historic events such as Christopher Columbus visiting America.\\r\\nThe east side of the property, divided by Beach Blvd., features the main parking lot, Knott's Soak City a seasonal water park that requires separate admission, the picnic grounds rental areas, complementary admission to Independence Hall and gift shop, and the Church of Reflections which was moved outside the theme park in 2004 and held non-denominational Sunday services until 2010, but is still used for wedding ceremonies. A tunnel and pedestrian underpass beneath Beach Blvd. connects the main parking lot to the shops, restaurants and theme park.\\r\\nFor Halloween Haunt in 2016, Knott's Berry Farm introduced FearVR: 5150, a virtual reality attraction that was met with controversy from the mental health community regarding the negative portrayal of mental illness.[46] The ten-minute-long attraction immersed guests inside of a chaotic mental hospital haunted by a supernatural central character named Katie and zombie-like patients.[47] The initial controversy came from the attraction's name, with 5150 referring to the California law that allows a law enforcement officer or clinician to involuntarily commit a person suspected of having a mental illness and determined \\"a danger to themselves or others\\". The backlash was focused on Cedar Fair's use of painful experiences suffered by those dealing with mental illness and to have it \\"transmogrified into spooky entertainment\\".[46] In response, Cedar Fair removed \\"5150\\" from the name, and after continued opposition, permanently closed the attraction on September 28, 2016, only six days after its debut.[48][49] A petition was signed by more than 2,000 people hoping Cedar Fair would bring it back, with the petition's organizer stating that Cedar Fair shouldn't be \\"forced to shut down an attraction based on the words of people who had not even experienced the attraction\\".[50]\\r\\nKnott's Soak City is Knott's Berry Farm's water park. It opened in 1999 as Soak City U.S.A. It requires separate admission from Knott's Berry Farm.\\r\\nFast Lane is Knott's Berry Farm's virtual queue system. For an extra fee, visitors get a wrist band that enables them to get to the front of the line on some of the most popular attractions without queuing.\\r\\nThe J.M. Smucker Company continues to sell the jam and preserves made famous by the Knott family; however, other products such as the syrups have been discontinued due to low demand.[51]\\r\\nIn November 2013, Knott's Berry Farm began selling their \\"Berry Market\\" brand of preserves at the park. The Berry Market brand is all-natural and uses the Knott family's original recipe. They are unable to use \\"Knott's\\" on the label, since Smucker's owns the rights to the name.\\r\\nKnott's Berry Farm can easily be accessed by public transportation. Service is available by both Los Angeles Metro and the Orange County Transportation Authority.[52] Bus routes serving the park include Metro Express Line 460 which provides direct express service between Downtown Los Angeles and Disneyland and OCTA bus routes 29 and 38.[53]","input":"When did knotts berry farm became an amusement park?"},{"output":"Massachusetts","context":"In the early 17th century, thousands of English Puritans settled in North America, mainly in New England. Puritans were generally members of the Church of England who believed that the Church of England was insufficiently reformed, retaining too much of its Roman Catholic doctrinal roots, and who therefore opposed royal ecclesiastical policy under Elizabeth I of England, James I of England, and Charles I of England. Most Puritans were \\"non-separating Puritans\\", meaning that they did not advocate setting up separate congregations distinct from the Church of England; a small minority of Puritans were \\"separating Puritans\\" who advocated setting up congregations outside the Church.  The Pilgrims were a Separatist group, and they established the Plymouth Colony in 1620. Non-separating Puritans played leading roles in establishing the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629, the Saybrook Colony in 1635, the Connecticut Colony in 1636, and the New Haven Colony in 1638. The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations was established by settlers expelled from the Massachusetts Bay Colony because of their unorthodox religious opinions. Puritans were also active in New Hampshire before it became a crown colony in 1691. \\r\\n\\r\\nMost Puritans who migrated to North America came in the decade 1630-1640 in what is known as the Great Migration. See the main articles on each of the colonies for information on their political and social history; this article focuses on the religious history of the Puritans in North America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Puritans of New England evolved into the Congregationalist churches.\\r\\n\\r\\nPuritanism was a Protestant movement that emerged in 16th-century England with the goal of transforming it into a godly society by reforming or purifying the Church of England of all remaining Roman Catholic teachings and practices.[1] During the reign of Elizabeth I, Puritans were for the most part tolerated within the established church. Like Puritans, most English Protestants at the time were Calvinist in their theology, and many bishops and Privy Council members were sympathetic to Puritan objectives. The major point of controversy between Puritans and church authorities was over liturgical ceremonies Puritans thought too Catholic, such as wearing clerical vestments, kneeling to receive Holy Communion, and making the sign of the cross during baptism.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the reign of James I, some Puritans were no longer willing to wait for further church reforms. These Separatists left the national church and began holding their own religious meetings, with many migrating to the Netherlands in order to escape persecution and worship freely. Nevertheless, most Puritans remained within the Church of England.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Charles I, Calvinist teachings were undermined and bishops became less tolerant of Puritan views and more willing to enforce the use of controversial ceremonies. New controls were placed on Puritan preaching, and some ministers were suspended or removed from their livings. Increasingly, many Puritans concluded that they had no choice but to emigrate.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1620, a group of Separatists known as the Pilgrims settled in New England and established the Plymouth Colony. The Pilgrims originated as a dissenting congregation in Scrooby led by William Brewster, Richard Clyfton and John Robinson. This congregation was subject to ecclesiastical investigation, and its members faced social hostility from conforming church members. Fearing increasing persecution, the group left England and settled in the Dutch city of Leiden. In 1620, after receiving a patent from the London Company, the Pilgrims left for New England on board the Mayflower, landing at Plymouth Rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo of the Pilgrim settlers in Plymouth Colony - Robert Cushman and Edward Winslow - believed that Cape Ann would be a profitable location for a settlement. They therefore organized a company which they named the Dorchester Company and in 1622 sailed to England seeking a patent from the London Company giving them permission to settle there. They were successful and were granted the Sheffield Patent (named after Edmond, Lord Sheffield, the member of the Plymouth Company who granted the patent). On the basis of this patent, Roger Conant led a group of fishermen to found Salem in 1626, being replaced as governor by John Endecott in 1627. \\r\\n\\r\\nOther Puritans were convinced that New England could provide a religious refuge, and the enterprise was reorganized as the Massachusetts Bay Company. In March 1629, it succeeded in obtaining from King Charles a royal charter for the establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1630, the first ships of the Great Puritan Migration sailed to the New World, led by John Winthrop.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the crossing, Winthrop preached a sermon entitled \\"A Model of Christian Charity\\", in which he told his followers that they had entered a covenant with God according to which he would cause them to prosper if they maintained their commitment to God. In doing so, their new colony would become a \\"City upon a Hill\\", meaning that they would be a model to all the nations of Europe as to what a properly reformed Christian commonwealth should look like.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the Puritans who emigrated settled in the New England area. However, the Great Migration of Puritans was relatively short-lived and not as large as is often believed. It began in earnest in 1629 with the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and ended in 1642 with the start of the English Civil War, when King Charles I effectively shut off emigration to the colonies. Emigration was officially restricted to conforming churchmen in December 1634 by his Privy Council.[7] From 1629 through 1643, approximately 21,000 Puritans immigrated to New England.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Migration of Puritans to New England was primarily an exodus of families. Between 1630 and 1640, over 13,000 men, women, and children sailed to Massachusetts. The religious and political factors behind the Great Migration influenced the demographics of the emigrants. Groups of young men seeking economic success predominated the Virginia colonies, whereas Puritan ships were laden with ordinary people, old and young, families as well as individuals. Just a quarter of the emigrants were in their twenties when they boarded ship in the 1630s, making young adults a minority in New England settlements. The New World Puritan population was more of a cross section in age of English population than those of other colonies. This meant that the Massachusetts Bay Colony retained a relatively normal population composition. In the colony of Virginia, the ratio of colonist men to women was 4:1 in early decades and at least 2:1 in later decades, and only limited intermarriage took place with Indian women. By contrast, nearly half of the Puritan immigrants to the New World were women, and there was very little intermarriage with Indians. The majority of families who traveled to Massachusetts Bay were families in progress, with parents who were not yet through with their reproductive years and whose continued fertility made New Englands population growth possible. The women who emigrated were critical agents in the success of the establishment and maintenance of the Puritan colonies in North America. Success in the early colonial economy depended largely on labor, which was conducted by members of Puritan families.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe struggle between the assertive Church of England and various Presbyterian and Puritan groups extended throughout the English realm in the 17th Century, prompting not only the re-emigration of British Protestants from Ireland to North America (the so-called Scotch-Irish), but prompting emigration from Bermuda, England's second-oldest overseas territory. Roughly 10,000 Bermudians emigrated before US Independence. Most of these went to the American colonies, founding, or contributing to settlements throughout the South, especially. Many had also gone to the Bahamas, where a number of Bermudian Independent Puritan families, under the leadership of William Sayle, had established the colony of Eleuthera in 1648.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Puritans also migrated to colonies in Central America and the Caribbean, see Providence Island Company, Mosquito Coast and Providencia Island.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmigration resumed under the rule of Cromwell, but not in large numbers as there was no longer any need to \\"escape persecution\\" in England. In fact, many Puritans returned to England during the war. \\"In 1641, when the English Civil War began, some immigrants returned to fight on the Puritan side, and when the Puritans won, many resumed English life under Oliver Cromwell's more congenial Puritan sway.\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce in New England, the Puritans established Congregational churches that subscribed to Reformed theology. The Savoy Declaration, a modification of the Westminster Confession of Faith, was adopted as a confessional statement by the churches in Massachusetts in 1680 and the churches of Connecticut in 1708.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cambridge Platform describes congregationalist polity as practiced by Puritans in the 17th century. Every congregation was founded upon a church covenant, a written agreement signed by all members in which they agreed to uphold congregational principles, to be guided by sola scriptura in their decision making, and to submit to church discipline. The right of each congregation to elect its own officers and manage its own affairs was upheld.[9][10] For church offices, Puritans imitated the model developed in Calvinist Geneva. There were two major offices: elder (or presbyter) and deacon. There were two types of elders. Ministers, whose responsibilities included preaching and administering the sacraments, were referred to as teaching elders. Large churches would have two ministers, one to serve as pastor and the other to serve as teacher. Prominent laymen would be elected for life as ruling elders. Ruling elders governed the church alongside teaching elders, and, while they could not administer the sacraments, they could preach. The duties of deacons largely revolved around financial matters. Other than elders and deacons, congregations also elected messengers to represent them in synods (church councils) for the purpose of offering non-binding advisory opinions.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe essential Puritan belief was that people are saved by grace alone and not by any merit from doing good works. At the same time, Puritans also believed that men and women \\"could labor to make themselves appropriate vessels of saving grace\\" [emphasis in original].[12] They could accomplish this through Bible reading, prayer and doing good works. This doctrine was called preparationism, and nearly all Puritans were preparationists to some extent.[12] The process of conversion was described in different ways, but most ministers agreed that there were three essential stages. The first stage was humiliation or sorrow for having sinned against God. The second stage was justification or adoption characterized by a sense of having been forgiven and accepted by God through Christ's mercy. The third stage was sanctification, the ability to live a holy life out of gladness toward God.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nPuritans believed churches should be composed of \\"visible saints\\" or the elect. To ensure that only regenerated persons were admitted as full members, New England churches required prospective members to provide a conversion narrative describing their personal conversion experience.[14] All settlers were required to attend church services and were subject to church discipline.[15] The Lord's Supper, however, was reserved to full members only.[14] Puritans practiced infant baptism, but only church members in full communion could present their children for baptism. Members' children were considered part of the church and covenant by birth and were entitled to baptism. Nevertheless, these children would not enjoy the full privileges of church membership until they provided a public account of conversion.[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nChurch services were held in the morning and afternoon on Sunday, and there was usually a mid-week service. The ruling elders and deacons sat facing the congregation on a raised seat.[18] Men and women sat on opposites sides of the meeting house, and children sat in their own section under the oversight of a tithingman, who corrected unruly children (or sleeping adults) with a long staff.[19] The pastor opened the service with prayer for about 15 minutes, the teacher then read and explained the selected Bible passage, and a ruling elder then led in singing a Psalm, usually from the Bay Psalm Book. The pastor then preached for an hour or more, and the teacher ended the service with prayer and benediction. In churches with only one minister, the morning sermon was devoted to the argument (interpreting the biblical text and justifying that interpretation) and the afternoon sermon to its application (the lessons that could be drawn from the text for the individual or for the collective community).[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Puritans, the family was the \\"locus of spiritual and civic development and protection\\",[22] and marriage was the foundation of the family and, therefore, society. Unlike in England, where people were married by ministers in church according to the Book of Common Prayer, Puritans saw no biblical justification for church weddings or the exchange of wedding rings. While marriage held great religious significance for Puritansthey saw it as a covenant relationship freely entered into by both man and wifethe wedding was viewed as a private, contractual event officiated by a civil magistrate either in the home of the magistrate or a member of the bridal party.[23] Massachusetts ministers were not legally permitted to solemnize marriages until 1686, after the colony had been placed under royal control, but by 1726 it had become the accepted tradition.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to scholars Gerald Moran and Maris Vinovskis, some historians argue that Puritan child-rearing was repressive. Central to this argument are the views of John Robinson, the Pilgrims' first pastor, who wrote in a 1625 treatise \\"Of Children and Their Education\\", \\"And surely there is in all children, though not alike, a stubborness, and stoutness of mind arising from natural pride, which must, in the first place, be broken and beaten down.\\"[25] Moran and Vinovskis, however, argue that Robinson's views were not representative of 17th-century Puritans. They write that Puritan parents \\"exercised an authoritative, not an authoritarian, mode of child rearing\\" that aimed to cultivate godly affections and reason, with corporal punishment used as a last resort.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to historian Bruce C. Daniels, the Puritans were \\"[o]ne of the most literate groups in the early modern world\\", with about 60 percent of New England able to read.[27] At a time when the literacy rate in England was less than 30 percent, the Puritan leaders of colonial New England believed children should be educated for both religious and civil reasons, and they worked to achieve universal literacy. In 1642, Massachusetts required heads of households to teach their wives, children and servants basic reading and writing so that they could read the Bible and understand colonial laws. In 1647, the government required all towns with 50 or more households to hire a teacher and towns of 100 or more households to hire a grammar school instructor to prepare promising boys for college. Boys interested in the ministry were often sent to colleges such as Harvard (founded in 1636) or Yale (founded in 1707).[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Puritans anticipated the educational theories of John Locke and other Enlightenment thinkers. Like Locke's blank slate, Puritans believed that a child's mind was \\"an empty receptacle, one that had to be infused with the knowledge gained from careful instruction and education.\\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nPuritans did not celebrate traditional holidays such as Christmas, Easter or May Day. They also did not observe personal annual holidays, such as birthdays or anniversaries. They did, however, celebrate special occasions such as military victories, harvests, ordinations, weddings and births. These celebrations consisted of food and conversation. Beyond special occasions, the tavern was an important place for people to gather for fellowship on a regular basis.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease Mather wrote that dancing was \\"a natural expression of joy; so that there is no more sin in it, than in laughter.\\" Puritans generally discouraged mixed or \\"promiscuous\\" dancing between men and women, which according to Mather would lead to \\"unchaste touches and gesticulations. .. [that] have a palpable tendency to that which is evil.\\" Some ministers, including John Cotton, thought that mixed dancing was appropriate under special circumstances, but all agreed it was a practice not to be encouraged. Dancing was also discouraged at weddings or on holidays (especially dancing around the Maypole) and was illegal in taverns.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nPuritans had no theological objections to sports and games as long as they did not involve gambling (which eliminated activities such as billiards, shuffleboard, horse racing, bowling and cards). They also opposed blood sports, such as cockfighting, cudgel-fighting and bear-baiting. Team sports, such as football, were problematic because \\"they encouraged idleness, produced injuries, and created bitter rivalries.\\" Hunting and fishing were approved because they were productive. Other sports were encouraged for promoting civic virtue, such as competitions of marksmanship, running, and wrestling held within militia companies.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly a few activities were completely condemned by Puritans. They were most opposed to the theater. According to historian Bruce Daniels, plays were seen as \\"false recreations because they exhausted rather than relaxed the audience and actors\\" and also \\"wasted labor, led to wantonness and homosexuality, and invariably were represented by Puritans as a foreignparticularly French or Italiandisease of a similar enervating nature as syphilis.\\"[31] All forms of gambling were illegal. Not only were card playing, dice throwing and other forms of gambling seen as contrary to the values of \\"family, work, and honesty\\", they were religiously offensive because gamblers implicitly asked God to intervene in trivial matters, violating the Third Commandment against taking the Lord's name in vain.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Puritans, the people of a society were bound together by a social covenant (such as Plymouth's Mayflower Compact, Connecticut's Fundamental Orders, New Haven's Fundamental Agreement, and Massachusetts' colonial charter). Having entered into such a covenant, eligible voters were responsible for choosing qualified men to govern and to obey such rulers, who ultimately received their authority from God and were responsible for using it to promote the common good. If the ruler was evil, however, the people were justified in opposing and rebelling against him. Such notions helped New Englanders justify the English Puritan Revolution of the 1640s, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the American Revolution of 1775.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Puritans also believed they were in a national covenant with God. They believed they were chosen by God to help redeem the world by their total obedience to his will. If they were true to the covenant, they would be blessed; if not, they would fail.[33]  Within this worldview, it was the government's responsibility to enforce moral standards and ensure true religious worship was established and maintained.[34] In the Puritan colonies, the Congregational church functioned as a state religion. In Massachusetts, no new church could be established without the permission of the colony's existing Congregational churches and the government.[35] Likewise, Connecticut allowed only one church per town or parish, which had to be Congregational.[36] All residents in Massachusetts and Connecticut were required to pay taxes for the support of the Congregational churches, even if they were religious dissenters.[37] The franchise was limited to Congregational church members in Massachusetts and New Haven, but voting rights were more extensive in Connecticut and Plymouth.[38][39] In Connecticut, church attendance on Sundays was mandatory (for both church members and non-members), and those who failed to attend were fined.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a greater separation of church and state in the Puritan commonwealths than existed anywhere in Europe at the time. In England, the king was head of both church and state, bishops sat in Parliament and the Privy Council, and church officials exercised many secular functions. In New England, secular matters were handled only by civil authorities, and those who held offices in the church were barred from holding positions in the civil government.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen dealing with unorthodox persons, Puritans believed that the church, as a spiritual organization, was limited to \\"attempting to persuade the individual of his error, to warn him of the dangers he faced if he publicly persisted in it, andas a last resortto expel him from the spiritual society by excommunication.\\"[42] Citizens who lost church membership by excommunication retained the right to vote in civil affairs.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Puritans did not come to America to establish a theocracy, but neither did they institute religious freedom.[44] Puritans believed that the state was obligated to protect society from heresy, and it was empowered to use corporal punishment, banishment and execution. New England magistrates did not investigate private views, but they did take action against public dissent from the religious establishment. Puritan sentiments were expressed by Nathaniel Ward in The Simple Cobbler of Agawam: \\"all Familists, Antinomians, Anabaptists, and other Enthusiasts shall have free Liberty to keep away from us, and such as will come [shall have liberty] to be gone as fast as they can, the sooner the better.\\"[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period 1658ÿ1692 saw the execution of Quakers and the imprisonment of Baptists.[45] Quakers were initially banished by colonial courts, but they often returned in defiance of authorities. Historian Daniel Boorstin stated, \\"the Puritans had not sought out the Quakers in order to punish them; the Quakers had come in quest of punishment.\\"[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoger Williams, a Separating Puritan minister, arrived in Boston in 1631. He was almost immediately invited to become the teacher at the Boston church, but he refused the invitation on the grounds that the congregation had not separated from the Church of England. He then was invited to become the teacher of the church at Salem but was blocked by Boston political leaders, who objected to his separatism. He thus spent two years with his fellow Separatists in the Plymouth Colony but ultimately came into conflict with them and returned to Salem, where he became the unofficial assistant pastor to Samuel Skelton.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliams held many controversial views that irritated the colony's political and religious leaders. He criticized the Puritan clergy's practice of meeting regularly for consultation, seeing in this a drift toward Presbyterianism.[47] William's concern for the purity of the church led him to oppose the mixing of the elect and the unregenerate for worship and prayer, even when the unregenerate were family members of the elect.[48] He also believed that Massachusetts rightfully belonged to the Native Americans and that the king had no authority to give it to the Puritans.[47] Because he feared that government interference in religion would corrupt the church, Williams rejected the government's authority to punish violations of the first four Ten Commandments and believed that magistrates should not tender oaths to unconverted persons, which would have effectively abolished civil oaths.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1634, Skelton died, and the Salem congregation called Williams to be its pastor.[47] In July 1635, however, he was brought before the General Court to answer for his views on oaths. Williams refused to back down, and the General Court warned Salem not to install him in any official position. In response, Williams decided that he could not maintain communion with the other churches in the colony nor with the Salem church unless they joined him in severing ties with the other churches.[48] Caught between Williams and the General Court, the Salem congregation rejected Williams's extreme views.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October, Williams was once again called before the General Court and refused to change his opinions. Williams was ordered to leave the colony and given until spring to do so, provided he ceased spreading his views. Unwilling to do so, the government issued orders for his immediate return to England in January 1636, but John Winthrop warned Williams, allowing him to escape.[49] In 1636, the exiled Williams founded the colony of Providence Plantation. He was one of the first Puritans to advocate separation of church and state, and Providence Plantation was one of the first places in the Christian world to recognize freedom of religion.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne Hutchinson and her family moved from Boston, Lincolnshire, to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634, following their Puritan minister John Cotton. Cotton became the teacher of the Boston church, working alongside its pastor John Wilson, and Hutchinson joined the congregation.[49] In 1635, Hutchinson began holding meetings in her home to summarize the previous week's sermons for women who had been absent. Such gatherings were not unusual.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1635, Wilson returned from a trip to England, and his preaching began to concern Hutchinson. Like most of the clergy in Massachusetts, Wilson taught preparationism, the belief that human actions were \\"a means of preparation for Gods grant of saving grace and?... evidence of sanctification.\\"[51] Cotton's preaching, however, emphasized the inevitability of God's will rather than human preparatory action. These two positions were a matter of emphases, as neither Cotton nor Wilson believed that good works could save a person. For Hutchinson, however, the difference was significant, and she began to criticize Wilson in her private meetings.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer of 1636, Hutchinson's meetings were attracting powerful men such as William Aspinwall, William Coddington, John Coggeshall, and the colony's governor, Henry Vane. The group's credibility was increased due to the perceived support of Cotton and the definite support of Hutchinson's brother-in-law, the minister John Wheelwright.[52]  By this time, Hutchinson was criticizing all the ministers in the colony, with the exception of Cotton and Wheelwright, for teaching legalism and preaching a \\"covenant of works\\" rather than a \\"covenant of grace\\".[53] While denouncing the Puritan clergy as Arminians, Hutchinson maintained \\"that assurance of salvation was conveyed not by action but by an essentially mystical experience of gracean inward conviction of the coming of the Spirit to the individual that bore no relationship to moral conduct.\\"[52] By rejecting adherence to the moral law, Hutchinson was teaching Antinomianism, according to her clerical opponents.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nTensions continued to increase in the Boston church between Wilson and Hutchinson's followers, who formed a majority of the members. In January 1637, they were nearly successful in censuring him, and in the months that followed, they left the meeting house whenever Wilson began to preach.[54] The General Court ordered a day of fasting and prayer to help calm tensions, but Wheelwright preached a sermon on that day that further inflamed tensions, for which he was found guilty of sedition. Because Governor Vane was one of Hutchinson's followers, the general election of 1637 became a battlefront in the controversy, and Winthrop was elected to replace Vane.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nA synod of New England clergy was held in August 1637. The ministers defined 82 errors attributed to Hutchinson and her followers. It also discouraged private religious meetings and criticizing the clergy. In November, Wheelwright was banished from the colony. Hutchinson herself was called before the General Court where she ably defended herself. Nevertheless, she was ultimately convicted and sentenced to banishment from the colony due in part to her claims of receiving direct personal revelations from God. Other supporters were disenfranchised or forbidden from bearing arms unless they admitted their errors.[55] Hutchinson received a church trial in March 1638 in which the Boston congregation switched sides and unanimously voted for Hutchinson's excommunication. This effectively ended the controversy.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile often described as a struggle for religious liberty, historian Francis Bremer states that this is a misunderstanding. Bremer writes, \\"Anne Hutchinson was every bit as intolerant as her enemies. The struggle was over which of two competing views would be crowned and enforced as New England orthodoxy. As a consequence of the crisis she precipitated, the range of views that were tolerated in the Bay actually narrowed.\\"[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the crisis, ministers realized the need for greater communication between churches and standardization of preaching. As a consequence, nonbinding ministerial conferences to discuss theological questions and address conflicts became more frequent in the following years.[57] A more substantial innovation was the implementation of the \\"third way of communion\\", a method of isolating a dissident or heretical church from neighboring churches. Members of an offending church would be unable to worship or receive the Lord's Supper in other churches.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs time passes and different perspectives arise within the scholarship of witchcraft and its involvement in Puritan New England, many scholars have stepped forth to contribute to what we know in regards to this subject. For instance, diverse perspectives involving the witch trials have been argued involving gender, race, economics, religion, and the social oppression that Puritans lived through that explain in a more in-depth way how Puritanism contributed to the trials and executions. Puritan fears, beliefs and institutions were the perfect storm that fueled the witch craze in towns such as Salem from an interdisciplinary and anthropological approach.[59] From a gendered approach, offered by Carol Karlsen and Elizabeth Reis, the question of why witches were primarily women did not fully surface until after the second wave of feminism in the 1980s. Some believe that women who were gaining economic or social power, specifically in the form of land inheritance, were at a higher risk of being tried as witches.[60] Others maintain that females were more susceptible to being witches as the Puritans believed that the weak body was a pathway to the soul which both God and the Devil fought for. Due to the Puritan belief that female bodies \\"lacked the strength and vitality\\" compared to male bodies, females were more susceptible to make a choice to enter a covenant with Satan as their fragile bodies could not protect their souls.[61] From a racial perspective, Puritans believed that African Americans and Native Americans living within the colonies were viewed as \\"true witches\\" from an anthropological sense as Blacks were considered \\"inherently evil creatures, unable to control their connection to Satanic wickedness.\\"[62] Another contribution made to scholarship includes the religious perspective that historians attempt to understand its effect on the witch trials. John Demos, a major scholar in the field of Puritan witchcraft studies, maintains that the intense and oppressive nature of Puritan religion can be viewed as the main culprit in the Colonial witch trials.[63] While many scholars provide different arguments to Puritanism and witchcraft, all of the various camps mentioned rely on each other in numerous ways in order to build on our understanding of the witch craze in early American History. As more perspectives from different scholars add to the knowledge of the Puritan involvement in the witch trials, a more complete picture and history will form.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe decline of the Puritans and the Congregational churches was brought about first through practices such as the Half-Way Covenant and second through the rise of dissenting Baptists, Quakers, Anglicans and Presbyterians in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no consensus on when the Puritan era ended, though it is agreed that it was over by 1740. Historian Thomas S. Kidd argues that after 1689 and the success of the Glorious Revolution, \\"[New Englanders'] religious and political agenda had so fundamentally changed that it doesn't make sense to call them Puritans any longer.\\"[65] Denominations that are directly descended from the Puritan churches of New England include the United Church of Christ, the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches, the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference and the Unitarian Universalist Association.","input":"Where were the pilgrims originally bound a. pennsylvania b. massachusetts c. virginia d. new york?"},{"output":"James Hargreaves","context":"The spinning jenny is a multi-spindle spinning frame, and was one of the key developments in the industrialization of weaving during the early Industrial Revolution. It was invented in 1764 by James Hargreaves in Stanhill, Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire in England. The device reduced the amount of work needed to produce cloth, with a worker able to work eight or more spools at once. This grew to 120 as technology advanced. The yarn produced by the jenny was not very strong until Richard Arkwright invented the water-powered 'Water Frame', which produced yarn harder and stronger than that of the initial spinning jenny. It started the factory system.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spinning jenny was invented by James Hargreaves. He was born in Oswaldtwistle, near Blackburn, around 1720. Blackburn was a town with a population of about 5,000, known for the production of \\"Blackburn greys,\\" cloths of linen warp and cotton weft initially imported from India. They were usually sent to London to be printed.\\r\\nAt the time, cotton production could not keep up with demand of the textile industry, and Hargreaves spent some time considering how to improve the process. The flying shuttle (John Kay 1733) had increased yarn demand by the weavers by doubling their productivity,[2] and now the spinning jenny could supply that demand by increasing the spinners' productivity even more. The machine produced coarse thread.\\r\\nThe idea was developed by Hargreaves as a metal frame with eight wooden spindles at one end. A set of eight rovings was attached to a beam on that frame. The rovings when extended passed through two horizontal bars of wood that could be clasped together. These bars could be drawn along the top of the frame by the spinner's left hand thus extending the thread. The spinner used his right hand to rapidly turn a wheel which caused all the spindles to revolve, and the thread to be spun. When the bars were returned, the thread wound onto the spindle. A pressing wire (faller) was used to guide the threads onto the right place on the spindle.[3]\\r\\nIn the 17th century, England was famous for its woollen and worsted cloth. That industry was centred in the east and south in towns such as Norwich which jealously protected their product. Cotton processing was tiny: in 1701 only 1,985,868 pounds (900,775?kg) of cotton-wool was imported into England, and by 1730 this had fallen to 1,545,472 pounds (701,014?kg). This was due to commercial legislation (Calico Acts) to protect the woollen industry.[4] Cheap calico prints, imported by the East India Company from \\"Hindustan\\", became popular. In 1700 an Act of Parliament was passed to prevent the importation of dyed or printed calicoes from India, China or Persia. This caused grey cloth (calico that hadn't been finished - dyed or printed) to be imported instead, and these were printed in southern England with popular patterns. Lancashire businessmen produced grey cloth with linen warp and cotton weft, which they sent to London to be finished.[4] Cotton-wool imports recovered and by 1720 were almost back to 1701 levels. Again the woollen manufacturers claimed this was taking jobs from workers in Coventry.[5] Another law was passed, to fine anyone caught wearing printed or stained calico; muslins, neckcloths and fustians were exempted. It was this exemption that the Lancashire manufacturers exploited.\\r\\nThe use of coloured cotton weft, with linen warp was permitted in the 1736 Manchester Act. There now was an artificial demand for woven cloth. In 1764, 3,870,392 pounds (1,755,580?kg) of cotton-wool was imported.[6]\\r\\nIn England, before canals, and before the turnpikes, the only way to transport goods such as calicos, broadcloth or cotton-wool was by packhorse. Strings of packhorses travelled along a network of bridle paths. A merchant would be away from home most of the year, carrying his takings in cash in his saddlebag. Later a series of chapmen would work for the merchant, taking wares to wholesalers and clients in other towns, with them would go sample books.[7]\\r\\nBefore 1720, the handloom weaver spent part of each day visiting neighbours buying any weft they had. Carding and spinning could be the only income for that household, or part of it. The family might farm a few acres and card, spin and weave wool and cotton.[8] It took three carders to provide the roving for one spinner, and up to three spinners to provide the yarn for one weaver. The process was continuous, and done by both sexes, from the youngest to the oldest. The weaver would go once a week to the market with his wares and offer them for sale.\\r\\nA change came about 1740 when fustian masters gave out raw cotton and warps to the weavers and returned to collect the finished cloth (L Putting-out system). The weaver organised the carding, spinning and weaving to the master's specification.[9] The master then dyed or printed the grey cloth, and took it to shopkeepers. Ten years later this had changed and the fustian masters were middle men, who collected the grey cloth and took it to market in Manchester where it was sold to merchants who organised the finishing.\\r\\nTo handweave a 12-pound (5.4?kg) piece of eighteenpenny weft took 14 days and paid 36 shillings in all. Of this nine shillings was paid for spinning, and nine for carding.[8] So by 1750, a rudimentary manufacturing system feeding into a marketing system emerged.\\r\\nIn 1738 John Kay started to improve the loom. He improved the reed, and invented the raceboard, the shuttleboxes and the picker which together allowed one weaver to double his output. This invention is commonly called the fly-shuttle. It met with violent opposition and he fled from Lancashire to Leeds.[10] Though the workers thought this was a threat to their jobs, it was adopted and the pressure was on to speed up carding and spinning.\\r\\nThe shortage of spinning capacity to feed the more efficient looms provided the motivation to develop more productive spinning techniques such as the spinning jenny, and triggered the start of the Industrial Revolution.\\r\\nHargreaves kept the machine secret for some time, but produced a number for his own growing industry. The price of yarn fell, angering the large spinning community in Blackburn. Eventually they broke into his house and smashed his machines, forcing him to flee to Nottingham in 1768. This was a centre for the hosiery industry, and knitted silks, cottons and wool. There he set up shop producing jennies in secret for one Mr Shipley, with the assistance of a joiner named Thomas James. He and James set up a textile business in Mill Street. On 12 July 1770, he took out a patent (no. 962) on his invention, the Spinning Jennya machine for spinning, drawing and twisting cotton.[11] [12] By this time a number of spinners in Lancashire were using copies of the machine, and Hargreaves sent notice that he was taking legal action against them. The manufacturers met, and offered Hargreaves S3,000. He at first demanded S7,000, and stood out for S4,000, but the case eventually fell apart when it was learned he had sold several in the past.[13]\\r\\nThe spinning jenny succeeded because it held more than one ball of yarn, making more yarn in a shorter time and reducing the overall cost. The spinning jenny would not have been such a success if the flying shuttle had not been invented and installed in textile factories. Its success was limited in that it required the rovings to be prepared on a wheel, and this was limited by the need to card by hand.[1] It continued in common use in the cotton and fustian industry until about 1810.[14] The spinning jenny was superseded by the spinning mule. The jenny was adapted for the process of slubbing, being the basis of the Slubbing Billy.[15]\\r\\nThe most common story told about the invention of the device and the origin of the Jenny in the machine's name is that a daughter (or his wife) named Jenny knocked over one of their own spinning wheels. The device kept working as normal, with the spindle now pointed upright. Hargreaves realized there was no particular reason the spindles had to be horizontal, as they always had been, and he could place them vertically in a row.[16]\\r\\nThe name is variously said to derive from this tale. The Registers of Church Kirk show that Hargreaves had several daughters, but none named Jenny (neither was his wife). A more likely explanation of the name is that 'Jenny' was an abbreviation of 'engine'.[17]\\r\\nThomas Highs of Leigh has claimed to be the inventor[18] and the story is repeated using his wife's name.\\r\\nAnother myth has Thomas Earnshaw inventing a spinning device of a similar description - but destroying it after fearing he might be taking bread out of the mouths of the poor.[19]","input":"Who is the inventor of the spinning jenny?"},{"output":"in 1993","context":"The MGM Grand Las Vegas (formerly Marina and MGM-Marina) is a hotel and casino located on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada.

Instead, the MGM Grand is linked by overhead pedestrian bridges to its neighboring casinos: to the south across Tropicana Avenue, the Tropicana, and to the west across the Strip, New York-New York.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe property was originally the site of the Golf Club Motel during the 1960s.[3] In 1972, Tom Wiesner co-founded Southwest Securities Development Company, and later founded Wiesner Investment Company.[4] In November 1973, Southwest Securities Development was planning the Airport Marina Hotel, to be built at the site of the 170-room Golf Club Motel, which was located near McCarran International Airport. Southwest planned to renovate the motel structure and add a 14-story addition with 518 rooms. Fred Harvey Company would serve as the operator of the hotel, its restaurants, and other areas of the resort. Fred Harvey had previously opened hotels in other parts of the United States under the Airport Marina name. Southwest also planned to construct a 28,400?sq?ft (2,640?m2) casino that would operate separately from Fred Harvey.[5]\\r\\nThe 700-room Marina, located at 3805 South Las Vegas Boulevard, was built by Wiesner Investment Company and was opened in 1975.[4][6] In 1989, Wiesner and his partners sold the Marina to Kirk Kerkorian,[7] who also bought the Tropicana Country Club, located behind the Marina and across Tropicana Avenue from the Tropicana and San Rmo hotels to obtain the site that would become the home of the MGM Grand. Kerkorian saw the Marina as a stable and solidly built resort, and decided not to destroy the hotel, but to build around it.[8] During that time, the Marina was known as the MGM-Marina Hotel.[9][10][11]\\r\\nThe Marina closed on November 30, 1990, and ground was broken for the new casino hotel complex on October 7, 1991. The Marina hotel building still exists as the west wing of the main hotel building.[9][10]\\r\\nWhen the latest MGM Grand opened on December 18, 1993, it was owned by MGM Grand Inc. At that time it had an extensive Wizard of Oz theme, including the green \\"Emerald City\\" color of the building and the decorative use of Wizard of Oz memorabilia. After entering the casino's main entrance, one would find themselves in the Oz Casino facing Emerald City. Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion were seen in front of the city. The Emerald City attraction featured an elaborate yellow brick road walk-through, complete with the cornfield, apple orchard, and haunted forest, as well as audio-animatronic figures of Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Wicked Witch of the West. It would end at the door of the city, leading inside for a performance of \\"The Wizard's Secrets\\". When MGM Grand began its extensive refurbishment in 1996, the Oz Casino was the first to go. The Emerald City was completely demolished, and the Emerald City Gift Shop was moved to a new shopping section of the casino. The store remained open until early 2003.\\r\\nOriginally, the main entrance on the Strip was under the head of a giant cartoon-like version of MGM's logo, Leo the Lion, but this entrance feature was changed to a more traditional entrance. In 1998, a large bronze statue of Leo was added above the entrance to keep with the MGM Lion theme, while not scaring away guests. The statue weighs 50 tons, and at 45 feet (14?m) tall, on a 25-foot pedestal, is the largest bronze statue in the U.S.[12]\\r\\nWhen the MGM Grand opened, the intention was to create the first true destination hotel in the Las Vegas area by including the MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park behind the casino. The plan was to make the Las Vegas Strip more family friendly by providing activities for those too young to linger inside the casino. The theme park performed poorly and did not reopen for the 2001 season. On December 5, 2002, MGM Resorts International (then named MGM Mirage) announced that the former theme park would be developed as a luxury condominium and hotel complex called The Signature at MGM Grand.\\r\\nThe Las Vegas Monorail was built to connect MGM Grand to Bally's in 1995. The coming-out party for the monorail, on behalf of Bally's, consisted of showgirls and guys from Bally's famed show, Jubilee!, helping groups to the monorail. Characters from the Wizard of Oz greeted the groups on the MGM side. The track was later updated to become the southernmost section of the Las Vegas Monorail. The MGM Grand station was refurbished, the trains were replaced with Bombardier M-VI's, and the track was extended beyond the southern station to provide for track switching for the trains, as well as a starting point for a potential future southern extension to the monorail line.\\r\\nIn 2000, in an attempt to appeal to a more \\"mature\\" clientele, the hotel underwent a major renovation, and almost all traces of the Oz theme were removed. The theme is now more of the Art Deco era of classic Hollywood, and the hotel started billing itself as The City of Entertainment. More recently, the resort has used the phrase \\"Maximum Vegas\\", referring to the vast amount of activities MGM Grand offers its guests.\\r\\nOn April 26, 2000, MGM opened a new satellite registration/hotel check-in center at McCarran International Airport. This was the first of its kind opened by a hotel company at any United States airport.[13] However, this airport check-in center appears to have closed in late 2013.\\r\\nIn 2005, MGM opened the West Wing, a renovation of the original Marina Hotel rooms.\\r\\nIn October 2011, MGM began a renovation in which all of its rooms and suites in the main tower were fully renovated, along with the casino floor and other public areas.

Before Indian independence in 1947, the southern half of the reserve was under control of the British in India while the northern half was controlled by the rulers of the princely State of Hyderabad, who maintained it as a hunting reserve for royalty and their guests.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1983 there were 40 tigers in the reserve. The habitat suffered severely due to high frequency of poaching, grazing, fires and exploitation of trees and bamboo. Improvements in water resources, check dams, artificial troughs, new fire lines, salt licks and better protection has helped restore the habitat. In 1989 the tiger numbers were put at 94 an increase of 130% in 6 years. There was no other census till 1993 due to extremist interference in the area.present population of tigers by September 2016 is 110.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main types of forest biomes in the reserve are: southern tropical dry mixed deciduous forest, Hardwickia forest and Deccan thorn scrub forests with much Euphorbia scrub.  Important plant species here are: Anogeissus latifolia (axlewood), Cleisthanthus collinus (odcha), Terminalia spp., Pterocarpus marsupium, Hardwickia binata (anjan tree), Boswellia serrata (Indian frankincense or salai), Tectona grandis (teak), Mundulea sericea and Albizia spp. (silkplants).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main mammals in the reserve are: Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, sloth bear, Ussuri dhole, Indian pangolin, chital, sambar deer, chevrotain, blackbuck, chinkara and chowsingha. Lesser fauna include mugger crocodile, Indian python, Naja naja, Ptyas mucosa, Bengal monitor, Indian Star tortoise and Indian peafowl.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presence of armed extremists in this forest is a serious problem to the effective management of this area and the tigers. The subordinate staff are scared to move freely in the interior and little communication exists. The forest is an oasis for five surrounding districts and meets their demand for timber and fuel. The smugglers operate in the interior areas and move timber to the plains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a considerable grazing pressure on the fringe areas, that also affects the core. If not contained this pressure can make serious inroads into the core.\\r\\n\\r\\nAttacks by tigers on cattle and humans are a problem that require solutions, and it all concerns the pressures on this natural resource.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 200 villages are situated in and around the reserve of which 120 villages are within the sanctuary limits. There are 24 villages in the core area of the reserve, comprising 557 families with a population of 2,285 mostly Chenchu people. 8,432 families with a population of 43,978 live within the sanctuary limits outside the core. \\r\\n80 villages with 24,531 families consisting of 122,751 people live in the fringe areas. The overall population density of the reserve is 0.2 persons per km2. The population grew at the rate of 1.3 per cent over the inter-census period 1981-1991.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are about 15,000 domestic animals in the villages in the core area. The annual growth is around 400. Livestock population in non-core part of the reserve is 43,350. Around 300,000 migratory cattle enter into the reserve from the plains, immediately after the onset of monsoons.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne village has been relocated in 10 years. Efforts to relocate other villagers have been made but it is felt that these Chenchu tribals could also co-exist with the natural system since their needs are basic and simple. In this situation it is better to work with the people to protect the forest. There is a village on the Srisailam highway that is expanding into agriculture, and serious attention should be given to its relocation in the future, before major encroachments are made into the forest.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdministratively this Project Tiger circle has staff drawn from 5 adjoining districts and under prevailing rules they have to be posted in the area of their districts. If management strategies are to be strengthened all the buffer area must be in the control of the field director. The forest staff face serious obstacles due to the presence of extremists in the day-to-day management of the area and it is to their credit that they have managed to shoulder their work with courage. Low herbivore populations and the question of cattle lifting by tigers needs to be researched, and a detailed analysis of the prey base is essential.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe future plans of the park management include: water resources development, welfare measure for people, pasture plantations, bio-gas plants, solar pump sets, smokeless chullahs have been organised to some extent but much more is required through the offices of Project Tiger. Boats, jeeps and wireless networks are required to deal with smugglers and extremists. More pasture lands need to be created and a restocking of the denuded and depleted hill slopes is needed. \\r\\nFire fighting squads need to be increased.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park has an environmental educational centre that is functioning and will be enhanced further to increase an awareness to nature. Unless extremist activity is brought under control, serious management and research in this the largest Project Tiger reserve will suffer tremendously. So far no research project has taken place and without serious information the problems will not find solutions.[4]","input":"Which is the largest tiger reserve in india?"},{"output":"January 1, 1994","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA; Spanish: Tratado de Libre Comercio de Amrica del Norte, TLCAN; French: Accord de libre-change nord-amricain, ALNA) is an agreement signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, creating a trilateral trade bloc in North America. The agreement came into force on January 1, 1994.[4] It superseded the CanadaÿUnited States Free Trade Agreement between the U.S. and Canada.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nNAFTA has two supplements: the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) and the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC).\\r\\n\\r\\nMost economic analyses indicate that NAFTA has been beneficial to the North American economies and the average citizen,[6][7][8] but harmed a small minority of workers in industries exposed to trade competition.[9][10] Economists hold that withdrawing from NAFTA or renegotiating NAFTA in a way that reestablishes trade barriers will adversely affect the U.S. economy and cost jobs.[11][12][13] However, Mexico would be much more severely affected by job loss and reduction of economic growth in both the short term and long term.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe impetus for a North American free trade zone began with U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who made the idea part of his campaign when he announced his candidacy for the presidency in November 1979.[15] Canada and the United States signed the CanadaÿUnited States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in 1988, and shortly afterward Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari decided to approach US president George H. W. Bush to propose a similar agreement in an effort to bring in foreign investment following the Latin American debt crisis.[15] As the two leaders began negotiating, the Canadian government under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney feared that the advantages Canada had gained through the CanadaÿUS FTA would be undermined by a USÿMexican bilateral agreement, and asked to become a party to the USÿMexican talks.[16]  Following diplomatic negotiations dating back to 1990 among the three nations, the three leaders signed the agreement in their respective capitals on December 17, 1992.[17] The signed agreement then  needed to be ratified by each nation's legislative or parliamentary branch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earlier CanadaÿUnited States Free Trade Agreement had been  controversial and divisive in Canada, and featured as an issue in the 1988 Canadian election. In that election, more Canadians voted for anti-free trade parties (the Liberals and the New Democrats) but the split of the votes between the two parties meant that the pro-free trade Progressive Conservatives (PCs) came out of the election with the most seats and so took power. Mulroney and the PCs had a parliamentary majority easily passed the 1987 CanadaÿUS FTA and NAFTA bills. However, Mulroney was replaced as Conservative leader and prime minister by Kim Campbell.  Campbell led the PC party into the 1993 election where they were decimated by the Liberal Party under Jean Chrtien, who campaigned on a promise to renegotiate or abrogate NAFTA. Chrtien subsequently negotiated two supplemental agreements with Bush, who had subverted the LAC[18] advisory process[19] and worked to \\"fast track\\" the signing prior to the end of his term, ran out of time and had to pass the required ratification and signing of the implementation law to incoming president Bill Clinton.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore sending it to the United States Senate Clinton added two side agreements, the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC) and the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC), to protect workers and the environment, and also allay the concerns of many House members. They also required U.S. partners to adhere to environmental practices and regulations similar to its own.[citation needed] After much consideration and emotional discussion, the US House of Representatives passed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act on November 17, 1993, 234ÿ200. The agreement's supporters included 132 Republicans and 102 Democrats. The bill passed the Senate on November 20, 1993, 61ÿ38.[21] Senate supporters were 34 Republicans and 27 Democrats. Clinton signed it into law on December 8, 1993; the agreement went into effect on January 1, 1994.[22][23] Clinton, while signing the NAFTA bill, stated that \\"NAFTA means jobs. American jobs, and good-paying American jobs. If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't support this agreement.\\"[24]  NAFTA then replaced the previous Canada-US FTA.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal of NAFTA was to eliminate barriers to trade and investment between the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The implementation of NAFTA on January 1, 1994, brought the immediate elimination of tariffs on more than one-half of Mexico's exports to the U.S. and more than one-third of U.S. exports to Mexico. Within 10 years of the implementation of the agreement, all U.S.ÿMexico tariffs were to be eliminated except for some U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico to be phased out within 15 years.[25] Most U.S.ÿCanada trade was already duty-free. NAFTA also sought to eliminate non-tariff trade barriers and to protect the intellectual property rights on traded products.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 52 provides a procedure for the international resolution of disputes over the application and interpretation of NAFTA. It was modeled after Chapter 69 of the CanadaÿUnited States Free Trade Agreement.[26]  The roster of NAFTA adjudicators includes many retired judges, such as Alice Desjardins, John Maxwell Evans, Constance Hunt, John Richard, Arlin M. Adams, Susan Getzendanner, George C. Pratt, Charles B. Renfrew and Sandra Day O'Connor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NAFTA is, in part, implemented by Technical Working Groups, which are composed of government officials from each of the three partners.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act made some changes to the copyright law of the United States, foreshadowing the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994 by restoring copyright (within the NAFTA nations) on certain motion pictures which had entered the public domain.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. congressional approval for NAFTA would have been impossible without addressing public concerns about NAFTA's environmental impact.[30] The Clinton administration negotiated a side agreement on the environment with Canada and Mexico, the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC), which led to the creation of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) in 1994. To alleviate concerns that NAFTA, the first regional trade agreement between a developing country and two developed countries, would have negative environmental impacts, the commission was mandated to conduct ongoing ex post environmental assessment,[31] It created one of the first ex post frameworks for environmental assessment of trade liberalization, designed to produce a body of evidence with respect to the initial hypotheses about NAFTA and the environment, such as the concern that NAFTA would create a \\"race to the bottom\\" in environmental regulation among the three countries, or that NAFTA would pressure governments to increase their environmental protections.[32] The CEC has held[when?] four symposia to evaluate the environmental impacts of NAFTA and commissioned 47 papers on the subject from leading independent experts.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the earliest negotiation, agriculture was (and still is) a controversial topic within NAFTA, as it has been with almost all free trade agreements signed within the WTO framework. Agriculture is the only section that was not negotiated trilaterally; instead, three separate agreements were signed between each pair of parties. The CanadaÿU.S. agreement contains significant restrictions and tariff quotas on agricultural products (mainly sugar, dairy, and poultry products), whereas the MexicoÿU.S. pact allows for a wider liberalization within a framework of phase-out periods (it was the first NorthÿSouth FTA on agriculture to be signed).[clarification needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNAFTA established the CANAMEX Corridor for road transport between Canada and Mexico, also proposed for use by rail, pipeline, and fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure. This became a High Priority Corridor under the U.S. Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 2008 alone, Canadian exports to the United States and Mexico were at $381.3 billion, with imports at $245.1 billion.[34] According to University of Toronto economist Daniel Trefler,  NAFTA produced a significant net benefit to Canada, with long-term productivity increasing by up to 15 percent in industries that experienced the deepest tariff cuts.[35] While the contraction of low-productivity plants reduced employment (up to 12 percent of existing positions), these job losses lasted less than a decade; overall, unemployment in Canada has fallen since the passage of the act. Commenting on this trade-off, Trefler said that the critical question in trade policy is to understand \\"how freer trade can be implemented in an industrialized economy in a way that recognizes both the long-run gains and the short-term adjustment costs borne by workers and others\\".[36] Another of NAFTA's biggest economic effects on U.S.ÿCanada trade has been higher bilateral agricultural flows.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nA study in 2007 found that NAFTA had \\"a substantial impact on international trade volumes, but a modest effect on prices and welfare\\".[38] A 2015 study that focused on the impact of NAFTA's tariff reductions found that while intra-bloc trade increased by 41% for the U.S. and 118% for Mexico, it increased by a modest 11% for Canada. Moreover, the US and Mexico benefited more from the tariff reductions component, with welfare increases of 0.08% and 1.31%, respectively, with Canada experiencing a decrease of 0.06%.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaquiladoras (Mexican assembly plants that take in imported components and produce goods for export) have become the landmark of trade in Mexico. They moved to Mexico from the United States[citation needed], hence the debate over the loss of American jobs. Income in the maquiladora sector has increased 15.5% since the implementation of NAFTA in 1994.[40] Other sectors now benefit from the free trade agreement, and the share of exports to the US from non-border states has increased in the last five years[when?] while the share of exports from border states has decreased. This has allowed rapid growth in non-border metropolitan areas such as Toluca, Le܇n and Puebla; all larger in population than Tijuana, Ciudad Jurez, and Reynosa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe overall effect of the MexicoÿU.S. agricultural agreement is disputed. Mexico did not invest in the infrastructure necessary for competition, such as efficient railroads and highways.This resulted in more difficult living conditions for the country's poor. Mexico's agricultural exports increased 9.4 percent annually between 1994 and 2001, while imports increased by only 6.9 percent a year during the same period.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most affected agricultural sectors is the meat industry. Mexico went from a small player in the pre-1994 U.S. export market to the second largest importer of U.S. agricultural products in 2004, and NAFTA may be a major catalyst for this change. Free trade removed the hurdles that impeded business between the two countries, so Mexico has provided a growing market for meat for the U.S., and increased sales and profits for the U.S. meat industry. A coinciding noticeable increase in the Mexican per capita GDP greatly changed meat consumption patterns; per capita meat consumption has grown.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction of corn in Mexico has increased since NAFTA. But internal demand for corn has increased beyond Mexico's supply, and imports have become needed, far beyond the quotas Mexico originally negotiated.[43] Zahniser & Coyle also point out that corn prices in Mexico, adjusted for international prices, have drastically decreased, but through a program of subsidies expanded by former president Vicente Fox, production has remained stable since 2000.[44] Reducing agricultural subsidies, especially corn subsidies, has been suggested as a way to reduce harm to Mexican farmers.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2001 Journal of Economic Perspectives review of the existing literature found that NAFTA was a net benefit to Mexico.[8] By the year 2003, 80% of the commerce in Mexico was executed only with the U.S. The commercial sales surplus, combined with the deficit with the rest of the world, created a dependency in Mexico's exports. These effects were evident in 2001ÿ2003; the result of that recession was either a low rate or a negative rate in Mexico's exports.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2015 study found that Mexico's welfare increased by 1.31% as a result of the NAFTA tariff reductions, and that Mexico's intra-bloc trade increased by 118%.[39] Inequality and poverty fell in the most globalization-affected regions of Mexico.[47] 2013 and 2015 studies show that Mexican small farmers benefitted more from NAFTA than large-scale farmers.[48][49]\\r\\n\\r\\nNAFTA has also been credited with the rise of the Mexican middle class. A Tufts University study found that NAFTA lowered the average cost of basic necessities in Mexico by up to 50%.[50] This price reduction increased cash-on-hand for many Mexican families, allowing Mexico to graduate more engineers than Germany each year.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowth in new sales orders indicates an increase in demand for manufactured products, which resulted in expansion of production and a higher employment rate to satisfy the increment in the demand. The growth in the maquiladora industry and in the manufacturing industry was of 4.7% in August  2016.[52] Three quarters of the imports and exports comes are with the U.S.\\r\\n\\r\\nTufts University political scientist Daniel W. Drezner has argued that NAFTA made it easier for Mexico to transform to a real democracy and become a country that views itself as North American. This has boosted cooperation between the United States and Mexico.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomists consider that NAFTA was beneficial for the United States.[54][55] In a 2012 survey of leading economists, 95% said that on average U.S. citizens benefited from NAFTA.[7] A 2001 Journal of Economic Perspectives review found that NAFTA was a net benefit to the United States.[8] A 2015 study found that US welfare increased by 0.08% as a result of NAFTA tariff reductions, and that US intra-bloc trade increased by 41%.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, the Congressional Research Service concluded that the \\"net overall effect of NAFTA on the US economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of US GDP. However, there were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment among their economies.\\" The report also estimated that NAFTA added $80 billion to the US economy since its implementation, equivalent to a 0.5% increase in US GDP.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US Chamber of Commerce credits NAFTA with increasing U.S. trade in goods and services with Canada and Mexico from $337 billion in 1993 to $1.2 trillion in 2011, while the AFLÿCIO blames the agreement for sending 700,000 American manufacturing jobs to Mexico over that time.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nUniversity of California, San Diego economics professor Gordon Hanson has said that NAFTA helped the US compete against China and therefore saved US jobs.[58][59] While some jobs were lost to Mexico as a result of NAFTA, considerably more would have been lost to China if not for NAFTA.[58][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US had a trade surplus with NAFTA countries of $28.3 billion for services in 2009 and a trade deficit of $94.6 billion (36.4% annual increase) for goods in 2010.  This trade deficit accounted for 26.8% of all US goods trade deficit.[60] A 2018 study of global trade published by the Center for International Relations identified irregularities in the patterns of trade of NAFTA ecosystem using network theory analytical techniques. The study showed that the US trade balance is influenced by tax avoidance opportunities provided in Ireland[61].\\r\\n\\r\\nA study published in the August 2008 issue of the American Journal of Agricultural Economics, found NAFTA increased US agricultural exports to Mexico and Canada, even though most of the increase occurred a decade after its ratification. The study focused on the effects that gradual \\"phase-in\\" periods in regional trade agreements, including NAFTA, have on trade flows. Most of the increase in members' agricultural trade, which was only recently brought under the purview of the World Trade Organization, was due to very high trade barriers before NAFTA or other regional trade agreements.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in NAFTA countries (stock) was $327.5 billion in 2009 (latest data available)[when?], up 8.8% from 2008.[60] The US direct investment in NAFTA countries is in nonbank holding companies, and in the manufacturing, finance/insurance, and mining sectors.[60]  The foreign direct investment of Canada and Mexico in the United States (stock) was $237.2 billion in 2009 (the latest data available), up 16.5% from 2008.[60][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economic impacts of NAFTA on the U.S. economy have been modest. In a 2015 report, the Congressional Research Service summarized multiple studies as follows: \\"In reality, NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters. The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP. However, there were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment among their economies.\\"[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany American small businesses depend on exporting their products to Canada or Mexico under NAFTA.  According to the U.S. Trade Representative, this trade supports over 140,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in the US.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, California, Texas, Michigan and other states with high concentrations of manufacturing jobs were most affected by job loss due to NAFTA.[66] EPI economist Robert Scott estimates some 682,900 U.S. jobs have been \\"lost or displaced\\" as a result of the trade agreement.[67] However, other studies have found that NAFTA only had a modest impact on manufacturing employment, and that automation explains 87% of the losses in manufacturing jobs.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to University of California Berkeley professor of economics Brad DeLong, NAFTA had an insignificant impact on US manufacturing.[69] The adverse impact on manufacturing has been very exaggerated in US political discourse according to DeLong,[69] Harvard economist Dani Rodrik agrees.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a study in the Journal of International Economics, NAFTA reduced pollution emitted by the US manufacturing sector: \\"On average, nearly two-thirds of the reductions in PM10[clarification needed] and SO2[clarification needed] emissions from the U.S. manufacturing sector between 1994 and 1998 can be attributed to trade liberalization following NAFTA.\\"[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Sierra Club, NAFTA contributed to large-scale, export-oriented farming, which led to the increased use of fossil fuels, pesticides and GMO.[72] NAFTA also contributed to environmentally destructive mining practices in Mexico.[72] It prevented Canada from effectively regulating its tar sands industry, and created new legal avenues for transnational corporations to fight environmental legislation.[72] In some cases, environmental policy was neglected in the wake of trade liberalization; in other cases, NAFTA's measures for investment protection, such as Chapter 11, and measures against non-tariff trade barriers threatened to discourage more vigorous environmental policy.[73] The most serious overall increases in pollution due to NAFTA were found in the base metals sector, the Mexican petroleum sector, and the transportation equipment sector in the United States and Mexico, but not in Canada.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, during fiscal year 2006 (i.e., October 2005 through September 2006), 73,880 foreign professionals (64,633 Canadians and 9,247 Mexicans) were admitted into the United States for temporary employment under NAFTA (i.e., in the TN status). Additionally, 17,321 of their family members (13,136 Canadians, 2,904 Mexicans, as well as a number of third-country nationals married to Canadians and Mexicans) entered the U.S. in the treaty national's dependent (TD) status.[75] Because DHS counts the number of the new I-94 arrival records filled at the border, and the TN-1 admission is valid for three years, the number of non-immigrants in TN status present in the U.S. at the end of the fiscal year is approximately equal to the number of admissions during the year. (A discrepancy may be caused by some TN entrants leaving the country or changing status before their three-year admission period has expired, while other immigrants admitted earlier may change their status to TN or TD, or extend TN status granted earlier).\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the International Organization for Migration, deaths of migrants have been on the rise worldwide with 5,604 deaths in 2016.[76] An increased number of undocumented farmworkers in California may be due to the initial passing of NAFTA[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian authorities estimated that on December 1, 2006,  24,830 U.S. citizens and 15,219 Mexican citizens were in Canada as \\"foreign workers\\". These numbers include both entrants under  NAFTA and those who entered under other provisions of Canadian immigration law.[78] New entries of foreign workers in 2006 totalled 16,841 U.S. citizens and 13,933 Mexicans.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second 1992 presidential debate, Ross Perot argued:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have got to stop sending jobs overseas. It's pretty simple: If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers and you can move your factory south of the border, pay a dollar an hour for labor,?... have no health carethat's the most expensive single element in making a carhave no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement, and you don't care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south.\\r\\n\\r\\n... when [Mexico's] jobs come up from a dollar an hour to six dollars an hour, and ours go down to six dollars an hour, and then it's leveled again. But in the meantime, you've wrecked the country with these kinds of deals.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nPerot ultimately lost the election, and the winner, Bill Clinton, supported NAFTA, which went into effect on January 1, 1994.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, the gasoline additive MMT was brought to Canada by Ethyl Corporation, an American company when the Canadian federal government banned imports of the additive. The American company brought a claim under NAFTA Chapter 11 seeking US$201 million,[81] from the Canadian federal government as well as the Canadian provinces under the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT). They argued that the additive had not been conclusively linked to any health dangers, and that the prohibition was damaging to their company. Following a finding that the ban was a violation of the AIT,[82] the Canadian federal government repealed the ban and settled with the American company for US$13 million.[83] Studies by Health and Welfare Canada (now Health Canada) on the health effects of MMT in fuel found no significant health effects associated with exposure to these exhaust emissions. Other Canadian researchers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency disagreed citing studies that suggested possible nerve damage.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States and Canada have argued for years over the United States' 27% duty on Canadian softwood lumber imports. Canada filed many motions to have the duty eliminated and the collected duties returned to Canada.[85] After the United States lost an appeal  before a NAFTA panel, it responded by saying \\"We are, of course, disappointed with the [NAFTA panel's] decision, but it will have no impact on the anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders.\\" (spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman)[86] On July 21, 2006, the United States Court of International Trade found that imposition of the duties was contrary to U.S. law.[87][88]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 30, 2007, American citizens Marvin and Elaine Gottlieb filed a Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration under NAFTA, claiming thousands of U.S. investors lost a total of $5 billion in the fall-out from the Conservative Government's decision the previous year to change the tax rate on income trusts in the energy sector. On April 29, 2009, a determination was made that this change in tax law was not expropriation.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral studies have rejected NAFTA responsibility for depressing the incomes of poor corn farmers. The trend existed more than a decade before NAFTA existed. Also, maize production increased after 1994, and there wasn't a measurable impact on the price of Mexican corn because of subsidized[who?] corn from the United States. The studies agreed that the abolition of U.S. agricultural subsidies would benefit Mexican farmers.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreparations for NAFTA included cancellation of Article 27 of Mexico's constitution, the cornerstone of Emiliano Zapata's revolution in 1910ÿ1919. Under the historic Article 27, Indian communal landholdings were protected from sale or privatization. However, this barrier to investment was incompatible with NAFTA. Indian farmers feared the loss of their remaining lands, and also feared cheap imports (substitutes) from the US. The Zapatistas labelled NAFTA a \\"death sentence\\" to Indian communities all over Mexico. Then EZLN declared war on the Mexican state on January 1, 1994, the day NAFTA came into force.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother contentious issue is the  investor-state dispute settlement obligations contained in Chapter 11 of NAFTA.[92] Chapter 11 allows corporations or individuals to sue Mexico, Canada or the United States for compensation when actions taken by those governments (or by those for whom they are responsible at international law, such as provincial, state, or municipal governments) violate international law.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis chapter has been criticized by groups in the U.S.,[94] Mexico,[95] and Canada[96] for a variety of reasons, including not taking into account important social and environmental[97] considerations. In Canada, several groups, including the Council of Canadians, challenged the constitutionality of Chapter 11. They lost at the trial level[98] and have subsequently appealed.[when?]\\r\\n\\r\\nMethanex Corporation, a Canadian corporation, filed a US$970 million suit against the United States because, it said, a California ban on Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), a substance that had found its way into many wells in the state, was hurtful to the corporation's sales of methanol. The claim was rejected, and the company was ordered to pay US$3 million to the U.S. government in costs,  based on the following reasoning: \\"But as a matter of general international law, a non-discriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with due process and, which affects, inter alios, a foreign investor or investment is not deemed expropriatory and compensable unless specific commitments had been given by the regulating government to the then putative foreign investor contemplating investment that the government would refrain from such regulation.\\"[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another case, Metalclad, an American corporation, was awarded US$15.6 million from Mexico after a Mexican municipality refused a construction permit for the hazardous waste landfill it intended to construct in Guadalczar, San Luis Potos. The construction had already been approved by the federal government with various environmental requirements imposed (see paragraph 48 of the tribunal decision). The NAFTA panel found that the municipality did not have the authority to ban construction on the basis of its environmental concerns.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Eli Lilly and Company v. Government of Canada[101] the plaintiff presented a US$500 million claim for the way Canada requires usefulness in its drug patent legislation.[102] Apotex is sued the U.S. for US$520 million because of opportunity it says it lost in an FDA generic drug decision.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nLone Pine Resources Inc. v. Government of Canada[103] filed a US$250 million claim against Canada, accusing it of \\"arbitrary, capricious and illegal\\" behaviour,[104] because Quebec intends to prevent fracking exploration under the St. Lawrence Seaway.[102] Milos Barutciski, the lawyer for Lone Pine, has decried portrayals of his client as \\"another rapacious multinational challenging governments' ability to regulate for health, safety and the environment\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nLone Pine Resources is incorporated in Delaware but headquartered in Calgary,[104] and had an initial public offering on the NYSE May 25, 2011, of 15 million shares each for $13, which raised US$195 million.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nBarutciski acknowledged \\"that NAFTA and other investor-protection treaties create an anomaly in that Canadian companies that have also seen their permits rescinded by the very same Quebec legislation, which expressly forbids the paying of compensation, do not have the right (to) pursue a NAFTA claim\\", and that winning \\"compensation in Canadian courts for domestic companies in this case would be more difficult since the Constitution puts property rights in provincial hands\\".[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nA treaty[clarification needed] with China would extend similar rights to Chinese investors, including SOEs.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso contentious is NAFTA's Chapter 19, which subjects antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) determinations to binational panel review instead of, or in addition to, conventional judicial review.[106] For example, in the United States, review of agency decisions imposing antidumping and countervailing duties are normally heard before the U.S. Court of International Trade, an Article III court. NAFTA parties, however, have the option of appealing the decisions to binational panels composed of five citizens from the two relevant NAFTA countries.[106] The panelists are generally lawyers experienced in international trade law. Since NAFTA does not include substantive provisions concerning AD/CVD, the panel is charged with determining whether final agency determinations involving AD/CVD conform with the country's domestic law. Chapter 19 is an anomaly in international dispute settlement since it does not apply international law, but requires a panel composed of individuals from many countries to re-examine the application of one country's domestic law.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Chapter 19 panel is expected to examine whether the agency's determination is supported by \\"substantial evidence\\". This standard assumes significant deference to the domestic agency.\\r\\nSome of the most controversial trade disputes in recent years, such as the U.S.ÿCanada softwood lumber dispute, have been litigated before Chapter 19 panels.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecisions by Chapter 19 panels can be challenged before a NAFTA extraordinary challenge committee. However, an extraordinary challenge committee does not function as an ordinary appeal.[106] Under NAFTA, it will only vacate or remand a decision if the decision involves a significant and material error that threatens the integrity of the NAFTA dispute settlement system. Since January 2006, no NAFTA party has successfully challenged a Chapter 19 panel's decision before an extraordinary challenge committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 60 Minutes interview in September 2015, 2016 presidential candidate Donald Trump called NAFTA \\"the single worst trade deal ever approved in [the United States]\\",[107] and said that if elected, he would \\"either renegotiate it, or we will break it\\".[108][109] Juan Pablo Casta?܇n?(es), president of the trade group Consejo Coordinador Empresarial, expressed concern about renegotiation and the willingness to focus on the car industry.[110] A range of trade experts have said that pulling out of NAFTA would have a range of unintended consequences for the United States, including reduced access to the its  biggest export markets, a reduction in economic growth, and higher prices for gasoline, cars, fruits, and vegetables.[111] Members of the private initiative in Mexico noted that to eliminate NAFTA, many laws must be adapted by the U.S. Congress. The move would also eventually result in legal complaints by the World Trade Organization.[110] The Washington Post noted that a Congressional Research Service review of academic literature concluded that the \\"net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP\\".[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nDemocratic candidate Bernie Sanders opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which he called \\"a continuation of other disastrous trade agreements, like NAFTA, CAFTA, and permanent normal trade relations with China\\". He believes that free trade agreements have caused a loss of American jobs and depressed American wages. Sanders has said that America needs to rebuild its manufacturing base using American factories for well-paying jobs for American labor rather than outsourcing to China and elsewhere.[112][113][114]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after his election, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would begin renegotiating the terms of NAFTA, to resolve trade issues he had campaigned on. The leaders of Canada and Mexico have indicated their willingness to work with the Trump administration.[115] Although vague on the exact terms he seeks in a renegotiated NAFTA, Trump threatened to withdraw from it if negotiations fail.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2017, the Trump administration provided a detailed list of changes that it would like to see to NAFTA.[117] The top priority was a reduction in the United States' trade deficit.[117][118] The administration also called for the elimination of provisions that allowed Canada and Mexico to appeal duties imposed by the United States and limited the ability of the United States to impose import restrictions on Canada and Mexico.[117] The list also alleged subsidized state-owned enterprises and currency manipulation.[117][119]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the Trump administration's list \\"is very consistent with the president's stance on liking trade barriers, liking protectionism. This makes NAFTA in many respects less of a free-trade agreement.\\"[117] The concerns expressed by the US Trade Representative over subsidized state-owned enterprises and currency manipulation are not thought to apply to Canada and Mexico, but rather to be designed to send a message to countries beyond North America.[117] Jeffrey Schott of the Peterson Institute for International Economics noted that it would not be possible to conclude renegotiations quickly while also addressing all the concerns on the list.[119] He also said that it would be difficult to do anything about trade deficits.[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn October 2017 op-ed in Toronto's Globe and Mail questioned whether the United States wanted to re-negotiate the agreement or planned to walk away from it no matter what, noting that newly appointed American ambassador Kelly Knight Craft is married to the owner of Alliance Resource Partners, a big US coal operation. Canada is  implementing a carbon plan, and there is also the matter of a sale of Bombardier jets. \\"The Americans inserted so many poison pills into last week's talks in Washington that they should have been charged with murder\\", wrote the columnist, John Ibbitson.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"A number of the proposals that the United States has put on the table have little or no support from the U.S. business and agriculture community. It isn't clear who they're intended to benefit\\", said John Murphy, vice-president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.[121] Pat Roberts, the senior US senator from Kansas, called for an outcry against Trump anti-NAFTA moves, saying the \\"issues affect real jobs, real lives and real people\\". Kansas is a major agricultural exporter, and farm groups warn that just threatening to leave NAFTA might cause buyers to minimize uncertainty by seeking out non-US sources.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nA fourth round of talks included a U.S. demand for a sunset clause that would end the agreement in five years, unless the three countries agreed to keep it in place, a provision U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said would allow the countries to kill the deal if it was not working. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with the House Ways and Means Committee, since Congress would have to pass legislation rolling back the treaty's provisions if Trump tries to withdraw from the pact.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Donald Trump's election to the presidency, a range of trade experts have said that pulling out of NAFTA as Trump proposed would have a range of unintended consequences for the U.S., including reduced access to the U.S.'s biggest export markets, a reduction in economic growth, and increased prices for gasoline, cars, fruits, and vegetables.[12] The worst affected sectors would be textiles, agriculture and automobiles.[123][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Tufts University political scientist Daniel W. Drezner, the Trump administration's desire to return relations with Mexico to the pre-NAFTA era are misguided. Drezner argues that NAFTA made it easier for Mexico to transform to a real democracy and become a country that views itself as North American. If Trump acts on many of the threats that he has made against Mexico, it is not inconceivable that Mexicans would turn to left-wing populist strongmen, as several South American countries have. At the very least, US-Mexico relations would worsen, with adverse implications for cooperation on border security, counterterrorism, drug-war cooperation, deportations and managing Central American migration.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Chad P. Bown (senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics), \\"a renegotiated NAFTA that would reestablish trade barriers is unlikely to help workers who lost their jobsregardless of the causetake advantage of new employment opportunities\\".[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Harvard economist Marc Melitz, \\"recent research estimates that the repeal of NAFTA would not increase car production in the United States\\".[11] Melitz notes that this would cost manufacturing jobs.[11][clarification needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) comes into effect, existing agreements such as NAFTA will be reduced to those provisions that do not conflict with the TPP, or that require greater trade liberalization than the TPP.[125] However, only Canada and Mexico will have the prospect of becoming members of the TPP after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in January 2017. In May 2017, the 11 remaining members of the TPP, including Canada and Mexico, agreed to proceed with the trade deal without U.S. participation.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American public is largely divided on its view of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with a wide partisan gap in beliefs. In a February 2018 Gallup Poll, 48% of Americans said NAFTA was good for the U.S., while 46% said it was bad.[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a journal from the Law and Business Review of the Americas (LBRA), U.S. public opinion of NAFTA centers around three issues: NAFTA's impact on the creation or destruction of American jobs, NAFTA's impact on the environment, and NAFTA's impact on immigrants entering the U.S.[128]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter President Trump's election in 2016, support for NAFTA has become very polarized between Republicans and Democrats. Donald Trump expressed negative views of NAFTA, calling it \\"the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country\\".[129] Republican support for NAFTA has decreased from 43% support in 2008 to 34% in 2017. Meanwhile, Democrat support for NAFTA has increased from 41% support in 2008 to 71% in 2017.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe political gap is especially large in concern to views on free trade with Mexico. As opposed to a favorable view of free trade with Canada, whom 79% of American describe as a fair trade partner, only 47% of Americans believe Mexico practices fair trade. The gap widens between Democrats and Republicans: 60% of Democrats believe Mexico is practicing fair trade, while only 28% of Republicans do. This is the highest level from Democrats and the lowest level from Republicans ever recorded by the Chicago Council Survey. Republicans have more negative views of Canada as a fair trade partner than Democrats, as well.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nNAFTA has strong support from young Americans. In a February 2017 Gallup poll, 73% of Americans aged 18ÿ29 said NAFTA was good for the U.S, showing higher support than any other U.S. age group.[127] It also has slightly stronger support from unemployed Americans than from employed Americans.[131] The issue of NAFTA continues to remain a predominantly divisive issue.","input":"When did the north american free trade agreement start?"},{"output":"the adenoid tonsil, two tubal tonsils, two palatine tonsils, and the lingual tonsil","context":"Tonsils are collections of lymphoid tissue[1] facing into the aerodigestive tract. The set of lymphatic tissue known as Waldeyer's tonsillar ring includes the adenoid tonsil, two tubal tonsils, two palatine tonsils, and the lingual tonsil.\\r\\nWhen used unqualified, the term most commonly refers specifically to the palatine tonsils, which are masses of lymphatic material situated at either side of the back of the human throat. The palatine tonsils and the nasopharyngeal tonsil are lymphoepithelial tissues located near the oropharynx and nasopharynx (parts of the throat).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTonsils in humans include, from anterior (front), superior (top), posterior (back), and inferior (bottom):\\r\\nNormally, each tonsil measures up to 2.5 cm in length, 2.0 cm in width and 1.2 cm in thickness.[3]\\r\\nTonsils tend to reach their largest size near puberty, and they gradually undergo atrophy thereafter. However, they are largest relative to the diameter of the throat in young children.\\r\\nThese immunocompetent tissues are the immune system's first line of defense against ingested or inhaled foreign pathogens, and as such frequently engorge with blood to assist in immune responses to common illnesses such as the common cold. Tonsils have on their surface specialized antigen capture cells called M cells that allow for the uptake of antigens produced by pathogens. These M cells then alert the underlying B cells and T cells in the tonsil that a pathogen is present and an immune response is stimulated.[4] B cells are activated and proliferate in areas called germinal centres in the tonsil. These germinal centres are places where B memory cells are created and secretory antibody (IgA) is produced.\\r\\nRecent studies have provided evidence that the tonsils produce T lymphocytes, also known as T-cells, in a manner similar to, but different from, the way the thymus does.[5]\\r\\nTonsils can become enlarged (adenotonsillar hyperplasia) or inflamed (tonsillitis) and may require surgical removal (tonsillectomy). This may be indicated if they obstruct the airway or interfere with swallowing, or in patients with frequent recurrent tonsillitis. However, different mechanisms of pathogenesis for these two subtypes of tonsillar hypertrophy have been described,[6] and may have different responses to identical therapeutic efforts. In older patients, asymmetric tonsils (also known as asymmetric tonsil hypertrophy) may be an indicator of virally infected tonsils, or tumors such as lymphoma or squamous cell carcinoma.\\r\\nTonsillitis is a disorder in which the tonsils are inflamed (sore and swollen). The most common way to treat it is with anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, or if bacterial in origin, antibiotics, e.g. amoxicillin and azithromycin. Often severe and/or recurrent tonsillitis is treated by tonsillectomy.[7][8]\\r\\nA tonsillolith is material that accumulates on the tonsil. They can range up to the size of a peppercorn and are white/cream in color. The main substance is mostly calcium, but they have a strong unpleasant odor because of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan and other chemicals.[citation needed]\\r\\nTonsil enlargement can affect speech, making it hypernasal and giving it the sound of velopharyngeal incompetence (when space in the mouth is not fully separated from the nose's air space).[9] Tonsil size may have a more significant impact on upper airway obstruction for obese children than for those of average weight.[10]\\r\\nAs mucosal lymphatic tissue of the aerodigestive tract, the tonsils are viewed in some classifications as belonging to both the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Other viewpoints treat them (and the spleen and thymus) as large lymphatic organs contradistinguished from the smaller tissue loci of GALT and MALT.\\r\\nIllustration of frontal view of tonsils","input":"How many types of tonsils do we have?"},{"output":"Pius \\"Mau\\" Piailug","context":"Hkle?a[2][3] is a performance-accurate wa?a kaulua,[4][5] a Polynesian double-hulled voyaging canoe.[6][7] Launched on 8 March?1975[8] by the Polynesian Voyaging Society, she is best known for her 1976 Hawai?i to Tahiti voyage completed with exclusively Polynesian navigation techniques[9][10] The primary goal of the voyage was to explore the anthropological theory of the Asiatic origin of native Oceanic people (Oceania maps:detail, region), of Polynesians and Hawaiians in particular, as the result of purposeful trips through the Pacific, as opposed to passive drifting on currents, or sailing from the Americas.[11][12] (DNA analysis illuminates this theory.[13]) A secondary project goal was to have the canoe and voyage \\"serve as vehicles for the cultural revitalization of Hawaiians and other Polynesians\\".[14]\\r\\nBetween the 1976 voyage and 2009, Hklea completed nine[update] additional voyages to Micronesia, Polynesia, Japan, Canada and the mainland United States, all using ancient wayfinding techniques of celestial navigation. On 19 January?2007, Hklea left Hawai?i with the voyaging canoe Alingano Maisu on a voyage through Micronesia (map) and ports in southern Japan.[a] The voyage was expected to take five months. On 9 June?2007,[15] Hklea completed the \\"One Ocean, One People\\" voyage to Yokohama, Japan. On April 5, 2009,[16] Hklea returned to Honolulu following a roundtrip training sail to Palmyra Atoll,[17][18] undertaken to develop skills of potential crewmembers for Hklea's eventual circumnavigation of the earth.[19]\\r\\nOn May 18, 2014, Hklea and her sister vessel, Hikianalia embarked from Oahu for \\"Malama Honua\\", a three-year circumnavigation of the earth. She returned to port in Hawaii on June 17, 2017. The journey covered 47,000 nautical miles with stops at 85 ports in 26 countries.[20][21]\\r\\nIn between voyages, Hklea is moored at the Marine Education Training Center (METC) of Honolulu Community College in Honolulu Harbor.\\r\\nPolynesian voyaging canoes were made from wood, whereas Hklea incorporates plywood, fiberglass and resin.[8] Hklea measures 61?feet 5?inches (18.7?m) LOA, 15?feet 6?inches (4.72?m) at beam, displaces 16,000 pounds (7,260?kg) when empty and can carry another 11,000 pounds (4,990?kg) of gear, supplies and 12 to 16 crew. Fully laden, with her 540-square-foot (50.2?m2) sail area,[22] she is capable of speeds of 4 to 6 knots (5 to 7?mph; 7 to 10?km/h)[8] while reaching in 15-to-25-knot (17 to 29?mph; 28 to 46?km/h) trade winds. Her twin masts are rigged either crab claw or Marconi style with a small jib. She is steered with a long paddle. She has no auxiliary motor. Her escort vessel tows her into harbor when necessary. Her name means \\"star of gladness\\" in Hawaiian, which refers to Arcturus, a guiding zenith star for Hawaiian navigators.[8] Arcturus passes directly overhead at Hawai?i's latitude, helping sailors find the islands.\\r\\nHklea navigates without instruments. In 1975, no Hawaiian living knew the ancient techniques for blue water voyaging.[23] To enable the voyage, the Polynesian Voyaging Society recruited the Satawalese Master Navigator Mau Piailug (of the Weriyeng school in the Caroline Islands (map) of the Federated States of Micronesia (map)) to share his knowledge of non-instrument navigation. While as many as six Micronesian navigators had mastered these traditional methods as of the mid-1970s,[24] only Mau was willing to share his knowledge.\\r\\nMau, who \\"barely spoke English\\", decided that by reaching beyond his own culture, sharing what had been closely guarded knowledge, he could possibly save it from extinction. Through this collaboration, Mau's mentorship helped \\"spark pride in the Hawaiian and Polynesian culture\\", leading to \\"a renaissance of voyaging, canoe building, and non-instrument navigation that has continued to grow, spreading across Polynesia (map) and reaching to its far corners of Aotearoa, New Zealand and Rapanui, Easter Island\\".[25]\\r\\nLed by Captain Elia David Ku?ualoha \\"Kawika\\" Kapahulehua* and Navigator Pius \\"Mau\\" Piailug, a Yapese master navigator.*,[26] Hkle?a departed Honolua Bay, Maui, Hawai?i for Pape?ete, Tahiti, (voyage map) as part of the celebration of the United States Bicentennial. Mau navigated from Hawaii to Tahiti without instruments. The return leg employed western instruments (compass, nautical charts, sextant, chronometer, dividers, parallel rulers, pencil, nautical almanac).[27]\\r\\nIn English, the Hawaiian \\"Ke ala i kahiki\\" means \\"the path to Tahiti.\\" The \\"Kealaikahiki Project\\" recreated the traditional Kealaikahiki Point departure of ancient voyages to Tahiti.[33] Gordon Pi?ianai?a's idea to recreate traditional departures took Hkle?a southeast, across Kealaikahiki Channel between Lna?i and Kaho?olawe Islands, past Kealaikahiki Point, into the ?Alenuihh Channel and the northeast trade winds. The object was to determine whether Hkle?a, departing from west of the 1976 departure point, would bisect the more easterly 1976 voyage track, and so likely reach Tahiti were she to continue. After heading south for two days, Hkle?a did not bisect the 1976 voyage track, but likely would have (further south than anticipated). She came about and returned to Hawai?i. The traditional departure point would be used for subsequent sailings to Tahiti.[34][35]\\r\\nNavigator: Nainoa Thompson; Captain: Dave Lyman; Crew: Teen Froiseth, Sam Ka?ai, Sam Kalalau, John Kruse, \\"Kimo\\" Lyman, Jerome \\"Jerry\\" Muller, Gordon Pi?ianai?a, Norman Pi?ianai?a, Michael A.

The crew hung on to the swamped canoe through the night. Flares were unseen by passing aircraft; the emergency radio reached no help. By mid-morning, with no sign of imminent rescue and the swamped canoe drifting farther from land, Eddie Aikau, a North Shore, O?ahu, lifeguard of the year, 1977 Duke Kahanamoku champion and big-wave surfer, valiantly attempted to paddle a surfboard 12ÿ15 miles (19ÿ24?km) to Lna?i for help. About nine hours later, flares launched by the crew were spotted by a Hawaiian Airlines flight which circled Hkle?a and radioed the United States Coast Guard (\\"USCG\\"). Half an hour later, a USCG search and rescue helicopter was hovering overhead; Hkle?a crew was rescued. The following morning, the USCGC?Cape Corwin towed the vessel, from 22 miles southwest of L?au Point, Moloka?i, back to Honolulu.[38] Despite intensive land, air and sea search, Eddie Aikau was never seen again.

Mau sailed as an observer. After 29 days at sea, before sighting Mataiva on the way to Tahiti, Mau offered Nainoa only one correction; of Nainoa's interpretation of sighting a land-based seabird in mid-morning flight. Such birds generally fly seaward for food at morning and return to land in the evening. While it can usually be assumed that land lies opposite the birds' morning flight direction, this bird spotted mid-morning (during nesting season), carried a fish in its beak.[43] This detail suggested to Mau that the bird's morning flight was not away from land but toward it. The bird was not flying seaward to find more fish, but rather, was returning to land, to feed its young.[44] Leading up to the voyage, an extensive, formal crew training program helped to ensure a safe voyage.[45] Escort boat Ishka followed for safety.[39][46][47]\\r\\nNavigator: Nainoa Thompson; Captain: Gordon Pi?ianai?a; Chad Kalepa Baybayan, \\"Shorty\\" Bertelmann, Harry Ho, Sam Ka?ai, Michael \\"Buddy\\" McGuire, Marion Lyman-Mersereau, Mau Piailug, Steve Somsen, Joanne Kahanamoku Sterling*, Leon Paoa Sterling, \\"Tava\\" Taupu; Patrick Koon Hung Pi?imauna Charles \\"Pat\\" Aiu, MD*?[48]\\r\\nNavigator: Nainoa Thompson; Captain: Gordon Pi?ianai?a; Wedemeyer Au, Chad Baybayan, Bruce Blankenfeld, \\"Snake\\" Ah Hee, John Kruse, Kainoa Lee, James \\"Kimo\\" Lyman, Mau Piailug, Steven Somsen, Leon Paoa Sterling, Michael Tongg, Nathan Wong\\r\\nIn the \\"Voyage of Rediscovery\\", Hkle?a traveled 12,000 miles (19,000?km) to destinations throughout Polynesia.[50][51] Inviting fellow Polynesians to join the crew on legs of the voyage extended Hkle?a's success in revitalizing interest in Polynesian culture.

They participated in a gathering of voyaging canoes from across Oceania at nearby Marae Taputapuatea, Ra?iatea, which led to the lifting of a six-centuries-old tapu on voyaging from Ra?iatea.[64] Then all the canoes returned to Tahiti, sailed to Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas and on to Hawai?i.[65] This was only the first part of a voyage spanning spring and summer known as \\"N ?Ohana Holo Moana\\" or The Voyaging Families of the Vast Ocean.[40][66] Hkle?a was escorted by Gershon II under Steve Kornberg; Rizaldar, under Randy Wichman, also escorted.\\r\\nSailing Master: Nainoa Thompson; Navigators: Ka?au McKenney, Keahi Omai; Crew: Shantell Ching, Junior Coleman, Catherine Fuller, Harry Ho, Mau Piailug, Sesario Sewralur (son of Mau Piailug), Ben Tamura, MD; \\"Tava\\" Taupu, Michael Tongg, Kamaki Worthington.

Both vessels were shipped from Hawai?i to Seattle, Washington, after which they sailed to Vancouver, British Columbia. They visited intermediate ports, where local American Indian tribes often hosted them to a dinner and gift exchange. From Vancouver, Hawaiiloa sailed as far north as Haines, Alaska.[74] Hkle?a sailed south to San Diego via Portland, Oregon, and the California ports of San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Long Beach. The voyaging canoes were shipped back to Hawai?i: Hkle?a from San Pedro; Hawaiiloa from Seattle. This summer part of the voyage promoted cultural and educational exchanges with Hawaiians (some of whom had never been to Hawai?i), Native Americans, and other people living on the United States West Coast.\\r\\nCrew: Captains: Gordon Pi?ianai?a, \\"Kimo\\" Lyman, Michael Tongg, Chad Baybayan; Crew: Gil Ane, Beth Atuatasi (ne Saurer),[75] Moana Doi, Laulima Lyman, Leon Sterling, Matthew Tongg[76][77]\\r\\nHkle?a visited:[78]\\r\\nHkle?a visited:[78]\\r\\nHkle?a visited:[78]\\r\\nHkle?a visited:[78]\\r\\nHkle?a visited:[78]\\r\\nHkle?a visited:[78]\\r\\nHkle?a sailed from Hawai?i to Rapa Nui (Easter Island) and back, via the Marquesas Islands of French Polynesia.[81] While in the Marquesas, short trips were made between principal islands of the group (map).[82] A brief stop was made at Pitcairn Island on the Mangareva ÿ Rapa Nui leg. A technically challenging voyage due to Rapa Nui's isolation and location over 1,000 miles upwind;[83] it is known as \\"Closing the Triangle\\" because it took the canoe to the southeastern Pacific for the first time.[84] Kama Hele escorted the voyage.[85]\\r\\nNavigator and Captain: Bruce Blankenfeld; Apprentice Navigator: Pi?ikea Miller; Watch Captains: Dennis Chun, Terry Hee, Leon Paoa Sterling; Crew: Russell Amimoto, Desmon Antone, Darcy Attisani, Kekama Helm, Ka?au McKenney, Atwood Makanani, Hau?oli Smith, Wallace Wong[85]\\r\\nNavigator and Captain: Chad Baybayan; Apprentice Navigators: Moana Doi, Catherine Fuller; Student Navigator: Aldon Kim; Watch Captains: Terry Hee, Mel Paoa, \\"Tava\\" Taupu; Protocol Officer: Kaniela Akaka; Crew: Tim Gilliom, Kealoha Hoe, Aeronwy Polo, Mona Shintani, Gary Suzuki, Nalani Wilson, Gary Yuen[87]\\r\\nNavigator and Captain: Nainoa Thompson; Navigators: Bruce Blankenfeld, Chad Baybayan; Medical Officer: Ben Tamura, MD; Photographer and Videographer: Sonny Ahuna; Crew: Shantell Ching, Terry Hee, Mel Paoa, \\"Tava\\" Taupu, Michael Tongg, Max Yarawamai, Aaron Young[88]\\r\\nNavigator: Bruce Blankenfeld; Captain: \\"Wally\\" Froiseth; Crew: Na?alehu Anthony, Bob Bee, Blane Chong, Dennis Chun, Terry Hee, Nalani Kaneakua, Kawika Crivello, Kealoha Hoe, \\"Kimo\\" Lyman, Kawai Warren, Kamaki Worthington[89]\\r\\nNavigator: Nainoa Thompson; Navigator: Shantell Ching; Crew: \\"Snake\\" Ah Hee, Chad Baybayan, Pomaikalani \\"Pomai\\" Bertelmann, Bruce Blankenfeld, Sam Low, Joey Mallot, Kahualaulani Mick, Ka?iulani Murphy, Kau?i Pelekane, \\"Tava\\" Taupu, Michael Tongg, Dr. Patrice Ming-Lei Tim Sing, Kona Woolsey[90]\\r\\nIn 2003, Hkle?a sailed to Nihoa, the closest of the \\"leeward,\\" or Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (maps: small and large scale), to set the stage[91] for the 2004 voyage to the furthest, most westerly of them, Kure Atoll.[92] Hkle?a's 2004 voyage took the canoe through the area now comprising the Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument[93] to promote stewardship and awareness of this area. Hkle?a participated in an interagency initiative with this voyage named after it, called \\"Navigating Change\\".[94] Upon reaching the remote islands, the crew helped remove hundreds of pounds of washed-up fishing nets that threatened Hawaiian monk seals and Hawaiian Green sea turtles and also helped with plant conservation. About 1,600 schoolchildren linked to the vessel by daily satellite phone calls. Teachers prepared with curriculum guides, video and web resources.[95] Navigating Change was supported by US Fish & Wildlife Service, Polynesian Voyaging Society, Bishop Museum, NOAA, Hawai'i Department of Education, Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources, Hawai?i Maritime Center, University of Hawai?i, The Nature Conservancy, Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, Coastal Zone Management Hawai?i, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, Harold K.L.

The event was first held in 1930, and has taken place every four years since then.[1] The Commonwealth Games were known as the British Empire Games from 1930 to 1950, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games from 1954 to 1966, and British Commonwealth Games from 1970 to 1974. It is the world's first multi-sport event which inducted equal number of womens and mens medal events and was implemented recently in the 2018 Commonwealth Games.[2]\\r\\nTheir creation was inspired by the Inter-Empire Championships, as a part of the Festival of Empire, which were held in London, United Kingdom in 1911. Melville Marks Robinson founded the games as the British Empire Games which were first hosted in Hamilton in 1930.[3] During the 20th and 21st centuries, the evolution of the games movement has resulted in several changes to the Commonwealth Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Commonwealth Winter Games for snow and ice sports for the commonwealth athletes,[4] the Commonwealth Paraplegic Games for commonwealth athletes with a disability[5] and the Commonwealth Youth Games for commonwealth athletes aged 14 to 18. The first edition of the winter games and paraplegic games were held in 1958 and 1962 respectively, with their last edition held in 1966 and 1974 respectively and the first youth games were held in 2000. The 1942 and 1946 Commonwealth Games were cancelled because of the second world war.[6]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Games are overseen by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF), which also controls the sporting programme and selects the host cities. The games movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), Commonwealth Games Associations (CGAs), and organising committees for each specific Commonwealth Games. There are several rituals and symbols, such as the Commonwealth Games flag and Queen's Baton, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 5,000 athletes compete at the Commonwealth Games in more than 15 different sports and more than 250 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Commonwealth Games medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively. Apart from many Olympic sports, the games also include some sports that are played predominantly in Commonwealth countries but which are not part of the Olympic programme, such as lawn bowls, netball and squash.[7]\\r\\nAlthough there are currently 53 members of the Commonwealth of Nations, 71 teams currently participate in the Commonwealth Games, as a number of dependent territories compete under their own flags. The four Home Nations of the United KingdomEngland, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Irelandalso send separate teams.\\r\\nNineteen cities in nine countries (counting England, Wales, and Scotland separately) have hosted the event. Australia has hosted the Commonwealth Games five times (1938, 1962, 1982, 2006 and 2018); this is more times than any other nation. Two cities have hosted Commonwealth Games more than once: Auckland (1950, 1990) and Edinburgh (1970, 1986).\\r\\nOnly six countries have attended every Commonwealth Games: Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, Scotland, and Wales. Australia has been the highest achieving team for twelve games, England for seven, and Canada for one.\\r\\nThe most recent Commonwealth Games were held at Gold Coast from 4 to 15 April 2018. The next Commonwealth Games are to be held in Birmingham from 27 July to 7 August 2022.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA sporting competition bringing together the members of the British Empire was first proposed by John Astley Cooper in 1900, when he wrote an article in The Times suggesting a \\"Pan-Britannic-Pan-Anglican Contest and Festival every four years as a means of increasing goodwill and good understanding of the British Empire\\". John Astley Cooper Committees were formed worldwide (e.g. Australia) and helped Pierre de Coubertin to get his international Olympic Games off the ground.[8] In 1911, the Festival of the Empire was held at The Crystal Palace in London to celebrate the coronation of George V. As part of the Festival of the Empire, an Inter-Empire Championships were held in which teams from Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United Kingdom competed in athletics, boxing, wrestling and swimming events.\\r\\nCanada won the championships and was gifted a silver cup which was 2 feet 6 inch high and weighed 340 oz (9.6 kg). It was gifted by Lord Lonsdale. However, the 1911 championships were followed by the first world war which happened from 1914 to 1918. The organisers had lost hopes of hosting such sporting events for the empire athletes.\\r\\nMelville Marks Robinson, who went to the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam to serve as the manager of the Canadian track and field team, strongly lobbied for the proposal of organising the first British Empire Games in Hamilton in 1930.\\r\\nThe?1930?British Empire?Games?were the first of what later become known as the?Commonwealth Games, and were held in?Hamilton, in the province of?Ontario?in?Canada?from August 16ÿ23, 1930.\\r\\nEleven countries sent a total of 400 athletes to the Hamilton Games. The opening and closing ceremonies as well as athletics took place at Civic Stadium. The participant nations were Australia, Bermuda, British Guyana, Canada, England, Northern Ireland, Newfoundland, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa and Wales. The Hamilton Games featured six sports: athletics, boxing, lawn bowls, rowing, swimming and diving and wrestling and ran at a cost of $97,973. Women competed in only the aquatic events.[9] Canadian triple jumper Gordon Smallacombe won the first ever gold medal in the history of the Games.[3]\\r\\nThe?1934 British Empire Games?were the second of what is now known as the?Commonwealth Games, held in London, England. The host city was?London, with the main venue at?Wembley Park, although the track cycling events were in?Manchester. The 1934 Games had originally been awarded to Johannesburg, but were given to London instead because of serious concerns about prejudice against black and Asian athletes in South Africa. Seventeen national teams took part, including the Irish Free State (the only Games in which they did take part) and new participants Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Southern Rhodesia and Trinidad and Tobago.[10]\\r\\nThe?1938 British Empire Games?were the third?British Empire Games, which were held in?Sydney,?New South Wales, Australia. They were timed to coincide with Sydney's sesqui-centenary (150 years since the foundation of British settlement in Australia).?Held in the southern hemisphere for the first time, the III Games opening ceremony took place at the famed Sydney Cricket Ground in front of 40,000 spectators. Fifteen nations participated down under at the Sydney Games involving a total of 464 athletes and 43 officials. Fiji and Ceylon made their debuts. Seven sports were featured in the Sydney Games ÿ athletics, boxing, cycling, lawn bowls, rowing, swimming and diving and wrestling.[11]\\r\\nThe?1950 British Empire Games?were the fourth edition and was held in?Auckland, New Zealand after a 12-year gap from the third edition of the games. The fourth games were originally awarded to?Montreal, Canada?and were to be held in 1942 but were cancelled due to?the Second World War. The opening ceremony at Eden Park was attended by 40,000 spectators, while nearly 250,000 people attended the Auckland Games. Twelve countries sent a total of 590 athletes to Auckland. Malaya and Nigeria made their first appearances.[12]\\r\\nThe fifth edition of the games, the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, were held in?Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. These were the first games since the name change from?British Empire Games?took effect in 1952. The fifth edition of the Games placed Vancouver on a world stage and featured memorable sporting moments as well as outstanding entertainment, technical innovation and cultural events. The Miracle Mile, as it became known, saw both the gold medallist, Roger Bannister of England and silver medallist John Landy of Australia, run sub-four minute races in an event that was televised live across the world for the first time. Northern Rhodesia and Pakistan made their debuts and both performed well, winning eight and six medals respectively.[13]\\r\\nThe?1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games were held in?Cardiff,?Wales.?The sixth edition of the games marked the largest sporting event ever held in Wales and it was the smallest country ever to host a British Empire and Commonwealth Games. Cardiff had to wait 12 years longer than originally scheduled to become host of the Games, as the 1946 event was cancelled because of the Second World War. The Cardiff Games introduced the?Queen's Baton Relay, which has been conducted as a prelude to every British Empire and Commonwealth Games ever since. Thirty-five nations sent a total of 1,122 athletes and 228 officials to the Cardiff Games and 23 countries and dependencies won medals, including for the first time, Singapore, Ghana, Kenya and the Isle of Man.[14]\\r\\nThe?1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games?were held in?Perth,?Western Australia,?Australia. Thirty-five countries sent a total of 863 athletes and 178 officials to Perth. Jersey was among the medal winners for the first time, while British Honduras, Dominica, Papua and New Guinea and St Lucia all made their inaugural Games appearances. Aden also competed by special invitation. Sarawak, North Borneo and Malaya competed for the last time before taking part in 1966 under the Malaysian flag. In addition, Rhodesia and Nyasaland competed in the Games as an entity for the first and only time.[15]\\r\\nThe?1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games?were held in?Kingston, Jamaica. This was the first time that the Games had been held outside the so-called?White Dominions. Thirty-four nations (including South Arabia) competed in the Kingston Games sending a total of 1,316 athletes and officials.[16]\\r\\nThe?1970 British Commonwealth Games?were held in?Edinburgh,?Scotland.?This was the first time the name?British Commonwealth Games?was adopted, the first time?metric units?rather than?imperial units?were used in events, the first time the games were held in?Scotland and also the first time that HM Queen Elizabeth II attended in her capacity as Head of the Commonwealth.[17]\\r\\nThe?1974 British?Commonwealth Games?were held in?Christchurch,?New Zealand. The Games were officially named \\"the friendly games\\".?Following the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, the tenth games at Christchurch were the first multi-sport event to place the safety of participants and spectators as its uppermost requirement. Security guards surrounded the athletes village and there was an exceptionally high-profile police presence. Only 22 countries succeeded in winning medals from the total haul of 374 medals on offer, but first time winners included Western Samoa, Lesotho and Swaziland.[18]\\r\\nThe?1978?Commonwealth Games?were held in?Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. This event was the first to bear the current day name of the Commonwealth Games and also marked a new high as almost 1,500 athletes from 46 countries took part. They were boycotted by Nigeria in protest of New Zealand's sporting contacts with apartheid-era South Africa, as well as by Uganda in protest of alleged Canadian hostility towards the government of Idi Amin.[19][20]\\r\\nThe?1982?Commonwealth Games?were held in?Brisbane,?Queensland,?Australia. Forty-six nations participated in the Brisbane Games with a new record total of 1,583 athletes and 571 officials. As hosts, Australia headed the medal table leading the way ahead of England, Canada, Scotland and New Zealand respectively. Zimbabwe made its first appearance at the Games, having earlier competed as Southern Rhodesia and as part of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.[21]\\r\\nThe?1986 Commonwealth Games?were held in Edinburgh, Scotland and were the second Games to be held in Edinburgh. Participation at the 1986 Games was affected by a boycott by 32 African, Asian and Caribbean nations in protest of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's refusal to condemn sporting contacts of apartheid era South Africa in 1985, but the Games rebounded and continued to grow thereafter. Twenty-six nations did attend the second Edinburgh Games and sent a total of 1,662 athletes and 461 officials.[22]\\r\\nThe?1990 Commonwealth Games?were held in?Auckland,?New Zealand. It was the fourteenth?Commonwealth Games, the third to be hosted by New Zealand and Aucklands second. A new record of 55 nations participated in the second Auckland Games sending 2,826 athletes and officials.[23] Pakistan returned to the Commonwealth in 1989 after withdrawing in 1972, and competed in the 1990 Games after an absence of twenty years.[24]\\r\\nThe 1994 Commonwealth Games were held in?Victoria, British Columbia, the fourth to take place in Canada. The games marked?South Africa's return to the Commonwealth Games following the?apartheid?era, and over 30 years since the country last competed in the?Games in 1958. Namibia made its Commonwealth Games debut. It was also?Hong Kong's last appearance at the games before the?transfer of sovereignty?from Britain to?China. Sixty-three nations sent 2,557 athletes and 914 officials.[25]\\r\\nThe?1998 Commonwealth Games?were held in?Kuala Lumpur,?Malaysia. For the first time in its 68-year history, the Commonwealth Games were held in Asia. The sixteenth games were also the first Games to feature team sports - an overwhelming success that added large numbers to both participant and TV audience numbers. A new record of 70 countries sent a total of 5,065 athletes and officials to the Kuala Lumpur Games. The top five countries in the medal standing were Australia, England, Canada, Malaysia and South Africa. Nauru also achieved an impressive haul of three gold medals. Cameroon, Mozambique and Kiribati debuted.[26]\\r\\nThe?2002 Commonwealth Games were held in?Manchester, England. The 2002 Games were to be hosted in England to coincide with the?Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, head of the?Commonwealth. In terms of sports and events, the 2002 Games were until the 2010 edition the largest Commonwealth Games in history featuring 281 events across 17 sports. The final medal tally was led by Australia, followed by host England and Canada. The 2002 Commonwealth Games had set a new benchmark for hosting the Commonwealth Games and for cities wishing to bid for them with a heavy emphasis on legacy.[27]\\r\\nThe?2006?Commonwealth Games were held in?Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The only difference between the 2006 games and the?2002 games?was the absence of?Zimbabwe, which withdrew from the?Commonwealth of Nations. For the first time in the history of the Games the Queen's Baton visited every single Commonwealth nation and territory taking part in the Games, a journey of 180,000?km (112,500 miles). Over 4000 athletes took part in the sporting competitions. Again the Top 3 on the medal table is Australia, followed by England and Canada.[28]\\r\\nThe 2010 Commonwealth Games were held in Delhi, India. The Games cost $11?billion and are the most expensive Commonwealth Games ever. It was the first time that the Commonwealth Games were held in India,also the first time that a Commonwealth Republic hosted the games and the second time they were held in Asia after?Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in?1998.?A total of 6,081 athletes from 71?Commonwealth nations and dependencies?competed in 21 sports and 272 events. The final?medal tally?was led by?Australia. The host nation India achieved its?best performance ever in any sporting event, finishing second overall.[29] Rwanda made its Games debut.[30]\\r\\nThe 2014 Commonwealth Games were held in Glasgow, Scotland. It was the largest?multi-sport event?ever held in Scotland with around 4,950 athletes from 71 different nations and territories competing in 18 different sports, outranking the?1970?and?1986?Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, capital city of Scotland.?Usain Bolt competed in the?4G100 metres relay?of the?2014 Commonwealth Games and set a?Commonwealth Games record with his teammates.[31] The Games received acclaim for their organisation, attendance, and the public enthusiasm of the people of Scotland, with?Commonwealth Games Federation?chief executive Mike Hooper hailing them as \\"the standout games in the history of the movement\\".[32]\\r\\nThe 2018 Commonwealth Games were held in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, the fifth time Australia hosted the Games. There were an equal number of events for men and women, the first time in history that a major?multi-sport event?had equality in terms of events.[33][34]\\r\\nThe 2022 Commonwealth Games will be held in Birmingham, England. They will be the third Commonwealth Games to be hosted in England following London 1934 and Manchester 2002.[35]\\r\\nThe three nations to have hosted the Commonwealth Games the most times are Australia (5), Canada (4) and New Zealand (3). Furthermore, six editions have taken place in the countries within the United Kingdom (Scotland (3), England (2) and Wales (1)), twice in Asia (Malaysia (1) and India (1)) and once in the Caribbean (Jamaica (1)).[1]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Paraplegic Games were an international, multi-sport event involving athletes with a disability from the Commonwealth countries. The event was sometimes referred to as the Paraplegic Empire Games and British Commonwealth Paraplegic Games. Athletes were generally those with spinal injuries or polio. The event was first held in 1962 and disestablished in 1974.[36] The Games were held in the country hosting the Commonwealth Games for able-bodied athletes. The countries that had hosted the Commonwealth Paraplegic Games were Australia, Jamaica, Scotland and New Zealand in 1962, 1966, 1970 and 1974 respectively. Six countries  Australia, England, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales  had been represented at all Commonwealth Paraplegic Games. Australia and England had been the top-ranking nation two times each: 1962, 1974 and 1966, 1970 respectively.\\r\\nAthletes with a disability were then first included in exhibition events at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia,[37] and, at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, they were included as full members of their national teams, making them the first fully inclusive international multi-sport games. This meant that results were included in the medal count.[38]\\r\\nDuring the 2007 General Assembly of the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) at Colombo, Sri Lanka, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and CGF signed a co-operative agreement to ensure a formal institutional relationship between the two bodies and secure the future participation of elite athletes with a disability (EAD) in future Commonwealth Games.\\r\\nIPC President Philip Craven said during the General Assembly:\\r\\n IPC President Sir Philip Craven\\r\\nThe co-operation agreement outlined the strong partnership between the IPC and the CGF. It recognized the IPC as the organization for overseeing the co-ordination and delivery of the Commonwealth Games EAD sports programme and committed both organizations to work together in supporting the growth of the Paralympic and Commonwealth Games Movements.[39]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Winter Games were a multi-sport event comprising winter sports, last held in 1966. Three editions of the Games have been staged. The Winter Games were designed as a counterbalance to the Commonwealth Games, which focuses on summer sports, to accompany the Winter Olympics and Summer Olympic Games. The winter Games were founded by T.D. Richardson.[40] The 1958 Commonwealth Winter Games were held in St. Moritz, Switzerland and was the inaugural games for the winter edition.[41][42] The 1962 Games were also held in St. Moritz, complementing the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Australia, and the 1966 event was held in St. Moritz as well, following which the idea was discontinued.[43]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Youth Games are an international multi-sport event organized by the Commonwealth Games Federation. The games are held every four years with the current Commonwealth Games format. The Commonwealth Games Federation discussed the idea of a Millennium Commonwealth Youth Games in 1997. In 1998 the concept was agreed on for the purpose of providing a Commonwealth multi-sport event for young people born in the calendar year 1986 or later. The first version was held in Edinburgh, Scotland from 10 to 14 August 2000. The age limitation of the athletes is 14 to 18.[44]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) is the international organisation responsible for the direction and control of the Commonwealth Games and Commonwealth Youth Games, and is the foremost authority in matters relating to the games.[45] The Commonwealth House in London, United Kingdom hosts the headquarters of CGF.[46] The Commonwealth House also hosts the headquarters of the Royal Commonwealth Society and the Commonwealth Local Government Forum.[47][48]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Games Movement is made of three major elements:\\r\\nEnglish is the official language of the Commonwealth. The other language used at each Commonwealth Games is the language of the host country (or languages, if a country has more than one official language apart from English). Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these two (or more) languages, or the main depending on whether the host country is an English speaking country.\\r\\nThe Queen's Baton Relay, is a relay around the world held prior to the beginning of the Commonwealth Games. The Baton carries a message from the Head of the Commonwealth, currently Queen Elizabeth II. The Relay traditionally begins at Buckingham Palace in London as a part of the city's Commonwealth Day festivities. The Queen entrusts the baton to the first relay runner. At the Opening Ceremony of the Games, the final relay runner hands the baton back to the Queen or her representative, who reads the message aloud to officially open the Games.The Queen's Baton Relay is similar to the Olympic Torch Relay.[51]\\r\\nThe Relay was introduced at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, Wales. Up until, and including, the 1994 Games, the Relay only went through England and the host nation. The Relay for the 1998 Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia was the first to travel to other nations of the Commonwealth. The Gold Coast 2018 Queens Baton Relay was the longest in Commonwealth Games history. Covering 230,000?km over 388 days, the Baton made its way through the six Commonwealth regions of Africa, the Americas, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia and Oceania. For the first time, the Queen's Baton was presented at the Commonwealth Youth Games during its sixth edition in 2017 which were held in Nassau, Bahamas.[52]\\r\\nVarious elements frame the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred. The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem. The flag of the Commonwealth Games Federation, flag of the last hosting nation and the next hosting nation are also hosted during the opening ceremony. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance and theatre representative of its culture. The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Delhi Games reportedly cost $70?million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment.[53]\\r\\nAfter the artistic portion of the ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. The last hosting nation is traditionally the first nation to enter. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetical or continental wise with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. Speeches are given, formally opening the Games. Finally, the Queen's Baton is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final baton carrier, often a successful Commonwealth athlete from the host nation, who hands it over to the Head of the Commonwealth or their representative.\\r\\nThe closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction. The president of the organizing committee and the CGF president make their closing speeches and the Games are officially closed. The CGF president also speaks about the conduct of the games. The mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers the CGF flag to the president of the CGF, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Commonwealth Games. The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture. Many great artists and singers had performed at the ceremonies of the Commonwealth Games.\\r\\nAt the closing ceremony of every Commonwealth Games the CGF President makes an award and presents a trophy to one athlete who has competed with particular distinction and honour both in terms of athletic performance and overall contribution to his or her team. Athletes are nominated by their Commonwealth Games Association at the end of the final day of competition and the winner is selected by a panel comprising the CGF President and representatives from each of the six Commonwealth Regions. The David Dixon Award as it is called was introduced in Manchester 2002, after the late David Dixon, former Honorary Secretary of the CGF, in honour of his monumental contribution to Commonwealth sport for many years.[54]\\r\\nA medal ceremony is held after each event is concluded. The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals. After the medals are given out by a CGF member, the national flags of the three medallists are raised while the national anthem of the gold medallist's country plays. Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers.\\r\\nNote: The 1911 Inter-Empire Championships held in London is seen as a precursor to the modern Commonwealth Games, but is not normally considered an official edition of the Games themselves. Also, the United Kingdom competed as one country, unlike the Commonwealth Games today when they compete as England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Canada topped the medal table by winning 4 events.[56]\\r\\nBelow is a Top 10 all-time medal table.\\r\\nThere are a total of 22 sports (with three multi-disciplinary sports) and a further seven para-sports which are approved by the Commonwealth Games Federation. Core sports must be included on each programme. A number of optional sports may be picked by the host nation, which may include some team sports such as basketball.\\r\\nIn 2015, the Commonwealth Games Federation agreed large changes to the programme which increased the number of core sports, whilst removing a number of optionals, those removed are listed below. [59]\\r\\nRecognised sports are sports which have been approved by the Commonwealth Games Federation but which are deemed to need expansion; host nations may not pick these sports for their programme until the Federation's requirements are fulfilled.[61]\\r\\nOnly six teams have attended every Commonwealth Games: Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, Scotland and Wales. Australia has been the highest scoring team for twelve games, England for seven and Canada for one.\\r\\n??Participated ??Withdrew for political reason ??Not eligible to participate ??To be determined\\r\\nVery few Commonwealth dependencies and nations have yet to take part:[65][66]\\r\\nThe 1934 British Empire Games, originally awarded in 1930 to Johannesburg was moved to London after South Africa's pre-apartheid government refused to allow nonwhite participants.[68]\\r\\nThe 2022 Commonwealth Games were originally awarded to Durban on 2 September 2015, at the CGF General Assembly in Auckland.[69] It was reported in February 2017 that Durban may be unable to host the games due to financial constraints. On 13 March 2017, the CGF stripped Durban of their rights to host and reopened the bidding process for the 2022 games.[70] Many cities from Australia, Canada, England and Malaysia expressed interest to host the games. However, the CGF received only one official bid and that was from Birmingham, England.[71] On 21 December 2017, Birmingham was awarded for the 2022 Games as Durban's replacement host.[72]\\r\\nNigeria boycotted the 1978 Commonwealth Games at Edmonton in protest of New Zealand's sporting contacts with apartheid-era South Africa. Uganda also stayed away, in protest of alleged Canadian hostility towards the government of Idi Amin.[19][73]\\r\\nDuring the 1986 Commonwealth Games at Edinburgh, a majority of the Commonwealth nations staged a boycott, so that the Games appeared to be a whites-only event. Thirty two of the eligible fifty nine countrieslargely African, Asian and Caribbean statesstayed away because of the Thatcher government's policy of keeping Britain's sporting links with apartheid South Africa in preference to participating in the general sporting boycott of that country. Consequently, Edinburgh 1986 witnessed the lowest number of athletes since Auckland 1950.[74] The boycotting nations were Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Bermuda, Belize, Cyprus, Dominica, Gambia, Ghana, Guyana, Grenada, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sierra Leone, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, Mauritius, Trinidad and Tobago, Tanzania, Turks and Caicos Islands, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.[75] Bermuda was a particularly late withdrawal, as its athletes appeared in the opening ceremony and in the opening day of competition before the Bermuda Olympic Association decided to formally withdraw.[76]\\r\\nThe estimated cost of the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi were US$ 11 billion, according to Business Today magazine.[77] The initial total budget estimated by the Indian Olympic Association in 2003 was US$ 250 million. In 2010, however, the official total budget soon escalated to an estimated US$ 1.8 billion, a figure which excluded non-sports-related infrastructure development.[78] The 2010 Commonwealth Games are reportedly the most expensive Commonwealth Games ever.[79]\\r\\nLawn bowler Willie Wood from Scotland was the first competitor to have competed in seven Commonwealth Games, from 1974 to 2002, a record equalled in 2014 by Isle of Man cyclist Andrew Roche.[80]\\r\\nThey have both been surpassed by David Calvert of Northern Ireland who in 2018 attended his 11th games.[81]\\r\\nGreg Yelavich, a sports shooter from New Zealand, has won 12 medals in seven games from 1986 to 2010.\\r\\nLawn Bowler Robert Weale has represented Wales in 8 Commonwealth Games, 1986ÿ2014, winning 2 gold, 3 silver and 1 bronze.\\r\\nNauruan weightlifter Marcus Stephen won twelve medals at the Games between 1990 and 2002, of which seven gold, and was elected President of Nauru in 2007. His performance has helped place Nauru (the smallest independent state in the Commonwealth, at 21?km2 and with a population of fewer than 9,400 in 2011) in nineteenth place on the all-time Commonwealth Games medal table.\\r\\nIan Thorpe, Australian swimmer (now retired), has won 10 Commonwealth Games gold medals and 1 silver medal. At the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, he won 4 gold medals. At the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, he won 6 gold medals and 1 silver medal.[82]\\r\\nChad le Clos, South Africas most decorated swimmer, has won 17 medals from just three Commonwealth Games (2010, 2014 & 2018), seven of which are gold. At the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, he won three golds, a silver and a bronze.[83]","input":"How many countries are there in commonwealth games?"},{"output":"red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet","context":"A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky. It takes the form of a multicoloured circular arc. Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the sun.\\r\\nRainbows can be full circles. However, the observer normally sees only an arc formed by illuminated droplets above the ground,[1] and centered on a line from the sun to the observer's eye.\\r\\nIn a primary rainbow, the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side. This rainbow is caused by light being refracted when entering a droplet of water, then reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it.\\r\\nIn a double rainbow, a second arc is seen outside the primary arc, and has the order of its colors reversed, with red on the inner side of the arc. This is caused by the light being reflected twice on the inside of the droplet before leaving it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA rainbow is not located at a specific distance from the observer, but comes from an optical illusion caused by any water droplets viewed from a certain angle relative to a light source. Thus, a rainbow is not an object and cannot be physically approached. Indeed, it is impossible for an observer to see a rainbow from water droplets at any angle other than the customary one of 42 degrees from the direction opposite the light source. Even if an observer sees another observer who seems \\"under\\" or \\"at the end of\\" a rainbow, the second observer will see a different rainbowfarther offat the same angle as seen by the first observer.\\r\\nRainbows span a continuous spectrum of colours. Any distinct bands perceived are an artefact of human colour vision, and no banding of any type is seen in a black-and-white photo of a rainbow, only a smooth gradation of intensity to a maximum, then fading towards the other side. For colours seen by the human eye, the most commonly cited and remembered sequence is Newton's sevenfold red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet,[2][3] remembered by the mnemonic, Richard Of York Gave Battle In Vain (ROYGBIV).\\r\\nRainbows can be caused by many forms of airborne water. These include not only rain, but also mist, spray, and airborne dew.\\r\\nRainbows can be observed whenever there are water drops in the air and sunlight shining from behind the observer at a low altitude angle. Because of this, rainbows are usually seen in the western sky during the morning and in the eastern sky during the early evening. The most spectacular rainbow displays happen when half the sky is still dark with raining clouds and the observer is at a spot with clear sky in the direction of the sun. The result is a luminous rainbow that contrasts with the darkened background. During such good visibility conditions, the larger but fainter secondary rainbow is often visible. It appears about 10 outside of the primary rainbow, with inverse order of colours.\\r\\nThe rainbow effect is also commonly seen near waterfalls or fountains. In addition, the effect can be artificially created by dispersing water droplets into the air during a sunny day. Rarely, a moonbow, lunar rainbow or nighttime rainbow, can be seen on strongly moonlit nights. As human visual perception for colour is poor in low light, moonbows are often perceived to be white.[4]\\r\\nIt is difficult to photograph the complete semicircle of a rainbow in one frame, as this would require an angle of view of 84. For a 35?mm camera, a wide-angle lens with a focal length of 19?mm or less would be required. Now that software for stitching several images into a panorama is available, images of the entire arc and even secondary arcs can be created fairly easily from a series of overlapping frames.\\r\\nFrom above the earth such as in an aeroplane, it is sometimes possible to see a rainbow as a full circle. This phenomenon can be confused with the glory phenomenon, but a glory is usually much smaller, covering only 5ÿ20.\\r\\nThe sky inside a primary rainbow is brighter than the sky outside of the bow. This is because each raindrop is a sphere and it scatters light over an entire circular disc in the sky. The radius of the disc depends on the wavelength of light, with red light being scattered over a larger angle than blue light. Over most of the disc, scattered light at all wavelengths overlaps, resulting in white light which brightens the sky. At the edge, the wavelength dependence of the scattering gives rise to the rainbow.[5]\\r\\nLight of primary rainbow arc is 96% polarised tangential to the arch.[6] Light of second arc is 90% polarised.\\r\\nA spectrum obtained using a glass prism and a point source is a continuum of wavelengths without bands. The number of colours that the human eye is able to distinguish in a spectrum is in the order of 100.[7] Accordingly, the Munsell colour system (a 20th-century system for numerically describing colours, based on equal steps for human visual perception) distinguishes 100 hues. The apparent discreteness of main colours is an artefact of human perception and the exact number of main colours is a somewhat arbitrary choice.\\r\\nNewton, who admitted his eyes were not very critical in distinguishing colours,[8] originally (1672) divided the spectrum into five main colours: red, yellow, green, blue and violet. Later he included orange and indigo, giving seven main colours by analogy to the number of notes in a musical scale.[2][9] Newton chose to divide the visible spectrum into seven colours out of a belief derived from the beliefs of the ancient Greek sophists, who thought there was a connection between the colours, the musical notes, the known objects in the Solar System, and the days of the week.[10][11][12]\\r\\nAccording to Isaac Asimov, \\"It is customary to list indigo as a color lying between blue and violet, but it has never seemed to me that indigo is worth the dignity of being considered a separate color. To my eyes it seems merely deep blue.\\"[13]\\r\\nThe colour pattern of a rainbow is different from a spectrum, and the colours are less saturated. There is spectral smearing in a rainbow owing to the fact that for any particular wavelength, there is a distribution of exit angles, rather than a single unvarying angle.[14] In addition, a rainbow is a blurred version of the bow obtained from a point source, because the disk diameter of the sun (0.5) cannot be neglected compared to the width of a rainbow (2). The number of colour bands of a rainbow may therefore be different from the number of bands in a spectrum, especially if the droplets are particularly large or small. Therefore, the number of colours of a rainbow is variable. If, however, the word rainbow is used inaccurately to mean spectrum, it is the number of main colours in the spectrum.\\r\\nThe question of whether everyone sees seven colours in a rainbow is related to the idea of Linguistic relativity. Suggestions have been made that there is universality in the way that a rainbow is perceived.[15][16] However, more recent research suggests that the number of distinct colours observed and what these are called depend on the language that one uses with people whose language has fewer colour words seeing fewer discrete colour bands.[17]\\r\\nWhen sunlight encounters a raindrop, part of the light is reflected and the rest enters the raindrop. The light is refracted at the surface of the raindrop. When this light hits the back of the raindrop, some of it is reflected off the back. When the internally reflected light reaches the surface again, once more some is internally reflected and some is refracted as it exits the drop. (The light that reflects off the drop, exits from the back, or continues to bounce around inside the drop after the second encounter with the surface, is not relevant to the formation of the primary rainbow.) The overall effect is that part of the incoming light is reflected back over the range of 0 to 42, with the most intense light at 42.[18] This angle is independent of the size of the drop, but does depend on its refractive index. Seawater has a higher refractive index than rain water, so the radius of a \\"rainbow\\" in sea spray is smaller than a true rainbow. This is visible to the naked eye by a misalignment of these bows.[19]\\r\\nThe reason the returning light is most intense at about 42 is that this is a turning point ÿ light hitting the outermost ring of the drop gets returned at less than 42, as does the light hitting the drop nearer to its centre. There is a circular band of light that all gets returned right around 42. If the sun were a laser emitting parallel, monochromatic rays, then the luminance (brightness) of the bow would tend toward infinity at this angle (ignoring interference effects). (See Caustic (optics).) But since the sun's luminance is finite and its rays are not all parallel (it covers about half a degree of the sky) the luminance does not go to infinity. Furthermore, the amount by which light is refracted depends upon its wavelength, and hence its colour. This effect is called dispersion. Blue light (shorter wavelength) is refracted at a greater angle than red light, but due to the reflection of light rays from the back of the droplet, the blue light emerges from the droplet at a smaller angle to the original incident white light ray than the red light. Due to this angle, blue is seen on the inside of the arc of the primary rainbow, and red on the outside. The result of this is not only to give different colours to different parts of the rainbow, but also to diminish the brightness. (A \\"rainbow\\" formed by droplets of a liquid with no dispersion would be white, but brighter than a normal rainbow.)\\r\\nThe light at the back of the raindrop does not undergo total internal reflection, and some light does emerge from the back. However, light coming out the back of the raindrop does not create a rainbow between the observer and the sun because spectra emitted from the back of the raindrop do not have a maximum of intensity, as the other visible rainbows do, and thus the colours blend together rather than forming a rainbow.[20]\\r\\nA rainbow does not exist at one particular location. Many rainbows exist; however, only one can be seen depending on the particular observer's viewpoint as droplets of light illuminated by the sun. All raindrops refract and reflect the sunlight in the same way, but only the light from some raindrops reaches the observer's eye. This light is what constitutes the rainbow for that observer. The whole system composed by the sun's rays, the observer's head, and the (spherical) water drops has an axial symmetry around the axis through the observer's head and parallel to the sun's rays. The rainbow is curved because the set of all the raindrops that have the right angle between the observer, the drop, and the sun, lie on a cone pointing at the sun with the observer at the tip. The base of the cone forms a circle at an angle of 40ÿ42 to the line between the observer's head and their shadow but 50% or more of the circle is below the horizon, unless the observer is sufficiently far above the earth's surface to see it all, for example in an aeroplane (see above).[21][22] Alternatively, an observer with the right vantage point may see the full circle in a fountain or waterfall spray.[23]\\r\\nWe can determine the perceived angle which the rainbow subtends as follows.[24]\\r\\nGiven a spherical raindrop, and defining the perceived angle of the rainbow as 2, and the angle of the internal reflection as 2, then the angle of incidence of the sun's rays with respect to the drop's surface normal is 2 ? . Since the angle of refraction is , Snell's law gives us\\r\\nwhere n = 1.333 is the refractive index of water. Solving for , we get\\r\\nThe rainbow will occur where the angle  is maximum with respect to the angle . Therefore, from calculus, we can set d/d = 0, and solve for , which yields\\r\\nSubstituting back into the earlier equation for  yields 2max  42 as the radius angle of the rainbow.\\r\\nSecondary rainbows are caused by a double reflection of sunlight inside the raindrops, and are centred on the sun itself. They are about 127 (violet) to 130 (red) wide. Since this is more than 90, they are seen on the same side of the sky as the primary rainbow, about 10 above it at apparent angles of 50ÿ53. As a result of the \\"inside\\" of the secondary bow being \\"up\\" to the observer, the colours appear reversed compared to the primary bow. The secondary rainbow is fainter than the primary because more light escapes from two reflections compared to one and because the rainbow itself is spread over a greater area of the sky. Each rainbow reflects white light inside its coloured bands, but that is \\"down\\" for the primary and \\"up\\" for the secondary.[25] The dark area of unlit sky lying between the primary and secondary bows is called Alexander's band, after Alexander of Aphrodisias who first described it.[26]\\r\\nUnlike a double rainbow that consists of two separate and concentric rainbow arcs, the very rare twinned rainbow appears as two rainbow arcs that split from a single base.[27] The colours in the second bow, rather than reversing as in a secondary rainbow, appear in the same order as the primary rainbow. A \\"normal\\" secondary rainbow may be present as well. Twinned rainbows can look similar to, but should not be confused with supernumerary bands. The two phenomena may be told apart by their difference in colour profile: supernumerary bands consist of subdued pastel hues (mainly pink, purple and green), while the twinned rainbow shows the same spectrum as a regular rainbow. The cause of a twinned rainbow is the combination of different sizes of water drops falling from the sky. Due to air resistance, raindrops flatten as they fall, and flattening is more prominent in larger water drops. When two rain showers with different-sized raindrops combine, they each produce slightly different rainbows which may combine and form a twinned rainbow.[28] A numerical ray tracing study showed that a twinned rainbow on a photo could be explained by a mixture of 0.40 and 0.45?mm droplets. That small difference in droplet size resulted in a small difference in flattening of the droplet shape, and a large difference in flattening of the rainbow top.[29]\\r\\nMeanwhile, the even rarer case of a rainbow split into three branches was observed and photographed in nature.[30]\\r\\nIn theory, every rainbow is a circle, but from the ground, only its upper half can be seen. Since the rainbow's centre is diametrically opposed to the sun's position in the sky, more of the circle comes into view as the sun approaches the horizon, meaning that the largest section of the circle normally seen is about 50% during sunset or sunrise. Viewing the rainbow's lower half requires the presence of water droplets below the observer's horizon, as well as sunlight that is able to reach them. These requirements are not usually met when the viewer is at ground level, either because droplets are absent in the required position, or because the sunlight is obstructed by the landscape behind the observer. From a high viewpoint such as a high building or an aircraft, however, the requirements can be met and the full-circle rainbow can be seen.[31][32] Like a partial rainbow, the circular rainbow can have a secondary bow or supernumerary bows as well.[33] It is possible to produce the full circle when standing on the ground, for example by spraying a water mist from a garden hose while facing away from the sun.[34]\\r\\nA circular rainbow should not be confused with the glory, which is much smaller in diameter and is created by different optical processes. In the right circumstances, a glory and a (circular) rainbow or fog bow can occur together. Another atmospheric phenomenon that may be mistaken for a \\"circular rainbow\\" is the 22 halo, which is caused by ice crystals rather than liquid water droplets, and is located around the sun (or moon), not opposite it.\\r\\nIn certain circumstances, one or several narrow, faintly coloured bands can be seen bordering the violet edge of a rainbow; i.e., inside the primary bow or, much more rarely, outside the secondary. These extra bands are called supernumerary rainbows or supernumerary bands; together with the rainbow itself the phenomenon is also known as a stacker rainbow. The supernumerary bows are slightly detached from the main bow, become successively fainter along with their distance from it, and have pastel colours (consisting mainly of pink, purple and green hues) rather than the usual spectrum pattern.[35] The effect becomes apparent when water droplets are involved that have a diameter of about 1?mm or less; the smaller the droplets are, the broader the supernumerary bands become, and the less saturated their colours.[36] Due to their origin in small droplets, supernumerary bands tend to be particularly prominent in fogbows.[37]\\r\\nSupernumerary rainbows cannot be explained using classical geometric optics. The alternating faint bands are caused by interference between rays of light following slightly different paths with slightly varying lengths within the raindrops. Some rays are in phase, reinforcing each other through constructive interference, creating a bright band; others are out of phase by up to half a wavelength, cancelling each other out through destructive interference, and creating a gap. Given the different angles of refraction for rays of different colours, the patterns of interference are slightly different for rays of different colours, so each bright band is differentiated in colour, creating a miniature rainbow. Supernumerary rainbows are clearest when raindrops are small and of uniform size. The very existence of supernumerary rainbows was historically a first indication of the wave nature of light, and the first explanation was provided by Thomas Young in 1804.[38]\\r\\nWhen a rainbow appears above a body of water, two complementary mirror bows may be seen below and above the horizon, originating from different light paths. Their names are slightly different.\\r\\nA reflected rainbow may appear in the water surface below the horizon.[39] The sunlight is first deflected by the raindrops, and then reflected off the body of water, before reaching the observer. The reflected rainbow is frequently visible, at least partially, even in small puddles.\\r\\nA reflection rainbow may be produced where sunlight reflects off a body of water before reaching the raindrops (see diagram and [1]), if the water body is large, quiet over its entire surface, and close to the rain curtain. The reflection rainbow appears above the horizon. It intersects the normal rainbow at the horizon, and its arc reaches higher in the sky, with its centre as high above the horizon as the normal rainbow's centre is below it. Due to the combination of requirements, a reflection rainbow is rarely visible.\\r\\nUp to eight separate bows may be distinguished if the reflected and reflection rainbows happen to occur simultaneously: The normal (non-reflection) primary and secondary bows above the horizon (1, 2) with their reflected counterparts below it (3, 4), and the reflection primary and secondary bows above the horizon (5, 6) with their reflected counterparts below it (7, 8).[40][41]\\r\\nOccasionally a shower may happen at sunrise or sunset, where the shorter wavelengths like blue and green have been scattered and essentially removed from the spectrum. Further scattering may occur due to the rain, and the result can be the rare and dramatic monochrome or red rainbow.[42]\\r\\nIn addition to the common primary and secondary rainbows, it is also possible for rainbows of higher orders to form. The order of a rainbow is determined by the number of light reflections inside the water droplets that create it: One reflection results in the first-order or primary rainbow; two reflections create the second-order or secondary rainbow. More internal reflections cause bows of higher orderstheoretically unto infinity.[43] As more and more light is lost with each internal reflection, however, each subsequent bow becomes progressively dimmer and therefore increasingly harder to spot. An additional challenge in observing the third-order (or tertiary) and fourth-order (quaternary) rainbows is their location in the direction of the sun (about 40 and 45 from the sun, respectively), causing them to become drowned in its glare.[44]\\r\\nFor these reasons, naturally occurring rainbows of an order higher than 2 are rarely visible to the naked eye. Nevertheless, sightings of the third-order bow in nature have been reported, and in 2011 it was photographed definitively for the first time.[45][46] Shortly after, the fourth-order rainbow was photographed as well,[47][48] and in 2014 the first ever pictures of the fifth-order (or quinary) rainbow, located in between the primary and secondary bows, were published.[49]\\r\\nIn a laboratory setting, it is possible to create bows of much higher orders. Felix Billet (1808ÿ1882) depicted angular positions up to the 19th-order rainbow, a pattern he called a \\"rose of rainbows\\".[50][51][52] In the laboratory, it is possible to observe higher-order rainbows by using extremely bright and well collimated light produced by lasers. Up to the 200th-order rainbow was reported by Ng et al. in 1998 using a similar method but an argon ion laser beam.[53]\\r\\nTertiary and quaternary rainbows should not be confused with \\"triple\\" and \\"quadruple\\" rainbowsterms sometimes erroneously used to refer to themuch more commonsupernumerary bows and reflection rainbows.\\r\\nLike most atmospheric optical phenomena, rainbows can be caused by light from the Sun, but also from the Moon. In case of the latter, the rainbow is referred to as a lunar rainbow or moonbow. They are much dimmer and rarer than solar rainbows, requiring the Moon to be near-full in order for them to be seen. For the same reason, moonbows are often perceived as white and may be thought of as monochrome. The full spectrum is present, however, but the human eye is not normally sensitive enough to see the colours. Long exposure photographs will sometimes show the colour in this type of rainbow.[54]\\r\\nFogbows form in the same way as rainbows, but they are formed by much smaller cloud and fog droplets that diffract light extensively. They are almost white with faint reds on the outside and blues inside; often one or more broad supernumerary bands can be discerned inside the inner edge. The colours are dim because the bow in each colour is very broad and the colours overlap. Fogbows are commonly seen over water when air in contact with the cooler water is chilled, but they can be found anywhere if the fog is thin enough for the sun to shine through and the sun is fairly bright. They are very largealmost as big as a rainbow and much broader. They sometimes appear with a glory at the bow's centre.[55]\\r\\nFog bows should not be confused with ice halos, which are very common around the world and visible much more often than rainbows (of any order),[56] yet are unrelated to rainbows.\\r\\nThe circumzenithal and circumhorizontal arcs are two related optical phenomena similar in appearance to a rainbow, but unlike the latter, their origin lies in light refraction through hexagonal ice crystals rather than liquid water droplets. This means that they are not rainbows, but members of the large family of halos.\\r\\nBoth arcs are brightly coloured ring segments centred on the zenith, but in different positions in the sky: The circumzenithal arc is notably curved and located high above the Sun (or Moon) with its convex side pointing downwards (creating the impression of an \\"upside down rainbow\\"); the circumhorizontal arc runs much closer to the horizon, is more straight and located at a significant distance below the Sun (or Moon). Both arcs have their red side pointing towards the sun and their violet part away from it, meaning the circumzenithal arc is red on the bottom, while the circumhorizontal arc is red on top.[57][58]\\r\\nThe circumhorizontal arc is sometimes referred to by the misnomer \\"fire rainbow\\". In order to view it, the Sun or Moon must be at least 58 above the horizon, making it a rare occurrence at higher latitudes. The circumzenithal arc, visible only at a solar or lunar elevation of less than 32, is much more common, but often missed since it occurs almost directly overhead.\\r\\nIt has been suggested that rainbows might exist on Saturn's moon Titan, as it has a wet surface and humid clouds. The radius of a Titan rainbow would be about 49 instead of 42, because the fluid in that cold environment is methane instead of water. Although visible rainbows may be rare due to Titan's hazy skies, infrared rainbows may be more common, but an observer would need infrared night vision goggles to see them.[59]\\r\\nDroplets (or spheres) composed of materials with different refractive indices than plain water produce rainbows with different radius angles. Since salt water has a higher refractive index, a sea spray bow doesn't perfectly align with the ordinary rainbow, if seen at the same spot.[60] Tiny plastic or glass marbles may be used in road marking as a reflectors to enhance its visibility by drivers at night. Due to a much higher refractive index, rainbows observed on such marbles have a noticeably smaller radius.[61] One can easily reproduce such phenomena by sprinkling liquids of different refractive indices in the air, as illustrated in the photo.\\r\\nThe displacement of the rainbow due to different refractive indices can be pushed to a peculiar limit. For a material with a refractive index larger than 2, there is no angle fulfilling the requirements for the first order rainbow. For example, the index of refraction of diamond is about 2.4, so diamond spheres would produce rainbows starting from the second order, omitting the first order. In general, as the refractive index exceeds a number n+1, where n is a natural number, the critical incidence angle for n times internally reflected rays escapes the domain \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[\\r\\n0\\r\\n,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle [0,{\\\\frac {\\\\pi }{2}}]}\\r\\n\\r\\n. This results in a rainbow of the n-th order shrinking to the antisolar point and vanishing.\\r\\nThe classical Greek scholar Aristotle (384ÿ322 BC) was first to devote serious attention to the rainbow.[62] According to Raymond L. Lee and Alistair B. Fraser, \\"Despite its many flaws and its appeal to Pythagorean numerology, Aristotle's qualitative explanation showed an inventiveness and relative consistency that was unmatched for centuries. After Aristotle's death, much rainbow theory consisted of reaction to his work, although not all of this was uncritical.\\"[63]\\r\\nIn Book I of Naturales Quaestiones (c. 65 AD), the Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger discusses various theories of the formation of rainbows extensively, including those of Aristotle. He notices that rainbows appear always opposite to the sun, that they appear in water sprayed by a rower, in the water spat by a fuller on clothes stretched on pegs or by water sprayed through a small hole in a burst pipe. He even speaks of rainbows produced by small rods (virgulae) of glass, anticipating Newton's experiences with prisms. He takes into account two theories: one, that the rainbow is produced by the sun reflecting in each water drop, the other, that it is produced by the sun reflected in a cloud shaped like a concave mirror; he favours the latter. He also discusses other phenomena related to rainbows: the mysterious \\"virgae\\" (rods), halos and parhelia.[64]\\r\\nAccording to Hseyin Gazi Topdemir, the Persian physicist and polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen; 965ÿ1039), attempted to provide a scientific explanation for the rainbow phenomenon. In his Maqala fi al-Hala wa Qaws Quzah (On the Rainbow and Halo), al-Haytham \\"explained the formation of rainbow as an image, which forms at a concave mirror. If the rays of light coming from a farther light source reflect to any point on axis of the concave mirror, they form concentric circles in that point. When it is supposed that the sun as a farther light source, the eye of viewer as a point on the axis of mirror and a cloud as a reflecting surface, then it can be observed the concentric circles are forming on the axis.\\"[65] He was not able to verify this because his theory that \\"light from the sun is reflected by a cloud before reaching the eye\\" did not allow for a possible experimental verification.[66] This explanation was later repeated by Averroes,[65] and, though incorrect, provided the groundwork for the correct explanations later given by Kaml al-Dؐn al-Frisؐ (1267ÿ1319) and Theodoric of Freiberg (c.1250ÿ1310).[67]\\r\\nIbn al-Haytham's contemporary, the Persian philosopher and polymath Ibn Sؐn (Avicenna; 980ÿ1037), provided an alternative explanation, writing \\"that the bow is not formed in the dark cloud but rather in the very thin mist lying between the cloud and the sun or observer. The cloud, he thought, serves simply as the background of this thin substance, much as a quicksilver lining is placed upon the rear surface of the glass in a mirror. Ibn Sؐn would change the place not only of the bow, but also of the colour formation, holding the iridescence to be merely a subjective sensation in the eye.\\"[68] This explanation, however, was also incorrect.[65] Ibn Sؐn's account accepts many of Aristotle's arguments on the rainbow.[69]\\r\\nIn Song Dynasty China (960ÿ1279), a polymath scholar-official named Shen Kuo (1031ÿ1095) hypothesisedas a certain Sun Sikong (1015ÿ1076) did before himthat rainbows were formed by a phenomenon of sunlight encountering droplets of rain in the air.[70] Paul Dong writes that Shen's explanation of the rainbow as a phenomenon of atmospheric refraction \\"is basically in accord with modern scientific principles.\\"[71]\\r\\nAccording to Nader El-Bizri, the Persian astronomer, Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (1236ÿ1311), gave a fairly accurate explanation for the rainbow phenomenon. This was elaborated on by his student, Kaml al-Dؐn al-Frisؐ (1267ÿ1319), who gave a more mathematically satisfactory explanation of the rainbow. He \\"proposed a model where the ray of light from the sun was refracted twice by a water droplet, one or more reflections occurring between the two refractions.\\" An experiment with a water-filled glass sphere was conducted and al-Farisi showed the additional refractions due to the glass could be ignored in his model.[66] As he noted in his Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir (The Revision of the Optics), al-Farisi used a large clear vessel of glass in the shape of a sphere, which was filled with water, in order to have an experimental large-scale model of a rain drop. He then placed this model within a camera obscura that has a controlled aperture for the introduction of light. He projected light unto the sphere and ultimately deduced through several trials and detailed observations of reflections and refractions of light that the colours of the rainbow are phenomena of the decomposition of light.\\r\\nIn Europe, Ibn al-Haytham's Book of Optics was translated into Latin and studied by Robert Grosseteste. His work on light was continued by Roger Bacon, who wrote in his Opus Majus of 1268 about experiments with light shining through crystals and water droplets showing the colours of the rainbow.[72] In addition, Bacon was the first to calculate the angular size of the rainbow. He stated that the rainbow summit can not appear higher than 42 above the horizon.[73] Theodoric of Freiberg is known to have given an accurate theoretical explanation of both the primary and secondary rainbows in 1307. He explained the primary rainbow, noting that \\"when sunlight falls on individual drops of moisture, the rays undergo two refractions (upon ingress and egress) and one reflection (at the back of the drop) before transmission into the eye of the observer.\\"[74][75] He explained the secondary rainbow through a similar analysis involving two refractions and two reflections.\\r\\nDescartes' 1637 treatise, Discourse on Method, further advanced this explanation. Knowing that the size of raindrops did not appear to affect the observed rainbow, he experimented with passing rays of light through a large glass sphere filled with water. By measuring the angles that the rays emerged, he concluded that the primary bow was caused by a single internal reflection inside the raindrop and that a secondary bow could be caused by two internal reflections. He supported this conclusion with a derivation of the law of refraction (subsequently to, but independently of, Snell) and correctly calculated the angles for both bows. His explanation of the colours, however, was based on a mechanical version of the traditional theory that colours were produced by a modification of white light.[76][77]\\r\\nIsaac Newton demonstrated that white light was composed of the light of all the colours of the rainbow, which a glass prism could separate into the full spectrum of colours, rejecting the theory that the colours were produced by a modification of white light. He also showed that red light is refracted less than blue light, which led to the first scientific explanation of the major features of the rainbow.[78] Newton's corpuscular theory of light was unable to explain supernumerary rainbows, and a satisfactory explanation was not found until Thomas Young realised that light behaves as a wave under certain conditions, and can interfere with itself.\\r\\nYoung's work was refined in the 1820s by George Biddell Airy, who explained the dependence of the strength of the colours of the rainbow on the size of the water droplets.[79] Modern physical descriptions of the rainbow are based on Mie scattering, work published by Gustav Mie in 1908.[80] Advances in computational methods and optical theory continue to lead to a fuller understanding of rainbows. For example, Nussenzveig provides a modern overview.[81]\\r\\nExperiments on the rainbow phenomenon using artificial raindrops, i.e. water-filled spherical flasks, go back at least to Theodoric of Freiberg in the 14th century. Later, also Descartes studied the phenomenon using a Florence flask. A flask experiment known as Florence's rainbow is still often used today as an imposing and intuitively accessible demonstration experiment of the rainbow phenomenon.[82][83][84] It consists in illuminating (with parallel white light) a water-filled spherical flask through a hole in a screen. A rainbow will then appear thrown back / projected on the screen, provided the screen is large enough. Due to the finite wall thickness and the macroscopic character of the artificial raindrop, several subtle differences exist as compared to the natural phenomenon,[85][86] including slightly changed rainbow angles and a splitting of the rainbow orders.\\r\\nA very similar experiment consists in using a cylindrical glass vessel filled with water or a solid transparent cylinder and illuminated either parallel to the circular base (i.e. light rays remaining at a fixed height while they transit the cylinder)[87][88] or under an angle to the base. Under these latter conditions the rainbow angles change relative to the natural phenomenon since the effective index of refraction of water changes (Bravais' index of refraction for inclined rays applies).[85][86]\\r\\nOther experiments use small liquid drops,[51][52] see text above.\\r\\nRainbows occur frequently in mythology, and have been used in the arts. One of the earliest literary occurrences of a rainbow is in the Book of Genesis chapter 9, as part of the flood story of Noah, where it is a sign of God's covenant to never destroy all life on earth with a global flood again. In Norse mythology, the rainbow bridge Bifr?st connects the world of men (Midgard) and the realm of the gods (Asgard). Cuchavira was the god of the rainbow for the Muisca in present-day Colombia and when the regular rains on the Bogot savanna were over, the people thanked him offering gold, snails and small emeralds. The Irish leprechaun's secret hiding place for his pot of gold is usually said to be at the end of the rainbow. This place is appropriately impossible to reach, because the rainbow is an optical effect which cannot be approached.\\r\\nRainbows sometimes appear in heraldry too, even if its characteristic of multiple colours doesn't really fit into the usual heraldic style.\\r\\nRainbow flags have been used for centuries. It was a symbol of the Cooperative movement in the German Peasants' War in the 16th century, of peace in Italy, and of gay pride and LGBT social movements since the 1970s. In 1994, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and President Nelson Mandela described newly democratic post-apartheid South Africa as the rainbow nation. The rainbow has even been used in technology product logos including the Apple computer logo.[89] Many political alliances spanning multiple political parties have called themselves a \\"Rainbow Coalition\\".\\r\\nEruption of Castle Geyser, Yellowstone National Park, with double rainbow\\r\\nAlexander's band visible between the primary and secondary bows.\\r\\nrainbow formed in kerala","input":"What are the true colors of a rainbow?"},{"output":"bluegrass","context":"Bluegrass music is a form of American roots music, and a related genre of country music. Influenced by the music of Appalachia,[1] bluegrass has mixed roots in Irish, Scottish and English[2] traditional music, and was also later influenced by the music of African-Americans[3] through incorporation of jazz elements.\\r\\nSettlers from Britain and Ireland arrived in Appalachia during the 18th century, and brought with them the musical traditions of their homelands.[4] These traditions consisted primarily of English and Scottish balladswhich were essentially unaccompanied narrativeand dance music, such as Irish reels, which were accompanied by a fiddle.[5] Many older bluegrass songs come directly from the British Isles. Several Appalachian bluegrass ballads, such as \\"Pretty Saro\\", \\"Cuckoo Bird\\" and \\"House Carpenter\\", come from England and preserve the English ballad tradition both melodically and lyrically.[6] Others, such as The Two Sisters, also come from England; however, the lyrics are about Ireland.[7] Some bluegrass fiddle songs popular in Appalachia, such as \\"Leather Britches\\", and \\"Pretty Polly\\", have Scottish roots.[8] The dance tune Cumberland Gap may be derived from the tune that accompanies the Scottish ballad Bonnie George Campbell.[9] Other songs have different names in different places; for instance in England there is an old ballad known as \\"A Brisk Young Sailor Courted Me\\", but exactly the same song in North American bluegrass is known as \\"I Wish My Baby Was Born\\".[10]\\r\\nIn bluegrass, as in some forms of jazz, one or more instruments each takes its turn playing the melody and improvising around it, while the others perform accompaniment; this is especially typified in tunes called breakdowns.[11] This is in contrast to old-time music, in which all instruments play the melody together or one instrument carries the lead throughout while the others provide accompaniment.[11] Breakdowns are often characterized by rapid tempos and unusual instrumental dexterity and sometimes by complex chord changes.[12]\\r\\nThere are three major subgenres of bluegrass and one unofficial subgenre. Traditional bluegrass has musicians playing folk songs, tunes with traditional chord progressions, and using only acoustic instruments, with an example being Bill Monroe. Progressive bluegrass groups may use electric instruments and import songs from other genres, particularly rock & roll. Examples include Cadillac Sky and Bearfoot. Another subgenre, \\"Bluegrass gospel\\" uses Christian lyrics, soulful three- or four-part harmony singing, and sometimes the playing of instrumentals. A newer development in the bluegrass world is Neo-traditional bluegrass; exemplified by bands such as The Grascals and Mountain Heart, bands from this subgenre typically have more than one lead singer. Bluegrass music has attracted a diverse following worldwide. Bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe characterized the genre as: \\"Scottish bagpipes and ole-time fiddlin'. It's Methodist and Holiness and Baptist. It's blues and jazz, and it has a high lonesome sound.\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike mainstream country music, bluegrass is traditionally played on acoustic stringed instruments. The fiddle, five-string banjo, guitar, mandolin, and upright bass (string bass) are often joined by the resonator guitar (also referred to as a Dobro) and (occasionally) harmonica or Jew's harp. This instrumentation originated in rural dance bands and is the basis on which the earliest bluegrass bands were formed.[14]\\r\\nThe guitar is now most commonly played with a style referred to as flatpicking, unlike the style of early bluegrass guitarists such as Lester Flatt, who used a thumb pick and finger pick. Banjo players often use the three-finger picking style made popular by banjoists such as Don Reno and Earl Scruggs. Fiddlers frequently play in thirds and fifths, producing a sound that is characteristic to the bluegrass style. Bassists almost always play pizzicato, occasionally adopting the \\"slap-style\\" to accentuate the beat. A bluegrass bass line is generally a rhythmic alternation between the tonic and dominant of each chord, with occasional walking bass excursions.\\r\\nInstrumentation has been an ongoing topic of debate. Traditional bluegrass performers believe the \\"correct\\" instrumentation is that used by Bill Monroe's band, the Blue Grass Boys (mandolin, fiddle, guitar, banjo and bass). Departures from the traditional instrumentation have included dobro, accordion, harmonica, piano, autoharp, drums, electric guitar, and electric versions of other common bluegrass instruments, resulting in what has been referred to as \\"newgrass.\\"\\r\\nApart from specific instrumentation, a distinguishing characteristic of bluegrass is vocal harmony featuring two, three, or four parts, often with a dissonant or modal sound in the highest voice (see modal frame), a style described as the \\"high, lonesome sound.\\"[15] Commonly, the ordering and layering of vocal harmony is called the \\"stack\\". A standard stack has a baritone voice at the bottom, the lead in the middle (singing the main melody) and a tenor at the top; although stacks can be altered, especially where a female voice is included. Alison Krauss and Union Station provide a good example of a different harmony stack with a baritone and tenor with a high lead, an octave above the standard melody line, sung by the female vocalist. However, by employing variants to the standard trio vocal arrangement, they were simply following a pattern existing since the early days of the genre. The Stanley Brothers utilized a high baritone part on several of their trios recorded for Columbia records during their time with that label (1950ÿ1953). Mandolin player Pee Wee Lambert sang the high baritone above Ralph Stanley's tenor, both parts above Carter's lead vocal. This trio vocal arrangement was variously used by other groups as well. In the 1960s Flatt and Scruggs often added a fifth part to the traditional quartet parts on gospel songs, the extra part being a high baritone (doubling the baritone part sung in the normal range of that voice; E.P. Tullock [aka Cousin Jake] providing the part). The use of a high lead with the tenor and baritone below it was most famously employed by the Osborne Brothers who first employed it during their time with MGM records in the latter half of the 1950s. This vocal arrangement would be the home aspect of the Osbornes' sound with Bobby's high, clear voice at the top of the vocal stack.\\r\\nBluegrass tunes can largely be described as narratives on the everyday lives of the people whence the music came. Aside from laments about loves lost, interpersonal tensions and unwanted changes to the region (e.g., the visible effects of mountaintop coal mining), bluegrass vocals frequently reference the hard-scrabble existence of living in Appalachia and other rural areas with modest financial resources. Some protest music has been composed in the bluegrass style, especially concerning the vicissitudes of the Appalachian coal mining industry. Railroading has also been a popular theme, with ballads such as \\"Wreck of the Old 97\\" and \\"Nine Pound Hammer\\" (from the legend of John Henry) being exemplary.\\r\\nBluegrass, as a distinct musical form, developed from elements of old-time music and traditional music of the Appalachian region of the United States. The Appalachian region was where many English and Ulster-Scots immigrants settled, bringing with them the musical traditions of their homelands. Hence the sounds of jigs and reels, especially as played on the fiddle, were innate to the developing style. Black musicians infused characteristics of the blues to the mix, and in a development that was key to shaping the bluegrass sound, introduced the iconic banjo to the region.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe music now known as bluegrass was frequently used to accompany a rural dancing style known as buckdancing, flatfooting or clogging. As the bluegrass sound spread to urban areas, listening to it for its own sake increased, especially after the advent of audio recording. In 1948, what would come to be known as bluegrass emerged as a genre within the post-war country/western-music industry, a period of time characterized now as the golden era or wellspring of \\"traditional bluegrass.\\" From its earliest days, bluegrass has been recorded and performed by professional and amateur musicians alike. Although amateur bluegrass musicians and trends such as \\"parking-lot picking\\" are too important to be ignored, it is touring musicians who have set the direction of the style. Radio stations dedicated to bluegrass have also proved influential in advancing the evolution of the style into distinctive subgenres.\\r\\nBluegrass was initially included in the category of folk music and later changed to hillbilly. In 1948, bluegrass was placed under the country/western heading for radio airplay charting. All four of the seminal bluegrass authors - Artis, Price, Cantwell and Rosenberg - described bluegrass music in detail as originating in style and form, in one form or another, between the 1930s and mid-1940s. However, the term \\"bluegrass\\" did not appear formally to describe the music until the late 1950s, and did not appear in Music Index until 1965 (Kretzschmar, 1970). The first entry in Music Index mentioning \\"bluegrass music\\" directed the reader to \\"see Country Music; Hillbilly Music\\" (Kretzschmar, 1970, p.?91). Music Index maintained this listing for bluegrass music until 1986. The first time bluegrass music had its own entries in Music Index was 1987 (Stratelak, 1988).\\r\\nThe topical and narrative themes of many bluegrass songs are highly reminiscent of folk music. Many songs that are widely considered to be bluegrass are in reality older works legitimately classified as folk or old-time music that are performed in the bluegrass style. The interplay between bluegrass and folk forms has been academically studied. Folklorist Dr. Neil Rosenberg, for example, shows that most devoted bluegrass fans and musicians are familiar with traditional folk songs and old-time music and that these songs are often played at shows, festivals and jams (Rosenberg, 1985).\\r\\n\\"Bluegrass\\" is a common name given in America for grass of the Poa genus, the most famous being Kentucky bluegrass. A large region in central Kentucky is sometimes called the Bluegrass region (although this region is west of the hills of Kentucky).\\r\\nExactly when the word \\"bluegrass\\" itself was adopted to label this form of music is not certain, but is believed to be in the late 1950s.[16] It was derived from the name of the seminal Blue Grass Boys band, formed in 1939 with Bill Monroe as its leader. Due to this lineage, Bill Monroe is frequently referred to as the \\"father of bluegrass\\".[17]\\r\\nMonroe's 1946 to 1948 band, which featured banjo prodigy Earl Scruggs, singer-guitarist Lester Flatt, fiddler Chubby Wise and bassist Howard Watts (also known as \\"Cedric Rainwater\\")sometimes called \\"the original bluegrass band\\"created the definitive sound and instrumental configuration that remains a model to this day. By some arguments, while the Blue Grass Boys were the only band playing this music, it was just their unique sound; it could not be considered a musical style until other bands began performing in similar fashion. In 1948, the Stanley Brothers recorded the traditional song \\"Molly and Tenbrooks\\" in the Blue Grass Boys' style, arguably the point in time that bluegrass emerged as a distinct musical form.[18] As Ralph Stanley himself said about the origins of the genre and its name:\\r\\nOh, (Monroe) was the first. But it wasn't called bluegrass back then. It was just called old time mountain hillbilly music. When they started doing the bluegrass festivals in 1965, everybody got together and wanted to know what to call the show, y'know. It was decided that since Bill was the oldest man, and was from the bluegrass state of Kentucky and he had the Blue Grass Boys, it would be called 'bluegrass.'[19]\\r\\nFirst generation bluegrass musicians dominated the genre from its beginnings in the mid-1940s through the mid-1960s. This group generally consists of those who were playing during the \\"Golden Age\\" in the 1950s, including Bill Monroe and his Blue Grass Boys, the Stanley Brothers, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs with the Foggy Mountain Boys, Hylo Brown and The Timberliners, Reno and Smiley, Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, Jim and Jesse, Jimmy Martin and the Osborne Brothers, Red Allen (who also recorded with the Osborne Brothers for MGM in the mid-fifties), Mac Wiseman, Mac Martin and the Dixie Travelers, Carl Story and his Rambling Mountaineers, Buzz Busby, The Lilly Brothers, Bill Clifton and Jim Eanes, and the Country Gentlemen - one of the first bands to include material from outside the usual corpus of bluegrass music.\\r\\nA second generation of bluegrass musicians began performing, composing and recording in the mid-to late-1960s, although many had played in firstÿgeneration bands from a young age. Some bluegrass musicians in this group are Jimmy Martin, Doc Watson, J. D. Crowe, Doyle Lawson, Sam Bush, Bla Fleck, John Hartford, Jerry Douglas, Norman Blake, Frank Wakefield, Bill Keith, Del McCoury and Tony Rice. As they refined their craft, the New Grass Revival, Seldom Scene, The Kentucky Colonels, and The Dillards developed progressive bluegrass. In one collaboration, first-generation bluegrass fiddler Vassar Clements, progressive mandolin player David Grisman, Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia (on banjo), and Peter Rowan on lead vocals played in the band called Old and in the Way. Garcia, Chris Hillman, Dickey Betts of The Allman Brothers Band and others in the 1960s and 1970s helped introduce rock music listeners to progressive and traditional bluegrass. Bush, Grisman, and Clements developed strong jazz elements in most of their playingClements liked to refer to his music as \\"hillbilly jazz\\"but each owes much to traditional bluegrass.\\r\\nThird generation bluegrass developed in the mid-1980s. Bluegrass grew, matured and broadened from the music played in previous years. This generation redefined \\"mainstream bluegrass\\". High-quality sound equipment allowed each band member to be miked independently, exemplified by Tony Rice Unit and The Bluegrass Album Band. Tony Rice showcased elaborate lead guitar solos, and other bands followed. The electric bass became a general, but not universal, alternative to the traditional acoustic bass, though electrification of other instruments continued to meet resistance outside progressive circles. Nontraditional chord progressions also became more widely accepted. On the other hand, this generation saw a renaissance of more traditional songs, played in the newer style. The Johnson Mountain Boys were one of the decade's most popular touring groups, and played strictly traditional bluegrass.\\r\\nIn recent decades bluegrass music has reached a broader audience. Major mainstream country music performers have recorded bluegrass albums, including Dolly Parton and Patty Loveless, who each released several bluegrass albums. Since the late 1990s, Ricky Skaggs, who began as a bluegrass musician and crossed over to mainstream country in the 1980s, returned to bluegrass with his band Kentucky Thunder. The Coen Brothers' film O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000) has a country and bluegrass soundtrack which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2002. The documentary and concert film Down from the Mountain (2000) featured a live performance by the music artists who participated in the recording of the soundtrack recording.\\r\\nContemporary artists such as Chris Thile are continuing the spread of traditional bluegrass music. Famous for playing in the band Nickel Creek when he was young, Thile is now collaborating with varying diverse artists, and continues to play music in the genre. His latest band, Punch Brothers, has progressed contemporary bluegrass music through fusion with other forms and genres.\\r\\nMeanwhile, festivals such as the Telluride Bluegrass Festival and RockyGrass in Lyons, Colorado, and bands such as the Nederland, Colorado-based Yonder Mountain String Band and Druh Trva in the Czech Republic attract large audiences while expanding the range of progressive bluegrass in college jam-band atmospheres, often called \\"jamgrass.\\" Bluegrass fused with jazz is found in the music of Bla Fleck and The Flecktones, Railroad Earth, Tony Rice, Andy Statman, Sam Bush, Doc Watson, and others.\\r\\nThere are three major subgenres of bluegrass and one unofficial subgenre.[citation needed]\\r\\nTraditional bluegrass emphasizes the traditional elements; musicians play folk songs, tunes with simple traditional chord progressions, and use only acoustic instruments. Generally, compositions are performed on instruments that were played by Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys in the late 1940s. In the early years, instruments no longer accepted in mainstream bluegrass, such as the accordion, were used. Traditional bands may use their instruments in slightly different ways; for example playing the banjo by the claw-hammer style, or using multiple guitars or fiddles in a band. In this subgenre, the guitar rarely leads but acts as a rhythm instrument, one notable exception being gospel-based songs. Melodies and lyrics tend to be simple, often in G major, and a I-IV-V chord pattern is common. Although traditional bluegrass performers eschew electrically amplified instruments, as used in other forms of popular music, it is common practice to \\"mike\\" acoustic instruments during stage performances before larger audiences.\\r\\nTraditional bluegrass bands such as Ralph Stanley and the Clinch Mountain Boys, Del McCoury, Larry Sparks & The Lonesome Ramblers, Ricky Skaggs and Kentucky Thunder, Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver, and The Gibson Brothers, enjoy nationwide popularity. California mountain bluegrass, a variation on traditional, has enjoyed regional popularity with such bands as Rita Hosking and Cousin Jack.\\r\\nAnother major subgenre is progressive bluegrass.[20] Groups may use electric instruments and import songs from other genres, particularly rock & roll. Although a more recent phenomenon, progressive bluegrass has roots going back to one of the earliest bluegrass bands. The banjo and bass duets Earl Scruggs played even in the earliest days of the Foggy Mountain Boys hint at the wild chord progressions to come. The four key distinguishing elements (not always all present) of progressive bluegrass are instrumentation (frequently including electric instruments, drums, piano, and more), songs imported (or styles imitated) from other genres, chord progressions, and lengthy \\"jam band\\"-style improvisation.[21] New Grass Revival utilized these elements to great popularity in the 1970s and 1980s and the term \\"newgrass\\" became synonymous with \\"progressive bluegrass\\". The String Cheese Incident is one band that sometimes mixes a bluegrass tune with a jam band feeling, especially in original tunes like \\"Dudley's Kitchen\\". A twist on this genre is combining elements that preceded bluegrass, such as old-time string band music, with bluegrass music.\\r\\nArists and bands identified with this subgenre include Bla Fleck, Chris Thile, David Grisman, Jerry Douglas, Sam Bush, Casey Driessen, New Grass Revival, Psychograss, Crooked Still, Nickel Creek, Cadillac Sky, The Dixie Bee-Liners, Skyline, The Greencards, The Dillards, Elephant Revival, Punch Brothers, The Infamous Stringdusters, and Bearfoot.[citation needed]\\r\\nMany bluegrass artists incorporate gospel music into their repertoire. Distinctive elements of this style include Christian lyrics, soulful three- or four-part harmony singing, and sometimes playing instrumentals subdue.[citation needed] A cappella choruses are popular with bluegrass gospel artists, though the harmony structure differs somewhat from standard barbershop or choir singing.[citation needed] Mainstream bluegrass artists Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver[22] and IIIrd Tyme Out have produced bluegrass gospel music, while Mount Zion play bluegrass gospel exclusively.\\r\\nA newer development in the bluegrass world is Neo-traditional bluegrass. In the 1990s, most bluegrass bands were headed by a solo artist such as Doyle Lawson and Rhonda Vincent, with an accompanying band.[citation needed] Bands playing this subgenre include The Grascals, Mountain Heart, Steep Canyon Rangers, The Dixie Bee-Liners, The SteelDrivers, Pert Near Sandstone, Balsam Range, and Cherryholmes, who allwith the exception of Waterfall Blue Boyshave more than one lead singer.","input":"What is the most established and iconic instrumental ensemble in western culture?"},{"output":"Andes","context":"The world's longest above-water mountain range is the Andes,[1][2] about 7,000?km (4,300?mi) long.

The Edwin Smith Papyrus was written around 1600 BC (possibly a fragmentary copy of a text from 2500 BC) and contains a description of cancer, as well as a procedure to remove breast tumours by cauterization. [1]\\r\\nHippocrates (ca. 460 BC ÿ ca. 370 BC) described several kinds of cancer, referring to them by the term karkinos (carcinos), the Greek word for crab or crayfish, as well as carcinoma.[2] This comes from the appearance of the cut surface of a solid malignant tumour, with \\"the veins stretched on all sides as the animal the crab has its feet, whence it derives its name\\".[3] Since it was against Greek tradition to open the body, Hippocrates only described and made drawings of outwardly visible tumors on the skin, nose, and breasts. Treatment was based on the humor theory of four bodily fluids (black and yellow bile, blood, and phlegm). According to the patient's humor, treatment consisted of diet, blood-letting, and/or laxatives. Celsus (ca. 25 BC - 50 AD) translated karkinos into cancer, the Latin word for crab or crayfish.\\r\\nIn the 2nd century AD, the Greek physician Galen used oncos (Greek for swelling) to describe all tumours, reserving Hippocrates' term carcinos for malignant tumours. Galen also used the suffix -oma to indicate cancerous lesions. It is from Galen's usage that we derive the modern word oncology.[4]\\r\\nThrough the centuries it was discovered that cancer could occur anywhere in the body, but Hippocrates' humor-theory based treatment remained popular until the 19th century with the discovery of cells.\\r\\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, it became more acceptable for doctors to dissect bodies to discover the cause of death. The German professor Wilhelm Fabry believed that breast cancer was caused by a milk clot in a mammary duct. The Dutch professor Francois de la Boe Sylvius, a follower of Descartes, believed that all disease was the outcome of chemical processes, and that acidic lymph fluid was the cause of cancer. His contemporary Nicolaes Tulp believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads, and concluded that it was contagious.[5]\\r\\nThe first cause of cancer was identified by British surgeon Percivall Pott, who discovered in 1775 that cancer of the scrotum was a common disease among chimney sweeps. The work of other individual physicians led to various insights, but when physicians started working together they could draw firmer conclusions.\\r\\nWith the widespread use of the microscope in the 18th century, it was discovered that the 'cancer poison' eventually spreads from the primary tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites (\\"metastasis\\"). This view of the disease was first formulated by the English surgeon Campbell De Morgan between 1871 and 1874.[6] The use of surgery to treat cancer had poor results due to problems with hygiene. The renowned Scottish surgeon Alexander Monro saw only 2 breast tumor patients out of 60 surviving surgery for two years. In the 19th century, asepsis improved surgical hygiene and as the survival statistics went up, surgical removal of the tumor became the primary treatment for cancer. With the exception of William Coley who in the late 19th century felt that the rate of cure after surgery had been higher before asepsis (and who injected bacteria into tumors with mixed results), cancer treatment became dependent on the individual art of the surgeon at removing a tumor. The underlying cause of his results might be that infection stimulates the immune system to destroy left tumor cells. During the same period, the idea that the body was made up of various tissues, that in turn were made up of millions of cells, laid rest the humor-theories about chemical imbalances in the body.\\r\\nThe genetic basis of cancer was recognised in 1902 by the German zoologist Theodor Boveri, professor of zoology at Munich and later in Wrzburg.[7] He discovered a method to generate cells with multiple copies of the centrosome, a structure he discovered and named. He postulated that chromosomes were distinct and transmitted different inheritance factors. He suggested that mutations of the chromosomes could generate a cell with unlimited growth potential which could be passed on to its descendants. He proposed the existence of cell cycle check points, tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes. He speculated that cancers might be caused or promoted by radiation, physical or chemical insults or by pathogenic microorganisms.\\r\\nWhen Marie Curie and Pierre Curie discovered radiation at the end of the 19th century, they stumbled upon the first effective non-surgical cancer treatment. With radiation also came the first signs of multi-disciplinary approaches to cancer treatment. The surgeon was no longer operating in isolation, but worked together with hospital radiologists to help patients. The complications in communication this brought, along with the necessity of the patient's treatment in a hospital facility rather than at home, also created a parallel process of compiling patient data into hospital files, which in turn led to the first statistical patient studies.\\r\\nThe American Cancer Society was founded in 1913 by 15 physicians and businessmen in New York City under the name American Society for the Control of Cancer (ASCC). The current name was adopted in 1945.[8]\\r\\nA founding paper of cancer epidemiology was the work of Janet Lane-Claypon, who published a comparative study in 1926 of 500 breast cancer cases and 500 control patients of the same background and lifestyle for the British Ministry of Health. Her ground-breaking work on cancer epidemiology was carried on by Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill, who published \\"Lung Cancer and Other Causes of Death In Relation to Smoking. A Second Report on the Mortality of British Doctors\\" followed in 1956 (otherwise known as the British doctors study). Richard Doll left the London Medical Research Center (MRC), to start the Oxford unit for Cancer epidemiology in 1968. With the use of computers, the unit was the first to compile large amounts of cancer data. Modern epidemiological methods are closely linked to current[when?] concepts of disease and public health policy. Over the past 50?years, great efforts have been spent on gathering data across medical practice, hospital, provincial, state, and even country boundaries to study the interdependence of environmental and cultural factors on cancer incidence.\\r\\nCancer patient treatment and studies were restricted to individual physicians' practices until World War II, when medical research centers discovered that there were large international differences in disease incidence. This insight drove national public health bodies to enable the compilation of health data across practices and hospitals, a process found in many countries today. The Japanese medical community observed that the bone marrow of victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was completely destroyed. They concluded that diseased bone marrow could also be destroyed with radiation, and this led to the development of bone marrow transplants for leukemia. Since World War II, trends in cancer treatment are to improve on a micro-level the existing treatment methods, standardize them, and globalize them to find cures through epidemiology and international partnerships.\\r\\nIn 1968 Anthony Epstein, Bert Achong and Yvonne Barr identified the first human cancer virus, called the Epstein-Barr Virus.[9]\\r\\nThe political 'war' on cancer began with the National Cancer Act of 1971, a United States federal law.[10] The act was intended \\"to amend the Public Health Service Act so as to strengthen the National Cancer Institute in order to more effectively carry out the national effort against cancer\\". It was signed into law by then U.S. President Richard Nixon on December 23, 1971.[11]\\r\\nIn 1973, cancer research led to a cold war incident,[12] where co-operative samples of reported oncoviruses were discovered to be contaminated by HeLa.\\r\\nIn 1984, Harald zur Hausen discovered first HPV16 and then HPV18 responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers. For discovery that human papillomaviruses (HPV) cause human cancer, zur Hausen won a 2008 Nobel Prize.[13]\\r\\nSince 1971 the United States has invested over $200 billion on cancer research; that total includes money invested by public and private sectors and foundations.[14]\\r\\nDespite this substantial investment, the country has seen just a five percent decrease in the cancer death rate (adjusting for size and age of the population) between 1950 and 2005.[15] Longer life expectancy may be a contributing factor to this, as cancer rates and mortality rates increases significantly with age, more than three out of five cancers are diagnosed in people aged 65 and over.[16]","input":"When was the first case of cancer recorded?"},{"output":"3ÿ4 defensive alignment","context":"In American football, the 3ÿ4 defense is a common defensive alignment consisting of three down linemen and four linebackers. It is a called a \\"base defense\\" because it is the default defensive alignment used on \\"base downs\\" (1st and 2nd downs). However, defenses will readily switch to other defensive alignments (such as a dime) as circumstances change. Alternately some defenses use a 4-3.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 3ÿ4 defense incorporates three defensive linemen ÿ two defensive ends and one nose tackle, who line up opposite the other team's offensive line. Those three players are responsible for engaging the other team's offensive line, allowing the four linebackers to either rush the quarterback or drop back into coverage, depending on the situation. While the role of the defensive linemen is fairly consistent, the linebackers allow for the flexibility and versatility of the 3-4 scheme, and give defensive coaches nearly limitless options to confuse the other team's players and coaches. Depending on the situation, any number of linebackers can blitz, fake a blitz, \\"spy\\" the quarterback or running back, or cover receivers. In key situations, a rush linebacker may be sent to cover the flat on the opposite side of the blitzing defensive back; this is called a \\"zone blitz\\".\\r\\nAfter becoming the predominant defensive alignment in the late 1970s-early 1980s,[1] the 3ÿ4 defense declined in popularity over the next two decades, but experienced a resurgence in the 2000s among both professional and college football teams. As of 2017, NFL teams that regularly incorporate the 3ÿ4 defensive alignment scheme as a base include the Green Bay Packers, Oakland Raiders, Los Angeles Rams, Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Ravens, Arizona Cardinals, Indianapolis Colts, Kansas City Chiefs, New York Jets, Washington Redskins, Denver Broncos, Tennessee Titans, Houston Texans, and the Chicago Bears, who used the 3-4 as their base defense for the first time in 2015.\\r\\nThe Philadelphia Eagles ran the 3-4 from 2013 to 2015 but switched back to the 4-3 for the 2016 season. The New England Patriots returned to a 4ÿ3 defensive front at the end of the 2011 season. The Cleveland Browns used the 3-4 in 2016, but are returning to the 4-3 in 2017 under new defensive coordinator Gregg Williams.\\r\\nNew Rams head coach Sean McVay hired Wade Phillips as defensive coordinator prior to 2017. Phillips switched the Rams to the 3-4, the first time the team has used it since the early 1990s prior to the franchise's move to St. Louis.\\r\\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers have used the 3ÿ4 as their base defense since 1982, the season after Hall of Fame defensive tackle Joe Greene and end L. C. Greenwood retired. In fact, the Steelers were the only NFL team to use the 3ÿ4 defense during the 2001 NFL season, but finished the season as the number one defense in the NFL.[2] It is believed that the Steelers success with the 3ÿ4 defense is the primary reason why many NFL teams have started returning to the formation.[3]\\r\\nThe 3ÿ4 defense was originally devised by Bud Wilkinson at the University of Oklahoma in the 1940s. Chuck Fairbanks, who coached the Sooners from 1967ÿ72, learned the defense from Wilkinson and is credited with importing it to the NFL when he became coach of the New England Patriots in 1973.[4] The 1972 Miami Dolphins were the first team to win a Super Bowl with the 3ÿ4 defense, going undefeated and using number 53, Bob Matheson, as a down lineman or rushing linebacker. When the Oakland Raiders defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl XV, it marked the first Super Bowl in which both teams used the 3ÿ4 as their base defense. Also notable, the Big Blue Wrecking Crew, the defensive unit for the 1986 New York Giants who won Super Bowl XXI, was a 3ÿ4 defense and featured all-time great Lawrence Taylor as outside linebacker. By the mid-1990s, only a few teams used a 3ÿ4 defense, most notably the Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers.[5]\\r\\nThe defensive line is made up of a nose tackle (NT) and two defensive ends (DEs). Linemen in 3ÿ4 schemes tend to be larger than their 4ÿ3 counterparts to take up more space and guard more territory along the defensive front. As a consequence, many 3ÿ4 defensive linemen begin their NFL careers as 4-3 defensive tackles, as younger players typically do not possess the size, weight, and strength to play on a 3-4 defensive front. They must be strong at the point of attack and are aligned in most cases head-up on an offensive tackle. First and foremost, they must control run gaps. Size and strength become more of a factor for linemen in 3ÿ4 defenses than in 4ÿ3 defenses because they move primarily within the confines of line play and seldom are in space using athletic ability. Ideally 3ÿ4 DEs should weigh 290ÿ315 pounds (132ÿ143?kg) and be able to beat double teams by getting a push.[7] Albert Breer noted, \\"In general, ideal front-seven players in the 3ÿ4 are bigger and need to take on and defeat blocks more often in the running game.\\"[8]\\r\\nThe 3ÿ4 nose tackle is considered the most physically demanding position in football.[9] His primary responsibility is to control the \\"A\\" gaps, the two openings between the center and guards, and not get pushed back into his linebackers.[10] If a running play comes through one of those gaps, he must make the tackle or control what is called the \\"jump-through\\"the guard or center who is trying to get out to the linebackers. The ideal nose tackle has to be much bigger than 4ÿ3 DTs, weighing around 335 pounds or more. An AFC Personnel director used Ted Washington as an example of an ideal nose tackle: \\"In his prime, Ted Washington was the ideal guy. He was huge, had long arms, and you couldn't budge him. He could hold off a 320-pound lineman with one hand and make the tackle with the other.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe base position of NT is across from the opposing team's center. This location is usually referred to as zero technique. The two DEs flank the NT and line up off the offensive guards. The location off the offensive guard is usually referred to as three technique.\\r\\nIn a 3ÿ4 defense, four linebackers (LBs) are positioned behind the defensive line. The linebacker unit is made up of two inside linebackers (ILBs) flanked by two outside linebackers (OLBs). The OLBs often line up closer to the line of scrimmage than the ILBs, but may also be positioned at the same depth or deeper in coverage than the ILBs (though this is somewhat rare).\\r\\nThere are two types of ILB's, the Mike (for strong side) and the Will (for weak side). The Will typically is the more athletic linebacker, who can blitz, drop into coverage, play the run, and \\"spy\\" the quarterback.[12] The Mike is typically the stronger and larger of the two linebackers, and is used almost like a Fullback on the defense. He takes on and occupies blockers for the Will, allowing the Will to flow to the ball and make tackles.[13]\\r\\nThe 3ÿ4 also has two types of OLBs. The Joker, Jack, Buck, or Elephant is usually the primary pass rusher. Depending on the scheme, the Joker can be on either side of the defensive formation. He must be an excellent pass rusher, and has to be able to beat both stronger right tackles and rangier left tackles off the edge of the formation.[14] The other 3ÿ4 OLB, The Sam, does not have a specific designation. Like a Sam linebacker in a 4ÿ3 scheme, the other 3ÿ4 OLB must be able to cover, blitz, and play the run.\\r\\nStrengths of the 3ÿ4 include speedy ILBs and OLBs in pursuit of backs in run defense and flexibility to use multiple rushers to confuse the quarterback during passing plays without being forced into man-to-man defense on receivers. Most teams try to disrupt the offense's passing attack by rushing four defenders. In a standard 4ÿ3 alignment, these four rushers are usually the four down linemen. But in a 3ÿ4, the fourth rusher is usually a linebacker, though many teams use a safety to blitz and confuse the coverage, giving them more defensive options in the same 3ÿ4 look. However, since there are four linebackers and four defensive backs, the fourth potential rusher can come from any of eight defensive positions. This is designed to confuse the quarterback's pre-snap defensive read.\\r\\nA drawback of the 3ÿ4 is that without a fourth lineman to take on the offensive blockers and close the running lanes, both the defensive linemen and the linebackers can be overwhelmed by blocking schemes in the running game. To be effective, 3ÿ4 linebackers need their defensive line to routinely tie up a minimum of four (preferably all five) offensive linemen, freeing them to make tackles. The 3ÿ4 linebackers must be very athletic and strong enough to shed blocks by fullbacks, tight ends, and offensive linemen to get to the running back. In most cases, 3ÿ4 OLBs lead their teams in quarterback sacks.[15]\\r\\nUsually, teams that run a 3ÿ4 defense look for college \\"tweeners\\"defensive ends that are too small to play the position in the pros and not quite fluid enough to play outside linebacker in a 4ÿ3 defenseas their 3ÿ4 outside linebacker. The wisdom of this strategy is demonstrated in the career of Harry Carson, who played as a defensive lineman in his college career and then went on to become a Hall of Fame ILB for the New York Giants in the 70s and 80s. According to NFL coach Wade Phillips, 3ÿ4 linebackers \\"are a little bit cheaper, and you can find more of them,\\" while \\"it's harder to find defensive linemen to play a 4ÿ3 and pay for all of them.\\"[16]\\r\\nThe 3ÿ4 defense generally uses four defensive backs. Two of these are safeties, and two of them are cornerbacks. A cornerback's responsibilities vary depending on the type of coverage called. Coverage is simply how the defense will be protecting against the pass. The corners will generally line up 3 to 5 yards off the line of scrimmage, generally trying to \\"Jam\\" or interrupt the receivers route within the first 5 yards. A corner will be given one of two ways to defend the pass (with variations that result in more or less the same responsibilities): zone and man-to-man. In zone coverage, the cornerback is responsible for an area on the field. In this case, the corner must always stay downfield of whomever it is covering while still remaining in its zone. Zone is a more relaxed defensive scheme meant to provide more awareness across the defensive secondary while sacrificing tight coverage. As such, the corner in this case would be responsible for making sure nobody gets outside of him, always, or downfield of him, in cases where there is no deep safety help. In man coverage, however, the cornerback is solely responsible for the man across from him, usually the offensive player split farthest out.\\r\\nThe free safety is responsible for reading the offensive plays and covering deep passes. Depending on the defensive call, he may also provide run support. He is positioned 10 to 15 yards behind the line of scrimmage, toward the center of the field. He provides the last line of defense against running backs and receivers who get past the linebackers and cornerbacks. He must be a quick and smart player, capable of making tackles efficiently as well as reading the play and alerting his team of game situations.\\r\\nThe strong safety is usually larger than the free safety and is positioned relatively close to the line of scrimmage. He is often an integral part of the run defense, but is also responsible for defending against a pass; especially against passes to the tight-ends.\\r\\nThe 3ÿ4 has two basic defensive variations: the one-gap and the two-gap. In a two-gap system, the linemen are charged with tying up two blockers. This allows the linebackers to \\"flow downhill\\" and make tackles without shedding blocks.[17] The one gap, on the other hand, distributes the responsibility for gap coverage evenly between the linemen and linebackers. Each player has a few \\"key reads\\" after the ball is snapped. For example, the middle linebacker may be covering the strong side A gap (gap between center and strong side guard). If he sees the guard move right, then he flows with the guard, moving more or less laterally parallel to the line of scrimmage. If the guard moves left, he attacks downhill (perpendicular to the line of scrimmage) and \\"shoots his gap.\\" Responsibilities in the one gap vary depending on the defense.[18]\\r\\nVery few teams use purely one or two gap systems in today's NFL. However, the majority of teams, such as the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers primarily use the two-gap 3ÿ4. The Houston Texans and Denver Broncos primarily use the one gap 3ÿ4. The New York Jets use a versatile, hybrid defense combining one and two gap looks.[19]","input":"What type of defense do the broncos run?"},{"output":"the ghost pepper","context":"The Bhut jolokia (IPA: [?b??t.z??l?ki?ja]), also known as ghost pepper, ghost chili, U-morok, red naga, naga jolokia, and ghost jolokia, is an interspecific hybrid chili pepper cultivated in the Northeast Indian states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Nagaland and Manipur.[1][2] It is a hybrid of Capsicum chinense and Capsicum frutescens and is closely related to the Naga Morich of Bangladesh.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, Guinness World Records certified that the ghost pepper was the world's hottest chili pepper, 400 times hotter than Tabasco sauce. The ghost chili is rated at more than 1 million Scoville heat units (SHUs). However, the ghost chili was shortly superseded by the Infinity chili in 2011, followed by the Naga Viper, the Trinidad moruga scorpion in 2012 and the Carolina Reaper on August 7, 2013.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chili is named differently in different regions. In Assam, it is widely known as bh?t z?l?kia  (??? ???????) or bih z?l?kiya.  In some parts of Assam, this chili is called n?ga z?l?kia (??? ???????), believed to be named after the ferocious Naga warriors inhabiting the plains and hills of Nagaland.[5] Further complicating matters, a 2009 paper coined the English term \\"Naga king chili\\" which refers to the chili's large pod size.[6][7] This is probably because the chili has long been colloquially known as Raja mircha or Raja mirchi in Nagaland. It also stated that the most common Indian (Assamese) usage is bh?t z?l?kiya (??? ???????) and gives the alternate common name as bih z?l?kia (??? ???????, bih means \\"poison\\" in Assamese, denoting the plant's heat). The Assamese word z?l?kia simply means the Capsicum pepper. Other usages on the subcontinent are saga jlokia, Indian mystery chili, and Indian rough chili (after the chili's rough skin).[6][8] It has also been called the Tezpur chili after the Assamese city of Tezpur.[5] In Manipur, the chili is called umorok or oo-morok (oo = \\"tree\\", morok = \\"chili\\"). The Kukis called it \\"Malcha-Phoh\\" meaning \\"the most pungent chilli\\".[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, India's Defence Research Laboratory (DRL) reported a Scoville rating of 855,000 SHUs,[10] and in 2004 a rating of 1,041,427 SHUs was made using HPLC analysis.[11] For comparison, Tabasco red pepper sauce rates at 5000ÿ10,000, and pure capsaicin (the chemical responsible for the pungency of pepper plants) rates at 16,000,000 SHUs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, New Mexico State University's Chile Pepper Institute in Las Cruces, New Mexico,[12] found Bhut jolokia grown from seed in southern New Mexico to have a Scoville rating of 1,001,304 SHUs by HPLC.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nClimate has a considerable effect on the heat of these peppers. A 2005 study showed that Bhut jolokia peppers grown in Tezpur (Assam) are more than twice as hot as those grown in Gwalior's more arid climate.[13] Elsewhere in India, scientists at Manipur University measured its average Scoville rating by HPLC at only 329,100 SHUs.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike most peppers, Bhut jolokia produces capsaicin in vesicles found in both the placenta around the seeds and throughout the fruit, rather than just the placenta.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nRipe peppers measure 60 to 85?mm (2.4 to 3.3?in) long and 25 to 30?mm (1.0 to 1.2?in) wide with a red, yellow, orange, or chocolate color. The unselected strain of Bhut jolokia from India is an extremely variable plant, with a wide range in fruit sizes and fruit production per plant, and offers a huge potential for developing much better strains through selection in the future. Bhut jolokia pods are unique among peppers, with their characteristic shape, and very thin skin.[15] However, the red fruit variety has two different fruit types, the rough, dented fruit and the smooth fruit.

The rough fruit plants are taller, with more fragile branches, and the smooth fruit plants yields more fruit, and is a more compact plant with sturdier branches.[16] It takes about 7ÿ12 days to germinate at 32ÿ38?C.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBhut jolokia is used as a food and a spice, as well as a remedy to summer heat.[2] It is used in both fresh and dried forms, to \\"heat up\\" curries, pickles and chutneys. It is popularly used in combination with pork or dried or fermented fish. In northeastern India, the peppers are smeared on fences or incorporated in smoke bombs as a safety precaution to keep wild elephants at a distance.[17][18] The pepper's intense heat makes it a fixture in competitive chili pepper eating.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, scientists at India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) announced plans to use the peppers in hand grenades, as a nonlethal way to flush out terrorists from their hideouts and to control rioters.  It would also be developed into pepper spray as a self-defence and antirape product.[20][21] The DRDO said bhut jolokia-based aerosol sprays could be used as a \\"safety device\\", and \\"civil variants\\" of chili grenades could be used to control and disperse mobs.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nChili grenades made from Bhut jolokia were successfully used by the Indian Army in August 2015 to flush out terrorist Sajjad Ahmed, who was hiding in a cave.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2016, home minister of India, Rajnath Singh announced that Indian security forces will replace controversial pellet guns with pepper grenades.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dorset Naga is a substrain of the original Naga, selected from the Bangladeshi varieties of the chili, Naga morich.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnually, since 2005, the heat level of Dorset Naga has been tested, taking samples from different sites, various seasons, and states of maturity.

Constructed in the late 19th century, the facility advertises itself as having the world's largest porch. The Grand Hotel is well known for a number of notable visitors, including five U.S. presidents, Russian presidents Vladimir Putin and Dmitri Medvedev, inventor Thomas Edison, and author Mark Twain.\\r\\nGrand Hotel is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1886, the Michigan Central Railroad, Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, and Detroit and Cleveland Steamship Navigation Company formed the Mackinac Island Hotel Company. The group purchased the land on which the hotel was built and construction began, based upon the design by Detroit architects Mason and Rice. When it opened the following year, the hotel was advertised to Chicago, Erie, Montreal and Detroit residents as a summer retreat for vacationers who arrived by lake steamer and by rail from across the continent. The hotel opened on July 10, 1887 and took a mere 93 days to complete. At its opening, nightly rates at the hotel ranged from $3 to $5 a night (equivalent to $79.97ÿ133.28 in 2016[8]).[9]\\r\\nIn 1957, the Grand Hotel was designated a State Historic Building. In 1972, the hotel was named to the National Register of Historic Places, and on June 29, 1989, the hotel was made a National Historic Landmark.[10]\\r\\nCarleton Varney, a protg of Dorothy Draper, designed the Grand Hotel in its late 19th-century decor, including Pelargonium geraniums. Varney purposely designed the hotel so that all the rooms are different from each other in at least one aspect. There are four types of rooms: Category I, Category II, Category III, and Named Rooms. There are six two-bedroom suites consisting of two bedrooms connected by a parlor, of which two, the Grand Suite and the Carleton Varney Suite, overlook the Mackinac Bridge and the Straits of Mackinac. The presidential suite is located in the center of the hotel with a balcony over the porch. A detached structure added in early 2000 was named the Masco Cottage.[11]\\r\\nAdditionally, seven suites are named for and designed by seven former First Ladies of the United States. These are the Jacqueline Kennedy Suite (with carpet that includes the gold presidential eagle on a navy blue background and walls painted gold), Lady Bird Johnson Suite (yellow damask-covered walls with blue and gold wildflowers), Betty Ford Suite (green with cream and a dash of red), Rosalynn Carter Suite (with a sample of china designed for the Carter White House and wall coverings in Georgia peach), Nancy Reagan Suite (with signature red walls and Mrs. Reagan's personal touches), Barbara Bush Suite (designed with pale blue and pearl and with both Maine and Texas influences), and the Laura Bush Suite (decorated with bright cream and floral patterns inspired by the Texas prairie).[12]\\r\\nGrand Hotel's front porch is the longest in the world at some 660 feet (200?m) in length, overlooking a vast Tea Garden and the resort-scale Esther Williams swimming pool.[13] These areas are often used by guests on a casual family vacation, for large conventions, or concerts during the hotel's annual Labor Day Jazz Festival. The hotel has drawn some criticism for its policy of charging a $10 fee for non-guests to enter the building and enjoy the view from the famous porch.[14]\\r\\nBefore 2007, air conditioning was only available in public rooms, such as the lobby, parlor and Salle a Manger (main dining room). Due to the building's design it was difficult to add air conditioning to the guest rooms.[12] Air conditioning was installed in 170 guest rooms after water heat exchangers in the bathrooms were added. The exchangers cool the air through contact with the cold water system.[15]\\r\\nMackinac Island does not permit motor vehicles (except for emergency vehicles and, in winter, snowmobiles), and transport to and from the dock to the hotel is via horse-drawn carriage. The only other motor vehicles allowed in recent history were cars brought over for the filming of Somewhere in Time. During the winter months, when ice prevents ferry transport from the mainland, the hotel is closed. The island also has a small airport (no fuel or services) for private aircraft. The horse-drawn taxis will take guests from the airport to the hotel or any other destination.[16]\\r\\nU.S. Presidents Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy, Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton have visited the hotel. The hotel also hosted the first public demonstration of Thomas Edison's phonograph on the porch, as well as regular demonstrations of Edison's other new inventions. Mark Twain also made this a regular location on his speaking tours in the Midwest.[17]\\r\\nIn May each year, the Grand Hotel serves as the headquarters for the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce's Mackinac Policy Conference that attracts politicians, businessmen and labor leaders from across the state and the northern Midwest region.[18]\\r\\nConde Nast Traveler \\"Gold Lists\\" the hotel as one of the \\"Best Places to Stay in the Whole World\\" and Travel + Leisure magazine's lists it as among the \\"Top 100 Hotels in the World.\\" The Wine Spectator noted the Grand Hotel with an \\"Award of Excellence\\" and it was included in Gourmet magazine's \\"Top 25 Hotels in the World\\" list. The American Automobile Association (AAA) rates the facilities as a four-diamond resort.[19] and in 2009 named the Grand Hotel one of the top 10 U.S. historic hotels.[20]\\r\\nThe Grand Hotel served as a backdrop and one of the settings for the 1980 film Somewhere in Time starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour. Every October the hotel hosts an annual convention for fans of the cult classic.\\r\\nThe hotel also served as the setting for the 1947 musical comedy This Time for Keeps starring Jimmy Durante and Esther Williams (after whom the hotel's swimming pool is named).[17][21]\\r\\nThe hotel was the origin of the first World Sauntering Day in the 1970s.","input":"Who built the grand hotel on mackinac island?"},{"output":"Hirdesh Singh","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHirdesh Singh (born 15 March 1983), better known by his stage name Yo Yo Honey Singh or Honey Singh,[1] is an Indian music producer, Indi-pop singer and film actor.

Producers of the movie had to submit a petition in Delhi High Court claiming that they had 'muted' an alleged vulgar word in Singh's song. The court  heard a petition filed by lawyer Sanjay Bhatnagar seeking a stay on the film, contending that without the censor board's approval, the song could not be released with such a vulgar word. The petitioner had sought a stay on the release of the film until either the word or the song was deleted from the film.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis work has been perceived[by whom?] as being vulgar, misogynist, promoting violence against women and a bad influence on youth.[31][32] There have been reactions in print to Singh, such as from Annie Zaidi, who wrote  \\"An Open Letter to Honey Singh\\" in January 2013,[33] and Sandipan Sharma, who wrote \\"Thanks for the crassness: An open letter to Honey Singh from a parent\\" in July 2014.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2014, he and singer Raftaar were in dispute over whether Raftaar should receive credit for the lyrics of the song \\"Yeh Fugly Fugly Kya Hai\\".[35] The controversy went away without making a major effect.

Variants include the retired Falcon 9 v1.0 and Falcon 9 v1.1, as well as the current Falcon 9 Full Thrust, both partially-reusable launch systems powered by rocket engines utilizing liquid oxygen (LOX) and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) propellants.\\r\\nThe current \\"Full Thrust\\" version can lift payloads of up to 22,800 kilograms (50,300?lb) to low Earth orbit, and up to 8,300?kg (18,300?lb) to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), when configured in expendable mode.[1] The first stage can be recovered and reused for GTO payloads up to 5,500?kg (12,100?lb), automatically landing after disconnection of the second stage.[13][1][14][15]\\r\\nIn 2008, SpaceX won a Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program to deliver cargo to the International Space Station (ISS) using the Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule. The first mission under this contract launched in October 2012.\\r\\nAltogether, the initial version 1.0 flew five times from June 2010 to March 2013 and version 1.1 flew fifteen times from September 2013 to January 2016. The \\"Full Thrust\\" version has been in service since December 2015. The Falcon Heavy derivative, slated for debut in January 2018, groups three Falcon 9 first stages together. SpaceX intends to certify the Falcon 9 to be human-rated for transporting NASA astronauts to the ISS as part of the Commercial Crew Development program. In October 2016, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk announced an upcoming \\"final upgrade\\" called Falcon 9 Block 5, which will feature increased engine thrust, improved landing legs, and other minor improvements to help recovery and reuse.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile SpaceX spent its own money to develop its previous launcher, the Falcon 1, development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated by NASA funding parts of development costs and committing to purchase several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. This started with seed money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006.[16][17] The contract was structured as a Space Act Agreement (SAA) \\"to develop and demonstrate commercial orbital transportation service\\"[17] including the purchase of three demonstration flights.[18] The overall contract award was US$278 million to provide development funding for Dragon, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon. In 2011 additional milestones were added, bringing the total contract value to US$396 million.[19]\\r\\nNASA became an anchor tenant for the vehicle in 2008,[20][21] when they contracted to purchase 12 Commercial Resupply Services launches to the International Space Station, whereby funds would be disbursed only after the initial COTS demonstration missions were completed and deemed successful. The space logistics delivery contract was worth US$1.6 billion for a minimum of 12 missions to carry supplies to and from the station.[22]\\r\\nMusk has repeatedly said that, without the NASA money, development would have taken longer.\\r\\nSpaceX has only come this far by building upon the incredible achievements of NASA, having NASA as an anchor tenant for launch, and receiving expert advice and mentorship throughout the development process. SpaceX would like to extend a special thanks to the NASA COTS office for their continued support and guidance throughout this process. The COTS program has demonstrated the power of a true private/public partnership and we look forward to the exciting endeavors our team will accomplish in the future.[20]\\r\\nIn 2011, SpaceX estimated that Falcon 9 v1.0 development costs were on the order of $300 million.[23] NASA evaluated that development costs would have been $3.6 billion if a traditional cost-plus contract approach had been used.[24] In 2014, SpaceX released total combined development costs for both the Falcon 9 and the Dragon capsule. NASA provided US$396 million while SpaceX provided over US$450 million to fund rocket and capsule development efforts.[25]\\r\\nA 2011 NASA report \\"estimated that it would have cost the agency about US$4 billion to develop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster based upon NASA's traditional contracting processes\\" while \\"a more 'commercial development' approach might have allowed the agency to pay only US$1.7 billion.\\"[26]\\r\\nCongressional testimony by SpaceX in 2017 suggested that the unusual NASA process of \\"setting only a high-level requirement for cargo transport to the space station [while] leaving the details to industry\\" had allowed SpaceX to design and develop the Falcon 9 rocket on its own at substantially lower cost. \\"According to NASA's own independently verified numbers, SpaceXs development costs of both the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets were estimated at approximately US$390 million in total.\\"[26]\\r\\nSpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity vehicle, the Falcon 5.[27] In 2005, SpaceX announced it was instead proceeding with development of the Falcon 9, a \\"fully reusable heavy lift launch vehicle\\", and had already secured a government customer. The Falcon?9 was described as being capable of launching approximately 9,500?kg (21,000?lb) to low Earth orbit, and was projected to be priced at $27?million per flight with a 3.7?m (12?ft) fairing and $35 million with a 5.2?m (17?ft) fairing. SpaceX also announced development of a heavy version of the Falcon 9 with a payload capacity of approximately 25,000?kg (55,000?lb).[28] The Falcon 9 was intended to enable launches to LEO, GTO, as well as both crew and cargo vehicles to the ISS.[27]\\r\\nThe original NASA COTS contract called for the first demonstration flight of Falcon in September 2008, and completion of all three demonstration missions by September 2009.[29] In February 2008, the plan for the first Falcon 9/Dragon COTS Demo flight was delayed by six months to late in the first quarter of 2009. According to Elon Musk, the complexity of the development work and the regulatory requirements for launching from Cape Canaveral contributed to the delay.[30]\\r\\nThe first multi-engine test (with two engines connected to the first stage, firing simultaneously) was successfully completed in January 2008,[31] with successive tests leading to the full Falcon?9 complement of nine engines test fired for a full mission length (178?seconds) of the first stage in November 2008.[32] In October 2009, the first flight-ready first stage had a successful all-engine test fire at the company's test stand in McGregor, Texas. In November 2009 SpaceX conducted the initial second stage test firing lasting forty seconds. This test succeeded without aborts or recycles. In January 2010, a full-duration (329 seconds) orbit-insertion firing of the Falcon?9 second stage was conducted at the McGregor test site.[33] The full stack arrived at the launch site for integration at the beginning of February 2010, and SpaceX initially scheduled a launch date of March 2010, though they estimated anywhere between one and three months for integration and testing.[34]\\r\\nIn February 2010, SpaceX's first flight stack was set vertical at Space Launch Complex?40, Cape Canaveral,[35] and on March 9, SpaceX performed a static fire test, where the first stage was to be fired without taking off. The test aborted at T-2?seconds due to a failure in the system designed to pump high-pressure helium from the launch pad into the first stage turbopumps, which would get them spinning in preparation for launch. Subsequent review showed that the failure occurred when a valve did not receive a command to open. As the problem was with the pad and not with the rocket itself, it didn't occur at the McGregor test site, which did not have the same valve setup. Some fire and smoke were seen at the base of the rocket, leading to speculation of an engine fire. However, the fire and smoke were the result of normal burnoff from the liquid oxygen and fuel mix present in the system prior to launch, and no damage was sustained by the vehicle or the test pad. All vehicle systems leading up to the abort performed as expected, and no additional issues were noted that needed addressing. A subsequent test on March?13 was successful in firing the nine first-stage engines for 3.5?seconds.[36]\\r\\nIn December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 (and Dragon spacecraft) every three months, with a plan to double the rate to one every six weeks.[37] By September 2013, SpaceX total manufacturing space had increased to nearly 1,000,000?sq?ft (93,000?m2) and the factory had been configured to achieve a maximum production rate of 40 rocket cores per year.[38] The factory was producing one Falcon 9 vehicle per month as of November 2013. The company planned to increase to 18 vehicles per year in mid-2014, 24 per year by the end of 2014,[39][40] and 40 rocket cores per year by the end of 2015.[41]\\r\\nThese production rates were not achieved by February 2016 as previously planned; the company indicated that production rate for Falcon 9 cores had only recently increased to 18 per year, and the number of first stage cores that can be assembled at one time had doubled from three to six. The production rate was expected to grow to 30 cores per year by the end of 2016,[42] but as of August?2016[update], SpaceX was working towards a production capacity of 40 cores per year,[43] the full factory capacity envisioned in 2013.[38]\\r\\nRockets from the Falcon 9 family have been launched 47 times over 7 years, resulting in 44 confirmed full mission successes (7001936000000000000?93.6% success rate), one partial success (with primary orbital payload delivery completed, but a secondary payload left in a lower-than-planned orbit), one failure (with total loss of spacecraft), and the recent Zuma satellite unofficially reported lost despite SpaceX claiming nominal launch performance.[44] Additionally, one rocket and payload were destroyed before launch in preparation for an on-pad static fire test. 21 of 26 landing attempts (7001810000000000000?81%) have succeeded in recovering the rocket's first stage, including the 17 latest ones.\\r\\nThe first rocket version Falcon 9 v1.0 was launched 5 times from June 2010 to March 2013, its successor Falcon 9 v1.1 15 times from September 2013 to January 2016 and the latest upgrade Falcon 9 Full Thrust 27 times from December 2015 to present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Falcon 9 is a two-stage, LOX/RP-1-powered heavy-lift launch vehicle. Both stages are equipped with Merlin 1D rocket engines; nine sea-level adapted versions on the first stage and one vacuum adapted version on the second stage. Every engine utilises a pyrophoric mixture of triethylaluminum-triethylborane (TEA-TEB) as an engine igniter.[51] The first stage engines are arranged in a structural form SpaceX calls \\"Octaweb\\".[52] Many cores include four extensible landing legs attached around the base of the Octaweb.[53] To control the descent of the boosters and center core through the atmosphere, SpaceX often uses grid fins which deploy from the vehicle after separation.[54] The legs will then deploy as the boosters return to Earth, landing each softly on the ground.[55]\\r\\nThe propellant tank walls and domes are made from aluminium-lithium alloy. SpaceX uses an all friction-stir welded tank, the highest strength and most reliable welding technique available.[4] The second stage tank of a Falcon?9 is simply a shorter version of the first stage tank and uses most of the same tooling, material and manufacturing techniques, reducing production costs.[4] The Falcon 9 interstage, which connects the upper and lower stage, is a carbon-fiber aluminum-core composite structure. Reusable separation collets and a pneumatic pusher system separate the stages. The original design stage separation system had twelve attachment points, which was reduced to just three in the v1.1 launcher.[56]\\r\\nThe Falcon 9 uses a payload fairing to protect (non-Dragon) satellites during launch. The fairing is 13?m (43?ft) long, 5.2?m (17?ft) in diameter, and is constructed of carbon fiber skin overlaid on an aluminum honeycomb core. SpaceX designed and fabricates fairings at their headquarters in Hawthorne, California. Testing of the design was completed at NASA's Plum Brook Station facility in spring 2013 where the acoustic shock and mechanical vibration of launch, plus electromagnetic static discharge conditions, were simulated on a full-size test article in a very large vacuum chamber.[57]\\r\\nSpaceX uses multiple redundant flight computers in a fault-tolerant design. Each Merlin rocket engine is controlled by three voting computers, each of which has two physical processors that constantly check each other. The software runs on Linux and is written in C++.[58] For flexibility, commercial off-the-shelf parts and system-wide radiation-tolerant design are used instead of rad-hardened parts.[58] Each stage has stage-level flight computers, in addition to the Merlin-specific engine controllers, of the same fault-tolerant triad design to handle stage control functions.\\r\\nSpaceX had predicted that its launches would have high reliability based on the philosophy that \\"through simplicity, reliability and low cost can go hand-in-hand\\" by 2011.[59] As of 8?January?2018[update] Falcon 9 has achieved 46 out of 48 primary missions, with one rocket destroyed in flight and one on the launch pad during fueling for an engine test, yielding a success rate of 7001958000000000000?95.8%. For comparison, present industry benchmark, the Russian Soyuz series has more than 1,700 launches[60] with a success rate of 7001974000000000000?97.4%.[61]\\r\\nAs with the company's smaller Falcon 1 vehicle, Falcon 9's launch sequence includes a hold-down feature that allows full engine ignition and systems check before liftoff. After first-stage engine start, the launcher is held down and not released for flight until all propulsion and vehicle systems are confirmed to be operating normally. Similar hold-down systems have been used on other launch vehicles such as the Saturn V[62] and Space Shuttle. An automatic safe shut-down and unloading of propellant occurs if any abnormal conditions are detected.[4] Prior to the launch date, SpaceX always completes a test of the Falcon 9 culminating in a firing of the first stage's Merlin 1D engines for three-and-a-half seconds to verify performance.[63]\\r\\nFalcon 9 has triple redundant flight computers and inertial navigation, with a GPS overlay for additional orbit insertion accuracy.[4]\\r\\nLike the Saturn rocket series from the Apollo program, the presence of multiple first-stage engines allow for mission completion even if one of the first-stage engines fails during flight.[4][64] Detailed descriptions of several aspects of destructive engine failure modes and designed-in engine-out capabilities were made public by SpaceX in a 2007 \\"update\\" that was publicly released.[65]\\r\\nSpaceX emphasized over several years that the Falcon 9 first stage is designed for engine out capability.[4] The SpaceX CRS-1 mission in October 2012 was a partial success after an engine failure in the first stage: engine no.?1 experienced a loss of pressure at 79 seconds, and then shut down. To compensate for the resulting loss of acceleration, the first stage had to burn 28 seconds longer than planned, and the second stage had to burn an extra 15 seconds. That extra burn time of the second stage reduced its fuel reserves, so that the likelihood that there was sufficient fuel to reach the planned orbit above the space station with the secondary payload dropped from 99% to 95%. Because NASA had purchased the launch and therefore contractually controlled a number of mission decision points, NASA declined SpaceX's request to restart the second stage and attempt to deliver the secondary payload into the correct orbit. This risk was understood by the secondary payload customer at time of the signing of the launch contract. As a result, the secondary payload satellite reentered the atmosphere a few days after launch.[6]\\r\\nSpaceX intended to recover the first stages of several early Falcon flights to assist engineers in designing for future reusability. They were equipped with parachutes but failed to survive the aerodynamic stress and heating during atmospheric re-entry following stage separation.[66] Although reusability of the second stage is more difficult, SpaceX intended from the beginning to make both stages of the Falcon 9 reusable.[67] Both stages in the early launches were covered with a layer of ablative cork and had parachutes to land them gently in the sea. The stages were also marinized by salt-water corrosion resistant material, anodizing and paying attention to galvanic corrosion.[67] Musk said that if the vehicle does not become reusable, \\"I will consider us to have failed.\\"[68]\\r\\nIn late 2011, SpaceX announced a change in the approach, eliminating the parachutes and going with a propulsively-powered-descent approach.[69][70] Included was a video[71] said to be an approximation depicting the first stage returning tail-first for a powered descent and the second stage, with heat shield, reentering head first before rotating for a powered descent.[70][72] Design was complete on the system for \\"bringing the rocket back to launchpad using only thrusters\\" by February 2012.[55]\\r\\nA reusable first stage was then flight-tested by SpaceX with the suborbital Grasshopper rocket.[73] Between 2012 and 2013, this low-altitude, low-speed demonstration test vehicle made eight VTVL test flights, including a 79-second round-trip flight to an altitude of 744?m (2,441?ft). In March 2013, SpaceX announced that, beginning with the first flight of the Falcon 9 v1.1 (the sixth flight overall of Falcon 9), every first stage would be instrumented and equipped as a controlled descent test vehicle. SpaceX continued their propulsive-return over-water tests, saying they \\"will continue doing such tests until they can do a return to the launch site and a powered landing. ... [SpaceX] expect several failures before they 'learn how to do it right.'\\"[74]\\r\\nFor Falcon 9 Flight 6 in September 2013, after stage separation, the flight test plan called for the first-stage booster to first burn to reduce its reentry velocity, and then effect a second burn just before it reached the water. SpaceX stated they expected several powered-descent tests to achieve successful recovery,[75] before they could then attempt a landing on a solid surface.[74] Although not a complete success, the stage was able to change direction and make a controlled entry into the atmosphere.[76] During the final landing burn, the ACS thrusters could not overcome an aerodynamically induced spin, and centrifugal force deprived the landing engine of fuel leading to early engine shutdown and a hard splashdown that destroyed the first stage.[76]\\r\\nAfter four more ocean landing tests, the first stage of the CRS-5 launch vehicle attempted a landing on a floating landing platform, the \\"Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship\\" (ASDS) in January 2015. The rocket incorporated (for the first time in an orbital mission) grid fin aerodynamic control surfaces, and guided itself to the ship successfully, but ran out of hydraulic fluid and lost its steering ability, destroying it on impact with the landing platform.[77] A second attempt to land on a floating platform occurred in April 2015, on CRS-6. After the launch, Elon Musk communicated that the bipropellant valve had become stuck, and therefore the control system could not react rapidly enough for a successful landing.[78]\\r\\nThe first attempt to land the first stage of Falcon 9 on a ground pad near the launch site occurred on flight 20, the maiden flight of the Falcon 9 Full Thrust version in December 2015. The landing was successful and the first stage was recovered.[79][80] This was the first time in history that a rocket first stage returned to Earth after propelling an orbital launch mission and achieving a controlled vertical landing. The first successful first-stage landing on an ASDS occurred in April 2016 on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You during the CRS-8 mission.\\r\\nIn total, sixteen test flights were conducted from 2013 to 2016, six of which achieved a soft landing and recovery of the booster. Since January 2017, SpaceX has stopped referring to landing attempts as \\"experimental\\" in their press releases, indicating that they are now considered a routine procedure; every landing attempt since has been successful.\\r\\nThe first operational re-use of a previously-flown Falcon 9 booster was successfully accomplished in March 2017[81] with B1021 on the SES-10 mission after CRS-8 in April 2016.[82] The booster landed a second time and was retired.[83] In June 2017, booster B1029 helped carry BulgariaSat-1 towards GTO after an Iridium NEXT LEO mission in January, again achieving the reuse and second landing of a recovered booster.[84] A third reflight of a flight-proven booster was performed in October 2017, on the SES-11/Echostar 105 mission, using the booster originally flown on CRS-10.[85]\\r\\nDespite public statements that they would endeavor to make the Falcon 9 second-stage reusable as well, by late 2014, SpaceX determined that the mass needed for a re-entry heat shield, landing engines, and other equipment to support recovery of the second stage was at that time prohibitive, and indefinitely suspended their second-stage reusability plans for the Falcon line.[13][86] However, in 2017 they indicated that they might do experimental tests on recovering one or more second-stages in order to learn more about reusability to inform their new, much-larger, BFR launch vehicle development process.[87]\\r\\nPayload fairings have survived descent and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. In June 2015, wreckage of an unidentified Falcon 9 launch vehicle was found off the coast of The Bahamas, which was confirmed by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to be a component of the payload fairing that washed ashore. Musk noted the possibility of fairing reusability in a statement: \\"This is helpful for figuring out fairing reusability.\\"[88] In March 2017, SpaceX for the first time recovered a fairing from the SES-10 mission, aided by thrusters and a steerable parachute helping it glide towards a gentle touchdown on water.[47]\\r\\nThe original Falcon 9 v1.0 flew five successful orbital launches in 2010ÿ2013. The much larger Falcon 9 v1.1 made its first flight in September 2013. The demonstration mission carried a very small 500?kg (1,100?lb) primary payload, the CASSIOPE satellite;[56] larger payloads followed for v1.1, starting with the launch of the large SES-8 GEO communications satellite.[89] Both Falcon 9 v1.0 and Falcon 9 v1.1 were expendable launch vehicles (ELVs). The thirdand currentversion of the Falcon 9 is the Falcon 9 Full Thrust which made its first flight in December 2015. The first stage of the Falcon 9 Full Thrust version is reusable.\\r\\nThe first version of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, Falcon 9 v1.0, was an expendable launch vehicle that was developed in 2005ÿ2010, and was launched for the first time in 2010. Falcon 9 v1.0 made five flights in 2010ÿ2013, after which it was retired.\\r\\nThe Falcon 9 v1.0 first stage was powered by nine SpaceX Merlin 1C rocket engines arranged in a 3G3 pattern. Each of these engines had a sea-level thrust of 556?kN (125,000 pounds-force) for a total thrust on liftoff of about 5,000?kN (1,100,000 pounds-force).[4] The Falcon 9 v1.0 second stage was powered by a single Merlin 1C engine modified for vacuum operation, with an expansion ratio of 117:1 and a nominal burn time of 345?seconds. Gaseous N2 thrusters were used on the Falcon 9 v1.0 second-stage as a reaction control system.[90]\\r\\nSpaceX expressed hopes initially that both stages would eventually be reusable.[91] But early results from adding lightweight thermal protection system capability to the booster stage and using parachute recovery were not successful,[66] leading to abandonment of that approach and the initiation of a new design. In 2011, SpaceX began a formal and funded development program for a reusable Falcon 9, with the early program focus however on return of the first stage.[55]\\r\\nThe Falcon 9 v1.1 ELV is a 60 percent heavier rocket with 60 percent more thrust than the v1.0 version of the Falcon 9.[56] It includes realigned first-stage engines[92] and 60 percent longer fuel tanks, making it more susceptible to bending during flight.[56] Development testing of the v1.1 first stage was completed in July 2013.[93][94] The Falcon 9 v1.1, first launched in September 2013, uses a longer first stage powered by nine Merlin 1D engines arranged in an \\"octagonal\\" pattern,[95][96] that SpaceX calls Octaweb. This is designed to simplify and streamline the manufacturing process.[97]\\r\\nThe v1.1 first stage has a total sea-level thrust at liftoff of 5,885?kN (1,323,000?lbf), with the nine engines burning for a nominal 180 seconds, while stage thrust rises to 6,672?kN (1,500,000?lbf) as the booster climbs out of the atmosphere.[3] The engines have been upgraded to the more powerful Merlin 1D. These improvements increased the payload capability from 9,000?kg (20,000?lb) to 13,150?kg (28,990?lb).[3] The stage separation system has been redesigned and reduces the number of attachment points from twelve to three,[56] and the vehicle has upgraded avionics and software as well.[56] Following the September 2013 launch, the second stage igniter propellant lines were insulated to better support in-space restart following long coast phases for orbital trajectory maneuvers.[39]\\r\\nSpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell has stated the Falcon 9 v1.1 has about 30 percent more payload capacity than published on its standard price list, the extra margin reserved for returning of stages via powered re-entry.[98] Four extensible carbon fiber with aluminum honeycomb landing legs were included on later flights where landings were attempted.[99][74][75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Full Thrust upgrade\\" version[100][101]the third major version of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle following the Falcon 9 v1.0 (launched 2010ÿ2013) and the Falcon 9 v1.1 (launched 2013 ÿ January 2016)has cryogenic cooling of propellant to increase density allowing 17% higher thrust, an improved stage separation system, a stretched upper stage that can hold additional propellant, and strengthened struts for holding helium bottles believed to have been involved with the failure of flight 19.[102]\\r\\nSpaceX pricing and payload specifications published for the non-reusable Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket as of March?2014[update] actually included about 30 percent more performance than the published price list indicated; the additional performance was reserved for SpaceX to do reusability testing with the Falcon 9 v1.1 while still achieving the specified payloads for customers. Many engineering changes to support reusability and recovery of the first stage had been made on the v1.1 version and testing was successful, with SpaceX having room to increase the payload performance for the Full Thrust version, or decrease launch price, or both.[103]\\r\\nThe Full Thrust version of the rocket has a reusable first stage after achieving its first successful landing in December 2015[104] and first reflight in March 2017.[105] However, plans to reuse the Falcon 9 second-stage booster have been abandoned as the weight of a heat shield and other equipment would impinge on payload too much for this to be economically feasible for this rocket.[13] The reusable booster stage was developed using systems and software tested on the Grasshopper and F9R Dev technology demonstrators, as well as a set of technologies being developed by SpaceX to facilitate rapid reusability.\\r\\nIn February 2017, SpaceXs CRS-10 launch was the first operational launch utilizing the new Autonomous Flight Safety System (AFSS) that is built into Falcon 9 Full Thrust launch vehicles. For all SpaceX launches after 16 March 2017, the autonomous AFSS has replaced \\"the ground-based mission flight control personnel and equipment with on-board Positioning, Navigation and Timing sources and decision logic. The benefits of AFSS include increased public safety, reduced reliance on range infrastructure, reduced range spacelift cost, increased schedule predictability and availability, operational flexibility, and launch slot flexibility.\\"[106]\\r\\nOn the June 25, 2017 mission carrying the second batch of ten Iridium NEXT satellites, aluminum grid fins were replaced by titanium versions, to improve control authority and better cope with heat during re-entry.[107]\\r\\nIn 2017, SpaceX started including incremental changes to the Falcon 9 Full Thrust, internally calling it the \\"Block 4\\" version.[108] Initially only the second stage was modified to Block 4 standards, flying on top of a \\"Block 3\\" first stage for three missions: NROL-76 and Inmarsat-5 F4 in May 2017, and Intelsat 35e in July.[109] Block 4 was described as a transition between the Full Thrust v1.2 \\"Block 3\\" and the forthcoming Falcon 9 Block 5. It includes incremental engine thrust upgrades leading to the final planned thrust for Block 5.[110] The maiden flight of the full Block 4 design (first and second stages) was the NASA CRS-12 mission on August 14, 2017.[111]\\r\\nIn October 2016, Musk described a Falcon 9 \\"Block 5\\"[clarification needed] version that would have \\"a lot of minor refinements that collectively are important, but uprated thrust and improved legs are the most significant.\\"[112] In January 2017 Musk added that the Block 5 version \\"[s]ignificantly improves performance & ease of reusability\\".[113] He described this version as the \\"final\\" version of the rocket.[112] Its maiden flight is planned for April 2018, which according to known launch schedules, would imply the launch of Iridium NEXT 51ÿ55 and GRACE-FO 1 and 2.[114]\\r\\n7,607[10][119] (late 2016)\\r\\nAs of January?2018[update], the Falcon 9 has launched from three orbital launch sites: Launch Complex 39A of the Kennedy Space Center,[124] Space Launch Complex 4E of the Vandenberg Air Force Base,[68][76] and Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station; the latter was damaged in the Amos-6 accident in September 2016, but is operational again since December 2017.[125][126] SpaceX is also building a commercial-only launch facility at the Boca Chica site near Brownsville, Texas,[127][42] from which the Falcon 9 was previously expected to launch beginning in late 2018.[needs update]\\r\\nAt the time of the rocket's maiden flight in 2010, the price of a Falcon 9 v1.0 launch was listed from $49.9 to $56 million.[4] By 2012, the listed price range had increased to $54ÿ$59.5 million.[128] In August 2013, the initial list price for a Falcon 9 v1.1 was $56.5 million;[129] it was raised to $61.2 million by June 2014.[130] Since May 2016, the standard price for a Falcon 9 Full Thrust mission (allowing booster recovery) is published as $62 million.[1] Dragon cargo missions to the ISS have an average cost of $133 million under a fixed price contract with NASA, including the cost of the capsule.[131] The DSCOVR mission, also launched with Falcon 9 for NOAA, cost $97 million[132]\\r\\nIn 2004, Elon Musk stated, \\"long term plans call for development of a heavy lift product and even a super-heavy, if there is customer demand. [...] Ultimately, I believe $500 per pound ($1100/kg) [of payload delivered to orbit] or less is very achievable.\\"[133] At its 2016 launch price and at full LEO payload capacity, the Falcon 9 FT cost $2,719 per kilogram ($1,233/lb) for the expendable version. In comparison, at full GTO payload capacity, the Falcon 9 FT cost $7,470 per kilogram ($3,390/lb) for the expendable version and $11,273 per kilogram ($5,113/lb) for the 1st launch of the reusable version.\\r\\nIn 2011, Musk estimated that fuel and oxidizer for the Falcon 9 v1.0 rocket cost a total of about $200,000.[134] The first stage uses 150,000?L (39,000?US?gal) of liquid oxygen and almost 95,000?L (25,000?US?gal) of RP-1 fuel, while the second stage uses 28,000?L (7,300?US?gal) of liquid oxygen and 17,000?L (4,600?US?gal) of RP-1.[1]\\r\\nFalcon 9 payload services include secondary and tertiary payload connection via an EELV Secondary Payload Adapter ring, the same interstage adapter first used for launching secondary payloads on US DoD missions that use the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELV) Atlas V and Delta IV. This enables secondary and even tertiary missions with minimal impact to the original mission. In 2011, SpaceX announced pricing for ESPA-compatible payloads on the Falcon 9.[135]","input":"What is the spacex falcon 9 rocket for?"},{"output":"the El Rancho Vegas","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Las Vegas Strip is a stretch of South Las Vegas Boulevard in Clark County, Nevada that is known for its concentration of resort hotels and casinos. The Strip is approximately 4.2 miles (6.8?km) in length,[1] located immediately south of the Las Vegas city limits in the unincorporated towns of Paradise and Winchester. However, the Strip is often referred to as being in Las Vegas.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the largest hotel, casino, and resort properties in the world are located on the Strip. The boulevard's cityscape is highlighted by its use of contemporary architecture, lights, and a wide variety of attractions. Its hotels, casinos, restaurants, residential high-rises, entertainment offerings, and skyline have established the Strip as one of the most popular and iconic tourist destinations in the world.[2] Most of the Strip has also been designated as an All-American Road[3][4] and is considered a scenic route at night.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, the casinos that were not in Downtown Las Vegas along Fremont Street were limited to outside the city limits on Las Vegas Boulevard. In 1959, the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign was constructed exactly 4.5 miles (7.2?km) outside the city limits. The sign is today located in the median just south of Russell Road, across from the now-demolished Klondike Hotel & Casino, about 0.4 miles (0.64?km) south of the southernmost entrance to Mandalay Bay (the southernmost casino).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the strictest sense, \\"the Strip\\" refers only to the stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard that is roughly between Sahara Avenue and Russell Road, a distance of 4.2 miles (6.8?km).[7][8] However, the term is often used to refer not only to the road but also to the various casinos and resorts that line the road, and even to properties that are not on the road but are in proximity to it. Phrases such as Strip Area, Resort Corridor or Resort District are sometimes used to indicate a larger geographical area, including properties 1 mile (1.6?km) or more away from Las Vegas Boulevard, such as the Hard Rock, Rio, Palms, and Hooters casinos.\\r\\n\\r\\nA long-standing definition considers the Strip's northern terminus as the SLS, though travel guides typically extend it to include the Stratosphere 0.4 miles (0.64?km) to the north. Mandalay Bay, located just north of Russell Road, is the southernmost resort considered to be on the Strip (the Klondike was the southernmost until 2006, when it was closed, although it was not included in the Strip on some definitions and travel guides).\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the number and size of the resorts, the resort corridor can be quite wide. Interstate 15 runs roughly parallel and 0.5 to 0.8 miles (0.80 to 1.29?km) to the west of Las Vegas Boulevard for the entire length of the Strip. Paradise Road runs to the east in a similar fashion, and ends at St. Louis Avenue. The eastern side of the Strip is bounded by McCarran International Airport south of Tropicana Avenue.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth of this point, the resort corridor can be considered to extend as far east as Paradise Road, although some consider Koval Lane as a less inclusive boundary. Interstate 15 is sometimes considered the western edge of the resort corridor from Interstate 215 to Spring Mountain Road. North of this point, Industrial Road serves as the western edge.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewer hotels and resorts such as South Point, Grandview Resort, and M Resort are on Las Vegas Boulevard South as distant as 8 miles south of the \\"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\\" sign. Marketing for these casinos usually states that they are on southern Las Vegas Boulevard and not \\"Strip\\" properties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first casino to be built on Highway 91 was the Pair-o-Dice Club in 1931, but the first resort on what is currently the Strip was the El Rancho Vegas, opening on April 3, 1941, with 63 rooms. That casino/ resort stood for almost 20 years before being destroyed by a fire in 1960. Its success spawned a second hotel on what would become the Strip, the Hotel Last Frontier in 1942. Organized crime figures such as New York's Bugsy Siegel took interest in the growing gaming center leading to other resorts such as the Flamingo, which opened in 1946, and the Desert Inn, which opened in 1950. The funding for many projects was provided through the American National Insurance Company, which was based in the then notorious gambling empire of Galveston, Texas.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nLas Vegas Boulevard South was previously called Arrowhead Highway, or Los Angeles Highway. The Strip was named by Los Angeles police officer and businessman Guy McAfee, after his hometown's Sunset Strip.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nCaesars Palace was established in 1966. In 1968, Kirk Kerkorian purchased the Flamingo and hired Sahara Hotels Vice President Alex Shoofey as President. Alex Shoofey brought along 33 of Sahara's top executives. The Flamingo was used to train future employees of the International Hotel, which was under construction. Opening in 1969, the International Hotel, with 1,512 rooms, began the era of mega-resorts. The International is known as Westgate Las Vegas today.\\r\\nThe first MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, also a Kerkorian property, opened in 1973 with 2,084 rooms. At the time, this was one of the largest hotels in the world by number of rooms. The Rossiya Hotel built in 1967 in Moscow, for instance, had 3,200 rooms; however, most of the rooms in the Rossiya Hotel were single rooms of 118 sq. ft (roughly 1/4 size of a standard room at the MGM Grand Resort). On November 21, 1980, the MGM Grand suffered the worst resort fire in the history of Las Vegas as a result of electrical problems, killing 87 people. It reopened eight months later. In 1986, Kerkorian sold the MGM Grand to Bally Manufacturing, and it was renamed Bally's.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wet 'n Wild water park opened in 1985 and was located on the south side of the Sahara hotel. It closed at the end of the 2004 season and was later demolished. The opening of The Mirage in 1989 set a new level to the Las Vegas experience, as smaller hotels and casinos made way for the larger mega-resorts. The Rio and the Excalibur opened in 1990. These huge facilities offer entertainment and dining options, as well as gambling and lodging. This change affected the smaller, well-known and now historic hotels and casinos, like The Dunes, The Sands, the Stardust, and the Sahara.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lights along the Strip have been dimmed in a sign of respect to six performers and one other major Las Vegas figure upon their deaths. They are Elvis Presley (1977), Sammy Davis Jr. (1990),[12] Dean Martin (1995), George Burns (1996), Frank Sinatra (1998), former UNLV basketball head coach Jerry Tarkanian (2015),[13] and Don Rickles (2017).[14] The Strip lights were dimmed later in 2017 as a memorial to victims of a mass shooting at a concert held adjacent to the Strip.[15]  In 2005, Clark County renamed a section of Industrial Road (south of Twain Avenue) as Dean Martin Drive, also as a tribute to the famous Rat Pack singer, actor, and frequent Las Vegas entertainer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an effort to attract families, resorts offered more attractions geared toward youth, but had limited success. The (current) MGM Grand opened in 1993 with MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park, but the park closed in 2000 due to lack of interest. Similarly, in 2003 Treasure Island closed its own video arcade and abandoned the previous pirate theme, adopting the new ti name.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the large hotels, casinos and resorts, the Strip is home to a few smaller casinos and other attractions, such as M&M's World, Adventuredome and the Fashion Show Mall. Starting in the mid-1990s, the Strip became a popular New Year's Eve celebration destination.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the opening of Bellagio, Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn and Encore resorts, the strip trended towards the luxurious high end segment through most of the 2000s, while some older resorts added major expansions and renovations, including some de-theming of the earlier themed hotels. High end dining, specialty retail, spas and nightclubs increasingly became options for visitors in addition to gambling at most Strip resorts. There was also a trend towards expensive residential condo units on the strip.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, MGM Mirage announced plans for CityCenter, a 66-acre (27?ha), $7?billion multi-use project on the site of the Boardwalk hotel and adjoining land. It consists of hotel, casino, condo, retail, art, business and other uses on the site. City Center is currently the largest such complex in the world. Construction began in April 2006, with most elements of the project opened in late 2009. Also in 2006, the Las Vegas Strip lost its longtime status as the world's highest-grossing gambling center, falling to second place behind Macau.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, the High Roller Ferris wheel and a retail district called The LINQ Promenade broke ground, in an attempt to diversify attractions beyond that of casino resorts. Renovations and rebrandings such as The Cromwell Las Vegas and the SLS Las Vegas continued to transform The Strip in 2014. The Las Vegas Festival Grounds opened in 2015. In 2016, the T-Mobile Arena, The Park, and the Park Theatre opened. Smaller changes and developments are taking place as well.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 1, 2017, a mass shooting occurred on the Strip at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival, adjacent to the Mandalay Bay hotel. This incident became the deadliest mass shooting in modern United States history.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nRTC Transit (previously Citizens Area Transit, or CAT) provides bus service on the Strip with double decker buses known as The Deuce. The Deuce runs between Mandalay Bay at the southern end of the Strip (and to the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign and South Strip Transfer Terminal after midnight) to the Bonneville Transit Center (BTC) and the Fremont Street Experience in Downtown Las Vegas, with stops near every casino. RTC also operates an express bus called the Strip and Downtown Express (SDX). This route connects the Strip to the Las Vegas Convention Center and Downtown Las Vegas to the north, with stops at selected hotels and shopping attractions (Las Vegas Premium Outlets North & South).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile not on the Strip itself, the Las Vegas Monorail runs on the east side of the Strip corridor from Tropicana Avenue to Sahara Avenue.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral free trams operate on the west side of the Strip:\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to CAT bus service beginning operations in 1992, mass transit on the Strip was provided by a private transit company, Las Vegas Transit.

Some feature designs that match the theme of the nearby resorts. The Tropicana ÿ Las Vegas Boulevard footbridges were the first to be installed, and based on the success of this project additional footbridges have been built on Las Vegas Boulevard at the Flamingo Road intersection connecting Bellagio, Caesars Palace, Bally's, and The Cromwell; between The Mirage/Treasure Island and The Venetian, and at the Las Vegas Boulevard-Spring Mountain and Sands Avenue intersection connecting the Wynn with the Fashion Show Mall, The Palazzo and Treasure Island. The latest to be completed connects Planet Hollywood, CityCenter and The Cosmopolitan at the Harmon Avenue intersection.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority's annual Las Vegas Visitor Profile Study, only 36% of people said they walked around the Strip, a figure that is a drop from 2013 (52%).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, Bali Hai Golf Club opened just south of Mandalay Bay and the Strip.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs land values on the Strip have increased over the years, the resort-affiliated golf courses been removed to make way for building projects. The Tropicana Country Club closed in 1990[33] and the Dunes golf course in the mid-90s. Steve Wynn, founder of previously owned Mirage Resorts, purchased the Desert Inn and golf course for his new company Wynn Resorts and redeveloped the course as the Wynn Golf Club. This course closed in 2017. The Aladdin also had a nine-hole golf course in the 1960's.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, a TopGolf opened near the Strip.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strip is home to many amusement parks and rides. These include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Las Vegas Strip is well known for its lounges, showrooms, theaters and nightclubs;[38] most of the attractions and shows on the Strip are located on the hotel casino properties. Some of the more popular free attractions visible from the Strip include the water fountains at  Bellagio, the volcano at The Mirage, and the Fall of Atlantis and Festival Fountain at Caesars Palace. There are several Cirque du Soleil shows, such as K at the MGM Grand, O at Bellagio, Mystre at Treasure Island, Zumanity (for ages 18 and older) at New York-New York, Criss Angel Mindfreak at the Luxor, and Michael Jackson: One at Mandalay Bay.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany notable artists have performed in Las Vegas, including Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Wayne Newton, Liza Minnelli, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and Liberace,[40] and in more recent years Celine Dion, Britney Spears, Barry Manilow, Cher, Elton John, Bette Midler, Donny and Marie Osmond, Garth Brooks, Jennifer Lopez, Reba McEntire, Mariah Carey, Shania Twain, Criss Angel, and Olivia Newton-John have had residencies in the various resorts on the Strip. The only movie theatre directly on the Strip was the 10-screen Regal Showcase Theatre in the Showcase Mall. The theater opened in 1997 and was operated by Regal Entertainment Group,[41] until its closure in 2018.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Strip is home to many entertainment venues.

USGBC is best known for its development of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building rating systems and its annual Greenbuild International Conference and Expo, the worlds largest conference and expo dedicated to green building. USGBC was one of eight national councils that helped found the World Green Building Council (WorldGBC). Mr Mahesh Ramanujam has become the new CEO of USGBC by taking charge in November 2016.\\r\\nThrough its partnership with the Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI), USGBC offers a suite of LEED professional credentials that denote expertise in the field of green building. USGBC incentivizes LEED certification by awarding extra certification points to building projects completed with a LEED-certified professional on staff.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe LEED Green Building Rating System (LEED) is a program that provides third-party verification of green buildings. The LEED rating systems address both a wide variety of buildings types, including commercial buildings, homes, neighborhoods, retail, healthcare, and schools, as well as every phase of the building lifecycle including design, construction, operations and maintenance.[2] Projects may earn one of four levels of LEED certification (Certified, Silver, Gold or Platinum) by achieving a given number of point-based credits within the rating system.\\r\\nDevelopment of LEED began in 1993, spearheaded by Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) senior scientist Robert K. Watson. As founding chairman of the LEED Steering Committee, Watson led a broad-based consensus process until 2007, bringing together non-profit organizations, government agencies, architects, engineers, developers, builders, product manufacturers and other industry leaders. The LEED initiative was supported by a strong USGBC Board of Directors, chaired by Steven Winter from 1999 to 2003, and very active staff, including Nigel Howard.[3] At that time, USGBCs Senior Vice President of LEED, Scot Horst, became chair of the LEED Steering Committee before joining USGBC staff. Early LEED committee members also included USGBC co-founder Mike Italiano, architects Bill Reed and Sandy Mendler, builder Gerard Heiber and Myron Kibbe and engineer Richard Bourne. As interest in LEED grew, in 1996, engineers Tom Paladino and Lynn Barker co-chaired the newly formed LEED technical committee.\\r\\nBeginning with its launch in 2000, LEED has grown from one rating system for new construction to a comprehensive system of nine interrelated rating systems covering all aspects of the development and construction process.[2] Since its inception, LEED has grown from six volunteers on one committee to more than 200 volunteers on nearly 20 committees and nearly 200 professional staff.\\r\\nUSGBC was awarded the American Architectural Foundations Keystone Award in 2012. The National Building Museum presented the USGBC with its 2009 Honor Award (themed \\"Visionaries in Sustainability\\"), citing the organization's \\"exceptional achievement in establishing and integrating green building standards\\" in its LEED systems as one of the reasons for selection.[4] The museum also awarded USGBC with its Henry C. Turner Prize in 2005 for its leadership and innovation in the construction industry, specifically for LEED.[5] To date, it is the only organization to have received two awards from the Building Museum.\\r\\nLEED standards have been criticized for not actually creating energy efficient buildings. In 2013, The Washington Examiner analyzed energy efficiency data of New York City buildings and found that LEED-certified buildings actually performed worse than buildings in general.[6] An analysis by USA Today found that building makers target LEEDs easiest pointsthose that dont necessarily increase the energy efficiency of a building.[7]\\r\\nOn May 23, 2013, Rep. David McKinley introduced the Better Buildings Act of 2014 (H.R. 2126; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives.

It is located between Muswell Hill and Wood Green, in the north of the city. It was originally built by John Johnson and Alfred Meeson and opened in 1873 but was rebuilt, solely by Johnson, in 1875 following a fire. It was originally designed to serve as a public centre of recreation, education and entertainment and as North London's counterpart to The Crystal Palace in South London.\\r\\nIntended as \\"The People's Palace\\" and later nicknamed \\"Ally Pally\\" (supposedly by Gracie Fields),[2] in 1936 it became the home of the world's first regular public \\"high-definition\\"[3] television service, operated by the BBC. Although other facilities soon superseded it after the war, Alexandra Palace continued to be used by the BBC for many years and its radio and television mast is still in use. The original studios 'A' and 'B' still survive in the south-east wing with their producers' galleries and are used for exhibiting original historical television equipment. The original Victorian theatre with its stage machinery also survives. The theatre and stage structure is on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk register. Alexandra Palace became a listed building in 1996,[4] at the instigation of the Hornsey Historical Society.\\r\\nA planned commercial development of the building into a mixed leisure complex including a hotel, replacement ice-skating rink, cinema, ten-pin bowling alley and exhibition centre, encountered opposition from public groups and was blocked by the High Court in 2007.\\r\\nThe Great Hall and West Hall are typically used for exhibitions, music concerts and conferences, operated by the trading arm of the charitable trust that owns the building and park on behalf of the public. There is also a pub, ice rink and palm court.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Palace of the People\\" was conceived by Owen Jones in 1859. The Great Northern Palace Company had been established by 1860, but was initially unable to raise financing for the construction of the Palace. Construction materials were acquired and recycled from the large 1862 International Exhibition building in South Kensington after it was demolished: the Government had declined to take it over. Alexandra Park was opened to the public on 23 July 1863. The planned building was originally named \\"The Palace of the People\\"; it and its park were renamed to commemorate the popular new Princess of Wales, Alexandra of Denmark, who had married Prince Edward on 10 March 1863. The Palace of the People, or the People's Palace, remained as alternative names. In September 1865 construction commenced but to a design by John Johnson and Alfred Meeson rather than a glass structure initially proposed by Owen Jones.[5]\\r\\nThe structure covers some 7.5 acres (3.0?ha). In 1871, work started on a railway line to connect the site to Highgate station. Work on both the railway and the palace was completed in 1873 and, on 24 May of that year, Alexandra Palace and Park was opened. The palace was built by Kelk and Lucas, who also built the Royal Albert Hall in South Kensington at around the same time.[6] Sims Reeves sang on the opening day before an audience of 102,000.[7] Only 16 days later, Alexandra Palace was destroyed by a fire which also killed three members of staff. Only the outer walls survived; a loan exhibition of a collection of English pottery and porcelain, comprising some 4,700 items of historic and intrinsic value, was also destroyed.[8]\\r\\nWith typical Victorian vigour, it was quickly rebuilt and reopened on 1 May 1875. The new Alexandra Palace contained a concert hall, art galleries, a museum, lecture hall, library, banqueting room and large theatre. The stage of the theatre incorporated machinery which enabled special effects for the pantomimes and melodramas then popular ÿ artists could disappear, reappear and be propelled into the air. The theatre was also used for political meetings. An open-air swimming pool was constructed at the base of the hill in the surrounding park; it is long since closed and little trace remains except some reeds. The grounds included a horse racing course with grandstand (named Alexandra Park Racecourse and nicknamed the \\"Frying Pan\\" and the \\"Pan Handle\\" because of its layout), which was London's only racecourse from 1868 until its closure in 1970, a Japanese village, a switchback ride, a boating lake and a 9-hole pitch-and-putt golf course. Alexandra Park cricket and football clubs have also played within the grounds (in the middle of the old racecourse) since 1888. A Henry Willis organ installed in 1875, vandalised in 1918 and restored and reopened in 1929, survives. In its 1929 restored form, Willis's masterpiece was declared by Marcel Dupr to be the finest concert-organ in Europe.[9]\\r\\nIn 1900, the owners of Alexandra Palace and Park were threatening to sell them for redevelopment, but a consortium of public-spirited men in the district, headed by Mr. Henry Burt, JP a member of the Middlesex County Council and of Hornsey District Council, at once embraced the opportunity of securing the palace and the beautiful grounds for the people of London. A committee was formed by Burt and the consortium managed to raise enough money to purchase them just in time. By the Alexandra Park and Palace (Public Purposes) Act 1900, a charitable trust was created; representatives of the purchasing local authorities became the trustees with the duty to keep both building and park \\"available for the free use and recreation of the public forever\\". In 1921 a plaque was erected at the entrance of the south terrace in honour of Burt. His subsequent services and financial help should here be recorded and his name held in remembrance by all who appreciate this great public possession. It is this duty that the present trustee, the London Borough of Haringey, is currently trying to overturn, protesters fear,[10] by selling the building to a commercial developer.[11] The palace passed into the hands of the Greater London Council in 1967, with the proviso that it should be used entirely for charitable purposes, and their trusteeship was transferred to Haringey council in 1980.\\r\\nDuring the First World War the park was closed and the palace and grounds were first used as refugee camp for displaced Belgians,[12] and then later from 1915ÿ19 as an internment camp[13] for German and Austrian civilians.[14][15] The camp commandant was Lt. Col. R. S. F. Walker until his death in May 1917.[16]\\r\\nIn 1935, the trustees leased part of the palace to the BBC for use as the production and transmission centre for their new BBC Television Service. The antenna was designed by Charles Samuel Franklin of the Marconi Company. The world's first public broadcasts of (then) \\"high-definition\\" television were made from Alexandra Palace in 1936,[17] an event which is alluded to by the rays in the modern coat of arms of the London Borough of Haringey.[18] Two competing systems, Marconi-EMI's 405-line system and John Logie Baird's 240-line system, were installed, each with its own broadcast studio and were transmitted on alternate weeks until the 405-line system was chosen in 1937.[17] The palace continued as the BBC's main transmitting centre for London until 1956, interrupted only by the Second World War when the transmitter found an alternative use jamming German bombers' navigation systems.[citation needed] In 1944, a German doodlebug exploded just outside the organ end of the Great Hall and blew in the Rose Window, leaving the organ exposed to the elements.[19]\\r\\nIn the early 1960s, an outside broadcast was made from the top of the tower, in which the first passage of a satellite across the London sky was watched and described. It continued to be used for BBC News broadcasts until 1969, and for the Open University until the early 1980s. The antenna mast still stands and is used for local terrestrial television transmission, local commercial radio and DAB broadcasts. The main London television transmitter is now at Crystal Palace in south London.\\r\\nEarly in 1980 Haringey council took over the trusteeship of Alexandra Palace from the GLC and decided to refurbish the building. But just six months later, during Capital Radio's Jazz Festival, a fire started under the organ and quickly spread. It destroyed half the building. Again the outer walls survived and the eastern parts, including the theatre and the BBC Television studios and aerial mast, were saved. Parts of the famous organ were destroyed, though it had been dismantled for repairs so some parts (including nearly all the pipework) were away from the building in store. Some of the damage to the palace was repaired immediately but Haringey council overspent on the restoration, creating a S30 million deficit. It was then reopened to the public in 1988 under a new management team headed by Louis Bizat. Later the council was heavily criticised for the overspend in a report by Project Management International.[20]\\r\\nIn 1991, the attorney-general stated that the overspending by the council as trustee was unlawful and so could not be charged to the charity. The council for some years did not accept this politically embarrassing finding and instead maintained that the charity \\"owed\\" the council S30 million, charged compound interest on what it termed a \\"debt\\" (which eventually rose to a claim of some S60 million), and to recoup it tried to offer the whole palace for sale  a policy their successors are still trying to carry out despite being rejected by the High Court in October 2007. As of June 2008, it is still unclear whether the council in either of its guises has agreed to write off its 1980s overspend.\\r\\nAn ice rink was installed at Alexandra Palace in 1990. Primarily intended for public skating, it has also housed ice hockey teams including the Haringey Racers, the Haringey Greyhounds, the London Racers and now the Haringey Huskies,[21] as well as a figure skating club, the Alexandra Palace Amateur Ice Skating Club. During the 1940s and 50s the palace also housed a public roller-skating rink.\\r\\nThe theatre was greatly altered in the early 1920s, with the general manager, W. J. MacQueen-Pope, spending the war reparation money on refurbishing the auditorium. He abandoned the understage machinery that produced the effects necessary in Victorian melodrama; some of the machinery is preserved, and there is a project to restore some of it to working order. After these changes, the theatre was leased by Archie Pitt, then husband of Gracie Fields, who appeared in the theatre. Fields also drew an audience of 5,000 people to the hall for a charity event. After the BBC leased the eastern part of the palace the theatre was only used for props storage space.\\r\\nIn June 2004, the first performances for about 70 years took place in the theatre, first in its foyer then in July in the theatre itself. Although conditions were far from ideal, the audience was able to see the potential of this very large space ÿ originally seating 3,000, it cannot currently be licensed for more than a couple of hundred. It is intended that the theatre will one day reopen, but much costly restoration will be required first. It will never again reach a seating capacity of 3,000 (not least because one balcony was removed in the early part of the 20th century as a fire precaution, when films started to be shown there), but it does seem likely that a capacity of more than 1,000 may one day be achieved. A major season of the theatre company Complicite was planned for 2005 but the project, which would have included some repair and access work, was cancelled due to higher-than-anticipated costs.[22]\\r\\nPlans by the current trustees, Haringey Council, to replace all the charitable uses by commercial ones by a commercial lease of the entire building, including a casino, encountered considerable public and legal opposition, and on 5 October 2007, in the High Court, Mr. Justice Sullivan granted an application by Jacob O'Callaghan, a London resident, to quash the Charity Commission's order authorising a 125-year lease of the entire building to Firoka Ltd.[23]\\r\\nA masterplan for the future of the site was drawn up in 2012, comprising six 'big ideas' to restore and redevelop the palace.[24] The first of these to be implemented aims to transform the derelict eastern end of the palace, making accessible the Victorian theatre and historic BBC Studios. In 2013 the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded a Round 1 pass to develop the proposals, creating a new entrance in the restored East Court, re-establishing the theatre as a flexible performance space and re-opening the BBC Studios as a visitor attraction. There is currently controversy regarding plans to demolish the brick infills in the colonnade on the south-east face of the building, which the BBC constructed after 1936 to form their television studios within.[25] Following a public consultation and advice from English Heritage, Planning and Listed Building Consent was given for the proposals and in March 2015 HLF awarded Round 2 major grant funding securing a positive future for the historic areas.[26]\\r\\nAlexandra Palace has hosted a number of significant events over the course of its history. Recurring events held there include the Great British Beer Festival (1977ÿ1980), the Brit Awards (1993ÿ1995), the PDC World Darts Championship (2008ÿpresent) and the Masters snooker tournament (2012ÿpresent).\\r\\nIn November every year, a large fireworks display is scheduled there as part of London's Bonfire Night celebrations.\\r\\nThe Observer's Wildlife Exhibition held here in 1963 was an important early event in highlighting awareness of worldwide endangered species, and it gained a large attendance (46,000).[27]\\r\\nIn April 1967, a benefit event took place there. The 14 Hour Technicolor Dream, organised by the International Times, demonstrated the importance of the quickly developing Underground scene. Although venues such as the UFO Club were hosting counter-cultural bands, this was certainly the largest indoor event at the time. Performers included headlining act Pink Floyd as well as the Pretty Things, Savoy Brown, the Crazy World of Arthur Brown, Soft Machine, the Move and Sam Gopal's Dream (featuring Sam Gopal, Mick Hutchinson and Pete Sears). John Lennon attended, and Yoko Ono (who was soon to become Lennon's new romantic partner) presented her performance work \\"Cut Piece\\".[28]\\r\\nIn 1970, Italian director Lucio Fulci filmed an important segment of his giallo film A Lizard in a Woman's Skin here. Alexandra Palace posed as a disused church.[29] The rock band Led Zeppelin played at Alexandra Palace in December 1972.\\r\\nIn 1973, the Divine Light Mission held a \\"Festival of Love\\" there.[30] Also in 1973, British rock band Wishbone Ash played a Christmas concert at the palace, billed as \\"Christmas at the Palace\\".\\r\\nThe American band Grateful Dead played a series of shows there in September 1974 and a recording of one of the shows was released as part of the Dick's Picks series in March 1997.\\r\\nThe Campaign for Real Ale held the Great British Beer Festival there from 1977 to 1980 (the 1980 edition taking place in tents outside the fire-damaged Alexandra Palace).\\r\\nAfter the fire, the burnt-out shell of the great hall of Alexandra Palace was used as Victory Square in Michael Radford's 1984 film adaptation of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\\r\\nThe Sinclair C5 battery electric vehicle was launched at the palace in January 1985, one week after the closure of the 405-line television system that was inaugurated there 49 years earlier.\\r\\nIn November 1989 the Stone Roses played their first major gig in the South of England at Alexandra Palace, notable particularly as the band sold the venue out before being featured significantly in the music press or making any national television appearances.\\r\\nHugh Cornwell played his last gig with the Stranglers at Alexandra Palace in August 1990.\\r\\nBlur organised a major concert at the venue in October 1994 to promote their album Parklife.

In November 1996 it was the venue for the annual MTV Europe Music Awards.\\r\\nThe fourth Mind Sports Olympiad was held at Alexandra Palace in August 2000, with more than 4,000 competitors from around the world taking part in mind sports.[31]\\r\\nIn June 2007, a Hackday event was hosted at Alexandra Palace by the BBC and Yahoo! During the event, the building was struck by lightning, causing the fire vents to open (and then get stuck open), and it rained inside the building.[32]\\r\\nSince December 2007, Alexandra Palace has hosted the PDC World Darts Championship,[33] following 14 years from December 1993 to January 2007 of the tournament being held at the Circus Tavern in Purfleet, Essex. The palace was previously home to the News of the World Darts Championship between 1963 and 1977.\\r\\nApril 2008 saw the re-launch of the regular antiques fairs,[34] now held four times a year, organised by International Antiques & Collectors Fairs (IACF).\\r\\nThe band Portishead hosted one of two All Tomorrow's Parties festivals titled I'll Be Your Mirror in July 2011 at Alexandra Palace.[35] The 50th anniversary programme of Songs of Praise was recorded there in September 2011 and broadcast the following month.[36]\\r\\nSince 2012 and until 2019, it is the venue for the Masters snooker tournament, held every January.[37]\\r\\nDuring the 2012 Summer Olympics it served as the official hospitality venue for the Dutch Olympic team.[38]\\r\\nIn November 2012, it was the venue for the annual Warped Tour, a music and extreme sports festival.\\r\\nAlexandra Palace continues to be a prolific and high-profile music venue attracting internationally renowned artists. Suede appeared in March 2013, playing one of the first dates in support of Bloodsports, their first new album in more than a decade.

The three colors of the candy ÿ a broad yellow end, a tapered orange center, and a pointed white tip ÿ mimic the appearance of kernels of corn, hence the name.[2] Each piece is approximately three times the size of a real kernel from a ripe or dried ear.\\r\\nCandy corn is made primarily from sugar, corn syrup, confectioner's wax, artificial coloring and binders.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Chicken Feed\\" was the original name of the candy with production starting in the 1880s.[4] Wunderlee Candy Company was the first to produce the candy.[5] Following the 19th century, the Goelitz Confectionary Company (now called Jelly Belly) manufactured the product. Along with other agriculture-inspired treats at the time, the late 19th century, Americas' confectioners sought to market candy corn to a largely rural society.[6]\\r\\nThe National Confectioners Association estimates that 35 million pounds (over 9000 metric tons) of candy corn are sold annually.[7]\\r\\nOriginally the candy was made by hand.[8] Manufacturers first combined sugar, corn syrup, carnauba wax, and water and cooked them to form a slurry. Fondant was added for texture and marshmallows were added to provide a soft bite.[8] The final mixture was then heated and poured into shaped molds. Three passes, one for each colored section, were required during the pouring process.\\r\\nThe recipe remains basically the same today. The production method, called \\"corn starch modeling,\\"[2] likewise remains the same, though tasks initially performed by hand were soon taken over by machines invented for the purpose.[9] As of 2016, annual production in the United States is 35 million pounds, or almost 9 billion pieces of candy[10].\\r\\nA popular variation called \\"Indian corn\\" features a chocolate brown wide end, orange center and pointed white tip, often available around Thanksgiving.[4] During the Halloween season, blackberry cobbler candy corn can be found in eastern Canada.

(1952) by Pierre Boulle. The film is a work of fiction that uses the historical setting of the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942ÿ1943.  The cast included  William Holden, Jack Hawkins, and Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was initially scripted by screenwriter Carl Foreman, who was later replaced by Michael Wilson. Both writers had to work in secret, as they were on the Hollywood blacklist and had fled to England in order to continue working. As a result, Boulle, who did not speak English, was credited and received the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay; many years later, Foreman and Wilson posthumously received the Academy Award.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was widely praised, winning seven Academy Awards (including Best Picture) at the 30th Academy Awards. It used lush colour to bring out the British stiff upper lip of the colonel, played by Alec Guinness in an Oscar-winning performance.[4] In 1997, the film was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress. It has been included on the American Film Institute's list of best American films ever made.[5][6] In 1999, the British Film Institute voted The Bridge on the River Kwai the 11th greatest British film of the 20th Century.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany historical inaccuracies in the film have often been noted by eyewitnesses to the building of the real Burma Railway and historians.[7][8][9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 1943, British POWs arrive by train at a Japanese prison camp in Burma. The commandant, Colonel Saito, informs them that all prisoners, regardless of rank, are to work on the construction of a railway bridge over the River Kwai that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon. The senior British officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson, informs Saito that the Geneva Conventions exempt officers from manual labour. Nicholson later forbids any escape attempts because they had been ordered by headquarters to surrender, and escapes could be seen as defiance of orders.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the morning assembly, Nicholson orders his officers to remain behind when the enlisted men march off to work. Saito threatens to have them shot, but Nicholson refuses to back down. When Major Clipton, the British medical officer, warns Saito there are too many witnesses for him to get away with murder, Saito leaves the officers standing all day in the intense heat. That evening, the officers are placed in a punishment hut, while Nicholson is locked in an iron box.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, three prisoners attempt to escape. Two are shot dead, but United States Navy Commander Shears gets away, although badly wounded. He stumbles into a village of natives, who nurse him back to health and then help him leave by boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the prisoners work as little as possible and sabotage whatever they can. Should Saito fail to meet his deadline, he would be obliged to commit ritual suicide. Desperate, he uses the anniversary of Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War as an excuse to save face and announces a general amnesty, releasing Nicholson and his officers and exempting them from manual labour.\\r\\n\\r\\nNicholson is shocked by the poor job being done by his men. Over the protests of some of his officers, he orders Captain Reeves and Major Hughes to design and build a proper bridge to maintain his men's morale. As the Japanese engineers had chosen a poor site, the original construction is abandoned and a new bridge begun downstream.\\r\\n\\r\\nShears is enjoying his hospital stay in Ceylon when British Major Warden invites him to join a mission to destroy the bridge before it is completed. Shears is so appalled, he confesses he is not an officer; he impersonated one, expecting better treatment from the Japanese.

Realising he has no choice, Shears volunteers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Nicholson drives his men hard to complete the bridge on time. For him, its completion will exemplify the ingenuity and hard work of the British Army long after the war's end. When he asks that their Japanese counterparts pitch in as well, a resigned Saito replies that he has already given the order. Clipton expresses grave doubts about the sanity of Colonel Nicholson's efforts to build the bridge in order to show up his Japanese captors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four commandos parachute in, though one is killed on landing. Later, Warden is wounded in an encounter with a Japanese patrol and has to be carried on a litter. He, Shears, and Canadian Lieutenant Joyce reach the river in time with the assistance of Siamese women bearers and their village chief, Khun Yai. Under cover of darkness, Shears and Joyce plant explosives on the bridge towers below the water line.\\r\\n\\r\\nA train carrying important dignitaries and soldiers is scheduled to be the first to cross the bridge the following day, so Warden waits to destroy both. However, by daybreak the water level has dropped, exposing the wire connecting the explosives to the detonator. Nicholson spots the wire and brings it to Saito's attention. As the train approaches, they hurry down to the riverbank to investigate.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoyce, manning the detonator, breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson yells for help, while attempting to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator. When Joyce is mortally wounded by Japanese fire, Shears swims across the river, but is himself shot. Recognising the dying Shears, Nicholson exclaims, \\"What have I done?\\" Warden fires a mortar, wounding Nicholson. The dying colonel stumbles towards the detonator and collapses on the plunger just in time to blow up the bridge and send the train hurtling into the river below. Warden turns toward the only survivors of the commando raid, the women bearers, and begs their forgiveness for having to kill Joyce and Shears, and throws the mortar launcher away in disgust, and prepares to leave. Clipton, observing the carnage, shakes his head muttering, \\"Madness!, Madness!\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe screenwriters, Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, were on the Hollywood blacklist and, even though living in exile in England, could only work on the film in secret. The two did not collaborate on the script; Wilson took over after Lean was dissatisfied with Foreman's work. The official credit was given to Pierre Boulle (who did not speak English), and the resulting Oscar for Best Screenplay (Adaptation) was awarded to him. Only in 1984 did the Academy rectify the situation by retroactively awarding the Oscar to Foreman and Wilson, posthumously in both cases. Subsequent releases of the film finally gave them proper screen credit. David Lean himself also claimed that producer Sam Spiegel cheated him out of his rightful part in the credits since he had had a major hand in the script.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was relatively faithful to the novel, with two major exceptions. Shears, who is a British commando officer like Warden in the novel, became an American sailor who escapes from the POW camp. Also, in the novel, the bridge is not destroyed: the train plummets into the river from a secondary charge placed by Warden, but Nicholson (never realising \\"what have I done?\\") does not fall onto the plunger, and the bridge suffers only minor damage. Boulle nonetheless enjoyed the film version though he disagreed with its climax.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nLaurence Olivier was offered the part of Colonel Nicholson but turned it down in order to direct The Prince and the Showgirl. He later said that it was a sensible decision to go off and do love scenes with Marilyn Monroe rather than duke it out with Lean in the jungles of Ceylon. Spiegel persuaded Spencer Tracy to play Nicholson, but Tracy, who was American like Spiegel and had read the book, emphatically told him that the part should be played by an Englishman.\\r\\n\\r\\nLean offered Charles Laughton the part of Nicholson, but Laughton later refused, deciding that he could not handle the heat of Ceylon and the somewhat warlike, militant nature of the story.[13] Ronald Colman, Ray Milland, No?l Coward and James Mason were among the actors that were considered to replace Laughton in the role.[14] Alec Guinness, who had worked with Lean on Oliver Twist, eventually got the role.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpiegel approached Cary Grant for the part of Shears. Grant had read the book and was interested in playing Shears, but admitted having hemmed and hawed too much over script changes and the fact that he would have to go to Ceylon to shoot the film. Spiegel also approached Humphrey Bogart, who died before the film's release.[15] Rock Hudson was also considered, but he turned the down role to star in A Farewell to Arms.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nMontgomery Clift was considered for the role of either Shears or Joyce. Spiegel offered him a role in the film at a dinner which went horribly wrong, due to Clift's poor health on account of drug use.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany directors were considered for the project, among them John Ford, William Wyler, Howard Hawks, Fred Zinnemann, and Orson Welles (who was also offered a starring role).[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was an international co-production between companies in Britain and the United States.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nDirector David Lean clashed with his cast members on multiple occasions, particularly Alec Guinness and James Donald, who thought the novel was anti-British. Lean had a lengthy row with Guinness over how to play the role of Nicholson; Guinness wanted to play the part with a sense of humour and sympathy, while Lean thought Nicholson should be \\"a bore.\\" On another occasion, they argued over the scene where Nicholson reflects on his career in the army. Lean filmed the scene from behind Guinness and exploded in anger when Guinness asked him why he was doing this. After Guinness was done with the scene, Lean said, \\"Now you can all fuck off and go home, you English actors. Thank God that I'm starting work tomorrow with an American actor (William Holden).\\"[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was made in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The bridge in the film was near Kitulgala.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuinness later said that he subconsciously based his walk while emerging from \\"the Oven\\" on that of his eleven-year-old son Matthew,[22] who was recovering from polio at the time, a disease that left him temporarily paralyzed from the waist down.[23] Guinness later reflected on the scene, calling it the \\"finest piece of work\\" he had ever done.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nLean nearly drowned when he was swept away by the river current during a break from filming.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe filming of the bridge explosion was to be done on 10 March 1957, in the presence of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, then Prime Minister of Ceylon, and a team of government dignitaries. However, cameraman Freddy Ford was unable to get out of the way of the explosion in time, and Lean had to stop filming. The train crashed into a generator on the other side of the bridge and was wrecked. It was repaired in time to be blown up the next morning, with Bandaranaike and his entourage present.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe producers nearly suffered a catastrophe following the filming of the bridge explosion. To ensure they captured the one-time event, multiple cameras from several angles were used. Ordinarily, the film would have been taken by boat to London, but due to the Suez crisis this was impossible; therefore the film was taken by air freight. When the shipment failed to arrive in London, a worldwide search was undertaken. To the producers' horror, the film containers were found a week later on an airport tarmac in Cairo, sitting in the hot sun. Although it was not exposed to sunlight, the heat-sensitive colour film stock should have been hopelessly ruined; however, when processed the shots were perfect and appeared in the film.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish composer Malcolm Arnold recalled that he had \\"ten days to write around forty-five minutes worth of music\\" - much less time than he was used to. He described the music for The Bridge on the River Kwai as the \\"worst job I ever had in my life\\" from the point of view of time.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nA memorable feature of the film is the tune that is whistled by the POWsthe first strain of the march \\"Colonel Bogey\\"when they enter the camp.[30] Gavin Young[31] recounts meeting Donald Wise, a former prisoner of the Japanese who had worked on the Burma Railway.  Young: \\"Donald, did anyone whistle Colonel Bogey ... as they did in the film?\\" Wise: \\"I never heard it in Thailand. We hadn't much breath left for whistling.  But in Bangkok I was told that David Lean, the film's director, became mad at the extras who played the prisonersusbecause they couldn't march in time.  Lean shouted at them, 'For God's sake, whistle a march to keep time to.' And a bloke called George Siegatz ...  an expert whistlerbegan to whistle Colonel Bogey, and a hit was born.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe march was written in 1914 by Kenneth J. Alford, a pseudonym of British Bandmaster Frederick J. Ricketts. The Colonel Bogey strain was accompanied by a counter-melody using the same chord progressions, then continued with film composer Malcolm Arnold's own composition, \\"The River Kwai March,\\" played by the off-screen orchestra taking over from the whistlers, though Arnold's march was not heard in completion on the soundtrack. Mitch Miller had a hit with a recording of both marches.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many tense, dramatic scenes, only the sounds of nature are used. An example of this is when commandos Warden and Joyce hunt a fleeing Japanese soldier through the jungle, desperate to prevent him from alerting other troops. Arnold won an Academy Award for the film's score.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot and characters of Boulle's novel and the screenplay were almost entirely fictional.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conditions to which POW and civilian labourers were subjected by the Japanese military on the historical Burma Railway were far worse than the film depicted.[33]According to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission:\\r\\nThe notorious Burma-Siam railway, built by Commonwealth, Dutch and American prisoners of war, was a Japanese project driven by the need for improved communications to support the large Japanese army in Burma. During its construction, approximately 13,000 prisoners of war died and were buried along the railway. An estimated 80,000 to 100,000 civilians also died in the course of the project, chiefly forced labour brought from Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, or conscripted in Siam (Thailand) and Burma. Two labour forces, one based in Siam and the other in Burma, worked from opposite ends of the line towards the centre.[34]\\r\\nLieutenant Colonel Philip Toosey of the British Army was the real senior Allied officer at the bridge in question. Toosey was very different from Nicholson and was certainly not a collaborator who felt obliged to work with the Japanese. Toosey in fact did as much as possible to delay the building of the bridge. While Nicholson disapproves of acts of sabotage and other deliberate attempts to delay progress, Toosey encouraged this: termites were collected in large numbers to eat the wooden structures, and the concrete was badly mixed.[8][9] Some consider the film to be an insulting parody of Toosey.[8] On a BBC Timewatch programme, a former prisoner at the camp states that it is unlikely that a man like the fictional Nicholson could have risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and, if he had, due to his collaboration he would have been \\"quietly eliminated\\" by the other prisoners. Julie Summers, in her book The Colonel of Tamarkan, writes that Boulle, who had been a prisoner of war in Thailand, created the fictional Nicholson character as an amalgam of his memories of collaborating French officers.[8] He strongly denied the claim that the book was anti-British, although many involved in the film itself (including Alec Guinness) felt otherwise.[35] Ernest Gordon, a survivor of the railway construction and POW camps described in the novel/film, stated in a 1962 book, Through the Valley of the Kwai: \\"In Pierre Boulle's book The Bridge over the River Kwai and the film which was based on it, the impression was given that British officers not only took part in building the bridge willingly, but finished in record time to demonstrate to the enemy their superior efficiency. This was an entertaining story. But I am writing a factual account, and in justice to these menliving and deadwho worked on that bridge, I must make it clear that we never did so willingly. We worked at bayonet point and under bamboo lash, taking any risk to sabotage the operation whenever the opportunity arose.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1969 BBC-TV documentary, Return to the River Kwai, made by former POW John Coast,[10] sought to highlight the real history behind the film (partly through getting ex-POWs to question its factual basis, for example Dr Hugh de Wardener and Lt-Col Alfred Knights), which angered many former POWs.  The documentary itself was described by one newspaper reviewer when it was shown on Boxing Day 1974 (The Bridge on the River Kwai had been shown on BBC1 on Christmas Day 1974) as \\"Following the movie, this is a rerun of the antidote.\\"[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the characters in the film use the names of real people who were involved in the Burma Railway. Their roles and characters, however, are fictionalised. For example, a Sergeant-Major Risaburo Saito was in real life second in command at the camp. In the film, a Colonel Saito is camp commandant. In reality, Risaburo Saito was respected by his prisoners for being comparatively merciful and fair towards them. Toosey later defended him in his war crimes trial after the war, and the two became friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major railway bridge described in the novel and film didn't actually cross the river known at the time as the Kwai. However, in 1943 a railway bridge was built by Allied POWs over the Mae Klong river ÿ renamed as a result of the film Khwae Yai in the 1960s ÿ at Tha Ma Kham, five kilometres from Kanchanaburi, Thailand.[37] Boulle had never been to the bridge.  He knew that the railway ran parallel to the Kwae for many miles, and he therefore assumed that it was the Kwae which it crossed just north of Kanchanaburi.  This was an incorrect assumption. The destruction of the bridge as depicted in the film is also entirely fictional. In fact, two bridges were built: a temporary wooden bridge and a permanent steel/concrete bridge a few months later. Both bridges were used for two years, until they were destroyed by Allied bombing. The steel bridge was repaired and is still in use today.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nJapanese viewers disliked the film's \\"glorification\\" of a fictitious and indemonstrable \\"superiority of Western civilization\\". In particular, they resented the implication in the film that Japanese military engineers were less capable than their British counterparts. [38] [39]  In fact, Japanese engineers had been surveying the route of the railway since 1937 and were highly organized.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film contains a scene where Colonel Nicholson, while inspecting the bridge construction progress, refers to the Japanese overseeing them as \\"barbarians\\".[40] In the version of the movie releases on DVD in 2000, the reference is overdubbed with a water splash sound.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nVariety reported that this film was the No.?1 moneymaker of 1958, with a US take of $18,000,000.[41] The second highest moneymaker of 1958 was Peyton Place at $12,000,000; in third place was Sayonara at $10,500,000.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was re-released in 1964 and earned an estimated $2.6 million in North American rentals.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film initially received generally positive reviews, with Guinness being widely praised for his performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican actor Will Smith said that the film is his favorite.\\r\\n\\r\\nChannel 4 (UK) held a poll in 2005 to find the 100 Greatest War Movies: The Bridge on the River Kwai came in at #10, behind Black Hawk Down and in front of The Dam Busters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British Film Institute placed The Bridge on the River Kwai as the 11th greatest British film.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 167-minute film was first telecast, uncut, by ABC-TV in color on the evening of 25 September 1966, as a three hours-plus ABC Movie Special. The telecast of the film lasted more than three hours because of the commercial breaks. It was still highly unusual at that time for a television network to show such a long film in one evening; most films of that length were still generally split into two parts and shown over two evenings. But the unusual move paid off for ABCthe telecast drew huge ratings.[43]  On the evenings of 28 and 29 January 1973, ABC broadcast another David Lean colour spectacular, Lawrence of Arabia, but that broadcast was split into two parts over two evenings, due to the film's nearly four-hour length.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was restored in 1992 by Columbia Pictures. The separate dialogue, music and effects were located and remixed with newly recorded \\"atmospheric\\" sound effects.[45] The image was restored by OCS, Freeze Frame, and Pixel Magic with George Hively editing.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 November 2010 Columbia Pictures released a newly restored The Bridge on the River Kwai for the first time on Blu-ray. According to Columbia Pictures, they followed an all-new 4K digital restoration from the original negative with newly restored 5.1 audio.[47] The original negative for the feature was scanned at 4k (roughly four times the resolution in High Definition), and the colour correction and digital restoration were also completed at 4k. The negative itself manifested many of the kinds of issues one would expect from a film of this vintage: torn frames, embedded emulsion dirt, scratches through every reel, colour fading. Unique to this film, in some ways, were other issues related to poorly made optical dissolves, the original camera lens and a malfunctioning camera. These problems resulted in a number of anomalies that were very difficult to correct, like a ghosting effect in many scenes that resembles colour mis-registration, and a tick-like effect with the image jumping or jerking side-to-side. These issues, running throughout the film, were addressed to a lesser extent on various previous DVD releases of the film and might not have been so obvious in standard definition.[48]","input":"How many academy awards did bridge on the river kwai win?"},{"output":"Democrat Dr. Brad J. Cohen","context":"East Brunswick is a township in Middlesex County, New Jersey, United States. The suburban community is part of the New York City metropolitan area and is located on the southern shore of the Raritan River, directly adjacent to the city of New Brunswick.[19] According to the 2010 United States Census, the township's population was 47,512,[8][9][10] reflecting an increase of 756 (+1.6%) from the 46,756 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 3,208 (+7.4%) from the 43,548 counted in the 1990 Census.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nEast Brunswick was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 28, 1860, from portions of both Monroe Township and North Brunswick Township. Portions of the township were taken to form Washington town within the township (February 23, 1870; became independent as South River on February 28, 1898), Helmetta (March 20, 1888), Milltown (January 29, 1889) and Spotswood (April 15, 1908).[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of the 2010 Census, the United States Census Bureau calculated that New Jersey's center of population was located a few hundred feet east of Nenninger Lane, near the New Jersey Turnpike.[22] Based on the results of the 2000 Census, the state's center of population was located on Milltown Road in East Brunswick.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general area of central New Jersey was once occupied by the Lenape Native Americans. According to a 1677 bill of sale now in the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton, New Jersey, Thomas Lawrence, a New York baker, purchased thousands of acres of land from local Native Americans named Querameck, Kesyacs, Isarick, Metapis, Peckawan, and Turantecas. In this document, the area is called Piscopeek, which later become known as Lawrence Brook, after its purchaser. Around the late 17th century, settlers began arriving in the northern part of East Brunswick, and by the mid-19th century, a small village had formed in the southeastern part, known as the Old Bridge section of the town, an area that was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area today known as East Brunswick was incorporated in 1860 from parts of North Brunswick and Monroe townships, including the community of Old Bridge.[21] Originally a farming community, suburban settlement started in the 1930s with improved road access. Large scale housing and road construction, especially after World War II, transformed East Brunswick into a more suburban community. The extension of the New Jersey Turnpike to East Brunswick in 1952 led to a sharp spike in population growth, with the 1950 Census population of 5,699 more than tripling to 19,965 as of the 1960 enumeration.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1970s a citizens group Concerned Citizens of East Brunswick sued the New Jersey Turnpike Authority over a proposed major widening project.  The citizens group effectively won this case gaining concessions in turnpike design, scale and mitigation measures for noise and air quality.  The citizens group presented technical data from their own experts and prevailed in what was one of the earliest technical confrontations regarding urban highway design related to environmental factors in U.S. history.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nEast Brunswick was also the site of the gunfight at Turnpike exit 9 shortly after midnight on May 2, 1973, in which a car being driven by Zayd Malik Shakur (born James F. Costan), with Assata Shakur (formerly JoAnne Chesimard) and Sundiata Acoli (born Clark Squire) as passengers, was stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike State Trooper James Harper, backed up by Trooper Werner Foerster in a second patrol vehicle. After Zayd Shakur was asked to step out of the car to address a discrepancy in his identification, a shootout ensued in which Trooper Foerster was shot twice in the head with his own gun and killed, Zayd Shakur was killed, and both Assata Shakur and Trooper Harper were wounded.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 22.270 square miles (57.679?km2), including 21.699 square miles (56.200?km2) of land and 0.571 square miles (1.479?km2) of water (2.56%).[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe township lies on exit 9 of the New Jersey Turnpike.  Its Municipal Building, named for 1970s Mayor Jean Walling, is located 31 miles (50?km) southwest of New York City's Times Square and 49 miles (79?km) northeast of Center City, Philadelphia.  It takes approximately 45ÿ60 minutes to reach Midtown Manhattan or Center City, Philadelphia, depending on traffic and destination.[28] Route 18 runs through the eastern part of the township.\\r\\n\\r\\nLawrence Brook, a tributary of the Raritan River, runs along the western border of the township.

The mayor and two council seats are up for vote together during Presidential election years, with the other seats up for vote two years later. Serving on a part-time basis as the chief executive of the community, the Mayor votes only in the case of a tie on a vote by the Township Council and can veto ordinances, but vetoes can be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the Council. The Township Council adopts ordinances; adopts a budget after review and revisions; makes appropriations; sets taxes and bond issues; creates and abolishes jobs via ordinance; sets salaries and establishes municipal policy. The Council has the authority to initiate hearings for the purposes of gathering information for ordinance making, airing public problems and supervising the spending of its appropriations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2017[update], the mayor of East Brunswick is Democrat Dr. Brad J.

A lottery is held each year, with separate draws for residents of East Brunswick Township and non-residents, to allocate the limited number of positions available for each class.[107] The school plans to build a permanent structure as part of the Campus for Jewish Life (formerly known as the YM-YWHA of Raritan Valley) to replace its current facility the school has rented located near Trinity Presbyterian Church.[108] Concerns have been raised regarding the funding for the school, which will come from the East Brunswick Board of Education budget, including $1.34 million for the 2010-11 school year, and that the district will not be able to reduce expenses by the amount that will be paid to the charter school. Hatikvah school officials emphasize that charter schools can often educate students at a lower cost than traditional public schools and that \\"taxpayers do not pay an extra penny for having a charter school in town, period\\".[109] The school received $75,000 in grants from foundations to cover the costs of applying for a charter and for getting the school operational.[110] Hatikvah budgeted $11,033 per student for the 2010-11 school year,[111] while the East Brunswick Public Schools budgeted $12,782 per pupil for that same year.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nSolomon Schechter Day School of Raritan Valley, a Conservative Jewish day school, closed its doors before the start of the 2013-14 school year in the wake of sharply lower enrollment and financial difficulties.[113] During the 2009-10 school year, the school was awarded the Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education, the highest award an American school can receive.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Bartholomew's School is a Catholic elementary school serving 349 students in Pre-K through eighth grade as of the 2013-14 school year.[115] The school operates under the supervision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Metuchen.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  May?2010[update], the township had a total of 205.94 miles (331.43?km) of roadways, of which 176.11 miles (283.42?km) were maintained by the municipality, 19.65 miles (31.62?km) by Middlesex County, 5.48 miles (8.82?km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and 4.70 miles (7.56?km) by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoute 18 passes through East Brunswick, and is an important artery connecting New Brunswick, U.S. Route 1, the Jersey Shore, and the New Jersey Turnpike, Interstate 95 (which also passes through the township).

His recorded feats, including lifting 500 pounds (227?kg) with one finger and backlifting 4,337 pounds (1,967?kg), show Cyr to be, according to former International Federation of BodyBuilding & Fitness chairman Ben Weider, the strongest man ever to have lived.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCyr was born in Saint-Cyprien-de-Napierville, Quebec, Canada. Coming from a robust French-Canadian family, he began developing extraordinary strength at an early age. While Louis' father was of average proportions, his mother was almost Amazonian, recorded as weighing 265?lb at 6' 1\\". She in turn had a father of 6' 4\\" and 260?lb. From the age of 12 Cyr worked in a lumber camp during the winters and on the familys farm the rest of the year. Discovering his exceptional strength at a very young age, he impressed his fellow workers with his feats of strength. After learning of the tale, Cyr attempted to mimic the practice of legendary strongman Milo of Croton, who as a child carried a calf on his shoulders, continuing to carry it as it grew into a full-grown bull and he into a grown man. Cyr's calf, however, bolted one day, kicking him in his back, after which he instead began carrying a sack of grain 1?4 mile (0.40?km) every day, adding 2 pounds (0.91?kg) each day. According to one of his biographers, his mother decided he should let his hair grow, like Samson in the Bible. She curled it regularly.[1]\\r\\nLouis started his strong man career at the age of 17, after some publicity came about due to an incident when the young Louis was reported to have lifted a farmer's heavily laden wagon out of the mire in which it had become stuck. He was matched in a contest against Michaud of Quebec, who was recognized as Canada's strongest man of the time. Cyr beat him in tests of lifting of heavy stones by hoisting a granite boulder weighing 480?lb (220?kg).\\r\\nIn 1878 the Cyr family immigrated to Lowell, Massachusetts in the United States. In Lowell Cyr changed his name from Cyprien-No to Louis, as it was easier to pronounce in English. Again his great strength brought him fame. At 17 years old he weighed 230 pounds (104?kg). He entered his first strongman contest in Boston at age 18, lifting a horse off the ground; the fully grown male horse was placed on a platform with 2 iron bars attached enabling Cyr to obtain a better grip. The horse weighed at least 3?4 short ton (0.68?t).[1]\\r\\nIn 1884 Louis married Melina (ne Courtois) while Louis worked as a logger. The following year he and his wife returned to Lowell, hoping to capitalize on his fame there. A tour of the Maritimes was organized, and while it may have benefited the organizer, Cyr gained no profit financially. He then began touring Quebec with his family in a show they called \\"The Troupe Cyr\\".\\r\\nSoon proving his immense strength, he was urged by friends to enter the exciting, albeit highly precarious world of professional strong men, lifting mainly crude solid or shot filled weights.\\r\\nFrom 1883 to 1885, Cyr served as a police officer in Montreal, Quebec. Following this he went on tour with a troupe that included a wrestler, a boxer, and a weightlifter. He entered a strongman competition in March 1886, at Quebec City, against the reigning Canadian strongman, David Michaud. Cyr lifted a 218-pound (99?kg) barbell with one hand (to Michauds 158 pounds or 72?kg) and a weight of 2,371 pounds (1,075?kg) on his back, to his opponents 2,071 pounds (939?kg) to win the title of strongest man in the country.[1]\\r\\nWith little reward at this early foray into professional weightlifting, Louis was forced to seek other employment, fate taking a hand in his decision when he apparently stepped into, and broke up, by sheer physical force, a dangerous knife fight. Accounts of the day recall how Cyr disarmed and subdued the combatants and then made a citizens arrest, carrying both miscreants, one under each arm, to the local police station. With this superb reference, Louis joined the police, becoming for several years a genuine police officer.\\r\\nPrudent with his earnings, Louis left the Police Force and purchased a tavern/restaurant in St. Cungonde, where he also featured a gymnasium which like many such places in its day became a Mecca for strength athletes and fighters. Cyr was well acquainted with the famous John L. Sullivan, being one of the few to defy Sullivan's commands to drink when he drank. Sullivan was known as The Boston Strong Boy and was very powerful, but not in Cyr's class. Cyr, happy in his own environment, beat all comers when challenged to perform.\\r\\nLouis Cyr's exploits had been well publicized in the 'Pink Un' (the paper was actually pink, although the contents were often 'blue') or Police Gazette published by Richard K. Fox, the famed proprietor and promoter of other strength athletes, e.g. Travis, Sandow etc. Fox offered a side bet of $5,000 to anyone who could beat Cyr at any of his strength feats. Promoted by Fox, Louis went on tour circa 1885ÿ1891 beating, amongst others: Sebastian Miller, Bienkowski, or Cyclops (who could genuinely bend coins), August Johnson, and Richard Pennell, plus continually challenging, without success, Eugen Sandow, with a genuinely diamond studded belt to be awarded to the winner, should such an event ever take place. It never did. Sandow was an astute showman, but no fool, and avoided any such challenges throughout his esteemed career after early mistakes, like the time he was beaten by McCann.\\r\\nThere was no doubt that Cyr was an unusual man regarding size and measurements, the latter often causing debate. Although Dr. Dudley A. Sargent, famous Harvard University physical director recorded measuring Louis Cyr in 1895 when Cyr was 32 years old and weighed 291?lb (132?kg). Sargent listed Cyr's height as 5'8.5\\". Other measurements, most on the conservative side as compared to other biographers, were neck - 20 inches (51?cm), biceps - 20 inches (51?cm), forearms - 16.3 inches (41?cm), wrists - 8.2 inches (21?cm), chest (normal) - 55.2 inches (140?cm), chest expanded - 60 inches (150?cm), waist - 47.4 inches (120?cm), hips - 48.1 inches (122?cm), thighs - 28.5 inches (72?cm), knees - 17\\", and calves - 19.3 inches (49?cm), far short of the quoted 28\\", but perhaps a possible 23\\" later when of higher body weight. Ankle 10.3 inches (26?cm) and Shoulder width with calipers .... across the deltoids 25.6 inches (65?cm). The above details were just one set of figures relating to Cyr's size, others being recorded by Willoughby when for example Cyr was 47 years old (in 1910) gave him calf 23\\", neck 22 3/4\\", biceps 21 1/2\\". chest normal 59 1/2\\" and thighs 33\\" with other parts to match the increase in weight, being at the time a heavier 365?lbs. Ben Weider, who was privileged to access family archives, was even more generous giving arm size 24 inches (61?cm), forearms 19 inches (48?cm), and calves, the disputed 28 inches (71?cm), following a similar line to Jowett.\\r\\nWhile several of Cyr's feats of strength may have been exaggerated over the years, some were documented and remain impressive. These included:\\r\\nPerhaps his greatest feat occurred in 1895, when he was reported to have lifted 4,337 pounds (1,967?kg) on his back in Boston by putting 18 men on a platform and lifting them.[4] One of his most memorable displays of strength occurred in Montreal on 12 October 1891. Louis resisted the pull of four draught horses (two in each hand) as grooms stood cracking their whips to get the horses to pull harder, a feat he again demonstrated in Ottawa with Queen Victoria's team of draught horses during her 'Royal' visit.[citation needed] While in Ottawa he volunteered with the police when they took deputees to round up a local gang of miscreants; they turned him away claiming he would be too slow due to his bulk. He challenged the regular officers to a foot race, beating the majority, and they took him on.[1]\\r\\nHe patrolled as a police officer between 1883ÿ1885 in Sainte-Cungonde, known now as Petite-Bourgogne (Little Burgundy) in Montreal. Both the Parc Louis-Cyr and the Place des Hommes-Forts (\\"Strongmen's Square\\") are named after him. Statues of him are located at Place des Hommes-Forts and the Muse de la Civilisation in Quebec City. The highschool in his hometown of Napierville is also named after him.\\r\\nThrough no fault of his own, many of Cyr's lifts, like his measurements, have been exaggerated or misquoted. In particular, his celebrated back lift done in Boston, of 18 men on a platform, is usually generously estimated at 4,300?lb, which allowing for a very heavy platform of at most 500?lb, meant that each man on average would have weighed approximately 211?lb.\\r\\nCyr was also credited with side pressing 273.75?lb (124.17?kg) with one arm (the right), a lift witnessed by Britain's great champion Tom Pevier, who described it more like a 'Jerk Press.' The dumbbell, a huge thick handled one, was lifted to the shoulders with two hands, before the single-handed overhead move. Cyr's dumbbells were often so unwieldy that many respectable strongmen[who?] were unable to lift them off the floor, let alone lift them over head.\\r\\nOne particular dumbbell of Cyr's weighed, when empty, 202?lb (92?kg). it being the same bell that had defeated a drove of former strength athletes, was exchanged by its owner, 280?lb. police chief Joseph Moquin of Quebec (who could and did bent press the weight) for a modern set of York weights, thus it came into the possession of the late Bob Hoffman and Mike Dietz. According to Strength & Health magazine, Hoffman, after several attempts, was able to bent press it, as did the much lighter 150?lb. Sig Klein, John Grimek later also bent pressed it, half a dozen times or so one afternoon, when the weight was increased to 269.5?lb, by adding, as it happened, the lead type from Mark Berrys' classic tome Physical Training Simplified. Hence the reason the book was never reprinted.\\r\\nCyr was a big man in all ways, both heart and size, being a great trencherman, eating more than four normal men. Up to 6?lb of meat at one meal...a genuine gourmand, increasing weight enormously in his later years. His lightest bodyweight was when he competed against August Johnson, then just 270?lb, although his normal contest condition was nearer 320?lb. Cyr's wife, Melina, by contrast, never weighed more than 100?lb.\\r\\nIn 1886 Cyr met and defeated Richard Pennell, then Pennell being 40, and Louis just 23. In 1888 on 1 October at Berthierville, Quebec, he lifted 3,536?lb/1, 604?kg of pig iron for his first record in the back lift.\\r\\nOn 1 December 1891 at Sohmer Park in Montreal, before some 10,000 people Cyr resisted the pull of four draught horses, two each side, pulling away at his clenched hands, regardless of grooms cracking their whips to encourage the horses to pull harder and strain their haunches.\\r\\nIn January 1892 Cyr embarked in England with partner Horace Barre, resulting in arousing much interest and curiosity at his London debut at the Royal Aquarium, with 5,000 people packing the theater to watch Cyr's act and witness his open challenge to the wide world of strongmen, many celebrities of which were in the audience, with a side wager of S1,000 (Equivalent to about S98,070.00 as of 2015). It was on this historical occasion, on 19 January 1892 that Cyr pressed the pre-mentioned 273.75?lb. dumbbell. Many years later Doc Aumont, son-in-law of Louis, loaned Cyr's famous dumbbell to the Weider's Your Physique office in Montreal for a month, during which time over 500 people tried and failed to lift the weight.\\r\\nDuring his first London show, many other feats followed, all exceeding contemporary records, culminating in the famous Backlift. Placing a number of men upon a heavy platform resting across two trestles, Louis ducked beneath the platform, placed his back below the center, and raised both the contraption and the passengers clear off the trestles. Weight on this occasion was estimated at 3,635?lb. Traveling extensively throughout the UK he also visited Scotland, raising and carrying for a distance one of the famed Dinnie stones. Cyr was very popular in Britain, being feted by celebrities and Royalty alike, including the Prince of Wales and Queen Victoria.\\r\\nAfter returning to the U.S.A. on 27 May, Cyr did his best back lift in Boston, with over 4,000?lb estimated. Consisting of 18 'bulky' men.\\r\\nDuring his most active period, circa 1896, on March 31 he did a clean and jerk (the clean is a misnomer) of 347?lb, then a World record, without science or skill, little if any dipping.\\r\\nReputable witness Oscar Mathes said the lift was closer to a straight-legged press. Cyr did a one-handed deadlift with a dumbbell weighing 525?lb (238?kg), made harder by the fact that the bar was 1.5 inches thick. On 7 and 8 May 1896, he performed a crucifix with 97.25?lb (44.11?kg) in his right hand, and 88?lb (40?kg) in his left. Some authors often credit him with holding out with one arm.- 131.25?lb (59.53?kg). He also dumbbell pressed 162?lb for 36 reps, did a one finger lift, first with 552?lb and the next day made it 553?lb (251?kg). Lifted via one hand, style not specified, but most suspect[who?] using hand and thigh method, 987?lb (448?kg). plus again, using hand and thigh, 1,897.25?lb (860.58?kg).\\r\\nFor years Louis pictured himself as a modern Biblical Samson with tresses to match. In the folds of his long hair he would tie three fifty pound weights, one on each side, and one in the center, with the three weights dangling from his scalp, he would also spin around, swirling the weights around his head. By co-incidence on his visit to Britain, the top of the pops was a ditty entitled 'Get Your Hair Cut'...Louis must have taken the hint, as afterwards he always sported short hair.\\r\\nMore power of the arm and shoulder was demonstrated by his stunt of stacking four fifty pound weights one on top of the other on his half flexed arm, balancing them whilst walking across the room.\\r\\nCyr learned boxing and wrestling for a match. While in Montral, Que., 25 March 1901, Louis Cyr wrestled douard Beaupr, who was known as a giant man. Cyr's height was measured at 5?feet 8.5?inches (1.740 metres) and he weighed 365 pounds (166 kilograms). Beaupr's height was measured at 7?feet 8.1?inches (2.339 metres) and he weighed 365 pounds (166 kilograms). Cyr won.\\r\\nBy 1904 Cyr's health began to fail due to excessive eating and inactivity. At the time, he weighed 400 pounds (180?kg). He slimmed down as best he could for his last contest of strength, with Hector De Carrie. Cyr retained his title and retired unvanquished.\\r\\nCyr died on November 10, 1912, in Montreal, of chronic nephritis and was interred at St-Jean-De-Matha. Great homage was paid by all of Canada, with immense crowds attending the funeral and floral tributes coming from all over the world.\\r\\nHe was portrayed by Antoine Bertrand in the 2013 biographical film Louis Cyr, l'homme le plus fort du monde.\\r\\nAs shown in movie Louis Cyr","input":"Who is the strongest man that ever lived?"},{"output":"Bronson","context":"Hemkosh (Assamese: ??????, IPA:?[h?mk?x]) is the first etymological dictionary of the Assamese language based on Sanskrit spellings, compiled by Hemchandra Barua.

Bronsons work did not pretend to be an etymological dictionary but contained a very considerable collection of words from the people themselves without recording derivations.[1]","input":"Who compiled and published the first assames dictionary?"},{"output":"July 5, 2000","context":"Big Brother 1 was the debut season of the American reality television series Big Brother. It was based upon the Netherlands series of the same name, which gained notoriety in 1999 and 2000. The series premiered on July 5, 2000 and lasted for a total of 88 days. The season concluded after 88 days with Eddie McGee being crowned the winner, and Josh Souza the runner-up. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe premise of the series drastically differed from future installments of the series. The series revolved around ten strangers living in a house together with no communication with the outside world. They were constantly filmed during their time in the house, and were not permitted to communicate with those filming them. Every other week, each contestant, referred to as \\"Houseguests\\", chose two people to be up for nomination. The two or more people with the most votes were nominated to leave the house. The viewers then decide which of the nominees should leave (which followed the format used in other countries, unlike today, with the houseguests deciding themselves), with the selected person leaving during a live show. This process continued until only three HouseGuests remained, at which time the viewers would decide which of them would win the $500,000 grand prize.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series first launched in Netherlands, with editions in countries such as Germany proving to be hits with the public.[1][2] Following the international success of the series, a bidding war for the rights to series engaged between CBS, ABC, and a cable network,[3] with the series initially set to last 100 days.[4] Mark Itkin, the senior vice president of William Morris, was quoted as saying, \\"I had no idea the bidding would be so hot. But the show has so many elements, from being on 100 days in a row to an Internet component that is especially attractive to networks.\\"[5] Ultimately, it was confirmed that the show had been picked up by CBS for an estimated $20 million.[6][7] It was later reported that production costs added to an estimated $200,000 per episode.[8] Paul Romer, co-creator of the original series, served as the Executive Producer for the series.[9] On the concept, Romer stated \\"The show is all about human interactions. It's people who are, loving each other, hating each other. They fight, they cry, they laugh -- all emotions, we'll see in the house.\\"[10] In a later interview, Romer added \\"The first thing people think of when they hear the Big Brother idea are the sexual things, the nudity, the sexual activity in the house [...] That's not what the show is about.\\"[11] The series was one of the first reality shows to air, and required a crew of over 150 people.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first season of Big Brother featured two hosts, Julie Chen as the main host and Ian O'Malley as a co-host.[13] On earning the job, O'Malley stated \\"I didnt really know what it was. This is the ground floor of reality television. [But] SAG went on strike [and it was] a very lengthy and very painful strike for many folks.\\"[14] O'Malley was later released from his contract after only one month on the series;[15] he was bought out of his contract, which he later cited as a \\"relief\\".[16] Chen, who hoped to be a part of 60 Minutes in the future, initially turned down the offer to host the series as she did not want to be in the entertainment division of the network.[17] Upon declining the offer, CBS News president Andrew Heyward told Chen that refusal to do the series could be seen as \\"insubordination\\".[18] Chen clarified \\"They said they needed someone who knows how to ask questions on live TV and I asked Am I forever sealing the door on 60 Minutes? and [Heyward] said yes,.[19][20] Dr. Drew Pinsky and AOL Online Advisor Regina Lewis appeared once per week on the series to discuss the events in the house.[21] The cast for the series was revealed during the premiere. HouseGuest William was revealed to be a member of the Black Panther Party,[22] while Jamie was crowned Miss Washington USA the year prior to her participation on the show.[23] HouseGuests Curtis and Josh had done modeling prior to entering the house.[24] Jean Jordan had been an exotic dancer before entering the house,[25] while Karen and George were married and had children.[26] Cassandra and William were both African-American.[27] Series creator John de Mol later stated \\"The 10 people in our house, you can relate to them. It's the girl next door, it's the guy in the grocery store [...] It's ordinary people, and I think that Big Brother proves ordinary people can be interesting.\\"[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first season of Big Brother premiered on July 5, 2000.[29] The premiere was filmed on July 4, 2000.[30] The series initially aired five nights per week,[31] though a sixth episode was later added into the schedule.[32][33] The addition of a sixth episode per week caused the live banishment episode to move to Wednesday instead of Thursday.[34] Four of these episodes were half-hour daily recap episodes, while one episode was an hourly-long weekly recap; the sixth episode was the live banishment.[35] During the live banishment, the HouseGuest who exits the house was subject to an interview with host Julie Chen.[36] The first season had a total of 70 episodes, the most for any season to date.[37] This season lasted for a total of 88 days.[38] The theme song for the series, known as \\"Live\\", was performed by Jonathan Clarke. It was played during the closing credits of each episode, and segments of the theme were played throughout the show. Viewers of the series could also watch the live feeds in the house, which were available for free on the official website.[35] The feed was edited for music copyrights and to protect the privacy of some contestants.[39][40] The feeds also featured a disclaimer for users under the age of 21, due to unedited aspect to the feeds.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house used for the first season was a one story house with two bedrooms, a kitchen and dining room, and one bathroom.[42] The house was an estimated 1,800 square feet, and was located at the CBS Studio Center in Hollywood, California.[43] Throughout the house, there are a total of 28 cameras making all areas of the house visible to the cameras, and 60 microphones.[44][45] During their stay in the house, the HouseGuests were required to wear microphones at all times, ensuring everything they said in the house was heard.[44] Throughout the house the walls are lined with two way mirrors, with a production team filming behind them.[46] The bedrooms featured infrared imaging cameras, allowing the cameras to continue filming while the rooms were dark. The design of the house included bad feng shui, clashing colors and positioning.[47] The house featured bright colors as part of its theme, with the kitchen being a bright blue and the living room yellow.[30] The two bedrooms in the house were identical, with both featuring a bunk bed and three single beds. The bathroom featured one toilet, one shower, a washboard and a washtub.[47] The Red Room was where HouseGuests were required to share their thoughts on the events in the house, and were often given tasks.[48][49] The backyard of the house featured a patio area where the HouseGuests could sit outside. The backyard also featured a chicken coop, and the HouseGuests were able to use the eggs from the chickens as food.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nBig Brother is a game show in which a group of contestants, referred to as HouseGuests, lived in a custom built \\"house\\", constantly under video surveillance.[51] While in the house, the contestants were completely isolated from the outside world, meaning no phone, television, internet, magazines, newspaper, or contact with those not in the house.[52] This rule could be broken, however, in the event of a family emergency or passing.[53] During their time in the house, the HouseGuests were required to nominate two of their fellow contestants for potential banishment, and the two with the most votes would be nominated.[54] Should multiple HouseGuests receive the most nominations, then all of the HouseGuests were marked for banishment.[21] This process was mandatory for all HouseGuests, and failure to comply could result in expulsion from the house.[55] The public, through a vote conducted by phone, would vote to banish one of the nominated HouseGuests from the house, and the HouseGuest with the most votes from the viewers would be banished from the house.[56] When only three HouseGuests remained, the viewers would vote for which of them should win the series, and the HouseGuest with the most votes would become the winner. The HouseGuests were competing for a $500,000 cash prize,[30][57] though the Runner-Up of the series would receive $100,000 and the second Runner-Up would receive $50,000.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring their time in the house, HouseGuests were given weekly tasks to perform.[3] The HouseGuests would wager a portion of their weekly shopping budget on the task, and would either win double their wagered fund or lose the wagered fund depending on their performance in the task.[21] The HouseGuests were required to work as a group to complete the task, with the format of the tasks varying based on the amount of remaining HouseGuests. Should the HouseGuests run out of the food provided for them, an emergency ration was available to them. HouseGuests were also required to make visits to the Red Room during their stay in the house, where they were able to share their thoughts and feelings on their fellow HouseGuests and the game.[58] The format of the series was mainly seen as a social experiment, and required HouseGuests to interact with others who may have differing ideals, beliefs, and prejudices.[59][60] While a competition, the series allows viewers to witness the relationships formed in the house and the behavior of the HouseGuests.[61] Nina Tassler, president of entertainment at CBS, stated \\"You're talking about people from very disparate walks of life and confining them in a house for a finite period of time [...] you have to recognize yes, this is that show. It is a social experiment.\\"[62] Though locked in the house, the HouseGuests were free to quit the game, though would not be allowed entry back into the house.[63] Should a HouseGuest break the rules of the game, they could be expelled from the house, and unable to return.[64][65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first season of Big Brother featured ten HouseGuests, each of which were complete strangers. All of the HouseGuests were from different states except for Eddie and Curtis, both of whom were from New York. Eddie was the youngest HouseGuests, at 21, while Karen was the oldest, at 43. The viewers were introduced to Beth, a potential eleventh HouseGuest, though she ultimately did not enter. Big Brother 1 is the only season to feature ten HouseGuests, with subsequent seasons featuring twelve or more.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Boswell returned for Big Brother: All-Stars, he finished in 5th. He also returned for Big Brother 10 to host a food competition along with other Big Brother alumnus. George is the only HouseGuest from Big Brother 1 to appear on a future season of the show.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Day 1, Brittany, Cassandra, Curtis, Eddie, Karen, George, Jamie, Jordan, Josh, and William entered the house.[66][67] On Day 2, they were given their first task to complete. They were required to solve a word puzzle, which would inform them of the location to find money for groceries. They were successful and earned $100 as a group.[66] On Day 3, HouseGuests were given the task of building a clock out of potatoes in the house.[68] Should they fail this task, they would not know the time in the house; they passed the task.[69] On Day 4, HouseGuests were given the task of making plaster masks of themselves.[66] On Day 5, one of the chickens in the backyard was injured. It was removed from the house and brought back later to be nursed back to health.[70] On Day 7, HouseGuests were given their first weekly task. They were given the names of dozens of celebrities and had to state whether they were dead or alive.[66] They were given days to attempt to recall the correct answers and would be quizzed about it at a later date. They wagered 20% of their weekly budget on this task, which they ultimately failed.[21] William intentionally failed his portion of the challenge, upsetting many HouseGuests.[71] On Day 9, the HouseGuests participated in their first round of nominations. William and Jordan were announced as the nominees this week, with William receiving six nominations and Jordan receiving five.[72] Josh, Jamie, George, and Cassandra all received no nominations this week.[21] HouseGuests were later given their new task, which required them to ride a stationary exercise bike to achieve a total distance of 1,000 miles.[66] They wagered 50% of their weekly budget on this task, which they passed.[21] HouseGuests were later given another task, in which they were required to imitate another HouseGuest in the Red Room.[21] On Day 16, William became the first HouseGuest to be banished from the house when he received 73% of the public vote.[73][74]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Day 20, HouseGuests are given their new weekly challenge, in which they had days to practice making a set of dominoes fall down in a single session. They had to set up 12,100 dominoes to form the series logo and then make them all fall by knocking only one domino over.[66] The group passed this task, which they wagered 20% on.[21] The HouseGuests later held a fake trial dealing with the issue of flag burning, with Karen as the judge, Jordan being on trial, Brittany being a witness, Curtis and Cassandra as lawyers, and the other HouseGuests as members of the jury.[66] On Day 22, HouseGuests participated in the second round of nominations. Curtis and Jordan became the second set of nominated HouseGuests this season, with Curtis receiving six nominations and Jordan receiving five nominations.[75] Josh, Jamie, Cassandra, and Brittany received no nominations this week, making it the second time in a row that Josh, Jamie, and Cassandra had received no nominations from their fellow HouseGuests. HouseGuests were later given their new weekly task, which required them to ride a stationary bike for a total of one thousand miles. They wagered 50% of their shopping budget on the task, which they passed.[21] The HouseGuests were later given another task, which required them to split into three teams and attempt to toss water balloons to their teammates from across the pool.[21] The team of Eddie, Cassandra, and George won, though there was no reward. On Day 28, the HouseGuests held a roast for Curtis and Jordan as they were marked for banishment. On Day 29, Jordan became the second HouseGuest to be banished from the house when she received 78% of the public vote.[76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouseGuests were given their new weekly task, which required them to write a poem pertaining to the game. They would then have to jump rope together while the rope holders recited the poem. They had one chance to correctly complete the poem, and failure to do so would result in the group failing the task. They wagered 30% of their shopping budget on the task, which they failed.[66] HouseGuests were later given the task of hosting their own daytime talk show.[21] On Day 36, HouseGuests participated in a live challenge in which they had to vote for one HouseGuest to receive a phone call from home; they voted for George.[21] That night, it was revealed that Cassandra, Josh, and Karen had been marked for banishment due to a tie in the voting process.[78] George was the only HouseGuest to receive no nominations this week. That same night, the HouseGuests were given their new weekly task, which required them to take care of a pug named Chiquita.[79] In the days following her nomination, Karen began to ask the viewers to banish her from the house as she missed her children.[80] HouseGuests were later given their new weekly task, in which they were required to make eight raspberry and eight blueberry pies, and split into teams named after the various pies. The first team to eat all eight of their pies would choose how the weekly allowance was spent.[21] On Day 43, HouseGuests participated in a live challenge in which they were tempted with a reward in exchange for watching the nominations process. They ultimately chose not to watch the nominations, thus were not given a prize.[21] That night, Karen became the third HouseGuest to be banished from the house as she had received 76% of the public vote.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouseGuests were given their new weekly task, which required them to memorize all of the major highways in the country. They would then be required to state what highways would get them from one city to another. The group wagered 20% of their shopping budget on this task, which they passed.[21] The group was later given a new task in which they were required to paint each other like animals.[21] In another task for the week, HouseGuests competed in a sumo wrestling competition in an attempt to win a luxury massage. Eddie was the winner, with former HouseGuest William secretly giving him a bad massage.[81] For their next weekly task, the HouseGuests were required to have two HouseGuests dancing at all times. When cued, all HouseGuests would be required to dance at the same time. They passed this task, which they wagered 20% of their weekly budget on.[21] On Day 50, the HouseGuests participated in their fourth round of nominations. Due to a tie in the voting, Brittany, Cassandra, Curtis, Eddie, George, and Josh were all marked for banishment.[82] For the first time, all of the HouseGuests received at least one nomination from their fellow HouseGuests. That same night, Jamie won a two-minute conversation with a casting director due to winning a task earlier in the week.[21] HouseGuests were later given a task in which they had to name a \\"Mr. and Miss Big Brother 2000\\", with Eddie, Brittany, and Cassandra being given the title; they won a dinner with the meal of their choice.[21] On Day 57, Jamie was given a live task in which she was able to co-host the episode with Julie Chen, including announce who had been banished from the house.[21] That night, it was revealed that Brittany had become the fourth HouseGuest to be banished from the house when she received 34% of the public vote.[83][84]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouseGuests were given their new weekly task, which required them to build a puzzle that featured 4,928 pieces by the end of the week. The group wagered 50% of their weekly shopping budget on this task, which they failed.[21] The HouseGuests were later given the task of discussing whether or not they would be willing to split the total prize money.[21] On Day 64, it was revealed that Cassandra, Curtis, and Eddie had been marked for banishment.[85] Much like the previous round of nominations, all of the HouseGuests received at least one nomination from their fellow HouseGuests. Following this, the six remaining HouseGuests were offered $20,000 to walk from the game, with this offer later rising to $50,000.[86] Should one of the HouseGuests accept the offer, a new HouseGuest named Beth was set to enter the house and the nominations would be voided.[87][88] Ultimately, none of the HouseGuests took the offer, thus Beth did not enter the game.[89] That same night, Brittany was able to talk to Josh as part of a task.[90] HouseGuests were later given a new task in which they had to estimate the price of a luxury item requested by another HouseGuest. If they came within one dollar of the correct price, they would earn that luxury.[21] For their new weekly task, the HouseGuests had to train Chiquita to go through an obstacle course. The group passed this task, which they wagered 20% of their weekly budget on.[21] During a luxury competition, Curtis won the reward of going to the 52nd Primetime Emmy Awards.[91] On Day 71, HouseGuests were given the live task of writing a message to be flown on a banner plane above the house.[21] That same night, Cassandra became the fifth HouseGuest to be banished from the house as she had received 46% of the public vote.[92][93]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouseGuests were given their new weekly task, which required at least one HouseGuest to be juggling at all times. They were not permitted to drop more than two balls, or they would fail the task. The group wagered 50% on the task, which they ultimately failed.[21] On Day 74, the HouseGuests were given another live task in which they had five minutes to make a phone call to a loved one. The timer did not stop while the HouseGuests were dialing.[21] That same night, the group made their nominations live for the first time. It was revealed that Curtis, Eddie, George, and Jamie were marked for banishment.[94] Josh received no nominations this week, and was the only HouseGuest not to be marked for banishment.[21] HouseGuests were later given a new task in which they had to write lyrics for the show's theme song, and were later required to record their song in the Red Room.[21] In another task for the week, the HouseGuests attempted to find Chiquita in the house, with the winner being able to present the weather from inside the house; Josh was the winner.[21] On Day 78, the five remaining HouseGuests were asked to select one of the previously banished HouseGuests to return to the house in a matter of days; they chose Cassandra.[21] That night, George became the sixth HouseGuest to be banished from the house as he had received 51% of the public vote.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouseGuests were given their new weekly task, in which they were required to determine whether or not specific news articles had actually appeared in the news or not. The group wagered 50% of their weekly shopping budget on the task, which they passed.[21] The group was later given another task in which they played the Big Brother board game.[21] On Day 81, the HouseGuests participated in their second round of live nominations. Due to a tie in the voting, all four of the remaining HouseGuests were marked for banishment.[96] This was the final round of nominations for the season. Former HouseGuest Cassandra entered the house as a guest that same night, as the HouseGuests had selected her to return days prior.[21] Due to a new task, Josh was selected to become a saboteur in the house, and performed tasks such as setting time back on the potato clock. If one of the other three HouseGuests correctly guessed that Josh was the saboteur, they would win a new flat screen television; Curtis won this prize.[21] On Day 85, Jamie became the seventh HouseGuest to be banished from the house as she had received 31% of the public vote.[97] Chiquita also exited the house that night, and was adopted by a couple upon her exit.[98] On Day 88, it was revealed that Curtis had come in third place, receiving 14% of the public vote to win.[99] Minutes later, it was revealed that Josh had come in second place with 27% of the public vote, meaning Eddie had been crowned the winner with a total of 59% of the public vote.[100][101][102]\\r\\n\\r\\nBig Brother 1 premiered on July 5, 2000 in the US, with the season premiere having over 22 million viewers.[103] Despite the high premiere, ratings for the series quickly began to decline, and the series quickly dropped out of the Top 10 slot in terms of viewers.[103][104] Ratings began to decline even more following the banishments of Will \\"Mega\\" and Jordan, who were both seen as colorful characters in the game.[66] Big Brother 1 was noted as having its highest ratings on Wednesdays, when it aired after the hugely successful Survivor: Borneo.[105] The Saturday, July 8 episode was beaten out by an episode of the reality series Cops.[103] This episode saw ratings lower from the previous episode.[106] Ratings continued to drop, with at one point the series had fallen behind re-runs of shows such as Friends.[107] The Monday, September 4 episode only achieved 5.5.[108] Cassandra's banishment episode did see an increase in ratings, however, receiving 12.5 million viewers.[109] The finale garnered 11.13 million viewers, beating out the Olympics.[110] Despite the decline in ratings, the series' official website did receive a large amount of traffic, due to the live feed being available there.[111] It was also noted that as the ratings decreased, traffic onto the main site increased.[111] The online aspect of the series \\"changed both the dynamic in the house and the TV shows content\\" according to the LA Daily News.[112] It was also reported that the official website for the series was one of the most popular new websites for the month of July.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nBig Brother 1 has typically been cited as \\"boring\\" by critics and fans of the series. John Carman of The San Francisco Chronicle stated \\"Wondering 'Will Karen run out of Kleenex?' is about the most interesting thing about Big Brother.\\"[114] Comedian Kathy Griffin (who has since become a fan of the series, making guest appearances in Big Brother 16 and Big Brother 17) mocked the series, stating \\"Do you guys [watch] those 'tards on Big Brother?\\"[115] Joyce Millman of Salon.com felt that ratings for the series dropped due to the \\"boring\\" cast.[116] The New York Times later reported that CBS was disappointed with the series.[117] Les Moonves, CBS chief, stated that the \\"casting sucked\\" for the series, leading to its disappointing run.[118] He later stated \\"there were more provocative storylines that could have been followed that were dropped.\\"[118] John de Mol, the creator of the series and owner of Endemol, blamed not only the casting but the changes made to the show and format to suit American audiences.[119] Executive producer Paul Romer felt that the group of HouseGuests were \\"too aware of the cameras\\" and were concerned with \\"how they'd look on TV.\\"[120] Former co-host Ian O'Malley claimed he predicted the series would be panned, stating \\"I knew the critics were probably going to go bananas because of the voyeuristic aspect.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon its announcement, the series has come under fire for both controversy and criticism. After the premiere of the first season, Chicago attorney Marvin Rosenblum filed a lawsuit against CBS, then corporate parent Viacom, and the production company Orwell Productions for alleged copyright infringement. Rosenblum, a producer of the film 1984, owns the film and TV rights to the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four and claimed the show \\"illegally borrows from it.\\"[121] Rosenblum accused the network of illegally using the Big Brother moniker from the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four and \\"deceiving the public into thinking the author's classic novel was the origin of the show.\\" CBS, Viacom, and Orwell Productions filed a motion to dismiss the $20 million lawsuit.[122] The dismissal was denied on January 4, 2001. In 2001 Rosenblum, CBS and Viacom settled the lawsuit under undisclosed terms.[123] The decision to select Chen as the host of the series caused much debate, mainly due to her role on the talk show The Early Show.[124] Andy Rooney of 60 Minutes said Chen's participation in the series was \\"a further deterioration of news standards\\", and further controversy arose when it was revealed some of Chen's lines had been scripted.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous events occurred during the game that sparked controversy as well. The show's security was breached early in the series when two publicity-seeking screenwriters threw a tennis ball stuffed with fake news stories - including one in which then President of the United States, Bill Clinton, purportedly called Big Brother a \\"national disgrace\\" - into the house's garden after finding it was unguarded. The HouseGuests were also communicated with by a plane towing a banner reading: \\"Big Brother is worse than you think. Get out now.\\"[21] The show also came under criticism after HouseGuest George Boswell's wife and family began campaigning for viewers to vote out some of the more popular HouseGuests to keep George in the game. Recently evicted HouseGuest Brittany, who was permitted to talk to Josh for a certain amount of time, informed Josh of this news. Various \\"anti-George\\" banners were flown over the house, leading Josh to inform them of the news.[126] Various other points in the game led to the HouseGuests feeling they were being portrayed poorly, and they would often be required to do acts they didn't necessarily feel like doing.[127] George then decided he would walk from the game, and attempted to convince the other HouseGuests to walk with him as well during a live episode.[51] Ultimately, none of the HouseGuests chose to leave the game. There was speculation that CBS had hired for the banners to be flown over the house, though this was never confirmed.[128]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the lack of strong ratings and numerous controversies surrounding the series, Big Brother did help earn CBS a 17% increase for its time slot, and was ultimately renewed in September 2000 for a second season.[129] It was then confirmed, however, that there would be numerous changes to the format of the series.[130]","input":"When did the first episode of big brother air?"},{"output":"eight","context":"The Cleveland Browns were a charter member club of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) when the league was founded in 1946.

In February 2012, Natalie Ravitz accepted a position to become Rupert Murdochs Chief of Staff at News Corporation.[4] News Corporation's board approved the split on May 24, 2013, while shareholders approved the split on June 11, 2013;[5] the company completed the split on June 28 and formally started trading on the NASDAQ on July 1.[6][7][8] Plans for the split were originally announced on June 28, 2012, while additional details and the working name of the new company were unveiled on December 3, 2012.[9][10][11]\\r\\nMurdoch stated that performing this split would \\"unlock the true value of both companies and their distinct assets, enabling investors to benefit from the separate strategic opportunities resulting from more focused management of each division.\\" The move also came in the wake of a series of scandals that had damaged the reputation of the company's publishing operations in the United Kingdom.[7][9] The split was structured so that the old News Corporation would change its name to 21st Century Fox and spin off its publishing assets into a \\"new\\" News Corporation.[8][12][13]\\r\\nWhile the company was originally announced as the Fox Group, on April 16, 2013, Murdoch announced the new name as a way to suggest the retaining of 20th Century Fox's heritage as the group advances into the future. Its logo was officially unveiled on May 9, 2013, featuring a modernized version of the iconic Fox searchlights.[14][15] However, the 21st Century Fox brand does not extend to the existing 20th Century Fox division (which remains under its original name).[16]\\r\\nThe formation of 21st Century Fox was officially finalized on June 28, 2013. It formally began trading on the NASDAQ and Australian Securities Exchange on July 1, 2013.[17][18]\\r\\nOn January 8, 2014, Rupert Murdoch announced plans to delist 21st Century Fox's shares from the Australian Securities Exchange, in favor of solely trading on the NASDAQ. Its listing in Australia was a holdover from its period as News Corporation, and 21st Century Fox has relatively little presence in Australia, unlike News Corp. Murdoch stated that the changes, which were expected to be complete by June 2014, would \\"simplify the capital and operating structure\\" of 21st Century Fox and provide \\"improved liquidity\\" to shareholders.[18][19] Also that month, the company acquired a majority ownership in YES Network, a New York regional sports network founded by the New York Yankees.[20]\\r\\nIn June 2014, 21st Century Fox made a bid to acquire Time Warner, which had similarly spun off its publishing assets, for $80 billion in a cash and stock deal. The deal, which was rejected by Time Warner's board of directors in July 2014, would have also involved the sale of CNN to ease antitrust issues.[21] On August 5, 2014, 21st Century Fox announced it had withdrawn its bid for Time Warner.[22] The company's stock had fallen sharply since the bid was announced, prompting directors to announce 21st Century Fox would buy back $6 billion of its shares over the following 12 months.[23]\\r\\nOn July 25, 2014, 21st Century Fox announced the sale of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland to BSkyB for $9 billion, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.[24] Fox would use the money from the sale, along with $25 billion it received from Goldman Sachs, to attempt another bid for Time Warner.[25]\\r\\nIn December 2014, Fox-owned television studio Shine Group merged with Apollo Global Management's Endemol and Core Media Group to form Endemol Shine Group, which is jointly owned by 21st Century Fox and Apollo.[26]\\r\\nOn September 9, 2015, 21st Century Fox announced a for-profit joint venture with the National Geographic Society, National Geographic Partners, which took ownership of all of National Geographic media and consumer businesses, including National Geographic magazine, and the National Geographic-branded television channels that were already run as a joint venture with Fox. 21st Century Fox holds a 73% stake in the company.[27][28]\\r\\nOn 9 December 2016, 21st Century Fox announced it had made an offer to acquire the 61% share of Sky plc that it did not already own.[29][30][31] The company was valued at S18.5 billion. The deal was approved by the European Commission on April 7, 2017,[32] followed by Ireland's Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment on June 27.[33] However, the deal has become subject to scrutiny and an extended regulatory review in the United Kingdom, over concerns surrounding the plurality of British news media that will be owned by the Murdoch family post-merger (counting Sky News, as well as News Corp's newspapers and recent acquisition of radio station operator Wireless Group), and violations of British news broadcasting regulations connected to Sky's former carriage of Fox News Channel in the country.[34][35][36][37]\\r\\nThe Kingdom Holding Company, owned by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, sold its minority stake in 21st Century Fox during the fiscal quarter ending September 2017. It previously held a 6% stake, which had been reduced to around 5% in 2015. The valuation of the shares, or who they were sold to, is unknown; Al-Waleed was the company's largest single shareholder behind the Murdoch family. The sale was reported after Al-Waleed was arrested in early-November 2017 as part of an anti-corruption probe by the Saudi government.[38]\\r\\nOn April 10, 2018, European Commission officials conducted an unannounced search of Fox Networks Group's West London offices, as part of an antitrust inquiry surrounding broadcast rights to sporting events.[39][40]\\r\\nOn December 14, 2017, after rumors of such a sale, The Walt Disney Company (which owns and operates ABC and ESPN) announced its intent to acquire 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion after the spin-off of certain businesses, pending regulatory approval.[41][42][43][44] 21st Century Fox president Peter Rice stated that he expected the sale to be completed by mid-2019.[45]\\r\\nUnder the terms of the deal, 21st Century Fox will spin off an entity being referred to as \\"New Fox\\", consisting of the Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox News, Fox Business Network, and the national operations of Fox Sports (such as Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2, and Big Ten Network, but excluding its regional sports networks), and Disney will acquire the remainder of 21st Century Fox.[41] This will include key entertainment assets such as the 20th Century Fox film studio and its subsidiaries, a stake in Hulu, the U.S. pay television subsidiaries FX Networks, Fox Sports Networks, and National Geographic Partners, and international operations such as Star TV and Sky plc. The acquisition is primarily intended to bolster two over-the-top content endeavorsESPN+ and a planned Disney entertainment service.[46][47] Disney will lease the 20th Century Fox backlot in Century City, Los Angeles for seven years.[48]\\r\\nThe proposed transaction has raised antitrust issues, due to concerns that it could lead to a tangible loss in competition in the film and sports broadcasting industries.[49][50] Several legal experts and industry analysts have expressed the opinion that the transaction is likely to receive regulatory approval, but would be scrutinized by regulators.[50][51]\\r\\nIn February 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported that Comcast, owner of NBCUniversal, was considering a counter-offer. Despite initially bidding $60 billion earlier, Fox had rejected Comcast's offer due to the possibility of antitrust concerns.[52][53]\\r\\nOn April 3, 2018, Fox stated that Disney had made a separate offer to purchase Sky News from Sky plc, as part of proposed regulatory remedies needed to expedite Fox's acquisition of the company.[54]\\r\\nOn May 5, 2018, it was reported that Comcast was preparing to make an unsolicited, all-cash counteroffer to acquire the 21st Century Fox's assets Disney has offered to purchase, contingent on the outcome of an antitrust lawsuit AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner.[55] Comcast had also made a competing bid to acquire Sky plc.[56][57][58] Comcast confirmed on May 23, 2018 that it was \\"considering, and is in advanced stages of preparing, an offer for the businesses that Fox has agreed to sell to Disney.\\"[59]\\r\\nA shareholder vote on the sale is scheduled for special shareholder meetings by Fox and Disney on July 10, 2018, at the New York Hilton Midtown and New Amsterdam Theatre respectively, although Fox warned that it may \\"postpone or adjourn\\" the meeting if Comcast does follow through with its intent to make a counter-offer. It was also reported that Disney was preparing an all-cash offer of its own to counter Comcast's bid.[60][61][62] On June 13, 2018, the day after AT&T was given an approval to merge with Time Warner, Comcast officially announced a $65 billion counter-offer to acquire the 21st Century Fox's assets Disney has offered to purchase.[63]\\r\\n21st Century Fox's operations can be broadly categorized into four major reporting segments:\\r\\nAmong the divisions of the company is Twentieth Century Fox Consumer Products which \\"licenses and markets properties worldwide\\" on behalf of a number of 21st Century Fox assets and third-parties.[65]\\r\\nAs of 2015[update], the senior vice president for government relations was Joe Welch.[66]\\r\\nOn its formation in 2013, Murdoch was chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company, while Chase Carey took the posts of president and chief operating officer.[67] Co-chairman and Co-CEO positions were created in 2014 and filled by Lachlan Murdoch and James Murdoch, respectively, both sons of Rupert Murdoch.[68]\\r\\nOn July 1, 2015, Lachlan Murdoch was elevated to Co-Executive Chairman alongside his father and James Murdoch replaced his father as CEO.[69] Former COO Chase Carey became Executive Vice Chairman.[70]\\r\\n21st Century Fox primarily consists of the media and broadcasting properties that were owned by its predecessor, such as the Fox Entertainment Group, STAR TV, and their 39.14% stake in Sky plc. News Corporation's broadcasting properties in Australia, such as Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, remain a part of the newly renamed News Corp Australiawhich was spun off with the new News Corp and is not a part of 21st Century Fox.[12]","input":"Who is the owner of 21st century fox?"},{"output":"sarsen","context":"Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument in Wiltshire, England, 2 miles (3?km) west of Amesbury. It consists of a ring of standing stones, with each standing stone around 13 feet (4.0?m) high, 7 feet (2.1?m) wide and weighing around 25 tons. The stones are set within earthworks in the middle of the most dense complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments in England, including several hundred burial mounds.[1]\\r\\nArchaeologists believe it was constructed from 3000 BC to 2000 BC. The surrounding circular earth bank and ditch, which constitute the earliest phase of the monument, have been dated to about 3100 BC. Radiocarbon dating suggests that the first bluestones were raised between 2400 and 2200 BC,[2] although they may have been at the site as early as 3000 BC.[3][4][5]\\r\\nOne of the most famous landmarks in the UK, Stonehenge is regarded as a British cultural icon.[6] It has been a legally protected Scheduled Ancient Monument since 1882 when legislation to protect historic monuments was first successfully introduced in Britain. The site and its surroundings were added to UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites in 1986. Stonehenge is owned by the Crown and managed by English Heritage; the surrounding land is owned by the National Trust.[7][8]\\r\\nStonehenge could have been a burial ground from its earliest beginnings.[9] Deposits containing human bone date from as early as 3000 BC, when the ditch and bank were first dug, and continued for at least another five hundred years.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oxford English Dictionary cites ?lfric's tenth-century glossary, in which henge-cliff is given the meaning \\"precipice\\", or stone, thus the stanenges or Stanheng \\"not far from Salisbury\\" recorded by eleventh-century writers are \\"supported stones\\". William Stukeley in 1740 notes, \\"Pendulous rocks are now called henges in Yorkshire...I doubt not, Stonehenge in Saxon signifies the hanging stones.\\"[11] Christopher Chippindale's Stonehenge Complete gives the derivation of the name Stonehenge as coming from the Old English words stn meaning \\"stone\\", and either hencg meaning \\"hinge\\" (because the stone lintels hinge on the upright stones) or hen(c)en meaning \\"hang\\" or \\"gallows\\" or \\"instrument of torture\\" (though elsewhere in his book, Chippindale cites the \\"suspended stones\\" etymology). Like Stonehenge's trilithons, medieval gallows consisted of two uprights with a lintel joining them, rather than the inverted L-shape more familiar today.\\r\\nThe \\"henge\\" portion has given its name to a class of monuments known as henges.[11] Archaeologists define henges as earthworks consisting of a circular banked enclosure with an internal ditch.[12] As often happens in archaeological terminology, this is a holdover from antiquarian use. Because its bank is inside its ditch, Stonehenge is not truly a henge site.\\r\\nDespite being contemporary with true Neolithic henges and stone circles, Stonehenge is in many ways atypicalfor example, at more than 7.3 metres (24?ft) tall, its extant trilithons' lintels, held in place with mortise and tenon joints, make it unique.[13][14]\\r\\nMike Parker Pearson, leader of the Stonehenge Riverside Project based at Durrington Walls, noted that Stonehenge appears to have been associated with burial from the earliest period of its existence:\\r\\nStonehenge was a place of burial from its beginning to its zenith in the mid third millennium B.C. The cremation burial dating to Stonehenge's sarsen stones phase is likely just one of many from this later period of the monument's use and demonstrates that it was still very much a domain of the dead.[10]\\r\\nStonehenge evolved in several construction phases spanning at least 1500 years. There is evidence of large-scale construction on and around the monument that perhaps extends the landscape's time frame to 6500 years. Dating and understanding the various phases of activity is complicated by disturbance of the natural chalk by periglacial effects and animal burrowing, poor quality early excavation records, and a lack of accurate, scientifically verified dates. The modern phasing most generally agreed to by archaeologists is detailed below. Features mentioned in the text are numbered and shown on the plan, right.\\r\\nArchaeologists have found four, or possibly five, large Mesolithic postholes (one may have been a natural tree throw), which date to around 8000 BC, beneath the nearby modern tourist car-park. These held pine posts around 0.75 metres (2?ft 6?in) in diameter, which were erected and eventually rotted in situ. Three of the posts (and possibly four) were in an east-west alignment which may have had ritual significance.[citation needed] Another Mesolithic astronomical site in Britain is the Warren Field site in Aberdeenshire, which is considered the world's oldest Lunar calendar, corrected yearly by observing the midwinter solstice. Similar but later sites have been found in Scandinavia.[citation needed] A settlement that may have been contemporaneous with the posts has been found at Blick Mead, a reliable year-round spring 1 mile (1.6?km) from Stonehenge.[15][16]\\r\\nSalisbury Plain was then still wooded, but 4,000 years later, during the earlier Neolithic, people built a causewayed enclosure at Robin Hood's Ball and long barrow tombs in the surrounding landscape. In approximately 3500 BC, a Stonehenge Cursus was built 700 metres (2,300?ft) north of the site as the first farmers began to clear the trees and develop the area. A number of other adjacent stone and wooden structures and burial mounds, previously overlooked, may date as far back as 4000 BC.[17] Charcoal from the Blick Mead camp 2.4 kilometres (1.5?mi) from Stonehenge (near the Vespasian's Camp site) has been dated to 4000 BC.[18] The University of Buckingham's Humanities Research Institute believes that the community who built Stonehenge lived here over a period of several millennia, making it potentially \\"one of the pivotal places in the history of the Stonehenge landscape.\\"[19]\\r\\nThe first monument consisted of a circular bank and ditch enclosure made of Late Cretaceous (Santonian Age) Seaford Chalk, measuring about 110 metres (360?ft) in diameter, with a large entrance to the north east and a smaller one to the south. It stood in open grassland on a slightly sloping spot.[20] The builders placed the bones of deer and oxen in the bottom of the ditch, as well as some worked flint tools. The bones were considerably older than the antler picks used to dig the ditch, and the people who buried them had looked after them for some time prior to burial. The ditch was continuous but had been dug in sections, like the ditches of the earlier causewayed enclosures in the area. The chalk dug from the ditch was piled up to form the bank. This first stage is dated to around 3100 BC, after which the ditch began to silt up naturally. Within the outer edge of the enclosed area is a circle of 56 pits, each about a metre (3?ft 3?in) in diameter, known as the Aubrey holes after John Aubrey, the seventeenth-century antiquarian who was thought to have first identified them. The pits may have contained standing timbers creating a timber circle, although there is no excavated evidence of them. A recent excavation has suggested that the Aubrey Holes may have originally been used to erect a bluestone circle.[21] If this were the case, it would advance the earliest known stone structure at the monument by some 500 years. A small outer bank beyond the ditch could also date to this period.\\r\\nIn 2013 a team of archaeologists, led by Mike Parker Pearson, excavated more than 50,000 cremated bones of 63 individuals buried at Stonehenge.[3][4] These remains had originally been buried individually in the Aubrey holes, exhumed during a previous excavation conducted by William Hawley in 1920, been considered unimportant by him, and subsequently re-interred together in one hole, Aubrey Hole 7, in 1935.[22] Physical and chemical analysis of the remains has shown that the cremated were almost equally men and women, and included some children.[3][4] As there was evidence of the underlying chalk beneath the graves being crushed by substantial weight, the team concluded that the first bluestones brought from Wales were probably used as grave markers.[3][4] Radiocarbon dating of the remains has put the date of the site 500 years earlier than previously estimated, to around 3000 BC.[3][4]\\r\\nAnalysis of animal teeth found at nearby Durrington Walls, thought to be the 'builders camp', suggests that as many as 4,000 people gathered at the site for the mid-winter and mid-summer festivals; the evidence showed that the animals had been slaughtered around 9 months or 15 months after their spring birth. Strontium isotope analysis of the animal teeth showed that some had been brought from as far afield as the Scottish Highlands for the celebrations.[4][5]\\r\\nEvidence of the second phase is no longer visible. The number of postholes dating to the early 3rd millennium BC suggest that some form of timber structure was built within the enclosure during this period. Further standing timbers were placed at the northeast entrance, and a parallel alignment of posts ran inwards from the southern entrance. The postholes are smaller than the Aubrey Holes, being only around 0.4 metres (16?in) in diameter, and are much less regularly spaced. The bank was purposely reduced in height and the ditch continued to silt up. At least twenty-five of the Aubrey Holes are known to have contained later, intrusive, cremation burials dating to the two centuries after the monument's inception. It seems that whatever the holes' initial function, it changed to become a funerary one during Phase 2. Thirty further cremations were placed in the enclosure's ditch and at other points within the monument, mostly in the eastern half. Stonehenge is therefore interpreted as functioning as an enclosed cremation cemetery at this time, the earliest known cremation cemetery in the British Isles. Fragments of unburnt human bone have also been found in the ditch-fill. Dating evidence is provided by the late Neolithic grooved ware pottery that has been found in connection with the features from this phase.\\r\\nArchaeological excavation has indicated that around 2600 BC, the builders abandoned timber in favour of stone and dug two concentric arrays of holes (the Q and R Holes) in the centre of the site. These stone sockets are only partly known (hence on present evidence are sometimes described as forming 'crescents'); however, they could be the remains of a double ring. Again, there is little firm dating evidence for this phase. The holes held up to 80 standing stones (shown blue on the plan), only 43 of which can be traced today. It is generally accepted that the bluestones (some of which are made of dolerite, an igneous rock), were transported by the builders from the Preseli Hills, 150 miles (240?km) away in modern-day Pembrokeshire in Wales. Another theory is that they were brought much nearer to the site as glacial erratics by the Irish Sea Glacier[23] although there is no evidence of glacial deposition within southern central England.[24]\\r\\nThe long distance human transport theory was bolstered in 2011 by the discovery of a megalithic bluestone quarry at Craig Rhos-y-felin, near Crymych in Pembrokeshire, which is the most likely place for some of the stones to have been obtained.[24] Other standing stones may well have been small sarsens (sandstone), used later as lintels. The stones, which weighed about two tons, could have been moved by lifting and carrying them on rows of poles and rectangular frameworks of poles, as recorded in China, Japan and India. It is not known whether the stones were taken directly from their quarries to Salisbury Plain or were the result of the removal of a venerated stone circle from Preseli to Salisbury Plain to \\"merge two sacred centres into one, to unify two politically separate regions, or to legitimise the ancestral identity of migrants moving from one region to another\\".[24] Each monolith measures around 2 metres (6.6?ft) in height, between 1 and 1.5?m (3.3 and 4.9?ft) wide and around 0.8 metres (2.6?ft) thick. What was to become known as the Altar Stone is almost certainly derived from the Senni Beds, perhaps from 50 miles (80 kilometres) east of Mynydd Preseli in the Brecon Beacons.[24]\\r\\nThe north-eastern entrance was widened at this time, with the result that it precisely matched the direction of the midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset of the period. This phase of the monument was abandoned unfinished, however; the small standing stones were apparently removed and the Q and R holes purposefully backfilled. Even so, the monument appears to have eclipsed the site at Avebury in importance towards the end of this phase.\\r\\nThe Heelstone, a Tertiary sandstone, may also have been erected outside the north-eastern entrance during this period. It cannot be accurately dated and may have been installed at any time during phase 3. At first it was accompanied by a second stone, which is no longer visible. Two, or possibly three, large portal stones were set up just inside the north-eastern entrance, of which only one, the fallen Slaughter Stone, 4.9 metres (16?ft) long, now remains. Other features, loosely dated to phase 3, include the four Station Stones, two of which stood atop mounds. The mounds are known as \\"barrows\\" although they do not contain burials. Stonehenge Avenue, a parallel pair of ditches and banks leading 2 miles (3?km) to the River Avon, was also added. Two ditches similar to Heelstone Ditch circling the Heelstone (which was by then reduced to a single monolith) were later dug around the Station Stones.\\r\\nDuring the next major phase of activity, 30 enormous Oligocene-Miocene sarsen stones (shown grey on the plan) were brought to the site. They may have come from a quarry around 25 miles (40?km) north of Stonehenge on the Marlborough Downs, or they may have been collected from a \\"litter\\" of sarsens on the chalk downs, closer to hand. The stones were dressed and fashioned with mortise and tenon joints before 30 were erected as a 33 metres (108?ft) diameter circle of standing stones, with a ring of 30 lintel stones resting on top. The lintels were fitted to one another using another woodworking method, the tongue and groove joint. Each standing stone was around 4.1 metres (13?ft) high, 2.1 metres (6?ft 11?in) wide and weighed around 25 tons. Each had clearly been worked with the final visual effect in mind; the orthostats widen slightly towards the top in order that their perspective remains constant when viewed from the ground, while the lintel stones curve slightly to continue the circular appearance of the earlier monument.\\r\\nThe inward-facing surfaces of the stones are smoother and more finely worked than the outer surfaces. The average thickness of the stones is 1.1 metres (3?ft 7?in) and the average distance between them is 1 metre (3?ft 3?in). A total of 75 stones would have been needed to complete the circle (60 stones) and the trilithon horseshoe (15 stones). It was thought the ring might have been left incomplete, but an exceptionally dry summer in 2013 revealed patches of parched grass which may correspond to the location of removed sarsens.[25] The lintel stones are each around 3.2 metres (10?ft) long, 1 metre (3?ft 3?in) wide and 0.8 metres (2?ft 7?in) thick. The tops of the lintels are 4.9 metres (16?ft) above the ground.\\r\\nWithin this circle stood five trilithons of dressed sarsen stone arranged in a horseshoe shape 13.7 metres (45?ft) across, with its open end facing north east. These huge stones, ten uprights and five lintels, weigh up to 50 tons each. They were linked using complex jointing. They are arranged symmetrically. The smallest pair of trilithons were around 6 metres (20?ft) tall, the next pair a little higher, and the largest, single trilithon in the south west corner would have been 7.3 metres (24?ft) tall. Only one upright from the Great Trilithon still stands, of which 6.7 metres (22?ft) is visible and a further 2.4 metres (7?ft 10?in) is below ground. The images of a 'dagger' and 14 'axeheads' have been carved on one of the sarsens, known as stone 53; further carvings of axeheads have been seen on the outer faces of stones 3, 4, and 5. The carvings are difficult to date, but are morphologically similar to late Bronze Age weapons. Early 21st-century laser scanning of the carvings supports this interpretation. The pair of trilithons in the north east are smallest, measuring around 6 metres (20?ft) in height; the largest, which is in the south west of the horseshoe, is almost 7.5 metres (25?ft) tall.\\r\\nThis ambitious phase has been radiocarbon dated to between 2600 and 2400 BC,[26] slightly earlier than the Stonehenge Archer, discovered in the outer ditch of the monument in 1978, and the two sets of burials, known as the Amesbury Archer and the Boscombe Bowmen, discovered 3 miles (5?km) to the west. At about the same time, a large timber circle and a second avenue were constructed 2 miles (3?km) away at Durrington Walls overlooking the River Avon. The timber circle was oriented towards the rising sun on the midwinter solstice, opposing the solar alignments at Stonehenge. The avenue was aligned with the setting sun on the summer solstice and led from the river to the timber circle. Evidence of huge fires on the banks of the Avon between the two avenues also suggests that both circles were linked. They were perhaps used as a procession route on the longest and shortest days of the year. Parker Pearson speculates that the wooden circle at Durrington Walls was the centre of a 'land of the living', whilst the stone circle represented a 'land of the dead', with the Avon serving as a journey between the two.[27]\\r\\nLater in the Bronze Age, although the exact details of activities during this period are still unclear, the bluestones appear to have been re-erected. They were placed within the outer sarsen circle and may have been trimmed in some way. Like the sarsens, a few have timber-working style cuts in them suggesting that, during this phase, they may have been linked with lintels and were part of a larger structure.\\r\\nThis phase saw further rearrangement of the bluestones. They were arranged in a circle between the two rings of sarsens and in an oval at the centre of the inner ring. Some archaeologists argue that some of these bluestones were from a second group brought from Wales. All the stones formed well-spaced uprights without any of the linking lintels inferred in Stonehenge 3 III. The Altar Stone may have been moved within the oval at this time and re-erected vertically. Although this would seem the most impressive phase of work, Stonehenge 3 IV was rather shabbily built compared to its immediate predecessors, as the newly re-installed bluestones were not well-founded and began to fall over. However, only minor changes were made after this phase.\\r\\nSoon afterwards, the north eastern section of the Phase 3 IV bluestone circle was removed, creating a horseshoe-shaped setting (the Bluestone Horseshoe) which mirrored the shape of the central sarsen Trilithons. This phase is contemporary with the Seahenge site in Norfolk.\\r\\nThe Y and Z Holes are the last known construction at Stonehenge, built about 1600 BC, and the last usage of it was probably during the Iron Age. Roman coins and medieval artefacts have all been found in or around the monument but it is unknown if the monument was in continuous use throughout British prehistory and beyond, or exactly how it would have been used. Notable is the massive Iron Age hillfort Vespasian's Camp built alongside the Avenue near the Avon. A decapitated seventh century Saxon man was excavated from Stonehenge in 1923.[28] The site was known to scholars during the Middle Ages and since then it has been studied and adopted by numerous groups.\\r\\nStonehenge was produced by a culture that left no written records. Many aspects of Stonehenge, such as how it was built and which purposes it was used for, remain subject to debate. A number of myths surround the stones.[29] The site, specifically the great trilithon, the encompassing horseshoe arrangement of the five central trilithons, the heel stone, and the embanked avenue, are aligned to the sunset of the winter solstice and the opposing sunrise of the summer solstice.[30][31] A natural landform at the monument's location followed this line, and may have inspired its construction.[32] The excavated remains of culled animal bones suggest that people may have gathered at the site for the winter rather than the summer.[33] Further astronomical associations, and the precise astronomical significance of the site for its people, are a matter of speculation and debate.\\r\\nThere is little or no direct evidence revealing the construction techniques used by the Stonehenge builders. Over the years, various authors have suggested that supernatural or anachronistic methods were used, usually asserting that the stones were impossible to move otherwise due to their massive size. However, conventional techniques, using Neolithic technology as basic as shear legs, have been demonstrably effective at moving and placing stones of a similar size.[citation needed] How the stones could be transported by a prehistoric people without the aid of the wheel or a pulley system is not known. The most common theory of how prehistoric people moved megaliths has them creating a track of logs on which the large stones were rolled along.[34] Another megalith transport theory involves the use of a type of sleigh running on a track greased with animal fat.[34] Such an experiment with a sleigh carrying a 40-ton slab of stone was successful near Stonehenge in 1995. A dedicated team of more than 100 workers managed to push and pull the slab along the 18-mile (29?km) journey from Marlborough Downs.[34] Proposed functions for the site include usage as an astronomical observatory or as a religious site.\\r\\nMore recently two major new theories have been proposed. Professor Geoffrey Wainwright, president of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and Timothy Darvill, of Bournemouth University, have suggested that Stonehenge was a place of healingthe primeval equivalent of Lourdes.[35] They argue that this accounts for the high number of burials in the area and for the evidence of trauma deformity in some of the graves. However, they do concede that the site was probably multifunctional and used for ancestor worship as well.[36] Isotope analysis indicates that some of the buried individuals were from other regions. A teenage boy buried approximately 1550 BC was raised near the Mediterranean Sea; a metal worker from 2300 BC dubbed the \\"Amesbury Archer\\" grew up near the alpine foothills of Germany; and the \\"Boscombe Bowmen\\" probably arrived from Wales or Brittany, France.[37]\\r\\nOn the other hand, Mike Parker Pearson of Sheffield University has suggested that Stonehenge was part of a ritual landscape and was joined to Durrington Walls by their corresponding avenues and the River Avon. He suggests that the area around Durrington Walls Henge was a place of the living, whilst Stonehenge was a domain of the dead. A journey along the Avon to reach Stonehenge was part of a ritual passage from life to death, to celebrate past ancestors and the recently deceased.[27] Both explanations were first mooted in the twelfth century by Geoffrey of Monmouth, who extolled the curative properties of the stones and was also the first to advance the idea that Stonehenge was constructed as a funerary monument. Whatever religious, mystical or spiritual elements were central to Stonehenge, its design includes a celestial observatory function, which might have allowed prediction of eclipse, solstice, equinox and other celestial events important to a contemporary religion.[38]\\r\\nThere are other hypotheses and theories. According to a team of British researchers led by Mike Parker Pearson of the University of Sheffield, Stonehenge may have been built as a symbol of \\"peace and unity\\", indicated in part by the fact that at the time of its construction, Britain's Neolithic people were experiencing a period of cultural unification.[29][39]\\r\\nResearchers from the Royal College of Art in London have discovered that the monuments bluestones possess \\"unusual acoustic properties\\"? when struck they respond with a \\"loud clanging noise\\". According to Paul Devereux, editor of the journal Time and Mind: The Journal of Archaeology, Consciousness and Culture, this idea could explain why certain bluestones were hauled nearly 200 miles (320?km)a major technical accomplishment at the time. In certain ancient cultures rocks that ring out, known as lithophones, were believed to contain mystic or healing powers, and Stonehenge has a history of association with rituals. The presence of these \\"ringing rocks\\" seems to support the hypothesis that Stonehenge was a \\"place for healing\\", as has been pointed out by Bournemouth University archaeologist Timothy Darvill, who consulted with the researchers. The bluestones of Stonehenge were quarried near a town in Wales called Maenclochog, which means \\"ringing rock\\", where the local bluestones were used as church bells until the 18th century.[40]\\r\\nThe Heel Stone lies north east of the sarsen circle, beside the end portion of Stonehenge Avenue.[41] It is a rough stone, 16 feet (4.9?m) above ground, leaning inwards towards the stone circle.[41] It has been known by many names in the past, including \\"Friar's Heel\\" and \\"Sun-stone\\".[42][43] At summer solstice an observer standing within the stone circle, looking north-east through the entrance, would see the Sun rise in the approximate direction of the heel stone, and the sun has often been photographed over it.\\r\\nA folk tale relates the origin of the Friar's Heel reference.[44][45]\\r\\nThe name is not unique; there was a monolith with the same name recorded in the nineteenth century by antiquarian Charles Warne at Long Bredy in Dorset.[47]\\r\\nIn the twelfth century, Geoffrey of Monmouth included a fanciful story in his Historia Regum Britanniae (\\"History of the Kings of Britain\\") that attributed the monument's construction to the wizard Merlin.[48] Geoffrey's story spread widely, appearing in more and less elaborate form in adaptations of his work such as Wace's Norman French Roman de Brut, Layamon's Middle English Brut, and the Welsh Brut y Brenhinedd.\\r\\nAccording to Geoffrey the rocks of Stonehenge were healing rocks, called the Giant's dance, which Giants had brought from Africa to Ireland for their healing properties. The fifth-century king Aurelius Ambrosius wished to erect a memorial to 3,000 nobles slain in battle against the Saxons and buried at Salisbury, and at Merlin's advice chose Stonehenge. The king sent Merlin, Uther Pendragon (King Arthur's father), and 15,000 knights, to remove it from Ireland, where it had been constructed on Mount Killaraus by the Giants. They slew 7,000 Irish but, as the knights tried to move the rocks with ropes and force, they failed. Then Merlin, using \\"gear\\" and skill, easily dismantled the stones and sent them over to Britain, where Stonehenge was dedicated. After it had been rebuilt near Amesbury, Geoffrey further narrates how first Ambrosius Aurelianus, then Uther Pendragon, and finally Constantine III, were buried inside the \\"Giants' Ring of Stonehenge\\".\\r\\nIn another legend of Saxons and Britons, in 472 the invading king Hengist invited Brythonic warriors to a feast, but treacherously ordered his men to draw their weapons from concealment and fall upon the guests, killing 420 of them. Hengist erected the stone monumentStonehengeon the site to show his remorse for the deed.[49]\\r\\nStonehenge has changed ownership several times since King Henry VIII acquired Amesbury Abbey and its surrounding lands. In 1540 Henry gave the estate to the Earl of Hertford. It subsequently passed to Lord Carleton and then the Marquess of Queensberry. The Antrobus family of Cheshire bought the estate in 1824. During World War I an aerodrome (Royal Flying Corps \\"No. 1 School of Aerial Navigation and Bomb Dropping\\")[50] was built on the downs just to the west of the circle and, in the dry valley at Stonehenge Bottom, a main road junction was built, along with several cottages and a cafe. The Antrobus family sold the site after their last heir was killed in the fighting in France. The auction by Knight Frank & Rutley estate agents in Salisbury was held on 21 September 1915 and included \\"Lot 15. Stonehenge with about 30 acres, 2 rods, 37 perches [12.44?ha] of adjoining downland.\\"[51]\\r\\nCecil Chubb bought the site for S6,600 and gave it to the nation three years later. Although it has been speculated that he purchased it at the suggestion ofor even as a present forhis wife, in fact he bought it on a whim, as he believed a local man should be the new owner.[51]\\r\\nIn the late 1920s a nationwide appeal was launched to save Stonehenge from the encroachment of the modern buildings that had begun to rise around it.[52] By 1928 the land around the monument had been purchased with the appeal donations, and given to the National Trust to preserve. The buildings were removed (although the roads were not), and the land returned to agriculture. More recently the land has been part of a grassland reversion scheme, returning the surrounding fields to native chalk grassland.[53]\\r\\nDuring the twentieth century, Stonehenge began to revive as a place of religious significance, this time by adherents of Neopaganism and New Age beliefs, particularly the Neo-druids. The historian Ronald Hutton would later remark that \\"it was a great, and potentially uncomfortable, irony that modern Druids had arrived at Stonehenge just as archaeologists were evicting the ancient Druids from it.\\"[54] The first such Neo-druidic group to make use of the megalithic monument was the Ancient Order of Druids, who performed a mass initiation ceremony there in August 1905, in which they admitted 259 new members into their organisation. This assembly was largely ridiculed in the press, who mocked the fact that the Neo-druids were dressed up in costumes consisting of white robes and fake beards.[55]\\r\\nBetween 1972 and 1984, Stonehenge was the site of the Stonehenge Free Festival. After the Battle of the Beanfield in 1985, this use of the site was stopped for several years and ritual use of Stonehenge is now heavily restricted.[56] Some Druids have arranged an assembling of monuments styled on Stonehenge in other parts of the world as a form of Druidist worship.[57]\\r\\nWhen Stonehenge was first opened to the public it was possible to walk among and even climb on the stones, but the stones were roped off in 1977 as a result of serious erosion.[58] Visitors are no longer permitted to touch the stones, but are able to walk around the monument from a short distance away. English Heritage does, however, permit access during the summer and winter solstice, and the spring and autumn equinox. Additionally, visitors can make special bookings to access the stones throughout the year.[59]\\r\\nThe access situation and the proximity of the two roads has drawn widespread criticism, highlighted by a 2006 National Geographic survey. In the survey of conditions at 94 leading World Heritage Sites, 400 conservation and tourism experts ranked Stonehenge 75th in the list of destinations, declaring it to be \\"in moderate trouble\\".[60]\\r\\nAs motorised traffic increased, the setting of the monument began to be affected by the proximity of the two roads on either sidethe A344 to Shrewton on the north side, and the A303 to Winterbourne Stoke to the south. Plans to upgrade the A303 and close the A344 to restore the vista from the stones have been considered since the monument became a World Heritage Site. However, the controversy surrounding expensive re-routing of the roads has led to the scheme being cancelled on multiple occasions. On 6 December 2007, it was announced that extensive plans to build Stonehenge road tunnel under the landscape and create a permanent visitors' centre had been cancelled.[61]\\r\\nOn 13 May 2009, the government gave approval for a S25?million scheme to create a smaller visitors' centre and close the A344, although this was dependent on funding and local authority planning consent.[62] On 20 January 2010 Wiltshire Council granted planning permission for a centre 2.4?km (1.5 miles) to the west and English Heritage confirmed that funds to build it would be available, supported by a S10m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.[63] On 23 June 2013 the A344 was closed to begin the work of removing the section of road and replacing it with grass.[64][65] The centre, designed by Denton Corker Marshall, opened to the public on 18 December 2013.[66]\\r\\nThe earlier rituals were augmented by the Stonehenge Free Festival, loosely organised by the Politantric Circle, held between 1972 and 1984, during which time the number of midsummer visitors had risen to around 30,000.[67] However, in 1985 the site was closed to festivalgoers by English Heritage and the National Trust. A consequence of the end of the festival in 1985 was the violent confrontation between the police and New Age travellers that became known as the Battle of the Beanfield when police blockaded a convoy of travellers to prevent them from approaching Stonehenge. Beginning in 1985, the year of the Battle, no access was allowed into the stones at Stonehenge for any religious reason. This 'exclusion-zone' policy continued for almost fifteen years: until just before the arrival of the twenty-first century, visitors were not allowed to go into the stones at times of religious significance, the winter and summer solstices, and the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.[68]\\r\\nHowever, now due to the Roundtable process and the 'Court of Human Rights' rulings gained by picketing by campaigners such as Brian \\"Viziondanz\\" Felstein and King Arthur Pendragon, some access had been gained four times a year. The 'Court of Human Rights' rulings recognises that members of any genuine religion have a right to worship in their own church, and Stonehenge is a place of worship to Neo-Druids, Pagans and other 'Earth based' or 'old' religions. The Roundtable meetings include members of the Wiltshire Police force, National Trust, English Heritage, Pagans, Druids, Spiritualists and others.\\r\\nAt the Summer Solstice 2003, which fell over a weekend, over 30,000 people attended a gathering at and in the stones. The 2004 gathering was smaller (around 21,000 people).\\r\\n{{{annotations}}}\\r\\nThroughout recorded history, Stonehenge and its surrounding monuments have attracted attention from antiquarians and archaeologists. John Aubrey was one of the first to examine the site with a scientific eye in 1666, and recorded in his plan of the monument the pits that now bear his name. William Stukeley continued Aubreys work in the early eighteenth century, but took an interest in the surrounding monuments as well, identifying (somewhat incorrectly) the Cursus and the Avenue. He also began the excavation of many of the barrows in the area, and it was his interpretation of the landscape that associated it with the Druids.[69] Stukeley was so fascinated with Druids that he originally named Disc Barrows as Druids' Barrows. The most accurate early plan of Stonehenge was that made by Bath architect John Wood in 1740.[70] His original annotated survey has recently been computer redrawn and published.[71][page?needed] Importantly Woods plan was made before the collapse of the southwest trilithon, which fell in 1797 and was restored in 1958.\\r\\nWilliam Cunnington was the next to tackle the area in the early nineteenth century. He excavated some 24 barrows before digging in and around the stones and discovered charred wood, animal bones, pottery and urns. He also identified the hole in which the Slaughter Stone once stood. Richard Colt Hoare supported Cunnington's work and excavated some 379 barrows on Salisbury Plain including on some 200 in the area around the Stones, some excavated in conjunction with William Coxe. To alert future diggers to their work they were careful to leave initialled metal tokens in each barrow they opened. Cunnington's finds are displayed at the Wiltshire Museum. In 1877 Charles Darwin dabbled in archaeology at the stones, experimenting with the rate at which remains sink into the earth for his book The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms.\\r\\nWilliam Gowland oversaw the first major restoration of the monument in 1901 which involved the straightening and concrete setting of sarsen stone number 56 which was in danger of falling. In straightening the stone he moved it about half a metre from its original position.[71] Gowland also took the opportunity to further excavate the monument in what was the most scientific dig to date, revealing more about the erection of the stones than the previous 100 years of work had done. During the 1920 restoration William Hawley, who had excavated nearby Old Sarum, excavated the base of six stones and the outer ditch. He also located a bottle of port in the Slaughter Stone socket left by Cunnington, helped to rediscover Aubrey's pits inside the bank and located the concentric circular holes outside the Sarsen Circle called the Y and Z Holes.[72]\\r\\nRichard Atkinson, Stuart Piggott and John F. S. Stone re-excavated much of Hawley's work in the 1940s and 1950s, and discovered the carved axes and daggers on the Sarsen Stones. Atkinson's work was instrumental in furthering the understanding of the three major phases of the monument's construction.\\r\\nIn 1958 the stones were restored again, when three of the standing sarsens were re-erected and set in concrete bases. The last restoration was carried out in 1963 after stone 23 of the Sarsen Circle fell over. It was again re-erected, and the opportunity was taken to concrete three more stones. Later archaeologists, including Christopher Chippindale of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge and Brian Edwards of the University of the West of England, campaigned to give the public more knowledge of the various restorations and in 2004 English Heritage included pictures of the work in progress in its book Stonehenge: A History in Photographs.[73][74][75]\\r\\nIn 1966 and 1967, in advance of a new car park being built at the site, the area of land immediately northwest of the stones was excavated by Faith and Lance Vatcher. They discovered the Mesolithic postholes dating from between 7000 and 8000 BC, as well as a 10-metre (33?ft) length of a palisade ditch?ÿ a V-cut ditch into which timber posts had been inserted that remained there until they rotted away. Subsequent aerial archaeology suggests that this ditch runs from the west to the north of Stonehenge, near the avenue.[72]\\r\\nExcavations were once again carried out in 1978 by Atkinson and John Evans during which they discovered the remains of the Stonehenge Archer in the outer ditch,[76] and in 1979 rescue archaeology was needed alongside the Heel Stone after a cable-laying ditch was mistakenly dug on the roadside, revealing a new stone hole next to the Heel Stone.\\r\\nIn the early 1980s Julian Richards led the Stonehenge Environs Project, a detailed study of the surrounding landscape. The project was able to successfully date such features as the Lesser Cursus, Coneybury Henge and several other smaller features.\\r\\nIn 1993 the way that Stonehenge was presented to the public was called 'a national disgrace' by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee. Part of English Heritage's response to this criticism was to commission research to collate and bring together all the archaeological work conducted at the monument up to this date. This two-year research project resulted in the publication in 1995 of the monograph Stonehenge in its landscape, which was the first publication presenting the complex stratigraphy and the finds recovered from the site. It presented a rephasing of the monument.[77]\\r\\nMore recent excavations include a series of digs held between 2003 and 2008 known as the Stonehenge Riverside Project, led by Mike Parker Pearson. This project mainly investigated other monuments in the landscape and their relationship to the stones? notably Durrington Walls, where another \\"Avenue\\" leading to the River Avon was discovered. The point where the Stonehenge Avenue meets the river was also excavated, and revealed a previously unknown circular area which probably housed four further stones, most likely as a marker for the starting point of the avenue. In April 2008 Tim Darvill of the University of Bournemouth and Geoff Wainwright of the Society of Antiquaries, began another dig inside the stone circle to retrieve dateable fragments of the original bluestone pillars. They were able to date the erection of some bluestones to 2300 BC,[2] although this may not reflect the earliest erection of stones at Stonehenge. They also discovered organic material from 7000 BC, which, along with the Mesolithic postholes, adds support for the site having been in use at least 4,000 years before Stonehenge was started. In August and September 2008, as part of the Riverside Project, Julian Richards and Mike Pitts excavated Aubrey Hole 7, removing the cremated remains from several Aubrey Holes that had been excavated by Hawley in the 1920s, and re-interred in 1935.[22] A licence for the removal of human remains at Stonehenge had been granted by the Ministry of Justice in May 2008, in accordance with the Statement on burial law and archaeology issued in May 2008. One of the conditions of the licence was that the remains should be reinterred within two years and that in the intervening period they should be kept safely, privately and decently.[78][79]\\r\\nA new landscape investigation was conducted in April 2009. A shallow mound, rising to about 40?cm (16 inches) was identified between stones 54 (inner circle) and 10 (outer circle), clearly separated from the natural slope. It has not been dated but speculation that it represents careless backfilling following earlier excavations seems disproved by its representation in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century illustrations. Indeed, there is some evidence that, as an uncommon geological feature, it could have been deliberately incorporated into the monument at the outset.[20] A circular, shallow bank, little more than 10?cm (4 inches) high, was found between the Y and Z hole circles, with a further bank lying inside the \\"Z\\" circle. These are interpreted as the spread of spoil from the original Y and Z holes, or more speculatively as hedge banks from vegetation deliberately planted to screen the activities within.[20]\\r\\nIn July 2010, the Stonehenge Hidden Landscape Project discovered a \\"henge-like\\" monument less than 1?km (0.62 miles) away from the main site.[80] This new hengiform monument was subsequently revealed to be located \\"at the site of Amesbury 50\\", a round barrow in the Cursus Barrows group.[81]\\r\\nOn 26 November 2011, archaeologists from University of Birmingham announced the discovery of evidence of two huge pits positioned within the Stonehenge Cursus pathway, aligned in celestial position towards midsummer sunrise and sunset when viewed from the Heel Stone.[82][83] The new discovery is part of the Stonehenge Hidden Landscape Project which began in the summer of 2010.[84] The project uses non-invasive geophysical imaging technique to reveal and visually recreate the landscape. According to team leader Vince Gaffney, this discovery may provide a direct link between the rituals and astronomical events to activities within the Cursus at Stonehenge.[83]\\r\\nOn 18 December 2011, geologists from University of Leicester and the National Museum of Wales announced the discovery of the exact source of some of the rhyolite fragments found in the Stonehenge debitage. These fragments do not seem to match any of the standing stones or bluestone stumps. The researchers have identified the source as a 70-metre (230?ft) long rock outcrop called Craig Rhos-y-Felin (515930.07N 44440.85W? / ?51.9916861N 4.7446806W? / 51.9916861; -4.7446806? (Craig Rhos-y-Felin)), near Pont Saeson in north Pembrokeshire, located 220 kilometres (140?mi) from Stonehenge.[85][86]\\r\\nOn 10 September 2014 the University of Birmingham announced findings including evidence of adjacent stone and wooden structures and burial mounds, overlooked previously, that may date as far back as 4000 BC.[17] An area extending to 12 square kilometres (1,200?ha) was studied to a depth of three metres with ground-penetrating radar equipment. As many as seventeen new monuments, revealed nearby, may be Late Neolithic monuments that resemble Stonehenge. The interpretation suggests a complex of numerous related monuments. Also included in the discovery is that the cursus track is terminated by two five-meter wide extremely deep pits,[87] whose purpose is still a mystery.","input":"What type of stone is stonehenge made of?"},{"output":"An earthquake","context":"On May 18, 1980, a major volcanic eruption occurred at Mount St. Helens, a volcano located in Skamania County, in the state of Washington, United States. The eruption (a VEI 5 event) was the only significant volcanic eruption to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states since the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak in California.[1] However, it has often been declared as the most disastrous volcanic eruption in United States history. The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes, caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on the mountain's north slope.\\r\\nAn earthquake at 8:32:17?a.m. PDT (UTC?7) on Sunday, May 18, 1980, caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, creating the largest landslide ever recorded. This allowed the partly molten, high-pressure gas- and steam-rich rock in the volcano to suddenly explode northwards toward Spirit Lake in a hot mix of lava and pulverized older rock, overtaking the avalanching face.\\r\\nAn eruption column rose 80,000 feet (24?km; 15?mi) into the atmosphere and deposited ash in 11 U.S. states.[2] At the same time, snow, ice and several entire glaciers on the volcano melted, forming a series of large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that reached as far as the Columbia River, nearly 50 miles (80?km) to the southwest. Less severe outbursts continued into the next day, only to be followed by other large, but not as destructive, eruptions later that year. Thermal energy released during the eruption was equal to 26 megatons. [3]\\r\\nApproximately 57 people were killed directly, including innkeeper Harry R. Truman, photographers Reid Blackburn and Robert Landsburg, and geologist David A. Johnston.[4] Hundreds of square miles were reduced to wasteland, causing over a billion U.S. dollars in damage ($3.03 billion in 2017 dollars[5]), thousands of animals were killed, and Mount St. Helens was left with a crater on its north side. At the time of the eruption, the summit of the volcano was owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad, but afterward the land passed to the United States Forest Service.[6] The area was later preserved, as it was, in the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMount St. Helens remained dormant from its last period of activity in the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980.[7] Several small earthquakes, apparently beginning on March 15, indicated that magma may have begun moving below the volcano.[8] On March 20, at 3:45?p.m. Pacific Standard Time (all times will be in PST or PDT), a shallow magnitude 4.2 earthquake (the initial reading was 4.1), centered below the volcano's north flank,[8] signaled the volcano's violent return from 123?years of hibernation.[9] A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels in the next two days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale.[10] A total of 174 shocks of magnitude?2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days.[11]\\r\\nShocks of magnitude?3.2 or greater occurred at a slightly increasing rate during April and May with five earthquakes of magnitude?4 or above per day in early April, and eight?per?day the week before May 18.[9] Initially there was no direct sign of eruption, but small earthquake-induced avalanches of snow and ice were reported from aerial observations.\\r\\nAt 12:36?p.m. on March 27, phreatic eruptions (explosions of steam caused by magma suddenly heating groundwater) ejected and smashed rock from within the old summit crater, excavating a new crater 250 feet (75?m) wide[9] and sending an ash column about 7,000 feet (2,100?m) into the air.[11] By this date a 16,000-foot-long (4,900?m) eastward-trending fracture system had also developed across the summit area.[12] This was followed by more earthquake swarms and a series of steam explosions that sent ash 10,000 to 11,000 feet (3,000 to 3,400?m) above their vent.[9] Most of this ash fell between 3 and 12 miles (5 and 19?km) from its vent, but some was carried 150 miles (240?km) south to Bend, Oregon, or 285 miles (459?km) east to Spokane, Washington.[13]\\r\\nA second, new crater and a blue flame were observed on March 29.[13][14] The flame was visibly emitted from both craters and was probably created by burning gases. Static electricity generated from ash clouds rolling down the volcano sent out lightning bolts that were up to 2 miles (3?km) long.[13] Ninety-three separate outbursts were reported on March 30,[13] and increasingly strong harmonic tremors were first detected on April 1, alarming geologists and prompting Governor Dixy Lee Ray to declare a state of emergency on April 3.[14] Governor Ray issued an executive order on April 30 creating a \\"red zone\\" around the volcano; anyone caught in this zone without a pass faced a $500 fine or six months in jail.[15] This precluded many cabin owners from visiting their property.\\r\\nBy April 7 the combined crater was 1,700 feet long by 1,200?ft wide and 500?ft deep (520G370G150?m).[16] A USGS team determined in the last week of April that a 1.5-mile-diameter (2.4?km) section of St. Helens' north face was displaced outward by at least 270 feet (82?m).[12] For the rest of April and early May this bulge grew by 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8?m) per day, and by mid-May it extended more than 400 feet (120?m) north.[12] As the bulge moved northward, the summit area behind it progressively sank, forming a complex, down-dropped block called a graben. Geologists announced on April 30 that sliding of the bulge area was the greatest immediate danger and that such a landslide might spark an eruption. These changes in the volcano's shape were related to the overall deformation that increased the volume of the volcano by 0.03 cubic miles (0.13?km3) by mid-May.[17] This volume increase presumably corresponded to the volume of magma that pushed into the volcano and deformed its surface. Because the intruded magma remained below ground and was not directly visible, it was called a cryptodome, in contrast to a true lava dome exposed at the surface.\\r\\nOn May 7, eruptions similar to those in March and April resumed, and over the next days the bulge approached its maximum size.[18] All activity had been confined to the 350-year-old summit dome and did not involve any new magma. A total of about 10,000 earthquakes were recorded prior to the May 18 event, with most concentrated in a small zone less than 1.6 miles (2.6?km) directly below the bulge.[17] Visible eruptions ceased on May 16, reducing public interest and consequently the number of spectators in the area.[19] Mounting public pressure then forced officials to allow 50 carloads of property owners to enter the danger zone on May 17 to gather whatever property they could carry.[19] Another trip was scheduled for 10?a.m. the next day.[19] Because that next day was Sunday, more than 300 loggers would not be working in the area. By the time of the climactic eruption, dacite magma intruding into the volcano had forced the north flank outward nearly 500 feet (150?m) and heated the volcano's groundwater system, causing many steam-driven explosions (phreatic eruptions).\\r\\nAs May 18 dawned, Mount St. Helens' activity did not show any change from the pattern of the preceding month. The rate of bulge movement, sulfur dioxide emission, and ground temperature readings did not reveal any changes indicating a catastrophic eruption. USGS volcanologist David A. Johnston was on duty at an observation post approximately 6 miles (10?km) north of the volcano: as of 6?a.m., Johnston's measurements did not indicate any unusual activity.[6]\\r\\nSuddenly, at 8:32?a.m., a magnitude?5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope triggered that part of the volcano to slide,[20] approximately 7ÿ20?seconds (about 10?seconds seems most reasonable) after the shock.[6] The landslide, the largest in recorded history, travelled at 110 to 155 miles per hour (177 to 249?km/h) and moved across Spirit Lake's west arm. Part of it hit a 1,150-foot-high (350?m) ridge about 6 miles (10?km) north.[6] Some of the slide spilled over the ridge, but most of it moved 13 miles (21?km) down the North Fork Toutle River, filling its valley up to 600 feet (180?m) deep with avalanche debris.[20] An area of about 24 square miles (62?km2) was covered, and the total volume of the deposit was about 0.7 cubic miles (2.9?km3).[6]\\r\\nScientists were able to reconstruct the motion of the landslide from a series of rapid photographs by Gary Rosenquist, who was camping 11 miles (18?km) away from the blast.[6] Rosenquist, his party and his photographs survived because the blast was deflected by local topography 1 mile (1.6?km) short of his location.[21]\\r\\nMost of St. Helens' former north side became a rubble deposit 17 miles (27?km) long, averaging 150 feet (46?m) thick; the slide was thickest at 1 mile (1.6?km) below Spirit Lake and thinnest at its western margin.[6] Thousands of trees were torn from the surrounding hillside after the lake was sloshed 800 feet (240?m) up the hillside. All the water in Spirit Lake was temporarily displaced by the landslide, sending 600-foot-high (180?m) waves crashing into a ridge north of the lake,[22] adding 295 feet (90?m) of new avalanche debris above the old lakebed, and raising its surface level by about 200 feet.[6] As the water moved back into its basin, it pulled with it thousands of trees felled by a super-heated wall of volcanic gas and searing ash and rock that had overtaken the landslide seconds before. Three decades after the eruption, mats of floating or stranded trees on the nearby Spirit Lake, St. Helens Lake, and Coldwater Lake remained.\\r\\nThe landslide exposed the dacite magma in St. Helens' neck to much lower pressure, causing the gas-charged, partially molten rock and high-pressure steam above it to explode a few seconds after the landslide started. Explosions burst through the trailing part of the landslide, blasting rock debris northward. The resulting blast laterally directed the pyroclastic flow of very hot volcanic gases, ash and pumice formed from new lava, while the pulverized old rock hugged the ground, initially moving at 220 miles per hour (350?km/h) but quickly accelerating to 670?mph (1,080?km/h), and it might have briefly passed the speed of sound.[6][20]\\r\\nPyroclastic flow material passed over the moving avalanche and spread outward, devastating a fan-shaped area 23 miles across by 19 miles long (37?km?G 31?km).[20] In total about 230 square miles (600?km2) of forest was knocked down,[20] and extreme heat killed trees miles beyond the blow-down zone. At its vent the lateral blast probably did not last longer than about 30?seconds, but the northward-radiating and expanding blast cloud have continued for about another minute.\\r\\nSuperheated flow material flashed water in Spirit Lake and North Fork Toutle River to steam, creating a larger, secondary explosion that was heard as far away as British Columbia,[23] Montana, Idaho, and Northern California. Yet many areas closer to the eruption (Portland, Oregon, for example) did not hear the blast. This so-called \\"quiet zone\\" extended radially a few tens of miles from the volcano and was created by the complex response of the eruption's sound waves to differences in temperature and air motion of the atmospheric layers and, to a lesser extent, local topography.[6]\\r\\nLater studies indicated that one-third of the 0.045 cubic miles (0.19?km3) of material in the flow was new lava, and the rest was fragmented, older rock.[23]\\r\\nEveryone in the quiet zone could see the huge ash cloud that was sent skyward from St. Helens' northern foot. The near-supersonic lateral blast, loaded with volcanic debris, caused devastation as far as 19 miles (31?km) from the volcano. The area affected by the blast can be subdivided into three roughly concentric zones:[6]\\r\\nBy the time this pyroclastic flow hit its first human victims, it was still as hot as 360?C (680?F) and filled with suffocating gas and flying angular material.[23] Most of the 57 people known to have died in that day's eruption succumbed to asphyxiation while several died from burns.[6] Lodge owner Harry R. Truman was buried under hundreds of feet of avalanche material. Volcanologist David A. Johnston was one of those killed, as was Reid Blackburn, a National Geographic photographer. Robert Landsburg, another photographer, was killed by the ash cloud. He was able to protect his film with his body, and the surviving photos provided geologists with valuable documentation of the historic eruption.[24]\\r\\nSubsequent outpourings of pyroclastic material from the breach left by the landslide consisted mainly of new magmatic debris rather than fragments of preexisting volcanic rocks. The resulting deposits formed a fan-like pattern of overlapping sheets, tongues and lobes. At least 17 separate pyroclastic flows occurred during the May 18 eruption, and their aggregate volume was about 0.05 cubic miles (210,000,000?m3).[6]\\r\\nThe flow deposits were still at about 300 to 420?C (572 to 788?F) two weeks after they erupted.[6] Secondary steam-blast eruptions fed by this heat created pits on the northern margin of the pyroclastic-flow deposits, at the south shore of Spirit Lake, and along the upper part of the North Fork Toutle River. These steam-blast explosions continued sporadically for weeks or months after the emplacement of pyroclastic flows, and at least one occurred a year later, on May 16, 1981.[6]\\r\\nAs the avalanche and initial pyroclastic flow were still advancing, a huge ash column grew to a height of 12 miles (19?km) above the expanding crater in less than 10?minutes and spread tephra into the stratosphere for 10 straight hours.[23] Near the volcano, the swirling ash particles in the atmosphere generated lightning, which in turn started many forest fires. During this time, parts of the mushroom-shaped ash-cloud column collapsed, and fell back upon the earth. This fallout, mixed with magma, mud and steam, sent additional pyroclastic flows speeding down St. Helens' flanks. Later, slower flows came directly from the new north-facing crater and consisted of glowing pumice bombs and very hot pumiceous ash. Some of these hot flows covered ice or water which flashed to steam, creating craters up to 65 feet (20?m) in diameter and sending ash as much as 6,500 feet (2,000?m) into the air.[25]\\r\\nStrong high-altitude wind carried much of this material east-northeasterly from the volcano at an average speed of about 60 miles per hour (97?km/h). By 9:45?a.m. it had reached Yakima, Washington, 90 miles (140?km) away, and by 11:45?a.m. it was over Spokane, Washington.[6] A total of 4 to 5 inches (100 to 130?mm) of ash fell on Yakima, and areas as far east as Spokane were plunged into darkness by noon where visibility was reduced to 10 feet (3.0?m) and 0.5 inches (13?mm) of ash fell.[23] Continuing eastward, St. Helens' ash fell in the western part of Yellowstone National Park by 10:15?p.m. and was seen on the ground in Denver, Colorado, the next day.[23] In time, ash fall from this eruption was reported as far away as Minnesota and Oklahoma, and some of the ash drifted around the globe within about 2?weeks.\\r\\nDuring the nine hours of vigorous eruptive activity, about 540,000,000 tons of ash fell over an area of more than 22,000 square miles (57,000?km2).[6] The total volume of the ash before its compaction by rainfall was about 0.3 cubic miles (1.3?km3).[6] The volume of the uncompacted ash is equivalent to about 0.05 cubic miles (210,000,000?m3) of solid rock, or about 7% of the amount of material that slid off in the debris avalanche.[6] By around 5:30?p.m. on May 18, the vertical ash column declined in stature, but less severe outbursts continued through the next several days.[26]\\r\\nGenerally, given that the way airborne ash is deposited after an eruption is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions, a certain variation of the ash type will occur, as a function of distance to the volcano or time elapsed from eruption. The ash from Mount St. Helens is no exception, and hence the ash properties have large variations.[27]\\r\\nThe bulk chemical composition of the ash has been found to be approximately 65% silicon dioxide, 18% aluminium oxide, 5% ferric oxide, 4% each calcium oxide and sodium oxide and 2% magnesium oxide. Trace chemicals were also detected, their concentrations varying as shown: 0.05ÿ0.09% chlorine, 0.02ÿ0.03% fluorine, and 0.09ÿ0.3% sulphur.[27]\\r\\nThe index of refraction, a number used in physics to describe how light propagates through a particular substance, is an important property of volcanic ash. This number is complex having both real and imaginary parts, the real part indicating how light disperses and the imaginary part indicating how light is absorbed by the substance.\\r\\nIt is known that the silicate particles have a real index of refraction ranging between 1.5 and 1.6 for visible light. However, there is a spectrum of colors associated with samples of volcanic ash, from very light to dark gray. This makes for variations in the measured imaginary refractive index under visible light.[28]\\r\\nIn the case of Mount St. Helens, the ash settled in three main layers on the ground:[27]\\r\\nFor example, when comparing the imaginary part of the refractive index k of stratospheric ash from 15?km and 18?km from the volcano it has been discovered that they have similar values around 700?nm (around 0.009), while they differ significantly around 300?nm. Here, the 18?km (k was found to be around 0.009) sample was much more absorbent than the 15?km sample (k was found to be around 0.002).[28]\\r\\nThe hot, exploding material also broke apart and melted nearly all of the mountain's glaciers along with most of the overlying snow. As in many previous St. Helens' eruptions, this created huge lahars (volcanic mudflows) and muddy floods that affected three of the four stream drainage systems on the mountain,[25] and which started to move as early as 8:50?a.m.[22] Lahars travelled as fast as 90 miles per hour (140?km/h) while still high on the volcano but progressively slowed to about 3 miles per hour (4.8?km/h) on the flatter and wider parts of rivers.[6] Mudflows from the southern and eastern flanks had the consistency of wet concrete as they raced down Muddy River, Pine Creek and Smith Creek to their confluence at the Lewis River. Bridges were taken out at the mouth of Pine Creek and the head of Swift Reservoir, which rose 2.6 feet (0.79?m)[25] by noon to accommodate the nearly 18,000,000 cubic yards (14,000,000?m3) of additional water, mud and debris.[6]\\r\\nGlacier and snow melt mixed with tephra on the volcano's northeast slope to create much larger lahars. These mudflows traveled down the north and south forks of the Toutle River and joined at the confluence of the Toutle forks and the Cowlitz River near Castle Rock, Washington, at 1:00?p.m. Ninety minutes after the eruption, the first mudflow had moved 27 miles (43?km) upstream where observers at Weyerhaeuser's Camp Baker saw a 12-foot-high (4?m) wall of muddy water and debris pass.[22] Near the confluence of the Toutle's north and south forks at Silver Lake, a record flood stage of 23.5 feet (7.2?m) was recorded.[22]\\r\\nA large but slower-moving mudflow with a mortar-like consistency was mobilized in early afternoon at the head of the Toutle River north fork. By 2:30?p.m. the massive mudflow had destroyed Camp Baker,[22] and in the following hours seven bridges were carried away. Part of the flow backed up for 2.5 miles (4.0?km) soon after entering the Cowlitz River, but most continued downstream. After traveling 17 miles (27?km) further, an estimated 3,900,000 cubic yards (3,000,000?m3) of material were injected into the Columbia River, reducing the river's depth by 25 feet (8?m) for a 4-mile (6?km) stretch.[22] The resulting 13-foot (4.0?m) river depth temporarily closed the busy channel to ocean-going freighters, costing Portland, Oregon, an estimated five million US dollars.[26] Ultimately more than 65?million cubic yards (50?million cubic metres) of sediment were dumped along the lower Cowlitz and Columbia Rivers.[6]\\r\\nThe May 18, 1980, event was the most deadly and economically destructive volcanic eruption in the history of the United States.[6] Approximately fifty-seven people were killed directly from the blast and 200 houses, 47 bridges, 15 miles (24?km) of railways and 185 miles (298?km) of highway were destroyed; two people were killed indirectly in accidents that resulted from poor visibility, and two more suffered fatal heart attacks from shoveling ash.[29] U.S. President Jimmy Carter surveyed the damage and said it looked more desolate than a moonscape.[30][31] A film crew was dropped by helicopter on Mount St. Helens on May 23 to document the destruction. However, their compasses spun in circles and they quickly became lost.[32] A second eruption occurred the next day (see below), but the crew survived and were rescued two days after that. The eruption ejected more than 1 cubic mile (4.2?km3) of material.[33] A quarter of that volume was fresh lava in the form of ash, pumice and volcanic bombs while the rest was fragmented, older rock.[33] The removal of the north side of the mountain (13% of the cone's volume) reduced Mount St. Helens' height by about 1,280 feet (390?m) and left a crater 1 to 2 miles (2 to 3?km) wide and 2,100 feet (640?m) deep with its north end open in a huge breach.[33]\\r\\nMore than 4,000,000,000 board feet (9,400,000?m3) of timber was damaged or destroyed, mainly by the lateral blast.[6] At least 25% of the destroyed timber was salvaged after September 1980. Downwind of the volcano, in areas of thick ash accumulation, many agricultural crops, such as wheat, apples, potatoes and alfalfa, were destroyed. As many as 1,500 elk and 5,000 deer were killed, and an estimated 12 million[6] Chinook and Coho salmon fingerlings died when their hatcheries were destroyed. Another estimated 40,000 young salmon were lost when they swam through turbine blades of hydroelectric generators after reservoir levels were lowered along the Lewis River to accommodate possible mudflows and flood waters.[6]\\r\\nIn total Mount St. Helens released 24 megatons of thermal energy, 7 of which were a direct result of the blast. This is equivalent to 1,600 times the size of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.[34]\\r\\nThere is a minor controversy in regards to the exact death toll. The figure most commonly cited is fifty-seven. However, there are two points of dispute.\\r\\nThe first point regards two officially listed victims, Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer. They were reported missing after the explosion. In the aftermath, investigators were able to locate individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well. However, they were unable to determine who reported Hiatt missing, and the person who was listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she wasn't the one who had done so. Since the investigators could not thus verify that they were the same Hiatt and Thayer who were reported missing, the names remain listed among the presumed dead.[35][36]\\r\\nThe second point regards three missing people who are not officially listed as victims: Robert Ruffle, Steven Whitsett and Mark Melanson. Cowlitz County Emergency Services Management lists them as \\"Possibly Missing  Not on [the official] List\\". According to Melanson's brother, in October 1983, Cowlitz County officials told his family that Melanson \\"is believed [...] a victim of the May 18, 1980, eruption\\" and that after years of searching, the family eventually decided \\"he's buried in the ash\\".[36]\\r\\nTaking these two points of dispute into consideration, the direct death toll could be as low as fifty-five or as high as sixty. When combined with the four indirect victims mentioned earlier, those numbers range from fifty-nine to sixty-four.\\r\\nThe ash fall created some temporary major problems with transportation, sewage disposal, and water treatment systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane was closed for a week and a half.[6] Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures.[6] Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal-combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused short circuits in electrical transformers, which in turn caused power blackouts.\\r\\nRemoving and disposing of the ash was a monumental task for some Eastern Washington communities. State and federal agencies estimated that over 2,400,000 cubic yards (1,800,000?m3) of ash, equivalent to about 900,000 tons in weight, were removed from highways and airports in Washington.[6] The ash removal cost $2.2 million and took 10 weeks in Yakima.[6] The need to remove ash quickly from transport routes and civil works dictated the selection of some disposal sites. Some cities used old quarries and existing sanitary landfills; others created dump sites wherever expedient. To minimize wind reworking of ash dumps, the surfaces of some disposal sites were covered with topsoil and seeded with grass. In Portland, the mayor eventually threatened businesses with fines if they failed to remove the ash from their parking lots.[37]\\r\\nA refined estimate of $1.1?billion ($2.74 billion in 2007 dollars[38]) was determined in a study by the International Trade Commission at the request of the United States Congress.[6] A supplemental appropriation of $951?million for disaster relief was voted by Congress, of which the largest share went to the Small Business Administration, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.[6]\\r\\nThere were also indirect and intangible costs of the eruption. Unemployment in the immediate region of Mount St. Helens rose tenfold in the weeks immediately following the eruption, and then returned to near-normal levels once timber-salvaging and ash-cleanup operations were underway. Only a small percentage of residents left the region because of lost jobs owing to the eruption.[6] Several months after May 18, a few residents reported suffering stress and emotional problems, even though they had coped successfully during the crisis. Counties in the region requested funding for mental health programs to assist such people.[6]\\r\\nInitial public reaction to the May 18 eruption dealt a nearly crippling blow to tourism, an important industry in Washington. Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. HelensÿGifford Pinchot National Forest area, but conventions, meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring Oregon not affected by the eruption. The adverse effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained its appeal for tourists. The United States Forest Service and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano's devastation.[6]\\r\\nSt. Helens produced an additional five explosive eruptions between May and October 1980. Through early 1990 at least 21 periods of eruptive activity had occurred. The volcano remains active, with smaller, dome-building eruptions continuing into 2008.\\r\\nAn eruption occurred on May 25, 1980, at 2:30?a.m. that sent an ash column 9 miles (14?km) into the atmosphere.[33] The eruption was preceded by a sudden increase in earthquake activity and occurred during a rainstorm. Erratic wind from the storm carried ash from the eruption to the south and west, lightly dusting large parts of western Washington and Oregon. Pyroclastic flows exited the northern breach and covered avalanche debris, lahars and other pyroclastic flows deposited by the May 18 eruption.[33]\\r\\nAt 7:05?p.m. on June 12, a plume of ash billowed 2.5 miles (4.0?km) above the volcano. At 9:09?p.m. a much stronger explosion sent an ash column about 10 miles (16?km) skyward.[39] This event caused the Portland area, previously spared by wind direction, to be thinly coated with ash in the middle of the annual Rose Festival.[40] A dacite dome then oozed into existence on the crater floor, growing to a height of 200 feet (61?m) and a width of 1,200 feet (370?m) within a week.[39]\\r\\nA series of large explosions on July 22 broke more than a month of relative quiet. The July eruptive episode was preceded by several days of measurable expansion of the summit area, heightened earthquake activity, and changed emission rates of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. The first hit at 5:14?p.m. as an ash column shot 10 miles (16?km) and was followed by a faster blast at 6:25?p.m. that pushed the ash column above its previous maximum height in just 7.5?minutes.[39] The final explosion started at 7:01?p.m. and continued for over two hours.[39] When the relatively small amount of ash settled over eastern Washington, the dome built in June was gone.[41]\\r\\nSeismic activity and gas emission steadily increased in early August, and on August 7 at 4:26?p.m., an ash cloud slowly expanded 8 miles (13?km) into the sky.[41] Small pyroclastic flows came through the northern breach and a weaker outpouring of ash rose from the crater. This continued until 10:32?p.m. when a second large blast sent ash high into the air, proceeding due north.[41] A second dacite dome filled this vent a few days later.\\r\\nTwo months of repose were ended by an eruption lasting from October 16 to 18. This event obliterated the second dome, sent ash 10 miles (16?km) in the air and created small, red-hot pyroclastic flows.[41] A third dome began to form within 30?minutes after the final explosion on October 18, and within a few days, it was about 900 feet (270?m) wide and 130 feet (40?m) high. In spite of the dome growth next to it, a new glacier formed rapidly inside the crater.\\r\\nAll of the post-1980 eruptions were quiet dome-building events, beginning with the December 27, 1980, to January 3, 1981, episode. By 1987 the third dome had grown to be more than 3,000 feet (910?m) wide and 800 feet (240?m) high.[41]\\r\\nFurther eruptions occurred over a few months between 1989 and 1991.\\r\\nThe 2004ÿ08 volcanic activity of Mount St. Helens has been documented as a continuous eruption with a gradual extrusion of magma at the Mount St. Helens volcano. Starting in October 2004 there was a gradual building of a new lava dome. The new dome did not rise above the caldera created by the 1980 eruption. This activity lasted until January 2008.\\r\\nMay 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens\\r\\n?This article incorporates public domain material?from the?United States Geological Survey document:?\\"Eruptions of Mount St. Helens: Past, Present, and Future\\".

They are the oldest examples of artificially mummified human remains, having been buried up to two thousand years before the Egyptian mummies. While the earliest mummy that has been found in Egypt dated around 3000 BC,[1] the oldest anthropogenically modified Chinchorro mummy dates from around 5050 BC.\\r\\nThe oldest naturally mummified mummy recovered from the Atacama Desert is dated around 7020 BC.[2]\\r\\nShell midden and bone chemistry suggest that 90% of the people's diet was seafood. Many ancient cultures of fisherfolk existed, tucked away in the arid river valleys of the Andes, but the Chinchorro made themselves unique by their dedicated preservation of the dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile many cultures throughout the world have sought to focus on preserving the dead elite, the Chinchorro tradition performed mummification on all members of their society, making them archaeologically significant. The decision of egalitarian preservation is proven in the mummification of the relatively less productive members of society (meaning those who could not contribute to the welfare of others; the elderly, children, infants and miscarried fetuses). It is often the case that children and babies received the most elaborate mummification treatments.[3][4]\\r\\n29% of the Chinchorro mummies found thus far were results of the natural mummification process. The earliest such mummy dates to 7020 BC, and is known as 'Acha man'.[5]\\r\\nThe artificial mummies of Chinchorro are believed to have first appeared around 5000 BC and reached a peak around 3000 BC. Often Chinchorro mummies were elaborately prepared by removing the internal organs and replacing them with vegetable fibers or animal hair. In some cases an embalmer would remove the skin and flesh from the dead body and replace them with clay. Radiocarbon dating reveals that the oldest discovered anthropogenically modified Chinchorro mummy was that of a child from a site in the Camarones Valley, about 60 miles (97?km) south of Arica in Chile and dates from around 5050 BC. The mummies continued to be made until about 1800 BC, making them contemporary with Las Vegas culture and Valdivia culture in Ecuador and the Norte Chico civilization in Peru.\\r\\nSince 1914, when Max Uhle began his work in Arica, an estimated 282 mummies have been found by archaeologists.[2] Morro-I, at the base of the Morro de Arica, revealed 96 bodies at the unstratified (i.e., there are no discernible layers of stratigraphy, hindering relative dating techniques), mostly loose sand at the slope of the hill. Fifty-four adults were found: 27 female, 20 male and 7 of indeterminate sex; 42 children were also found: 7 female, 12 male, 23 indeterminate.[4] This sample size suggests that the Chinchorro did not favor mummifying one sex over others.\\r\\nThe mummies may have served as a means of assisting the soul in surviving, and to prevent the bodies from frightening the living.[6] A more commonly accepted theory is that there was an ancestor cult of sorts,[7] since there is evidence of both the bodies traveling with the groups and placed in positions of honor during major rituals and a delay in the final burial itself.[8] Also, the bodies (which were always found in the extended position) were elaborately decorated and colored (even later repainted), and are thought to be reinforced and stiffened in order to be carried on reed litters and consequently displayed.[3] However, since the society is a preceramic one, as well as slightly nomadic, it is somewhat difficult to determine through archaeological records the reasons why the Chinchorro felt the need to mummify the dead.\\r\\nThe representatives of the Chinchorro culture was determined by mitochondrial haplogroup A2.[9]\\r\\nDr. Bernardo Arriaza is a Chilean physical anthropologist who contributed a lot of the knowledge about Chinchorro mummification. Starting in 1984, he published numerous studies on the subject. In 1994, Arriaza created a classification of the Chinchorro mummies that is widely used.[10] His book \\"Beyond Death: The Chinchorro Mummies of Ancient Chile[11]\\" was published by the Smithsonian and also translated into Spanish.\\r\\nWhile the overall manner in which the Chinchorro mummified their dead changed over the years, several traits remained constant throughout their history. In excavated mummies, archaeologists found skin and all soft tissues and organs, including the brain, removed from the corpse. After the soft tissues had been removed, sticks reinforced bones while the skin was stuffed with vegetable matter before reassembling the corpse. The mummy received a clay mask even if the mummy was already completely covered in dried clay; a process which the body was wrapped in reeds left to dry out for 30 to 40 days.\\r\\nUhle categorized the types of mummification he saw into three categories: simple treatment, complex treatment, and mud-coated mummies. He believed that these occurred chronologically, the mummification process becoming more complex as time went on.[2] Since then, archaeologists have expanded upon this explanation and have (for the most part) agreed upon the following types of mummification: natural, black, red, mud-coated and bandage mummies.[2][12] Mummification can also be described as externally prepared mummies, internally prepared mummies (Egyptian Pharos), and reconstructed mummies (the Chinchorro), according to Andean Archaeologists.[7] Further, it turns out that the types of mummification used overlap with each other, and mummies of different types have been found all in the same tomb.[3] The two most common techniques used in Chinchorro mummification were the Black mummies and the Red mummies.\\r\\nOf the 282 Chinchorro mummies found thus far, 29% of them were results of the natural mummification process (7020 BC-1300 BC).[2] In northern Chile, environmental conditions greatly favor natural mummification. The soil is very rich in nitrates which, when combined with other factors such as the aridity of the Atacama Desert, ensure organic preservation. Salts halt bacterial growth; the hot, dry conditions facilitate rapid desiccation, evaporating all bodily fluids of the corpses. Soft tissues, as a result, dry before they decay and a naturally preserved mummy is left.[7] What must also be noted is that even though the Chinchorro people did not mummify the bodies artificially, the bodies were still buried wrapped in reeds with grave goods.[2]\\r\\nThe black mummy technique (5000 to 3000 BC) involved taking the dead person's body apart, treating it, and reassembling it. The head, arms, and legs were removed from the trunk; the skin was often removed, too. The body was heat-dried, and the flesh and tissue were completely stripped from the bone by using stone tools. Evidence exists that the bones were dried by hot ashes or coal. After reassembly, the body was then covered with a white ash paste, filling the gaps with grass, ashes, soil, animal hair and more. The paste was also used to fill out the person's normal facial features. The person's skin (including facial skin with a wig attachment of short black human hair) was refitted on the body, sometimes in smaller pieces, sometimes in one almost-whole piece. Sea lion skin was sometimes used as well. Then the skin (or, in the case of children, who were often missing their skin layer, the white ash layer) was painted with black manganese giving their color.[2]\\r\\nThe red mummy technique (2500 BC to 2000 BC) was a technique in which rather than disassemble the body, many incisions were made in the trunk and shoulders to remove internal organs and dry the body cavity. The head was cut from the body so that the brain could be removed, after which the skin would be pasted back on, which would often just be covered with a clay mask. The body was packed with various materials to return it to somewhat more-normal dimensions, sticks used to strengthen it, and the incisions sewn up using reed cord. The head was placed back on the body, this time with a wig made from tassels of human hair up to 60?cm long. A \\"hat\\" made out of black clay held the wig in place. Except for the wig and often the (black) face, everything was then painted with red ochre.[2]\\r\\nThe final style of Chinchorro mummification was the mud-coat (3000-1300 BC). Ecologically speaking, at the time of the Chinchorro culture the region was relatively stable. It has been suggested by environmentalists that the incredible preservation of these mummies is also influenced by the pedogenic (the evolution of soil) creation of clays and gypsum, which act as cementing agents, and the latter as a natural desiccant. The malleable clay allowed for the morticians to mold and create the colorful appearances of mummies, with the added bonus of the fact that the foul smell of the desiccating mummy would be covered.[12] Artisans no longer removed the organs of the dead; instead a thick coat of mud, sand and a binder like egg or fish glue was used to cover the bodies. Once completed the mummies were cemented into their graves. The change in style may have come from exposure to outsiders and their different cultures, or from the association of disease with the rotting corpses.\\r\\nThe bandage technique (guessed to be 2620-2000 BC, but there is a lack of radiocarbon dating) has only been found to be present in three infants. The technique is a mixture of black and red mummies, in that the body was taken apart and reinforced in the style of black mummies but the head was treated in the same way as red mummies are. Animal and human skin was used to wrap the body in the place of clay. Further, the bodies were found to be painted with red ocher while the heads were painted with black manganese.[2]\\r\\nAt least one Chinchorro mummy bears remarkable witness to the antiquity of tattooing in the region. Indeed, the remains of a male with a mustache-like dotted line tattooed above his upper lip and dating to 1880 +/- 100 BC (2563ÿ1972 cal BC) is believed to represent the oldest direct evidence of tattooing in the Americas and the fourth-oldest such evidence in the world.[13][14]","input":"When did cultures in peru begin the practice of mummification?"},{"output":"when one-day matches began being played at night under floodlights","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nA cricket ball is a hard, solid ball used to play cricket. A cricket ball consists of cork covered by leather, and manufacture is regulated by cricket law at first-class level. The manipulation of a cricket ball, through employment of its various physical properties, is a staple component of bowling and dismissing batsmen. Movement in the air, and off the ground, is influenced by the condition of the ball, the efforts of the bowler and the pitch, while working on the cricket ball to obtain optimum condition is a key role of the fielding side. The cricket ball is the principal manner through which the batsman scores runs, by manipulating the ball into a position where it would be safe to take a run, or by directing the ball through or over the boundary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn day Test cricket, professional domestic games that spread over a multitude of days, and almost the entirety of amateur cricket, the traditional red cricket ball is normally used. In many one day cricket matches, a white ball is used instead in order to remain visible under floodlights, and since 2010, pink has been introduced to contrast with players' white clothing and for improved night visibility during day/night Test matches.[1] Training balls of white, red and pink are also common, and tennis balls and other similar-sized balls can be used for training or informal cricket matches. During cricket matches, the quality of the ball changes to a point where it is no longer usable, and during this decline its properties alter and thus can influence the match. Altering the state of the cricket ball outside the permitted manners designated in the rules of cricket is prohibited during a match, and so-called \\"ball tampering\\" has resulted in numerous controversies.\\r\\n\\r\\nInjuries and fatalities have been caused by cricket balls during matches.[2] The hazards posed by cricket balls were a key motivator for the introduction of protective equipment. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish Standard BS 5993 specifies the construction details, dimensions, quality and performance of cricket balls.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cricket ball is made with a core of cork, which is layered with tightly wound string, and covered by a leather case with a slightly raised sewn seam. In a top-quality ball suitable for the highest levels of competition, the covering is constructed of four pieces of leather shaped similar to the peel of a quartered orange, but one hemisphere is rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the other. The \\"equator\\" of the ball is stitched with string to form the ball's prominent seam, with six rows of stitches. The remaining two joins between the leather pieces are stitched internally forming the quarter seam. Lower-quality balls with a two-piece covering are also popular for practice and lower-level competition due to their lower cost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nature of the cricket ball slightly varies with its manufacturer. White Kookaburra balls are used in one-day  and Twenty20 international matches, while red Kookaburras are used in test matches played in most of the ten test-playing nations,[4] except for the West Indies and England, who use Dukes, and India, who use SG balls.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nCricket balls are traditionally red, and red balls are used in Test cricket and First-class cricket.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite balls were introduced when one-day matches began being played at night under floodlights, as they are more visible at night; all professional one-day matches are now played with white balls, even when they are not played at night. The white balls have been found to behave differently to the red balls, most notably that they swing a lot more during the first half of an innings than the red ball, and that they deteriorate more quickly. Manufacturers claim that white and red balls are manufactured using the same methods and materials,[1] other than the dying treatment of the leather. Another problem associated with white cricket balls used in One Day Internationals is that they quickly become dirty or dull in colour, which makes it more difficult for batsmen to sight the ball after 30-40 overs of use.[6][7] Since October 2012, this has been managed by the use of two new white balls in each innings, with a different ball used from each bowling end; the same strategy was used in the 1992 and 1996 Cricket World Cups. Between October 2007 and October 2012, the issue had been managed using one new ball from the start of the innings, then swapping it at the end of the 34th over with a \\"reconditioned ball\\", which was neither new nor too dirty to see. Before October 2007, except during 1992 and 1996 World Cups, only one ball was used during an innings of an ODI and it was the umpires discretion to change the ball if it was difficult to see.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nPink balls were developed in the 2000s to enable Tests and first-class matches played at night. The red ball is unsuited to night tests due to poor visibility, and the white ball is unsuited to first-class cricket because its rapid deterioration makes it unable to be used for eighty overs as specified in the rules, so the pink ball was designed to provide a satisfactory compromise on both issues. It is still considered more difficult to see than a white ball; and the leather is more heavily dyed than in a red ball, which better preserves its colour and visibility as it wears but also gives it slightly different wear characteristics. It has performed well enough in testing and first-class cricket to be approved for use in international cricket.[9] A pink ball was used for the first time in an international match in July 2009 when the England Woman's team defeated Australia in a one-day match at Wormsley,[10] and a pink ball was used in a day-night Test match for the first time in November 2015. Other colours were also experimented with, such as yellow and orange (glowing composite), for improved night visibility, but pink proved to be the preferred option.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2014, the ball used in Test match cricket in England has a recommended retail price of 100 pounds sterling.[11] In test match cricket this ball is used for a minimum of 80 overs (theoretically five hours and twenty minutes of play), after which the fielding side has the option of using a new ball. In professional one day cricket, at least two new balls are used for each match. Amateur cricketers often have to use old balls, or cheap substitutes, in which case the changes in the condition of the ball may not be experienced in the same manner as that which occurs during an innings of professional cricket.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three main manufacturers of cricket ball used in international matches: Kookaburra, Dukes and SG. The manufacturer of the red (or pink) balls used for Tests varies depending on location: India uses SG, England, Ireland and the West Indies use Dukes, and all other countries use Kookaburra. The different manufacturers' balls behave differently ÿ e.g. Dukes balls have a prouder seam and will tend to swing more than a Kookaburra ball[12] ÿ providing a home advantage when playing against a team unfamiliar with the ball. All limited overs international matches, regardless of location, are played with white Kookaburra balls.[13] White Dukes balls were used at the 1999 Cricket World Cup, but the ball behaved more erratically than the Kookaburra and has not since been used. Domestic competitions may use a domestic manufacturer: for example, Pakistan uses Grays balls in its first-class competitions.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nCricket balls can be bowled at close to 160?km/h (100?mph) by pace bowlers and made to deviate from a straight course, both in the air (known as 'swinging') and off the ground (known as 'seaming'). A spin bowler imparts lateral revolutions on the ball at the point of delivery, so that when it bounces it deviates from a straight course. As cricket bats have become thicker, the ball can now be hit well over 100 metres before touching the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nCricket commentator and former Test bowler Simon Doull noted that cricket balls produced after Cricket World Cup 2015 produced a lot less swing regardless of manufacturer. This was said to be apparent in 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, even in traditionally swing-friendly British pitches, particularly with white balls, but the former West-Indian bowler Ian Bishop was unwilling to support this.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn test cricket, a new ball is used at the start of each innings in a match. In Limited Over Internationals, two new balls, one from each end, are used at the start of each innings in a match.\\r\\nA cricket ball may not be replaced except under specific conditions described in the Laws of Cricket:\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause a single ball is used for an extended period of play, its surface wears down and becomes rough. The bowlers may polish it whenever they can - usually by rubbing it on their trousers, producing the characteristic red stain that can often be seen there. However, they will usually only polish one side of the ball, in order to create 'swing' as it travels through the air. They may apply saliva or sweat to the ball as they polish it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seam of a cricket ball can also be used to produce different trajectories through the air, with the technique known as swing bowling, or to produce sideways movement as it bounces off the pitch, with the technique known as seam bowling.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the condition of the cricket ball is crucial to the amount of movement through the air a bowler can produce, the laws governing what players may and may not do to the ball are specific and rigorously enforced. The umpires will inspect the ball frequently during a match. If the ball is out of shape due to normal wear and tear due to batting and ball hitting the pitch, a ball of similar usage rate and condition will be replaced (i.e. a ball of about 30-overs old will be replaced by a ball about the same 'age').\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is illegal for a player to:\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite these rules, it can be tempting for players to gain an advantage by breaking them. There have been a handful of incidents of so-called ball tampering at the highest levels of cricket.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new cricket ball is harder than a worn one, and is preferred by fast bowlers because of the speed and bounce of the ball off the pitch. Older balls tend to spin more as the roughness grips the pitch more when the ball bounces, so spin bowlers prefer to use a worn ball, though a ball of about 8-10 overs old is still useful to a spinner as it can get more drift in the air. Uneven wear on older balls may also make reverse swing possible.  A captain may delay the request for a new ball if he prefers to have his spin bowlers operating, but usually asks for the new ball soon after it becomes available.\\r\\n\\r\\nCricket balls are hard and potentially lethal, so most of today's batsmen and close fielders often wear protective equipment. Cricket ball injuries are fairly frequent, including eye (with some players having lost eyes),[17] head and face,[18] finger and toe,[19] teeth[20] and testicular injuries.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrederick, Prince of Wales (1707ÿ1751) is often said to have died of complications after being hit by a cricket ball, although the connection between the incident and his actual cause of death is unproven. Glamorgan player Roger Davis was almost killed by a ball in 1971 when he was hit on the head while fielding.[21] The Indian batsman Nariman 'Nari' Contractor had to retire from the game after being hit by a ball on the head in the West Indies in 1962.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, Indian cricketer Raman Lamba died when a cricket ball hit his head in a club match in Dhaka.[23] Lamba was fielding at forward short-leg without wearing a helmet when a ball struck by batsman Mehrab Hossain hit him hard on the head and rebounded to wicket-keeper Khaled Mashud.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cricket umpire, Alcwyn Jenkins, died in 2009 in Swansea, Wales after being hit on the head by a ball thrown by a fielder.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2014, Australia and South Australia batsman Phillip Hughes died at the age of 25 at a Sydney hospital after succumbing to an injury sustained from being hit on the side of the neck by a bouncer bowled by Sean Abbott during a Sheffield Shield game.[24] The same week, Hillel Oscar, an umpire and former captain of Israel's national cricket team died after being hit in the neck by a ball.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 14 August 2017, Zubair Ahmed died after being hit on the head while batting in a club match played in the Mardan District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes alternatives to a real cricket ball may be preferred for reasons of safety, availability and cost. Examples include a tennis ball and a plastic version of the cricket ball.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany casual players use a tennis ball wrapped in layers of some type of adhesive tape (often electrical tape), which makes the relatively soft tennis ball harder and smoother. This is commonly referred to as a tape ball. A common variant is to tape only half the tennis ball, to provide two different sides and make it easy to bowl with prodigious amounts of swing.","input":"When was the white ball first used in cricket?"},{"output":"Belkapi gram panchayat of Barkatha community development block in Barhi subdivision of Hazaribagh district in the Indian state of Jharkhand","context":"Surajkund hot spring(Hindi: ????????)

It premiered with \\"The Rickshank Rickdemption\\", which aired unannounced on April 1, 2017 as part of Adult Swim's annual April Fools' prank. As a result of delays during the writing process, the remaining episodes began airing weekly on July 30, 2017, almost two years since the premiere of the previous season. The third season comprised ten episodes, and its initial airing concluded on October 1, 2017.\\r\\nThe premiere picks up where the second-season finale left off, as the show continues to follow the adventures of the members of the Smith household. When Jerry asks Beth to choose between him and Rick, the strength of their marriage is tested. Jerry is confronted with the loss of his family, while Beth begins to discover her independence again. Morty and Summer deal with their parents' separation by seeking more control over their lives. Rick's nihilistic way of life continues to prevent him from bonding with his family, as he remains unable to change his self-destructive behavior.\\r\\nThe season received generally positive reviews, and many critics have highlighted its focus on character development. Furthermore, Rick and Morty delivered the highest ratings in Adult Swim's history and was the top-rated comedy among millennials on television. The season has also received a number of awards and nominations, including a Critics' Choice Award for Best Animated Series.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRick is interrogated via a mind-computer link, inside a galactic federal prison. Summer and Morty attempt to rescue him but they are captured by SEAL Team Ricks, who take them to the Citadel of Ricks and decide to assassinate Rick. Back at the prison, Rick tricks both the federal agents and his aspiring assassins by switching bodies with them. He then teleports the entire Citadel into the federal prison, prompting a massive battle. Amid the confusion, Rick rescues Morty and Summer, and uses the Galactic Federation's mainframe to make its currency worthless. The Federation falls into chaos and collapses as a result, with the aliens leaving Earth. Rick, Morty, and Summer return home where Jerry gives Beth an ultimatum to choose between him and Rick. Beth chooses Rick and they decide to get a divorce. After the new status quo is established, Rick reveals to Morty that his ulterior motive was to become his de facto male influence. This escalates into a nonsensical angry rant, centered around Rick's desire to find more of the discontinued McDonald's Szechuan sauce, a promotional product for the 1998 film Mulan.\\r\\nRick takes Morty and Summer to a post-apocalyptic version of Earth, where they are chased by a group of scavengers, known as Death Stalkers. Rick notices that the group is carrying a valuable rock of Isotope 322, so he and the kids join them in hope of stealing it. Summer falls in love with the Death Stalkers' leader, while Morty is given the strength of a giant arm, which takes him in search of its previous owner's killer. Rick leaves and replaces the kids with androids to fool Beth. When he returns, he helps the Death Stalkers use the Isotope to power a more advanced civilization. Summer does not like how the change softens the Death Stalkers, and she decides to follow Rick and Morty back home. Before leaving, Rick steals the isotope. The experience helps the kids overcome their parents' divorce. Summer reconciles with Jerry, and Morty realizes he must live his own life.\\r\\nRick turns himself into a pickle to get out of attending a school-sanctioned family therapy, but Beth takes Rick's serum which would revert the transformation. Left alone, Rick eventually rolls down into an open sewer drain, where he manages to manipulate the nervous systems of dead roaches and rats to build himself a mobile exoskeleton, with added weapons such as razors and drills. He unwittingly escapes into a foreign government agency. The guards try to kill Rick, under orders from the agency director, but Rick kills them all. In the process, Rick battles and ultimately befriends a prisoner named Jaguar. Rick changes his mind and decides to attend the therapy session, arriving towards the end. Dr. Wong gives her diagnosis, observing that Rick crafts relationships that punish emotions and vulnerability. On their way home, Rick apologizes to Beth for deceiving her and uses the serum to turn human again. Morty and Summer wish to continue seeing Dr. Wong, but Rick and Beth ignore them.\\r\\nAt Morty's insistence, Rick agrees to join the Vindicators, a group of intergalactic superheroes, to fight their archnemesis, Worldender. Rick cannot hide his disdain for the superheroes, while Morty is thrilled. The next morning, the Vindicators enter Worldender's base, only to find that, the previous night, Rick had killed him and set up a variety of puzzles that the Vindicators must solve to survive while he was blackout drunk. They start arguing and kill one another, while Morty solves all the puzzles, as he knows what Rick had in mind when he put them up. After all puzzles are solved, the only ones left alive are Rick, Morty, and Supernova, who is a member of the Vindicators. Supernova tries to kill Rick and Morty, but before she can do so, the three of them are transported to a party that Rick also set up while blackout drunk, where she gets away.\\r\\nTo bolster Jerry's self-esteem, Rick takes him on an adventure at Morty's request. They visit an otherworldly resort within an immortality field so Jerry won't be harmed while away. Jerry encounters Risotto Groupon, an alien who blames Rick for his kingdom being usurped. Risotto enlists Jerry in a plot to kill Rick, but Jerry backs out after Rick apologizes for ruining his marriage. Meanwhile, Summer deals with self-esteem issues as well. Her boyfriend, Ethan, leaves her for a larger-breasted girlfriend, and Summer attempts to enlarge her own breasts using one of Rick's devices. Her aim is off, and she grows to bizarre proportions. Morty wants to call Rick for assistance, but Beth refuses. Arrogantly trying to prove her own self-worth, Beth repeatedly fails to fix the problem and is tricked into releasing three tiny technical support workers that were trapped inside the machine. Once Morty figures out how the machine works, he restores Summer's size and spitefully uses it to deform Ethan in an act of vengeance.\\r\\nAfter a six-day outer space adventure that leaves them on the verge of psychological collapse, Rick and Morty decide to spend some time at an alien spa, where they use a machine that extracts a person's negative personality traits. However, without Rick and Morty knowing, those traits are transposed into toxic physical counterparts, characterized by Rick's arrogance and Morty's self-loathing. On the other hand, the true Rick becomes more considerate, and Morty's confidence soars, which allows him to start dating girls. Toxic Rick uses a moonlight tower to remake the whole Earth in his own image, but the true Rick reverts the situation by merging back with him. Morty avoids merging back with his toxic counterpart and goes on to live a life as a stockbroker in New York City. Rick tracks him down with the help of Jessica, Morty's classmate, and restores order by re-injecting the negative personality traits into him.\\r\\nAs Rick and Morty adventure to Atlantis, the episode shifts focus towards the Citadel, a secret society populated by numerous versions of Ricks and Mortys. There, a group of Mortys journey to a portal to have their wishes granted; a novice police officer Rick starts working with a veteran police Morty to take down drug dealers, and a worker Rick revolts at a wafer factory, where the key ingredient is extracted from a Rick hooked up to a machine to re-experience his best memories. Meanwhile, an election is held for the new president of the Citadel. Despite being the underdog, the Morty Party candidate manages to secure the presidency. When his campaign manager receives information that the new president is in fact Evil Morty from the first-season episode \\"Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind\\", he attempts to assassinate him but he fails. Evil Morty orders the execution of a shadow council of Ricks and anybody else he considers a potential threat to his rule.\\r\\nAfter Morty requests to have a traumatic memory deleted, Rick reveals a room where he has been storing a number of memories he has removed from Morty's mind. However, as it turns out, besides the memories that Morty did not want to keep from their adventures, the room also contains memories in which Rick was made to look foolish, so he had them forcibly removed from Morty. This revelation prompts a fight, during which Rick and Morty have their memories accidentally erased. Morty scours the memories to replace the ones he lost, but he is displeased with the truth he finds, and convinces Rick that they should kill themselves. Summer enters the room moments before they commit suicide. At this point, it is revealed that Rick has a contingency plan should this happen. Following written instructions, Summer tranquilizes Rick and Morty, restores their memories, and drags them to the living room. Rick and Morty wake up on the couch, believing that they slept through an entire \\"Interdimensional Cable\\" episode.\\r\\nRick and Beth enter Froopyland, a fantasy world created by Rick for young Beth. Their goal is to recover Tommy, Beth's childhood friend who has been trapped in Froopyland, and prevent the execution of his father, who is being falsely accused of eating him. Tommy, who has survived all these years by resorting to bestiality, incest and cannibalism, refuses to return to the real world. Rick and Beth manage to save his father's life by creating a clone of Tommy. Back at home, Beth is presented with the option of having a replacement clone of her created, so that she will be free to travel the world. Meanwhile, Jerry dates an alien hunter named Kiara, to Morty and Summer's dismay. When he decides to get out of the relationship, Kiara is enraged and tries to kill the kids, whom she holds responsible. The situation is resolved following the revelation that Kiara was using Jerry to get over her previous boyfriend, much like Jerry was doing with her.\\r\\nThe President calls on Rick and Morty to defeat a monster in the tunnels underneath the White House, which they do with little effort. Annoyed that he constantly calls on them without any gratitude, they go back home, with the President quickly finding out. The resulting argument leads to a battle of egos that culminates in a fight in the White House between Rick and the President's security. Meanwhile, fearing she might be a clone made by Rick, Beth reunites with Jerry to figure out the truth. Shortly after, the entire family gets together to hide from Rick, but he tracks them down. Rick eventually submits to Jerry once again being a family member. Rick ends his conflict with the President by pretending to be Fly Fishing Rick, a Rick from a different reality, and calling a truce. The episode ends with the family happy to be together again, except for Rick who is disappointed about losing his dominant position.\\r\\nThe actors and actresses listed below lend their voices to the corresponding animated characters.\\r\\nOther cast members of the season, who each have voiced one or more characters, include: Dan Harmon, Brandon Johnson, Tom Kenny, Maurice LaMarche, Nolan North, Cassie Steele, Kari Wahlgren, Laura Bailey, John DiMaggio, Ryan Ridley, Scott Chernoff, Dan Benson, Clancy Brown, Echo Kellum, Melique Berger, William Holmes, Tara Strong, Jeff B.

She explained that a story that for other shows would have been an entire episode, for Rick and Morty it will be only its first few minutes. Therefore, the team had to write a large amount of story in a short time.[24] Dan Harmon, talking about the writing process, said that the episodes were written collectively by the staff, and that the name of the writer that appears in the credits of an episode is usually that of the person who has been assigned to prepare the episode's outline.[25] Writing began on November 2, 2015,[26] and the first episode was recorded on February 18, 2016.[27]\\r\\nIn July 2016, already behind on schedule, the production team admitted that the success of the series had increased pressure to meet the expectations of the viewers. The creative freedom provided by Adult Swim entailed taking responsibility for product quality, and as the bar had risen higher, work had become harder, improvements were constantly being sought, and this often resulted in delays.[28] Writing was finally completed in November 2016.[29] In February 2017, Dan Harmon, answering questions regarding the delayed release, announced on his podcast, Harmontown, that the season was in the animation process, after a long period of writing.[30] When production of the season had been completed, Harmon wrote a series of posts on Twitter, explaining that the writing process took that long to complete, because of his perfectionism.[31] As a result, the third season of Rick and Morty consisted of only ten episodes instead of fourteen, as was initially intended.[32]\\r\\nFollowing the conclusion of the show's third season, Adult Swim made a livestream marathon of Rick and Morty available to watch on its official website in select regions, hoping to dissuade viewers from watching other illegal livestreams.[33] The season was released on DVD and Blu-ray on May 15, 2018, with special features including exclusive commentary and animatics for every episode, \\"inside the episode\\", the origins of Rick and Morty, and an exclusive \\"inside the recording booth\\" session.[34] Uncensored versions of the season are available to purchase on various digital platforms, including iTunes, Amazon and Microsoft Store.[35][36] The digital release also includes commentaries on every episode, as well as seven more short videos featuring co-creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland.[37] The season is available to watch on Netflix in a number of countries outside the United States, including the United Kingdom.[38]\\r\\nThe season currently holds a 97% approval rating from the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews, and a rating average of 8.76 out of 10.[39] Jesse Schedeen of IGN described the third season of the show as darker and more unpredictable than the first two, and praised its high-concept storytelling and character development. Schedeen gave the season an 8.8 out of 10 rating, saying that it \\"didn't quite reach the heights of Season 2, but it is the series' most consistently entertaining and ambitious season yet\\".[40] Holding a different view, Mike Cosimano of Comics Gaming Magazine disagreed with other critics about the third season being dark; he said that it used \\"cheap gut punches to elicit that very reaction\\". Cosimano also said that too many episodes of the season were weak and the character development is \\"front-loaded to the first half of the show,\\" resulting in an uneven season. He considered the season to be \\"a disappointment,\\" rating it 6.5 out of 10.[41]\\r\\nOn a thematic level, Kayla Cobb of Decider focused on the dynamism displayed by Beth and Summer, as the characters broke the stereotypical conventions of the first two seasons. Cobb stated that \\"Season 3 is the first time Rick and Morty really handed over the reigns [sic] to its leading ladies, and it was a horrifying delight.\\"[42] Julia Alexander of Polygon highlighted the philosophical conflict between nihilist realism and life in ignorant bliss as the season's main theme, and noted that \\"after an introspective season built on the importance of self-realization and reflection, Rick and Morty's third year ended on a total reset,\\" with Beth and the kids reuniting with Jerry in the season-finale, as they seek comfort through escapism and ignore the realities of their lives.[43] Once again, Rick becomes the outsider figure in the Smith household, with Beth noting that from this point \\"things will be like season one\\" again. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club, however, appeared skeptical about the character's statement, noting that \\"the problem with going as far as season three went is that bridges stay burned\\". Handlen considered Jerry's return to be an anticlimax from a character standpoint and \\"a necessary corrective to an arc that was in danger of going off the rails completely\\".[44]\\r\\nRick and Morty completed its third season with overall viewership numbers increased by 81% over the previous season,[45] and delivered the highest ratings in Adult Swim's history.[46] Rick and Morty was the most popular television comedy within the 18ÿ24 and 18ÿ34 age ranges in the United States, based on \\"Live+7\\" ratings data spanning from December 2016 to September 2017.[47] This rating system tracks live viewership plus streaming and on-demand viewing over an initial week-long period, and provides a more accurate picture of delayed viewing as compared to \\"Live+Same Day\\" ratings.[48] Considering that episodes of the third season originally aired at 11:30 p.m. on Sundays, it is very likely that people would have watched them on-demand the next day or several days later.[47]\\r\\nChristina Miller, the president of Adult Swim, told Fortune that Rick and Morty \\"goes beyond just appealing to millennials,\\" as numbers suggest that people of all ages are watching the show.[45] The second episode of the season, which aired nearly four months after the unannounced premiere, was the season's most-watched episode with 2.86 million viewers, and the second-best on cable for the day it aired in adults 18ÿ49, behind the weekly episode of Game of Thrones.[4] The season finale was watched by 2.6 million live plus same day viewers and it was the most-watched telecast across all age groups.[49]\\r\\nThe Szechuan sauce reference in the season premiere brought huge online attention for McDonald's discontinued promotional product.[50] Internet memes spread rapidly on Reddit and Twitter,[51] more than 40,000 people signed a petition at Change.org, asking for the return of the sauce,[52] while an eBay auction resulted in a 20-year-old packet of this teriyaki sauce being sold for $14,700.[53] On October 7, 2017, McDonald's served limited quantities of Szechuan sauce, with the company calling it \\"the years most talked-about dipping sauce.\\"[54]","input":"When was rick and morty season 3 released?"},{"output":"The Six Grandfathers","context":"Mount Rushmore National Memorial is a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore, a batholith in the Black Hills in Keystone, South Dakota, United States. Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture's design and oversaw the project's execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son, Lincoln Borglum.[2][3] Mount Rushmore features 60-foot (18?m) sculptures of the heads of four United States presidents: George Washington (1732ÿ1799), Thomas Jefferson (1743ÿ1826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858ÿ1919), and Abraham Lincoln (1809ÿ1865).[4] The memorial park covers 1,278.45 acres (2.00?sq?mi; 5.17?km2)[5] and is 5,725 feet (1,745?m) above sea level.[6]\\r\\nSouth Dakota historian Doane Robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of carving the likenesses of famous people into the Black Hills region of South Dakota in order to promote tourism in the region. Robinson's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles; however, Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from Native American groups. They settled on Mount Rushmore, which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure. Robinson wanted it to feature American West heroes like Lewis and Clark, Red Cloud,[7] and Buffalo Bill Cody,[8] but Borglum decided the sculpture should have broader appeal and chose the four presidents.\\r\\nAfter securing federal funding through the enthusiastic sponsorship of \\"Mount Rushmore's great political patron\\" U.S. Senator Peter Norbeck,[9] construction on the memorial began in 1927, and the presidents' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939. Upon Gutzon Borglum's death in March 1941, his son Lincoln Borglum took over as leader of the construction project. Each president was originally to be depicted from head to waist. Lack of funding forced construction to end in late October 1941.[10]\\r\\nMount Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of the United States, and it has appeared in works of fiction, as well as being discussed or depicted in other popular works. It attracts over two million visitors annually.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally known to the Lakota Sioux as \\"The Six Grandfathers\\",[11] the mountain was renamed after Charles E. Rushmore, a prominent New York lawyer, during an expedition in 1885.[12] At first, the project of carving Rushmore was undertaken to increase tourism in the Black Hills region of South Dakota. After long negotiations involving a Congressional delegation and President Calvin Coolidge, the project received Congressional approval. The carving started in 1927 and ended in 1941 with no fatalities.[13]\\r\\nAs Six Grandfathers, the mountain was part of the route that Lakota leader Black Elk took in a spiritual journey that culminated at Black Elk Peak. Following a series of military campaigns from 1876 to 1878, the United States asserted control over the area, a claim that is still disputed on the basis of the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie (see section \\"Controversy\\" below). Among American settlers, the peak was known variously as Cougar Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain, Slaughterhouse Mountain, and Keystone Cliffs. It was named Mount Rushmore during a prospecting expedition by Charles Rushmore, David Swanzey (husband of Carrie Ingalls), and Bill Challis.[14]\\r\\nHistorian Doane Robinson conceived the idea for Mount Rushmore in 1923 to promote tourism in South Dakota. In 1924, Robinson persuaded sculptor Gutzon Borglum to travel to the Black Hills region to ensure the carving could be accomplished. Borglum had been involved in sculpting the Confederate Memorial Carving, a massive bas-relief memorial to Confederate leaders on Stone Mountain in Georgia, but was in disagreement with the officials there.[15]\\r\\nThe original plan was to make the carvings in granite pillars known as the Needles. However, Borglum realized that the eroded Needles were too thin to support sculpting. He chose Mount Rushmore, a grander location, partly because it faced southeast and enjoyed maximum exposure to the sun. Borglum said upon seeing Mount Rushmore, \\"America will march along that skyline.\\"[16] Congress authorized the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Commission on March 3, 1925.[16]\\r\\nBetween October 4, 1927, and October 31, 1941, Gutzon Borglum and 400 workers[17] sculpted the colossal 60 foot (18?m) high carvings of U.S. presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln to represent the first 130 years of American history. These presidents were selected by Borglum because of their role in preserving the Republic and expanding its territory.[16][18] The carving of Mount Rushmore involved the use of dynamite, followed by the process of \\"honeycombing\\", a process where workers drill holes close together, allowing small pieces to be removed by hand.[19] In total, about 450,000 short tons (410,000?t) of rock were blasted off the mountainside.[20] The image of Thomas Jefferson was originally intended to appear in the area at Washington's right, but after the work there was begun, the rock was found to be unsuitable, so the work on the Jefferson figure was dynamited, and a new figure was sculpted to Washington's left.[16]\\r\\nThe Chief Carver of the mountain was Luigi del Bianco, artisan and headstone carver in Port Chester, NY. Del Bianco emigrated to the U.S. from Friuli in Italy, and was chosen to work on this project because of his remarkable skill at etching emotions and personality into his carved portraits.[2][3]\\r\\nIn 1933, the National Park Service took Mount Rushmore under its jurisdiction. Julian Spotts helped with the project by improving its infrastructure. For example, he had the tram upgraded so it could reach the top of Mount Rushmore for the ease of workers. By July 4, 1934, Washington's face had been completed and was dedicated. The face of Thomas Jefferson was dedicated in 1936, and the face of Abraham Lincoln was dedicated on September 17, 1937. In 1937, a bill was introduced in Congress to add the head of civil-rights leader Susan B. Anthony, but a rider was passed on an appropriations bill requiring federal funds be used to finish only those heads that had already been started at that time.[21] In 1939, the face of Theodore Roosevelt was dedicated.\\r\\nThe Sculptor's Studio?ÿ a display of unique plaster models and tools related to the sculpting?ÿ was built in 1939 under the direction of Borglum. Borglum had planned to make a secret room behind the hairline of Abraham Lincoln which was supposed to be a doorway to a chamber originally intended to hold some of America's most treasured documents but was left unfinished due to his death.[22] Borglum died from an embolism in March 1941. His son, Lincoln Borglum, continued the project. Originally, it was planned that the figures would be carved from head to waist,[23] but insufficient funding forced the carving to end. Borglum had also planned a massive panel in the shape of the Louisiana Purchase commemorating in eight-foot-tall gilded letters the Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution, Louisiana Purchase, and seven other territorial acquisitions from Alaska to Texas to the Panama Canal Zone.[18] In total, the entire project cost US$989,992.32.[24] Unusually for a project of such size, no workers died during the carving.[25]\\r\\nOn October 15, 1966, Mount Rushmore was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A 500-word essay giving the history of the United States by Nebraska student William Andrew Burkett was selected as the college-age group winner in a 1934 competition, and that essay was placed on the Entablature on a bronze plate in 1973.[21][26] In 1991, President George H. W. Bush officially dedicated Mount Rushmore.[27]\\r\\nIn a canyon behind the carved faces is a chamber, cut only 70 feet (21?m) into the rock, containing a vault with sixteen porcelain enamel panels. The panels include the text of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, biographies of the four presidents and Borglum, and the history of the U.S. The chamber was created as the entrance-way to a planned \\"Hall of Records\\"; the vault was installed in 1998.[28]\\r\\nTen years of redevelopment work culminated with the completion of extensive visitor facilities and sidewalks in 1998, such as a Visitor Center, the Lincoln Borglum Museum, and the Presidential Trail. Maintenance of the memorial requires mountain climbers to monitor and seal cracks annually. Due to budget constraints, the memorial is not regularly cleaned to remove lichens. However, on July 8, 2005, Alfred K?rcher GmbH, a German manufacturer of pressure washing and steam cleaning machines, conducted a free cleanup operation which lasted several weeks, using pressurized water at over 200?F (93?C).[29]\\r\\nThe flora and fauna of Mount Rushmore are similar to those of the rest of the Black Hills region of South Dakota. Birds including the turkey vulture, bald eagle, hawk, and meadowlark fly around Mount Rushmore, occasionally making nesting spots in the ledges of the mountain. Smaller birds, including songbirds, nuthatches, and woodpeckers, inhabit the surrounding pine forests.[30] Terrestrial mammals include the mouse, least chipmunk, red squirrel, skunk, porcupine, raccoon, beaver, badger, coyote, bighorn sheep, bobcat, elk, mule deer, yellow-bellied marmot, and American bison.[30][31] The striped chorus frog, western chorus frog, and northern leopard frog also inhabit the area,[32] along with several species of snake. Grizzly Bear Brook and Starling Basin Brook, the two streams in the memorial, support fish such as the longnose dace and the brook trout.[citation needed] Mountain goats are not indigenous to the region. Those living near Mount Rushmore are descendents of a tribe that Canada gifted to Custer State Park in 1924, which later escaped.[30][33][34]\\r\\nAt lower elevations, coniferous trees, mainly the ponderosa pine, surround most of the monument, providing shade from the sun. Other trees include the bur oak, the Black Hills spruce, and the cottonwood. Nine species of shrubs grow near Mount Rushmore. There is also a wide variety of wildflowers, including especially the snapdragon, sunflower, and violet. Towards higher elevations, plant life becomes sparser.[34] However, only approximately five percent of the plant species found in the Black Hills are indigenous to the region.[35]\\r\\nThe area receives about 18 inches (460?mm) of precipitation on average per year, enough to support abundant animal and plant life. Trees and other plants help to control surface runoff. Dikes, seeps, and springs help to dam up water that is flowing downhill, providing watering spots for animals. In addition, stones like sandstone and limestone help to hold groundwater, creating aquifers.[36]\\r\\nA study of the fire scars present in tree ring samples indicates that forest fires occur in the ponderosa forests surrounding Mount Rushmore around every 27 years. Large fires are not common. Most events have been ground fires that serve to clear forest debris.[37] The area is a climax community. Recent[when?] pine beetle infestations have threatened the forest.[31]\\r\\nMount Rushmore is largely composed of granite. The memorial is carved on the northwest margin of the Black Elk Peak granite batholith in the Black Hills of South Dakota, so the geologic formations of the heart of the Black Hills region are also evident at Mount Rushmore. The batholith magma intruded into the pre-existing mica schist rocks during the Proterozoic, 1.6 billion years ago.[38] Coarse grained pegmatite dikes are associated with the granite intrusion of Black Elk Peak and are visibly lighter in color, thus explaining the light-colored streaks on the foreheads of the presidents.\\r\\nThe Black Hills granites were exposed to erosion during the Neoproterozoic, but were later buried by sandstone and other sediments during the Cambrian. Remaining buried throughout the Paleozoic, they were re-exposed again during the Laramide orogeny around 70 million years ago.[38] The Black Hills area was uplifted as an elongated geologic dome.[39] Subsequent erosion stripped the granite of the overlying sediments and the softer adjacent schist. Some schist does remain and can be seen as the darker material just below the sculpture of Washington.\\r\\nThe tallest mountain in the region is Black Elk Peak (7,242?ft or 2,207?m). Borglum selected Mount Rushmore as the site for several reasons. The rock of the mountain is composed of smooth, fine-grained granite. The durable granite erodes only 1 inch (25?mm) every 10,000 years, thus was more than sturdy enough to support the sculpture and its long-term exposure.[16] The mountain's height of 5,725 feet (1,745?m) above sea level[6] made it suitable, and because it faces the southeast, the workers also had the advantage of sunlight for most of the day.\\r\\nThe Mount Rushmore area is underlain by well drained alfisol soils of very gravelly loam (Mocmount) to silt loam (Buska) texture, brown to dark grayish brown.[40]\\r\\nMount Rushmore has a humid continental climate (Dwb in the K?ppen climate classification). It is inside a USDA Plant Hardiness Zone of 5a, meaning certain plant life in the area can withstand a low temperature of no less than ?20?F (?29?C).[41]\\r\\nThe two wettest months of the year are May and June. Orographic lift causes brief but strong afternoon thunderstorms during the summer.[42]\\r\\nTourism is South Dakota's second-largest industry, and Mount Rushmore is the state's top tourist attraction.[45] In 2012, 2,185,447 people visited the park.[1] In the 1950s and 1960s, Sioux Benjamin Black Elk (son of medicine man Black Elk) was the \\"Fifth Face of Mount Rushmore\\", posing for photographs with thousands of tourists. He became one of the most photographed people in the world.[46]\\r\\nThe ongoing conservation of the site is overseen by the US National Park Service.[47] Physical efforts to conserve the monument have included replacement of the sealant applied originally by Gutzon Borglum, which had proved ineffective at providing water resistance (components include linseed oil, granite dust and white lead). A modern silicone replacement was used, disguised with granite dust.\\r\\nIn 1998, electronic monitoring devices were installed to track movement in the topology of the sculpture to an accuracy of 3?mm. The site has been subsequently digitally recorded using a terrestrial laser scanning methodology in 2009 as part of the international Scottish Ten project, providing a record of unprecedented resolution and accuracy to inform the conservation of the site. This data was made accessible online to be freely used by the wider community to aid further interpretation and public access.[48]\\r\\nThe United States seized the area from the Lakota tribe after the Great Sioux War of 1876. The Treaty of Fort Laramie from 1868 had previously granted the Black Hills to the Lakota in perpetuity. Members of the American Indian Movement led an occupation of the monument in 1971, naming it \\"Mount Crazy Horse\\". Among the participants were young activists, grandparents, children and Lakota holy man John Fire Lame Deer, who planted a prayer staff atop the mountain. Lame Deer said the staff formed a symbolic shroud over the presidents' faces \\"which shall remain dirty until the treaties concerning the Black Hills are fulfilled.\\"[49]\\r\\nIn 2004, the first Native American superintendent of the park, Gerard Baker, was appointed. Baker has stated that he will open up more \\"avenues of interpretation\\", and that the four presidents are \\"only one avenue and only one focus.\\"[50]\\r\\nThe Crazy Horse Memorial is being constructed elsewhere in the Black Hills to commemorate the famous Native American leader as a response to Mount Rushmore. It is said to be larger than Mount Rushmore and has the support of Lakota chiefs; the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation has rejected offers of federal funds. However, this memorial is likewise the subject of controversy, even within the Native American community.[51]\\r\\nBecause of its fame as a monument, Mount Rushmore has been depicted in multiple places in popular culture. It is often depicted as a cover for a secret location; shown with faces removed or modified (as in Superman II), or added; or parodied. Trey Parker and Matt Stone used the location as the headquarters for their movie Team America: World Police. The memorial was also famously used as the location of the climactic chase scene in Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 movie North by Northwest.[52]\\r\\nOn August 11, 1952, the U.S. Post Office issued the Mount Rushmore Memorial commemorative stamp on the 25th anniversary of the dedication of the Mt. Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota.[53] On January 2, 1974, a 26-cent airmail stamp depicting the monument was also issued.[54]\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nFurther reading","input":"What is the american indian name for mount rushmore?"},{"output":"cakes","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech cuisine (Czech: ?esk kuchyn) has both influenced and been influenced by the cuisines of surrounding countries. Many of the cakes and pastries that are popular in Central Europe originated within the Czech lands. Contemporary Czech cuisine is more meat-based than in previous periods; the current abundance of farmable meat has enriched its presence in regional cuisine. Traditionally, meat has been reserved for once-weekly consumption, typically on weekends. The body of Czech meals typically consists of two or more courses; the first course is traditionally soup, the second course is the main dish, and the third course can include supplementary courses, such as dessert or compote (kompot). In the Czech cuisine, thick soups and many kinds of sauces, both based on stewed or cooked vegetables and meats, often with cream, as well as baked meats with natural sauces (gravies), are popular dishes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDumplings (knedlky) (steamed and sliced bread-like) are one of the mainstays of Czech cuisine and are typically served with meals. They can be either wheat or potato-based, and are sometimes made from a combination of wheat flour and dices made of stale bread or rolls. Puffed rice can be found in store-prepared mixtures. Smaller Czech dumplings are usually potato-based. When served as leftovers, sliced dumplings are sometimes pan-fried with eggs. Czech potato dumplings are often filled with smoked meat and served with spinach or sour cabbage. Fried onion and braised cabbage can be included as a side dish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many other side dishes, including noodles (nudle) and boiled or risotto rice (ry?e or rizoto), which is sometimes served in the form of rice pudding (ry?ovy nkyp). Potatoes (brambory) are served boiled with salt, often with caraway seed and butter, pork fat or oil. Peeled and boiled potatoes are mixed into mashed potatoes (bramborov ka?e). New potatoes are sometimes boiled in their skins, not peeled, from harvest time to new year. Because of the influence of foreign countries, potatoes are also fried, so French fries and croquettes are common in restaurants.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuckwheat (pohanka), pearl barley (kroupy) and millet grains (jhly) are rarely served in restaurants. These are more commonly a home-cooked, healthier alternative. Pasta (tstoviny) is common, either baked, boiled, cooked with other ingredients or served as a salad. Pasta is available in different shapes and flavours. This is an influence of Italian and Asian cuisine. Rice and buckwheat noodles are not common, but are becoming more popular. Gluten-free pasta is also available, made from corn flour, corn starch or potatoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBread (chlb or chleba) is traditionally sourdough baked from rye and wheat, and is flavoured with salt, caraway seed (kmn), onion, garlic, seeds, or pork crackling. It is eaten as an accompaniment to soups and dishes. It is also the material for Czech croutons and for topinkyslices of bread fried in a pan on both sides and rubbed with garlic. Rolls (rohlk), buns (?emle), and braided buns (houska) are the most common forms of bread eaten for breakfast; these are often topped with poppy seeds and salt or other seeds. A bun or a roll baked from bread dough is called a dalamnek. A sweet roll or loupk is a crescent-shaped roll made from sweetened dough containing milk. It is smeared with egg and sprinkled with poppy seeds before baking, giving it a golden-brown colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoup (polvka, colloquially polvka) plays an important role in Czech cuisine. Soups commonly found in Czech restaurants are beef, chicken or vegetable broth with noodlesoptionally served with liver or nutmeg dumplings; garlic soup (?esne?ka) with croutonsoptionally served with minced sausage, raw egg, or cheese; and cabbage soup (zela?ka) made from sauerkrautsometimes served with minced sausage. Kyselica is a Wallachian variety and contains sour cream, bacon, potatoes, eggs and sausage.\\r\\n\\r\\nPea (hrachovka), bean (fazolov) and lentil soups (?o?kov polvka) are commonly cooked at home. Goulash soup (gul?ovka) and dr??kov are made from beef or pork tripe (dr??ky) cut into small pieces and cooked with other ingredients; the meat can be substituted with oyster mushrooms. Potato soup (brambora?ka) is made from potato, onion, carrot, root parsley and celeriac, spiced with caraway seed, garlic and marjoram. Fish soup (ryb polvka) made with carp is a traditional Christmas dish.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther common Czech soups are champignon or other mushroom soup (houbov polvka), tomato soup (rajsk polvka), vegetable soup (zeleninov polvka), onion soup (cibula?ka) and bread soup (chlebov polvka). Kulajda is a traditional South Bohemian soup containing water, cream, spices, mushrooms, egg (often a quail's egg), dill and potatoes.[1] It is typical in its thickness, white color and characteristic taste. The main ingredient is mushrooms, which gives it the dish's scent. Kyselo is a regional specialty soup made from rye sourdough, mushrooms, caraway and fried onion.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditional Czech dishes are made from animals, birds or fish bred in the surrounding areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nPork is the most common meat, making up over half of all meat consumption.[2] Beef, veal and chicken are also popular. Pigs are often a source of meat in the countryside, since pork has a relatively short production time, compared to beef.\\r\\n\\r\\nJitrnice is the meat and offal of pork cut into tiny pieces, filled in a casing and closed with sticks. Meat from the neck, sides, lungs, spleen, and liver are cooked with white pastry, broth, salt, spices, garlic and sometimes onions. Klobsa, known as Kielbasa in the United States, is a smoked meat sausage-like product made from minced meat. It is spicy and durable. Jelito is a pork meat sausage-like product containing pork blood and pearl barley or pastry pieces. Tla?enka is a meat or poultry product consisting of little pieces of meat in jelly/aspic from connective tissue boiled to mush, served with onion, vinegar and bread. Ovar is a simple dish made from rather fatty pork meat (head or knuckle). These pieces of lower quality meat are boiled in salted water. Pork crackling (?kvarky) and bacon (slanina) are also eaten.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn restaurants one can find:\\r\\n\\r\\nCommonly-found poultry dishes are:\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from beer, Czechs also produce wine and two unique liquorsFernet Stock and Becherovka. Czech Slivovitz and other Plenka (fruit brandies) are also popular. Tuzemak, traditionally marketed as \\"Czech rum\\", is made from potatoes or sugar beets. Slovak Borovi?ka is also common. A mixed drink consisting of Becherovka and tonic water is known under the portmanteau of Beton (\\"concrete\\"). Another popular mixed drink is Fernet Stock mixed with tonic, called \\"Bavork\\" or \\"Bavorsk pivo\\" (literally \\"Bavarian beer\\"). Kofola is a non-alcoholic Czech soft drink somewhat similar in look and taste to Coca-Cola, but not as sweet. Kofola was invented in communist Czechoslovakia as a substitute to the Coca-Cola that they would not import, but it became so popular that production has continued well past the end of communism in the country.[9]","input":"What kind of food is in czech republic?"},{"output":"roughly 42,000ÿ72,000 years ago","context":"Clothing (also known as clothes and attire) is fiber and textile material worn on the body. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of nearly all human societies. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on body type, social, and geographic considerations. Some clothing can be gender-specific.\\r\\nPhysically, clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements, and can enhance safety during hazardous activities such as hiking and cooking. It protects the wearer from rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, insect bites, splinters, thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions. Further, they can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation. Wearing clothes is also a social norm, as being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing, or not wearing clothes in public to the extent that genitals, breasts or buttocks are visible could be seen as indecent exposure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed, but some information has been inferred by studying lice which estimates put the introduction of clothing at roughly 42,000ÿ72,000 years ago.[1][2][3][4] [5]\\r\\nThe most obvious function of clothing is to improve the comfort of the wearer, by protecting the wearer from the elements. In hot climates, clothing provides protection from sunburn or wind damage, while in cold climates its thermal insulation properties are generally more important. Shelter usually reduces the functional need for clothing. For example, coats, hats, gloves, and other superficial layers are normally removed when entering a warm home, particularly if one is residing or sleeping there. Similarly, clothing has seasonal and regional aspects, so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer seasons and regions than in colder ones.\\r\\nClothing performs a range of social and cultural functions, such as individual, occupational and gender differentiation, and social status.[6] In many societies, norms about clothing reflect standards of modesty, religion, gender, and social status. Clothing may also function as a form of adornment and an expression of personal taste or style.\\r\\nClothing can and has in history been made from a very wide variety of materials. Materials have ranged from leather and furs, to woven materials, to elaborate and exotic natural and synthetic fabrics. Not all body coverings are regarded as clothing. Articles carried rather than worn (such as purses), worn on a single part of the body and easily removed (scarves), worn purely for adornment (jewelry), or those that serve a function other than protection (eyeglasses), are normally considered accessories rather than clothing, as are footwear and hats.\\r\\nClothing protects against many things that might injure the uncovered human body. Clothes protect people from the elements, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. However, clothing that is too sheer, thin, small, tight, etc., offers less protection. Clothes also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport. Some clothing protects from specific environmental hazards, such as insects, noxious chemicals, weather, weapons, and contact with abrasive substances. Conversely, clothing may protect the environment from the clothing wearer, as with doctors wearing medical scrubs.\\r\\nHumans have shown extreme invention in devising clothing solutions to environmental hazards. Examples include: space suits, air conditioned clothing, armor, diving suits, swimsuits, bee-keeper gear, motorcycle leathers, high-visibility clothing, and other pieces of protective clothing. Meanwhile, the distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cutsince clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider fashion in their design. Wearing clothes also has social implications. They cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered, act as a form of adornment, and serve other social purposes.\\r\\nAlthough dissertations on clothing and its function appear from the 19th century as colonising countries dealt with new environments,[7] concerted scientific research into psycho-social, physiological and other functions of clothing (e.g. protective, cartage) occurred in the first half of the 20th century, with publications such as J. C. Flgel's Psychology of Clothes in 1930,[6] and Newburgh's seminal Physiology of Heat Regulation and The Science of Clothing in 1949.[8] By 1968, the field of environmental physiology had advanced and expanded significantly, but the science of clothing in relation to environmental physiology had changed little.[9] While considerable research has since occurred and the knowledge-base has grown significantly, the main concepts remain unchanged, and indeed Newburgh's book is still cited by contemporary authors, including those attempting to develop thermoregulatory models of clothing development.[10]\\r\\nIn most cultures, gender differentiation of clothing is considered appropriate. The differences are in styles, colors and fabrics.\\r\\nIn Western societies, skirts, dresses and high-heeled shoes are usually seen as women's clothing, while neckties are usually seen as men's clothing. Trousers were once seen as exclusively male clothing, but can nowadays be worn by both genders. Male clothes are often more practical (that is, they can function well under a wide variety of situations), but a wider range of clothing styles are available for females. Males are typically allowed to bare their chests in a greater variety of public places. It is generally more or less acceptable for a woman to wear clothing perceived as masculine, while the opposite is seen as unusual.\\r\\nIn some cultures, sumptuary laws regulate what men and women are required to wear. Islam requires women to wear more modest forms of attire, usually hijab. What qualifies as \\"modest\\" varies in different Muslim societies. However, women are usually required to cover more of their bodies than men are. Articles of clothing Muslim women wear for modesty range from the head-scarf to the burqa.\\r\\nMen may sometimes choose to wear men's skirts such as togas or kilts, especially on ceremonial occasions. Such garments were (in previous times) often worn as normal daily clothing by men.\\r\\nClothing designed to be worn by either sex is called unisex clothing. Unisex clothes, such as T-shirts, tends to be cut straighter to fit a wider variety of bodies. The majority of unisex clothing styles have started out as menswear, but some articles, like the fedora, were originally worn by women.\\r\\nIn some societies, clothing may be used to indicate rank or status. In ancient Rome, for example, only senators could wear garments dyed with Tyrian purple. In traditional Hawaiian society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear feather cloaks and palaoa, or carved whale teeth. In China, before establishment of the republic, only the emperor could wear yellow. History provides many examples of elaborate sumptuary laws that regulated what people could wear. In societies without such laws, which includes most modern societies, social status is instead signaled by the purchase of rare or luxury items that are limited by cost to those with wealth or status. In addition, peer pressure influences clothing choice.\\r\\nReligious clothing might be considered a special case of occupational clothing. Sometimes it is worn only during the performance of religious ceremonies. However, it may also be worn everyday as a marker for special religious status.\\r\\nFor example, Jains and Muslim men wear unstitched cloth pieces when performing religious ceremonies. The unstitched cloth signifies unified and complete devotion to the task at hand, with no digression.[citation needed] Sikhs wear a turban as it is a part of their religion.\\r\\nThe cleanliness of religious dresses in Eastern religions like Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Islam and Jainism is of paramount importance, since it indicates purity.\\r\\nClothing figures prominently in the Bible where it appears in numerous contexts, the more prominent ones being: the story of Adam and Eve who made coverings for themselves out of fig leaves, Joseph's cloak, Judah and Tamar, Mordecai and Esther. Furthermore, the priests officiating in the Temple had very specific garments, the lack of which made one liable to death.\\r\\nThe Quran says about husbands and wives, regarding clothing: \\"...They are clothing/covering (Libaas) for you; and you for them\\" (chapter 2:187).\\r\\nJewish ritual also requires rending of one's upper garment as a sign of mourning. This practice is found in the Bible when Jacob hears of the apparent death of his son Joseph.[11]\\r\\nAccording to archaeologists and anthropologists, the earliest clothing likely consisted of fur, leather, leaves, or grass that were draped, wrapped, or tied around the body. Knowledge of such clothing remains inferential, since clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared to stone, bone, shell and metal artifacts. Archeologists have identified very early sewing needles of bone and ivory from about 30,000 BC, found near Kostenki, Russia in 1988.[12] Dyed flax fibers that could have been used in clothing have been found in a prehistoric cave in the Republic of Georgia that date back to 36,000 BP.[13][14]\\r\\nScientists are still debating when people started wearing clothes. Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking, anthropologists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, have conducted a genetic analysis of human body lice that suggests clothing originated quite recently, around 170,000 years ago. Body lice is an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern Homo sapiens away from the warm climate of Africa, thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago [15] For now, the date of the origin of clothing remains unresolved.\\r\\nSome human cultures, such as the various people of the Arctic Circle, traditionally make their clothing entirely of prepared and decorated furs and skins. Other cultures supplemented or replaced leather and skins with cloth: woven, knitted, or twined from various animal and vegetable fibers including wool, linen, cotton, silk, hemp, and ramie.\\r\\nAlthough modern consumers may take the production of clothing for granted, making fabric by hand is a tedious and labor-intensive process involving fiber making, spinning, and weaving. The textile industry was the first to be mechanized?ÿ with the powered loom?ÿ during the Industrial Revolution.\\r\\nDifferent cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of cloth. One approach simply involves draping the cloth. Many people wore, and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit?ÿ for example, the dhoti for men and the sari for women in the Indian subcontinent, the Scottish kilt or the Javanese sarong. The clothes may simply be tied up, as is the case of the first two garments; or pins or belts hold the garments in place, as in the case of the latter two. The precious cloth remains uncut, and people of various sizes or the same person at different sizes can wear the garment.\\r\\nAnother approach involves measuring, cutting, and sewing the cloth by hand or with a sewing machine. Clothing can be cut from a sewing pattern and adjusted by a tailor to a persons measurements. An adjustable sewing mannequin or dress form is used to create form fitting clothing. Fabrics are expensive and efforts are made to use every bit of the cloth rectangle in constructing the clothing. The tailor may cut triangular pieces from one corner of the cloth, and then add them elsewhere as gussets. Traditional European patterns for men's shirts and women's chemises take this approach. These remnant can also be rused to make patchwork hats, vests, and skirts.\\r\\nModern European fashion treats cloth much less conservatively, typically cutting in such a way as to leave various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing operations sell these as waste; home sewers may turn them into quilts.\\r\\nIn the thousands of years that humans have spent constructing clothing, they have created an astonishing array of styles, many of which have been reconstructed from surviving garments, photos, paintings, mosaics, etc., as well as from written descriptions. Costume history serves as a source of inspiration to current fashion designers, as well as a topic of professional interest to costumers constructing for plays, films, television, and historical reenactment.\\r\\nThe Western dress code has changed over the past 500+ years. The mechanization of the textile industry made many varieties of cloth widely available at affordable prices. Styles have changed, and the availability of synthetic fabrics has changed the definition of \\"stylish\\". In the latter half of the 20th century, blue jeans became very popular, and are now worn to events that normally demand formal attire. Activewear has also become a large and growing market.\\r\\nThe licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers like Pierre Cardin in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the fashion industry from about the 1970s. Among the more popular include Marc Jacobs and Gucci, named for Marc Jacobs and Guccio Gucci respectively.\\r\\nBy the early years of the 21st century, western clothing styles had, to some extent, become international styles. This process began hundreds of years earlier, during the periods of European colonialism. The process of cultural dissemination has perpetuated over the centuries as Western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world, spreading Western culture and styles. Fast fashion clothing has also become a global phenomenon. These garments are less expensive, mass-produced Western clothing. Donated used clothing from Western countries are also delivered to people in poor countries by charity organizations.\\r\\nPeople may wear ethnic or national dress on special occasions or in certain roles or occupations. For example, most Korean men and women have adopted Western-style dress for daily wear, but still wear traditional hanboks on special occasions, like weddings and cultural holidays. Items of Western dress may also appear worn or accessorized in distinctive, non-Western ways. A Tongan man may combine a used T-shirt with a Tongan wrapped skirt, or tupenu.\\r\\nMost sports and physical activities are practiced wearing special clothing, for practical, comfort or safety reasons. Common sportswear garments include shorts, T-shirts, tennis shirts, leotards, tracksuits, and trainers. Specialized garments include wet suits (for swimming, diving or surfing), salopettes (for skiing) and leotards (for gymnastics). Also, spandex materials are often used as base layers to soak up sweat. Spandex is also preferable for active sports that require form fitting garments, such as volleyball, wrestling, track & field, dance, gymnastics and swimming.\\r\\nThe world of clothing is always changing, as new cultural influences meet technological innovations. Researchers in scientific labs have been developing prototypes for fabrics that can serve functional purposes well beyond their traditional roles, for example, clothes that can automatically adjust their temperature, repel bullets, project images, and generate electricity. Some practical advances already available to consumers are bullet-resistant garments made with kevlar and stain-resistant fabrics that are coated with chemical mixtures that reduce the absorption of liquids. New blends of Spandex cotton blends allow for form fitting and stretching of closer fitting mass produced patterns. New mesh materials allow for better breathe-ability in shoes. New insulation fibers and batting make lighter rainments that keep you warm when wet and recent advances in coatings for fabrics or down also repel water.\\r\\nThough mechanization transformed most aspects of human industry by the mid-20th century, garment workers have continued to labor under challenging conditions that demand repetitive manual labor. Mass-produced clothing is often made in what are considered by some to be sweatshops, typified by long work hours, lack of benefits, and lack of worker representation. While most examples of such conditions are found in developing countries, clothes made in industrialized nations may also be manufactured similarly.[citation needed]\\r\\nCoalitions of NGOs, designers (including Katharine Hamnett, American Apparel, Veja, Quiksilver, eVocal, and Edun) and campaign groups like the Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) and the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights as well as textile and clothing trade unions have sought to improve these conditions as much as possible by sponsoring awareness-raising events, which draw the attention of both the media and the general public to the workers.\\r\\nOutsourcing production to low wage countries like Bangladesh, China, India and Sri Lanka became possible when the Multi Fibre Agreement (MFA) was abolished. The MFA, which placed quotas on textiles imports, was deemed a protectionist measure.[citation needed] Although many countries recognize treaties like the International Labour Organization, which attempt to set standards for worker safety and rights, many countries have made exceptions to certain parts of the treaties or failed to thoroughly enforce them. India for example has not ratified sections 87 and 92 of the treaty.[citation needed]\\r\\nDespite the strong reactions that \\"sweatshops\\" evoked among critics of globalization, the production of textiles has functioned as a consistent industry for developing nations providing work and wages, whether construed as exploitative or not, to many thousands of people.\\r\\nThe use of animal fur in clothing dates to prehistoric times. It is currently associated in developed countries with expensive, designer clothing, although fur is still used by indigenous people in arctic zones and higher elevations for its warmth and protection. Once uncontroversial, it has recently been the focus of campaigns on the grounds that campaigners consider it cruel and unnecessary. PETA, along with other animal rights and animal liberation groups have called attention to fur farming and other practices they consider cruel.\\r\\nClothing suffers assault both from within and without. The human body sheds skin cells and body oils, and exudes sweat, urine, and feces. From the outside, sun damage, moisture, abrasion and dirt assault garments. Fleas and lice can hide in seams. Worn clothing, if not cleaned and refurbished, itches, looks scruffy, and loses functionality (as when buttons fall off, seams come undone, fabrics thin or tear, and zippers fail).\\r\\nIn some cases, people wear an item of clothing until it falls apart. Cleaning leather presents difficulties, and bark cloth (tapa) cannot be washed without dissolving it. Owners may patch tears and rips, and brush off surface dirt, but old leather and bark clothing always look old.\\r\\nBut most clothing consists of cloth, and most cloth can be laundered and mended (patching, darning, but compare felt).\\r\\nHumans have developed many specialized methods for laundering, ranging from early methods of pounding clothes against rocks in running streams, to the latest in electronic washing machines and dry cleaning (dissolving dirt in solvents other than water). Hot water washing (boiling), chemical cleaning and ironing are all traditional methods of sterilizing fabrics for hygiene purposes.\\r\\nMany kinds of clothing are designed to be ironed before they are worn to remove wrinkles. Most modern formal and semi-formal clothing is in this category (for example, dress shirts and suits). Ironed clothes are believed to look clean, fresh, and neat. Much contemporary casual clothing is made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle, and do not require ironing. Some clothing is permanent press, having been treated with a coating (such as polytetrafluoroethylene) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing.\\r\\nOnce clothes have been laundered and possibly ironed, they are usually hung on clothes hangers or folded, to keep them fresh until they are worn. Clothes are folded to allow them to be stored compactly, to prevent creasing, to preserve creases or to present them in a more pleasing manner, for instance when they are put on sale in stores.\\r\\nA resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases formaldehyde, which could cause contact dermatitis for some people; no disclosure requirements exist, and in 2008 the U.S. Government Accountability Office tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants.[16] In 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing, 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm, which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure.[17]\\r\\nIn past times, mending was an art. A meticulous tailor or seamstress could mend rips with thread raveled from hems and seam edges so skillfully that the tear was practically invisible. When the raw material?ÿ cloth?ÿ was worth more than labor, it made sense to expend labor in saving it. Today clothing is considered a consumable item. Mass-manufactured clothing is less expensive than the labor required to repair it. Many people buy a new piece of clothing rather than spend time mending. The thrifty still replace zippers and buttons and sew up ripped hems.\\r\\nUsed, unwearable clothing can be repurposed for quilts, rags, rugs, bandages, and many other household uses. It can also be recycled into paper. In Western societies, used clothing is often thrown out or donated to charity (such as through a clothing bin). It is also sold to consignment shops, dress agencies, flea markets, and in online auctions. Used clothing is also often collected on an industrial scale to be sorted and shipped for re-use in poorer countries.\\r\\nThere are many concerns about the life cycle of synthetics, which come primarily from petrochemicals.[weasel?words] Unlike natural fibers, their source is not renewable and they are not biodegradable.[18]","input":"When was the first piece of clothing invented?"},{"output":"Kiribati","context":"","input":"What country is the first to see a new day?"},{"output":"President","context":"The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) is a body of senior uniformed leaders in the United States Department of Defense who advise the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, the Homeland Security Council and the National Security Council on military matters. The composition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is defined by statute and consists of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (VCJCS), the Military Service Chiefs from the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force, and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau,[1] all appointed by the President following Senate confirmation.[2] Each of the individual Military Service Chiefs, outside their Joint Chiefs of Staff obligations, works directly for the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, i.e., Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Air Force.[3][4][5][6]\\r\\nFollowing the GoldwaterÿNichols Act in 1986, the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not have operational command authority, either individually or collectively, as the chain of command goes from the President to the Secretary of Defense, and from the Secretary of Defense to the Commanders of the Combatant Commands.[7] GoldwaterÿNichols also created the office of Vice Chairman, and the Chairman is now designated as the principal military adviser to the Secretary of Defense, the Homeland Security Council, the National Security Council and the President.[8]\\r\\nThe Joint Staff (JS) is a headquarters staff in the Pentagon, composed of personnel from each of the five armed services, that assists the Chairman and the Vice Chairman in discharging their responsibilities and is managed by the Director of the Joint Staff (DJS), who is a lieutenant general or Navy vice admiral.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 1986 reorganization of the military undertaken by the Goldwater-Nichols Act, the Joint Chiefs of Staff does not have operational command of U.S. military forces. Responsibility for conducting military operations goes from the President to the Secretary of Defense directly to the commanders of the Unified Combatant Commands and thus bypasses the Joint Chiefs of Staff completely.\\r\\nToday, their primary responsibility is to ensure the personnel readiness, policy, planning and training of their respective military services for the combatant commanders to utilize. The Joint Chiefs of Staff also act in a military advisory capacity for the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense. In addition, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff acts as the chief military advisor to the President and the Secretary of Defense. In this strictly advisory role, the Joint Chiefs constitute the second-highest deliberatory body for military policy, after the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council, which includes the President and other officials besides the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\\r\\nWhile serving as chairman or Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Chief of Staff of the Army, Commandant of the Marine Corps, Chief of Naval Operations, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, or Commandant of the Coast Guard, the salary is $15,583.20 a month,[10] regardless of cumulative years of service completed under section 205 of title 37, United States Code.\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\nAs the military of the United States grew in size following the American Civil War, joint military action between the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy became increasingly difficult. The Army and Navy were unsupportive of each other at either the planning or operational level and were constrained by disagreements during the SpanishÿAmerican War in the Caribbean campaigns.[12] The Joint Army and Navy Board was established in 1903 by President Theodore Roosevelt, comprising representatives from the military heads and chief planners of both the Navy's General Board and the Army's General Staff. The Joint Board acting as an \\"advisory committee\\" was created to plan joint operations and resolve problems of common rivalry between the two services.[12]\\r\\nYet, the Joint Board accomplished little as its charter gave it no authority to enforce its decisions. The Joint Board also lacked the ability to originate its own opinions and was thus limited to commenting only on the problems submitted to it by the Secretaries of War and Navy. As a result, the Joint Board had little to no impact on the manner the United States conducted World War I.\\r\\nAfter World War I, in 1919 the two Secretaries agreed to reestablish and revitalize the Joint Board. The mission of the General staff was to develop plans for mobilization for the next war; the US was always designated \\"Blue\\" and potential enemies were assigned various other colors.[13]\\r\\nThis time, the Joint Board's membership would include the Chiefs of Staff, their deputies, and the Chief of War Plans Division for the Army and Director of Plans Division for the Navy. Under the Joint Board would be a staff called the Joint Planning Committee to serve the Board. Along with new membership, the Joint Board could initiate recommendations on its own initiative. However, the Joint Board still did not possess the legal authority to enforce its decisions.\\r\\nPresident of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Winston Churchill established the Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) during the 1942 Arcadia Conference.[14] The CCS would serve as the supreme military body for strategic direction of the combined US-British Empire war effort.\\r\\nThe UK portion of the CCS would be composed of the British Chiefs of Staff Committee, but the United States had no equivalent body. The Joint Board's lack of authority made it of little use to the CCS, although its 1935 publication, Joint Action of the Army and Navy, did give some guidance for the joint operations during World War II. The Joint Board had little influence during the war and was ultimately disbanded in 1947.\\r\\nAs a counterpart to the UK's Chiefs of Staff Committee in the CCS, and to provide better coordinated effort and coordinated staff work for America's military effort, Admiral William D. Leahy proposed a \\"unified high command\\" in what would come to be called the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Modeled on the British Chiefs of Staff Committee, the JCS' first formal meeting was held on 9 February 1942, to coordinate U.S. military operations between War and Navy Departments.[14][15] The official history of the Army Air Forces noted that although there was \\"no official charter establishing this committee...by the end of February it had assumed responsibilities toward the American war effort comparable to the CCS on the combined level.\\"[16] On 20 July 1942, Admiral Leahy became the Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy (\\"Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States\\" is the military title of the U.S. President, per Article II,  2, of the Constitution), with the chiefs of staff of the services serving under his leadership.\\r\\nThe first members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were:[17]\\r\\nAs the table indicates, each of the members of the original Joint Chiefs was a four-star flag officer in his respective service branch. By the end of the war, however, each had been promoted: Leahy and King to Fleet Admiral; Marshall and Arnold to General of the Army. Arnold was later appointed to the grade of General of the Air Force.\\r\\nOne of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's committees was the Joint Strategic Survey Committee (JSSC). The JSSC was an extraordinary JCS committee that existed from 1942 until 1947. It was \\"one of the most influential planning agencies in the wartime armed forces.\\"[18] Members included Lieutenant General Stanley D. Embick, U.S. Army, chairman, 1942ÿ, Vice Admiral Russell Willson, U.S. Navy, 1942ÿ1945, Vice Admiral Theodore Stark Wilkinson, U.S. Navy, 1946, and Major General Muir S. Fairchild, U.S. Army Air Force, 1942ÿ.\\r\\nWith the end of World War II, the Joint Chiefs of Staff was officially established under the National Security Act of 1947. Per the National Security Act, the JCS consisted of a chairman, the Chief of Staff of the Army, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (which was established as a separate service by the same Act), and the Chief of Naval Operations. The Commandant of the Marine Corps was to be consulted on matters concerning the Corps, but was not a regular member; General Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr., Commandant in 1952ÿ55, was the first to sit as an occasional member. The law was amended during the term of General Louis H. Wilson, Jr. (1975ÿ79), making the Commandant a full-time JCS member in parity with the other three DoD services.\\r\\nThe position of vice-chairman was created by the GoldwaterÿNichols Act of 1986 to complement the CJCS, as well as to delegate some of the chairman's responsibilities, particularly resource allocation through the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).\\r\\nGeneral Colin L. Powell (1989ÿ93) was the first and, as of 2011, the only African American to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General Peter Pace (Vice chairman 2001ÿ05; Chairman, 2005ÿ07) was the first Marine to serve in either position. No woman has ever served on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\\r\\nA provision in the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act added the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Guard historians called it the \\"most significant development\\" for the National Guard since the Militia Act of 1903.[1]\\r\\nThe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is, by law, the highest-ranking military officer of the United States Armed Forces,[19] and the principal military adviser to the President of the United States. He leads the meetings and coordinates the efforts of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, comprising the chairman, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, the Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, the Chief of Naval Operations, the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have offices in The Pentagon. The chairman outranks all respective heads of each service branch,[20] but does not have command authority over them, their service branches or the Unified Combatant Commands.[20] All combatant commanders receive operational orders directly from the Secretary of Defense.[21]\\r\\nThe current chairman is General Joseph Dunford, USMC, who began his term on October 1, 2015.\\r\\nOn 20 July 1942, Navy Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy became the Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy (20 July 1942 ÿ 21 March 1949). He was not technically the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Leahy's office was the precursor to the post of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That post was established and first held by General of the Army Omar Bradley in 1949.\\r\\nThe position of Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was created by the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986. The vice-chairman is a four-star-general or admiral and, by law, is the second highest-ranking member of the U.S. Armed Forces (after the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff). In the absence of the chairman, the vice-chairman presides over the meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He may also perform such duties as the chairman may prescribe. It was not until the National Defense Authorization Act in 1992 that the position was made a full voting member of the JCS.[22]\\r\\nThe current vice-chairman is General Paul J. Selva, USAF.\\r\\nThe Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (SEAC) advises on all matters concerning joint and combined total force integration, utilization, development, and helps develop noncommissioned officers related joint professional education, enhance utilization of senior NCOs on joint battle staffs, and support the chairmans responsibilities as directed.\\r\\nCommand Sergeant Major William Gainey, USA, was the first SEAC, serving from October 1, 2005. The current SEAC is Command Sergeant Major John W. Troxell, US Army, who was sworn in by Joint Chiefs Chairman General Joseph Dunford on December 11, 2015, replacing Sergeant Major Bryan B. Battaglia, USMC.\\r\\nThe Joint Staff (JS) is a military headquarters staff based at the Pentagon, composed of personnel from all the five armed services, assisting the Chairman and the Vice Chairman in discharging their responsibilities. They work closely with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Military Department staffs, and the Combatant Command Staffs.\\r\\nThe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is assisted by the Director of the Joint Staff, a three-star officer who assists the chairman with the management of the Joint Staff, an organization composed of approximately equal numbers of officers contributed by the Army, the Navy and Marine Corps, the Air Force, and the Coast Guard, who have been assigned to assist the chairman in providing to the Secretary of Defense unified strategic direction, operation, and integration of the combatant land, naval, and air forces.\\r\\nThe Joint Staff includes the following departments where all the planning, policies, intelligence, manpower, communications and logistics functions are translated into action.[23]\\r\\nThe Joint Chiefs may recognize private citizens, organizations or career civilian government employees for significant achievements provided to the joint community with one of the following decorations / awards.[28]\\r\\nAlthough the Coast Guard is one of the five armed services of the United States, the Commandant of the Coast Guard is not a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Commandant is, however, entitled to the same supplemental pay as the Joint Chiefs, per 37 U.S.C.  414(a)(5) ($4,000 per annum in 2009), and is accorded privilege of the floor under Senate Rule XXIII(1) as a de facto JCS member during Presidential addresses. In contrast to the Joint Chiefswho are not in the military's operational chain of command, the Commandant of the Coast Guard commands his service. Coast Guard officers are legally eligible to be appointed as CJCS and VCJCS, per 10 U.S.C. 152(a)(1) & 154(a)(1) respectivelywhich use the collective term \\"armed forces\\" rather than listing the eligible servicesbut none has been appointed to either position as of 2016. The Coast Guard does have one officer who was appointed in 2016 to the Joint Staff who currently serves as J6.","input":"Who is the highest ranking military officer today?"},{"output":"Minong, Wisconsin","context":"Jack Link's Beef Jerky is an American[2] snack company best known as the producer and marketer of the eponymous brand of beef jerky.
