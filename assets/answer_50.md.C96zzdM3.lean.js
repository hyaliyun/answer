The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic ."},{"query":"yo la tengo theres a riot going on release date","short_answer":"Tengo , and was","abstract":"There 's a Riot Going On is the fifteenth full - length studio album by the American band Yo La Tengo , and was released through Matador Records on March 16 , 2018 ."},{"query":"the bay and the islands of colonia del sacramento","short_answer":"","abstract":"Colonia del Sacramento ( Spanish pronunciation : ( koˈlonja ðel sakɾaˈmento ) ; formerly the Portuguese Colónia do Sacramento ) is a city in southwestern Uruguay , by the Río de la Plata , facing Buenos Aires , Argentina .

More generally , exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power , always producing a positive result , so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers b and x where b is not equal to 1 . The logarithm of x to base b , denoted log ( x ) ( or log x when no confusion is possible ) , is the unique real number y such that b = x . For example , log 64 = 6 , as 64 = 2 ."},{"query":"who plays captain phasma in star wars the force awakens","short_answer":"franchise ,","abstract":"Captain Phasma is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise , portrayed by Gwendoline Christie .

Scientists and conservationists need a species definition which allows them to work , regardless of the theoretical difficulties . If as Linnaeus thought , species were fixed , there would be no problem , but evolutionary processes cause species to change continually , and to grade into one another . A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring , typically by sexual reproduction . While this definition is often adequate , when looked at more closely it is problematic . For example , with hybridisation , in a species complex of hundreds of similar microspecies , or in a ring species , the boundaries between closely related species become unclear . Among organisms that reproduce only asexually , the concept of a reproductive species breaks down , and each clone is potentially a microspecies . Problems also arise when dealing with fossils , since reproduction can not be examined ; the concept of the chronospecies is therefore used in palaeontology . Other ways of defining species include their karyotype , DNA sequence , morphology , behaviour or ecological niche ."},{"query":"when was the mission san antonio de valero built","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Alamo Mission in San Antonio is commonly called The Alamo and was originally known as Misión San Antonio de Valero .

The name comes from the idea that on a graph of concentration versus time , the line forms a U-shaped trough at the lowest region , before a new dose sends it higher again . The usual criterion is concentration in the blood serum , although in some instances local concentration within tissues is relevant . It is pharmacokinetically normal that with every passing minute and hour , the drug molecules are being metabolized or cleared by the body , so the concentration of drug that remains available is dropping . In a medicine that is administered periodically , the trough level should be measured just before the administration of the next dose in order to avoid overdosing . A trough level is contrasted with a \`\` peak level '' , which is the highest level of the medicine in the body , and the \`\` average level '' , which is the mean level over time . It helps in therapeutic drug monitoring . It is widely used in clinical trials for newer medicines for its therapeutic effectiveness and safety ."},{"query":"who had the best strike rate among batsmen who scored over 200 runs in the world cup","short_answer":"","abstract":"A double century ( 200 runs or more ) in One Day Internationals ( ODIs ) has been scored on 8 occasions by 6 different batsmen / women from four of the twelve Test - cricket playing nations .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic ."},{"query":"what type of person is the nurse in romeo and juliet","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Nurse is a major character in William Shakespeare 's classic drama Romeo and Juliet .

Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases . In the first phase , the Archidamian War , Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica , while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire . This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese . In 415 BC , Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily ; the attack failed disastrously , with the destruction of the entire force , in 413 BC . This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy . The destruction of Athens ' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war , and Athens surrendered in the following year .

Formally , a wider study includes water falling as ice crystals , i.e. hail , sleet , snow ( parts of the hydrological cycle known as precipitation ) . The aim of rainfall climatology is to measure , understand and predict rain distribution across different regions of planet Earth , a factor of air pressure , humidity , topography , cloud type and raindrop size , via direct measurement and remote sensing data acquisition . Current technologies accurately predict rainfall 3 -- 4 days in advance using numerical weather prediction . Geostationary orbiting satellites gather IR and visual wavelength data to measure realtime localised rainfall by estimating cloud albedo , water content , and the corresponding probability of rain . Geographic distribution of rain is largely governed by climate type , topography and habitat humidity . In mountainous areas , heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation . On the leeward side of mountains , desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by compressional heating . The movement of the monsoon trough , or intertropical convergence zone , brings rainy seasons to savannah climes . The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall , both in amounts and intensity , downwind of cities . Global warming may also cause changes in the precipitation pattern globally , including wetter conditions at high latitudes and in some wet tropical areas , and drier conditions in parts of the subtropics and middle latitudes . Precipitation is a major component of the water cycle , and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the planet . Approximately 505,000 cubic kilometres ( 121,000 cu mi ) of water falls as precipitation each year ; 398,000 cubic kilometres ( 95,000 cu mi ) of it over the oceans . Given the Earth 's surface area , that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is 990 millimetres ( 39 in ) . Climate classification systems such as the Köppen climate classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes ."},{"query":"what is the first basic process in the light reaction of photosynthesis","short_answer":"","abstract":"Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms ' activities ( energy transformation ) .

Other cells in the stomach produce bicarbonate , a base , to buffer the fluid , ensuring that it does not become too acidic .

Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year . Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4 -- 9 cm / year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm / year ."},{"query":"where was the first high level language operating system created","short_answer":"at IBM","abstract":"The first high - level programming language was Plankalkül , created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945 .
