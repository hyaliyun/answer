The treaty included the governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam), and the United States, as well as the Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG) that represented indigenous South Vietnamese revolutionaries. It ended direct U.S. military combat, and temporarily stopped the fighting between North and South Vietnam. However, the agreement was not ratified by the United States Senate.[1][2]\\r\\nThe negotiations that led to the accord began in 1968, after various lengthy delays. As a result of the accord, the International Control Commission (ICC) was replaced by the International Commission of Control and Supervision (ICCS) to fulfill the agreement. The main negotiators of the agreement were United States National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and North Vietnamese politburo member L ??c Th?; the two men were awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts, although L ??c Th? refused to accept it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe document began with the statement that \\"the United States and all other countries respect the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam as recognized by the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Vietnam\\". The inclusion of this provision was a victory for the communist side Saigon and the Vietcongtowards a political settlement that would allow the South Vietnamese people to \\"decide themselves the political future of South Viet-Nam through genuinely free and democratic general elections under international supervision.\\"\\r\\nFollowing the success of anti-war candidate Eugene McCarthy in the New Hampshire primary, in March 1968 U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson halted bombing operations over the northern portion of the North Vietnam (Operation Rolling Thunder), in order to encourage Hanoi (the perceived locus of the insurgency) to begin negotiations. Shortly thereafter, Hanoi agreed to discuss a complete halt of the bombing, and a date was set for representatives of both parties to meet in Paris, France. The sides first met on May 10, with the delegations headed by Xuan Thu?, who would remain the official leader of the North Vietnamese delegation throughout the process, and U.S. ambassador-at-large W. Averell Harriman.\\r\\nFor five months, the negotiations stalled as North Vietnam demanded that all bombing of North Vietnam be stopped, while the U.S. side demanded that North Vietnam agree to a reciprocal de-escalation in South Vietnam; it was not until October 31 that Johnson agreed to end the air strikes and serious negotiations could begin.\\r\\nOne of the largest hurdles to effective negotiation was the fact that North Vietnam and its ally in South Vietnam, the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, or Viet Cong), refused to recognize the government of South Vietnam; with equal persistence, the government in Saigon refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the NLF. Harriman resolved this dispute by developing a system by which North Vietnam and U.S. would be the named parties; NLF officials could join the North Vietnam team without being recognized by South Vietnam, while Saigon's representatives joined their U.S. allies.\\r\\nA similar debate concerned the shape of the table to be used at the conference. The North favored a circular table, in which all parties, including NLF representatives, would appear to be \\"equal\\"' in importance. The South Vietnamese argued that only a rectangular table was acceptable, for only a rectangle could show two distinct sides to the conflict. Eventually a compromise was reached, in which representatives of the northern and southern governments would sit at a circular table, with members representing all other parties sitting at individual square tables around them.\\r\\nBryce Harlow, a former White House staff member in the Eisenhower administration, claimed to have \\"a double agent working in the White House....I kept Nixon informed.\\" Harlow and Henry Kissinger (who was friendly with both campaigns and guaranteed a job in either a Humphrey or Nixon administration in the upcoming election) separately predicted Johnson's \\"bombing halt\\". Democratic senator George Smathers informed President Johnson that \\"the word is out that we are making an effort to throw the election to Humphrey. Nixon has been told of it\\".[4]\\r\\nAccording to presidential historian Robert Dallek, Kissinger's advice \\"rested not on special knowledge of decision making at the White House but on an astute analyst's insight into what was happening.\\" CIA intelligence analyst William Bundy stated that Kissinger obtained \\"no useful inside information\\" from his trip to Paris, and \\"almost any experienced Hanoi watcher might have come to the same conclusion\\". While Kissinger may have \\"hinted that his advice was based on contacts with the Paris delegation,\\" this sort of \\"self-promotion...is at worst a minor and not uncommon practice, quite different from getting and reporting real secrets.\\"[4]\\r\\nNixon asked the prominent Asian-American politician Anna Chennault to be his \\"channel to Mr. Thieu\\"; Chennault agreed and periodically reported to John Mitchell that Thieu had no intention of attending a peace conference. On November 2, Chennault informed the South Vietnamese ambassador: \\"I have just heard from my boss in Albuquerque who says his boss [Nixon] is going to win. And you tell your boss [Thieu] to hold on a while longer.\\"[5] In response, President Johnson ordered the wire-tapping of members of the Nixon campaign.[6][7] Dallek wrote that Nixon's efforts \\"probably made no difference\\" because Thieu was unwilling to attend the talks and there was little chance of an agreement being reached before the election; however, his use of information provided by Harlow and Kissinger was morally questionable, and vice president Hubert Humphrey's decision not to make Nixon's actions public was \\"an uncommon act of political decency.\\"[8]\\r\\nAfter winning the 1968 presidential election, Richard Nixon became president of the U.S. in January 1969. He then replaced U.S. ambassador Harriman with Henry Cabot Lodge?Jr., who was later replaced by David Bruce. Also that year, the NLF set up a Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG) to gain government status at the talks. However, the primary negotiations that led to the agreement did not occur at the Peace Conference at all, but were carried out during secret negotiations between Kissinger and L ??c Th?, which began on August 4, 1969.\\r\\nNorth Vietnam insisted for three years that the agreement could not be concluded unless the United States agreed to remove South Vietnamese President Nguy?n V?n Thi?u from power and replace him with someone more acceptable to Hanoi. Nixon and Kissinger were unwilling to sign an agreement to overthrow a government the NLF had failed to overthrow by force of arms, though the extent of North Vietnamese demands is contested. Historian Marilyn B. Young, whose expertise is in American foreign relations, contends that the contents of Hanoi's proposal were systematically distorted from their original plea to permit Thi?u's replacement, to what Kissinger propagated as a demand for his overthrow.[9]\\r\\nOn May 8, 1972, President Nixon made a major concession to North Vietnam by announcing that the U.S. would accept a cease-fire in place as a precondition for its military withdrawal. In other words, the U.S. would withdraw its forces from South Vietnam without North Vietnam doing the same. The concession broke a deadlock and resulted in progress in the talks over the next few months.[10]\\r\\nThe final major breakthrough came on October 8, 1972. Prior to this, North Vietnam had been disappointed by the results of its Nguyen Hue Offensive (known in the West as the Easter Offensive), which had resulted in the United States countering with \\"Operation Linebacker,\\" a significant air bombing campaign that blunted the North's drive in the South as well as inflicting damage in the North. Also, they feared increased isolation if Nixon's efforts at dtente significantly improved U.S. relations with the chief communist powers, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, who were backing the North Vietnamese military effort. In a meeting with Kissinger, Th? significantly modified his bargaining line, allowing that the Saigon government could remain in power and that negotiations between the two South Vietnamese parties could develop a final settlement. Within 10 days the secret talks drew up a final draft. Kissinger held a press conference in Washington during which he announced that \\"peace is at hand.\\"\\r\\nWhen Thi?u, who had not even been informed of the secret negotiations, was presented with the draft of the new agreement, he was furious with Kissinger and Nixon (who were perfectly aware of South Vietnam's negotiating position) and refused to accept it without significant changes. He then made several public radio addresses, claiming that the proposed agreement was worse than it actually was. Hanoi was flabbergasted, believing that it had been duped into a propaganda ploy by Kissinger. On October 26, Radio Hanoi broadcast key details of the draft agreement.\\r\\nHowever, as U.S. casualties had mounted throughout the conflict since 1965, American domestic support for the war had deteriorated, and by the fall of 1972 there was major pressure on the Nixon administration to withdraw from the war. Consequently, the U.S. brought great diplomatic pressure upon their South Vietnamese ally to sign the peace treaty even if the concessions Thi?u wanted could not be achieved. Nixon pledged to provide continued substantial aid to South Vietnam, and given his recent landslide victory in the presidential election, it seemed possible that he would be able to follow through on that pledge. To demonstrate his seriousness to Thi?u, Nixon ordered the heavy Operation Linebacker?II bombings of North Vietnam in December 1972. Nixon also attempted to bolster South Vietnam's military forces by ordering that large quantities of U.S. military material and equipment be given to South Vietnam from May to December 1972 under Operations Enhance and Enhance Plus.[11] These operations were also designed to keep North Vietnam at the negotiating table and to prevent them from abandoning negotiations and seeking total victory. When the North Vietnamese government agreed to resume \\"technical\\" discussions with the United States, Nixon ordered a halt to bombings north of the 20th parallel on December 30. With the U.S. committed to disengagement (and after threats from Nixon that South Vietnam would be abandoned if he did not agree), Thi?u had little choice but to accede.\\r\\nOn January 15, 1973, President Nixon announced a suspension of offensive actions against North Vietnam. Kissinger and Th? met again on January 23 and signed off on a treaty that was basically identical to the draft of three months earlier. The agreement was signed by the leaders of the official delegations on January 27, 1973, at the Hotel Majestic in Paris, France.\\r\\nThe Paris Peace Accords effectively removed the U.S. from the conflict in Vietnam. However, the agreement's provisions were routinely flouted by both the North Vietnamese and the Saigon government, eliciting no response from the United States, and ultimately resulting in the communists enlarging the area under their control by the end of 1973. North Vietnamese military forces gradually built up their military infrastructure in the areas they controlled and two years later were in a position to launch the successful offensive that ended South Vietnam's status as an independent country.\\r\\nNixon had secretly promised Thi?u that he would use airpower to support the Saigon government should it be necessary. During his confirmation hearings in June 1973, Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger was sharply criticized by some senators after he stated that he would recommend resumption of U.S. bombing in North Vietnam if North Vietnam launched a major offensive against South Vietnam, but by August 15, 1973, 95% of American troops and their allies had left Vietnam (both North and South) as well as Cambodia and Laos under the Case-Church Amendment. The amendment, which was approved by the U.S. Congress in June 1973, prohibited further U.S. military activity in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia unless the president secured Congressional approval in advance. However, during this time, Nixon was being driven from office due to the Watergate scandal, which led to his resignation in 1974. When the North Vietnamese began their final offensive early in 1975, U.S. Congress refused to appropriate additional military assistance for South Vietnam, citing strong opposition to the war by Americans and the loss of American equipment to the North by retreating Southern forces. Thi?u subsequently resigned, accusing the U.S. of betrayal in a TV and radio address:\\r\\nAt the time of the peace agreement the United States agreed to replace equipment on a one-by-one basis. But the United States did not keep its word. Is an American's word reliable these days? The United States did not keep its promise to help us fight for freedom and it was in the same fight that the United States lost 50,000 of its young men.[13]\\r\\nSaigon fell to the North Vietnamese army supported by Viet Cong units on April 30, 1975. Schlesinger had announced early in the morning of April 29 the beginning of Operation Frequent Wind, which entailed the evacuation of the last U.S. diplomatic, military and civilian personnel from Saigon via helicopter, which was completed in the early morning hours of April 30. Not only did North Vietnam conquer South Vietnam, but the communists were also victorious in Cambodia when the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh on April 17, as were the Pathet Lao in Laos successful in capturing Vientiane on December 2. Like Saigon, U.S. civilian and military personnel were evacuated from Phnom Penh, U.S. diplomatic presence in Vientiane was significantly downgraded, and the number of remaining U.S. personnel was severely reduced.","input":"Who was the peace negotiator for the north vietnamese?"},{"output":"iron ore","context":"","input":"What are some natural resources found in brazil?"},{"output":"January 6, 1975","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel of Fortune (often known simply as Wheel[note 1]) is an American television game show created by Merv Griffin. The show features a competition in which contestants solve word puzzles, similar to those used in Hangman, to win cash and prizes determined by spinning a giant carnival wheel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel originally aired as a daytime series on NBC from January 6, 1975, to June 30, 1989. After some changes were made to its format, the daytime series moved to CBS from July 17, 1989, to January 11, 1991. It then returned to NBC from January 14, 1991, until it was cancelled on September 20, 1991. The popularity of the daytime series led to a nightly syndicated edition being developed, which premiered on September 19, 1983, and has aired continuously since.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe network version was originally hosted by Chuck Woolery and Susan Stafford, with Charlie O'Donnell as its announcer. O'Donnell left in 1980 and was replaced by Jack Clark. After Clark's death in 1988, M. G. Kelly took over briefly as announcer until O'Donnell returned in 1989. O'Donnell remained on the network version until its cancellation, and continued to announce on the syndicated show until his death in 2010, when Jim Thornton succeeded him. Woolery left in 1981, and was replaced by Pat Sajak. Sajak left the network version in January 1989 to host his own late-night talk show, and was replaced on that version by Rolf Benirschke. Bob Goen replaced Benirschke when the network show moved to CBS, then remained as host until the network show was canceled altogether. Stafford left in 1982, and was replaced by Vanna White, who remained on the network show for the rest of its run. The syndicated version has been hosted continuously by Sajak and White since its inception.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel of Fortune ranks as the longest-running syndicated game show in the United States, with over 6,000 episodes aired. TV Guide named it the \\"top-rated syndicated series\\" in a 2008 article,[4] and in 2013, the magazine ranked it at No.?2 in its list of the 60 greatest game shows ever.[5] The program has also come to gain a worldwide following with sixty international adaptations. The syndicated series' 35th season premiered on September 11, 2017.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe core game is based on Hangman. Each round has a category and a blank word puzzle, with each blank representing a letter in the answer, and punctuation revealed as needed.[7] Most puzzles are straightforward figures of speech that fit within a mostly static list of categories, and this list has evolved over the course of the series. Crossword puzzles were added to the rotation in 2016. In such rounds, a clue bonding the words in the puzzle is given instead of a traditional category, and contestants win by solving all the words in the crossword.[8] The titular Wheel of Fortune is a roulette-style wheel mechanism with 24 spaces, most of which are labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $900, plus a top dollar value: $2,500 in round 1, $3,500 in rounds 2 and 3, and $5,000 for round 4 and any subsequent rounds. The wheel also features two Bankrupt wedges and one Lose a Turn, both of which forfeit the contestant's turn, with the former also eliminating any cash or prizes the contestant has accumulated within the round.[9] Each game features three contestants, or occasionally, three two-contestant teams positioned behind a single scoreboard with its own flipper. The left scoreboard from the viewer's perspective is colored red, the center yellow, and the right blue, with the contestants' positions determined by a random selection prior to taping.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nA contestant spins the wheel to determine a dollar value and guess a consonant.[note 2]\\r\\nCalling a correct letter earns the value before the corresponding flipper, multiplied by the number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle.[12] Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed.[9] Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first three rounds, the wheel contains a Wild Card and a Gift Tag, while two ? Car tags are present in rounds two and three only (except on episodes with two-player teams). The Wild Card may be used to call an additional consonant after any turn (for the amount that the contestant has just spun) or taken to the bonus round to call an extra consonant there. The Gift Tag offers either a $1,000 credit toward purchases from, or $1,000 in cash courtesy of, the sponsoring company, and the ? Car tags award a car if the contestant wins the round(s) in which he or she claims both. Unlike the other tags, the ? Car tags are replaced in subsequent rounds unless the car is won. A special wedge in the first two rounds awards a prize which is described by the announcer if won. All of the tags and the prize wedge are located over the $500 wedges, so calling a letter that appears in the puzzle when landed upon awards both the tag/wedge and $500 per every occurrence of that letter in the puzzle. The first three rounds also contain a special wedge which, if won and taken to the bonus round, offers an opportunity to play that round for $1,000,000. A contestant must solve the puzzle in order to keep any cash, prizes, or extras accumulated during that round except for the Wild Card, which is kept until the contestant either loses it to Bankrupt or uses it. Bankrupt does not affect score from previous rounds, but it does take away the Wild Card, individual ? Car tags, and/or million dollar wedge if any was claimed in a previous round. Contestants who solve a round for less than $1,000 in cash and prizes ($2,000 on weeks with two-contestant teams) have their scores increased to that amount.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach game also features three toss-up puzzles, which reveal the puzzle one random letter at a time, and award cash to whoever rings in with the right answer. The first determines who is interviewed first by the host, the second determines who starts round 1, and the third determines who starts round 4. Respectively, the toss-ups are valued at $1,000, $2,000, and $3,000. Contestants may only ring in once for each toss-up puzzle, and no cash is awarded if all three contestants fail to solve the puzzle, or if the last letter of the puzzle is revealed. In this case, the contestant in the position closest to the host is interviewed first or starts the round. In addition to these, each game has a minimum of four rounds, with more played if time permits.[12] Rounds 2 and 3 are respectively started by the next two contestants clockwise from the contestant who began round 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nRound 2 features two \\"mystery wedges\\". Calling a correct letter after landing upon one offers the contestant the chance to accept its face value of $1,000 per letter, or forfeit that amount to flip over the wedge and see whether its reverse side contains a $10,000 cash prize or Bankrupt. Once either mystery wedge is flipped over, the other becomes a standard $1,000 space and cannot be flipped. Round 3 is a prize puzzle, which offers a prize (usually a trip) to the contestant who solves it. Starting with season 31 in 2013, an \\"Express\\" wedge is also placed on the wheel in round 3. A contestant who lands on this space and calls a consonant that appears in the puzzle receives $1,000 per appearance. The contestant can then either \\"pass\\" and continue the round normally, or \\"play\\" and keep calling consonants for $1,000 each (without spinning) and buying vowels for $250. The Express play ends when the contestant either calls an incorrect letter (which has the same effect as landing on a Bankrupt wedge) or solves the puzzle.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final round is always played at least in part in a \\"speed-up\\" format, in which the host spins the wheel to determine the value of each consonant, with $1,000 being added to the value on which the wheel stops before the red contestant's arrow. Vowels do not add or deduct money from the contestants' scores in the speed-up round. The contestant in control calls one letter, and if it appears in the puzzle, the contestant is given three seconds to attempt to solve.[note 3] Play proceeds clockwise, starting with the contestant who was in control at the time of the final spin, until the puzzle is solved. The three-second timer does not begin until the hostess has revealed all instances of a called letter and moved aside from the puzzle board, and the contestant may offer multiple guesses on his/her turn. After the speed-up round, the total winnings of the three contestants are compared. The contestant with the highest total winnings wins the game and advances to the bonus round. Contestants who fail to earn any cash or prizes in the game are awarded a consolation prize of $1,000 (or $2,000 on weeks with two-contestant teams).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a tie for first place occurs after the speed-up round, an additional toss-up puzzle is played between the tied contestants. The contestant who solves the toss-up puzzle wins $1,000[14] and advances to the bonus round.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the bonus round begins, the winning contestant chooses one of three categories for his or her puzzle (prior to season 35, the puzzle and category were predetermined). After doing so, the contestant spins a smaller wheel with 24 envelopes to determine the prize. He or she is then shown a puzzle in the chosen category, and every instance of R, S, T, L, N, and E is revealed. The contestant provides three more consonants (four if he/she is holding the Wild Card) and one more vowel, then has 10 seconds to solve the puzzle after his or her other letters (if any) are revealed. The contestant may make as many guesses as necessary, so long as the contestant begins the correct answer before time expires. Whether or not the contestant solves the puzzle, the host opens the envelope at the end of the round to reveal the prize at stake. Prizes in the bonus round include various cash amounts (with the lowest being the season number multiplied by $1,000), a vehicle (or two vehicles during weeks with two-contestant teams), and a top prize of $100,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the contestant has the Million Dollar Wedge, the $100,000 envelope is replaced with a $1,000,000 envelope. The $1,000,000 prize has been awarded three times: to Michelle Loewenstein (on the episode that aired October 14, 2008),[15] to Autumn Erhard (May 30, 2013),[16] and to Sarah Manchester (September 17, 2014).[17] Contestants who win the $1,000,000 may receive it in installments over 20 years, or in a lump sum of that amount's present value.[18] At the end of the Bonus Round, Sajak will reveal where the $1,000,000 envelope was on the prize wheel if the contestant failed to land on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, after winning a round, contestants spent their winnings on prizes that were presented onstage. At any time during a shopping round, most often if the contestant did not have enough left to buy another prize,[19] a contestant could choose to put his or her winnings on a gift certificate, or he or she could put the winnings \\"on account\\" for use in a later shopping round. However, a contestant lost any money on account by landing on Bankrupt or failing to claim it by not winning subsequent rounds.[9] The shopping element was eliminated from the syndicated version on the episode that aired October 5, 1987,[20] both to speed up gameplay and to alleviate the taxes paid by contestants.[12] However, the network version continued to use the shopping element until the end of its first NBC run on June 30, 1989.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the introduction of toss-up puzzles at the start of the 18th syndicated season in 2000,[22] the contestant at the red arrow always started round 1, with the next contestant clockwise starting each subsequent round.[23] In addition, if a tie for first place occurred, an additional speed-up round was played between the tied contestants for the right to go to the bonus round. The wheel formerly featured a Free Spin wedge, which automatically awarded a token that the contestant could turn in after a lost turn to keep control of the wheel.[24] It was replaced in 1989 with a single Free Spin token placed over a selected cash wedge. Free Spin was retired, and Free Play introduced, at the start of the 27th syndicated season in 2009.[25] Between September 16, 1996[26] and the end of season 30 in 2013, the show featured a progressive Jackpot wedge, which had been in several different rounds in its history.[note 4] The jackpot started at $5,000 and had the value of every spin within the round added to it. To claim the jackpot, a contestant had to land on the wedge, call a correct letter, and solve the puzzle all in the same turn. In later years, it also offered $500 per correct letter and $500 to the jackpot, regardless of whether or not it was won in that turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe network version allowed champions to appear for up to five days originally, which was later reduced to three. The syndicated version, which originally retired contestants after one episode, adopted the three-day champion rule at the start of the seventh season in 1989.[29] In 1996, this was changed to have the top three winners from the week's first four shows returned to compete in the \\"Friday Finals\\". When the jackpot wedge was introduced, it began at $10,000 instead of $5,000 on Fridays. The rules allowing returning champions were eliminated permanently beginning with the syndicated episode aired September 21, 1998, and contestants appear only on a single episode, reverting to the pre-1989 rules.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore December 1981, the show did not feature a bonus round.[9] Under the bonus round's original rules, no letters were provided automatically. The contestant asked for five consonants and a vowel, and then had fifteen seconds to attempt solving the puzzle. Also, bonus prizes were selected by the contestant at the start of the round.[31] The current time limit and rules for letter selection were introduced on October 3, 1988.[32] Starting on September 4, 1989, the first episode of the seventh syndicated season, bonus prizes were selected by the contestant choosing from one of five envelopes labeled W, H, E, E, and L. One prize was always $25,000 in cash, and the rest were changed weekly. Any prize that was won was taken out of rotation for the rest of the week.[29] During seasons 16 through 18 (1998ÿ2001), the $25,000 remained in-place the entire week of shows regardless if it was won. At the start of season 19 on September 3, 2001, there were three car envelopes and two $25,000 envelopes, which were available the entire week of shows.[33] These envelopes were replaced with the bonus wheel on October 22, 2001.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nMerv Griffin conceived Wheel of Fortune just as the original version of Jeopardy!, another show he had created, was ending its 11-year run on NBC with Art Fleming as its host. Griffin decided to create a Hangman-style game after recalling long car trips as a child, on which he and his sister played Hangman. After he discussed the idea with Merv Griffin Enterprises' staff, they thought that the idea would work as a game show if it had a \\"hook\\". He decided to add a roulette-style wheel because he was always \\"drawn to\\" such wheels when he saw them in casinos. He and MGE's then-president Murray Schwartz consulted an executive of Caesars Palace to find out how to build such a wheel.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Griffin pitched the idea for the show to Lin Bolen, then the head of NBC's daytime programming division, she approved, but wanted the show to have more glamour to attract the female audience. She suggested that Griffin incorporate a shopping element into the gameplay, and so, in 1973, he created a pilot episode titled Shopper's Bazaar, with Chuck Woolery as host and Mike Lawrence as announcer. The pilot started with the three contestants being introduced individually, with Lawrence describing the prizes that they chose to play for. The main game was played to four rounds, with the values on the wheel wedges increasing after the second round. Unlike the show it evolved into, Shopper's Bazaar had a vertically mounted wheel,[36] which was spun automatically rather than by the contestants. This wheel lacked the Bankrupt wedge and featured a wedge where a contestant could call a vowel for free, as well as a \\"Your Own Clue\\" wedge that allowed contestants to pick up a rotary telephone and hear a private clue about the puzzle. At the end of the game, the highest-scoring contestant played a bonus round called the \\"Shopper's Special\\" where all the vowels in the puzzle were already there, and the contestant had 30 seconds to call out consonants in the puzzle.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdd Byrnes, an actor from 77 Sunset Strip, served as host for the second and third pilots, both titled Wheel of Fortune.[37] These pilots were directed by Marty Pasetta, who gave the show a \\"Vegas\\" feel that more closely resembled the look and feel that the actual show ended up having, a wheel that was now spun by the contestants themselves, and a lighted mechanical puzzle board with letters that were now manually turnable. Showcase prizes on these pilots were located behind the puzzle board, and during shopping segments a list of prizes and their price values scrolled on the right of the screen. By the time production began in December 1974, Woolery was selected to host, the choice being made by Griffin after he reportedly heard Byrnes reciting \\"A-E-I-O-U\\" to himself in an effort to remember the vowels.[37] Susan Stafford turned the letters on Byrnes' pilot episodes, a role that she also held when the show was picked up as a series.[35][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original host of Wheel of Fortune was Chuck Woolery, who hosted the series from its 1975 premiere[9][39] until December 25, 1981, save for one week in August 1980 when Alex Trebek hosted in his place. Woolery's departure came over a salary dispute with show creator Merv Griffin, and his contract was not renewed.[12][40] On December 28, 1981, Pat Sajak made his debut as the host of Wheel.[41] Griffin said that he chose Sajak for his \\"odd\\" sense of humor. NBC president and CEO Fred Silverman objected as he felt Sajak, who at the time of his hiring was the weatherman for KNBC-TV, was \\"too local\\" for a national audience. Griffin countered by telling Silverman he would stop production if Sajak was not allowed to become host, and Silverman acquiesced.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nSajak hosted the daytime series until January 9, 1989, when he left to host a late-night talk show for CBS. Rolf Benirschke, a former placekicker in the National Football League, was chosen as his replacement and hosted for a little more than five months. Benirschke's term as host came to an end due to NBC's cancellation of the daytime Wheel after fourteen years, with its final episode airing on June 30, 1989.[9] When the newly formatted daytime series returned on CBS on July 17, 1989, Bob Goen became its host. The daytime program continued for a year and a half on CBS, then returned to NBC on January 14, 1991 and continued until September 20, 1991 when it was cancelled for a second and final time.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan Stafford was the original hostess, serving in that role from the premiere until October 1982. Stafford was absent for two extended periods, once in 1977 after fracturing two vertebrae in her back and once in 1979 after an automobile accident.[9][43] During these two extended absences, former Miss USA Summer Bartholomew was Stafford's most frequent substitute, with model Cynthia Washington and comedian Arte Johnson also filling in for Stafford.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Stafford left to become a humanitarian worker,[35] over two hundred applicants signed up for a nationwide search to be her replacement.[45] Griffin eventually narrowed the list to three finalists, which consisted of Summer Bartholomew, former Playboy centerfold Vicki McCarty, and Vanna White.[46] Griffin gave each of the three women an opportunity to win the job by putting them in a rotation for several weeks after Stafford's departure.[12] In December 1982, Griffin named White as Stafford's successor, saying that he felt she was capable of activating the puzzle board letters (which is the primary role of the Wheel hostess) better than anyone else who had auditioned.[47] White became highly popular among the young female demographic,[48] and also gained a fanbase of adults interested in her daily wardrobe, in a phenomenon that has been referred to as \\"Vannamania\\".[45] White remained on the daytime series for the rest of the time it was on the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nSajak and White have starred on the syndicated version continuously as host and hostess, respectively, since it began, except for very limited occasions. During two weeks in January 1991, Tricia Gist, the girlfriend and future wife of Griffin's son Tony, filled in for White when she and her new husband, restaurateur George San Pietro, were honeymooning.[49] Gist returned for the week of episodes airing March 11 through 15, 1991, because White had a cold at the time of taping.[50] On an episode in November 1996, when Sajak proved unable to host the bonus round segment because of laryngitis, he and White traded places for that segment.[51][52] On the March 4, 1997 episode, Rosie O'Donnell co-hosted the third round with White after O'Donnell's name was used in a puzzle.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 1, 1997, Sajak and Alex Trebek traded jobs for the day. Sajak hosted that day's edition of Jeopardy! in place of Trebek,[54] who presided over a special two-contestant Wheel celebrity match between Sajak and White, who were playing for the Boy Scouts of America and the American Cancer Society, respectively;[55] Lesly Sajak, Pat's wife, was the guest hostess for the day.[54] In January and February 2011, the show held a \\"Vanna for a Day\\" contest in which home viewers submitted video auditions to take White's place for one episode, with the winner determined by a poll on the show's website;[56] the winner of this contest, Katie Cantrell of Wooster, Ohio (a student at the Savannah College of Art and Design),[57] took White's place for the second and third rounds on the episode that aired March 24, 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie O'Donnell was the program's first and longest tenured announcer. In 1980, NBC was discussing cancelling Wheel and O'Donnell agreed to take the position as announcer on The Toni Tennille Show. The network decided against the cancellation but O'Donnell decided to honor his commitment and left the series.[58] His replacement was Jack Clark, who added the syndicated series to his responsibilities when it premiered in 1983 and announced for both series until his death in July 1988.[59] Los Angeles radio personality M. G. Kelly was Clark's replacement, starting on the daytime series in August 1988 and on the syndicated series when its new season launched a month later.[60] Kelly held these positions until O'Donnell was able to return to the announcer position, doing so after his duties with Barris Industries came to an end at the end of the 1988ÿ89 television season.[9] O'Donnell remained with the series until shortly before his death in November 2010.[61] Don Pardo, Don Morrow, and Johnny Gilbert have occasionally served as substitute announcers.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter O'Donnell's death, the producers sought a permanent replacement, and a series of substitutes filled out the rest of the season, including Gilbert, John Cramer, Joe Cipriano, Rich Fields, Lora Cain and Jim Thornton. For the show's twenty-ninth season, which began in 2011, Thornton was chosen to be the new announcer for Wheel, and has been with the show ever since.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel of Fortune typically employs a total of 100 in-house production personnel, with 60 to 100 local staff joining them for those episodes that are taped on location.[10] Griffin was the executive producer of the network version throughout its entire run, and served as the syndicated version's executive producer until his retirement in 2000. Since 1999, the title of executive producer has been held by Harry Friedman, who had shared his title with Griffin for his first year,[63] and had earlier served as a producer starting in 1995.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Rhinehart was the program's first producer, but departed in August 1976 to become NBC's West Coast Daytime Program Development Director. Afterwards, his co-producer, Nancy Jones, was promoted to sole producer, and served as such until 1995, when Friedman succeeded her.[3] In the 15th syndicated season in 1997, Karen Griffith and Steve Schwartz joined Friedman as producers. They were later promoted to supervising producers, with Amanda Stern occupying Griffith's and Schwartz's former position.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show's original director was Jeff Goldstein, who was succeeded by Dick Carson (a brother of Johnny Carson) in 1978.[9] Mark Corwin, who had served as associate director under Carson, took over for him upon his retirement at the end of the 1998ÿ99 season, and served as such until he himself died in July 2013 (although episodes already taped before his death continued airing until late 2013).[64] Jeopardy! director Kevin McCarthy,[65] Corwin's associate director Bob Cisneros,[66] and Wheel and Jeopardy! technical director Robert Ennis[67] filled in at various points until Cisneros became full-time director in November 2013.[68] Ennis returned as guest director for the weeks airing October 13 through 17 and November 17 through 21, 2014, as Cisneros was recovering from neck surgery at the time of taping.[69][70] With the start of the 33rd season on September 14, 2015, Ennis was promoted to full-time director.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel of Fortune is owned by Sony Pictures Television (previously known as Columbia TriStar Television, the successor company to original producer Merv Griffin Enterprises).[72] The production company and copyright holder of all episodes to date is Califon Productions, Inc., which like SPT has Sony Pictures for its active registered agent, and whose name comes from a New Jersey town where Griffin once owned a farm.[73] The rights to distribute the show worldwide are owned by CBS Television Distribution, into which original distributor King World Productions was folded in 2007.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show was originally taped in Studio 4 at NBC Studios in Burbank.[75] Upon NBC's 1989 cancellation of the network series, production moved to Studio 33 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles, where it remained until 1995.[76] Since then, the show has occupied Stage 11 at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City.[77] Some episodes are also recorded on location, a tradition which began with two weeks of episodes taped at Radio City Music Hall in late 1988.[78] Recording sessions usually last for five or six episodes in one day.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious changes have been made to the basic set since the syndicated version's premiere in 1983. In 1996, a large video display was added center stage, which was then upgraded in 2003 as the show began the transition into high-definition broadcasting. In the mid-1990s, the show began a long-standing tradition of nearly every week coming with its own unique theme. As a result, in addition to its generic design, the set also uses many alternate designs, which are unique to specific weekly sets of themed programs. The most recent set design was conceived by production designer Renee Hoss-Johnson, with later modifications by Jody Vaclav.[1] Previous set designers included Ed Flesh[79] and Dick Stiles.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first pilot used a vertically mounted wheel which was often difficult to see on-screen. Flesh, who also designed the sets for The $25,000 Pyramid and Jeopardy!, designed the wheel mechanism. Originally made mostly of paint and cardboard,[79] the modern wheel mechanism is framed on a steel tube surrounded with Plexiglas and more than 200 lighting instruments, and is held by a stainless steel shaft with roller bearings. Altogether, the wheel weighs approximately 2,400 pounds (1,100?kg).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show's original puzzle board had three rows of 13 manually operated trilons, for a total of 39 spaces. On December 21, 1981, a larger board with 48 trilons in four rows (11, 13, 13 and 11 trilons) was adopted. This board was surrounded by a double-arched border of lights which flashed at the beginning and end of the round. Each trilon had three sides: a green side to represent spaces not used by the puzzle, a blank side to indicate a letter that had not been revealed, and a side with a letter on it.[23] While the viewer saw a seamless transition to the next puzzle, with these older boards in segments where more than one puzzle was present, a stop-down of taping took place during which the board was wheeled offstage and the new puzzle loaded in by hand out of sight of the contestants. On February 24, 1997, the show introduced a computerized puzzle board composed of 52 touch-activated monitors in four rows (12 on the top and bottom rows, 14 in the middle two).[10] To illuminate a letter during regular gameplay, the hostess touches the right edge of the monitor to reveal it.[80] The computerized board obviated the stop-downs, allowing tapings to finish quicker at a lower cost to the production company.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough not typically seen by viewers, the set also includes a used letter board that shows contestants which letters are remaining in play, a scoreboard that is visible from the contestants' perspective, and a countdown clock.[81][82] The used letter board is also used during the bonus round, and in at least one case, helped the contestant to see unused letters to solve a difficult puzzle.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlan Thicke composed the show's original theme, which was titled \\"Big Wheels\\". In 1983, it was replaced by Griffin's own composition, \\"Changing Keys\\",[84] to allow him to derive royalties from that composition's use on both the network and syndicated versions. Steve Kaplan became music director starting with the premiere of the 15th syndicated season in 1997, and continued to serve as such until he was killed when the Cessna 421C Golden Eagle he was piloting crashed into a home in Claremont, California, in December 2003.[85][86][87] His initial theme was a remix of \\"Changing Keys\\", but by the 18th syndicated season (2000ÿ01), he had replaced it with a composition of his own, which was titled \\"Happy Wheels\\".[88] Since 2006, music direction has been handled by Frankie Blue and John Hoke.[1] Themes they have written for the show include a remix of \\"Happy Wheels\\" and an original rock-based composition.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to \\"Changing Keys\\", Griffin also composed various incidental music cues for the syndicated version which were used for announcements of prizes in the show's early years. Among them were \\"Frisco Disco\\" (earlier the closing theme for a revival of Jeopardy! which aired in 1978 and 1979),[89] \\"A Time for Tony\\" (whose basic melody evolved into \\"Think!\\", the longtime theme song for Jeopardy![90]), \\"Buzzword\\" (later used as the theme for Merv Griffin's Crosswords), \\"Nightwalk\\", \\"Struttin' on Sunset\\", and an untitled vacation cue.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyone at least 18 years old has the potential to become a contestant through Wheel of Fortune's audition process. Exceptions include employees and immediate family members of CBS Corporation, Sony Pictures Entertainment, or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries; any firm involved in supplying prizes for the show; and television stations that broadcast Wheel and/or Jeopardy!, their sister radio stations, and those advertising agencies that are affiliated with them. Also ineligible to apply as contestants are individuals who have appeared on a different game show within the previous year, three other game shows within the past ten years, or on any version of Wheel of Fortune itself.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the year, the show uses a custom-designed Winnebago recreational vehicle called the \\"Wheelmobile\\" to travel across the United States, holding open auditions at various public venues. Participants are provided with entry forms which are then drawn randomly. Individuals whose names are drawn appear on stage, five at a time, and are interviewed by traveling host Marty Lublin. The group of five then plays a mock version of the speed-up round, and five more names are selected after a puzzle is solved. Everyone who is called onstage receives a themed prize, usually determined by the spin of a miniature wheel. Auditions typically last two days, with three one-hour segments per day.[92] After each Wheelmobile event, the \\"most promising candidates\\" are invited back to the city in which the first audition was held, to participate in a second audition. Alternatively, a participant may submit an audition form with a self-shot video through the show's website to enter an audition. Contestants not appearing on stage at Wheelmobile events have their applications retained and get drawn at random to fill second-level audition vacancies. At the second audition, potential contestants play more mock games featuring a miniature wheel and puzzle board, followed by a 16-puzzle test with some letters revealed. The contestants have five minutes to solve as many puzzles as they can by writing in the correct letters. The people who pass continue the audition, playing more mock games which are followed by interviews.[93][94]\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel of Fortune premiered on January 6, 1975, at 10:30?am (9:30 Central) on NBC. Lin Bolen, then the head of daytime programming, purchased the show from Griffin to compensate him for canceling the original Jeopardy! series, which had one year remaining on its contract. Jeopardy! aired its final episode on the Friday before Wheel's premiere. The original Wheel aired on NBC, in varying time slots between 10:30 am and noon, until June 30, 1989. Throughout that version's run, episodes were generally 30 minutes in length, except for six weeks of shows aired between December 1975 and January 1976 which were 60 minutes in length. NBC announced the cancellation of the show in August 1980, but it stayed on the air following a decision to cut the duration of The David Letterman Show from 90 to 60 minutes.[58] The network Wheel moved to CBS on July 17, 1989, and remained there until January 14, 1991.[9] After that, it briefly returned to NBC, replacing Let's Make a Deal,[95] but was canceled permanently on September 20 of that year.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe daily syndicated version of Wheel premiered on September 19, 1983, preceded by a series of episodes taped on location at the Ohio State Fair and aired on WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio.[96] From its debut, the syndicated version offered a larger prize budget than its network counterpart.[41] The show came from humble beginnings: King World chairmen Roger, Michael, and Robert King could initially find only 50 stations that were willing to carry the show, and since they could not find affiliates for the syndicated Wheel in New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago, Philadelphia was the largest market in which the show could succeed in its early days. Only nine stations carried the show from its beginning,[97] but by midseason it was airing on all 50 of the stations that were initially willing to carry it, and by the beginning of 1984 the show was available to 99 percent of television households. Soon, Wheel succeeded Family Feud as the highest-rated syndicated show,[9] and at the beginning of the 1984ÿ85 season, Griffin followed up on the show's success by launching a syndicated revival of Jeopardy!, hosted by Alex Trebek.[98] The syndicated success of Wheel and Jeopardy! siphoned ratings from the period's three longest-running and most popular game shows, Tic-Tac-Dough, The Joker's Wild, and Family Feud, to the point that all three series came to an end by the fall of 1986. At this point, Wheel had the highest ratings of any syndicated television series in history,[41] and at the peak of the show's popularity, over 40 million people were watching five nights per week. The series, along with companion series Jeopardy!, remained the most-watched syndicated program in the United States until dethroned by Judge Judy in 2011.[99] The program has become America's longest-running syndicated game show and its second-longest in either network or syndication, second to the version of The Price Is Right which began airing in 1972. The syndicated Wheel has become part of the consciousness of over 90 million Americans, and awarded a total of over $200 million in cash and prizes to contestants.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe popularity of Wheel of Fortune has led it to become a worldwide franchise, with over forty known adaptations in international markets outside the United States.[10] Versions of the show have existed in such countries as Australia,[100] Denmark,[101] France,[102] Germany,[103] Italy,[104] Malaysia,[105] New Zealand,[106] the Philippines,[107] Poland,[108] Russia,[109] Spain,[110], United Kingdom and Vietnam (Chiec Non Ky Dieu).[111] The American version of Wheel has honored its international variants with an occasional theme of special weeks known as \\"Wheel Around the World\\", the inaugural episode of which aired when the 23rd syndicated season premiered on September 12, 2005.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween September 1997 and January 1998, CBS and Game Show Network concurrently aired a special children's version of the show titled Wheel 2000. It was hosted by David Sidoni, with Tanika Ray providing voice and motion capture for a virtual reality hostess named \\"Cyber Lucy\\".[113] Created by Scott Sternberg,[113] the spin-off featured special gameplay in which numerous rules were changed. For example, the show's child contestants competed for points and prizes instead of cash, with the eventual winner playing for a grand prize in the bonus round.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel of Fortune has long been one of the highest-rated programs on U.S. syndicated television. It was the highest-rated show in all of syndication before it was dethroned by Two and a Half Men in the 28th season (2010ÿ11).[115][116] The syndicated Wheel shared the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show with Jeopardy! in 2011, and Sajak won three Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Game Show Hostin 1993, 1997, and 1998. In a 2001 issue, TV Guide ranked Wheel number 25 among the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time,[117] and in 2013, the magazine ranked it number 2 in its list of the 60 greatest game shows ever, second only to Jeopardy![5] In August 2006, the show was ranked number 6 on GSN's list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel was the subject of many nominations in GSN's Game Show Awards special, which aired on June 6, 2009.[119] The show was nominated for Best Game Show, but lost to Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?; Sajak and White were nominated for Best Game Show Host, but lost to Deal or No Deal's Howie Mandel; and O'Donnell was considered for Best Announcer but lost to Rich Fields from The Price Is Right. One of the catchphrases uttered by contestants, \\"I'd like to buy a vowel\\", was considered for Favorite Game Show Catch Phrase, but lost to \\"Come on down!\\", the announcer's catchphrase welcoming new contestants to Price. The sound effect heard at the start of a new regular gameplay round won the award for Favorite Game Show Sound Effect. The sound heard when the wheel lands on Bankrupt was also nominated. Despite having been retired from the show for nearly a decade by that point, \\"Changing Keys\\" was nominated for Best Game Show Theme Song. However, it lost to its fellow Griffin composition, \\"Think!\\" from Jeopardy![120]\\r\\n\\r\\nA hall of fame honoring Wheel of Fortune is part of the Sony Pictures Studios tour, and was introduced on the episode aired May 10, 2010.[121] Located in the same stage as the show's taping facility, this hall of fame features memorabilia related to Wheel's syndicated history, including retired props, classic merchandise, photographs, videos, and a special case dedicated to White's wardrobe.[122] Two years later, in 2012, the show was honored with a Ride of Fame on a double decker tour bus in New York City.[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous board games based on Wheel of Fortune have been released by different toy companies. The games are all similar, incorporating a wheel, puzzle display board, play money and various accessories like Free Spin tokens. Milton Bradley released the first board game in 1975. In addition to all the supplies mentioned above, the game included 20 prize cards to simulate the \\"shopping\\" prizes of the show, with prizes ranging in value from $100 to $3,000. Two editions were released, with the only differences being the box art and the included books of puzzles. Other home versions were released by Pressman Toy Corporation, Tyco/Mattel, Parker Brothers, Endless Games, and Irwin Toys.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, several video games based on the show have been released for personal computers, the Internet, and various gaming consoles spanning multiple hardware generations. Most games released in the 20th century were published by GameTek, which produced a dozen Wheel games on various platforms, starting with a Nintendo Entertainment System game released in 1987 and continuing until the company closed in 1998 after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[125] Subsequent games were published by Hasbro Interactive and its acquirer Infogrames/Atari; Sony Online Entertainment, THQ and Ubisoft.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel has also been licensed to International Game Technology for use in its slot machines. The games are all loosely based on the show, with contestants given the chance to spin the wheel to win a jackpot prize. Since 1996, over 200 slot games based on the show have been created, both for real-world casinos and those on the Internet. With over 1,000 wins awarded in excess of $1,000,000 and over $3 billion in jackpots delivered, Wheel has been regarded as the most successful slots brand of all time.[127]","input":"When was the first wheel of fortune aired?"},{"output":"epsilon","context":"The Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the late 9th century BC or early 8th century BC.[3][4] It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet,[5] and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants. It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts.[6] Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields.\\r\\nIn its classical and modern forms, the alphabet has 24 letters, ordered from alpha to omega. Like Latin and Cyrillic, Greek originally had only a single form of each letter; it developed the letter case distinction between upper-case and lower-case forms in parallel with Latin during the modern era.\\r\\nSound values and conventional transcriptions for some of the letters differ between Ancient Greek and Modern Greek usage, because the pronunciation of Greek has changed significantly between the 5th century BC and today. Modern and Ancient Greek use different diacritics. The traditional orthography, which is used for Ancient Greek and sometimes for Modern Greek, has many diacritics, such as accent marks for pitch accent (\\"polytonic\\"), the breathing marks for the presence and absence of the initial /h/ sound, and the iota subscript for the final historical /i/ sound. In standard Modern Greek spelling, orthography has been simplified to a monotonic system, which uses only two diacritics: the acute accent and diaeresis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn both Ancient and Modern Greek, the letters of the Greek alphabet have fairly stable and consistent symbol-to-sound mappings, making pronunciation of words largely predictable. Ancient Greek spelling was generally near-phonemic. For a number of letters, sound values differ considerably between Ancient and Modern Greek, because their pronunciation has followed a set of systematic phonological shifts that affected the language in its post-classical stages.[11]\\r\\nAmong consonant letters, all letters that denoted voiced plosive consonants (/b, d, g/) and aspirated plosives (/p?, t?, k?/) in Ancient Greek stand for corresponding fricative sounds in Modern Greek. The correspondences are as follows:\\r\\nAmong the vowel symbols, Modern Greek sound values reflect the radical simplification of the vowel system of post-classical Greek, merging multiple formerly distinct vowel phonemes into a much smaller number. This leads to several groups of vowel letters denoting identical sounds today. Modern Greek orthography remains true to the historical spellings in most of these cases. As a consequence, the spellings of words in Modern Greek are often not predictable from the pronunciation alone, while the reverse mapping, from spelling to pronunciation, is usually regular and predictable.\\r\\nThe following vowel letters and digraphs are involved in the mergers:\\r\\nModern Greek speakers typically use the same, modern symbolÿsound mappings in reading Greek of all historical stages. In other countries, students of Ancient Greek may use a variety of conventional approximations of the historical sound system in pronouncing Ancient Greek.\\r\\nSeveral letter combinations have special conventional sound values different from those of their single components. Among them are several digraphs of vowel letters that formerly represented diphthongs but are now monophthongized. In addition to the four mentioned above (?, ϫ, , ?), there is also ??, pronounced /u/. The Ancient Greek diphthongs ?ϫ?, ?? and ?? are pronounced [av], [ev] and [iv] in Modern Greek. In some environments they are devoiced to [af], [ef] and [if] respectively.[12] The Modern Greek consonant combinations ?? and ?? stand for [b] and [d] (or [mb] and [nd]) respectively; ?? stands for [dz] and ?? stands for [t?s]. In addition, both in Ancient and Modern Greek, the letter ??, before another velar consonant, stands for the velar nasal [?]; thus ?? and ?۰? are pronounced like English ?ng?. In analogy to ?? and ??, ?۰? is also used to stand for [g]. There are also the combinations ?? and ??.\\r\\nIn the polytonic orthography traditionally used for ancient Greek, the stressed vowel of each word carries one of three accent marks: either the acute accent (?), the grave accent (?), or the circumflex accent (ϫ? or ϫ?). These signs were originally designed to mark different forms of the phonological pitch accent in Ancient Greek. By the time their use became conventional and obligatory in Greek writing, in late antiquity, pitch accent was evolving into a single stress accent, and thus the three signs have not corresponded to a phonological distinction in actual speech ever since. In addition to the accent marks, every word-initial vowel must carry either of two so-called \\"breathing marks\\": the rough breathing (?), marking an /h/ sound at the beginning of a word, or the smooth breathing (?), marking its absence. The letter rho (), although not a vowel, also carries a rough breathing in word-initial position. If a rho was geminated within a word, the first  always had the smooth breathing and the second the rough breathing (??) leading to the transiliteration rrh.\\r\\nThe vowel letters ?ϫ, , ? carry an additional diacritic in certain words, the so-called iota subscript, which has the shape of a small vertical stroke or a miniature ?? below the letter. This iota represents the former offglide of what were originally long diphthongs, ??, , ? (i.e. /a?i, ??i, ??i/), which became monophthongized during antiquity.\\r\\nAnother diacritic used in Greek is the diaeresis (), indicating a hiatus.\\r\\nIn 1982, a new, simplified orthography, known as \\"monotonic\\", was adopted for official use in Modern Greek by the Greek state. It uses only a single accent mark, the acute (also known in this context as tonos, i.e. simply \\"accent\\"), marking the stressed syllable of polysyllabic words, and occasionally the diaeresis to distinguish diphthongal from digraph readings in pairs of vowel letters, making this monotonic system very similar to the accent mark system used in Spanish. The polytonic system is still conventionally used for writing Ancient Greek, while in some book printing and generally in the usage of conservative writers it can still also be found in use for Modern Greek.\\r\\nAlthough it is not a diacritic, the comma has a similar function as a silent letter in a handful of Greek words, principally distinguishing ?, (܇,ti, \\"whatever\\") from ? (܇ti, \\"that\\").[13]\\r\\nThere are many different methods of rendering Greek text or Greek names in the Latin script. The form in which classical Greek names are conventionally rendered in English goes back to the way Greek loanwords were incorporated into Latin in antiquity. In this system, ?? is replaced with ?c?, the diphthongs ?ϫ? and ?? are rendered as ?ae? and ?oe? (or ??,??) respectively; and ?? and ?? are simplified to ?i? and ?u? respectively. In modern scholarly transliteration of Ancient Greek, ?? will usually be rendered as ?k?, and the vowel combinations ?ϫ, , , ? as ?ai, oi, ei, ou? respectively. The letters ?Ĳ? and ?? are generally rendered as ?th? and ?ph?; ?? as either ?ch? or ?kh?; and word-initial ?? as ?rh?.\\r\\nFor Modern Greek, there are multiple different transcription conventions. They differ widely, depending on their purpose, on how close they stay to the conventional letter correspondences of Ancient Greek-based transcription systems, and to what degree they attempt either an exact letter-by-letter transliteration or rather a phonetically based transcription. Standardized formal transcription systems have been defined by the International Organization for Standardization (as ISO 843),[14] by the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names,[15] by the Library of Congress,[16] and others.\\r\\nDuring the Mycenaean period, from around the 16th century to the 12th century BC, Linear B was used to write the earliest attested form of the Greek language, known as Mycenaean Greek. This writing system, unrelated to the Greek alphabet, last appeared in the 13th century BC. In the late 9th century BC or early 8th century BC, the Greek alphabet emerged.[2] The period between the use of the two writing systems, during which no Greek texts are attested, is known as the Greek Dark Ages. The Greeks adopted the alphabet from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, one of the closely related scripts used for the West Semitic languages. However, the Phoenician alphabet is limited to consonants. When it was adopted for writing Greek, certain consonants were adapted to express vowels. The use of both vowels and consonants makes Greek the first alphabet in the narrow sense,[6] as distinguished from the abjads used in Semitic languages, which have letters only for consonants.[17]\\r\\nGreek initially took over all of the 22 letters of Phoenician. Five were reassigned to denote vowel sounds: the glide consonants /j/ (yodh) and /w/ (waw) were used for [i] (, iota) and [u] (, upsilon) respectively; the glottal stop consonant /?/ (|aleph) was used for [a] (ʽ, alpha); the pharyngeal /?/ (?ayin) was turned into [o] (Ѯ, omicron); and the letter for /h/ (he) was turned into [e] (, epsilon). A doublet of waw was also borrowed as a consonant for [w] (?, digamma). In addition, the Phoenician letter for the emphatic glottal /?/ (heth) was borrowed in two different functions by different dialects of Greek: as a letter for /h/ (, heta) by those dialects that had such a sound, and as an additional vowel letter for the long /??/ (, eta) by those dialects that lacked the consonant. Eventually, a seventh vowel letter for the long /??/ (, omega) was introduced.\\r\\nGreek also introduced three new consonant letters for its aspirated plosive sounds and consonant clusters:  (phi) for /p?/,  (chi) for /k?/ and  (psi) for /ps/. In western Greek variants,  was instead used for /ks/ and  for /k?/. The origin of these letters is a matter of some debate.\\r\\nThree of the original Phoenician letters dropped out of use before the alphabet took its classical shape: the letter ? (san), which had been in competition with ҷ (sigma) denoting the same phoneme /s/; the letter ? (qoppa), which was redundant with  (kappa) for /k/, and ? (digamma), whose sound value /w/ dropped out of the spoken language before or during the classical period.\\r\\nGreek was originally written predominantly from right to left, just like Phoenician, but scribes could freely alternate between directions. For a time, a writing style with alternating right-to-left and left-to-right lines (called boustrophedon, literally \\"ox-turning\\", after the manner of an ox ploughing a field) was common, until in the classical period the left-to-right writing direction became the norm. Individual letter shapes were mirrored depending on the writing direction of the current line.\\r\\nThere were initially numerous local variants of the Greek alphabet, which differed in the use and non-use of the additional vowel and consonant symbols and several other features. A form of western Greek native to Euboea, which among other things had  for /ks/, was transplanted to Italy by early Greek colonists, and became the ancestor of the Old Italic alphabets and ultimately, through Etruscan, of the Latin alphabet. Athens used a local form of the alphabet until the 5th century BC; it lacked the letters ּ and  as well as the vowel symbols  and . The classical 24-letter alphabet that became the norm later was originally the local alphabet of Ionia; this was adopted by Athens in 403 BC under archon Eucleides and in most other parts of the Greek-speaking world during the 4th century BC.\\r\\nWhen the Greeks adapted the Phoenician alphabet, they took over not only the letter shapes and sound values, but also the names by which the sequence of the alphabet could be recited and memorized. In Phoenician, each letter name was a word that began with the sound represented by that letter; thus ?aleph, the word for \\"ox\\", was used as the name for the glottal stop /?/, bet, or \\"house\\", for the /b/ sound, and so on. When the letters were adopted by the Greeks, most of the Phoenician names were maintained or modified slightly to fit Greek phonology; thus, ?aleph, bet, gimel became alpha, beta, gamma.\\r\\nThe Greek names of the following letters are more or less straightforward continuations of their Phoenician antecedents. Between Ancient and Modern Greek they have remained largely unchanged, except that their pronunciation has followed regular sound changes along with other words (for instance, in the name of beta, ancient /b/ regularly changed to modern /v/, and ancient /??/ to modern /i/, resulting in the modern pronunciation vita). The name of lambda is attested in early sources as ?Ѵϫ besides ?Ѵϫ;[18] in Modern Greek the spelling is often ?Ѵϫ, reflecting pronunciation. Similarly, iota is sometimes spelled ?ϫ in Modern Greek ([?] is conventionally transcribed ?{,,,,}? word-initially and intervocalically before back vowels and /a/). In the tables below, the Greek names of all letters are given in their traditional polytonic spelling; in modern practice, like with all other words, they are usually spelled in the simplified monotonic system.\\r\\nIn the cases of the three historical sibilant letters below, the correspondence between Phoenician and Ancient Greek is less clear, with apparent mismatches both in letter names and sound values. The early history of these letters (and the fourth sibilant letter, obsolete san) has been a matter of some debate. Here too, the changes in the pronunciation of the letter names between Ancient and Modern Greek are regular.\\r\\nIn the following group of consonant letters, the older forms of the names in Ancient Greek were spelled with -?, indicating an original pronunciation with -. In Modern Greek these names are spelled with -.\\r\\nThe following group of vowel letters were originally called simply by their sound values as long vowels: , , , and ?. Their modern names contain adjectival qualifiers that were added during the Byzantine period, to distinguish between letters that had become confusable. Thus, the letters ?? and ??, pronounced identically by this time, were called o mikron (\\"small o\\") and o mega (\\"big o\\") respectively. The letter ?? was called e psilon (\\"plain e\\") to distinguish it from the identically pronounced digraph ?ϫ?, while, similarly, ??, which at this time was pronounced [y], was called y psilon (\\"plain y\\") to distinguish it from the identically pronounced digraph ??.\\r\\nSome dialects of the Aegean and Cypriot have retained long consonants and pronounce [??am?a] and [?kap?a]; also, ?ϫ has come to be pronounced [?it?a] in Cypriot.[19]\\r\\nLike Latin and other alphabetic scripts, Greek originally had only a single form of each letter, without a distinction between uppercase and lowercase. This distinction is an innovation of the modern era, drawing on different lines of development of the letter shapes in earlier handwriting.\\r\\nThe oldest forms of the letters in antiquity are majuscule forms. Besides the upright, straight inscriptional forms (capitals) found in stone carvings or incised pottery, more fluent writing styles adapted for handwriting on soft materials were also developed during antiquity. Such handwriting has been preserved especially from papyrus manuscripts in Egypt since the Hellenistic period. Ancient handwriting developed two distinct styles: uncial writing, with carefully drawn, rounded block letters of about equal size, used as a book hand for carefully produced literary and religious manuscripts, and cursive writing, used for everyday purposes.[20] The cursive forms approached the style of lowercase letter forms, with ascenders and descenders, as well as many connecting lines and ligatures between letters.\\r\\nIn the 9th and 10th century, uncial book hands were replaced with a new, more compact writing style, with letter forms partly adapted from the earlier cursive.[20] This minuscule style remained the dominant form of handwritten Greek into the modern era. During the Renaissance, western printers adopted the minuscule letter forms as lowercase printed typefaces, while modelling uppercase letters on the ancient inscriptional forms. The orthographic practice of using the letter case distinction for marking proper names, titles etc. developed in parallel to the practice in Latin and other western languages.\\r\\nThe Greek alphabet was the model for various others:[6]\\r\\nIt is also considered a possible ancestor of the Armenian alphabet, which in turn influenced the development of the Georgian alphabet.[22]\\r\\nApart from the daughter alphabets listed above, which were adapted from Greek but developed into separate writing systems, the Greek alphabet has also been adopted at various times and in various places to write other languages.[23] For some of them, additional letters were introduced.\\r\\nGreek symbols are used as symbols in mathematics, physics and other sciences. Many symbols have traditional uses, such as lower case epsilon () for an arbitrarily small positive number, lower case pi () for the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, capital sigma (ҷ) for summation, and lower case sigma () for standard deviation.\\r\\nGreek letters are used to denote the brighter stars within each of the eighty-eight constellations. In most constellations the brightest star is designated Alpha and the next brightest Beta etc. For example, the brightest star in the constellation of Centaurus is known as Alpha Centauri. For historical reasons, the Greek designations of some constellations begin with a lower ranked letter.\\r\\nSeveral Greek letters are used as phonetic symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).[31] Several of them denote fricative consonants; the rest stand for variants of vowel sounds. The glyph shapes used for these letters in specialized phonetic fonts is sometimes slightly different from the conventional shapes in Greek typography proper, with glyphs typically being more upright and using serifs, to make them conform more with the typographical character of other, Latin-based letters in the phonetic alphabet. Nevertheless, in the Unicode encoding standard, the following three phonetic symbols are considered the same characters as the corresponding Greek letters proper:[32]\\r\\nOn the other hand, the following phonetic letters have Unicode representations separate from their Greek alphabetic use, either because their conventional typographic shape is too different from the original, or because they also have secondary uses as regular alphabetic characters in some Latin-based alphabets, including separate Latin uppercase letters distinct from the Greek ones.\\r\\nThe symbol in Americanist phonetic notation for the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative is the Greek letter lambda ??, but ??? in the IPA. The IPA symbol for the palatal lateral approximant is ???, which looks similar to lambda, but is actually an inverted lowercase y.\\r\\nGreek letters were also used to write numbers. In the classical Ionian system, the first nine letters of the alphabet stood for the numbers from 1 to 9, the next nine letters stood for the multiples of 10, from 10 to 90, and the next nine letters stood for the multiples of 100, from 100 to 900. For this purpose, in addition to the 24 letters which by that time made up the standard alphabet, three otherwise obsolete letters were retained or revived: digamma ??? for 6, koppa ??? for 90, and a rare Ionian letter for [ss], today called sampi ???, for 900. This system has remained in use in Greek up to the present day, although today it is only employed for limited purposes such as enumerating chapters in a book, similar to the way Roman numerals are used in English. The three extra symbols are today written as ???, ??? and ??? respectively. To mark a letter as a numeral sign, a small stroke called keraia is added to the right of it.\\r\\nIn North America, many college fraternities and sororities are named with combinations of Greek letters, and are hence also known as \\"Greek letter organizations\\". This naming tradition was initiated by the foundation of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, in 1776.[33]\\r\\nSome letters can occur in variant shapes, mostly inherited from medieval minuscule handwriting. While their use in normal typography of Greek is purely a matter of font styles, some such variants have been given separate encodings in Unicode.\\r\\nFor the usage in computers, a variety of encodings have been used for Greek online, many of them documented in RFC 1947.\\r\\nThe two principal ones still used today are ISO/IEC 8859-7 and Unicode. ISO 8859-7 supports only the monotonic orthography; Unicode supports both the monotonic and polytonic orthographies.\\r\\nFor the range A0ÿFF (hex) it follows the Unicode range 370ÿ3CF (see below) except that some symbols, like ?, ?,  etc. are used where Unicode has unused locations. Like all ISO-8859 encodings it is equal to ASCII for 00ÿ7F (hex).\\r\\nUnicode supports polytonic orthography well enough for ordinary continuous text in modern and ancient Greek, and even many archaic forms for epigraphy. With the use of combining characters, Unicode also supports Greek philology and dialectology and various other specialized requirements. Most current text rendering engines do not render diacritics well, so, though alpha with macron and acute can be represented as U+03B1 U+0304 U+0301, this rarely renders well: ??.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere are two main blocks of Greek characters in Unicode. The first is \\"Greek and Coptic\\" (U+0370 to U+03FF). This block is based on ISO 8859-7 and is sufficient to write Modern Greek. There are also some archaic letters and Greek-based technical symbols.\\r\\nThis block also supports the Coptic alphabet. Formerly most Coptic letters shared codepoints with similar-looking Greek letters; but in many scholarly works, both scripts occur, with quite different letter shapes, so as of Unicode 4.1, Coptic and Greek were disunified. Those Coptic letters with no Greek equivalents still remain in this block (U+03E2 to U+03EF).\\r\\nTo write polytonic Greek, one may use combining diacritical marks or the precomposed characters in the \\"Greek Extended\\" block (U+1F00 to U+1FFF).\\r\\nCombining and spacing (letter-free) diacritical marks pertaining to Greek language:\\r\\nIBM code pages 437, 860, 861, 862, 863, and 865 contain the letters æҷӴϫѴ𿼶 (plus  as an alternate interpretation for ?).\\r\\nNot to be confused with the Greek-letter acronyms for the names of entire fraternities (or sororities), different chapters within the same fraternity are almost always (with a handful of exceptions) named using Greek letters as serial numbers. The founding chapter of each respective organization is its A Chapter. As an organization expands, it establishes a B Chapter, a æ Chapter, and so on and so forth.\\r\\nIn an organization that expands to more than 24 chapters, the chapter after  Chapter is AA Chapter, followed by AB Chapter, etc. Each of these is still a \\"Chapter Letter,\\" albeit a double-digit letter just as 10 through 99 are double-digit numbers. The Roman alphabet has a similar extended form with such double-digit letters when necessary, but it is used for columns in a table or chart rather than chapters of an organization.","input":"What is the fifth letter of the greek alphabet?"},{"output":"attach a hook only to a leader, rather than directly to the main line","context":"The snell knot is a hitch knot used to attach an eyed fishing hook to fishing line.

The show focuses on the adventures of a little girl named Masha and a fatherly bear that always keeps her from disasters. The first episode was released in 2009.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series has been translated into 25 languages and was broadcast in more than 100 countries.[citation needed] The series was released on Netflix and through NBCUniversal.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the episodes have been successful on YouTube.

The show was presented for the first time on October 3, 2015, in Ko?ice, Slovakia, and has also been performed in the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, the United Arab Emirates and Estonia.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nMasha is a Russian girl who lives in the forest with her pig, goat and dog. All the animals in the forest are afraid of her as she is constantly forcing them to play with her. One morning, Masha sees a butterfly and inadvertently follows it inside the home of a bear who has gone fishing. While playing there, she makes a big mess. When the Bear returns, he sees the disaster caused by Masha. The Bear tries to get rid of Masha, but he is unsuccessful, and he and Masha become friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn each episode of the show, Masha is portrayed as a smart, kind, but mischievous little girl who is exploring the world around her. This leads to many funny and entertaining situations.  The kind-hearted Bear is always trying to keep Masha out of trouble, but often ends up the unintended victim of her mischief. There are several supporting characters in the series, including Masha's cousin Dasha, a penguin adopted by the Bear, a young panda cub from China, who is the Bear's cousin, two wolves who live in an old UAZ ambulance car, a tiger that used to work with the Bear in the circus, and a Female Bear that is the object of the bear's affections.  Characters also include a hare, squirrels and hedgehogs, a pig called Rosie, a goat, and a dog who all live in Masha's front yard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the project's director, Denis Chervyatsov,\\r\\n\\r\\nMasha was based on a real person... In the 1990s, the project's artistic director, Oleg Kuzovkov, was on holiday when he saw a little girl on the beach. The child was so genuine and open that she could easily walk up to a stranger and play chess with him or pick up his flippers and go swimming. However, after a few days, the vacationers began to hide...[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series' production has been handled domestically at Animaccord Animation studio since 2008.[5] The scenario for each episode is written by Oleg Kuzovkov, creator of the cartoon. Then the storyboarding is developed in accordance with the script and, in general, consists of at least 2000 slides. After the team finalizes the plot of an episode, the work for the 2D animatic kicks off. At this stage, animators define the duration of each scene in an episode, how characters are placed in it and interact with each other. After this step of the production is finished, the episode is passed for dubbing. Dubbing must be completed before 3D animation is applied, as the 3D animators need to know the characters' dialogue, intonations, and emotions in advance in order to keep their lip movements synchronized to the audio and make their facial expressions look realistic.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 3D animation process begins right after dubbing has been finished. Animators manipulate all the movements that happen during the scenes, such as opening doors, taking books from bookshelves, and creating all the bodily movements required to bring the characters to life.\\r\\n\\r\\nRendering brings all the processes together. Renderers colorize grey 3D models and add such details as the Bears fur, Mashas hair, etc. They create the lighting and weather in the scene as determined by the script.\\r\\n\\r\\nComposing is the final stage of production, where the composers review all scenes of an episode, checking the color intensities, smoothing the edges of 3D models, and bringing all the components together to form a complete episode. Then the work is approved by the director and script-writer and uploaded to the show's official YouTube channel (MashaBearTV).\\r\\n\\r\\nMasha, her cousin and Father Frost are the only characters who speak. The others communicate through pantomime or wordless sounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first two seasons, Mashas voice in the original Russian version was performed by Alina Kukushkina, who was 6 years old when she began to dub Masha. For the third season (seven years later in 2015), the officials of Animaccord studio confirmed that the new voice of Masha would be 6-year-old Varvara Sarantseva. The show's sound designer, Boris Kutnevich, provides the voice of The Bear. Mark Kutnevich provides the voice of The Hare.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the English version, Elsie Fisher  the voice of Agnes in the Despicable Me films ÿ dubbed the voice of Masha in the first season.[2] In subsequent seasons Masha was dubbed by Rebecca Bloom (ep. 27ÿ39) and Angelica Keamy (ep. 40ÿ52) and now is Giulia De Carvalho and Kaitlyn McCormick.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music for each episode is written by Russian composer Vasiliy Bogatirev. Most of the songs used in the cartoon, such as the soundtracks of Laundry Day and The Grand Piano Lesson episodes, became very popular in Russia and abroad.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Associated Press, \\"Masha, who is dressed in a folk costume with a headscarf, became a household name in many Muslim nations including Indonesia.\\"[8] Dmitry Loveyko, managing director of Animaccord, said that \\"It's a Muslim country, so we thought we're lucky she wears a headscarf and her legs are covered!\\"[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Masha and the Bear mobile app was released by Apps Ministry in August 2011. In 2013 the first mobile game \\"Masha and the Bear: Search and Rescue\\" was published by Apps Ministry. Later more publishers such as Indigo Kids, PSV Studio, Noviy Disk developed and released games and apps featuring Masha and the Bear.\\r\\n\\r\\nNetflix has released 27 of the first 29 episodes in 9 episodes of 3 segments each. Many of the videos were uploaded multiple times on three different YouTube channels (\\"  ־^\\", \\"Get Movies\\" and \\"Masha and The Bear\\") so their view counts across up to three channels have been combined.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDebuts dates listed are for English releases in Canada on Treehouse TV, original air dates in Russia unknown:\\r\\n\\r\\nSeries description is \\"Masha retells fairy tales in her own way.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDebut dates listed per Treehouse TV:\\r\\n\\r\\nMasha (Diminutive form of the name Maria/Mary) is a six-year-old girl. Masha is naughty and hyperactive, and always thinks about playing. She lives in a house near a railway station; near her house there is a path that leads to Bear's house. Masha loves Bear very much, but in her games she tends to create problems for Bear. Her parents do not appear in the series. She loves sweets, jumping in a bucket, and looking at drawings of Masha and Bear. Masha's character combines the characteristics of 6-year-olds (making grammatical errors when speaking, crying when she is not given what she wants) with adult skills (playing tennis, fishing, making preserves, playing electric guitar). She is voiced by Alina Kukushkina. In English, Masha was voiced by Giselle Nieto, Elsie Fisher and Rebecca Bloom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bear is a retired circus bear who lives in a tree house in the forest. His past occupation makes him very talented in performing arts (like juggling, unicycling, and even stage magic) although he's also known to dabble into other hobbies and even some intellectual pursuits. Some episodes feature flashbacks in which he remembers his childhood as a cub in the same house. In some episodes of the Russian-language version, Masha calls him \\"Mishka\\" (Russian: Ұ翹, English: Literally Little Bear), which is a traditional name given to bears in Russian tales. He is a huge bear with a big heart and he is Masha's best friend, as well as a parental figure to her. He was voiced by Boris Kutnevich.\\r\\n\\r\\nA dog, a goat, a pig, and, in the first episode, chickens. They live outside Masha's house in her front yard but almost every time Masha comes out they hide themselves to avoid her. The Pig is often forced to play with Masha, who makes it dress up like a baby in a stroller. In the episode \\"Dance Fever\\" it is revealed that the pig's name is Rosie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wild animals are a rabbit, squirrels, hedgehogs, and two wolves. Masha and a certain Hare (in the episode 'One, two three! Light the Christmas Tree' the present list of Father Frost in English describes this creature as 'Bunny') often play hockey together (and make a mess or accidentally hurt someone), and the Hare is occasionally an antagonist of the Bear, due to stealing carrots from the Bear's garden. The two Wolves live in a derelict ambulance car on top of a hill and often look for something to eat, and strangely act as medics for any apparent injuries or illnesses though they sometimes fear Masha (due to the Russian idiomatic expression \\"wolves are orderlies of the woods\\" (\\"񶶿 ÿ  \\"), living in an ambulance cab and acting as medics is a pun).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe She-Bear is a female bear. The Bear is enamored of her and sometimes goes out of his way to impress or even woo her. The first time she rebuffed him in favor of the Black Bear, only to realize how self-absorbed he is, and another time she turned her nose up at the Bear's classical guitar playing as she preferred more modern music. Even so, the She-Bear usually opens up to the Bear, such as the time she agreed to have a dinner with him, and she is sometimes kind to Masha, such as giving her a fashion magazine, helping to train her for her tennis match against the Black Bear, and helping her learn to ice-skate.\\r\\n\\r\\nDasha is Masha's cousin from Moscow. She looks like Masha but she is very different, she has beige hair, blue eyes,  wears blue glasses and an orange dress. She is afraid of the Bear and calls him \\"Shaggy\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nPanda is a panda cub and the Bear's young cousin from China. He and Masha are rivals, often bickering every time he comes for a visit, but they occasionally get along and have fun together.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tiger who is Bear's best friend from their days performing together in the circus.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Himalayan Black Bear, who is Bear's worst enemy and Bear's chief rival for the attentions of the She-Bear. The Black Bear has an arrogant and unsportsmanlike personality, cheating to win against Masha in a tennis game, and laughing at her when she grows gigantic. Bear's biggest fear is if Black bear and she bear marry which is shown in Game Over when bear imagines what will happen if he Plays games his whole life\\r\\n\\r\\nA penguin that first appears in \\"The Foundling\\", as an egg that Masha finds and makes the Bear hatch. The Penguin quickly imprints on the Bear as his parental-figure and the Bear forms a sincere bond with him but chooses to send the Penguin to live in Antarctica for his own health. Even so, they stay in touch and the Penguin once visited.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is a Santa Claus-like character from Russia who appears in Christmas-themed shows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese aliens appeared in episode 65. They live far away from Earth in the Universe. When 3 specimen accidentally crashed on Earth they were helped by Bear and Masha to get back to their spaceship.\\r\\n\\r\\nA spin-off series to the show titled Masha's Tales is also available on Netflix. In the show Masha (voiced by a much older actress) tells classic Russian fairy tales as well as some Grimms' Fairy Tales to her toys. However, Masha makes up her own way of telling the stories (Such as putting a magical nutcracker who turns into a prince when she adapts Cinderella). She also mixes up the morals of the stories by often adding an additional ending so that way it could fit with what she's telling her toys. Masha's Tales premiered on Cartoon Network UK's sister pre-school channel, Cartoonito on June 20, 2016.[27] Another spin-off of the Masha and the Bear franchise ÿ Masha's Spooky Stories ÿ premiered on Cartoonito UK and Netflix in October 2016.[28]","input":"What country is masha and the bear from?"},{"output":"Navy Enlisted Classification","context":"The Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) system supplements the rating designators for enlisted members of the United States Navy. A naval rating and NEC designator are similar to the Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) designators used in the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps and the Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) used in the U.S. Air Force.\\r\\nThe U.S. Navy has several ratings or job specialties for its enlisted members. An enlisted member is known by the enlisted rating, for example, a Machinist's Mate (or MM or by the enlisted rate, for example Petty Officer First Class (or PO1). Often Navy enlisted members are addressed by a combination of rating and rate. In this example, this machinist's mate petty officer first class may be addressed as Machinist's Mate 1st Class (or MM1).\\r\\nHowever, the NEC designator is a four-digit code that identifies skills and abilities beyond the standard (or outward) rating designator. According to the Military Personnel Manual (MILSPERMAN) 1221-010, the NEC designator facilitates personnel planning, procurement, and selection for training; development of training requirements; promotion, distribution, assignment and the orderly call to active duty of inactive duty personnel in times of national emergency or mobilization.\\r\\nFor example, a person holding the MM-3385 is a nuclear-trained machinist's mate for surface ships, and a person with an MM-3355 is a nuclear-trained machinist's mate for submarines.\\r\\nIn the U.S. Navy's officer ranks, the naval officer designator serves a similar purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n0160 -

Located in present-day San Diego, California, it was founded on July 16, 1769, by Spanish friar Junpero Serra in an area long inhabited by the Kumeyaay people. The mission and the surrounding area were named for the Catholic Didacus of Alcal, a Spaniard more commonly known as San Diego. The mission was the site of the first Christian burial in Alta California. San Diego is also generally regarded as the site of the region's first public execution, in 1778. Father Luis Jayme, California's first Christian martyr, lies entombed beneath the chancel floor. The current church, built in the early 19th century, is the fifth to stand on this location.[16][17] The mission site is a National Historic Landmark.[14][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former Spanish settlement at the Kumeyaay Nipawai lies within that area occupied during the late Paleoindian period and continuing on into the present day by the Native society commonly known as the Diegue?o;[19] the name denotes those people who were ministered by the padres at Mission San Diego de Alcal.[20] Relatively, much is known about the native inhabitants in recent centuries, thanks in part to the efforts of the Spanish explorer Juan Rodrguez Cabrillo, who documented his observations of life in the coastal villages he encountered along the Southern California coast in October 1542.[21] Cabrillo, a Portuguese navigator in the service of Spain, is credited as the first European to encounter San Diego Bay. On the evening of September 28, 1542, the ships San Salvador and Victoria sailed into the harbor, whereupon Cabrillo christened it \\"San Miguel.\\"[22] During that expedition a landing party went ashore and briefly interacted with a small group of natives. Some sixty years later another Spanish explorer, Sebastin Vizcano, made landfall some ten miles from the present Mission site. Under Vizcano's command the San Diego, Santo Toms, and frigate Tres Reyes dropped anchor on November 10, 1602, and the port was renamed \\"San Diego de Alcal.\\"[23][24]\\r\\nIt would be another 167 years before the Spanish returned to San Diego. Ever since the voyages of Christopher Columbus, the Kingdom of Spain sought to establish missions to convert the pagans in Nueva Espa?a (\\"New Spain\\") to Roman Catholicism to save souls and to facilitate colonization of these lands. However, it was not until 1741the time of the Vitus Bering expedition, when the territorial ambitions of Tsarist Russia towards North America became knownthat King Philip V felt such installations were necessary in Upper California.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1769, Visitador General Jos de Glvez sent the expedition of Junpero Serra and Gaspar de Portol to found missions and presidios at San Diego and Monterey (see Timeline of the Portol expedition), thereby securing Spain's claim to the Pacific Coast harbors recommended by Cabrillo and Vizcaino.[26] Two groups traveled from Lower California on foot, while a pair of packet ships (bearing supplies) traveled up the coast from the Baja California Peninsula.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 9, 1834, Governor Figueroa issued his \\"Decree of Confiscation.\\"[29] The missions were offered for sale to citizens, who were unable to come up with the price, so all mission property was broken up into ranchos and given to ex-military officers who had fought in the War of Independence against Spain. On June 8, 1846, Mission San Diego de Alcal was given to Santiago Argello by Governor Po Pico \\"...for services rendered to the government.\\"[30]  After the United States annexed California, the Mission was used by the military from 1846 to 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Abraham Lincoln signed a proclamation on May 23, 1862, that restored ownership of the Mission proper to the Roman Catholic Church.[31][32] When Mission San Diego de Alcal was granted back to the Church, it was in ruins. In the 1880s Father Anthony Ubach began to restore the old Mission buildings.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Ubach died in 1907 and restoration work ceased until 1931. In 1941, the Mission once again became a parish church, in what is still an active parish serving the Diocese of San Diego. In 1976, Pope Paul VI designated the Mission church as a minor basilica.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nMission San Diego de Alcal is located within San Diego city limits, near the intersection of Interstate 8 and Interstate 15, and approximately one mile east of Qualcomm Stadium. The parish is partially funded by a gift shop, and self-guided tours of the grounds and buildings are available to the public for a small donation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal of the missions was, above all, to become self-sufficient in relatively short order. Farming, therefore, was the most important industry of any mission. Prior to the establishment of the missions, the native peoples knew only how to utilize bone, seashells, stone, and wood for building, tool making, weapons, and so forth. The missionaries discovered that the Indians, who regarded labor as degrading to men, had to be taught industry in order to learn how to be self-supportive. The result was the establishment of a great manual training school that comprised agriculture, the mechanical arts, and the raising and care of livestock. Everything consumed and otherwise utilized by the natives was produced at the missions under the supervision of the padres; thus, the neophytes not only supported themselves, but after 1811 sustained the entire military and civil government of California.[34] Wheat, corn, wine grapes, barley, beans, cattle, horses, and sheep were the major crops at San Diego. In 1795, construction on a system of aqueducts was begun to bring water to the fields and the Mission (the first irrigation project in Upper California).[35] The building manager was Fray Pedro Panto, who was poisoned by his Indian cook Nazario before the project was completed.[36] In his testimony, in the trial that followed, Nazario stated that he had poisoned the friar due to constant beatings inflicted by Friar Panto.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mission San Diego was primarily supported from lands included in a Spanish royal land grant, encompassing roughly the eastern third of the current City of San Diego, as well as most of the cities of La Mesa and Lemon Grove. While not exact, its boundaries are roughly Interstate 805, Miramar Road, Route 125 (California), Skyline Drive and Division Street. Boundary Street (which parallels Interstate 805 in the neighborhood of North Park) lies directly on one portion of the boundary and draws its name from it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first vineyards planted in California were planted at the mission in 1769.[38] Father Junpero Serra planted these initial vines.[39] The vines were of the Mission variety, which were brought to Mexico in the 16th Century.[40] Unfortunately, the initial plantings did not survive, with Mission San Juan Capistrano having the first surviving plantings.[41] By at least 1781, wine was being produced at the mission.[42] One source claims that the vineyard on mission lands reached up to fifty thousand acres.[43] The mission vineyards were around until at least 1823.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nBells were vitally important to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, to call the Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with ringing the mission bells.\\r\\nThis mission had five bells.[citation needed]","input":"Who built the san diego de alcala mission?"},{"output":"San Gabriel Mountains","context":"The San Gabriel Mountains are a mountain range located in northern Los Angeles County and western San Bernardino County, California, United States.[1] The mountain range is part of the Transverse Ranges and lies between the Los Angeles Basin and the Mojave Desert, with Interstate 5 to the west and Interstate 15 to the east.

The range lacks craggy features, but contains a large number of canyons and is generally very rugged and difficult to traverse. The San Gabriel Mountains are in effect a large fault block that was uplifted and then dissected by numerous rivers and washes.\\r\\nThe highest elevation, Mount San Antonio at 10,064 feet (3,068?m), rises towards the eastern extremity of the range which extends from the Cajon Pass (Interstate 15 Freeway) on the east, where the San Gabriel Mountain Range meets the San Bernardino Mountain Range, westward to meet the Santa Susanna range at Newhall Pass (Interstate 5 Freeway).\\r\\nNorth of San Fernando, the San Gabriel Mountains crest abruptly up to almost 4,000 feet (1,200?m). Pacoima and Big Tujunga Canyons cut through the range just east of San Fernando, carrying runoff into the San Fernando Valley. Little Tujunga Canyon Road bridges the range in this area, connecting the San Fernando Valley to the Santa Clara River valley in the north. Towering over Big Tujunga Canyon north of Big Tujunga Reservoir is Mount Gleason, which at 6,502 feet (1,982?m), is the highest in this region of the San Gabriels. South of the gorge are the southern \\"foothills\\" of the mountains, which rise abruptly 4,000 feet (1,200?m) above the Los Angeles Basin and give rise to the Arroyo Seco, a tributary of the Los Angeles River.\\r\\nSoutheast of Big Tujunga Canyon, the southern front range of the San Gabriels gradually grows in elevation, culminating in notable peaks such as Mount Wilson at 5,710 feet (1,740?m). On the north the range is abruptly dissected by the canyon of the West Fork San Gabriel River. Even further north the range slopes up into the towering main crest of the San Gabriels, a sweeping arc-shaped massif 30 miles (48?km) in length that includes most of the highest peaks in the range: Waterman Mountain, at 8,038 feet (2,450?m); Mount Islip, at 8,250 feet (2,510?m), Mount Baden-Powell, at 9,399 feet (2,865?m), Pine Mountain, at 9,648 feet (2,941?m), and finally Mount San Antonio, the highest peak in the range at 10,068 feet (3,069?m).\\r\\nOn the north slopes of the San Gabriel crest, the northern ranks of mountains drop down incrementally to the floor of the Mojave Desert in a much more gradual manner than the sheer southern flank. The Angeles Crest Highway, one of the main routes across the San Gabriels, runs through this area from west to east. Little Rock, Big Rock and Sheep Creeks drain off the northern part of the mountains, forming large alluvial fans as they descend into the Mojave. To the east, the San Andreas Fault cuts across the range, forming a series of long, straight and narrow depressions, including Swarthout Valley and Lone Pine Canyon. South of Mount San Antonio, San Antonio Creek drains the mountains, cutting the deep San Antonio Canyon.\\r\\nEast of San Antonio Canyon, the range gradually loses elevation, and the highest peaks in this section of the mountain range are in the south, rising dramatically above the Inland Empire cities of Claremont, Upland and Rancho Cucamonga. However, there are still several notable peaks in this region, including Telegraph Peak, at 8,985 feet (2,739?m), Cucamonga Peak, at 8,859 feet (2,700?m), and Ontario Peak, rising 8,693 feet (2,650?m). Lytle Creek, flowing generally southeast, drains most of the extreme eastern San Gabriels. The range terminates at Cajon Pass, through which runs Interstate 15, and beyond which rise the even higher San Bernardino Mountains.\\r\\nThe Range is bound on the north by the Antelope Valley and the Mojave Desert and to the south by the communities of greater Los Angeles area. In the western portion of the San Gabriel Mountain Range, the Sierra Pelona Ridge stretches from approximately Soledad Canyon (14 Freeway and railroad right-of-way), formed by the Santa Clara River. The Sierra Pelona Ridge includes Liebre Mountain, Sawmill Mountain, Grass Mountain, Redrock Peak, Burnt Peak, most of which is part of the Angeles National Forest, but also features several rural communities.\\r\\nMelting snow and rain runoff on the south side of the San Gabriels' highest mountains give rise to its largest river, the San Gabriel River. Just to the west of Mount Hawkins, a north-south divide separates water running down the two main forks of the river and their tributaries. The West Fork, beginning at Red Box Saddle, runs 14 miles (23?km) eastward, and the East Fork, starting north of Mount San Antonio, flows 18 miles (29?km) south and west through a steep, rugged and precipitous gorge. The two meet at San Gabriel Reservoir, and turn south, boring through the southern portion of the San Gabriels, emptying out of the mountains near Azusa into the urban San Gabriel Valley, and eventually to the Pacific Ocean near Seal Beach.\\r\\nSan Gabriel Mountains peaks within the Angeles National Forest include:\\r\\nThe climate of the range is Mediterranean, with mostly dry summers (except for rare summer thunderstorms) and cold, wet winters. Snow can fall above 4,000 feet elevation during frontal passages between November and April, but is most common in December through March. Annual precipitation totals are mostly above 25 inches above 3,000 feet elevation, with up to 40 inches falling in some areas above 5,000 feet. The coastal (south) side of the range receives more precipitation than the desert (northern) side. The highest precipitation is found in the central and eastern parts of the range (Mt. Wilson to Mt. San Antonio). Annual precipitation totals can be extremely high during wet \\"El Nino\\" years, sometimes over 70 inches, with single storm totals over 10 inches. Runoff from the mountains during big storms often produces flooding in adjacent foothill communities (especially in areas denuded by wildfires). Fires are a problem during summer and fall, before the rains come, especially during dry \\"Santa Ana\\" wind events. The range is mostly smog free above 5,000 feet elevation, above the inversion layer. The large telescope installation at Mt. Wilson is a testimony to the clear atmospheric conditions that prevail, although light pollution from the L.A. basin below has hindered telescope activities in recent decades.\\r\\nGranitic and metasedimentary rocks are the primary constituent of the San Gabriel Mountains. These rocks, of upper Precambrian to Mesozoic age, are the remnants of the ancient North American platform that used to reach into California. Like nearly all of the other mountains in the Transverse Ranges, the San Gabriels are a series of fault blocks there were uplifted in the Cenozoic.[4]\\r\\nThere are both areas of conifer as well as broadleaf forestation, including the presence of some endemic taxa. Conifer (pine, fir, cedar) and oak forests are most widespread above 5,000 feet where the precipitation is above 30 inches (the central and eastern high San Gabriels). In the wetter areas, madrone and bay laurel trees also occur in places, and ferns are common. Trees like willow, alder and cottonwood are also found throughout the range along the stream courses (riparian habitat), even at lower elevations. Chaparral (dense shrub, brush and small tree) vegetation is widespread where there is not continuous tall tree cover, especially at lower elevations. Chaparral is highly adapted to fire, and replaces trees for decades after fires. There is a subspecies of the Leather Oak which is found only within the San Gabriel Mountains.[5] The Rift Zone along the San Andreas Fault produces numerous springs, sag ponds, and wetland areas that are critical habitat for a variety of native species.\\r\\nLarger animals include mule deer, black bear, coyote and the rarely seen puma (mountain lion or cougar). Smaller mammals include raccoon, opossum, skunk and bobcats. Golden and bald eagles are found rarely, but hawks are common. Rattlesnakes are common, and one should be on the lookout for them when hiking.\\r\\nThe main road that runs through the San Gabriel Mountains is the Angeles Crest Highway, State Route 2. It starts in the southwest at the city of La Ca?ada Flintridge and ends at its junction with State Route 138, just past Wrightwood, near the Victor Valley and the West Cajon Valley. Past its junction with Angeles Forest Highway, traveling east, Angeles Crest Highway features blind curves, various bumps, and potholes. This section of the \\"Crest\\" is closed during the winter due to rockfall and avalanche hazards. State Route 2, just past Mountain High, is called the Big Pines Highway all the way to the Route 138 junction.\\r\\nAnother key county route which connects Angelenos to, and through, the mountains is Angeles Forest Highway. Angeles Forest Highway begins 11 miles northeast of La Ca?ada Flintridge at its Angeles Crest Highway junction. Ending near Acton, it allows easy access to the central Forest and the fast-growing Antelope Valley. Because the \\"Forest\\" and the 11 mile \\"Crest\\" portion leading to La Ca?ada Flintridge is well traveled by Antelope Valley commuters, its road maintenance is much better, and it is open much of the winter.\\r\\nState Route 39 connected the city of Azusa with the Angeles Crest Highway until it was seriously damaged by landslides, first in 1978, and again in 2005. The highway was opened to emergency crews in February 2003. The proposed State Route 39 Roadway Rehabilitation Project would begin five miles (8?km) north of Crystal Lake Recreation Area Campground.[citation needed]\\r\\nPeople heading to Mount Waterman must now travel west to Pasadena and then travel on the Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) in La Canada Flintridge - a nearly two-hour trip. Reopening Highway 39 would cut the drive-time to the Waterman Ski Area in half and shorten the trip east to Wrightwood.\\r\\nAccording to the Caltrans District Seven \\"Inside Seven\\" Newsletter, \\"Two projects that will address those issues and get the highway reopened are scheduled for construction soon. The first, building two retaining walls near the city of Azusa from Old San Gabriel Canyon Road to approximately four miles south of SR-2, could begin in mid-2009. The second, a $45 million project to reconstruct the roadway, construct soldier pile retaining walls, repair drainage systems, install rock fall protection, and provide asphalt concrete overlay and traffic striping, should begin in fall 2010.\\"(source)\\r\\nIn 2011, the planned repair of the road was abruptly terminated, due to concern of high future maintenance costs, and potential impact on the local bighorn sheep population. However, in October 2016, Caltrans announced it was again considering plans to re-open the road, after pressure from local communities.[6]\\r\\nIn the winter, snowboarding and skiing are quite popular in the San Gabriels, at Mountain High and Mt. Baldy.[citation needed] The two other resorts, Mount Waterman and Kratka Ridge, are rarely open. In the summer, \\"canyoneering\\", hiking, backpacking, picnicking and camping are some of the activities popular with visitors.[citation needed] From time to time, a hiker gets lost or stuck on a mountain ledge, or may fall downhill. Some of the more extreme cases of emergency search-and-rescue efforts will often be given air time on Los Angeles television and radio newscasts. The Pacific Crest Trail passes along the mountain ridge.\\r\\nDuring the winter, many Southern California mountaineers climb a variety of snow routes and even some ice routes in the San Gabriel Mountains. Baldy Bowl is by far the most popular route, getting hundreds of climbers per season.[citation needed] There are many other routes, offering a variety of choices.\\r\\nRock climbing is not as common in the San Gabriel Range as it is in neighboring areas, as this range is famous for loose rock. Various faults crisscross the range, making it one of the steepest and fastest-growing ranges in the world [citation needed]. Plate tectonic activity breaks up most rock, making it unsuitable for rock climbing. Williamson Rock was the most famous climbing area, until it was closed for climbing. There are many other craggy areas scattered about the range that provide mostly traditional climbing opportunities.\\r\\nAngeles National Forest Fire Lookout Association has rebuilt and operates Vetter Mountain Lookout, and Slide Mountain Lookout.

The New England colonies were part of the Thirteen Colonies and eventually became five of the six states in New England.[1] Captain John Smith's 1616 work A Description of New England first applied the term \\"New England\\"[2] to the coastal lands from Long Island Sound to Newfoundland.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance, England, and other countries made several attempts to colonize New England early in the 17th century, and those nations were often in contention for lands in the New World. French nobleman Pierre Dugua Sieur de Monts established a settlement on Saint Croix Island, Maine in June 1604 under the authority of the King of France. Nearly half the settlers perished due to the harsh winter and scurvy, and the survivors moved north out of New England to Port-Royal of Nova Scotia (see symbol \\"R\\" on map to the right) in the spring of 1605.[4]\\r\\nKing James I of England recognized the need for a permanent settlement in New England, and he granted competing royal charters to the Plymouth Company and the London Company. The Plymouth Company ships arrived at the mouth of the Kennebec River (then called the Sagadahoc River) in August 1607 where they established a settlement named Sagadahoc Colony, better known as Popham Colony (see symbol \\"Po\\" on map to right) to honor financial backer Sir John Popham. The colonists faced a harsh winter, the loss of supplies following a storehouse fire, and mixed relations with the local Indian tribes.\\r\\nColony leader Captain George Popham died, and Raleigh Gilbert decided to return to England to take up an inheritance left by the death of an older brotherat which point, all of the colonists decided to return to England. It was around August 1608 when they left on the ship Mary and John and on a new ship built by the colony named Virginia of Sagadahoc. The 30-ton Virginia was the first sea-going ship ever built in North America.[5]\\r\\nConflict over land rights continued through the early 17th century, with the French constructing Fort Pentagouet near Castine, Maine in 1613. The fort protected a trading post and a fishing station and was the first longer-term settlement in New England. It changed hands multiple times throughout the 17th century among the English, French, and Dutch colonists.[6]\\r\\nIn 1614, Dutch explorer Adriaen Block traveled along the coast of Long Island Sound and then up the Connecticut River to Hartford, Connecticut. By 1623, the Dutch West India Company regularly traded for furs there, and they eventually fortified it for protection from the Pequot Indians and named the site \\"House of Hope\\" (also identified as \\"Fort Hoop,\\" \\"Good Hope,\\" and \\"Hope\\").[7]\\r\\nA group of Puritans known as the Pilgrims arrived on the Mayflower from England and the Netherlands to establish Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts, the second successful English colony in North America following Jamestown, Virginia. About half of the one hundred-plus passengers on the Mayflower died that first winter, mostly because of diseases contracted on the voyage followed by a harsh winter.[8] In 1621, an American Indian named Squanto taught the colonists how to grow corn and where to catch eels and fish. His assistance was invaluable and helped them to survive the early years of the colonization. The Pilgrims lived on the same site where Squanto's Patuxet tribe had established a village before they were wiped out from diseases.[9]\\r\\nThe Plymouth settlement faced great hardships and earned few profits, but it enjoyed a positive reputation in England and may have sown the seeds for further immigration. Edward Winslow and William Bradford published an account of their experiences called Mourt's Relation (1622).[10] This book was only a small glimpse of the hardships and dangers encountered by the Pilgrims, but it encouraged other Puritans to immigrate during the Great Migration.\\r\\nThe Puritans in England first sent smaller groups in the mid-1620s to establish colonies, buildings, and food supplies, learning from the Pilgrims' harsh experiences of winter in the Plymouth Colony. In 1623, the Plymouth Council for New England (successor to the Plymouth Company) established a small fishing village at Cape Ann under the supervision of the Dorchester Company. The first group of Puritans moved to a new town at nearby Naumkeag after the Dorchester Company dropped support, and fresh financial support was found by Rev. John White. Other settlements were started in nearby areas; however, the overall Puritan population remained small through the 1620s.[11]\\r\\nA larger group of Puritans arrived in 1630, leaving England because they desired to worship in a manner that differed from the Church of England. Their views were in accord with those of the Pilgrims who arrived on the Mayflower, except that the Pilgrims were \\"separatists\\" who felt that they needed to separate themselves from the Church of England, whereas the later Puritans were content to remain under the umbrella of the Church of England. The separate colonies were governed independently of one other until 1691, when Plymouth Colony was absorbed into the Massachusetts Bay Colony to form the Province of Massachusetts Bay.\\r\\nEarly dissenters of the Puritan laws were often banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Connecticut Colony was started after Puritan minister Thomas Hooker left Massachusetts Bay with about 100 followers in search of greater religious and political freedom. John Wheelwright left with his followers to a colony in New Hampshire and then on to Maine. The Puritans also established the American public school system for the express purpose of ensuring that future generations would be able to read the Bible for themselves, which was a central tenet of Puritan worship.[12]\\r\\nIt was the dead of winter in January 1636 when minister Roger Williams was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony because of theological differences. One source of contention was his view that government and religion should be separate; he also believed that the colonies should purchase land at fair prices from the Wampanoag and Narragansett tribes. He escaped being deported to England by the Massachusetts officials and walked from Salem, Massachusetts to Raynham, Massachusetts, a distance of 55 miles through the deep snow. The Indian tribes helped him to survive and sold him land for a new colony which he named Providence Plantations in recognition of the intervention of Divine Providence in establishing the new colony. It was unique in its day in expressly providing for religious freedom and a separation of church from state. Other dissenters established two settlements on Rhode Island (now called Aquidneck Island) and another settlement in Warwick; these four settlements eventually united to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.[13]\\r\\nThomas Hooker left Massachusetts in 1636 with 100 followers and founded a settlement just north of the Dutch Fort Hoop which grew into Connecticut Colony. The community was first named Newtown then renamed Hartford to honor the English town of Hertford. One of the reasons why Hooker left was that only members of the church could vote and participate in the government in Massachusetts Bay, which he believed should include any adult male owning property. The Connecticut Colony was not the first settlement in Connecticut (the Dutch were first) or even the first English settlement (Windsor was first in 1633). Thomas Hooker obtained a royal charter and established Fundamental Orders, considered to be one of the first constitutions in North America. Other colonies later merged into the royal charter for the Connecticut Colony, including New Haven and Saybrook.\\r\\nThe earliest colonies in New England were usually fishing villages or farming communities on the more fertile land along the rivers. The rocky soil in the New England Colonies was not as fertile as the Middle or Southern Colonies, but the land provided rich resources, including lumber that was valued for building homes and ships. Lumber was also a resource that could be exported back to England, where there was a shortage of wood. In addition, the hunting of wildlife provided furs to be traded and food for the table.\\r\\nIn Massachusetts their economy was heavily based on small industries with people working as porters, tanners, shopkeepers and metalworkers. They had merchants which carried raw materials such as furs, timber, and the tar and pitch needed for shipbuilding. Trade went on directly between the English colonists and the European Caribbean islands.\\r\\nThe New England Colonies were located near the ocean where there was an abundance of whales, fish, and other marketable sea life. Excellent harbors and some inland waterways offered protection for ships and were also valuable for fresh water fishing. By the end of the 17th century, New England colonists had created an Atlantic trade network that connected them to the English homeland as well as the West African slave coast, the Caribbean's plantation islands, and the Iberian Peninsula. Colonists relied upon British and European imports for glass, linens, hardware, machinery, and other items for the colonial household.\\r\\nThe Southern Colonies could produce tobacco, rice, and indigo in exchange for imports, whereas New England's colonies could not offer much to England beyond fish, furs, and lumber. Inflation was a major issue in the economy. During the 18th century, shipbuilding drew upon the abundant lumber and revived the economy, often under the direction of the British Crown.[14]\\r\\nEnslavement of enemies defeated in war was a common practice in European nations at this time. This was a policy that had been going on for decades in Ireland, particularly since the time of Elizabeth I and during the mid-17th century Cromwell wars in Britain and Ireland, where large numbers of Irish, Welsh, and Scots prisoners of war were sent as slaves to plantations in the West Indies, especially to Barbados and Jamaica.[15] The practice found its way to the American colonies during the Pequot War and King Philip's War.\\r\\nMilitary leader Benjamin Church spoke out against enslaving Indians in the summer of 1675, describing the practice as \\"an action so hateful that (I) opposed it to the loss of the good will and respect of some that before were (my) good friends.\\" This said, Church was an owner of African slaves himself, like many Englishmen in the colony.[16] Ships carrying captured war combatants began to leave New England ports during King Philip's War (1675-78) and continued for the three years of the war. The policy concerning war enemies was that \\"no male captive above the age of fourteen years should reside in the colony.\\"[17] It is estimated that at least a thousand New England Indian warriors were sold as slaves during King Philip's War, with over half of those coming from Plymouth.[18]\\r\\nIn the New England Colonies, the first settlements of Pilgrims and the other Puritans who came later taught their children how to read and write in order that they might read and study the Bible for themselves. Depending upon social and financial status, education was taught by the parents home-schooling their children, public grammar schools, and private governesses, which included subjects from reading and writing to Latin and Greek and more.","input":"What religious groups lived in the new england colonies?"},{"output":"Kenny Dalglish","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scotland national football team is the joint-oldest international football team, having played in the first official international match, a goalless draw on 30 November 1872 against England.[1]  Since then, the team has established a long-standing rivalry with England, particularly in the annual British Home Championship, which Scotland won 24 times outright and shared a further 17 times.[2] The team has enjoyed less success in continental and global competition.

The modern site is protected and can be visited as part of the County's Philippe Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the early 16th century Spanish explorers discovered and slowly began exploring Florida, including Tampa Bay. In 1528 Panfilo de Narvaez landed in Pinellas, and 10 years later Hernando de Soto is thought to have explored the Tampa Bay Area. By the early 18th century the Tocobaga had been virtually annihilated, having fallen victim to European diseases from which they had no immunity, as well as European conflicts. Later Spanish explorers named the area Punta Pi?al (Spanish for \\"Point of Pines\\" or \\"Piney Point\\"). After trading hands multiple times between the British and the Spanish, Spain finally ceded Florida to the United States in 1821, and in 1823 the U.S. Army established Fort Brooke (later Tampa).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1834 much of west central Florida, including the Pinellas peninsula (then known simply as West Hillsborough), was organized as Hillsborough County. The very next year Odet Philippe became the first permanent, non-native resident of the peninsula when he established a homestead near the site of the Tocobaga village in Safety Harbor. It was Philippe who first introduced both citrus culture and cigar-making to Florida.[7][8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the same time, the United States Army began construction of Fort Harrison, named after William Henry Harrison, as a rest post for soldiers from nearby Fort Brooke during the Second Seminole War. The new fort was located on a bluff overlooking Clear Water Harbor, which later became part of an early 20th-century residential development (now historic district) called Harbor Oaks. University of South Florida archaeologists excavated the site in 1977 after Alfred C. Wyllie discovered an underground ammunition bunker while digging a swimming pool on his estate. Clearwater would later become the first organized community on the peninsula as well as the site of its first post office.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Armed Occupation Act, passed in 1842, encouraged further settlement of Pinellas, like all of Florida, by offering 160 acres (0.65?km2) to anyone who would bear arms and cultivate the land. Pioneer families like the Booths, the Coachmans, the Marstons, and the McMullens established homesteads in the area in the years following, planting more citrus groves and raising cattle. During the American Civil War, many residents fought for the Confederate States of America. Brothers James and Daniel McMullen [10] were members of the Confederate Cow Cavalry, driving Florida cattle to Georgia and the Carolinas to help sustain the war effort. John W. Marston served in the 9th Florida Regiment as a part of the Appomattox Campaign. Many other residents served in other capacities. Otherwise the peninsula had virtually no significance during the war, and the war largely passed the area by.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nTarpon Springs became West Hillsborough's first incorporated city in 1887, and in 1888 the Orange Belt Railway was extended into the southern portion of the peninsula. Railroad owner Peter Demens named the town that grew near the railroad's terminus St. Petersburg in honor of his hometown. The town would incorporate in 1892. Other major towns in the county incorporated during this time were Clearwater (1891), Dunedin (1899), and Largo (1905).\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction of Fort De Soto, on Mullet Key facing the mouth of Tampa Bay, was begun in 1898 during the SpanishÿAmerican War to protect Tampa Bay from potential invading forces. The fort, a subpost of Fort Dade on adjacent Egmont Key (which lies in the mouth of Tampa Bay), was equipped with artillery and mortar batteries.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nEven into the early years of the 20th century, West Hillsborough had no paved roads, and transportation posed a major challenge. A trip to the county seat, across the bay in Tampa, was generally an overnight affair and the automobiles that existed on the peninsula at that time would frequently become bogged down in the muck after rainstorms. Angry at what was perceived as neglect by the county government, residents of Pinellas began a push to secede from Hillsborough. They succeeded, and on January 1, 1912 Pinellas County came into being.[13][14] The peninsula, along with a small part of the mainland were incorporated into the new county.\\r\\n\\r\\nAviation history was made in St. Petersburg on January 1, 1914 when Tony Jannus made the world's first scheduled commercial airline flight with the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line from St. Petersburg to Tampa. The popular open-air St. Petersburg concert venue Jannus Live (formerly known as \\"Jannus Landing\\") memorializes the flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early 1920s saw the beginning of a land boom in much of Florida, including Pinellas. During this period municipalities issued a large number of bonds to keep pace with the needed infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. The travel time to Tampa was cut in halffrom 43 to 19 miles (69 to 31?km)by the opening of the Gandy Bridge in 1924, along the same route Jannus' airline used. It was the longest automobile toll bridge in the world at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nProhibition was unpopular in the area and the peninsula's countless inlets and islands became havens for rumrunners bringing in liquor from Cuba. Others distilled moonshine in the County's still plentiful woods.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs was the case in much of Florida, the Great Depression came early to Pinellas with the collapse of the real estate boom in 1926. Local economies came into severe difficulties, and by 1930, St. Petersburg defaulted on its bonds. Only after World War II would significant growth return to the area. During the war, the area's tourist industry collapsed, but thousands of recruits came to the area when the U.S. military decided to use the area for training. Area hotels became barracks. The Vinoy Park Hotel was used as an Army training school. The area's women and girls participated in the war effort as well. Hundreds of girls from the area's most prominent families formed a group called the Bomb-a-Dears, holding dances, socializing with recruits, and selling war bonds.[16] After the war many of these same soldiers remembered their war time experience in Pinellas well, and returned as tourists or residents.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the end of the Second World War, Pinellas would enter another period of rapid growth and development. In 1954 the original span of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge was opened, replacing earlier ferry service. By 1957 Clearwater was America's fastest growing city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council was founded by the late mayor of St. Petersburg, Herman Goldner, who sought without success during the 1960s to consolidate various municipalities and unincorporated areas in south Pinellas County. Each year the council presents its Herman Goldner Award for Regional Leadership.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nTragedy struck on May 9, 1980, when the southbound span of the original Sunshine Skyway Bridge was struck by the freighter MV Summit Venture during a storm, sending over 1,200 feet (370?m) of the bridge plummeting into Tampa Bay. The collision caused ten cars and a Greyhound bus to fall 150 feet (46?m) into the water, killing 35 people.[18][19] The new bridge opened in 1987 and has since been listed as #3 of the \\"Top 10 Bridges\\" in the World by the Travel Channel.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe county operates a 21-acre (8.5?ha) living history museum called Heritage Village containing more than 28 historic structures, some dating back to the 19th century, where visitors can experience what life was once like in Pinellas.\\r\\n\\r\\nPinellas County celebrated 100 years of existence on January 1, 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 608 square miles (1,570?km2), of which 274 square miles (710?km2) is land and 334 square miles (870?km2) (55.0%) is water.[21] It is the second-smallest county in Florida by land area, larger than only \\r\\nUnion County. Pinellas forms a peninsula bounded on the west by the Gulf of Mexico and on the south and east by Tampa Bay. It is 38 miles (61?km) long and 15 miles (24?km) wide at its broadest point, with 587 miles (945?km) of coastline.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nElevation in the county ranges from mean sea level to its highest natural point of 110 feet (34?m) near the intersection of SR 580 and Countryside Blvd. in Clearwater.[23] Due to its small size and high population, by the early 21st century Pinellas County has been mostly built out, with very little developable land left available. The county has maintained a fairly large system of parks and preserves that provide residents and visitors retreat from the city and a glimpse of the peninsula's original state.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeologically, Pinellas is underlain by a series of limestone formations, the Hawthorne limestone and the Tampa limestone. The limestone is porous and stores a large quantity of water. The Hawthorne formation forms a prominent ridge down the spine of the county, from east of Dunedin, south to the Walsingham area and east towards St. Petersburg.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 35 miles of beaches and dunes which make up the county's 11 barrier islands provide habitat for coastal species, serve as critical storm protection for the inland communities, and form the basis of the area's thriving tourism industry. The islands are dynamic, with wave action building some islands further up, eroding others, and forming entirely new islands over time. Though hurricanes are infrequent on this part of Florida's coast, they have had a major impact on the islands, with the Hurricane of 1848 forming John's Pass between Madeira Beach and Treasure Island, a hurricane in 1921 creating Hurricane Pass and cleaving Hog Island into Honeymoon and Caladesi Islands, and 1985's Hurricane Elena sealing Dunedin Pass to join Caladesi with Clearwater Beach.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the barrier islands and the peninsula are several bodies of water, through which traverses a section of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. From north to south they are: St. Joseph Sound between the islands and Dunedin, Clearwater Harbor between Clearwater and Clearwater Beach, and Boca Ciega Bay in the southern third of the county. Connecting Clearwater Harbor to Boca Ciega Bay is a thin, approximately 3.5-mile (5.6?km) stretch of water known as The Narrows, which runs next to the town of Indian Shores.\\r\\n\\r\\nExtending from northeastern Boca Ciega Bay, Long Bayou separates Seminole from St. Petersburg near Bay Pines. Long Bayou once extended significantly farther up the peninsula until the northern portion was sealed off to create Lake Seminole. Extending further still from Long Bayou, the Cross Bayou Canal traverses the peninsula, crossing Pinellas Park in a northeasterly direction before emptying into Tampa Bay on the northwest side of St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport.\\r\\n\\r\\n[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnderson Park Panorama\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooker Creek Nature Preserve walkway\\r\\n\\r\\nView of Lake Tarpon from John Chestnut Park\\r\\n\\r\\nWall Springs View of St Joseph Sound from the old observation tower\\r\\n\\r\\nBoyd Hill Nature Preserve- A 245-acre park on the shores of Lake Maggiore in south St. Petersburg, operated by the city and featuring a nature center, bird-of-prey aviary, and over three miles of trails through a variety of ecosystems.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nHillsborough County extends along the shipping channel into the Gulf of Mexico and actually separates Pinellas County from Manatee County.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral natural communities exist within the county, including areas of freshwater wetlands (dominated by bald cypresses and ferns), coastal mangrove swamps, sporadic hardwood hammocks (dominated by laurel oaks and live oaks, cabbage palms, and southern magnolias), low-lying, poorly drained pine flatwoods (dominated by longleaf pines and saw palmettos), and well-drained, upland sandhills (dominated by longleaf pines and turkey oaks) and sand pine scrub (dominated by sand pines, saw palmettos, and various oaks). Offshore ecosystems include the Tampa Bay estuary and numerous gulf seagrass beds. The county also maintains several artificial reefs\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous bird species can be sighted in Pinellas, either as permanent residents or during the winter migration, including wading birds like great blue herons, egrets, white ibises and roseate spoonbills, aquatic birds like brown pelicans, white pelicans, and cormorants, numerous species of shorebirds, and very-common birds like seagulls and passerines like the blue jay, mockingbird, and crow. Ospreys are a commonly seen bird-of-prey, with other birds of prey like turkey vultures, red tailed hawks, great horned owls, screech owls, barn owls, and bald eagles, among others, seen as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nGopher tortoises are found in many areas, the burrows they dig making them a keystone species. Coyotes, though often associated with the American West, are native-to and can be found in Pinellas. White-tailed deer, wild turkeys, bobcats, otters, and alligators can be found in the county as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nSea turtles nest on the shores or Pinellas' barrier islands and have been threatened by development. Offshore, dolphins, sharks, and manatees are numerous as well, while closer inshore stingrays are a common sight, leading those in-the-know to do the \\"stingray shuffle\\" (shuffling up the sand to scare nearby stingrays off) when entering gulf waters. Species of fish commonly caught in the waters surrounding the county include spotted seatrout, red drum or redfish, snook, pompano, sheepshead, Spanish mackerel, grouper, mullet, flounder, kingfish, and tarpon.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike much of Florida, Pinellas County is home to several invasive species that propagate easily outside their (and their natural predators') native range. Examples of commonly seen invasives include Brazilian pepper, water hyacinth, Australian pine, melaleuca\\r\\nand air potato. These species are considered serious pests, and varying methods have been tried to eradicate them. Examples of invasive animals include the wild boar, which poses significant health and agricultural problems in Florida and can sometimes be found in Pinellas, and the monk parakeet, small flocks of which can sometimes be seen in flight or building nests on electrical poles or telecommunications towers.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nPinellas gained some national attention as the home of the Mystery Monkey of Tampa Bay, a non-native, feral rhesus macaque that had been on the loose for approximately three years in the south of the county. No one was sure where the monkey came from, and a Facebook page set up for the monkey had over 84,000 likes (as of October 2012). The monkey was the subject of a sketch on the March 11, 2010 episode of the Colbert Report. As of February 2012, the monkey had apparently taken up semi-permanent residence behind a family's home at an undisclosed location in St. Petersburg, according to the Tampa Bay Times.[29] Efforts to capture the monkey were reignited after it reportedly bit a woman living near where it had taken up residence, and the monkey was captured in late October 2012 and eventually was sent to live at Dade City's Wild Things, a 22-acre (8.9?ha) zoo north of Tampa.\\r\\n\\r\\nPinellas, like the rest of the Tampa Bay area, has a humid subtropical climate, resulting in warm, humid summers with frequent thunderstorms, and drier winters. Pinellas County's geographic position- lying on a peninsula between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico introduces large amounts of humidity into the atmosphere and serves to moderate temperatures. The geography of the peninsula also causes some variance in the county's average temperatures. St. Petersburg, further south on the peninsula, tends to have warmer daily average lows (by about 3 degrees) than areas such as Dunedin and Palm Harbor further north, though daily highs are very close. The north of the county also has fewer overall days of rain, but higher total annual precipitation when measured in inches, the county's south being prone to shorter, more frequent thunderstorms especially in the late summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreezing temperatures occur only every 2ÿ3 years, with freezing precipitation occurring extremely rarely. Springs are usually short, mild, and dry, with occasional late-season cold fronts. Summertime weather is very consistent, with highs in the low 90s F (around 32?C), lows in the mid-70s F (around 24?C), accompanied by high humidity and an almost daily chance of afternoon thundershowers. The area experiences significant rainfall during its summer months (approximately May through October), with nearly two-thirds of annual precipitation falling between the months of June and September. The area is occasionally affected by tropical storms and hurricanes, but has not suffered a direct hit since 1921. Fall, like spring, is usually mild and dry, with the hurricane season extending through November and sometimes affecting the area.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany portions of south Pinellas, especially near the bay and gulf, have tropical microclimates. Tropical trees such as coconut palms and royal palms and fruit trees like mangoes grow very well in these microclimates.\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. Census Bureau 2010 Ethnic/Race Demographics:[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, 6.5% of the population considered themselves to be of only \\"American\\" ancestry (regardless of race or ethnicity.)[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were 415,876 households out of which 19.89% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.33% were married couples living together, 11.86% had a female householder with no husband present, and 43.67% were non-families. 35.42% of all households were made up of individuals and 15.14% (4.53% male and 10.61% female) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

However, for the last quarter-century, it has been a powerful swing county in one of the nation's most critical swing states.  It is closely divided between predominantly liberal St. Petersburg and its predominantly suburban and conservative north and beaches. In the 2012 Presidential Election, Barack Obama won Pinellas with 52% of the vote (239,104 votes) to Mitt Romney's 46.5% (213,258 votes), slightly narrower than Obamas 2008 election results in Pinellas of 53% (248,299 votes) to John McCains 45% (210,066 votes). In 2004 Pinellas swung the other way, with George W. Bush winning a narrow plurality of 49.56% (225,686 votes) and John Kerry following closely behind with 49.51% (225,460 votes).[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2012 U.S. Senate election, Pinellas voters helped re-elect U.S. Senator Bill Nelson over challenger Connie Mack IV with 59% of the vote, greater than his statewide average of 55%. In the 2010 Senate Election, Pinellas was one of only four Florida counties won by outgoing Republican Governor Charlie Crist, a St. Petersburg native, who won 42% of Pinellas voters running as an Independent in a three-way race with Republican nominee (and eventual winner) Marco Rubio and former Democratic U.S. Representative Kendrick Meek, who won 37% and 16.8% of the Pinellas vote, respectively. Statewide, Rubio won almost 49% of the vote to Crist's 29.7% and Meek's 20%[51] in a highly polarized election that would witness Crist depart from the Republican Party and eventually become a Democrat.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nPortions of Pinellas fall into Florida's 12th and 13th congressional districts, served by Republican Gus Bilirakis and Democrat Crist.  A court-ordered remap merged most of the 14th's share of Pinellas into the 13th, enabling Crist to defeat Republican incumbent David Jolly in the 2016 election, breaking a 62-year GOP hold on what is now the 13th.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn state politics, portions of Pinellas are represented in the Florida Senate by Democratic State Senator Arthenia Joyner (District 19) and Republican State Senators Jack Latvala (District 20) and Jeff Brandes (District 22).

A larger car than its predecessor, the North American Accord was given a new level of refinement with chrome interior accents and higher grade materials.[4] The lineup still included all the same trim levels as the previous generation, the DX, LX, EX, LX-V6 and EX-V6.[5]\\r\\nMechanically, the 4-cylinder engine was the all new K-series. For the first time the 4-cylinder Accord gained a direct ignition (distributorless) coil-on-plug ignition system, which had previously been introduced on the V6. The direct ignition system provides a slight horsepower and fuel economy gain, as well as improved long-term reliability, relative to the traditional system with a distributor and spark plug wires. In addition, Honda provided a new recommendation for engine oil viscosity, 5W-20 instead of the previous 5W-30 viscosity. Because of the lower viscosity, engine parts move with less friction, which increases fuel economy. Together with other improvements, this change effected an increase from the previous generation's (with VTEC 4-cylinder F23A1 engine and the manual transmission) 22mpg city/29 hwy rating, to 23mpg city/31 hwy, according to 2008 EPA ratings. The 4-cylinder engine could be mated to a 5-speed manual transmission or to a 5-speed automatic transmission with overdrive (also new for 2003). A specific 4-cylinder model was the first production car in the world to meet California's Super Ultra Low Emissions standards.\\r\\nThe 6-cylinder models had the same J-series V6 as the sixth generation's, but revisions to the intake and exhaust systems contributed to a 40?hp increase, bringing the total power to 240?hp. The revised exhaust manifold actually became part of the cylinder head casting itself. Six-cylinder Accords generally had a version of the new 5-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, except for the coupe described below, which could be purchased with a 6-speed manual transmission. With the V6 engine and automatic transmission, the Accord achieved a 21mpg city/30 hwy fuel economy rating.\\r\\nThe 2003 model year also debuted Honda's GPS assisted Navigation system as an option for the Accord. Prior to 2003, it was only available on the higher end Acura line and the Honda Odyssey. In 2004 Honda also first offered XM Satellite Radio as a factory installed option.\\r\\nFor 2005, the Accord received several updates, including standard side curtain and front seat side impact airbags for a total of six airbags, revised (all red) taillights for the sedan (coupe taillights remained unchanged), more chrome on the grille, and new wheel designs for LX, LX-V6 and EX-V6 models. A new Accord Hybrid was introduced for the first time, with stylish new wheels, an EPA gas mileage of 29 City/37 HWY, and the same 3.0 liter motor as the regular V6 Accord models, but with increased horsepower. The hybrid version of the V6 produced 255?hp, an increase of 15?hp, making the hybrid quicker than the regular Accord V6 sedan, but still not as quick as the Accord Coupe V6 with 6 speed manual.\\r\\nFor the first time, Honda offered an \\"enthusiast\\" version of the Accord in the US, adding a sports suspension and mating the 6-speed manual transmission from the Acura CL to a 3.2L V-6 engine. The Honda Accord Coupe was unveiled as a performance concept at the 2002 SEMA show.[6] Powertrain and chassis modifications included a high-flow intake and exhaust, 295?bhp (220?kW) 3.2L V-6 engine, limited slip differential, semi-manual 6-speed transmission, prototype 8-piston Brembo brakes, and a lowered racing suspension and widened track. Exterior modifications included a carbon fiber body kit (including the bumpers, side sills, grill and underbody diffuser), dual aluminum integrated exhaust ports, aluminum/carbon fiber rear wing, black chrome finish headlights and taillights, 20-inch black chrome wheels, Bridgestone Potenza S03 235/45 ZR20 tires, and fender flares and NSX Spa Yellow paint. Interior modifications included an F1-style paddle shifter on the steering wheel, prototype multifunction meter display with on-board diagnostics, Sparco carbon/Kevlar backed bucket seats covered in Alcantera suede, 4-point front seat harnesses, three-spoke racing steering wheel, and aluminum sport pedals.\\r\\nThe Factory Performance Package was a dealer option based on the SEMA concept car, available for 2003 Accord V-6 Coupe LX and EX with either manual or automatic transmissions. Chassis/exterior changes included Factory Performance suspension (shock absorbers, springs), underbody aero kit, 17-inch alloy wheels, 215/50VR-17 high-performance tires, and a rear wing spoiler. Interior accessories included a factory performance shift knob and trim.[6]\\r\\nIn 2005, for the 2006 model year, which was its 30th anniversary, the North American Accord received a mid-generational refresh, though it was fairly significant and some enthusiasts called this generation 7.5.\\r\\nThe exterior was revised with a new front grille later seen on the eighth-generation Honda Civic which also debuted that year, new rear end styling with triangular LED taillights, daytime running lights (DRLs) and heated side mirrors for US EX models.[7] Heated mirrors and DRLs were previously available only on Accords sold in Canada. The 2006 model year also featured new wheel designs, with 17\\" wheels being standard on V6 models. Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA), traction control, and Brake assist became available on the V6 models for the first time. Previously, the system was named TCS and included the traction control and brake assist, but not stability control.\\r\\nThe interior was also slightly redesigned with changes such as a new steering wheel cover, differently colored gauges and a differently styled shift knob for automatic transmission models. The GPS Navigation system was updated (4th generation) with a faster processor, more memory, and several new features, such as restaurant information from Zagat. A revised maintenance minder system was also added which gave owners reminders for scheduled maintenance such as oil changes based on operating conditions.\\r\\nPowertrain improvements were made across the Accord line-up in 2006. The V6 engine's power was increased to 244?bhp (182?kW) (+4?hp, SAE net revised 8/04*) and the 4-cylinder engine's power was increased to 166?bhp (124?kW) (+6?hp, SAE net revised 8/04*). Power gains were achieved with extensive improvements to the airflow of the intake and exhaust systems. Due to these improvements the V6 engine was renamed the J30A5 from the previous J30A4, and the 4-cylinder from the K24A4 to the K24A8. For the Brazilian market, the 2.4L engine was dropped in favour of a smaller 2.0L 4-cylinder i-VTEC K20A engine generating 148?bhp (110?kW). This was done to make the car more competitive against the newly released Ford Fusion. The 2006 model year was also the first year in which the V6 sedan was offered with a 6-speed manual transmission from the coupe as an option. The 4-cylinder Accords were now controlled with Drive-By-Wire (DBW), rather than a throttle cable, providing for smooth operation and enhanced throttle response; V6 Accords already used DBW prior to the 2006 model year.\\r\\nThe 2006 Accord Hybrid got the same revisions as the other Accords, although its engine and battery power was identically powerful to the 2005, the 2006 rating system re-rated it at 253?bhp (189?kW), and a larger battery pack was added. Features that differentiate the Hybrid from other Accords are the different rear light clusters, the antenna, the wheels, the mirror turn signals and the lack of a folding rear seat. The 2005 Hybrids also had a different storage door from other Accords, which disappeared on the 2006 version. Lastly, a sunroof was not available on the 2005 but was standard on the 2006.\\r\\nThe trim levels were also revised, with the basic Accord DX being succeeded by the VP (Value Package) trim which added air conditioning, keyless entry, power locks, and cruise control as standard features compared to the 2005 DX. In Canada, sedans came as DX-G, SE, EX-L, SE-V6, EX-L V6, EX-L V6 6MT, and the Hybrid, while coupe trims included the SE, EX-L, EX-L V6, and EX-L V6 6MT.\\r\\nFor its 2007 model year, a new SE-V6 trim was introduced.[8] The color \\"Cool Blue Metallic\\", previously only for the coupe, became available for the sedan. Despite being in its last year of the generation, the 2007 Accord was still ranked highly by reviewers, scoring slightly below the redesigned Toyota Camry in the Edmunds family sedan comparison.[9]\\r\\nHonda offered the Accord Hybrid in the United States in the 2005 through 2007 model years. Produced exclusively in Sayama, Saitama, Japan, the Accord Hybrid was the company's third hybrid model when the 2005 model was introduced in late 2004, following the Insight and Civic Hybrid.[10] The Accord Hybrid was priced US$3,000 higher than the \\"EX V6\\" model Accord, and retained substantially the same trim and feature levels (although the 2005 model did not include a power moonroof). Honda positioned the Accord Hybrid at the top of its non-Acura lineup in North America.\\r\\nWhile this new vehicle shared the same displacement as the regular Accord V6 powerplant, the engine in the hybrid was derived from the 2005 Honda Odyssey minivan and has the ability to shut off three of the six cylinders under certain conditions for better fuel economy (a technology that Honda calls VCM or Variable Cylinder Management). The new engine features iVTEC technology and drives a new compact five-speed semi-automatic transmission, developed to allow the inclusion of the electric motor sandwiched between the transversely mounted engine. Power of the gas engine is up from 240 to 255 horsepower (179 to 190?kW) and torque rose from 212 to 232 pound-feet (287 to 315?N{m). The vehicle reaches 60 miles per hour (97?km/h) in 6.5?seconds.[11] Together with the Integrated Motor Assist electric motor, the hybrid version provided slightly higher performance than the conventional V6-engined Accord. However, the marketplace did not embrace the Accord Hybrid, and the vehicle was discontinued after the 2007 model year.\\r\\nFuel economy was originally estimated at 30?mpg?US (7.8?L/100?km) city and 37?mpg?US (6.4?L/100?km) highway for the 2005 model year, but was later changed to 28?mpg?US (8.4?L/100?km) city, 35?mpg?US (6.7?L/100?km) highway, after Honda's addition of standard moonroof and spare tire during the 2006 model year. This change bumped the car to a higher weight class for United States Environmental Protection Agency mileage testing. The 2006 model has also been rated an AT-PZEV vehicle. AT-PZEV (Advanced Technology-Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle) is an emissions standard created by the California Air Resources Board. 2005 model year Accord Hybrids were rated LEVII-ULEV by the California Air Resources board and Tier2, Bin5 by the EPA.\\r\\nFor 2006, the Accord Hybrid came standard with Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA), and like the conventional Accord, received a minor exterior facelift. Accord Hybrids from model year 2006 and up can be identified by the amber rear turn signals whereas their fully gasoline counterparts have red rear turn signals.\\r\\nHonda announced the Accord Hybrid would return to market for the 2014 model year after skipping a generation, with a new dual-motor system and a plug-in option.[12]\\r\\nChanges to power rating in 2006 and later model year vehicles was caused by the use of Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J1349 (Rev 8/04) net calculations that went into effect in January 2005.[15]\\r\\nPartial Zero Emissions Vehicle versions only came in four-cylinder sedans equipped with automatic transmission. Beginning in 2004 model year, PZEV models sales began in US states of New York, Maine, Vermont and Massachusetts.[16]\\r\\nOn October 1, 2012, Honda announced a recall of 573,147 Accords in the US and 30,058 in Canada equipped with V6 engines from model years 2003 through 2007. The addition of the Accords to already recalled Acura TL cars from model years 2007 and 2008 raises the number of affected vehicles in the United States and Canada to 660,086.[17]\\r\\nRecall 11v-395 was initiated on August 4, 2011 for Accords and other Hondas with automatic transmissions. The recall was estimated to cover 1,512,107 vehicles.[18]\\r\\nRecall 14v-351 was initiated on June 19, 2014 for many Hondas involved in the Takata airbag recall.[19]","input":"What engine does a 2003 honda accord have?"},{"output":"Secretariat","context":"Sanford Stakes (1972)\\r\\nHopeful Stakes (1972)\\r\\nFuturity Stakes (1972)\\r\\nLaurel Futurity (1972)\\r\\nGarden State Futurity (1972)\\r\\nBay Shore Stakes (1973)\\r\\nGotham Stakes (1973)\\r\\nArlington Invitational (1973)\\r\\nMarlboro Cup (1973)\\r\\nMan o' War Stakes (1973)\\r\\nCanadian International (1973)\\r\\nSecretariat (March 30, 1970 ÿ October 4, 1989) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who, in 1973, became the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years. His record-breaking win in the Belmont Stakes, where he left the field 31 lengths behind him, is widely regarded as one of the greatest races of all time. During his racing career, he won five Eclipse Awards, including Horse of the Year honors at ages two and three. He was elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1974. In the List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century, Secretariat is second only to Man o' War (racing career 1919ÿ1920), who also was a large chestnut colt given the nickname \\"Big Red\\".\\r\\nAt age two, Secretariat finished fourth in his 1972 debut in a maiden race, but then won seven of his remaining eight starts, including five stakes victories. His only loss during this period was in the Champagne Stakes, where he finished first but was disqualified to second for interference. He received the Eclipse Award for champion two-year-old colt, and also was the 1972 Horse of the Year, a rare honor for a horse so young. At age three, Secretariat not only won the Triple Crown, he set speed records in all three races. His time in the Kentucky Derby still stands as the Churchill Downs track record for ?1?1?4 miles, and his time in the Belmont Stakes stands as the American record for ?1?1?2 miles on the dirt. His controversial time in the Preakness Stakes was eventually recognized as a stakes record in 2012. Secretariat's win in the Gotham Stakes tied the track record for 1 mile, he set a world record in the Marlboro Cup at ?1?1?8 miles and further proved his versatility by winning two major stakes races on turf. He lost three times that year: in the Wood Memorial, Whitney and Woodward Stakes, but the brilliance of his nine wins made him an American icon. He won his second Horse of the Year title, plus Eclipse Awards for champion three-year-old colt and champion turf horse.\\r\\nAt the beginning of his three-year-old year, Secretariat was syndicated for a record-breaking $6.08 million on condition that he be retired from racing by the end of the year. Although he sired several successful racehorses, he ultimately was most influential through his daughters' offspring, becoming the leading broodmare sire in North America in 1992. Secretariat died in 1989 due to laminitis. His daughters produced several notable sires, including Storm Cat, A.P. Indy, Gone West, Dehere and Chief's Crown, and through them Secretariat appears in the pedigree of many modern champions. He continues to be recognized as one of the greatest horses in American racing history.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSecretariat was officially bred by Christopher Chenery's Meadow Stud,[1] but the breeding was actually arranged by Penny Chenery (then known as Penny Tweedy), who had taken over the running of the stable in 1968 when her father became ill.[3] Secretariat was sired by Bold Ruler and his dam was Somethingroyal, a daughter of Princequillo. Bold Ruler was the leading sire in North America from 1963 to 1969 and again in 1973.[4] Owned by the Phipps family, Bold Ruler possessed both speed and stamina, having won the Preakness Stakes and Horse of the Year honors in 1957, and American Champion Sprint Horse honors in 1958.[5] Bold Ruler was retired to stud at Claiborne Farm, but the Phippses owned most of the mares to which Bold Ruler was bred, and few of his offspring were sold at public auction.[6] To bring new blood into their breeding program, the Phippses sometimes negotiated a foal-sharing agreement with other mare owners:[7] Instead of charging a stud fee for Bold Ruler, they would arrange for multiple matings with Bold Ruler, either with two mares in one year or one mare over a two-year period. Assuming two foals were produced, the Phipps family would keep one and the mare's owner would keep the other, with a coin toss determining who received first pick.[3][8]\\r\\nUnder such an arrangement, Chenery sent two mares to be bred to Bold Ruler in 1968, Hasty Matelda and Somethingroyal. She then sent Cicada and Somethingroyal in 1969. The foal-sharing agreement stated that the winner of the coin toss would get first foal pick of the foals produced in 1969, while the loser of the toss would get first pick of the foals due in 1970. In the spring of 1969, a colt and filly were produced. In the 1969 breeding season, Cicada did not conceive, leaving only one foal due in the spring of 1970. Thus, the winner of the coin toss would get only one foal (the first pick from 1969), and the loser would get two (the second pick from 1969 and the only foal from 1970). Chenery later said that both owners hoped they would lose the coin toss,[9] which was held in the fall of 1969 in the office of New York Racing Association Chairman Alfred G. Vanderbilt II, with Arthur \\"Bull\\" Hancock of Claiborne Farm as witness. Ogden Phipps won the toss and took the 1969 weanling filly out of Somethingroyal.[3][10] The filly was named The Bride and never won a race, though she did later become a stakes producer.[11][12] Chenery received the Hasty Matelda colt in 1969 and the as-yet-unborn 1970 foal of Somethingroyal, which turned out to be Secretariat.[3]\\r\\nOn March 30, 1970, at 12:10?a.m. at the Meadow Stud in Caroline County, Virginia, Somethingroyal foaled a bright-red chestnut colt with three white socks and a star with a narrow stripe. The foal stood when he was 45 minutes old and nursed 30 minutes later. Howard Gentry, the manager of Meadow Stud, was at the foaling and later said, \\"He was a very well-made foal. He was as perfect a foal that I ever delivered.\\"[16] The colt soon distinguished himself from the others. \\"He was always the leader in the crowd\\", said Gentry's nephew, Robert, who also worked at the farm. \\"To us, he was Big Red, and he had a personality. He was a clown and was always cutting up, always into some devilment.\\"[17] Some time later, Chenery got her first look at the foal and made a one word entry in her notebook: \\"Wow!\\"[18]\\r\\nThat fall, Chenery and Elizabeth Ham, the Meadow's longtime secretary, worked together to name the newly weaned colt. The first set of names submitted to the Jockey Club (Sceptre, Royal Line and Something Special) played on the names of his sire and dam, but were rejected. The second set, submitted in January 1971, were Games of Chance, Deo Volonti (God Willing) and Secretariat, the last suggested by Ham based on her previous job associated with the secretariat of the League of Nations (the predecessor of the United Nations).[11][19][20]\\r\\nSecretariat grew into a massive, powerful horse said to resemble his sire's maternal grandsire, Discovery. He stood 16.2?hands (66?inches, 168?cm) when fully grown.[21] He was noted for being exceptionally well-balanced, a big, powerful horse described as having \\"nearly perfect\\" conformation and stride biomechanics.[22] His chest was so large that he required a custom-made girth, and he was noted for his large, powerful, well-muscled hindquarters. An Australian trainer said of him, \\"He is incredible, an absolutely perfect horse. I never saw anything like him.\\"[23]\\r\\nSecretariat's absence of major conformation flaws was important, as horses with well made limbs and feet are less likely to become injured.[24] Secretariat's hindquarters were the main source of his power, with a sloped croup that extended the length of his femur.[25] When in full stride, his hind legs were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive.[26] His ample girth, long back and well-made neck all contributed to his heart-lung efficiency.[25][26]\\r\\nThe manner in which Secretariat's body parts fit together determined the efficiency of his stride, which affected his acceleration and endurance. Even very small differences in the length and angles of bones can have a major affect on performance.[27] Secretariat was well put together even as a two-year-old, and by the time he was three, he had further matured in body and smoothed out his gait. The New York Racing Association's Dr. M. A. Gilman, a veterinarian who routinely measured leading Thoroughbreds with a goal of applying science to create better ways to breed and evaluate racehorses, measured Secretariat's development from two to three as follows:[23][28]\\r\\nSecretariat's length of stride was considered large even after taking into account his large frame and strong build.[22] While training for the Preakness Stakes, his stride was measured as 24 feet, 11 inches.[29] His powerful hindquarters allowed him to unleash \\"devastating\\" speed and because he was so well-muscled and had significant cardiac capacity, he could simply out-gallop competitors at nearly any point in a race.[22]\\r\\nHis weight before the Gotham Stakes in April 1973 was 1,155 pounds (524?kg).[30] After completing the grueling Triple Crown, his weight on June 15 had dropped only 24 pounds, to 1,131 pounds (513?kg).[23] Secretariat was known for his appetiteduring his three-year-old campaign, he ate 15 quarts of oats a dayand to keep the muscle from turning to fat, he needed fast workouts that could have won many a stakes race.[31]\\r\\nSeth Hancock of Claiborne Farm once said,\\r\\nYou want to know who Secretariat is in human terms? Just imagine the greatest athlete in the world. The greatest. Now make him six-foot-three, the perfect height. Make him real intelligent and kind. And on top of that, make him the best-lookin' guy ever to come down the pike. He was all those things as a horse.[32]\\r\\nSecretariat raced in Meadow Stables' blue-and-white-checkered colors. He never raced in track bandages, but typically wore a blinker hood, mostly to help him focus, but also because he had a tendency to run in towards the rail during races.[23] In January 1972, he joined trainer Lucien Laurin's winter stable at Hialeah. Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse, likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses. He had the physique of a runner, but at first was awkward and clumsy. He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates, running a quarter-mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers.[33] His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis. Davis was not initially impressed. \\"He was a big fat sucker\\", Davis said. \\"I mean, he was big. He wasn't in a hurry to do nothin'. He took his time. The quality was there, but he didn't show it until he wanted to.\\"[34] Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as \\"having this big red machine under me, and from that very first day I knew he had a power of strength that I have never felt before?...\\"[35]\\r\\nGroom Eddie Sweat was another important member of the Secretariat team, providing most of the daily hands-on care. Sweat once told a reporter, \\"I guess a groom gets closer to a horse than anyone. The owner, the trainer, they maybe see him once a day. But I lived with him, worked with him.\\"[36]\\r\\nLaurin sent Chenery regular updates on Secretariat's progress, saying that the colt was still learning to run, or that he still needed to lose his baby fat.[33][37] Chenery recalled that when Secretariat was in training, Lucien once said: \\"Your big Bold Ruler colt don't show me nothin'. He can't outrun a fat man.\\"[38] But Secretariat made steady progress over the spring. On June 6, he wore blinkers for the first time to keep his attention focused and responded with a half-mile workout in a solid 47?3?5 seconds. On June 24, he ran a \\"bullet\\", the fastest workout of the day, at 6 furlongs in 1:12?4?5 on a sloppy track. Laurin called Chenery at her Colorado home and advised her that Secretariat was ready to race.[39]\\r\\nFor his first start on July 4, 1972 at Aqueduct Racetrack, Secretariat was made the lukewarm favorite at 3ÿ1. At the start, a horse named Quebec cut in front of the field, causing a chain reaction that resulted in Secretariat being bumped hard. According to jockey Paul Feliciano, he would have fallen if he hadn't been so strong. Secretariat recovered, only to run into traffic on the backstretch. In tenth position at the top of the stretch, he closed ground rapidly and finished fourth, beaten by only ?1?1?4 lengths.[32][40] In many of his subsequent races, Secretariat hung back at the start, which Laurin later attributed to the bumping he received in his debut.[41]\\r\\nWith Feliciano again up, Secretariat returned to the track on July 15 as the 6ÿ5 favorite. He broke poorly, but then rushed past the field on the turn to win by six lengths.[42] On July 31 in an allowance race at Saratoga, Feliciano was replaced by Ron Turcotte, the regular jockey for Meadow Stables. Turcotte had ridden the colt in several morning workouts, but had missed his first two starts while recovering from a fall. Secretariat's commanding win as the 2ÿ5 favorite[43] caught the attention of veteran sportswriter, Charles Hatton. He later reported, \\"You carry an ideal around in your head, and boy, I thought, 'This is it.' I never saw perfection before. I absolutely could not fault him in any way. And neither could the rest of them and that was the amazing thing about it. The body and the head and the eye and the general attitude. It was just incredible. I couldn't believe my eyes, frankly.\\"[37]\\r\\nIn August, Secretariat entered the Sanford Stakes, facing off with highly regarded Linda's Chief. Entering the stretch, Secretariat was blocked by the horses in front of him but then made his way through \\"like a hawk scattering a barnyard of chickens\\"[26] on his way to a three-length win. Sportswriter Andrew Beyer covered the race for the Washington Star and later wrote, \\"Never have I watched a lightly raced 2-year-old stamp himself so definitively as a potential great.\\"[44]\\r\\nTen days later in the Hopeful Stakes, Secretariat made a \\"dazzling\\" move, passing eight horses within ?1?4 mile to take the lead then drawing off to win by five lengths.[45] His time of 1:16?1?5 for ?6?1?2 furlongs was only ?3?5 of a second off the track record.[46] Returning to Belmont Park on September 16, he won the Belmont Futurity by a length and a half after starting his move on the turn. He then ran in the Champagne Stakes at Belmont on October 14 as the 7ÿ10 favorite.[42] As had become his custom, he started slowly and then made a big move around the turn, blowing past his rivals to win by two lengths. However, following an inquiry by the racecourse stewards, Secretariat was disqualified and placed second for bearing in and interfering with Stop the Music, who was declared the winner.[47]\\r\\nSecretariat then took the Laurel Futurity on October 28, winning by eight lengths over Stop the Music. His time on a sloppy track was just ?1?5 of a second off the track record.[48] He completed his season in the Garden State Futurity on November 18, dropping back early and making a powerful move around the turn to win by ?3?1?2 lengths at 1ÿ10 odds. Laurin said, \\"In all his races, he has taken the worst of it by coming from behind, usually circling his field. A colt has to be a real runner to do this consistently and get away with it.\\"[49]\\r\\nSecretariat won the Eclipse Award for American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse and, in a rare occurrence, two two-year-olds topped the balloting for 1972 American Horse of the Year honors, with Secretariat edging out the undefeated filly, La Prevoyante. Secretariat received the votes of the Thoroughbred Racing Associations of North America and the Daily Racing Form, while La Prevoyante was chosen by the National Turf Writers Association.[50][51] Only one horse since then, Favorite Trick in 1997, has won that award as a two-year-old.[52]\\r\\nIn January 1973, Christopher Chenery, the founder of Meadow Stables, died and the taxes on his estate forced his daughter Penny to consider selling Secretariat. Together with Seth Hancock of Claiborne Farm, she instead managed to syndicate the horse, selling 32 shares worth $190,000 each for a total of $6.08 million, a world syndication record at the time, surpassing the previous record for Nijinsky who was syndicated for $5.44 million in 1970.[53] Hancock said the sale was easy, citing Secretariat's two-year-old performance, breeding, and appearance. \\"He's, well, he's a hell of a horse.\\" Chenery retained four shares in the horse and would have complete control over his three-year-old racing campaign, but agreed that he would be retired at the end of the year.[41]\\r\\nSecretariat wintered in Florida but did not race until March 17, 1973 in the Bay Shore Stakes at Aqueduct, where he went off as the heavy favorite. As the trainer of one of his opponents put it, \\"The only chance we have is if he falls down.\\"[41] Racing boxed in by horses on each side, Turcotte decided to go through a narrow gap between horses rather than try to circle the field. Secretariat broke free and won easily, but one of the other jockeys claimed that Secretariat had committed a foul going through the hole. The stewards reviewed photos from the race and determined that Secretariat was actually on the receiving end of a bump, so let the result stand.[54] The Bay Shore established that Secretariat had improved over the winter and that he could also handle adversity.[55]\\r\\nIn the Gotham Stakes on April 7, Laurin decided to experiment with Secretariat's running style. With no speed horses entered in the race, Secretariat would be allowed to set his own pace. Accordingly, Turcotte hustled Secretariat from the starting gate and they led easily. Down the stretch though, Champagne Charlie came running and at the eighth pole was almost even. Turcotte tapped Secretariat once on each side with the whip and Secretariat drew away to win by three lengths. He ran the first 3/4 mile in 1:08?3?5 and finished the one-mile race in 1:33?2?5, matching the track record.[30]\\r\\nHis final preparatory race for the Kentucky Derby was the Wood Memorial, where he finished a surprising third to Angle Light and Santa Anita Derby winner Sham. Laurin was crushed, even though he had trained the winner, Angle Light, who set a slow pace and \\"stole\\" the race.[55] Secretariat's loss was later attributed to a large abscess in his mouth, which made him sensitive to the bit.[32] Before and after the race, there was some ill feeling between Laurin and the trainer of Sham, Pancho Martin, fanned by comments in the press. The dispute centered around the use of coupled entries[b] as Martin had entered two horses in addition to Sham, all with the same owner. There was fear that an entry could be used tactically to gang up on another horse. Stung by such insinuations, Martin wound up scratching the two horses that he had originally entered with Sham, and asked Lauren to do the same, but Laurin could not follow suit as Secretariat and Angle Light had different owners.[57]\\r\\nBecause of the Wood Memorial results, Secretariat's chances in the Kentucky Derby became the subject of much speculation in the media.[58] Some questioned his stamina: in part because of his \\"blocky\\" build, more typical of a sprinter, and in part because of Bold Ruler's reputation as a sire of precocious sprinters.[59] Rumors circulated that Secretariat was unsound.[32]\\r\\nThe 1973 Kentucky Derby on May 5 attracted a crowd of 134,476 to Churchill Downs, then the largest crowd in North American racing history.[60] The bettors made the entry of Secretariat and Angle Light the 3ÿ2 favorite, with Sham the second choice at 5ÿ2. The start was marred when Twice a Prince reared in his stall, hitting Our Native, positioned next to him, and causing Sham to bang his head against the gate, loosening two teeth. Sham then broke poorly and cut himself, also bumping into Navajo. Secretariat avoided problems by breaking last from post position 10, then cut over to the rail. Early leader Shecky Greene set a reasonable pace, then gave way to Sham around the far turn. Secretariat came charging as they entered the stretch and battled with Sham down the stretch, finally pulling away to win by ?2?1?2 lengths. Our Native finished eight lengths further back in third.[61][62]\\r\\nOn his way to a still-standing track record of 1:59?2?5,[63] Secretariat ran each quarter-mile segment faster than the one before it. The successive quarter-mile times were?:25?1?5,?:24,?:23?4?5,?:23?2?5, and?:23.[32] This means he was still accelerating as of the final quarter-mile of the race.[21] No other horse had won the Derby in less than 2 minutes before, and it would not be accomplished again until Monarchos ran the race in 1:59.97 in 2001.[64]\\r\\nSportswriter Mike Sullivan later said:\\r\\nI was at Secretariat's Derby, in '73?... That was?... just beauty, you know? He started in last place, which he tended to do. I was covering the second-place horse, which wound up being Sham. It looked like Sham's race going into the last turn, I think. The thing you have to understand is that Sham was fast, a beautiful horse. He would have had the Triple Crown in another year. And it just didn't seem like there could be anything faster than that. Everybody was watching him. It was over, more or less. And all of a sudden there was this, like, just a disruption in the corner of your eye, in your peripheral vision. And then before you could make out what it was, here Secretariat came. And then Secretariat had passed him. No one had ever seen anything run like that ÿ a lot of the old guys said the same thing. It was like he was some other animal out there.[65]\\r\\nIn the 1973 Preakness Stakes on May 19, Secretariat broke last, but then made a huge, last-to-first move on the first turn. Raymond Woolfe, a photographer for the Daily Racing Form, captured Secretariat launching the move with a leaping stride in the air. This was later used as the basis for the statue by John Skeaping that stands in the Belmont Park paddock.[66] Turcotte later said that he was proudest of this win because of the split-second decision he made going into the turn: \\"I let my horse drop back, when I went to drop in, they started backing up into me. I said, 'I don't want to get trapped here.' So I just breezed by them.\\"[67] Secretariat completed the second quarter mile of the race in under 22 seconds.[31] After reaching the lead with ?5?1?2 furlongs to go, Secretariat was never challenged, and won by ?2?1?2 lengths, with Sham again finishing second and Our Native in third, a further eight lengths back. It was the first time in history that the top three finishers in the Derby and Preakness were the same; the distance between each of the horses was also the same.[68]\\r\\nThe time of the race was disputed. The infield teletimer displayed a time of 1:55 but it had malfunctioned because of damage caused by people crossing the track to reach the infield. The Pimlico Race Course clocker E.T. McLean Jr. announced a hand time of 1:54?2?5, but two Daily Racing Form clockers claimed the time was 1:53?2?5, which would have broken the track record of 1:54 set by Ca?onero II. Tapes of Secretariat and Ca?onero II were played side by side by CBS, and Secretariat got to the finish line first on tape, though this was not a reliable method of timing a horse race at the time. The Maryland Jockey Club, which managed the Pimlico racetrack and is responsible for maintaining Preakness records, discarded both the electronic and Daily Racing Form times and recognized the clocker's 1:54?2?5 as the official time; however, the Daily Racing Form, for the first time in history, printed its own clocking of 1:53?2?5 underneath the official time in the chart of the race.[66][68][69][70]\\r\\nOn June 19, 2012, a special meeting of the Maryland Racing Commission was convened at Laurel Park at the request of Penny Chenery, who hired companies to conduct a forensic review of the videotapes of the race. After over two hours of testimony, the commission unanimously voted to change the time of Secretariat's win from 1:54?2?5 to 1:53, establishing a new stakes record. The Daily Racing Form announced that it would honor the commission's ruling with regard to the running time.[69] With the revised time, Sham also would have broken the old stakes record.[66]\\r\\nAs Secretariat prepared for the Belmont Stakes, he appeared on the covers of three national magazines: Time, Newsweek, and Sports Illustrated. He had become a national celebrity.[45] William Nack wrote: \\"Secretariat suddenly transcended horse racing and became a cultural phenomenon, a sort of undeclared national holiday from the tortures of Watergate and the Vietnam War.\\"[32] Chenery needed a secretary to handle all the fan mail and hired the William Morris Agency to manage public engagements.[16] Secretariat responded to his fame by learning to pose for the camera.[71][72]\\r\\nOnly four horses ran against Secretariat for the June 9 Belmont Stakes, including Sham and three other horses thought to have little chance by the bettors: Twice A Prince, My Gallant, and Private Smiles. With so few horses in the race, and Secretariat expected to win, no \\"show\\" bets were taken. Secretariat was sent off as a 1ÿ10 favorite[73] before a crowd of 69,138, then the second largest attendance in Belmont history.[74] The race was televised by CBS and was watched by over 15 million households, an audience share of 52%.[75]\\r\\nOn race day, the track was fast, and the weather was warm and sunny.[73] Secretariat broke well on the rail and Sham rushed up beside him. The two ran the first quarter in a quick?:23?3?5 and the next quarter in a swift?:22?3?5, completing the fastest opening half mile in the history of the race and opening ten lengths on the rest of the field. After the six-furlong mark, Sham began to tire, ultimately finishing last. Secretariat continued the fast pace and opened up a larger and larger margin on the field. His time for the mile was 1:34?1?5, over a second faster than the next fastest Belmont mile fraction in history, set by his sire Bold Ruler, who had eventually tired and finished third. Secretariat, however, did not falter. Turcotte said, \\"This horse really paced himself. He is smart: I think he knew he was going ?1?1?2 miles, I never pushed him.\\"[77] In the stretch, Secretariat opened a lead of almost ?1?16 of a mile on the rest of the field. At the finish, he won by 31 lengths, breaking the margin-of-victory record set by Triple Crown winner Count Fleet in 1943 of 25 lengths.[76] CBS Television announcer Chic Anderson described the horse's pace in a famous commentary:\\r\\nSecretariat is widening now! He is moving like a tremendous machine![78][76]\\r\\nThe time for the race was not only a record, it was the fastest ?1?1?2 miles on dirt in history, 2:24 flat, breaking the stakes record by more than two seconds.[76] Secretariat's record still stands as an American record on the dirt.[79] If the Beyer Speed Figure calculation had been developed during that time, Andrew Beyer calculated that Secretariat would have earned a figure of 139, the highest he has ever assigned.[44][80]\\r\\nA large crowd had started gathering around the paddock hours before the Belmont, many missing the races run earlier in the day for a chance to see the horses up close. Secretariat and Chenery were greeted with an enthusiasm that Chenery responded to with a wave or smile;[81] Secretariat was imperturbable. A large cheer went up at the break, but as the race went on, the two most commonly reported reactions were disbelief and fear that Secretariat had gone too fast.[32][81][82][83] When it was clear that Secretariat would win, the sound reached a crescendo that reportedly made the grandstand shake.[71] Blood-Horse magazine editor Kent Hollingsworth described the impact: \\"Two twenty-four flat! I don't believe it. Impossible. But I saw it. I can't breathe. He won by a sixteenth of a mile! I saw it. I have to believe it.\\"[81]\\r\\nThe race is widely considered the greatest performance of the twentieth century by a North American racehorse.[82][84][85] Secretariat became the ninth Triple Crown winner in history, and the first since Citation in 1948, a gap of 25 years.[86] Bettors holding 5,427 winning parimutuel tickets on Secretariat never redeemed them, presumably keeping them as souvenirs (and because the tickets would have paid only $2.20 on a $2 bet).[87]\\r\\nThree weeks after his win at Belmont, Secretariat was shipped to Arlington Park for the Arlington Invitational. Laurin explained: \\"Even before the Belmont, you remember, I said I really didn't know how I could give this horse a rest. He's so strong and full of energy. Well, this is only a week and a half after the Belmont, and believe me when I tell you, if I don't run this horse he's going to hurt himself in his stall. So we decided it would be nice to race him in Chicago to let the people in the Midwest have a chance to see him run.\\" The race was run at ?1?1?8 miles with a purse of $125,000. The challengers were grouped as a single betting entry at 6ÿ1: Secretariat was 1ÿ20 (the legal minimum) and created a minus pool of $17,941.[88]\\r\\nMayor Richard Daley of Chicago declared that the Saturday of the race was Secretariat Day. A crowd of 41,223 (the largest at Arlington in three decades) greeted his arrival on the track with sustained applause. Secretariat broke poorly but soon went to the lead, setting slow early fractions. He gathered momentum on the final turn and eventually won by nine lengths in 1:47 flat, just ?1?5 off the track record set by Damascus.[88] George Plimpton commented, \\"With a better start, a horse to press him and less bow to his turns, Secretariat might have posted a time that would have stood a century.\\"[89]\\r\\nSecretariat next went to Saratoga, popularly nicknamed \\"the graveyard of champions\\", in preparation for the Whitney Stakes on August 4, where he would face older horses the first time. On July 27, he put in a stunning workout of 1:34 for a mile on a sloppy track, a time that would have broken Saratoga's track record. On race day though, he was beaten by the Allen Jerkens-trained Onion, a four-year-old gelding who had set a track record at ?6?1?2 furlongs in his previous start. The track condition for the Whitney was labelled fast but was running slow, especially along the inside rail. Secretariat broke poorly and Onion led from the start, setting a slow pace running well off the rail. Down the backstretch, Turcotte chose to make his move along the rail rather than sweeping wide. Secretariat responded more sluggishly than usual and Turcotte went to the whip. Secretariat closed to within a head on the final turn before Onion pulled ahead in the straight to win by a length.[90] A record crowd of more than 30,000 witnessed what was described as an \\"astonishing\\" upset.[91]\\r\\nDespite Jerkens's reputation as the \\"Giant Killer,\\" Secretariat's stunning loss can possibly be attributed to a viral infection, which caused a low-grade fever and diarrhea. \\"I was learning then that anything could happen in horse racing\\", said Chenery. \\"We knew he had a low-grade infection. But we decided he was strong enough to win anyway, and we were wrong.\\"[92]\\r\\nSecretariat lost his appetite and acted sluggishly for several days.[93] Charles Hatton wrote: \\"He seemed distressingly ill walking off, and he missed the Travers. Returned to Belmont to point for the $250,000 Marlboro, the sport's pin-up horse looked bloody awful, rather like one of those sick paintings which betoken an inner theatre of the macabre. It required supernatural recuperative powers to recover as he did. He was subjected to four severe preps in two weeks. Astonishingly, he gained weight and blossomed with every trial.\\"[23]\\r\\nOn September 15, Secretariat returned to Belmont Park in the inaugural Marlboro Cup, which was originally intended to be a match race with stablemate Riva Ridge, the 1972 Derby and Belmont Stakes winner. After Secretariat's loss in the Whitney, the field was expanded to invite top horses from across the country.[94] Entries included 1972 turf champion and top California stakes winner Cougar II, Canadian champion Kennedy Road, 1972 American champion three-year-old colt Key to the Mint, Travers winner Annihilate 'Em (the only other three-year-old in the race), and Onion. Riva Ridge was assigned top weight of 127 pounds (one pound over the weight-for-age scale), Key to the Mint and Cougar II were at 126 pounds, scale weight, while Secretariat was at 124, three pounds over scale for his age. The field included five champions, and the seven starters had won 63 stakes races between them.[95]\\r\\nIt rained the night before, but the track dried out by race time. Secretariat stalked a fast pace in fifth, while Riva Ridge rated just behind Onion and Kennedy Road. Around the turn, Secretariat raced wide and started to make up ground. Coming into the stretch, Secretariat overtook Riva Ridge, while the other early leaders dropped back. Secretariat drew away to win, completing ?1?1?8 miles in 1:45??2?5, then a world record on the dirt for the distance. Riva Ridge ran second with Cougar II in third and Onion in fourth. Turcotte said, \\"Today he was the old Secretariat and he did it on his own.\\"[96] The purse for the Marlboro Cup was $250,000, then the highest prize money offered: the win made Secretariat the 13th Thoroughbred millionaire in history.[97][98]\\r\\nAfter the Marlboro Cup, the original plan was to enter Riva Ridge in the ?1?1?2 mile Woodward Stakes, just two weeks later, while Secretariat put in some slow workouts on the turf in preparation for the Man o' War Stakes in October. It rained before the Woodward and the track was sloppy, which Riva Ridge could not handle, so Secretariat was entered in his place. Secretariat led into the straight but was overtaken by the Allen Jerkens-trained four-year-old Prove Out, who pulled clear to win by ?4?1?2 lengths. Prove Out ran the race of his life that day: his time was the second-fastest mile-and-a-half on the dirt in Belmont history despite the sloppy conditions.[93][99] Prove Out went on to beat Riva Ridge in that year's Jockey Club Gold Cup.[100]\\r\\nOn October 8, just nine days after the Woodward, Secretariat was moved to turf for the Man O' War Stakes at a distance of ?1?1?2 miles. He faced Tentam, who had set a world record for ?1?1?8 miles on the turf earlier that summer, and five others. Secretariat went to the lead early, followed by Tentam, who gradually closed the gap down the backstretch. Tentam got to within a half-length before Secretariat responded, pulling away by three lengths. Tentam made another run around the far turn, but Secretariat again drew away, eventually winning by five lengths over Tentam, with Big Spruce seven and a half lengths further back in third. Secretariat set a course record time of 2:24?4?5. After the race, Ron Turcotte explained that \\"when Tentam came up to him in the backstretch I just chirped to him and he pulled away\\".[101]\\r\\nThe syndication deal for Secretariat precluded the horse racing past age three. Accordingly, Secretariat's last race was against older horses in the Canadian International Stakes over one and five-eighths miles on the turf at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on October 28, 1973. The race was chosen in part because of long-time ties between E.P. Taylor and the Chenery family,[102] and partly to honor Secretariat's Canadian connections, Laurin and Turcotte.[103] Unfortunately, Turcotte missed the race with a five-day suspension: Eddie Maple got the mount.[104]\\r\\nThe day of the race was cold, windy and wet, but the Marshall turf course was firm. Despite the weather, some 35,000 people turned out to greet Secretariat in a \\"virtual hysteria\\" that Secretariat seemed not to notice. His biggest opponents were Kennedy Road, who he had already beaten in the Marlboro Cup, and Big Spruce, who had finished third in the Man o' War. Kennedy Road went to the early lead, while Secretariat moved to second after breaking from an outside post. On the backstretch, Secretariat made his move and forged to the lead. \\"Snorting steam in the raw twilight\\",[105] he rounded the far turn with a 12-length lead before gearing down in the final furlong, ultimately winning by ?6?1?2 lengths.[106] Once again, many winning tickets went uncashed by souvenir hunters.[103]\\r\\nAfter the race, Secretariat was brought to Aqueduct Racetrack where he was paraded with Turcotte dressed in the Meadow silks before a crowd of 32,990 in his final public appearance. \\"It's a sad day, and yet it's a great day\\", said Laurin. \\"I certainly wish he could run as a 4-year-old. He's a great horse and he loves to run.\\"[107]\\r\\nAltogether, Secretariat won 16 of his 21 career races, with three seconds and one third, and total earnings of $1,316,808.[1]\\r\\nFor 1973, Secretariat was again named Horse of the Year, and won Eclipse Awards as the American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse and the American Champion Male Turf Horse.[108]\\r\\nWhen Secretariat first retired to Claiborne Farm, his sperm showed some signs of immaturity,[23] so he was bred to three non-Thoroughbred mares in December 1973 to test his fertility. One of these, an Appaloosa named Leola, produced Secretariat's first foal in November 1974. Named First Secretary, the foal was a chestnut like his sire, but spotted like his dam.[109]\\r\\nSecretariat's first official foal crop, arriving in 1975, consisted of 28 foals, the best of which was Dactylographer, who won the William Hill Futurity in October 1977.[110] The first crop also included Canadian Bound, who at the 1976 Keeneland July sale was the first yearling to break the $1 million barrier, selling for $1.5 million. Canadian Bound, however, was a complete failure in racing,[111] and for several years, the value of Secretariat's offspring declined considerably, especially given the rising popularity of Northern Dancer's offspring in the sales ring.[112]\\r\\nSecretariat eventually sired a number of major stakes winners, including:[21]\\r\\nUltimately, Secretariat officially sired 663 named foals, including 341 winners (51.4%) and 54 stakes winners (8.1%) .[119] There has been some criticism of Secretariat as a stallion, mainly because he did not produce male offspring of his own ability and did not leave a leading sire son behind, but his legacy is assured though the quality of his daughters, several of whom were excellent racers and even more of whom were excellent producers. In 1992, Secretariat was the leading broodmare sire in North America. Overall, Secretariat's daughters produced 24 Grade/Group 1 winners.[110] As a broodmare sire, Secretariat's most notable progeny were:[21][110]\\r\\nThrough Weekend Surprise and Terlingua alone, Secretariat appears in the pedigree of numerous champions. Weekend Surprises's son A.P. Indy was the leading sire in North America in 2003 and 2006, and is the sire of 2003 Horse of the Year Mineshaft and 2007 Belmont Stakes winner Rags to Riches. He has also established a successful sire-line that leads to Kentucky Derby winners Orb and California Chrome.[127] A.P. Indy's leading sire-line descendant is Tapit, who led the sire list in 2014ÿ2015 and is the sire of Belmont Stakes winners Tonalist and Creator.[128] Terlingua's son Storm Cat is also a two time leading sire, whose offspring include Giant's Causeway, three-time leading sire in North America.[129] Storm Cat also sired Yankee Gentleman, who is the broodmare sire of 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah.[130]\\r\\nInbreeding to Secretariat has also proven successful, as exemplified by numerous graded stakes winners, including two-time Horse of the Year Wise Dan, as well as sprint champion Speightstown.[131]\\r\\nSecretariat's paddock at Claiborne Farm bordered three other stallions: Drone, Sir Ivor, and Hall of Fame inductee Spectacular Bid. Secretariat did not pay much attention to Drone or Sir Ivor, but he and Spectacular Bid became friendly and occasionally raced each other along the fence line between their paddocks.[132][133]\\r\\nIn the fall of 1989, Secretariat became afflicted with laminitisa painful and debilitating hoof condition. When his condition failed to improve after a month of treatment, he was euthanized on October 4 at the age of 19.[32] Secretariat was buried at Claiborne Farm,[134] given the rare honor of being buried whole (usually only the head, heart, and hooves of a winning race horse are buried).[38]\\r\\nAt the time of Secretariat's death, the veterinarian who performed the necropsy, Dr. Thomas Swerczek, head pathologist at the University of Kentucky, did not weigh Secretariat's heart, but stated, \\"We just stood there in stunned silence. We couldn't believe it. The heart was perfect. There were no problems with it. It was just this huge engine.\\"[32] Later, Swerczek also performed a necropsy on Sham, who died in 1993. Swerczek did weigh Sham's heart, and it was 18 pounds (8.2?kg). Based on Sham's measurement, and having necropsied both horses, he estimated Secretariat's heart probably weighed 22 pounds (10.0?kg), or about 2.5 times that of the average horse (8.5 pounds (3.9?kg)).[135]\\r\\nAn extremely large heart is a trait that occasionally occurs in Thoroughbreds, hypothesized to be linked to a genetic condition, called the \\"x-factor\\", passed down in specific inheritance patterns.[135][136][137] The x-factor can be traced to the historic racehorse Eclipse, who was necropsied after his death in 1789. Because Eclipse's heart appeared to be much larger than other horses, it was weighed, and found to be 14 pounds (6.4?kg), almost twice the normal weight. Eclipse is believed to have passed the trait on via his daughters, and pedigree research verified that Secretariat traces in his dam line to a daughter of Eclipse. Secretariat's success as a broodmare sire has been linked by some to this large heart theory.[135] However, it has not been proven whether the x-factor exists, let alone increases athletic ability.[138][139]\\r\\nSecretariat was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1974, the year following his Triple Crown victory.[140] Also in 1974, Paul Mellon commissioned a bronze statue, sometimes known as Secretariat in Full Stride, from John Skeaping. The life-size statue remained in the center of the walking ring at Belmont Park until 1988 when it was replaced by a replica.[141] The original is now located at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.[142] The Kentucky Horse Park has two other life-sized statues of Secretariat. The first, created by Jim Reno in 1992, shows Secretariat as an older sire, while the second, completed by Edwin Bogucki in 2004, shows him being led into the winner's circle after the Kentucky Derby.[143] In 2015, a new statue of Secretariat and Ron Turcotte crossing the finish line at the Belmont Stakes was unveiled in Grand Falls, New Brunswick, Turcotte's hometown.[144]\\r\\nIn 1994, Sports Illustrated ranked Secretariat #17 in their list of the 40 greatest sports figures of the past 40 years.[31] In 1999, ESPN listed him 35th of the 100 greatest North American athletes of the 20th century, the highest of three non-humans on the list (the other two were also racehorses: Man o' War at 84th and Citation at 97th).[145] Secretariat ranked second behind Man o' War in The Blood-Horse's List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century.[2][146] He was also ranked second behind Man o' War by both a six-member panel of experts assembled by the Associated Press,[147] and a Sports Illustrated panel of seven experts.[148]\\r\\nOn October 16, 1999 in a ceremony conducted in the winner's circle at Keeneland Race Course in Lexington, the U.S. Postal Service honored Secretariat with a 33-cent postage stamp bearing his image.[149][150] In 2005, Secretariat was featured in ESPN Classic's show \\"Who's No. 1?\\" in the episode \\"Greatest Sports Performances\\". He was the only nonhuman on the list, with his run at Belmont ranking second behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game.[151] On May 2, 2007, Secretariat was inducted into the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame, marking the first time an animal received this honor.[152] In 2013, Secretariat was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in honor of his victory in the Canadian International 40 years earlier.[102] Secretariat was also the focus of a 2013 segment of 60 Minutes Sports.[84] In March 2016, Secretariat's Triple Crown victory was rated #13 in the Sports Illustrated listing of the 100 Greatest Moments in Sports History.[153]\\r\\nDue to Secretariat's enduring popularity, Chenery remained a prominent figure in racing and a powerful advocate for Thoroughbred aftercare and veterinary research until her death in 2017.[154][155] In 2004, the Maker's Mark Secretariat Center, dedicated to reschooling former racehorses and matching them to new homes, opened at the Kentucky Horse Park.[156] In 2010, Chenery developed the Secretariat Vox Populi (\\"voice of the people\\") Award, which is voted for by racing fans. It is intended to acknowledge \\"the horse whose popularity and racing excellence best resounded with the American public and gained recognition for Thoroughbred racing.\\"[157] The consideration of the racing fan's engagement is what distinguishes the Vox Populi award from others. The first honoree in 2010 was Zenyatta, that year's Horse of the Year, while the second award went to Rapid Redux, a former claimer who went on to win 22 consecutive races at smaller racetracks.[158] Paynter received the 2012 award for his battle with laminitis, the same condition that led to Secretariat's death. \\"Paynter's popularity stems from his ability to battle and exceed expectations, making him the perfect choice as the recipient of this year's Vox Populi Award\\", said Chenery. \\"After seeing firsthand the devastating effects of this disease, I am even more convinced that the industry must continue to diligently fight laminitis. The progress we have made to date clearly benefited Paynter  a beautiful colt with a tremendous spirit.\\"[157]\\r\\nThe Secretariat Stakes was created in 1974 to honor his appearance at Arlington Park in 1973.[159] The Meadow, the farm at which he was born, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is now known as The Meadow Historic District.[160]\\r\\nSecretariat, a Disney live-action film about the racing career of Secretariat, written by Mike Rich and directed by Randall Wallace, was released on October 8, 2010.[161]\\r\\nSecretariat's earnings in 1973 were, at the time, a single-season record.[23]\\r\\nSecretariat was by Bold Ruler, who led the North America sire list eight times, more than any other stallion in the 20th century. He also led the juvenile (two-year-old) sire list a record six times. Before Secretariat's Triple Crown run, Bold Ruler was often categorized as a sire of precocious juveniles that lacked stamina or did not train on past age two.[169] However, even before Secretariat, Bold Ruler actually had sired 11 stakes winners of races at 10 furlongs or more.[170] Ultimately, seven of the ten Kentucky Derby winners in the 1970s traced directly to Bold Ruler in their tail male lines, including Secretariat and fellow Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew.[171]\\r\\nSecretariat's dam was Somethingroyal, the 1973 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year. Although Somethingroyal was unplaced in her only start, she had an excellent pedigree. Her sire Princequillo was the leading broodmare sire from 1966 to 1970 and was noted as a source of stamina and soundness.[172] Her dam Imperatrice was a stakes winner who was purchased by Christopher Chenery at a dispersal sale in 1947 for $30,000. Imperatrice produced several stakes winners and stakes producers for the Meadow. Prior to foaling Secretariat at age 18, Somethingroyal had already produced Sir Gaylord, a stakes winner who became an important sire, whose offspring included Epsom Derby winner Sir Ivor.

Active Duty military stationed in Indiana can apply for lifetime permits through their local city or county police department.\\r\\nIndiana law stands mute vis--vis long gun carry. There are some Department of Natural Resources (DNR) rules, but these only apply on DNR properties or to hunters. Generally speaking, possession of long guns is legal whether the gun is either on one's person or in one's motor vehicle, loaded or not, concealed or not. There are additional rules regarding firearms possession on ATVs and snowmobiles.\\r\\nIt is illegal to carry a concealed weapon, even sporting arms, on school property (K-12 and day care) or on a school bus,[8] Lawful gun owners may have guns in their vehicles on school property provided the gun is stored out of plain sight in the person's locked motor vehicle[9] or that the driver is only transporting someone to, or from, a school event. It is also illegal to carry on a commercial airplane or in the controlled section of an airport,[10] on a riverboat gambling cruise, at the Indiana State Fair, courthouses and the Indiana Statehouse and Government Center. Carrying on Army Corps of Engineers property which include Brookville Lake, Cagles Mill Lake, Cecil M. Harden Lake, J.

An Illinois Firearms Owners Identification (FOID) card allows Illinois residents to purchase and possess firearms and ammunition. The FOID is not a permit to carry a handgun, therefore it is not honored as such by Indiana,[15] but the Illinois license to carry a concealed firearm, first issued in February 2014, is honored like that of any other state.\\r\\nThe following states have established arrangements where they recognize or honor permits or licenses issued by the State of Indiana: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin, Wyoming[16]\\r\\nIn January 2013, the Indiana State Police Firearms Section began publishing quarterly reports that show the number of active handgun licenses held by Indiana residents. As of December 31, 2015, there were 661,334 active licenses to carry firearms issued by Indiana, with 23.8% being issued to females. In 2015, 5.4% of all applicants were rejected for various reasons, 15.5% of rejected applicants being female. [17]\\r\\nBoth Indiana and Federal laws restrict purchase and possession under certain circumstances. Federal law prohibits possession of firearms for life by those convicted of felonies and for those convicted of misdemeanors involving domestic violence. Indiana law prohibits as follows:\\r\\nWhile Indiana law mirrors federal law for the most part, it does not ban those with non-violent felonies from possession of firearms. Therefore, a person with a non-violent felony in Indiana would be allowed to possess a firearm under Indiana law, but because federal law prohibits possession in this instance, that person would be unable to purchase a firearm since purchasing a firearm is subject to federal law and a NICS background check. [18]\\r\\nBecause firearm rights are governed by state and federal law, whether someone can restore those rights can be a tricky question even for an attorney to answer. In some circumstances a person might be able to restore their Indiana rights while not fully restoring their federal rights.\\r\\nFor those barred from possession because of a conviction for domestic battery, Indiana Code  35-47-4-7 allows one to petition the court for restoration of the right after 5 years from the date of conviction.\\r\\nRestoration of rights for those convicted of felonies is usually barred by federal law. This arises because federal law does not recognize expungements as restoring firearm rights if the expungement does not fully satisfy federal law by fully sealing the conviction so that it cannot be used in subsequent proceedings. Therefore, while an Indiana expungement restores civil rights (except for domestic battery, which requires a separate petition), it does not restore ones federal rights. The only exception is for non-violent Class D felony convictions. Because Indiana law allows those with non-violent Class D felony convictions to petition the court to reduce the felony to a Class A misdemeanor, unless a person was barred by other convictions, a successful reduction will restore a persons rights under federal and state law.

(taxis), meaning 'arrangement', and -?ϫ (-nomia), meaning 'method') is the science of defining and naming groups of biological organisms on the basis of shared characteristics. Organisms are grouped together into taxa (singular: taxon) and these groups are given a taxonomic rank; groups of a given rank can be aggregated to form a super group of higher rank, thus creating a taxonomic hierarchy. The principal ranks in modern use are kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species. The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus is regarded as the father of taxonomy, as he developed a system known as Linnaean taxonomy for categorization of organisms and binomial nomenclature for naming organisms.\\r\\nWith the advent of such fields of study as phylogenetics, cladistics, and systematics, the Linnaean system has progressed to a system of modern biological classification based on the evolutionary relationships between organisms, both living and extinct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact definition of taxonomy varies from source to source, but the core of the discipline remains: the conception, naming, and classification of groups of organisms.[1] As points of reference, recent definitions of taxonomy are presented below:\\r\\nThe varied definitions either place taxonomy as a sub-area of systematics (definition 2), invert that relationship (definition 6), or appear to consider the two terms synonymous. There is some disagreement as to whether biological nomenclature is considered a part of taxonomy (definitions 1 and 2), or a part of systematics outside taxonomy.[8] For example, definition 6 is paired with the following definition of systematics that places nomenclature outside taxonomy:[6]\\r\\nA whole set of terms including taxonomy, systematic biology, systematics, biosystematics, scientific classification, biological classification, and phylogenetics have at times had overlapping meanings ÿ sometimes the same, sometimes slightly different, but always related and intersecting.[1][9] The broadest meaning of \\"taxonomy\\" is used here. The term itself was introduced in 1813 by de Candolle, in his Thorie lmentaire de la botanique.[10]\\r\\nThe term \\"alpha taxonomy\\" is primarily used today to refer to the discipline of finding, describing, and naming taxa, particularly species.[11] In earlier literature, the term had a different meaning, referring to morphological taxonomy, and the products of research through the end of the 19th century.[12]\\r\\nWilliam Bertram Turrill introduced the term \\"alpha taxonomy\\" in a series of papers published in 1935 and 1937 in which he discussed the philosophy and possible future directions of the discipline of taxonomy.[13]\\r\\n there is an increasing desire amongst taxonomists to consider their problems from wider viewpoints, to investigate the possibilities of closer co-operation with their cytological, ecological and genetical colleagues and to acknowledge that some revision or expansion, perhaps of a drastic nature, of their aims and methods, may be desirable  Turrill (1935) has suggested that while accepting the older invaluable taxonomy, based on structure, and conveniently designated \\"alpha\\", it is possible to glimpse a far-distant taxonomy built upon as wide a basis of morphological and physiological facts as possible, and one in which \\"place is found for all observational and experimental data relating, even if indirectly, to the constitution, subdivision, origin, and behaviour of species and other taxonomic groups\\". Ideals can, it may be said, never be completely realized. They have, however, a great value of acting as permanent stimulants, and if we have some, even vague, ideal of an \\"omega\\" taxonomy we may progress a little way down the Greek alphabet. Some of us please ourselves by thinking we are now groping in a \\"beta\\" taxonomy.[13]\\r\\nTurrill thus explicitly excludes from alpha taxonomy various areas of study that he includes within taxonomy as a whole, such as ecology, physiology, genetics, and cytology. He further excludes phylogenetic reconstruction from alpha taxonomy (pp. 365ÿ366).\\r\\nLater authors have used the term in a different sense, to mean the delimitation of species (not subspecies or taxa of other ranks), using whatever investigative techniques are available, and including sophisticated computational or laboratory techniques.[14][11] Thus, Ernst Mayr in 1968 defined beta taxonomy as the classification of ranks higher than species.[15]\\r\\nAn understanding of the biological meaning of variation and of the evolutionary origin of groups of related species is even more important for the second stage of taxonomic activity, the sorting of species into groups of relatives (\\"taxa\\") and their arrangement in a hierarchy of higher categories. This activity is what the term classification denotes; it is also referred to as beta taxonomy.\\r\\nHow species should be defined in a particular group of organisms gives rise to practical and theoretical problems that are referred to as the species problem. The scientific work of deciding how to define species has been called microtaxonomy.[16][17][11] By extension, macrotaxonomy is the study of groups at higher taxonomic ranks, from subgenus and above only, than species.[11]\\r\\nWhile some descriptions of taxonomic history attempt to date taxonomy to ancient civilizations, a truly scientific attempt to classify organisms did not occur until the 18th century. Earlier works were primarily descriptive and focused on plants that were useful in agriculture or medicine. There are a number of stages in this scientific thinking. Early taxonomy was based on arbitrary criteria, the so-called \\"artificial systems\\", including Linnaeus's system of sexual classification. Later came systems based on a more complete consideration of the characteristics of taxa, referred to as \\"natural systems\\", such as those of de Jussieu (1789), de Candolle (1813) and Bentham and Hooker (1862ÿ1863). These were pre-evolutionary in thinking. The publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859) led to new ways of thinking about classification based on evolutionary relationships. This was the concept of phyletic systems, from 1883 onwards. This approach was typified by those of Eichler (1883) and Engler (1886ÿ1892). The advent of molecular genetics and statistical methodology allowed the creation of the modern era of \\"phylogenetic systems\\" based on cladistics, rather than morphology alone.[18][19][20]\\r\\nNaming and classifying our surroundings has probably been taking place as long as mankind has been able to communicate. It would always have been important to know the names of poisonous and edible plants and animals in order to communicate this information to other members of the family or group. Medicinal plant illustrations show up in Egyptian wall paintings from c. 1500 BC, indicating that the uses of different species were understood and that a basic taxonomy was in place.[21]\\r\\nIn Canto 3, chapter 10 of Bhagavata Purana 6 types of trees are recognised, by name:[22]\\r\\nOrganisms were first classified by Aristotle (Greece, 384ÿ322 BC) during his stay on the Island of Lesbos.[23][24][25] He classified beings by their parts, or in modern terms attributes, such as having live birth, having four legs, laying eggs, having blood, or being warm-bodied.[26] He divided all living things into two groups: plants and animals.[24] Some of his groups of animals, such as Anhaima (animals without blood, translated as invertebrates) and Enhaima (animals with blood, roughly the vertebrates), as well as groups like the sharks and cetaceans, are still commonly used today.[27] His student Theophrastus (Greece, 370ÿ285 BC) carried on this tradition, mentioning some 500 plants and their uses in his Historia Plantarum. Again, several plant groups currently still recognized can be traced back to Theophrastus, such as Cornus, Crocus, and Narcissus.[24]\\r\\nTaxonomy in the Middle Ages was largely based on the Aristotelian system,[26] with additions concerning the philosophical and existential order of creatures. This included concepts such as the Great chain of being in the Western scholastic tradition,[26] again deriving ultimately from Aristotle. Aristotelian system did not classify plants or fungi, due to the lack of microscope at the time,[25] as his ideas were based on arranging the complete world in a single continuum, as per the scala naturae (the Natural Ladder).[24] This, as well, was taken into consideration in the Great chain of being.[24] Advances were made by scholars such as Procopius, Timotheos of Gaza, Demetrios Pepagomenos, and Thomas Aquinas. Medieval thinkers used abstract philosophical and logical categorizations more suited to abstract philosophy than to pragmatic taxonomy.[24]\\r\\nDuring the Renaissance, the Age of Reason, and the Enlightenment, categorizing organisms became more prevalent,[24] and taxonomic works became ambitious enough to replace the ancient texts. This is sometimes credited to the development of sophisticated optical lenses, which allowed the morphology of organisms to be studied in much greater detail. One of the earliest authors to take advantage of this leap in technology was the Italian physician Andrea Cesalpino (1519ÿ1603), who has been called \\"the first taxonomist\\".[28] His magnum opus De Plantis came out in 1583, and described more than 1500 plant species.[29][30] Two large plant families that he first recognized are still in use today: the Asteraceae and Brassicaceae.[31] Then in the 17th century John Ray (England, 1627ÿ1705) wrote many important taxonomic works.[25] Arguably his greatest accomplishment was Methodus Plantarum Nova (1682),[32] in which he published details of over 18,000 plant species. At the time, his classifications were perhaps the most complex yet produced by any taxonomist, as he based his taxa on many combined characters. The next major taxonomic works were produced by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (France, 1656ÿ1708).[33] His work from 1700, Institutiones Rei Herbariae, included more than 9000 species in 698 genera, which directly influenced Linnaeus, as it was the text he used as a young student.[21]\\r\\nThe Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707ÿ1778)[26] ushered in a new era of taxonomy. With his major works Systema Naturae 1st Edition in 1735,[34] Species Plantarum in 1753,[35] and Systema Naturae 10th Edition,[36] he revolutionized modern taxonomy. His works implemented a standardized binomial naming system for animal and plant species,[37] which proved to be an elegant solution to a chaotic and disorganized taxonomic literature. He not only introduced the standard of class, order, genus, and?species, but also made it possible to identify plants and animals from his book, by using the smaller parts of the flower.[37] Thus the Linnaean system was born, and is still used in essentially the same way today as it was in the 18th century.[37] Currently, plant and animal taxonomists regard Linnaeus' work as the \\"starting point\\" for valid names (at 1753 and 1758 respectively).[38] Names published before these dates are referred to as \\"pre-Linnaean\\", and not considered valid (with the exception of spiders published in Svenska Spindlar[39]). Even taxonomic names published by Linnaeus himself before these dates are considered pre-Linnaean.[21]\\r\\nWhereas Linnaeus classified for ease of identification, the idea of the Linnaean taxonomy as translating into a sort of dendrogram of the Animal- and Plant Kingdoms was formulated toward the end of the 18th century, well before On the Origin of Species was published.[25] Among early works exploring the idea of a transmutation of species were Erasmus Darwin's 1796 Zo?nomia and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Philosophie Zoologique of 1809.[11] The idea was popularised in the Anglophone world by the speculative but widely read Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, published anonymously by Robert Chambers in 1844.[40]\\r\\nWith Darwin's theory, a general acceptance quickly appeared that a classification should reflect the Darwinian principle of common descent.[41] Tree of Life representations became popular in scientific works, with known fossil groups incorporated. One of the first modern groups tied to fossil ancestors was birds.[42] Using the then newly discovered fossils of Archaeopteryx and Hesperornis, Thomas Henry Huxley pronounced that they had evolved from dinosaurs, a group formally named by Richard Owen in 1842.[43][44] The resulting description, that of dinosaurs \\"giving rise to\\" or being \\"the ancestors of\\" birds, is the essential hallmark of evolutionary taxonomic thinking. As more and more fossil groups were found and recognized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, palaeontologists worked to understand the history of animals through the ages by linking together known groups.[45] With the modern evolutionary synthesis of the early 1940s, an essentially modern understanding of the evolution of the major groups was in place. As evolutionary taxonomy is based on Linnaean taxonomic ranks, the two terms are largely interchangeable in modern use.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe cladistic method (or cladism) has emerged since the 1960s.[41] In 1958, Julian Huxley used the term clade.[11] Later, in 1960, Cain and Harrison introduced the term cladistic.[11] The salient feature is arranging taxa in a hierarchical evolutionary tree, ignoring ranks.[41] A taxon is called monophyletic, if it includes all the descendants of an ancestral form.[46][47] Groups that have descendant groups removed from them (e.g. dinosaurs, with birds as offspring group) are termed paraphyletic,[46] while groups representing more than one branch from the tree of life are called polyphyletic.[46][47] The International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature or PhyloCode is intended to regulate the formal naming of clades.[48][49] Linnaean ranks will be optional under the PhyloCode, which is intended to coexist with the current, rank-based codes.[49]\\r\\nWell before Linnaeus, plants and animals were considered separate Kingdoms.[50] Linnaeus used this as the top rank, dividing the physical world into the plant, animal and mineral kingdoms. As advances in microscopy made classification of microorganisms possible, the number of kingdoms increased, five and six-kingdom systems being the most common.\\r\\nDomains are a relatively new grouping. First proposed in 1977, Carl Woese's three-domain system was not generally accepted until later.[51] One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of Archaea and Bacteria, previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called Monera),[50] with the Eukaryota for all organisms whose cells contain a nucleus.[52] A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, but do not accept the domain method.[50]\\r\\nThomas Cavalier-Smith, who has published extensively on the classification of protists, has recently proposed that the Neomura, the clade that groups together the Archaea and Eucarya, would have evolved from Bacteria, more precisely from Actinobacteria. His 2004 classification treated the archaeobacteria as part of a subkingdom of the Kingdom Bacteria, i.e. he rejected the three-domain system entirely.[53] Stefan Luketa in 2012 proposed a five \\"dominion\\" system, adding Prionobiota (acellular and without nucleic acid) and Virusobiota (acellular but with nucleic acid) to the traditional three domains.[54]\\r\\nPartial classifications exist for many individual groups of organisms and are revised and replaced as new information becomes available, however comprehensive treatments of most or all life are rarer; two recent examples are that of Adl et al., 2012,[61] which covers eukaryotes only with an emphasis on protists, and Ruggiero et al., 2015,[62] covering both eukaryotes and prokaryotes to the rank of Order, although both exclude fossil representatives.[62]\\r\\nBiological taxonomy is a sub-discipline of biology, and is generally practiced by biologists known as \\"taxonomists\\", though enthusiastic naturalists are also frequently involved in the publication of new taxa. The work carried out by taxonomists is crucial for the understanding of biology in general. Two fields of applied biology in which taxonomic work is of fundamental importance are the studies of biodiversity and conservation.[63] Without a working classification of the organisms in any given area, estimating the amount of diversity present is unrealistic, making informed conservation decisions impossible.[citation needed]\\r\\nBiological classification is a critical component of the taxonomic process. As a result, it informs the user as to what the relatives of the taxon are hypothesized to be. Biological classification uses taxonomic ranks, including among others (in order from most inclusive to least inclusive): Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species.[64][Note 1]\\r\\nThe \\"definition\\" of a taxon is encapsulated by its description or its diagnosis or by both combined. There are no set rules governing the definition of taxa, but the naming and publication of new taxa is governed by sets of rules.[8] In zoology, the nomenclature for the more commonly used ranks (superfamily to subspecies), is regulated by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN Code).[65] In the fields of botany, phycology, and mycology, the naming of taxa is governed by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN).[66]\\r\\nThe initial description of a taxon involves five main requirements:[67]\\r\\nHowever, often much more information is included, like the geographic range of the taxon, ecological notes, chemistry, behavior, etc. How researchers arrive at their taxa varies: depending on the available data, and resources, methods vary from simple quantitative or qualitative comparisons of striking features, to elaborate computer analyses of large amounts of DNA sequence data.[68]\\r\\nAn \\"authority\\" may be placed after a scientific name.[69] The authority is the name of the scientist or scientists who first validly published the name.[69] For example, in 1758 Linnaeus gave the Asian elephant the scientific name Elephas maximus, so the name is sometimes written as \\"Elephas maximus Linnaeus, 1758\\".[70] The names of authors are frequently abbreviated: the abbreviation L., for Linnaeus, is commonly used. In botany, there is, in fact, a regulated list of standard abbreviations (see list of botanists by author abbreviation).[71] The system for assigning authorities differs slightly between botany and zoology.[8] However, it is standard that if a species' name or placement has been changed since the original description, the original authority's name is placed in parentheses.[72]\\r\\nIn phenetics, also known as taximetrics, or numerical taxonomy, organisms are classified based on overall similarity, regardless of their phylogeny or evolutionary relationships.[11] It results in a measure of evolutionary \\"distance\\" between taxa. Phenetic methods have become relatively rare in modern times, largely superseded by cladistic analyses, as phenetic methods do not distinguish plesiomorphic[clarification needed] from apomorphic traits.[73] However, certain phenetic methods, such as neighbor joining, have found their way into cladistics, as a reasonable approximation of phylogeny when more advanced methods (such as Bayesian inference) are too computationally expensive.[74]\\r\\nModern taxonomy uses database technologies to search and catalogue classifications and their documentation.[75] While there is no commonly used database, there are comprehensive databases such as the Catalogue of Life, which attempts to list every documented species.[76] The catalogue listed 1.64 million species for all kingdoms as of April 2016, claiming coverage of more than three quarters of the estimated species known to modern science.[77]","input":"Who developed the first widely used system for naming plants and animals?"},{"output":"Cream","context":"Baileys Irish Cream is an Irish whiskey- and cream-based liqueur, made by Gilbeys of Ireland.

While there he received further lessons about the nature of East Indian politics.\\r\\nAt the time, British traders still operated at the whim of local rulers, and so Hastings and his colleagues were unsettled by the political turmoil of Bengal, where the elderly moderate Nawab Alivardi Khan was likely to be succeeded by his grandson Siraj ud-Daulah, although several other rival claimants were eyeing the throne. This made British trading posts throughout Bengal increasingly insecure, as Siraj ud-Daulah was known to harbour anti-European views and be likely to launch an attack once he took power. When Alivardi Khan died in April 1756, the British traders and small garrison at Kasimbazar were left vulnerable. On 3?June, after being surrounded by a much larger force, the British were persuaded to surrender to prevent a massacre taking place.[6] Hastings was imprisoned with others in the Bengali capital, Murshidabad, while the Nawab's forces marched on Calcutta and captured it. The garrison and civilians were then locked up under appalling conditions in the Black Hole of Calcutta.\\r\\nFor a while Hastings remained in Murshidabad and was even used by the Nawab as an intermediary, but fearing for his life, he escaped to the island of Fulta, where a number of refugees from Calcutta had taken shelter. While there, he met and married Mary Buchanan, the widow of one of the victims of the Black Hole. Shortly afterwards a British expedition from Madras under Robert Clive arrived to rescue them. Hastings served as a volunteer in Clive's forces as they retook Calcutta in January 1757. After this swift defeat, the Nawab urgently sought peace and the war came to an end. Clive was impressed with Hastings when he met him, and arranged for his return to Kasimbazar to resume his pre-war activities. Later in 1757 fighting resumed, leading to the Battle of Plassey, where Clive won a decisive victory over the Nawab. Siraj ud-Daulah was overthrown and replaced by his uncle Mir Jafar, who initiated pro-British policies.\\r\\nIn 1758 Hastings became the British Resident in the Bengali capital of Murshidabad ÿ a major step forward in his career ÿ at the instigation of Clive. His role in the city was ostensibly that of an ambassador but as Bengal came increasingly under the dominance of the East India Company he was often given the task of issuing orders to the new Nawab on behalf of Clive and the Calcutta authorities.[7] Hastings personally sympathised with Mir Jafar and regarded many of the demands placed on him by the Company as excessive. Hastings had already developed a philosophy that was grounded in trying to establish a more understanding relationship with India's inhabitants and their rulers, and he often tried to mediate between the two sides.\\r\\nDuring Mir Jafar's reign the East India Company exerted an increasingly large role in the running of the region, and effectively took over the defence of Bengal against external invaders when Bengal's troops proved insufficient for the task. As he grew older, Mir Jafar became gradually less effective in ruling the state, and in 1760 British troops ousted him from power and replaced him with Mir Qasim.[8] Hastings expressed his doubts to Calcutta over the move, believing they were honour-bound to support Mir Jafar, but his opinions were overruled. Hastings established a good relationship with the new Nawab and again had misgivings about the demands he relayed from his superiors. In 1761 he was recalled and appointed to the Calcutta council.\\r\\nHastings was personally angered when he conducted an investigation into trading abuses in Bengal. He alleged some European and British-allied Indian merchants were taking advantage of the situation to enrich themselves personally. Persons travelling under the unauthorised protection of the British flag engaged in widespread fraud and in illegal trading, knowing that local customs officials would thereby be cowed into not interfering with them. Hastings felt this was bringing shame on Britain's reputation, and he urged the ruling authorities in Calcutta to put an end to it. The Council considered his report but ultimately rejected Hastings' proposals and he was fiercely criticised by other members, many of whom had themselves profited from the trade.[9]\\r\\nUltimately, little was done to stem the abuses, and Hastings began to consider quitting his post and returning to Britain. His resignation was only delayed by the outbreak of fresh fighting in Bengal. Once on the throne Qasim proved increasingly independent in his actions, and he rebuilt Bengal's army by hiring European instructors and mercenaries who greatly improved the standard of his forces.[10] He felt gradually more confident and in 1764 when a dispute broke out in the settlement of Patna he captured its British garrison and threatened to execute them if the East India Company responded militarily. When Calcutta dispatched troops anyway, Mir Qasim executed the hostages. British forces then went on the attack and won a series of battles culminating in the decisive Battle of Buxar in October 1764. After this Mir Qasim fled into exile in Delhi, where he later died (1777). The Treaty of Allahabad (1765) gave the East India Company the right to collect taxes in Bengal on behalf of the Mughal Emperor.\\r\\nHastings resigned in December 1764 and sailed for Britain the following month. He left deeply saddened by the failure of the more moderate strategy that he had supported, but which had been rejected by the hawkish members of the Calcutta Council. Once he arrived in London Hastings began spending far beyond his means. He stayed in fashionable addresses and had his picture painted by Joshua Reynolds in spite of the fact that, unlike many of his contemporaries, he had not amassed a fortune while in India. Eventually, having run up enormous debts, Hastings realised he needed to return to India to restore his finances, and applied to the East India Company for employment. His application was initially rejected as he had made many political enemies, including the powerful director Laurence Sulivan. Eventually an appeal to Sulivan's rival Robert Clive secured Hastings the position of deputy ruler at the city of Madras. He sailed from Dover in March 1769. On the voyage he met the German Baroness Imhoff and her husband. He soon fell in love with the Baroness and they began an affair, seemingly with her husband's consent. Hastings' first wife, Mary, had died in 1759, and he planned to marry the Baroness once she had obtained a divorce from her husband. The process took a long time and it was not until 1777 when news of divorce came from Germany that Hastings was finally able to marry her.\\r\\nHastings arrived in Madras shortly after the end of the First Anglo-Mysore War of 1767ÿ1769, during which the forces of Hyder Ali had threatened the capture of the city. The Treaty of Madras (29 March 1769) which ended the war failed to settle the dispute and three further Anglo-Mysore Wars followed (1780-1799). During his time at Madras Hastings initiated reforms of trading practices which cut out the use of middlemen and benefited both the Company and the Indian labourers, but otherwise the period was relatively uneventful for him.[11]\\r\\nBy this stage Hastings shared Clive's view that the three major British Presidencies (settlements) ÿ Madras, Bombay and Calcutta ÿ should all be brought under a single rule rather than being governed separately as they currently were.[11] In 1771 he was appointed to be Governor of Calcutta, the most important of the Presidencies. In Britain moves were underway to reform the divided system of government and to establish a single rule across all of British India with its capital in Calcutta. Hastings was considered[by whom?] the natural choice to be the first Governor General.\\r\\nWhile Governor, Hastings launched a major crackdown on bandits operating in Bengal, which proved largely successful.\\r\\nHe also faced the severe Bengal Famine, which resulted in about ten million deaths.\\r\\nIn 1774,[12] he was appointed the first Governor-General of Bengal. He was also the first governor of India.[13]:190 The post was new, and British mechanisms to administer the territory were not fully developed. Regardless of his title, Hastings was only a member of a five-man Supreme Council of Bengal[13]:190 so confusedly structured that it was difficult to tell what constitutional position Hastings actually held.[14]\\r\\nIn 1773, Hastings responded to an appeal for help from the Raja of the princely state of Cooch Behar to the north of Bengal, whose territory had been invaded by Zhidar, the Druk Desi of Bhutan the previous year. Hastings agreed to help on the condition that Cooch Behar recognise British sovereignty.[15] The Raja agreed and with the help of British troops they pushed the Bhutanese out of the Duars and into the foothills in 1773.\\r\\nThe Druk Desi, returned to face civil war at home. His opponent Jigme Senge, the regent for the seven-year-old Shabdrung (the Bhutanese equivalent of the Dalai Lama), had supported popular discontent. Zhidar was unpopular for his corvee tax (he sought to rebuild a major dzong in one year, an unreasonable goal), as well as for his overtures to the Manchu Emperors which threatened Bhutanese independence. Zhidar was soon overthrown and forced to flee to Tibet, where he was imprisoned and a new Druk Desi, Kunga Rinchen, installed in his place. Meanwhile, the Sixth Panchen Lama, who had imprisoned Zhidar, interceded on behalf of the Bhutanese with a letter to Hastings, imploring him to cease hostilities in return for friendship. Hastings saw the opportunity to establish relations with both the Tibetans and the Bhutanese and wrote a letter to the Panchen Lama proposing \\"a general treaty of amity and commerce between Tibet and Bengal.\\"[16]\\r\\nIn February 1782, news having reached the headquarters of the EIC in Calcutta of the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, Hastings proposed despatching a mission to Tibet with a message of congratulation designed to strengthen the amicable relations established by Bogle during his earlier visit. With the assent of the EIC Court of Directors, Samuel Turner was appointed chief of the Tibet mission on 9?January 1783 with fellow EIC employee and amateur artist Samuel Davis as \\"Draftsman & Surveyor\\".[17] Turner returned to the Governor-General's camp at Patna in 1784 where he reported that although unable to visit the Tibetan capital at Lhasa, he had received a promise that merchants sent to the country from India would be encouraged.[18]\\r\\nTurner was also instructed to obtain a pair of yaks on his travels, which he duly did. They were transported to Hasting's menagerie in Calcutta and on the Governor-General's return to England, the yaks went too, although only the male survived the difficult sea voyage. Noted artist George Stubbs subsequently painted the animal's portrait as The Yak of Tartary and in 1854 it went on to appear, albeit stuffed, at The Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace in London.[19]\\r\\nHasting's return to England ended any further efforts to engage in diplomacy with Tibet.\\r\\nIn 1784, after ten years of service, during which he helped extend and regularise the nascent Raj created by Clive of India, Hastings resigned.\\r\\nUpon his return to England he was impeached in the House of Commons for crimes and misdemeanors during his time in India, especially for the alleged judicial killing of Maharaja Nandakumar. At first deemed unlikely to succeed,[20] the prosecution was managed by MPs including Edmund Burke, who was encouraged by Sir Philip Francis, whom Hastings had wounded during a duel in India,[13]:190 Charles James Fox and Richard Brinsley Sheridan. When the charges of his indictment were read, the twenty counts took Edmund Burke two full days to read.[21]\\r\\nThe house sat for a total of 148 days over a period of seven years during the investigation.[22] The investigation was pursued at great cost to Hastings personally, and he complained constantly that the cost of defending himself from the prosecution was bankrupting him. He is rumoured to have once stated that the punishment given him would have been less extreme had he pleaded guilty.[23] The House of Lords finally made its decision on 24 April 1795, acquitting him on all charges.[24] The Company subsequently compensated him with 4,000 Pounds Sterling annually.\\r\\nThroughout the long years of the trial, Hastings lived in considerable style at his town house, Somerset House, Park Lane.[25] Among the many who supported him in print was the pamphleteer and versifier Ralph Broome.[26] Others disturbed by the perceived injustice of the proceedings included Fanny Burney.[27]\\r\\nThe letters and journals of Jane Austen and her family, who knew Hastings, show that they followed the trial closely.\\r\\nHis supporters from the Edinburgh East India Club, as well as a number of other gentlemen from India, gave a reportedly \\"elegant entertainment\\" for Hastings when he visited Edinburgh. A toast on the occasion went to the \\"Prosperity to our settlements in India\\" and wished that \\"the virtue and talents which preserved them be ever remembered with gratitude.\\"[28]\\r\\nIn 1788 he acquired the estate at Daylesford, Gloucestershire, including the site of the medieval seat of the Hastings family. In the following years, he remodelled the mansion to the designs of Samuel Pepys Cockerell, with classical and Indian decoration, and gardens landscaped by John Davenport. He also rebuilt the Norman church in 1816, where he was buried two years later.\\r\\nIn 1801 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.[29]\\r\\nDuring the final quarter of the 18th century, many of the Company's senior administrators realised that, in order to govern Indian society, it was essential that they learn its various religious, social, and legal customs and precedents. The importance of such knowledge to the colonial government was clearly in Hastings's mind when, in 1784, he remarked:\\r\\nEvery application of knowledge and especially such as is obtained in social communication with people, over whom we exercise dominion, founded on the right of conquest, is useful to the state ... It attracts and conciliates distant affections, it lessens the weight of the chain by which the natives are held in subjection and it imprints on the hearts of our countrymen the sense of obligation and benevolence... Every instance which brings their real character will impress us with more generous sense of feeling for their natural rights, and teach us to estimate them by the measure of our own... But such instances can only be gained in their writings; and these will survive when British domination in India shall have long ceased to exist, and when the sources which once yielded of wealth and power are lost to remembrance[30]\\r\\nUnder Hastings's term as governor-general, a great deal of administrative precedent was set which profoundly shaped later attitudes towards the government of British India. Hastings had a great respect for the ancient scripture of Hinduism and set the British position on governance as one of looking back to the earliest precedents possible. This allowed Brahmin advisors to mould the law, because no English person thoroughly understood Sanskrit until Sir William Jones, and, even then, a literal translation was of little use; it needed to be elucidated by religious commentators who were well-versed in the lore and application. This approach accentuated the Hindu caste system and to an extent the frameworks of other religions, which had, at least in recent centuries, been somewhat more flexibly applied. Thus, British influence on the fluid social structure of India can in large part be characterised as a solidification of the privileges of the Hindu caste system through the influence of the exclusively high-caste scholars by whom the British were advised in the formation of their laws.\\r\\nIn 1781, Hastings founded Madrasa 'Aliya; in 2007, it was transformed into Aliah University by the Government of India, at Calcutta. In 1784, Hastings supported the foundation of the Bengal Asiatic Society, now the Asiatic Society of Bengal, by the oriental scholar Sir William Jones; it became a storehouse for information and data on the subcontinent and has existed in various institutional guises up to the present day.[31] Hastings' legacy has been somewhat dualistic as an Indian administrator: he undoubtedly was able to institute reforms during the time he spent as governor there that would change the path that India would follow over the next several years. He did, however, retain the strange distinction of being both the \\"architect of British India and the one ruler of British India to whom the creation of such an entity was anathema.\\"[32]\\r\\nThe city of Hastings, New Zealand and the Melbourne outer suburb of Hastings, Victoria, Australia were both named after him.\\r\\n\\"Hastings\\" is the name of one of the 4 School Houses in La Martiniere for Boys, Calcutta and La Martiniere for Girls Kolkata. It is represented by the colour red.\\r\\n\\"Hastings\\" is also the name of one of the 4 School Houses in Bishop Westcott Boys' School, Ranchi. It is also represented by the colour red.\\r\\n\\"Hastings\\" is a Senior Wing House at St Paul's School, Darjeeling, India, where all the senior wing houses are named after Anglo-Indian colonial figures.\\r\\nThere is also a road in Kolkata, India, named after him.\\r\\nWarren Hastings took keen interest in translating the Bhagavad Gita into English, and as a result of his efforts the first English translation appeared in 1785. Warren Hastings wrote the introduction to the English translation of the Bhagavad Gita, dated 4 October 1784, from Benares.[33]\\r\\n\\"Warren Hastings and His Bull\\" is a short story written by Indian writer Uday Prakash. It was adapted for stage under the same name by the director Arvind Gaur. It is a socio-economic political satire that presents Warren Hastings's interaction with traditional India.","input":"Who was the first britis governor general of india?"},{"output":"as soon as 4 hours post mortem","context":"Rigor mortis (Latin: rigor \\"stiffness\\", mortis \\"of death\\") or postmortem rigidity, the third stage of death, is one of the recognizable signs of death, caused by chemical changes in the muscles post mortem, which cause the limbs of the corpse to stiffen.[1] In humans, rigor mortis can occur as soon as 4 hours post mortem.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter death, respiration in an organism ceases, depleting the source of oxygen used in the making of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is required to cause separation of the actin-myosin cross-bridges during relaxation of muscle.[2] When oxygen is no longer present, the body may continue to produce ATP via anaerobic glycolysis. When the body's glycogen is depleted, the ATP concentration diminishes, and the body enters rigor mortis because it is unable to break those bridges.[3]\\r\\nAdditionally, calcium enters the cytosol after death. Calcium is released into the cytosol due to the deterioration of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Also, the breakdown of the sarcolemma causes additional calcium to enter the cytosol. The calcium activates the formation of actin-myosin cross-bridging. Once calcium is introduced into the cytosol, it binds to the troponin of thin filaments, which causes the troponin-tropomyosin complex to change shape and allow the myosin heads to bind to the active sites of actin proteins.[1] In rigor mortis myosin heads continue binding with the active sites of actin proteins via adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the muscle is unable to relax until further enzyme activity degrades the complex.[2]\\r\\nNormal relaxation would occur by replacing ADP with ATP, which would destabilize the myosin-actin bond and break the cross-bridge.[1] However, as ATP is absent, there must be a breakdown of muscle tissue by enzymes (endogenous or bacterial) during decomposition. As part of the process of decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the muscle contraction to release and the body to relax.[4][5] Decomposition of the myofilaments occurs 48 to 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which occurs approximately 13 hours after death.[1]\\r\\nAt the time of death, a condition called \\"primary flaccidity\\" occurs. Following this, the muscles stiffen in rigor mortis. All muscles in the body are affected. Starting between two and six hours following death, rigor mortis begins with the eyelids, neck, and jaw. The sequence may be due to different lactic acid levels among different muscles, which is directly related to the difference in glycogen levels and different types of muscle fibers.\\r\\nRigor mortis then spreads to the other muscles, including the internal organs, within the next four to six hours. The onset of rigor mortis is affected by the individual's age, sex, physical condition, and muscular build. Rigor mortis may not be perceivable in many infant and child corpses due to their smaller muscle mass.[6]\\r\\nRigor mortis is very important in meat technology. The onset of rigor mortis and its resolution partially determine the tenderness of meat. If the post-slaughter meat is immediately chilled to 15?C (59?F), a phenomenon known as cold shortening occurs, whereby the muscle sarcomeres shrink to a third of their original length.\\r\\nCold shortening is caused by the release of stored calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle fibers, in response to the cold stimulus. The calcium ions trigger powerful muscle contraction aided by ATP molecules. To prevent cold shortening, a process known as electrical stimulation is carried out, especially in beef carcasses, immediately after slaughter and skinning. In this process, the carcass is stimulated with alternating current, causing it to contract and relax, which depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass and prevents cold shortening.[7]\\r\\nThe degree of rigor mortis may be used in forensic pathology, to determine the approximate time of death. A dead body holds its position as rigor mortis sets in. If the body is moved after death, but before rigor mortis begins, forensic techniques such as livor mortis can be applied. If the position in which a body is found does not match the location where it is found (for example, if it is flat on its back with one arm sticking straight up), that could mean someone moved it.\\r\\nSeveral factors also affect the progression of rigor mortis, and investigators take these into account when estimating the time of death. One such factor is the ambient temperature. When conditions are warm, the onset and pace of rigor mortis are sped up by providing a conducive environment for the metabolic processes that cause decay. Low temperatures, however, slow them down. Therefore, for a person who dies outside in frozen conditions rigor mortis may last several days more than normal, so investigators may have to abandon it as a tool for determining time of death.[8][9]","input":"How long does it take for rigamortis to set in after you die?"},{"output":"hiring an external organization to perform some business functions (\\"Outsourcing\\") in a country other than the one where the products or services are actually developed or manufactured (\\"Offshore\\")","context":"Offshore outsourcing is the practice of hiring an external organization to perform some business functions (\\"Outsourcing\\") in a country other than the one where the products or services are actually developed or manufactured (\\"Offshore\\"). It can be contrasted with offshoring, in which a company moves itself entirely to another country, or where functions are performed in a foreign country by a foreign subsidiary. Opponents point out that the practice of sending work overseas by countries with higher wages reduces their own domestic employment and domestic investment. Many customer service jobs as well as jobs in the information technology sectors (data processing, computer programming, and technical support) in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom - have been or are potentially affected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are four basic types of offshore outsourcing:\\r\\nThe general criteria for a job to be offshore-able are:\\r\\nThe driving factor behind the development of offshore outsourcing has been the need to cut costs while the enabling factor has been the global electronic internet network that allows digital data to be accessed and delivered instantly, from and to almost anywhere in the world.\\r\\nSome of the major countries/districts that provide such services, among many others, are:-\\r\\nThe widespread use and availability of the Internet has enabled individuals and small businesses to contract freelancers from all over the world to get projects done at a lower cost due to lower wages and property prices. Crowdsourcing systems such as Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower have added the element of scalability, allowing businesses to outsource information tasks across the Internet to thousands of workers.\\r\\nThis trend runs in parallel with the tendency towards outsourcing in larger corporations, and may serve to strengthen small business' capacity to compete with their larger competitors (who are capable of setting up offshore locations) or arrive at major contracts with offshore companies.\\r\\nOn the other hand, according to Gartner, it also helped with accessibility to labor resources across the world, regardless of company size.[1] It gave rise to business models such as Remote In-Sourcing that allow companies to tap into resources found abroad, without losing control over security of product quality. The resulting ability to work remotely and online, will continue to have a huge impact on the overall development of the global economy, for small companies and for large corporations.\\r\\nThere are different views on the impact of offshore outsourcing on the various societies affected, which reflects the attitude of Protectionism versus Free Trade. Some see it as a potential threat to the domestic job market in the developed world and ask for government protective measures (or at least closer scrutiny of existing trade practices), while others, including the countries who receive the work, see it as an opportunity. In fact, offshore outsourcing has led to Domestic factories and companies closing down leaving tens of thousands of U.S. workers jobless while underdeveloped countries such as Brazil, Turkey, etc. begin to flourish.[2] Free-trade advocates suggest economies as a whole will obtain a net benefit from labor offshoring, but it is unclear if the displaced receive a net benefit.\\r\\nMany companies offshore outsource because the wages are cheaper in other areas. This is beginning to create a conflict because many wages overseas are raising. For example, a study by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found that Chinese wages were almost tripled in the seven years following 2002. The wage increases could change the set up of offshore outsourcing in years to come.[3]\\r\\nOne issue offshoring of technical services has brought more attention to is the value of education as an alleged solution to trade-related displacements. Education may no longer be a comparative advantage of high-wage nations because the cost of education may be lower in the nations involved in the controversy. [1] While it is true that education is usually considered helpful to competitiveness in general, an \\"education arms race\\" with low-wage nations may not pay off.","input":"What does offshore outsourcing or contracting out mean?"},{"output":"July 1, 2004","context":"September 15, 2017\\r\\nThe CassiniÿHuygens mission (/k??si?ni ?h???nz/ k?-SEE-nee HOY-g?nz), commonly called Cassini, was a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) to send a probe to study the planet Saturn and its system, including its rings and natural satellites. The Flagship-class unmanned robotic spacecraft comprised both NASA's Cassini probe, and ESA's Huygens lander which would be landed on Saturn's largest moon, Titan.[7] Cassini was the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter its orbit. The craft were named after astronomers Giovanni Cassini and Christiaan Huygens.\\r\\nLaunched aboard a Titan IVB/Centaur on October 15, 1997, Cassini was active in space for nearly 20 years, with 13 years spent orbiting Saturn, studying the planet and its system after entering orbit on July 1, 2004.[8] The voyage to Saturn included flybys of Venus (April 1998 and July 1999), Earth (August 1999), the asteroid 2685 Masursky, and Jupiter (December 2000). Its mission ended on September 15, 2017, when Cassini's trajectory took it into Saturn's upper atmosphere and it burned up[9][10] in order to prevent any risk of contaminating Saturn's moons, which might have offered habitable environments to stowaway terrestrial microbes on the spacecraft.[11][12] The mission is widely perceived to have been successful beyond expectation. Cassini-Huygens has been described by NASA's Planetary Science Division Director as a \\"mission of firsts\\",[13] that has revolutionized human understanding of the Saturn system, including its moons and rings, and our understanding of where life might be found in the Solar System.\\r\\nCassini's original mission was planned to last for four years, from June 2004 to May 2008. The mission was extended for another two years until September 2010, branded the Cassini Equinox Mission. The mission was extended a second and final time with the Cassini Solstice Mission, lasting another seven years until September 15, 2017, on which date Cassini was de-orbited to burn up in Saturn's upper atmosphere.\\r\\nThe Huygens module traveled with Cassini until its separation from the probe on December 25, 2004; it was landed by parachute on Titan on January 14, 2005. It returned data to Earth for around 90 minutes, using the orbiter as a relay. This was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer Solar System and the first landing on a moon other than our own.\\r\\nAt the end of its mission, the Cassini spacecraft executed the \\"Grand Finale\\" of its mission: a number of risky passes through the gaps between Saturn and Saturn's inner rings.[4][5] The purpose of this phase was to maximize Cassini's scientific outcome before the spacecraft was disposed.[14] The atmospheric entry of Cassini ended the mission, but analyses of the returned data will continue for many years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTeams from 28 countries made up the joint team responsible for designing, building, flying and collecting data from the Cassini orbiter and Huygens probe.\\r\\nThe mission was managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the United States, where the orbiter was assembled. Huygens was developed by the European Space Research and Technology Centre. The Centre's prime contractor, Arospatiale of France (now Thales Alenia Space), assembled the probe with equipment and instruments supplied by many European countries (Huygens' batteries and two scientific instruments by the United States). The Italian Space Agency (ASI) provided the Cassini orbiter's high-gain radio antenna, with the incorporation of a low-gain antenna (to ensure telecommunications with the Earth for the entire duration of the mission), a compact and lightweight radar, which also uses the high-gain antenna and serves as a synthetic-aperture radar, a radar altimeter, a radiometer, the radio science subsystem (RSS), the visible channel portion VIMS-V of VIMS spectrometer.[15]\\r\\nThe VIMS infrared counterpart was provided by NASA, as well as Main Electronic Assembly, which includes electronic subassemblies provided by CNES of France.[16][17]\\r\\nOn April 16, 2008, NASA announced a two-year extension of the funding for ground operations of this mission, at which point it was renamed the Cassini Equinox Mission.[18] The round of funding was again extended in February 2010 with the Cassini Solstice Mission.\\r\\nThe mission consisted of two main elements: the ASI/NASA Cassini orbiter, named for the Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, discoverer of Saturn's ring divisions and four of its satellites; and the ESA-developed Huygens probe, named for the Dutch astronomer, mathematician and physicist Christiaan Huygens, discoverer of Titan.\\r\\nThe mission was commonly called Saturn Orbiter Titan Probe (SOTP) during gestation, both as a Mariner Mark II mission and generically.\\r\\nCassini-Huygens was a Flagship-class mission to the outer planets.[7] The other planetary flagships include Galileo, Voyager, and Viking.[7]\\r\\nCassini had several objectives, including:[19]\\r\\nCassiniÿHuygens was launched on October 15, 1997, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Space Launch Complex?40 using a U.S.?Air Force Titan IVB/Centaur rocket. The complete launcher was made up of a two-stage Titan IV booster rocket, two strap-on solid rocket motors, the Centaur upper stage, and a payload enclosure, or fairing.[20]\\r\\nThe total cost of this scientific exploration mission was about US$3.26?billion, including $1.4?billion for pre-launch development, $704 million for mission operations, $54?million for tracking and $422?million for the launch vehicle. The United States contributed $2.6?billion (80%), the ESA $500?million (15%), and the ASI $160?million (5%).[21] However, these figures are from the press kit which was prepared in October 2000. They do not include inflation over the course of a very long mission, nor do they include the cost of the extended missions.\\r\\nThe primary mission for Cassini was completed on July 30, 2008. The mission was extended to June 2010 (Cassini Equinox Mission).[22] This studied the Saturn system in detail during the planet's equinox, which happened in August 2009.[18]\\r\\nOn February 3, 2010, NASA announced another extension for Cassini, lasting 6?1?2?years until 2017, ending at the time of summer solstice in Saturn's northern hemisphere (Cassini Solstice Mission). The extension enabled another 155?revolutions around the planet, 54?flybys of Titan and 11?flybys of Enceladus.[23] In 2017, an encounter with Titan changed its orbit in such a way that, at closest approach to Saturn, it was only 3,000?km above the planet's cloudtops, below the inner edge of the D ring. This sequence of \\"proximal orbits\\" ended when its final encounter with Titan sent the probe into Saturn's atmosphere to be destroyed.\\r\\nCassiniÿHuygens's origins date to 1982, when the European Science Foundation and the American National Academy of Sciences formed a working group to investigate future cooperative missions. Two European scientists suggested a paired Saturn Orbiter and Titan Probe as a possible joint mission. In 1983, NASA's Solar System Exploration Committee recommended the same Orbiter and Probe pair as a core NASA project. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) performed a joint study of the potential mission from 1984 to 1985. ESA continued with its own study in 1986, while the American astronaut Sally Ride, in her influential 1987 report NASA Leadership and America's Future in Space, also examined and approved of the Cassini mission.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhile Ride's report described the Saturn orbiter and probe as a NASA solo mission, in 1988 the Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications of NASA, Len Fisk, returned to the idea of a joint NASA and ESA mission. He wrote to his counterpart at ESA, Roger Bonnet, strongly suggesting that ESA choose the Cassini mission from the three candidates at hand and promising that NASA would commit to the mission as soon as ESA did.[citation needed]\\r\\nAt the time, NASA was becoming more sensitive to the strain that had developed between the American and European space programs as a result of European perceptions that NASA had not treated it like an equal during previous collaborations. NASA officials and advisers involved in promoting and planning CassiniÿHuygens attempted to correct this trend by stressing their desire to evenly share any scientific and technology benefits resulting from the mission. In part, this newfound spirit of cooperation with Europe was driven by a sense of competition with the Soviet Union, which had begun to cooperate more closely with Europe as ESA drew further away from NASA. Late in 1988, ESA chose CassiniÿHuygens as its next major mission and the following year the program received major funding in the US.[24][25]\\r\\nThe collaboration not only improved relations between the two space programs but also helped CassiniÿHuygens survive congressional budget cuts in the United States. CassiniÿHuygens came under fire politically in both 1992 and 1994, but NASA successfully persuaded the U.S. Congress that it would be unwise to halt the project after ESA had already poured funds into development because frustration on broken space exploration promises might spill over into other areas of foreign relations. The project proceeded politically smoothly after 1994, although citizens' groups concerned about its potential environmental impact attempted to derail it through protests and lawsuits until and past its 1997 launch.[26][27][28][29][30]\\r\\nThe spacecraft was planned to be the second three-axis stabilized, RTG-powered Mariner Mark II, a class of spacecraft developed for missions beyond the orbit of Mars.\\r\\nCassini was developed simultaneously with the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft, but budget cuts and project rescopings forced NASA to terminate CRAF development to save Cassini. As a result, Cassini became more specialized. The Mariner Mark?II series was cancelled.\\r\\nIncluding the orbiter and probe, it has been the second-largest unmanned interplanetary spacecraft built,[31][32] as well as being among the most complex.[31] The orbiter had a mass of 2,150?kg (4,740?lb), the probe 350?kg (770?lb). With the launch vehicle adapter and 3,132?kg (6,905?lb) of propellants at launch, the spacecraft had a mass of 5,600?kg (12,300?lb). Only the two Phobos 1 and 2 spacecraft sent to Mars by the Soviet Union were larger.\\r\\nThe Cassini spacecraft was 6.8 meters (22?ft) high and 4 meters (13?ft) wide. Spacecraft complexity was increased by its trajectory (flight path) to Saturn, and by the ambitious science at its destination. Cassini had 1,630 interconnected electronic components, 22,000 wire connections, and 14 kilometers (8.7?mi) of cabling.[citation needed] The core control computer CPU was a redundant MIL-STD-1750A system. The main propulsion system consisted of one prime and one backup R-4D bipropellant rocket engine. The thrust of each engine was 490 newtons and the total spacecraft delta-v was about 2,040 meters per second.[33] Smaller monopropellant rockets provided attitude control.\\r\\nCassini was powered by 32.7?kg[34] of plutonium-238the heat from the material's radioactive decay was turned into electricity. Huygens was supported by Cassini during cruise, but used chemical batteries when independent.\\r\\nThe probe contained a DVD with more than 616,400 signatures from citizens in 81 countries, collected in a public campaign.[35] [36]\\r\\nUntil September 2017 the Cassini probe continued orbiting Saturn at a distance of between 8.2 and 10.2 astronomical units from the Earth. It took 68 to 84 minutes for radio signals to travel from Earth to the spacecraft, and vice versa. Thus ground controllers could not give \\"real-time\\" instructions for daily operations or for unexpected events. Even if response were immediate, more than two hours would have passed between the occurrence of a problem and the reception of the engineers' response by the satellite.\\r\\nInstruments:[38]\\r\\nCassini's instrumentation consisted of: a synthetic aperture radar mapper, a charge-coupled device imaging system, a visible/infrared mapping spectrometer, a composite infrared spectrometer, a cosmic dust analyzer, a radio and plasma wave experiment, a plasma spectrometer, an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph, a magnetospheric imaging instrument, a magnetometer and an ion/neutral mass spectrometer. Telemetry from the communications antenna and other special transmitters (an S-band transmitter and a dual-frequency Ka-band system) was also used to make observations of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn and to measure the gravity fields of the planet and its satellites.\\r\\nBecause of Saturn's distance from the Sun, solar arrays were not feasible as power sources for this space probe.[48] To generate enough power, such arrays would have been too large and too heavy.[48] Instead, the Cassini orbiter was powered by three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), which use heat from the natural decay of about 33?kg (73?lb) of plutonium-238 (in the form of plutonium dioxide) to generate direct current electricity via thermoelectrics.[48] The RTGs on the Cassini mission have the same design as those used on the New Horizons, Galileo, and Ulysses space probes, and they were designed to have very long operational lifetimes.[48] At the end of the nominal 11-year Cassini mission, they were still able to produce 600 to 700 watts of electrical power.[48] (One of the spare RTGs for the Cassini mission was used to power the New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper belt, which was designed and launched later.[citation needed])\\r\\nTo gain momentum while already in flight, the trajectory of the Cassini mission included several gravitational slingshot maneuvers: two fly-by passes of Venus, one more of the Earth, and then one of the planet Jupiter. The terrestrial flyby was the final instance when the probe posed any conceivable danger to human beings. The maneuver was successful, with Cassini passing by 1,171?km (728?mi) above the Earth on August 18, 1999.[49] Had there been any malfunction causing the probe to collide with the Earth, NASA's complete environmental impact study estimated that, in the worst case (with an acute angle of entry in which Cassini would gradually burn up), a significant fraction of the 33?kg[34] of plutonium-238 inside the RTGs would have been dispersed into the Earth's atmosphere so that up to five billion people (i.e. almost the entire terrestrial population) could have been exposed, causing up to an estimated 5,000 additional cancer deaths over the subsequent decades[50] (0.0005 per cent, i.e. a fraction 0.000005, of a billion cancer deaths expected anyway from other causes; the product is incorrectly calculated elsewhere[51] as 500,000 deaths). However, the chance of this happening were estimated to be less than one in one million.[50]\\r\\nThe Cassini spacecraft was capable of transmitting in several different telemetry formats. The telemetry subsystem is perhaps the most important subsystem, because without it there could be no data return.\\r\\nThe telemetry was developed from ground up, due to the spacecraft using a more modern set of computers than previous missions.[52] Therefore, Cassini was the first spacecraft to adopt mini-packets to reduce the complexity of the Telemetry Dictionary, and the software development process led to the creation of a Telemetry Manager for the mission.\\r\\nThere were around 1088 channels (in 67 mini-packets) assembled in the Cassini Telemetry Dictionary. Out of these 67 lower complexity mini-packets, 6 mini-packets contained the subsystem covariance and Kalman gain elements (161 measurements), not used during normal mission operations. This left 947 measurements in 61 mini-packets.\\r\\nA total of seven telemetry maps corresponding to 7 AACS telemetry modes were constructed. These modes are: (1) Record; (2) Nominal Cruise; (3) Medium Slow Cruise; (4) Slow Cruise; (5) Orbital Ops; (6) Av; (7) ATE (Attitude Estimator) Calibration. These 7 maps cover all spacecraft telemetry modes.\\r\\nThe Huygens probe, supplied by the European Space Agency (ESA) and named after the 17th?century Dutch astronomer who first discovered Titan, Christiaan Huygens, scrutinized the clouds, atmosphere, and surface of Saturn's moon Titan in its descent on January 15, 2005. It was designed to enter and brake in Titan's atmosphere and parachute a fully instrumented robotic laboratory down to the surface.[53]\\r\\nThe probe system consisted of the probe itself which descended to Titan, and the probe support equipment (PSE) which remained attached to the orbiting spacecraft. The PSE includes electronics that track the probe, recover the data gathered during its descent, and process and deliver the data to the orbiter that transmits it to Earth. The core control computer CPU was a redundant MIL-STD-1750A control system.\\r\\nThe data were transmitted by a radio link between Huygens and Cassini provided by Probe Data Relay Subsystem (PDRS). As the probe's mission could not be telecommanded from Earth because of the great distance, it was automatically managed by the Command Data Management Subsystem (CDMS). The PDRS and CDMS were provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI).\\r\\nAfter Cassini's launch, it was discovered that data sent back from the probe to European Space Agency's mission control center was largely unreadable. It was determined that Cassini's receiver was unable to accurately process the changes in frequency and wavelength of the signal it would be receiving from Huygens during its descent to Titan.[14] The problem was rectified by changing the distance and angle of Cassini's trajectory to Huygens during the landing.[14][54]\\r\\nThe Cassini space probe performed two gravitational-assist flybys of Venus on April 26, 1998, and June 24, 1999. These flybys provided the space probe with enough momentum to travel all the way out to the asteroid belt. At that point, the Sun's gravity pulled the space probe back into the inner Solar System.\\r\\nOn August 18, 1999, at 03:28?UTC, the craft made a gravitational-assist flyby of the Earth. One hour and 20?minutes before closest approach, Cassini made its closest approach to the Earth's Moon at 377,000 kilometers, and it took a series of calibration photos.\\r\\nOn January 23, 2000, Cassini performed a flyby of the asteroid 2685 Masursky at around 10:00 UTC. It took photos[55] in the period five to seven hours before the flyby at a distance of 1.6?million kilometers, and a diameter of 15 to 20?km was estimated for the asteroid.\\r\\nCassini made its closest approach to Jupiter on December 30, 2000, and made many scientific measurements. About 26,000 images of Jupiter, its faint rings, and its moons were taken during the six month flyby. It produced the most detailed global color portrait of the planet yet (see image at right), in which the smallest visible features are approximately 60?km (37?mi) across.[56]\\r\\nA major finding of the flyby, announced on March 6, 2003, was of Jupiter's atmospheric circulation. Dark \\"belts\\" alternate with light \\"zones\\" in the atmosphere, and scientists had long considered the zones, with their pale clouds, to be areas of upwelling air, partly because many clouds on Earth form where air is rising. But analysis of Cassini imagery showed that individual storm cells of upwelling bright-white clouds, too small to see from Earth, pop up almost without exception in the dark belts. According to Anthony Del Genio of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, \\"the belts must be the areas of net-rising atmospheric motion on Jupiter, [so] the net motion in the zones has to be sinking.\\"\\r\\nOther atmospheric observations included a swirling dark oval of high atmospheric-haze, about the size of the Great Red Spot, near Jupiter's north pole. Infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles, with bands of globe-encircling winds, with adjacent bands moving in opposite directions.\\r\\nThe same announcement also discussed the nature of Jupiter's rings. Light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originate as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on Jupiter's moons, probably Metis and Adrastea.\\r\\nOn October 10, 2003, the mission's science team announced the results of tests of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, performed by using radio waves transmitted from the Cassini space probe.[57] The radio scientists measured a frequency shift in the radio waves to and from the spacecraft, as those passed close to the Sun. According to the general theory of relativity, a massive object like the Sun causes space-time to curve, causing a beam of radiowaves (or light, or any form of electromagnetic radiation) that passes by the Sun to travel farther (known as the Shapiro time delay).\\r\\nAlthough some measurable deviations from the values calculated using the general theory of relativity are predicted by some unusual cosmological models, no such deviations were found by this experiment. Previous tests using radiowaves transmitted by the Viking and Voyager space probes were in agreement with the calculated values from general relativity to within an accuracy of one part in one thousand. The more refined measurements from the Cassini space probe experiment improved this accuracy to about one part in 51,000.[58] The data firmly support Einstein's general theory of relativity.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn total, the Cassini mission discovered seven new moons orbiting Saturn.[59] Using images taken by Cassini, researchers discovered Methone, Pallene and Polydeuces in 2004,[60] although later analysis revealed that Voyager 2 had photographed Pallene in its 1981 flyby of the ringed planet.[61]\\r\\nOn May 1, 2005, a new moon was discovered by Cassini in the Keeler gap. It was given the designation S/2005?S?1 before being named Daphnis. A fifth new moon was discovered by Cassini on May 30, 2007, and was provisionally labeled S/2007 S 4. It is now known as Anthe. A press release on February 3, 2009 showed a sixth new moon found by Cassini. The moon is approximately 1/3 of a mile (500?m) in diameter within the G-ring of the ring system of Saturn, and is now named Aegaeon (formerly S/2008 S 1).[62] A press release on November 2, 2009 mentions the seventh new moon found by Cassini on July 26, 2009. It is presently labeled S/2009 S 1 and is approximately 300?m (1000?ft) in diameter in the B-ring system.[63]\\r\\nOn April 14, 2014, NASA scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon in the A Ring of the planet Saturn.[64]\\r\\nOn June 11, 2004, Cassini flew by the moon Phoebe. This was the first opportunity for close-up studies of this moon (Voyager 2 performed a distant flyby in 1981 but returned no detailed images). It also was Cassini's only possible flyby for Phoebe due to the mechanics of the available orbits around Saturn.[65]\\r\\nThe first close-up images were received on June 12, 2004, and mission scientists immediately realized that the surface of Phoebe looks different from asteroids visited by spacecraft. Parts of the heavily cratered surface look very bright in those pictures, and it is currently believed that a large amount of water ice exists under its immediate surface.\\r\\nIn an announcement on June 28, 2004, Cassini program scientists described the measurement of the rotational period of Saturn.[66] Because there are no fixed features on the surface that can be used to obtain this period, the repetition of radio emissions was used. This new data agreed with the latest values measured from Earth, and constituted a puzzle to the scientists. It turns out that the radio rotational period had changed since it was first measured in 1980 by Voyager 1, and it was now 6 minutes longer. This, however, does not indicate a change in the overall spin of the planet, but is thought to be due to movement of the source of the radio emissions to a different latitude, at which the rotation rate is different.\\r\\nOn July 1, 2004, the spacecraft flew through the gap between the F and G rings and achieved orbit, after a seven-year voyage.[67] It was the first spacecraft to ever orbit Saturn.\\r\\nThe Saturn Orbital Insertion (SOI) maneuver performed by Cassini was complex, requiring the craft to orient its High-Gain Antenna away from Earth and along its flight path, to shield its instruments from particles in Saturn's rings. Once the craft crossed the ring plane, it had to rotate again to point its engine along its flight path, and then the engine fired to decelerate the craft by 622 meters/s to allow Saturn to capture it.[68] Cassini was captured by Saturn's gravity at around 8:54?pm Pacific Daylight Time on June 30, 2004. During the maneuver Cassini passed within 20,000?km (12,000?mi) of Saturn's cloud tops.\\r\\nWhen Cassini was in Saturnian orbit, departure from the Saturn system was evaluated in 2008 during end of mission planning.[69][clarification needed]\\r\\nCassini had its first flyby of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, on July 2, 2004, a day after orbit insertion, when it approached to within 339,000?km (211,000?mi) of Titan. Images taken through special filters (able to see through the moon's global haze) showed south polar clouds thought to be composed of methane and surface features with widely differing brightness. On October 27, 2004, the spacecraft executed the first of the 45 planned close flybys of Titan when it passed a mere 1,200 kilometers above the moon. Almost four gigabits of data were collected and transmitted to Earth, including the first radar images of the moon's haze-enshrouded surface. It revealed the surface of Titan (at least the area covered by radar) to be relatively level, with topography reaching no more than about 50 meters in altitude. The flyby provided a remarkable increase in imaging resolution over previous coverage. Images with up to 100 times better resolution were taken and are typical of resolutions planned for subsequent Titan flybys. Cassini collected pictures of Titan and the lakes of methane were similar to the lakes of Earth.\\r\\nCassini released the Huygens probe on December 25, 2004, by means of a spring and spiral rails intended to rotate the probe for greater stability. It entered the atmosphere of Titan on January 14, 2005, and after a two-and-a-half-hour descent landed on solid ground.[5] Although Cassini successfully relayed 350 of the pictures that it received from Huygens of its descent and landing site, a software error failed to turn on one of the Cassini receivers and caused the loss of another 350 pictures. While landing, for caution, NASA loaded Huygens with 3 parachutes.[70]\\r\\nDuring the first two close flybys of the moon Enceladus in 2005, Cassini discovered a deflection in the local magnetic field that is characteristic for the existence of a thin but significant atmosphere. Other measurements obtained at that time point to ionized water vapor as its main constituent. Cassini also observed water ice geysers erupting from the south pole of Enceladus, which gives more credibility to the idea that Enceladus is supplying the particles of Saturn's E ring. Mission scientists began to suspect that there may be pockets of liquid water near the surface of the moon that fuel the eruptions.[71]\\r\\nOn March 12, 2008, Cassini made a close fly-by of Enceladus, passing within 50?km of the moon's surface.[72] The spacecraft passed through the plumes extending from its southern geysers, detecting water, carbon dioxide and various hydrocarbons with its mass spectrometer, while also mapping surface features that are at much higher temperature than their surroundings with the infrared spectrometer.[73] Cassini was unable to collect data with its cosmic dust analyzer due to an unknown software malfunction.\\r\\nOn November 21, 2009, Cassini made its eighth flyby of Enceladus,[74] this time with a different geometry, approaching within 1,600 kilometers (990?mi) of the surface. The Composite Infrared Spectrograph (CIRS) instrument produced a map of thermal emissions from the Baghdad Sulcus 'tiger stripe'. The data returned helped create a detailed and high resolution mosaic image of the southern part of the moon's Saturn-facing hemisphere.\\r\\nOn April 3, 2014, nearly ten years after Cassini entered Saturn's orbit, NASA reported evidence of a large salty internal ocean of liquid water in Enceladus. The presence of an internal salty ocean in contact with the moon's rocky core, places Enceladus \\"among the most likely places in the Solar System to host alien microbial life\\".[75][76][77] On June 30, 2014, NASA celebrated ten years of Cassini exploring Saturn and its moons, highlighting the discovery of water activity on Enceladus among other findings.[78]\\r\\nIn September 2015, NASA announced that gravitational and imaging data from Cassini were used to analyze the librations of Enceladus' orbit and determined that the moon's surface is not rigidly joined to its core, concluding that the underground ocean must therefore be global in extent.[79]\\r\\nOn October 28, 2015, Cassini performed a close flyby of Enceladus, coming within 49?km (30?mi) of the surface, and passing through the icy plume above the south pole.[80]\\r\\nIn May 2005, Cassini began a series of radio occultation experiments, to measure the size-distribution of particles in Saturn's rings, and measure the atmosphere of Saturn itself. For over four months, the craft completed orbits designed for this purpose. During these experiments, it flew behind the ring plane of Saturn, as seen from Earth, and transmitted radio waves through the particles. The radio signals received on Earth were analyzed, for frequency, phase, and power shift of the signal to determine the structure of the rings.\\r\\nIn images captured September 5, 2005, Cassini detected spokes in Saturn's rings,[81] previously seen only by the visual observer Stephen James O'Meara in 1977 and then confirmed by the Voyager space probes in the early 1980s.[82][83][full citation needed]\\r\\nRadar images obtained on July 21, 2006 appear to show lakes of liquid hydrocarbon (such as methane and ethane) in Titan's northern latitudes. This is the first discovery of currently existing lakes anywhere besides on Earth. The lakes range in size from one to one-hundred kilometers across.[84]\\r\\nOn March 13, 2007, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced that it had found strong evidence of seas of methane and ethane in the northern hemisphere of Titan. At least one of these is larger than any of the Great Lakes in North America.[85]\\r\\nIn November 2006, scientists discovered a storm at the south pole of Saturn with a distinct eyewall. This is characteristic of a hurricane on Earth and had never been seen on another planet before. Unlike a terrestrial hurricane, the storm appears to be stationary at the pole. The storm is 8,000 kilometers (5,000?mi) across, and 70 kilometers (43?mi) high, with winds blowing at 560 kilometers per hour (350?mph).[86]\\r\\nOn September 10, 2007, Cassini completed its flyby of the strange, two-toned, walnut-shaped moon, Iapetus. Images were taken from 1,000 miles (1,600?km) above the surface. As it was sending the images back to Earth, it was hit by a cosmic ray that forced it to temporarily enter safe mode. All of the data from the flyby were recovered.[87]\\r\\nOn April 15, 2008, Cassini received funding for a 27-month extended mission. It consisted of 60 more orbits of Saturn, with 21 more close Titan flybys, seven of Enceladus, six of Mimas, eight of Tethys, and one targeted flyby each of Dione, Rhea, and Helene.[88] The extended mission began on July 1, 2008, and was renamed the Cassini Equinox Mission as the mission coincided with Saturn's equinox.[89]\\r\\nA proposal was submitted to NASA for a second mission extension (September 2010 ÿ May 2017), provisionally named the extended-extended mission or XXM.[90] This ($60M pa) was approved in February 2010 and renamed the Cassini Solstice Mission.[91] It included Cassini orbiting Saturn 155 more times, conducting 54 additional flybys of Titan and 11 more of Enceladus.\\r\\nOn October 25, 2012, Cassini witnessed the aftermath of the massive Great White Spot storm that recurs roughly every 30 years on Saturn.[92] Data from the composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS) instrument indicated a powerful discharge from the storm that caused a temperature spike in the stratosphere of Saturn 83?K (83?C; 149?F) above normal. Simultaneously, a huge increase in ethylene gas was detected by NASA researchers at Goddard Research Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Ethylene is a colorless gas that is highly uncommon on Saturn and is produced both naturally and through man-made sources on Earth. The storm that produced this discharge was first observed by the spacecraft on December 5, 2010 in Saturn's northern hemisphere. The storm is the first of its kind to be observed by a spacecraft in orbit around Saturn as well as the first to be observed at thermal infrared wavelengths, allowing scientists to observe the temperature of Saturn's atmosphere and track phenomena that are invisible to the naked eye. The spike of ethylene gas that was produced by the storm reached levels that were 100 times more than those thought possible for Saturn. Scientists have also determined that the storm witnessed was the largest, hottest stratospheric vortex ever detected in the Solar System, initially being larger than Jupiter's Great Red Spot.\\r\\nOn December 21, 2012, Cassini observed a transit of Venus across the Sun.[93] The VIMS instrument analyzed sunlight passing though the Venusian atmosphere.[93] VIMS previously observed the transit of exoplanet HD 189733 b.[93]\\r\\nOn July 19, 2013, the probe was pointed towards Earth to capture an image of the Earth and the Moon, as part of a natural light, multi-image portrait of the entire Saturn system. The event was unique as it was the first time NASA informed the public that a long-distance photo was being taken in advance.[94][95] The imaging team said they wanted people to smile and wave to the skies, with Cassini scientist, Carolyn Porco, describing the moment as a chance to \\"celebrate life on the Pale Blue Dot\\".[96]\\r\\nOn February 10, 2015, the Cassini spacecraft visited Rhea more closely, coming within 47,000?km (29,000?mi).[97] The spacecraft observed the moon with its cameras producing some of the highest resolution color images yet of Rhea.[98]\\r\\nCassini performed its latest flyby of Saturn's moon Hyperion on May 31, 2015, at a distance of about 34,000?km (21,000?mi).[99]\\r\\nCassini performed its last flyby of Saturn's moon Dione on August 17, 2015, at a distance of about 475?km (295?mi). A previous flyby was performed on June 16.[100]\\r\\nBetween 2012 and 2016, the hexagon changed from a mostly blue color to more of a golden color.[101] One theory for this is that sunlight is creating haze as the pole is exposed to sunlight due to the change in season.[101] It was previously noted that there was less blue color overall on Saturn between 2004 and 2008.[102]\\r\\nCassini's end involved a series of close Saturn passes, approaching within the rings, then an entry into Saturn's atmosphere on September 15, 2017, to destroy the spacecraft.[5][10][69] This method was chosen because it is imperative to ensure protection and prevent biological contamination to any of the moons of Saturn thought to offer potential habitability.[103]\\r\\nIn 2008 a number of options were evaluated to achieve this goal, each with varying funding, scientific, and technical challenges.[104] A short period Saturn impact for an end of mission was rated \\"excellent\\" with the reasons \\"D-ring option satisfies unachieved AO goals; cheap and easily achievable\\" while collision with an icy moon was rated \\"good\\" for being \\"cheap and achievable anywhere/time\\".[104]\\r\\nOn November 29, 2016, the spacecraft performed a Titan flyby that took it to the gateway of F-ring orbits: This was the start of the Grand Finale phase culminating in its impact with the planet.[105][106] A final Titan flyby on April 22, 2017, changed the orbit again to fly through the gap between Saturn and its inner ring days later on April 26. Cassini passed about 3,100?km (1,900?mi) above Saturn's cloud layer and 320?km (200?mi) from the visible edge of the inner ring; it successfully took images of Saturn's atmosphere and began returning data the next day.[107] After a further 22 orbits through the gap, the mission was ended with a dive into Saturn's atmosphere on September 15; signal was lost at 7:55:46 AM EDT on September 15, 2017, just 30 seconds later than predicted. It is estimated that the spacecraft burned up about 45 seconds after the last transmission.\\r\\nThe spacecraft operation was organized around a series of missions.[109] Each is structured according to a certain amount of funding, goals, etc.[109] At least 260 scientists from 17 countries have worked on the CassiniÿHuygens mission; in addition thousands of people overall worked to design, manufacture, and launch the mission.[110]\\r\\nOfficial websites\\r\\nMedia and telecommunications","input":"When did the cassini spacecraft arrived at saturn?"},{"output":"males","context":"formerly Panthera leo massaica\\r\\nThe Tsavo lion (Panthera leo melanochaita) is a lion population in the Tsavo East National Park, Kenya.[1]\\r\\nTwo Tsavo males have been known as man-eaters after an incident during the building of the Uganda Railway in the late 19th century. Their skulls and skins are part of the zoological collection of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally, ten lion subspecies were recognised in Africa.[4] In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group assigned the lion populations in Asia and West, Central and North Africa to Panthera leo leo, and the lion populations in Southern and East Africa to Panthera leo melanochaita.[5]\\r\\nTsavo lions are more closely related to Transvaal lions in South Africa than to East African lions in the Aberdare Range and to Uganda lions.[1]\\r\\nAs of 2006, there were an estimated 675 lions in the Tsavo area, out of the 2,000 total in Kenya. Lions and their prey are officially protected in Tsavo, but they are regularly killed by local people, with over 100 known lion killings between 2001 and 2006.[6]\\r\\nMales of the Tsavo prides are usually larger than other male lions, and actively participate in hunting. Their prides are unique in that they frequently have only a single male lion, whereas most lion prides have two to eight (usually related) males. Tsavo prides also tend to be larger overall, with an average of seven to eight adult females in each group.[7]\\r\\nTsavo male lions generally do not have a mane, though colouration and thickness may vary. There are several hypotheses as to why this is. One is that mane development is closely tied to climate because its presence significantly reduces heat loss.[8] An alternative explanation is that manelessness is an adaptation to the thorny vegetation of the Tsavo area in which a mane might hinder hunting. Tsavo males may have heightened levels of testosterone, which could explain both the Tsavo lion's manelessness and its reputation for aggression.[7] The weak or absent mane of Tsavo lions is a feature, which was characteristic also for the extinct lions of ancient Egypt and Nubia. Adult lion males in Egyptian art are usually depicted without a mane, but with a ruff around the neck.[9]\\r\\nTwo lions are known as the Tsavo Man-Eaters who attacked workers on the Kenya-Uganda Railway in 1898. The total number of people killed is unclear, but allegedly 135 people fell victim to these lions in less than a year before Colonel John Patterson killed them.[10]","input":"Where the lions of tsavo male or female?"},{"output":"August 2, 2018","context":"Marvel's Cloak & Dagger, or simply Cloak & Dagger, is an American cable television series created for Freeform by Joe Pokaski, based on the Marvel Comics characters of the same name. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise. The series is produced by ABC Signature Studios, Marvel Television, and Wandering Rocks Productions, with Pokaski serving as showrunner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series stars Olivia Holt and Aubrey Joseph as Tandy Bowen / Dagger and Tyrone Johnson / Cloak, two teenagers with superpowers who form a romantic relationship. A television series featuring the pair had begun development at ABC Family in July 2011. The channel, renamed Freeform, ordered Cloak & Dagger to series in April 2016, and Pokaski had joined as showrunner by that August. Holt and Joseph were cast in January 2017, with Gloria Reuben, Andrea Roth, J. D. Evermore, Miles Mussenden, Carl Lundstedt, Emma Lahana, and Jaime Zevallos also starring in the series. Filming for the series takes place in New Orleans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first season aired from June 7 to August 2, 2018 and was met with positive reviews. Freeform renewed the series for a second season in July 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn New Orleans, teenagers Tandy Bowen and Tyrone Johnson come from different backgrounds and have acquired superpowers after a life-changing event that revolved around the collapse of the Roxxon Gulf Platform. As their relationship unfolds, they soon realize that their powers work better when they are together, \\"but their feelings for each other make their already complicated world even more challenging.\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nStan Lee has a cameo appearance as an on-set painting.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt San Diego Comic-Con International 2011, head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb announced the series Cloak & Dagger was in development at ABC Family. The series, which would be set in post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, would follow Cloak and Dagger as the two \\"find each other and realize that their powers both complement and complicate their lives.\\"[28] Around this time, Loeb had a meeting with ABC Family, who recommended Joe Pokaski to Loeb as a potential writer to work with Marvel Television, based on a script for another series the channel had recently received from Pokaski. Loeb reached out to Pokaski about working with Marvel, who was interested in writing Cloak and Dagger since \\"theres something that felt so right about them for the television format\\", and wrote the script. Pokaski was attracted to Cloak and Dagger as a television series, because the duo are the only people who understand each others situations, compared to other coming-of-age teenage television series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Smallville where the main characters have no one who can relate to them.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2016, the series received a straight-to-series order for Freeform, the new name of ABC Family, from ABC Signature Studios and Marvel Television.[1] By August 2016, Pokaski had signed on to the series as showrunner and executive producer.[30][31][32] Pokaski noted his script had \\"sat in a drawer for five years\\", before Freeform executive Karey Burke found it and \\"took a chance on it\\".[29] Loeb, Jim Chory,[33][32] Alan Fine, Stan Lee, Joe Quesada, and Karim Zreik also serve as executive producers, while Jenny Klein produces the series.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 20, 2018, Freeform renewed the series for a 10-episode second season.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nShowrunner Joe Pokaski on having diversity in the series' writers and the issues the series can explore.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen announcing the series, Freeform called it their \\"first venture into the Marvel Cinematic Universe\\", and described it as a \\"superhero love story\\", a premise that Variety called \\"a seamless fit for Freeform\\" given the channel's target audience of \\"Becomers\\" (the 14ÿ34 age demographic).[1][36] Addressing this, Loeb said, \\"It's a love story that happens to have characters that have always traditionally been in that age group. It's not like we took something and made it into a [young adult fiction (YA)]. It speaks to a YA audience and is a YA property. Would I do Punisher on Freeform? I don't think that's going to connect the same way.\\"[37] Pokaski was pleased with the diversity of the writers for the first season, with a majority of black writers and many female writers.[38] The majority of the writers from the first season returned for the second.The second season would explore the themes of women's rights and issues through Mina Hess, while \\"continuing to drive the conversation forward about race in America\\".[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nPokaski spoke about the differences in Cloak and Dagger's origin story from the comics, saying, \\"I think the original [comic] stories were fantastic, but for the time, while they were a little progressive, they were a little bit sexist and racist once you got into it, for now. What we tried to do was deconstruct it and make it about Tandy and Tyrone, understand who they were.\\"[39] Since the original comics \\"are a little dated\\", Pokaski and the writers could to make adjustments accordingly as Cloak and Dagger do not have an established comics mythology, making sure \\"we were telling the right story for now\\".[29] He also felt Loeb's idea of having the duo live in New Orleans, opposed to New York City as in the comics, was a \\"great idea\\".[39] Since Marvel was also developing The Defenders at the same time, moving to the New Orleans setting \\"came up pretty early\\", since Pokaski felt New York City of the Marvel Cinematic Universe had enough superheroes. When looking for alternate locations, and considering places with filming tax incentives, New Orleans \\"felt so right for Tandy and Tyrone. It felt gothic, it felt a little bit dark, it felt like a place of light and shadow. The more we learned about the city and about its history and about voudon or the Mardi Gras Indians, it felt like it was the only place for Tandy and Tyrone to start.\\"[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nPokaski did not want to rush the romantic relationship between the duo in the first season, and hoped the series would last long enough to allow for an interesting path to their relationship.[4] Pokaski has an intent to create 100 episodes for the series, with \\"a definitive plan for five season\\" created.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2017, it was announced that Olivia Holt and Aubrey Joseph had been cast as Tandy Bowen / Dagger and Tyrone Johnson / Cloak, respectively.[3] Gina Prince-Bythewood, the director of the first episode, called the casting process \\"really, really tough it was three days before we were supposed to leave [to begin filming] and we didn't find [actors for Tandy and Tyrone]. People started getting willing to settle and the people that were on the table were 27, 28. They felt grown and it didn't feel right for the show. Then Aubrey and Olivia walked in the door, and they had such great chops individually\\".[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following month, Andrea Roth was cast as Melissa Bowen, Tandy's mother;[6] Gloria Reuben and Miles Mussenden were cast as Tyrone's parents, Adina and Otis Johnson;[6][7] and Carl Lundstedt and J. D. Evermore were cast as Liam Walsh and Connors, respectively.[6][8] Emma Lahana and Jaime Zevallos also star as Brigid O'Reilly and Delgado.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilming for the series takes place in New Orleans,[40][41] with the first season using the working title Shadows.[42] The first season features many hand-held camera shots that established the \\"look and feel\\" of the series, in part because Pokaski \\"didnt want to wait for a dolly track to be laid\\".[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nMark Isham announced in May 2017 that he would compose the music for the series.[43] Multiple songs are featured throughout the first season,[44] some of which were collected and released on a digital soundtrack album on June 8, 2018, by Marvel Music and Hollywood Records.[45][46] An album featuring Isham's score was released digitally on July 6.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nFreeform executive Karey Burke said in April 2017 that the series is \\"not particularly connected\\" to New Warriors, which was slated to air on Freeform at the time, given \\"their tones are so wildly different\\", adding, \\"There are many degrees of separation with where they fall in the Marvel universe. But anything is possible with Marvel.\\"[48] In July, Loeb said there were no plans to crossover, nor to crossover across networks with the similarly themed Marvel's Runaways on Hulu. He added that Marvel wanted the series to find its footing before further connecting with other elements of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying \\"You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... things that are happening in L.A. [where Runaways is set] are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans... It's being aware of it and trying to find a way for it to be able to discuss in a way that makes sense.\\"[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nAhead of the series premiere, considering the larger events of the MCU at that point, Pokaski said he was \\"not allowed to talk about\\" how the series would connect to the events of Avengers: Infinity War but stated \\"Weve had some exciting conversations about how we could artfully cross Tandy and Tyrone over [to other Marvel properties]. The beauty of these two is that they can show up anywhere [and it makes sense].[4] After the first season finale, Pokaski expanded, saying he would \\"love\\" to have Tandy and Tyrone appear in the MCU films \\"as utility players the way they are in comics\\", but conceded \\"there are a lot of legal hurdles and corporate barriers to doing that\\". Regarding a crossover with the Runaways, Pokaski noted \\"there's hopefully there's some karma we can fulfill there\\" since the duo in the comics appear early in the Runaways comic series.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nCloak & Dagger airs in the United States on Freeform and on ABC Spark in Canada,[50][51] while Amazon Video airs the series in the United Kingdom and select additional European countries.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nCloak & Dagger had the best series launch on Freeform in two years and Freeforms most-watched drama since \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\", the series finale of Pretty Little Liars in June 2017. After three days, \\"First Light\\" had 1.64 million total viewers, which was a 78% increase from its initial viewers, the largest three-day lift for any Freeform debut. \\"First Light\\" also had the biggest digital debut ever for the network, with 716,000 starts. The premiere drew 7.3 million views across linear and digital platforms and was Thursdays most-social scripted series with 112,000 engagements across Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Tumblr.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first season, the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 90% approval rating with an average rating of 7.77/10 based on 41 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Cloak & Dagger blends soapy drama with superhero grit to create an exciting, surprisingly thoughtful addition to the genre  even if it falls prey to a certain amount of narrative bloat.\\"[53] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the announcement of the series, Riesman felt one of the show's potential strengths was the fact that Marvel had a unique opportunity to tell a story \\"without needing to appeal to any kind of rabid fanbase or honor any iconic stories,\\" because the characters have neither \\"any famous archnemeses,\\" nor \\"a widely read graphic novel\\" that fans would be expecting to see. He concluded saying, \\"Cloak & Dagger could be something unique and potentially lovely: an attempt to build a new bit of filmed superhero iconography (mostly) from the ground up. Theres so much to mine in this genre. It deals metaphorically with the burdens, risks, and liberations of power  and it has the storytelling freedoms offered by high-concept science fiction, fantasy, and magical realism.\\"[56] Pokaski would later tell Riesman in August 2018 that he sent Karey Burke and other executives on the series Riseman's article as encouragement for the direction they were planning to take the series and to know what they released about the series at the time did not sound \\"like we were blowing smoke\\".[29]","input":"When does cloak and dagger episode 10 air?"},{"output":"one to two weeks","context":"Orthodontic separators (commonly known as spacers) are rubber bands or metal appliances used in orthodontics. Spacers are placed between the molars at the second orthodontic appointment, before molar bands  are applied.[1] Spacers are either circular rubber bands about a centimeter in diameter placed between top and bottom molars;[citation needed] there may be 1-12 spacers applied or small metal spring clips (spring separators) that push the molars apart. The spacers stay between the teeth for one to two weeks and move the teeth apart slowly until they are far apart enough so that orthodontists can fit a tooth brace or molar band in between them or fit an expander with rubber rings.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpacers are usually used to put spaces in between teeth before braces are established. It can be agitating or painful, but patients are often warned not to pick at them or they will fall out. They are usually rubber, but sometimes they can be metal. They can be used when a patient's teeth are too close together. Although they are sometimes very painful, they are usually only in place for one to two weeks. Spacers can also cause toothache and gum pain because of the constant pressure against the patient's teeth. The gaps that the spacers create are necessary to apply certain appliances or braces. There are two common types of expanders used after the spaces have been made. One, very primitive, model is a metal bar that has a key used to tighten. Secondly, and more contemporary, there is an expander that is two \\"L\\" shaped metal rods, attached at the molars. Brackets fit against the edges. It is secured with a spring in the middle that applies pressure.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are various reactions patients experience to having spacers placed between their teeth. If the patient has a relatively small amount of space between their molars (or none at all), then the spacer may irritate the nerves in the gum of the mouth, causing constant pain. In some cases the spacer digs into the gums, causing bleeding and swelling; and would be more uncomfortable than the actual braces. An orthodontist may advise the patient to drink cold drinks or to eat ice cream, producing a similar, although less efficient and short-lasting effect. Spacers are usually painful, although pain relievers can alleviate the pain if needed. Depending on the placement of the patient's teeth, spacers may not hurt when first applied, then start to hurt after some time, or they may immediately start to hurt. Depending on the type, spacers may cause pain while chewing, making certain foods (usually those that are tough or crispy) difficult to eat. Some people may also experience a sensation similar to having losing their milk teeth or like having food stick between their teeth. The patient may feel the need to try to remove the spacer but that isn't advised as it makes the next step in your braces harder and more painful. Brushing will not cause spacers to be displaced and regular, if not more, brushing while spacers are in place is encouraged.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe application process of spacers usually involves stringing floss through the rubber band and placing the spacer between the teeth. Some spacers are small metal spring clips that squeeze the teeth apart. There is some pressure throughout the process and some soreness after, but overall, the spacer application process is quite painless, although the patient may immediately start to feel pain from the pressure exerted on the teeth. Sometimes special orthodontic tools are used to stretch open the rubber bands, depending on how crowded the teeth are. If the jaw is especially crowded, the spacers may cause intense constant pain due to the teeth moving closer together. This pain begins a while after placement and usually lasts for several days.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpacers are worn until the orthodontist removes them or they are removed accidentally. Spacers may also fall out on their own without being removed by the patient by picking or eating sticky foods. Sometimes, a dentist may use a spacer that is similar to a metal spacer (see below), but is removable and in some cases it may have a key or string used to adjust the tightness[citation needed]. The spacers are taken out about a week before placing the braces.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMetal spacers are small and metal and are placed around the tooth. These are most commonly used while braces are already on another set of teeth. These are often worn longer than rubber bands, and tend to be more painful. These are not used as often as the rubber bands. They also may tear into the gums.","input":"How long do spacers have to stay in?"},{"output":"The dermis","context":"The dermis or corium is a layer of skin between the epidermis (with which it makes up the cutis) and subcutaneous tissues, that primarily consists of dense irregular connective tissue and cushions the body from stress and strain. It is divided into two layers, the superficial area adjacent to the epidermis called the papillary region and a deep thicker area known as the reticular dermis.[1] The dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis through a basement membrane. Structural components of the dermis are collagen, elastic fibers, and extrafibrillar matrix.[2] It also contains mechanoreceptors that provide the sense of touch and thermoreceptors that provide the sense of heat. In addition, hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, apocrine glands, lymphatic vessels and blood vessels are present in the dermis. Those blood vessels provide nourishment and waste removal for both dermal and epidermal cells.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dermis is composed of three major types of cells:[3] fibroblasts, macrophages, and adipocytes.\\r\\nApart from these cells, the dermis is also composed of matrix components such as collagen (which provides strength), elastin (which provides elasticity), and extrafibrillar matrix, an extracellular gel-like substance primarily composed of glycosaminoglycans (most notably hyaluronan), proteoglycans, and glycoproteins.[3]\\r\\nThe papillary dermis is the uppermost layer of the dermis. It intertwines with the rete ridges of the epidermis and is composed of fine and loosely arranged collagen fibers.[2]\\r\\nThe papillary region is composed of loose areolar connective tissue. This is named for its fingerlike projections called papillae, that extend toward the epidermis and contain either terminal networks of blood capillaries or tactile Meissner's corpuscles.[4]\\r\\nThe reticular dermis is the lower layer of the dermis, found under the papillary dermis, composed of dense irregular connective tissue featuring densely packed collagen fibers. It is the primary location of dermal elastic fibers.[2]\\r\\nThe reticular region is usually much thicker than the overlying papillary dermis. It receives its name from the dense concentration of collagenous, elastic, and reticular fibers that weave throughout it. These protein fibers give the dermis its properties of strength, extensibility, and elasticity. Within the reticular region are the roots of the hair, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, receptors, nails, and blood vessels. The orientation of collagen fibers within the reticular dermis creates lines of tension called Langer's lines, which are of some relevance in surgery and wound healing.[5]\\r\\nThe dermal papillae (DP) (singular papilla, diminutive of Latin papula, 'pimple') are small, nipple-like extensions (or interdigitations) of the dermis into the epidermis. At the surface of the skin in hands and feet, they appear as epidermal or papillary ridges (colloquially known as fingerprints).\\r\\nBlood vessels in the dermal papillae nourish all hair follicles and bring nutrients and oxygen to the lower layers of epidermal cells. The pattern of ridges they produce in hands and feet are partly genetically determined features that develop before birth. They remain substantially unaltered (except in size) throughout life, and therefore determine the patterns of fingerprints, making them useful in certain functions of personal identification. [6]\\r\\nThe dermal papillae are part of the uppermost layer of the dermis, the papillary dermis, and the ridges they form greatly increase the surface area between the dermis and epidermis. Because the main function of the dermis is to support the epidermis, this greatly increases the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between these two layers. Additionally, the increase in surface area prevents the dermal and epidermal layers from separating from each other by strengthening the junction between them. With age, the papillae tend to flatten and sometimes increase in number. [7]\\r\\nDermal papillae also play a pivotal role in hair formation, growth and cycling. [8]\\r\\nIn mucous membranes, the equivalent structures to dermal papillae are generally termed \\"connective tissue papillae\\", which interdigitate with the rete pegs of the superficial epithelium.","input":"Are sebaceous glands in the dermis or epidermis?"},{"output":"Ivan Cleary","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Zealand Warriors are a professional rugby league football club based in Auckland, New Zealand that compete in the National Rugby League (NRL) premiership and are the League's only team from outside Australia. They were formerly known as the Auckland Warriors, and are officially known as the Vodafone Warriors for sponsorship reasons.[2] The Warriors are coached by Stephen Kearney and captained by Roger Tuivasa-Sheck. They are based at Mt Smart Stadium in the Auckland suburb of Penrose.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 1995 season the newly-formed Auckland Warriors became the first club from outside Australia to be admitted to the Australian Rugby League's premiership when it expanded from 16 to 20 teams. As a result of the Super League war in the mid-1990s, Auckland left the ARL to compete in the Super League competition of 1997, before joining the re-unified NRL the following year. They re-branded themselves the New Zealand Warriors in 2001. Over 21 seasons the Warriors have claimed one minor premiership (in 2002), reached two grand finals (2002 and 2011), reached the play-offs seven times, and provided the majority of the New Zealand national team's players.\\r\\n\\r\\nRugby league was largely centred around Auckland ever since the New Zealand Rugby League was founded in 1909. Auckland produced the bulk of the international squad for many years, and most of these players headed to either Australia or Great Britain to play.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Auckland representative side was consistently providing top opposition to touring teams. An Auckland team was admitted into the mid-week ARL Amco Cup competition in 1978. In their first year they made the semi-finals, and were defeated by the overall competition winners, Eastern Suburbs. They remained into the competition until the early 1980s. In 1987, an Auckland side toured Great Britain and claimed wins over powerhouse clubs Leeds and Wigan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, serious investigation into an Auckland team entering the New South Wales Rugby League premiership commenced, encouraged mainly by the Mt Albert club. On 17 May 1992, the announcement stating an Auckland-based team's entry into the Australian Rugby League competition, the Winfield Cup in 1995, was made. This followed very good turnouts to a number of NSWRL club games played in Auckland. The new team was to be called the Auckland Warriors and run by the Auckland Rugby League organisation. The original colours selected were blue, white, red and green. Blue and white are recognised as the colours of Auckland, while red and green were the colours of the Warriors' original sponsor, DB Bitter. The original logo was designed by Francis Allan, of Colenso.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coach of the new team would be former Parramatta and Wigan coach John Monie. A number of senior players were signed, such as Greg Alexander and Andy Platt. Captain Dean Bell was a high-performing signing. Former Rugby union players such as John Kirwan and Marc Ellis were brought in, in later years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors' first year in the Australian Rugby League was 1995. Their debut match was against the Brisbane Broncos on 10 March 1995 in front of 30,000 people at a newly refurbished Mt Smart Stadium. The Warriors led 22ÿ10 at one point in the second half of the match, however the Broncos defeated the new club 25ÿ22.\\r\\n\\r\\nA home crowd attendance record of 32,174 was set at Ericsson Stadium in Round 6 of the 1995 ARL season, a record that was not topped until Round 1 of the 2011 NRL season.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors were deducted two competition points for an interchange error. In a match against Western Suburbs, the Warriors used five interchange players instead of the allowed four. The Warriors won the match comfortably, 46ÿ12. This error had disastrous consequences for the club, as they ultimately missed the finals by two competition points. The season saw the debut of future star, Stacey Jones, who scored a try on debut in a 40ÿ4 rout of Parramatta in Sydney. The biggest issue with the season was the lack of consistency, that is evident with the Warriors even today, despite a six match winning streak late in the season. It was observed that when the Warriors were not winning by 20 points they were losing by 20 points.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Rugby League season 1996 could have been regarded as a better one for the Warriors. The Warriors found themselves siding with the Super League during the Super League War when the New Zealand Rugby League signed up to the rebel competition. They claimed their first 'victory' over the Broncos in round one of the competition that year, after all Super League clubs agreed to boycott the first round of the competition in protest. The Warriors won the two points when they travelled to Brisbane with a squad of players that were unsigned to Super League, forcing the Broncos to forfeit the match.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith four rounds remaining the Warriors were in sixth place in the competition, seemingly headed for a finals berth. They proceeded to lose all four matches to tumble out of the finals. The only positives were that young New Zealand talents Stacey Jones and Joe Vagana had superb seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors spent 1997 in the breakaway Super League Telstra Cup competition. Despite the reduced number of teams, they failed to make an impression on the competition. Monie was replaced by Frank Endacott as coach midway through the 1997 season. The only positive was the team's performance in the World Club Challenge. The Warriors hammered United Kingdom powerhouses Wigan and St Helens, and comfortably handled Warrington. The Warriors were knocked out in the Semi Finals by eventual winners Brisbane, going down 16ÿ22.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first season of the reformed competition was a year that saw few highlights for the club. It was readily apparent that the club needed a new approach and attitude. Fortunately for them, they were in a better position than the other two clubs that joined the competition in 1995.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer Kiwi Mark Graham took over as coach in 1999. The club was sold off to a consortium that included ex-Kiwi coach Graham Lowe and the Tainui tribe. The club again disappointed on field, but a mid season ultimatum saw a strong finish to the season, with the side winning five of their last six games. The signs appeared promising for the new millennium.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn National Rugby League season 2000 the Warriors could only finish second last. This season included the Warriors' largest ever loss in their history to date, 54ÿ0 to the Dragons in Wollongong. Alarmingly, the problems off-field overshadowed the on-field problems. The majority shareholders were under intense financial pressure, and the club's future was looking bleak at best. The key assets of the club were purchased by business tycoon Eric Watson. This did not include player contracts, and many players were released and had to fight to get the money they had been promised. Ultimately only 10 players from the 2000 season were retained.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club was re-branded as the New Zealand Warriors, with new colours of black and grey ÿ resembling the national sporting colours. New coach Daniel Anderson and CEO Mick Watson focused on signing unknown New Zealand talent. There were only six Australians in the 2001 squad, and only three foundation players ÿ Monty Betham, Stacey Jones and Logan Swann.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a season where the re-branded New Zealand Warriors were tipped to finish in second-last place behind the North Queensland Cowboys, the team surprised all, qualifying for their first ever finals appearance in the National Rugby League season 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors were involved in Round 8 in one of the biggest near-comebacks in the history of the NRL. Down 24ÿ8 to the Bulldogs with under six minutes remaining, the Warriors rattled off three tries in as many sets, only failing to win the match as ironically Stacey Jones missed his easiest kick of the night in the final minute.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a mid season struggle, the Warriors upset the runaway minor premiers Parramatta 29ÿ18 at home, in what was a highlight match.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, with their season on the line, the team won four matches in a row, starting with impressive 34ÿ8, 30ÿ0, and 14ÿ8 home victories over fellow finals-bound teams the Bulldogs, Sharks and Roosters. The Warriors also scored 24 unanswered points in the final quarter to beat the Panthers 48ÿ32. Their first finals appearance was sealed with a bruising 24ÿ24 draw with the Storm at Colonial Stadium (now Etihad Stadium), but the effects of this bruising match was seen a week later, as the Warriors were beaten by 30ÿ18 at home by the Cowboys, a win that saw the North Queenslanders avoiding the wooden spoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a hiding to nothing heading into their first ever finals appearance, they were hammered by the Minor Premiers, the Parramatta Eels 56ÿ12. The loss was at the time the largest in finals series history, but at last things seemed to be going in the right direction at the Warriors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors reached their zenith to date in the National Rugby League season 2002. They won the Minor Premiership, finishing in first place at the conclusion of the regular season after the Bulldogs lost 37 competition points late in the season due to severe salary cap breaches. The club played what stands as the first finals match to have been held outside Australia at Mt Smart Stadium in the first week of the Finals Series. The Warriors would defeat their bogey side Canberra 36ÿ20 after surviving an early scare.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Preliminary Final against the Sharks at Telstra Stadium the Warriors' sponsors, such as Vodafone New Zealand and Eric Watson, purchased 15,000 tickets and gave them away for free to anyone with a New Zealand passport. Reportedly, in the 45,000 crowd there were more Warriors supporters than Sharks supporters ÿ astonishing considering the Sharks are a Sydney-based club. The Warriors went on to win 16ÿ10 with John Carlaw scoring a famous try after latching onto a pinpoint Stacey Jones grubber-kick.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Final against the Sydney Roosters was a tight match for the first hour. The Warriors trailed 2ÿ6 at half time, but took a lead just after halftime when Jones scored a great grand final try ÿ as he left defenders sprawling in his wake on a 40-metre run to the try line. The Roosters ran away with the match in the final 20 minutes after captain Brad Fittler was involved in a head clash with Warriors prop Richard Villasanti. The final score was an unflattering 8ÿ30.\\r\\n\\r\\n2003 was another quite successful year for the Warriors.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter blowing an early 16ÿ0 lead to lose 26ÿ36 to the Newcastle Knights in Round 1, the Warriors embarked on a five-match winning streak to announce themselves as contenders for the season. However, the Warriors then struggled through the middle-stages of the season, squandering a 26ÿ12 lead with eight minutes remaining to lose to the Parramatta Eels dramatically 28ÿ26 at Parramatta Stadium. There was also an insipid 10ÿ30 loss in Townsville to the North Queensland. They played their first ever extra time match, defeating South Sydney 31ÿ30, recovering from a 6ÿ24 deficit.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the back of inspired play by prop Richard Villasanti, the Warriors secured their playoff spot, ultimately finishing sixth on points differential, a dangerous position to finish, as the 6th-placed finishers had been eliminated after the first week of the playoffs in the past three seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first finals match was against the Bulldogs at the Sydney Showground (now Spotless Stadium). The Warriors turned on one of their finest performances ever, stunning the Bulldogs early to lead 16ÿ4 at halftime, and after a Bulldogs comeback tied the scores at 16-all, scoring five tries in 16 minutes to blow the Bulldogs away, eventually winning 48ÿ22. Winger Francis Meli scored five tries, a finals record. This prompted Graham Lowe, a known critic of the Warriors to say that the Warriors would win the premiership. The next week a Stacey Jones field-goal in the dying minutes got the Warriors past a gallant Canberra Raiders 17ÿ16. They however lost in the Preliminary Final to the Minor Premiers and eventual Premiers Penrith Panthers, 20ÿ28. It was a disappointing loss for the Warriors, who did not lead at any point of the match, and blew their chance early in the second half to take their first lead, when Henry Fa'afili lost the ball with the line wide open.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the National Rugby League season 2004 started, there were predictions of the Warriors having a highly successful season. These were proved wrong, as the Warriors managed to only win six games to finish equal last, only escaping the wooden spoon by having a superior points differential to South Sydney. Coach Daniel Anderson resigned mid-season after an embarrassing 52-point loss to the Sydney Roosters. His assistant Tony Kemp was given the head coach position, and in his first game in charge the Warriors recorded an emotional 20ÿ14 win over Canberra. A week later, the Warriors' first match in Christchurch since 1996 was a flop, as the Warriors were destroyed by the Wests Tigers 4ÿ50. The season finished with an embarrassing six-game losing streak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe management looked to rescue a poor year with some high-profile signings. Bulldogs captain Steve Price was signed, as was Kiwis captain Ruben Wiki, Cowboys half Nathan Fien and Roosters winger Todd Byrne.\\r\\n\\r\\n2005 was an improvement over the horror scenes of 2004. The team remained competitive for all of their matches, and their largest loss was only 18 points. The team had a good chance to make the finals, however a four match losing streak late in the season removed those chances. The season was tinged with sadness, as it was announced it would be star halfback Stacey Jones last season with the club before he would join French Super League club, Catalans Dragons. His last match for the team against Manly at Brookvale Oval was a fine way for him to sign off with the club as he scored the match-winning try with three minutes to go in a 22ÿ20 victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the season the structure of the team was reviewed. CEO Mick Watson resigned and was replaced by Wayne Scurrah. Tony Kemp was sacked as coach and his assistant Ivan Cleary replaced him as head coach.\\r\\n\\r\\nNational Rugby League season 2006 got off to a bad start for the club. In February, the Warriors were found to have committed major breaches of the salary cap in 2005. This followed the high-profile signings of Steve Price and Ruben Wiki. On 27 February the NRL announced the club would be deducted four competition points and the club would also be fined A$430,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before the penalty the Warriors were expected to struggle and were being picked as wooden spooners in some quarters. With the four point deduction, the Warriors won their first NRL game away from Auckland, with a 26ÿ10 victory over the reigning premiers, the Wests Tigers, at Jade Stadium in Christchurch.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 June the Warriors recorded their largest ever win, defeating South Sydney 66ÿ0 at Telstra Stadium, as part of a four-match winning streak that claimed the scalps of the Sydney Roosters, Newcastle Knights, and also the Penrith Panthers. This streak was ended in an 18ÿ22 golden-point loss to the Bulldogs, in a game where the Warriors surrendered an early 16ÿ0 lead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors finished the season on a positive note leaving room for optimism for 2007 and beyond. They caused arguably the upset of the season, defeating the Minor Premiers Melbourne 24ÿ20 at Olympic Park Stadium in Melbourne, preventing the Storm from going the full regular season unbeaten at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpressively, it took the Warriors 24 weeks to be completely out of finals contention. The Warriors finished winning eight of their final twelve games, including a 42ÿ16 thrashing of the Roosters in Round 25, which included four tries by Jerome Ropati. Had the Warriors not suffered the four-point deduction, they would have finished in eighth place on the ladder, and hence would have taken part in the finals series. As it was, they finished tenth on the ladder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were a number of revelations in the squad. Unheralded halfback Grant Rovelli was a standout performer. Winger Patrick Ah Van has cemented a first grade spot and impressed many with his performances, while George Gatis and Nathan Fien were fine performers at hooker, and centre Simon Mannering has been one of the Warriors most impressive backs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors completed their pre-season with two wins from three games, defeating the Auckland Lions 64ÿ4, losing to the North Queensland Cowboys 32ÿ14 and defeating the Canterbury Bulldogs 36ÿ6.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors finished the 2007 season in fourth place. The season began with a 34ÿ18 victory over Parramatta at Mt Smart Stadium. The following week the side created history by winning their first two games of the season with a 24ÿ14 victory over premiers, the Brisbane Broncos ÿ the first time they have ever won their opening two games of the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a good start which saw the team sitting in fourth place with a 4ÿ2 win-loss record, the team hit a period of indifferent form, falling into a six match losing streak following a last minute win over South Sydney. The team returned to form, defeating Cronulla 12ÿ2 in wild weather at Toyota Park. Following that victory the side won 9 out of 12 games, with one draw. The Warriors clinched a playoff spot with a 36ÿ14 win over an understrength Manly side, and claimed a home final the following week, defeating the Penrith Panthers 24ÿ20 at CUA Stadium in Round 25.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors, by virtue of finishing the regular season in fourth place, won the right to host one of the finals matches in the first week of the playoffs. However, the Warriors narrowly went down to the Parramatta Eels 12ÿ10 at Mount Smart Stadium, and their season ended with an awful 12ÿ49 loss to the Cowboys in Townsville.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 May the Warriors signed Australian Kangaroos' centre, Brent Tate from 2008 to 2010 in what was described as a \\"major coup\\" for the New Zealand club.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2008 season did not start as brightly for the club, losing Wade McKinnon for much of the year during a pre-season loss to Newcastle, and losing captain Steve Price (rugby league) for ten weeks, as well as injuries to other key players Manu Vatuvei, Jerome Ropati and Michael Witt. The team remained in contention for much of the season, however often performed very poorly away from Mt Smart Stadium, and suffered their first loss to South Sydney (28ÿ35) since 1999, and went on to lose to the Rabbitohs again later in the season (16ÿ18). Despite poor results away, strong home form and a now common revival in the second half of the season saw the Warriors make the top eight for the second season running, incredibly despite spending only three weeks in the top eight all season. A top-eight berth was secured in the last game of the season, when the Warriors defeated the Parramatta Eels 28ÿ6 at Parramatta Stadium, marking the first time since 1995 that the Warriors had won away to Parramatta.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith nothing to lose in the first week of the finals, the Warriors caused arguably the greatest finals upset ever, and arguably greatest victory in the history of the club, defeating the Melbourne Storm 18ÿ15 at Olympic Park; in doing so, they became the first 8th placed team to beat the minor premiers, with Michael Witt scoring two minutes from full-time to clinch the win. Witt taunted Melbourne captain, Cameron Smith, before placing the ball for the historic victory.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn week two of the playoffs, the Warriors came from behind to defeat the Sydney Roosters 30ÿ13 at Mt. Smart Stadium. The Roosters led 13ÿ6 at halftime before a second-half comeback saw the Warriors pile on twenty-four unanswered points to earn the Warriors a place in the preliminary finals. This was the first time since 2003 that the Warriors have reached the grand final qualifier, and third overall in 14 seasons. They however went down heavily to an inspired Manly Sea Eagles 32ÿ6.\\r\\n\\r\\n2009 started with the loss of young up-and-comer Sonny Fai, who tragically drowned at Bethells Beach, near Auckland. He had gone into dangerous surf to rescue some relatives but was probably sucked under by a rip. Almost as if using the occurrence as an inhibitor, the Warriors had a very disappointing year, despite winning the opening two rounds against eventual grand finalists Parramatta Eels 26ÿ18 and reigning premiers Manly Sea Eagles.\\r\\nAfter those great wins they proceeded to win a poor 1 of 8 games including a draw.\\r\\nThey did however manage to beat West Tigers 14ÿ0 and the Knights 13ÿ0 keeping both opponents scoreless, but it was the poor attacking that had every league fan questioning. and ultimately saw them lose their next 3 matches by heavy scores. They did beat the Roosters 30ÿ24 at SFS and Raiders 34ÿ20 at Mt Smart Stadium. But in the end the Warriors lost their final two games against the Bulldogs in Hazem El Masri's last home game [before the finals] and ultimately ended their poor season in a bad way losing 0ÿ30 to the eventual premiers Melbourne Storm.\\r\\n\\r\\nExpectations were not high for the Warriors in 2010 after a disappointing 2009 season. The Warriors bolstered their playing stocks in the pivotal play-making positions by signing Brett Seymour after he was cut by Cronulla and James Maloney from Melbourne. In arguably one of their best ever performances they humbled the Brisbane Broncos 48ÿ16 at Suncorp Stadium in Round 3, with Maloney tying a club-record with 28 points (3 tries and 8 goals). Kevin Locke scored a hat-trick in the Warriors miraculous 20ÿ18 win over the Sydney Roosters at AMI Stadium in Christchurch, narrowly escaping a serious hip injury after a high-speed collision with the goal-post (in the process of scoring the game-winning try). The Warriors won five matches in a row for the first time since late in the 2003 season and finished in 5th position in the regular season. They were knocked out of the finals series in the first week, losing to Gold Coast Titans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors began the 2011 season with an historic match at Auckland's Eden Park, the first regular season home game the club had played away from Mt Smart Stadium. The match drew a record home game crowd for the Warriors of 38,405 however unfortunately the Warriors could not repay the large crowd with a victory as they were beaten 24ÿ18 by the Parramatta Eels. The Warriors went on to lose their following two matches and it appeared that Warriors fans were in for another season of disappointment. To their credit the Warriors bounced back and were in the running for a top four position late in the season but finished in 6th spot. Midway through the season coach Ivan Cleary was approached by the Penrith Panthers and was appointed as their coach for the 2012 season. Cleary remained coach for the remainder of the 2011 season and Brian McClennan was to be appointed his successor for the 2012 season. One of the highlights of the season was the unearthing of the young halfback Shaun Johnson who played a key role as the Warriors approached the 2011 finals series.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn week one of the finals series the Warriors were thrashed 40ÿ10 by the Brisbane Broncos. Other results went the Warriors way and they were fortunate to progress to week two of the finals where they would meet a high flying Wests Tigers who had completed their 9th straight victory. The match was expected to go the Tigers way however a brilliant second half comeback by the Warriors culminated in a late and controversial try to Krisnan Inu which saw the Warriors win 22ÿ20 and earn the right to play the Melbourne Storm for a place in the Grand Final.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors traveled to Melbourne as heavy underdogs but turned in what is considered one of the most complete performances in the club's history. The Warriors controlled the match and sealed the Melbourne Storm's fate with Shaun Johnson mesmerising the Storm defence to send Lewis Brown in for the try that would send the Warriors to their second ever Grand Final, where they would meet the Manly Sea Eagles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors would again start the match as heavy underdogs and with a side boasting only three players who had previously played in a Grand Final (Manly on the other hand could boast their coach and eight players who had won the 2008 NRL premiership with the club, plus another who had won a premiership in 2003 with Penrith). Heavy defence from both sides was the feature until the Warriors opened the scoring with a penalty goal to James Maloney in the 28th minute, but a little more than a minute after the restart, a bad read in defence saw prolific try scorer Brett Stewart in for the 1st try. Just before the break, the Warriors were then unlucky not to receive a penalty for obstruction in the lead up to Manly's second try which saw them go into the sheds down 12ÿ2. A further try to Clive Churchill Medal winner Glenn Stewart in the 57th minute saw Manly's lead out to 18ÿ2. The Warriors refused to die however, and clawed their way back with tries to Manu Vatuvei and Elijah Taylor in the 63rd and 68th minutes. Unfortunately Maloney missed both conversions which could have taken the score to 18ÿ14 and a grandstand finish, but a try to Manly captain Jamie Lyon with only a minute remaining put the result beyond doubt as the Warriors were beaten by a clinical Manly outfit 24ÿ10 ÿ yet their effort in reaching just their second ever Grand Final (and their first in nine years) was a triumph for the club and departing coach Ivan Cleary and won praise from those in the NRL.\\r\\n\\r\\n2011 was a successful season all-round for the New Zealand Warriors, with all three grades reaching the Grand Final. The clubs NYC team defeated the North Queensland Cowboys 31ÿ30 in golden point extra time in the NYC Grand Final to win their second premiership, while NSW Cup affiliate the Auckland Vulcans went down 30ÿ28 after conceding a last minute try to Canterbury-Bankstown in the NSW Cup Grand Final.\\r\\n\\r\\n2012 was meant to promise so much for the Warriors following their grand final appearance of 2011. A new coach with a successful track record in Brian 'Bluey' McClennan, a stable squad and strong public support indicated that 2012 could have been the year they finally broke their premiership duck. The season again kicked off with a home game at Eden Park, with a strong crowd of 37,502 witnessing the Warriors go down 20ÿ26 to Manly in a grand final rematch. The match was perhaps an indication of things to come, with the Warriors performing strongly on attack but being let down by weak defence at crucial stages which ultimately cost them the match.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe season did not improve much from that point, with the Warriors failing to find any semblance of consistency throughout the season. There were some highs, such as their 44ÿ22 drubbing of the Rabbitohs, but these were far outweighed by the deep lows. Their season is best summed up by a dismal month of football between Rounds 20 and 23. The Warriors surrendered 19- and 18-nil leads in succession and lost (a first in the history of the game), before leaking 97 points in their next two defeats. In the process they lost all semblance of a quality rugby league team.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nInjuries were not kind to the Warriors, with the side using 29 players over the course of the season ÿ the second highest of any team in the NRL. The Warriors season unravelled over the latter rounds. Ultimately Brian McClennan was sacked with three rounds remaining, with assistant coach Tony Iro taking over the reins for the final two rounds. The change of coach did not result in a change of fortunes however, as the Warriors limped out of the season with an eight match long losing streak ÿ a club record.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing a lengthy search for a new coach former Penrith and Canberra boss Matthew Elliot was appointed as head coach in October 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother horror start for the Warriors in 2013 as they win just 2 of their opening 10 games. The Warriors came back into finals contention winning 7 games out of 8 including a 56ÿ18 win against the Brisbane Broncos in Brisbane. As finals approached the Warriors ended with just 2 wins from their remaining 6 games to see them finish the season 11th. In Round 10, on 18 May the Warriors lost 6ÿ62 to the Penrith Panthers which was their largest ever loss in the club's history. Captain Simon Mannering won the club's Player of the year and Ngani Laumape won Rookie of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the First edition of the NRL Auckland Nines, The Warriors were favourites to win. They finished top of their pool winning all three games but lost the Semi Final to eventual winners North Queensland Cowboys. The Warriors started the season two wins and two loses but in Round 5 after a 37ÿ6 lost to Cronulla Sutherland Sharks the club sacked head coach Matthew Elliott replacing him former Canberra Raiders player Andrew McFadden. Unfortunately the Warriors missed the playoffs for the 3rd season in a row after missing out on points difference to the Brisbane Broncos. Simon Mannering won his 4th Player of the year award, while David Fusitu'a won Rookie of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the Warriors 20th season in the NRL.\\r\\n\\r\\nWarriors ended the season with 8 consecutive loses after Shaun Johnson broke his ankle against Manly Sea Eagles in Round 20. Warriors were knocked out in the Quarter Finals of the 2015 NRL Auckland Nines by eventual runners up Cronulla Sutherland Sharks. Ben Matulino was named club Player of the year with Tuimoala Lolohea named clubs Rookie of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo start off, there was plenty of hype around the Warriors camp about 2016 being the season where they would finally win the Premiership, after the major signings of 2015 Dally M Fullback of the Year Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, from the Sydney Roosters and Kiwi international Issac Luke, from the South Sydney Rabbitohs. The Warriors came runners up in the 2016 NRL Auckland Nines, losing to the Parramatta Eels in the final, 22ÿ4. The Warriors started the season in the worst possible way, losing their first three matches. The Warriors beat the Newcastle Knights 40ÿ18 to record their first win of the season and then defeated the Sydney Roosters in a Golden Point thriller in Gosford a week later. After the embarrassing loss to Melbourne Storm on Anzac Day, the team came under intense scrutiny with many calling for the sacking of coach, Andrew McFadden. As well as this, six Warriors players where stood down after mixing prescription drugs with energy drinks. This scandal did not help the club who were already struggling. After 11 rounds, the Warriors stood at four wins from 11 games. As State of Origin came into effect, the Warriors started to elevate their performance. Winning four from five games, with the exception being a golden point loss to the table-topping Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. After Round 18, the Warriors were in the top eight and needing only to win four out of their final eight games with three of their final four games on home turf. An achievable target, however the club recorded just two wins from their final eight games to finish tenth on the ladder and for the fifth year in a row, missed out on finals. Simon Mannering received his fifth Warriors Player of the Year, with Nathaniel Roache receiving Rookie of the Year. On 12 September 2016 it was announced that Kiwis coach Stephen Kearney would replace Andrew McFadden as head coach for 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the restructuring of the Warriors coaching staff and with the signing of Kieran Foran, there was much anticipation leading into the season for the team. The Auckland Nines were perhaps a sign of things to come as the Warriors were left win-less and at the bottom of their pool. They kicked off the regular season with a narrow victory over the Newcastle Knights. It would be one of few wins for the 2017 season. Heading into their first bye of the season, they had just won six from 14 games. Worse was yet to come. After that bye, they defeated the Canterbury Bulldogs at Mt Smart Stadium in what would turn out to be their last win of the season. After that, the Warriors would go on a losing streak until the season's end, creating a club record of nine straight losses and one of the worst seasons in the clubs history. As well as this, notable names such as Ryan Hoffman, Jacob Lillyman, Charlie Gubb and Kieran Foran had left the club. After so much promise and hype leading up to the championship, it seemed to have been all too familiar for Warriors fans. So much so, during a school visit in September, after their season had ended, one student asked them why they were \\"so bad\\", while another, who had little knowledge of rugby league, asked them where they finished on the competition ladder.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2017, the New Zealand Warriors expressed their interest in applying for a licence to participate in the inaugural NRL Women's season.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a dismal 2017 season, the Warriors made a few key signings.\\r\\n\\r\\nHead coach\\r\\n\\r\\nAssistant coaches\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated: 16 July 2018Source(s): [1]\\r\\n\\r\\n1995ÿ2017\\r\\n\\r\\n1995ÿ1996\\r\\n\\r\\n1997ÿ1999\\r\\n\\r\\n2000\\r\\n\\r\\n2001ÿ2002\\r\\n\\r\\n2003ÿ2005\\r\\n\\r\\n2006ÿ2008\\r\\n\\r\\n2009ÿ2011\\r\\n\\r\\n2012ÿ\\r\\n\\r\\n* indicates player still active.\\r\\n\\r\\n1995ÿ2014\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovered from a 20-point deficit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurrendered a 26-point lead.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurrendered an 18-point lead (three-times).\\r\\n\\r\\nSurrendered a 16-point lead (three-times).\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayed 12: Won 4, Lost 5, Drawn 3\\r\\n\\r\\nLargest attendances at the four venues used as home grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2017, the New Zealand Warriors expressed their interest in applying for a licence to participate in the inaugural NRL Women's Premiership.[11] In March 2018, they were awarded one of four licences for the league's inaugural season, to commence in September of the same year.[12] Luisa Avaiki will coach the side.\\r\\n\\r\\nHead coach\\r\\n\\r\\nAssistant coaches\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated: 16 July 2018Source(s): [2]","input":"Who is the longest serving coach of the nz warriors?"},{"output":"Italy","context":"Olympus Mons ( /??l?mp?s ?m?nz, o?-, -?m?ns/;[4][5] Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 25?km (13.6?mi or 72,000?ft).[6]  Olympus Mons is about two and a half times Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the largest volcano, the tallest planetary mountain, and the second tallest mountain in the Solar System compared to Rheasilvia on Vesta. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \\"Olympic Snow\\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe volcano is located in Mars's western hemisphere at approximately 1839N 22612E? / ?18.65N 226.2E? / 18.65; 226.2,[1] just off the northwestern edge of the Tharsis bulge. The western portion of the volcano lies in the Amazonis quadrangle (MC-8) and the central and eastern portions in the adjoining Tharsis quadrangle (MC-9).\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo impact craters on Olympus Mons have been assigned provisional names by the International Astronomical Union. They are the 15.6?km (9.7?mi)-diameter Karzok crater (1825N 13155W? / ?18.417N 131.917W? / 18.417; -131.917) and the 10.4?km (6.5?mi)-diameter Pangboche crater (1710N 13335W? / ?17.167N 133.583W? / 17.167; -133.583).[8] The craters are notable for being two of several suspected source areas for shergottites, the most abundant class of Martian meteorites.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a shield volcano, Olympus Mons resembles the shape of the large volcanoes making up the Hawaiian Islands. The edifice is about 600?km (370?mi) wide.[10] Because the mountain is so large, with complex structure at its edges, allocating a height to it is difficult. Olympus Mons stands 21?km (13?mi) above the Mars global datum[specify], and its local relief, from the foot of the cliffs which form its northwest margin to its peak, is nearly 22?km (14?mi)[6] (a little over twice the height of Mauna Kea as measured from its base on the ocean floor). The total elevation change from the plains of Amazonis Planitia, over 1,000?km (620?mi) to the northwest, to the summit approaches 26?km (16?mi).[3] The summit of the mountain has six nested calderas (collapsed craters) forming an irregular depression 60?km (37?mi) G 80?km (50?mi) across[11] and up to 3.2?km (2.0?mi) deep.[12] The volcano's outer edge consists of an escarpment, or cliff, up to 8?km (5.0?mi) tall (although obscured by lava flows in places), a feature unique among the shield volcanoes of Mars.[13] Olympus Mons covers an area of about 300,000?km2 (120,000?sq?mi)[14], which is approximately the size of Italy, and it is supported by a 70?km (43?mi) thick lithosphere. The extraordinary size of Olympus Mons is likely because Mars lacks mobile tectonic plates. Unlike on Earth, the crust of Mars remains fixed over a stationary hotspot, and a volcano can continue to discharge lava until it reaches an enormous height.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a shield volcano, Olympus Mons has a very gently sloping profile. The average slope on the volcano's flanks is only 5.[12] Slopes are steepest near the middle part of the flanks and grow shallower toward the base, giving the flanks a concave upward profile. The shape of Olympus Mons is distinctly asymmetrical - its flanks are shallower and extend farther from the summit in the northwestern direction than they do to the southeast. The volcano's shape and profile have been likened to a \\"circus tent\\" held up by a single pole that is shifted off center.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the size and shallow slopes of Olympus Mons, an observer standing on the Martian surface would be unable to view the entire profile of the volcano, even from a great distance. The curvature of the planet and the volcano itself would obscure such a synoptic view.[17] Similarly, an observer near the summit would be unaware of standing on a very high mountain, as the slope of the volcano would extend far beyond the horizon, a mere 3 kilometers away.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe typical atmospheric pressure at the top of Olympus Mons is 72 pascals, about 12% of the average Martian surface pressure of 600 pascals.[19][20] Both are exceedingly low by terrestrial standards; by comparison, the atmospheric pressure at the summit of Mount Everest is 32,000 pascals, or about 32% of Earth's sea level pressure.[21] Even so, high-altitude orographic clouds frequently drift over the Olympus Mons summit, and airborne Martian dust is still present.[22] Although the average Martian surface atmospheric pressure is less than one percent of Earth's, the much lower gravity of Mars increases the atmosphere's scale height; in other words, Mars's atmosphere is expansive and does not drop off in density with height as sharply as Earth's.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe composition of Olympus Mons is approximately 44% silicates, 17.5% iron oxides (which give the planet its red coloration) 7% aluminum, 6% magnesium, 6% calcium, and particularly high proportions of sulfur oxide with 7%. These results point to the surface being largely composed of basalts and other mafic rocks, which would have erupted as low viscosity lava flows and hence lead to the low gradients on the surface of the planet. \\r\\n\\r\\nOlympus Mons is an unlikely landing location for automated space probes in the near future. The high elevations preclude parachute-assisted landings because the atmosphere is insufficiently dense to slow the spacecraft down. Moreover, Olympus Mons stands in one of the dustiest regions of Mars. A mantle of fine dust obscures the underlying bedrock, possibly making rock samples hard to come by and likely posing a significant obstacle for rovers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOlympus Mons is the result of many thousands of highly fluid, basaltic lava flows that poured from volcanic vents over a long period of time (The Hawaiian Islands exemplify similar shield volcanoes on a smaller scale ÿ see Mauna Kea). Like the basalt volcanoes on Earth, Martian basaltic volcanoes are capable of erupting enormous quantities of ash. Due to the reduced gravity of Mars compared to Earth, there are lesser buoyant forces on the magma rising out of the crust. In addition, the magma chambers are thought to be much larger and deeper than the ones found on Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flanks of Olympus Mons are made up of innumerable lava flows and channels. Many of the flows have levees along their margins (pictured). The cooler, outer margins of the flow solidify, leaving a central trough of molten, flowing lava. Partially collapsed lava tubes are visible as chains of pit craters, and broad lava fans formed by lava emerging from intact, subsurface tubes are also common.[23] In places along the volcano's base, solidified lava flows can be seen spilling out into the surrounding plains, forming broad aprons, and burying the basal escarpment. Crater counts from high-resolution images taken by the Mars Express orbiter in 2004 indicate that lava flows on the northwestern flank of Olympus Mons range in age from 115 million years old (Mya) to only 2 Mya.[24] These ages are very recent in geological terms, suggesting that the mountain may still be volcanically active, though in a very quiescent and episodic fashion.[25]\\r\\nThe caldera complex at the peak of the volcano is made of at least six overlapping calderas and caldera segments (pictured).[26] Calderas are formed by roof collapse following depletion and withdrawal of the subsurface magma chamber after an eruption. Each caldera thus represents a separate pulse of volcanic activity on the mountain.[27] The largest and oldest caldera segment appears to have formed as a single, large lava lake.[28] Using geometric relationships of caldera dimensions from laboratory models, scientists have estimated that the magma chamber associated with the largest caldera on Olympus Mons lies at a depth of about 32?km (105,000?ft) below the caldera floor.[29] Crater size-frequency distributions on the caldera floors indicate the calderas range in age from 350?Mya to about 150?Mya. All probably formed within 100 million years of each other.[30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOlympus Mons is asymmetrical structurally as well as topographically. The longer, more shallow northwestern flank displays extensional features, such as large slumps and normal faults. In contrast, the volcano's steeper southeastern side has features indicating compression, including step-like terraces in the volcano's mid-flank region (interpreted as thrust faults[32]) and a number of wrinkle ridges located at the basal escarpment. Why opposite sides of the mountain should show different styles of deformation may lie in how large shield volcanoes grow laterally and in how variations within the volcanic substrate have affected the mountain's final shape.\\r\\n\\r\\nLarge shield volcanoes grow not only by adding material to their flanks as erupted lava, but also by spreading laterally at their bases. As a volcano grows in size, the stress field underneath the volcano changes from compressional to extensional. A subterranean rift may develop at the base of the volcano, causing the underlying crust to spread apart.[33] If the volcano rests on sediments containing mechanically weak layers (e.g., beds of water-saturated clay), detachment zones (decollements) may develop in the weak layers. The extensional stresses in the detachment zones can produce giant landslides and normal faults on the volcano's flanks, leading to the formation of a basal escarpment.[34] Further from the volcano, these detachment zones can express themselves as a succession of overlapping, gravity driven thrust faults. This mechanism has long been cited as an explanation of the Olympus Mons aureole deposits (discussed below).[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOlympus Mons lies at the edge of the Tharsis bulge, an ancient vast volcanic plateau likely formed by the end of the Noachian Period. During the Hesperian, when Olympus Mons began to form, the volcano was located on a shallow slope that descended from the high in Tharsis into the northern lowland basins. Over time, these basins received large volumes of sediment eroded from Tharsis and the southern highlands. The sediments likely contained abundant Noachian-aged phyllosilicates (clays) formed during an early period on Mars when surface water was abundant,[36] and were thickest in the northwest where basin depth was greatest. As the volcano grew through lateral spreading, low-friction detachment zones preferentially developed in the thicker sediment layers to the northwest, creating the basal escarpment and widespread lobes of aureole material (Lycus Sulci). Spreading also occurred to the southeast; however, it was more constrained in that direction by the Tharsis rise, which presented a higher-friction zone at the volcano's base. Friction was higher in that direction because the sediments were thinner and probably consisted of coarser grained material resistant to sliding. The competent and rugged basement rocks of Tharsis acted as an additional source of friction. This inhibition of southeasterly basal spreading in Olympus Mons could account for the structural and topographic asymmetry of the mountain. Numerical models of particle dynamics involving lateral differences in friction along the base of Olympus Mons have been shown to reproduce the volcano's present shape and asymmetry fairly well.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been speculated that the detachment along the weak layers was aided by the presence of high-pressure water in the sediment pore spaces, which would have interesting astrobiological implications. If water-saturated zones still exist in sediments under the volcano, they would likely have been kept warm by a high geothermal gradient and residual heat from the volcano's magma chamber. Potential springs or seeps around the volcano would offer exciting possibilities for detecting microbial life.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nOlympus Mons and a few other volcanoes in the Tharsis region stand high enough to reach above the frequent Martian dust-storms recorded by telescopic observers as early as the 19th century. The astronomer Patrick Moore pointed out that Schiaparelli (1835ÿ1910) \\"had found that his Nodus Gordis and Olympic Snow [Nix Olympica] were almost the only features to be seen\\" during dust storms, and \\"guessed correctly that they must be high\\".[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mariner 9 spacecraft arrived in orbit around Mars in 1971 during a global dust-storm. The first objects to become visible as the dust began to settle, the tops of the Tharsis volcanoes, demonstrated that the altitude of these features greatly exceeded that of any mountain found on Earth, as astronomers expected. Observations of the planet from Mariner 9 confirmed that Nix Olympica was not just a mountain, but a volcano. Ultimately, astronomers adopted the name Olympus Mons for the albedo feature known as Nix Olympica.\\r\\n\\r\\nOlympus Mons is located between the northwestern edge of the Tharsis region and the eastern edge of Amazonis Planitia. It stands about 1,200?km (750?mi) from the other three large Martian shield volcanoes, collectively called the Tharsis Montes (Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons). The Tharsis Montes are slightly smaller than Olympus Mons.\\r\\n\\r\\nA wide, annular depression or moat about 2?km (1.2?mi) deep surrounds the base of Olympus Mons and is thought to be due to the volcano's immense weight pressing down on the Martian crust. The depth of this depression is greater on the northwest side of the mountain than on the southeast side.\\r\\n\\r\\nOlympus Mons is partially surrounded by a region of distinctive grooved or corrugated terrain known as the Olympus Mons aureole. The aureole consists of several large lobes. Northwest of the volcano, the aureole extends a distance of up to 750?km (470?mi) and is known as Lycus Sulci (2436N 21900E? / ?24.6N 219E? / 24.6; 219). East of Olympus Mons, the aureole is partially covered by lava flows, but where it is exposed it goes by different names (Gigas Sulci, for example). The origin of the aureole remains debated, but it was likely formed by huge landslides [13] or gravity-driven thrust sheets that sloughed off the edges of the Olympus Mons shield.[39]","input":"The extinct martian volcano olympus mons is about the size of?"},{"output":"Robert Hutchings Goddard","context":"","input":"Who built the worlds first liquid-fueled rocket?"},{"output":"an American children's television series","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBear in the Big Blue House is an American children's television series created by Mitchell Kriegman and produced by Jim Henson Television for Disney Channel's Playhouse Disney preschool television block.

On 29 May 1953, Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing Norgay became the first climbers confirmed to have reached the summit of Mount Everest. They were part of the ninth British expedition to Everest, led by John Hunt.\\r\\nHillary became interested in mountaineering while in secondary school. He made his first major climb in 1939, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier. He served in the Royal New Zealand Air Force as a navigator during World War II. Prior to the Everest expedition, Hillary had been part of the British reconnaissance expedition to the mountain in 1951 as well as an unsuccessful attempt to climb Cho Oyu in 1952. As part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition he reached the South Pole overland in 1958. He subsequently reached the North Pole, making him the first person to reach both poles and summit Everest.\\r\\nFollowing his ascent of Everest, Hillary devoted himself to assisting the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he established. His efforts are credited with the construction of many schools and hospitals in Nepal. From 1985 to 1988 he served as New Zealand's High Commissioner to India and Bangladesh and concurrently as Ambassador to Nepal. Hillary had numerous honours conferred upon him, including the Order of the Garter in 1995. Upon his death in 2008, he was given a state funeral in New Zealand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary was born to Percival Augustus and Gertrude (ne Clark) Hillary in Auckland, New Zealand, on 20 July 1919.[1][2] His family moved to Tuakau, south of Auckland, in 1920, after his father, who served at Gallipoli with the 15th (North Auckland) Regiment, was allocated land there.[2] His grandparents had emigrated from Yorkshire to northern Wairoa in the mid-19th century.[3]\\r\\nHillary was educated at Tuakau Primary School and then Auckland Grammar School.[2] He finished primary school two years early and at high school achieved average marks.[4] He was initially smaller than his peers and shy, but eventually grew to 6?feet 2?inches (188?cm) and gained confidence after taking up boxing. He became interested in climbing when he was 16 following a school trip to Mount Ruapehu, after which he showed more interest in tramping than in studying and said he \\"wanted to see the world\\".[5][6]\\r\\nHe studied mathematics and science at Auckland University College and in 1939 completed his first major climb, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier, near Aoraki / Mount Cook in the Southern Alps.[2] He took up beekeeping with his brother,[1][7] which occupied him in the summer while he concentrated on climbing in winter.[8] His father was a beekeeper, and although Hillary's inclination was for climbing, he became a professional beekeeper.[9][10] He joined the Radiant Living Tramping Club, where a health philosophy developed by Herbert Sutcliffe was taught; tours with the club through the Waitakere Ranges further developed his love of the outdoors.[11]\\r\\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Hillary applied to join the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) but quickly withdrew the application, later writing that he was \\"harassed by my religious conscience\\".[12] In 1943, with the Japanese threat in the Pacific and the arrival of conscription, he joined the RNZAF as a navigator in No. 6 Squadron RNZAF and later No. 5 Squadron RNZAF on Catalina flying boats.[12][13] In 1945, he was sent to Fiji and to the Solomon Islands, where he was badly burnt in an accident.[12]\\r\\nIn January 1948, Hillary and others ascended the south ridge of Aoraki / Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest peak.[14] In 1951 he was part of a British reconnaissance expedition to Everest led by Eric Shipton,[15] before joining the successful British attempt of 1953. In 1952, Hillary and George Lowe were part of the British team led by Shipton, that attempted Cho Oyu.[16] After that attempt failed due to the lack of route from the Nepal side, Hillary and Lowe crossed the Nup La pass into Tibet and reached the old Camp II, on the northern side, where all the previous expeditions had camped.[17]\\r\\nIn 1949, the long-standing climbing route to the summit of Everest was closed by Chinese-controlled Tibet. For the next several years, Nepal allowed only one or two expeditions per year.[19] A Swiss expedition (in which Tenzing took part) attempted to reach the summit in 1952, but was forced back by bad weather around 800 feet (240?m) below the summit.[20] In 1952 Hillary learned that he and Lowe had been invited by the Joint Himalayan Committee for the 1953 British attempt and immediately accepted.[21]\\r\\nShipton was named as leader but was replaced by Hunt. Hillary was immediately impressed by Hunt's energy and determination.[22] Hillary had intended to climb with Lowe, but Hunt named two teams for the assault: Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans; and Hillary and Tenzing.[23] Hillary, therefore, made a concerted effort to forge a working friendship with Tenzing.[22]\\r\\nThe Hunt expedition totalled over 400 people, including 362 porters, 20 Sherpa guides, and 10,000 pounds (4,500?kg) of baggage.[24][25] Lowe supervised the preparation of the Lhotse Face, a huge and steep ice face, for climbing. Hillary forged a route through the treacherous Khumbu Icefall.[26][27]\\r\\nThe expedition set up base camp in March 1953 and, working slowly, set up its final camp at the South Col at 25,900 feet (7,890?m). On 26 May, Bourdillon and Evans attempted the climb but turned back when Evans' oxygen system failed. The pair had reached the South Summit, coming within 300 vertical feet (91 m) of the summit.[25][28] Hunt then directed Hillary and Tenzing to attempt the summit.[28]\\r\\nSnow and wind delayed them at the South Col for two days. They set out on 28 May with the support of Lowe, Alfred Gregory, and Ang Nyima.[29] The two pitched a tent at 27,900 feet (8,500?m) on 28 May, while their support group returned down the mountain.[30] On the following morning Hillary discovered that his boots had frozen solid outside the tent. He spent two hours warming them over a stove before he and Tenzing, wearing 30-pound (14?kg) packs, attempted the final ascent.[31] The final obstacle was the 40-foot (12?m) rock face now called \\"Hillary Step\\"; Hillary later wrote:\\r\\nI noticed a crack between the rock and the snow sticking to the East Face. I crawled inside and wriggled and jammed my way to the top?... Tenzing slowly joined me and we moved on. I chopped steps over bump after bump, wondering a little desperately where the top could be. Then I saw the ridge ahead dropped away to the north and above me on the right was a rounded snow dome. A few more whacks with my ice-axe and Tenzing and I stood on top of Everest.[32]\\r\\nTenzing later wrote that Hillary took the first step onto the summit and he followed. They reached Everest's 29,028?ft (8,848 m) summit?ÿ the highest point on earth?ÿ at 11:30?am.[1][33]\\r\\nThey spent about 15 minutes at the summit. Hillary took a photo of Tenzing posing with his ice-axe, but there is no photo of Hillary. BBC News attributed this to Tenzing's having never used a camera;[34][35] Tenzing's autobiography says that Hillary simply declined to have his picture taken. They also took photos looking down the mountain.[35]\\r\\nTenzing left chocolates at the summit as an offering, and Hillary left a cross given him by John Hunt.[36] Their descent was complicated by drifting snow which had covered their tracks. The first person they met was Lowe; Hillary said, \\"Well, George, we knocked the bastard off.\\"[6]\\r\\nThey returned to Kathmandu a few days later and learned that Hillary had already been appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire and Hunt a Knight Bachelor.[37] News reached Britain on the day of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, and the press called it a coronation gift.[38] The 37 members of the party later received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal with mount everest expedition engraved along the rim.[39] In addition to the knighting of Hillary and Hunt, Tenzing?ÿ ineligible for knighthood as a Nepalese citizen?ÿ received the George Medal.[40][41][42] Tenzing also received the Star of Nepal from King Tribhuvan.[43]\\r\\nHillary climbed ten other peaks in the Himalayas on further visits in 1956, 1960ÿ1961, and 1963ÿ1965. He also reached the South Pole as part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, for which he led the New Zealand section, on 4 January 1958. His party was the first to reach the Pole overland since Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912, and the first ever to do so using motor vehicles.[44]\\r\\nIn 1960 Hillary organized an expedition to search for the fabled abominable snowman.[45] Hillary was with the expedition for five months, although it lasted for ten.[46] No evidence of Yetis was found, instead footprints and tracks were proven to be from other causes. During the expedition, Hillary travelled to remote temples which contained \\"Yeti scalps\\"; however after bringing back three relics, two were shown to be from bears and one from a goat antelope.[47][48] Hillary said after the expedition: \\"The yeti is not a strange, superhuman creature as has been imagined. We have found rational explanations for most yeti phenomena\\".[49]\\r\\nIn 1962 he was a guest on the television game show What's My Line?; he stumped the panel, comprising Dorothy Kilgallen, Arlene Francis, Bennett Cerf, and Merv Griffin.[50] In 1977, he led a jetboat expedition, titled \\"Ocean to Sky\\", from the mouth of the Ganges River to its source.[51] From 1977 to 1979 he commentated aboard Antarctic sightseeing flights operated by Air New Zealand.[52] In 1985, he accompanied Neil Armstrong in a small twin-engined ski plane over the Arctic Ocean and landed at the North Pole. Hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of Everest.[53][54][55][56] This accomplishment inspired generations of explorers to compete over what later was defined as Three Poles Challenge. In January 2007, Hillary travelled to Antarctica as part of a delegation commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of Scott Base.[57][58][59]\\r\\nOn 6 June 1953 Hillary was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire and received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal the same year.[60] On 6 February 1987, he was the fourth appointee to the Order of New Zealand.[61] He was also awarded the Polar Medal in 1958 for his part in the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition,[62][63] the Order of Gorkha Dakshina Bahu, 1st Class of the Kingdom of Nepal in 1953, and the Coronation Medal in 1975.[64] On 22 April 1995 Hillary was appointed Knight Companion of The Most Noble Order of the Garter.[65][66] On 17 June 2004 Hillary was awarded Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland.[67] The Government of India conferred on him its second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, posthumously, in 2008.[68]\\r\\nTo mark the 50th anniversary of the first successful ascent of Everest, the Nepalese government conferred honorary citizenship upon Hillary at a special Golden Jubilee celebration in Kathmandu, Nepal. He was the first foreign national to receive that honour.[69][10]\\r\\nSince 1992, New Zealand's $5 note has featured Hillary's portrait, making him the only living person not a current head of state ever to appear on a New Zealand banknote. In giving his permission, Hillary insisted that Aoraki / Mount Cook rather than Mount Everest be used as the backdrop.[70][71]\\r\\nAnnual Reader's Digest polls from 2005 to 2007 named Hillary as \\"New Zealand's most trusted individual\\".[73][74]\\r\\nHillary's favoured New Zealand charity was the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre, of which he was patron for 35 years.[75] He was particularly keen on how this organisation introduced young New Zealanders to the outdoors in a very similar way to his first experience of a school trip to Mt Ruapehu at the age of 16. A 2.3-metre (7.5?ft) bronze statue of Hillary was erected outside The Hermitage Hotel at Mount Cook Village; it was unveiled by Hillary himself in 2003.[76] Various streets, institutions and organisations around New Zealand and abroad are named after him ÿ for example, the Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate in Otara, which was established by Hillary in 2001.[77]\\r\\nTwo Antarctic features are named after Hillary. The Hillary Coast is a section of coastline south of Ross Island and north of the Shackleton Coast.[78] The Hillary Canyon, an undersea feature in the Ross Sea, appears on the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, published by the International Hydrographic Organization.[79]\\r\\nHillary married Louise Mary Rose on 3 September 1953, soon after the ascent of Everest; he admitted he was terrified of proposing to her and relied on her mother to propose on his behalf.[7][8][80] They had three children: Peter (born 1954), Sarah (born 1955) and Belinda (1959ÿ1975).[1][28] In 1975 while en route to join Hillary in the village of Phaphlu, where he was helping to build a hospital, Louise and Belinda were killed in a plane crash near Kathmandu airport shortly after take-off.[7] In 1989 he married June Mulgrew, the widow of his close friend Peter Mulgrew, who died on Air New Zealand Flight 901 in 1979.[8][81]\\r\\nHis son Peter Hillary also became a climber, summiting Everest in 1990. In May 2002 Peter climbed Everest as part of a 50th anniversary celebration; Jamling Tenzing Norgay (son of Tenzing who had died in 1986) was also part of the expedition.[82]\\r\\nHillary's home for most of his life was a property on Remuera Road in Auckland City,[83] where he enjoyed reading adventure and science fiction novels in his retirement.[83] He also built a bach at Whites Beach,[84] one of Auckland's west coast beaches in the former Waitakere City, between Anawhata and North Piha;[85][86] a friend called it Hillary's place of solace, where he could escape media attention.[84]\\r\\nThe Hillary family has had a connection with the west coast of Auckland since 1925, when Louise's father built a bach at Anawhata.[87] The family donated land at Whites Beach that is now crossed by trampers on the Hillary Trail, named for Edmund.[88] Hillary said of the area: \\"That is the thing that international travel brings home to me ÿ it's always good to be going home. This is the only place I want to live in; this is the place I want to see out my days.\\"[89]\\r\\nFollowing his ascent of Everest he devoted himself to assisting the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he established in 1960[90] and led until his death in 2008. His efforts are credited with the construction of many schools and hospitals in this remote region of the Himalayas. He was the Honorary President of the American Himalayan Foundation, a United States non-profit body that helps improve the ecology and living conditions in the Himalayas. He was also the Honorary President of Mountain Wilderness, an international NGO dedicated to the worldwide protection of mountains.[91]\\r\\nHillary supported the Labour Party in the 1975 New Zealand general election, as a member of the \\"Citizens for Rowling\\" campaign. His involvement in this campaign was seen as precluding his nomination as Governor-General;[92] the position was offered to Keith Holyoake in 1977. In 1985, Hillary was appointed New Zealand High Commissioner to India (concurrently High Commissioner to Bangladesh and Ambassador to Nepal) and spent four and a half years based in New Delhi.[93]\\r\\nIn 1975, Hillary served as a vice president for the Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand,[94] a national pro-choice advocacy group.[95] He was also a patron of REPEAL, an organization seeking repeal of the restrictive Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977.[94]\\r\\nOn 22 April 2007, while on a trip to Kathmandu, Hillary suffered a fall, and was hospitalised after returning to New Zealand.[96] On 11 January 2008 he died of heart failure at Auckland City Hospital.[97] Flags were lowered to half-mast on New Zealand public buildings and at Scott Base in Antarctica,[98] and Prime Minister Helen Clark called Hillary's death a \\"profound loss to New Zealand\\".[99]\\r\\nOn 21 January, Hillary's casket was taken into Holy Trinity Cathedral, Auckland, to lie in state.[100] A state funeral was held on 22 January 2008,[101] after which his body was cremated. On 29 February 2008 most of his ashes were scattered in Auckland's Hauraki Gulf per his desire.[102] The remainder went to a Nepalese monastery near Everest; a plan to scatter them on the summit was cancelled in 2010.[103]\\r\\nIn January 2008, Lukla Airport, in Lukla, Nepal, was renamed to TenzingÿHillary Airport in recognition of their promotion of its construction.[104][105] On 2 April 2008, a service of thanksgiving in Hillary's honour at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle was attended by Queen Elizabeth, New Zealand dignitaries including Prime Minister Helen Clark, and members of Hillary's and Norgay's families; Gurkha soldiers from Nepal stood guard outside the ceremony.[106][107] In October 2008, it was announced that future rugby test matches between England and New Zealand would be played for the Hillary Shield.[108] In 2009 the Duke of Edinburgh's Award in New Zealand?ÿ formerly the Young New Zealanders' Challenge?ÿ was renamed \\"The Duke of Edinburgh's Hillary Award\\".[109] On 5 November 2008, a commemorative set of five stamps was issued by New Zealand Post.[110][111]\\r\\nThere have been many calls for lasting tributes to Hillary. The first major public tribute has been by way of the \\"Summits for Ed\\" tribute tour organised by the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation.[112] This tribute tour went from Bluff at the bottom of the South Island to Cape Reinga at the tip of the North Island, visiting 39 towns and cities along the way. In each venue, school children and members of the public were invited to join together to climb a significant hill or site in their area to show their respect for Hillary. The public were also invited to bring small rocks or pebbles that had special significance to them, that would be included in a memorial to Hillary at the base of Mt Ruapehu, in the grounds of the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre. Funds donated during the tour are used by the foundation to sponsor young New Zealanders on outdoor courses. Over 8,000 persons attended these \\"Summit\\" climbs between March and May 2008.[113]\\r\\nThe tribute song \\"Hillary 88\\", by the New Zealand duo The Kiwis, is the official world memorial song for Hillary, with the endorsement of Lady Hillary.[114]\\r\\nA four-day track in the Waitakere Ranges, along Auckland's west coast, is named the Hillary Trail,[115] in honour of Hillary.[88] Hillary's father-in-law, Jim Rose, who had built a bach at Anawhata in 1925, wrote in his 1982 history of Anawhata Beach, \\"My family look forward to the time when we will be able to walk from Huia to Muriwai on public walking tracks like the old-time Maori could do\\".[87][116] Hillary loved the area, and had his own bach near Anawhata. The track was opened on 11 January 2010, the second anniversary of Hillary's death.[97][117] Rose Track, descending from Anawhata Road to Whites Beach, is named after the Rose family.[89][118]\\r\\nThe South Ridge of Aoraki / Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest mountain, was renamed Hillary Ridge on 18 August 2011. Hillary and three other climbers were the first party to successfully climb the ridge in 1948.[119] In September 2013 the Government of Nepal proposed naming a 7,681 metres (25,200?ft) mountain in Nepal Hillary Peak in his honour.[120] After the New Horizons mission discovered a mountain range on Pluto on 14 July 2015, it was informally named Hillary Montes (Hillary Mountains) by NASA.[121]\\r\\nThe Sir Edmund Hillary Mountain Legacy Medal, awarded by the Nepalese NGO Mountain Legacy \\"for remarkable service in the conservation of culture and nature in mountainous regions\\" was inaugurated in 2003, with the approval of Sir Edmund Hillary. A bronze bust of Hillary (circa 1953) by Ophelia Gordon Bell is in the Te Papa museum in Wellington, New Zealand.[122] The Sir Edmund Hillary Archive was added to the UNESCO Memory of the world archive in 2013,[123] it is currently held by Auckland War Memorial Museum.[124]","input":"Who was the first one to climb mount everest?"},{"output":"M47 Pattons","context":"Battle of the Bulge is a 1965 American widescreen epic war film produced in Spain, directed by Ken Annakin, and starring Henry Fonda, Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas, Robert Ryan, Dana Andrews and Charles Bronson. The feature was filmed in Ultra Panavision 70 and exhibited in 70?mm Cinerama. Battle of the Bulge had its world premiere on December 16, 1965, the 21st anniversary of the titular battle, at the Pacific Cinerama Dome Theatre in Hollywood, California.\\r\\nThe filmmakers attempted to condense the Ardennes Counteroffensive, a World War II battle that stretched across parts of Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg and lasted nearly a month into under three hours. They also shot parts of the film on terrain that did not resemble actual battle locations. This left them open to criticism for lack of historical accuracy, but they claimed in the end credits that they had \\"re-organized\\" the chronological order of events to maximize the dramatic story.\\r\\nUnlike most World War II epics, Battle of the Bulge contains virtually no portrayals of actual senior Allied leaders, civilian or military. This is presumably because of controversies surrounding the battle, both during the war and after. Though Allied forces ultimately won the battle, the initial German counteroffensive caught them by surprise and caused many casualties.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is December, 1944. Military Intelligence officer and former policeman Lt. Col. Daniel Kiley (Fonda) and his pilot, Joe, are flying a reconnaissance mission over the Ardennes forest. Spotting a German staff car the plane buzzes the car and photographs the officer. Alarmed, the chauffeur flees the car leaving the engine running. \\"Petrol is blood,\\" rebukes the German officer, marking a theme of the film, the German shortage of fuel.\\r\\nIn a subterranean lair, it is revealed the officer is Col. Martin Hessler (Shaw), a fictional Panzer tank commander loosely based on SS-Standartenfhrer Jochen Peiper. Hessler is briefed by his superior, Gen. Kohler (Werner Peters), on a new German attack, piercing west against the American lines. Kohler points out a clock with a 50-hour countdown, which is the time allotted for the operation, beyond which Germany has no resources for full-scale attack. At the same time German soldiers disguised as American troops, led by Lt. Schumacher (Ty Hardin), are tasked with seizing vital bridges and sowing confusion behind the Allied lines.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Kiley returns to headquarters where he warns that the Germans are planning one more all-out offensive. His superiors, Gen. Grey (Robert Ryan) and Col. Pritchard (Dana Andrews), dismiss it out of hand: all available intelligence points to Germany not having the resources and manpower to launch another attack. Hoping to uncover more proof, Kiley visits a US infantry position on the Siegfried Line under command of Maj. Wolenski (Charles Bronson). A patrol led by Lt. Weaver (James MacArthur) and Sgt. Duquesne (George Montgomery) capture some young and obviously inexperienced German soldiers. Kiley concludes that experienced German troops have been replaced by these men and withdrawn for an offensive, but Pritchard dismisses this as well.\\r\\nHessler launches his attack the next day. Awakened by the noise of German tanks, Wolenski leads his men into the wooded area of the Schnee Eifel, where they try to fight them off but are overrun. A group of Allied tanks led by Sgt. Guffy (Telly Savalas) also attempts to slow the Panzers, but their tanks' weak guns and thin armor make them ineffective, forcing him and his crew to retreat.\\r\\nLt. Schumacher and his disguised troops capture the only bridge over the Our River capable of carrying heavy tanks. Hessler continues his spearhead toward Ambleve, while being observed by Kiley. Schumacher later takes control of a vital intersection of three roads connecting Ambleve, Malmedy and the Siegfried Line. He sabotages the road signs, and the rear echelon of Wolenski's troops take the wrong road to Malmedy; almost the entire unit is captured and massacred. Lt. Weaver manages to escape, but Duquesne is killed. US soldiers become suspicious when they witness Schumacher's \\"military police\\" lay explosives incorrectly on the Our bridge, and his masquerade is revealed.\\r\\nHessler's tanks and infantry storm Ambleve, finally taking the town. Although many Americans, including Wolenski, are captured, Grey, Pritchard, Kiley and others escape to the River Meuse. American forces regroup and begin to reorganize for a counterattack. Facing the dangers of a foggy night, Col. Kiley conducts an aerial reconnaissance in an attempt to locate the main German spearhead. He orders the pilot to shut off the engine and glide in an attempt to listen for enemy tanks. Suddenly, through a gap in the fog, he spots Hessler's tank column heading toward American lines. Kiley radios in the coordinates, but his plane is hit by German fire and crashes near an American fuel depot.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Gen. Grey's forces, with the Meuse at their back, prepare to fight off Hessler. The outgunned, outarmored American tanks are systematically destroyed, but at the cost of the Germans burning up much of their fuel. Guffy, Weaver and the surviving Americans head to the depot.\\r\\nAware of the fuel shortages, Hessler leads a detachment toward the depot to capture its stocks. Weaver and the stragglers arrive first. Weaver recognizes Lt. Schumacher, who is still posing as an American MP and whose men have taken control of the depot, but Schumacher doesn't recognize him. At Weaver's signal, he and his men open fire on the disguised Germans, killing them all. The US defenders flood the road with gasoline and set it ablaze. Nearly all the German tanks are destroyed in the fire, including Hessler's. The remaining Germans give up the attack, marching back to Germany.\\r\\nThe final tank battle is a rough depiction of the Battle of Celles on December 26, 1944, where the U.S. 2nd Armored Div. smashed the German 2nd Panzer Division. The film creates the false impression that large numbers of American tanks sacrificed themselves against the heavy Tiger IIs and in the process lured the enemy off course, which caused them to run out of gas. In reality, they were already stranded. The tanks used (despite the claims of the producer in an interview which is one of the DVD extras) are not historically accurate; although the M24 Chaffee light tanks used in the scene were World War II-era vehicles, they were not in use in the scale shown in the film and were relatively rare. Unfortunately, the US M47 Pattons as representing German King Tiger tanks and the M4 Shermans as represented by the aforementioned M24 Chaffees contributed much to the myth or 'meme' of the 'superior size and firepower which US armor had to contend with.' But in WWII, that was actually the task and work of the (mobile) artillery.\\r\\nAside from the initial American encounters with the German offensive, there is some absence of cold weather and snow, which were the conditions in which the real battle was fought. There is no trace of snow at all in the film's major tank battle scene, nor were some battle scenes fought in flat and bare territory, considering the mountainous, forested and grassy nature of the Ardennes. The film was shot on location in the Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range and Madrid, Spain.\\r\\nThe sequence with Lt. Schumacher and his men was based on Operation Greif, the plan to parachute English-speaking Germans using American equipment behind American lines to sow confusion and capture the bridges.\\r\\nAbsent from this movie is the response by Gen. George Patton, whose Third Army relieved the siege of Bastogne. Also, there are no African-Americans in the movie even though the 761st Tank Battalion (The Black Panthers) played a role in Patton's Third Army. Indeed, there is no reference to British forces in the area, although British troops were largely kept behind the Meuse River and thus almost entirely out of the fighting. Also not mentioned is Gen. Eisenhower's decision to split the Bulge front in two, ceding temporary command of two American armies to Field Marshal Montgomery in the northern half of the Bulge; the film implies a totally American operation. There was also no mention of the role of Allied air power hitting the Germans hard at the first sign of clear weather.\\r\\nThe film's opening narration, by William Conrad, does mention both Montgomery and Patton, but is inaccurate, saying:\\r\\nto the north, stood Montgomery's Eighth Army. To the south, Patton's Third Army.\\r\\nIn fact, Montgomery's northern command was actually the 21st Army Group. The Eighth Army, Montgomery's previous command, was actually in Italy at the time of the Battle of the Bulge. Although Patton was in charge of Third Army during the battle, this army was part of a much larger American force in the south. Third Army was one of four American armies that constituted the 12th Army Group under Gen. Omar Bradley.\\r\\nThe film recaptures the major aspects of the battle, depicting how the inexperienced replacement American units stationed in the Ardennes were initially overwhelmed, and how confused the situation became. It points out the superiority of heavy German tanks, along with their major weakness  a lack of fuel. Some early scenes, showing discussions among German officers, accurately depict the Third Reich's desperation to cut U.S.-British supply lines and neutralize the Allies' huge logistical advantage.\\r\\nScreenwriter Bernard Gordon claims to have rewritten John Melson's original screenplay.[3] Some of the original choices for director were Richard Fleischer, who turned it down and Edward Dmytryk, with whom Jack L. Warner of Warner Bros. refused to work.[4] Technical advisor on the film was Maj. Gen. (then Col.) Meinrad von Lauchert, who commanded the German tank division that made the most headway in the actual battle.\\r\\nFor an economical price and with no restrictions, the Spanish army provided an estimated 500 fully equipped soldiers and 75 tanks and vehicles, some of World War II vintage.[5]\\r\\nFormer U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower came out of retirement and held a press conference to denounce the film for what he considered its gross historical inaccuracy.[6]\\r\\nThe film was one of the most popular movies at the British box office in 1966.[7]\\r\\nThe original VHS release of the film for home video use was heavily edited to fit in one VHS tape (to reduce costs to the consumer) and used a full screen \\"pan and scan\\" technique often employed in network telecasts of widescreen motion pictures. The 1992 Laserdisc and 2005 DVD releases, however, run at their full length and are presented letterboxed in the original 2.76:1 aspect ratio. A Blu-ray release followed in 2007, though the aspect ratio says it is 2.35:1 on the back of the cover, the actual aspect ratio of the film is the original 2.76:1 like the previous DVD release. A more recent Blu-ray release states the correct aspect ratio.","input":"What tanks were used in the battle of the bulge movie?"},{"output":"Tonsils","context":"Tonsils are collections of lymphoid tissue[1] facing into the aerodigestive tract. The set of lymphatic tissue known as Waldeyer's tonsillar ring includes the adenoid tonsil, two tubal tonsils, two palatine tonsils, and the lingual tonsil.\\r\\nWhen used unqualified, the term most commonly refers specifically to the palatine tonsils, which are masses of lymphatic material situated at either side of the back of the human throat. The palatine tonsils and the nasopharyngeal tonsil are lymphoepithelial tissues located near the oropharynx and nasopharynx (parts of the throat).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTonsils in humans include, from anterior (front), superior (top), posterior (back), and inferior (bottom):\\r\\nNormally, each tonsil measures up to 2.5 cm in length, 2.0 cm in width and 1.2 cm in thickness.[3]\\r\\nTonsils tend to reach their largest size near puberty, and they gradually undergo atrophy thereafter. However, they are largest relative to the diameter of the throat in young children.\\r\\nThese immunocompetent tissues are the immune system's first line of defense against ingested or inhaled foreign pathogens, and as such frequently engorge with blood to assist in immune responses to common illnesses such as the common cold. Tonsils have on their surface specialized antigen capture cells called M cells that allow for the uptake of antigens produced by pathogens. These M cells then alert the underlying B cells and T cells in the tonsil that a pathogen is present and an immune response is stimulated.[4] B cells are activated and proliferate in areas called germinal centres in the tonsil. These germinal centres are places where B memory cells are created and secretory antibody (IgA) is produced.\\r\\nRecent studies have provided evidence that the tonsils produce T lymphocytes, also known as T-cells, in a manner similar to, but different from, the way the thymus does.[5]\\r\\nTonsils can become enlarged (adenotonsillar hyperplasia) or inflamed (tonsillitis) and may require surgical removal (tonsillectomy). This may be indicated if they obstruct the airway or interfere with swallowing, or in patients with frequent recurrent tonsillitis. However, different mechanisms of pathogenesis for these two subtypes of tonsillar hypertrophy have been described,[6] and may have different responses to identical therapeutic efforts. In older patients, asymmetric tonsils (also known as asymmetric tonsil hypertrophy) may be an indicator of virally infected tonsils, or tumors such as lymphoma or squamous cell carcinoma.\\r\\nTonsillitis is a disorder in which the tonsils are inflamed (sore and swollen). The most common way to treat it is with anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, or if bacterial in origin, antibiotics, e.g. amoxicillin and azithromycin. Often severe and/or recurrent tonsillitis is treated by tonsillectomy.[7][8]\\r\\nA tonsillolith is material that accumulates on the tonsil. They can range up to the size of a peppercorn and are white/cream in color. The main substance is mostly calcium, but they have a strong unpleasant odor because of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan and other chemicals.[citation needed]\\r\\nTonsil enlargement can affect speech, making it hypernasal and giving it the sound of velopharyngeal incompetence (when space in the mouth is not fully separated from the nose's air space).[9] Tonsil size may have a more significant impact on upper airway obstruction for obese children than for those of average weight.[10]\\r\\nAs mucosal lymphatic tissue of the aerodigestive tract, the tonsils are viewed in some classifications as belonging to both the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Other viewpoints treat them (and the spleen and thymus) as large lymphatic organs contradistinguished from the smaller tissue loci of GALT and MALT.\\r\\nIllustration of frontal view of tonsils","input":"What is the largest of the lymphoid tissue found in the pharynx?"},{"output":"a mountain range covering about a quarter of the state of New Hampshire and a small portion of western Maine in the United States","context":"The White Mountains are a mountain range covering about a quarter of the state of New Hampshire and a small portion of western Maine in the United States. They are part of the northern Appalachian Mountains and the most rugged mountains in New England. The range is heavily visited due to its proximity to Boston and, to a lesser extent, New York City and Montreal.\\r\\nMost of the area is public land, including the White Mountain National Forest and a number of state parks. Its most famous mountain is 6,288-foot (1,917?m) Mount Washington, which is the highest peak in the Northeastern U.S. and for 76 years held the record for fastest surface wind gust in the world (231 miles per hour (372?km/h) in 1934). Mount Washington is part of a line of summits, the Presidential Range, that are named after U.S. presidents and other prominent Americans.\\r\\nThe White Mountains also include the Franconia Range, Sandwich Range, Carter-Moriah Range and Kinsman Range in New Hampshire, and the Mahoosuc Range straddling the border between it and Maine. In all, there are 48 peaks within New Hampshire as well as one (Old Speck Mountain) in Maine over 4,000 feet (1,200?m), known as the Four-thousand footers.\\r\\nThe Whites are known for a system of alpine huts for hikers operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club. The Appalachian Trail crosses the area from southwest to northeast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not clear where the name \\"White Mountains\\" came from. There is no record of what Native Americans called the range, although pre-Colonial names for many individual peaks are known.[1] The name and similar ones such as \\"White Hills\\" or \\"Wine Hills\\" are found in literature from Colonial times. According to tradition, the mountains were first sighted from shipboard off the coast near the Piscataqua estuary. The highest peaks would often be snow-capped, appearing white. An alternate theory is that the mica-laden granite of the summits looked white to observers.\\r\\nThe White Mountains are a physiographic section of the larger New England province, which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division.[2]\\r\\nThe magma intrusions forming the White Mountains today were created 124 to 100 million years ago as the North American Plate moved westward over the New England hotspot.\\r\\nWidespread evidence of glaciation may be seen in the U-shaped form of various notches, or mountain passes. Glacial cirques form the heads of Tuckerman Ravine on Mt. Washington and King Ravine on Mt. Adams. Glacial striations are visible at numerous locations, including on the exposed rocks at the summit of Pine Mountain in Gorham.\\r\\nThe Mount Washington Auto Road and the historic Mount Washington Cog Railway ascend the range's highest peak. Heavily visited Arethusa Falls, the second tallest waterfall in New Hampshire, lies on a southwest flank of Crawford Notch. The Old Man of the Mountain, a rock formation on Cannon Mountain that resembled the craggy profile of a man's face, was a White Mountain landmark until it fell in May 2003. It remains the state symbol of New Hampshire. The range also includes a natural feature dubbed \\"The Basin\\", consisting of a granite bowl, 20 feet (6?m) in diameter, fed by a waterfall, worn smooth by the Pemigewasset River. The areas around The Basin are popular spots for swimming in the ice-cold mountain-fed water.\\r\\nThe range is crossed northÿsouth by U.S. Route 3 and Interstate 93 through Franconia Notch and New Hampshire Route 16 through Pinkham Notch, and eastÿwest by the Kancamagus Highway (part of New Hampshire Route 112) through Kancamagus Pass and U.S. Route 302 through Crawford Notch.\\r\\nSome of the earliest maps of the White Mountains were produced as tourist maps and not topographical maps. One of the first two tourist maps of the mountains was that produced by Franklin Leavitt, a self-taught artist born near Lancaster, New Hampshire in 1824.[3] Leavitt's hand-drawn map, today in the collection of Harvard University, is largely folk art, but does convey some of the region's features.[4] Leavitt drew several versions of his map, beginning in 1852. The fourth version, printed in 1871, was printed at Boston and carried a retail price of one dollar.[5] Other early maps of the region were drawn by H. Conant and by Harvard astronomer George Phillips Bond, who published the first topographical map of the region in 1853.[6]\\r\\nAs the most ruggedly picturesque area in the northeast U.S.,[citation needed] the White Mountains drew hundreds of painters during the 19th century. This group of artists is sometimes referred to as belonging to the \\"White Mountain school\\" of art. Others dispute the notion that these painters were a \\"school\\", since they did not all paint in the same style as, for example, those artists of the Hudson River School.\\r\\nNathaniel Hawthorne chose the White Mountains as the setting for his short story, \\"The Great Carbuncle\\". Other White Mountain tales by Hawthorne include \\"The Ambitious Guest\\", \\"Sketches from Memory\\" and \\"The Great Stone Face\\".

It is located in the western Pacific Ocean, an average of 200 kilometres (124?mi) to the east of the Mariana Islands, in the Western Pacific East of Philippines. It is a crescent-shaped scar in the Earth's crust, and measures about 2,550?km (1,580?mi) long and 69?km (43?mi) wide on average. It reaches a maximum-known depth of 10,994 metres (36,070?ft) (I 40 metres [130?ft]) at a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep, at its southern end,[2] although some unrepeated measurements place the deepest portion at 11,034 metres (36,201?ft).[3] For comparison - if Mount Everest were dropped into the trench at this point, its peak would still be over 1.6 kilometres (1?mi) underwater. In 2009, Marianas Trench was established as a United States National Monument[4].\\r\\nAt the bottom of the trench the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bars (15,750?psi), more than 1,000 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%, so that 95 litres of water under the pressure of the Challenger Deep would contain the same mass as 100 litres at the surface. The temperature at the top is 1 to 4?C (34 to 39?F).[5]\\r\\nThe trench is not the part of the seafloor closest to the center of the Earth. This is because the Earth is not a perfect sphere; its radius is about 25 kilometres (16?mi) less at the poles than at the equator.[6] As a result, parts of the Arctic Ocean seabed are at least 13 kilometres (8.1?mi) closer to the Earth's center than the Challenger Deep seafloor.\\r\\nXenophyophores have been found in the trench by Scripps Institution of Oceanography researchers at a record depth of 10.6 kilometres (6.6?mi) below the sea surface.[7] On 17 March 2013, researchers reported data that suggested microbial life forms thrive within the trench.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mariana Trench is named for the nearby Mariana Islands (in turn named Las Marianas in honor of Spanish Queen Mariana of Austria, widow of Philip IV of Spain). The islands are part of the island arc that is formed on an over-riding plate, called the Mariana Plate (also named for the islands), on the western side of the trench.\\r\\nThe Mariana Trench is part of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction system that forms the boundary between two tectonic plates. In this system, the western edge of one plate, the Pacific Plate, is subducted (i.e., thrust) beneath the smaller Mariana Plate that lies to the west. Crustal material at the western edge of the Pacific Plate is some of the oldest oceanic crust on earth (up to 170 million years old), and is therefore cooler and more dense; hence its great height difference relative to the higher-riding (and younger) Mariana Plate. The deepest area at the plate boundary is the Mariana Trench proper.\\r\\nThe movement of the Pacific and Mariana plates is also indirectly responsible for the formation of the Mariana Islands. These volcanic islands are caused by flux melting of the upper mantle due to release of water that is trapped in minerals of the subducted portion of the Pacific Plate.\\r\\nThe trench was first sounded during the Challenger expedition in 1875, using a weighted rope, which recorded a depth of 4,475 fathoms (8,184 metres; 26,850 feet).[10] In 1877, a map was published called Tiefenkarte des Grossen Ozeans (\\"Deep map of the Great Ocean\\") by Petermann, which showed a Challenger Tief (\\"Challenger deep\\") at the location of that sounding. In 1899, USS Nero, a converted collier, recorded a depth of 5,269 fathoms (9,636 metres; 31,614 feet).[11]\\r\\nIn 1951, Challenger II surveyed the trench using echo sounding, a much more precise and vastly easier way to measure depth than the sounding equipment and drag lines used in the original expedition. During this survey, the deepest part of the trench was recorded when the Challenger II measured a depth of 5,960 fathoms (10,900 metres; 35,760 feet) at 1119N 14215E? / ?11.317N 142.250E? / 11.317; 142.250, known as the Challenger Deep.[12]\\r\\nIn 1957, the Soviet vessel Vityaz reported a depth of 11,034 metres (36,201?ft) at a location dubbed the Mariana Hollow.[3]\\r\\nIn 1962, the surface ship M.V. Spencer F. Baird recorded a maximum depth of 10,915 metres (35,810?ft) using precision depth gauges.\\r\\nIn 1984, the Japanese survey vessel Takuy (r) collected data from the Mariana Trench using a narrow, multi-beam echo sounder; it reported a maximum depth of 10,924 metres (35,840?ft), also reported as 10,920 metres (35,830?ft) I10?m (33?ft).[13] Remotely Operated Vehicle KAIKO reached the deepest area of the Mariana trench and made the deepest diving record of 10,911 metres (35,797?ft) on March 24, 1995.[14]\\r\\nDuring surveys carried out between 1997 and 2001, a spot was found along the Mariana Trench that had depth similar to that of the Challenger Deep, possibly even deeper. It was discovered while scientists from the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology were completing a survey around Guam; they used a sonar mapping system towed behind the research ship to conduct the survey. This new spot was named the HMRG (Hawaii Mapping Research Group) Deep, after the group of scientists who discovered it.[15]\\r\\nOn 1 June 2009, sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the Simrad EM120 sonar multibeam bathymetry system for deep water, mapping aboard the RV Kilo Moana (mothership of the Nereus vehicle), indicated a spot with a depth of 10,971 metres (35,994?ft). The sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection, with an accuracy of better than 0.2% of water depth across the entire swath (implying that the depth figure is accurate to I 22 metres (72?ft)).[16][17]\\r\\nIn 2011, it was announced at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting that a US Navy hydrographic ship equipped with a multibeam echosounder conducted a survey which mapped the entire trench to 100 metres (330?ft) resolution.[2] The mapping revealed the existence of four rocky outcrops thought to be former seamounts.[18]\\r\\nThe Mariana Trench is a site chosen by researchers at Washington University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 2012 for a seismic survey to investigate the subsurface water cycle. Using both ocean-bottom seismometers and hydrophones the scientists are able to map structures as deep as 97 kilometres (60?mi) beneath the surface.[19]\\r\\nFour descents have been achieved. The first was the manned descent by Swiss-designed, Italian-built, United States Navy-owned bathyscaphe Trieste which reached the bottom at 1:06?pm on 23 January 1960, with Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard on board.[12][21] Iron shot was used for ballast, with gasoline for buoyancy.[12] The onboard systems indicated a depth of 11,521 m (37,799?ft), but this was later revised to 10,916 m (35,814?ft).[22] The depth was estimated from a conversion of pressure measured and calculations based on the water density from sea surface to seabed.[21]\\r\\nThis was followed by the unmanned ROVs Kaik in 1996 and Nereus in 2009. The first three expeditions directly measured very similar depths of 10,902 to 10,916?m (35,768 to 35,814?ft). The fourth was made by Canadian film director James Cameron in 2012. On 26 March, he reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the submersible vessel Deepsea Challenger.[23][24][25]\\r\\nIn July 2015, members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oregon State University, and the Coast Guard submerged a hydrophone into the deepest part of the Mariana Trench, the Challenger Deep, never having deployed one past a mile. The titanium-shelled hydrophone was designed to withstand the immense pressure 7 miles under.[26] Although researchers were unable to retrieve the hydrophone until November, the data capacity was full within the first 23 days. After months of analyzing the sounds, the experts were surprised to pick up natural and man-made sounds such as boats, earthquakes, a typhoon, and baleen whales.[27] Due to the mission's success, the researchers announced plans to deploy a second hydrophone in 2017 for an extended period of time.\\r\\nAs of February 2012, at least two other teams are planning piloted submarines to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Triton Submarines, a Florida-based company that designs and manufactures private submarines, plans for a crew of three to take 120 minutes to reach the seabed.[28] DOER Marine, a marine technology company based near San Francisco and set up in 1992, plans for a crew of two or three to take 90 minutes to reach the seabed.[29]\\r\\nThe expedition conducted in 1960 claimed to have observed, with great surprise because of the high pressure, large creatures living at the bottom, such as a flatfish about 30?cm (12?in) long,[22] and shrimp.[30] According to Piccard, \\"The bottom appeared light and clear, a waste of firm diatomaceous ooze\\".[22] Many marine biologists are now skeptical of the supposed sighting of the flatfish, and it is suggested that the creature may instead have been a sea cucumber.[31][32] During the second expedition, the unmanned vehicle Kaik collected mud samples from the seabed.[33] Tiny organisms were found to be living in those samples.\\r\\nIn July 2011, a research expedition deployed untethered landers, called dropcams, equipped with digital video and lights to explore this region of the deep sea. Amongst many other living organisms, some gigantic single-celled amoebas with a size of more than 10?cm (4?in), belonging to the class of xenophyophores were observed.[34] Xenophyophores are noteworthy for their size, their extreme abundance on the seafloor and their role as hosts for a variety of organisms.\\r\\nIn December 2014, a new species of snailfish was discovered at a depth of 8,145?m (26,722?ft), breaking the previous record for the deepest living fish seen on video.[35]\\r\\nDuring the 2014 expedition, several new species were filmed including huge crustaceans known as supergiants. Deep-sea gigantism is the process where species grow larger than their shallow water relatives.[35]\\r\\nIn May 2017 an unidentified type of snailfish was filmed at a depth of 8,178 metres (26,800?ft).[36]\\r\\nIn 2016, a research expedition looked at the chemical makeup of crustacean scavengers collected from a range of 7,841ÿ10,250 metres within the trench. Within these organisms, the researchers found extremely elevated concentrations of PCBs, a chemical toxin banned for its environmental harm in the 1970s, concentrated at all depths within the sediment of the trench.[37]\\r\\nLike other oceanic trenches, the Mariana Trench has been proposed as a site for nuclear waste disposal,[38][39] in the hope that tectonic plate subduction occurring at the site might eventually push the nuclear waste deep into the Earth's mantle, the second layer of the Earth. However, ocean dumping of nuclear waste is prohibited by international law.[38][39][40] Furthermore, plate subduction zones are associated with very large megathrust earthquakes, the effects of which are unpredictable for the safety of long-term disposal of nuclear wastes within the hadopelagic ecosystem.[39]","input":"What is the deepest depth in the oceans?"},{"output":"14 January 1761","context":" Durrani Empire\\r\\nThe Third Battle of Panipat took place on 14 January 1761 at Panipat, about 60 miles (97?km) north of Delhi, between a northern expeditionary force of the Maratha Empire and invading forces of the King of Afghanistan, Ahmad Shah Abdali, supported by two Indian alliesthe Rohilla Afghans of the Doab, and Shuja-ud-Daula, the Nawab of Awadh. Militarily, the battle pitted the artillery and cavalry of the Marathas against the heavy cavalry and mounted artillery (zamburak and jezail) of the Afghans and Rohillas led by Abdali and Najib-ud-Daulah, both ethnic Afghans. The battle is considered one of the largest and most eventful fought in the 18th century,[5][page?needed] and has perhaps the largest number of fatalities in a single day reported in a classic formation battle between two armies.\\r\\nThe specific site of the battle itself is disputed by historians, but most consider it to have occurred somewhere near modern-day Kaalaa Aamb and Sanauli Road. The battle lasted for several days and involved over 125,000 troops. Protracted skirmishes occurred, with losses and gains on both sides. The forces led by Ahmad Shah Durrani came out victorious after destroying several Maratha flanks. The extent of the losses on both sides is heavily disputed by historians, but it is believed that between 60,000ÿ70,000 were killed in fighting, while the numbers of injured and prisoners taken vary considerably. According to the single best eyewitness chroniclethe bakhar by Shuja-ud-Daulah's Diwan Kashi Rajabout 40,000 Maratha prisoners were slaughtered in cold blood the day after the battle.[4] Grant Duff includes an interview of a survivor of these massacres in his History of the Marathas and generally corroborates this number. Shejwalkar, whose monograph Panipat 1761 is often regarded as the single best secondary source on the battle, says that \\"not less than 100,000 Marathas (soldiers and non-combatants) perished during and after the battle.\\"[3]\\r\\nThe result of the battle was the halting of further Maratha advances in the north, and a destabilisation of their territories, for roughly ten years. This period is marked by the rule of Peshwa Madhavrao, who is credited with the revival of Maratha domination following the defeat at Panipat. In 1771, ten years after Panipat, he sent a large Maratha army into northern India in an expedition that was meant to re-establish Maratha domination in that area and punish refractory powers that had either sided with the Afghans, such as the Rohillas, or had shaken off Maratha domination after Panipat. The success of this campaign can be seen as the last chapter of the long story of Panipat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe decline of the Mughal Empire following the 27-year Mughal-Maratha war (1680ÿ1707) led to rapid territorial gains for the Maratha Empire. Under Peshwa Baji Rao, Gujarat, Malwa and Rajputana came under Maratha control. Finally, in 1737, Baji Rao defeated the Mughals on the outskirts of Delhi and brought much of the former Mughal territories south of Delhi under Maratha control. Baji Rao's son Balaji Baji Rao further increased the territory under Maratha control by invading Punjab in 1758. This brought the Marathas into direct confrontation with the Durrani empire of Ahmad Shah Abdali (also known as Ahmad Shah Durrani). In 1759 he raised an army from the Pashtun and Baloch tribes and made several gains against the smaller Maratha garrisons in Punjab. He then joined with his Indian alliesthe Rohilla Afghans of the Gangetic Doabforming a broad coalition against the Marathas. The Marathas, under the command of Sadashivrao Bhau, responded by gathering an army of between 45,000ÿ60,000, which was accompanied by roughly 200,000 non-combatants, a number of whom were pilgrims desirous of making pilgrimages to Hindu holy sites in northern India. The Marathas started their northward journey from Patdur on 14 March 1760. Both sides tried to get the Nawab of Awadh, Shuja-ud-Daulah, into their camp. By late July Shuja-ud-Daulah made the decision to join the Afghan-Rohilla coalition, preferring to join what was perceived as the \\"army of Islam\\". This was strategically a major loss for the Marathas, since Shuja provided much-needed finances for the long Afghan stay in North India. It is doubtful whether the Afghan-Rohilla coalition would have the means to continue their conflict with the Marathas without Shuja's support.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Marathas had gained control of a considerable part of India in the intervening period (1707ÿ1757). In 1758 they occupied Delhi, captured Lahore and drove out Timur Shah Durrani,[6] the son and viceroy of the Afghan ruler, Ahmad Shah Abdali. This was the high-water mark of the Maratha expansion, where the boundaries of their empire extended in the north to the Indus and the Himalayas, and in the south nearly to the extremity of the peninsula. This territory was ruled through the Peshwa, who talked of placing his son Vishwasrao on the Mughal throne. However, Delhi still remained under the nominal control of Mughals, key Muslim intellectuals including Shah Waliullah and other Muslim clergy in India who were alarmed at these developments. In desperation they appealed to Ahmad Shah Abdali, the ruler of Afghanistan, to halt the threat.[citation needed]\\r\\n[7]\\r\\nIn the final phase the Marathas, under Scindia, attacked Najib. Najib successfully fought a defensive action, however, keeping Scindia's forces at bay. By noon it looked as though Bhau would clinch victory for the Marathas once again. The Afghan left flank still held its own, but the centre was cut in two and the right was almost destroyed. Ahmad Shah had watched the fortunes of the battle from his tent, guarded by the still unbroken forces on his left. He sent his bodyguards to call up his 15,000 reserve troops from his camp and arranged them as a column in front of his cavalry of musketeers (Qizilbash) and 2,000 swivel-mounted shutarnaals or Ushtranaalcannonson the backs of camels.[8][page?needed]\\r\\nSadashivrao Bhau, seeing his forward lines dwindling and civilians behind, had not kept any reserves, and upon seeing Vishwasrao disappear in the midst of the fighting, he felt he had no choice but to come down from his elephant and lead the battle.[6]\\r\\nVishwasrao had already been killed by a shot to the head. Bhau and his loyal bodyguards fought to the end, the Maratha leader having three horses shot out from under him. At this stage Holkar, realising the battle was lost, broke from the Maratha left flank and retreated. The Maratha army was routed and fled under the devastating attack. While 15,000 soldiers managed to reach Gwalior, the rest of the Maratha forcesincluding large numbers of non-combatantswere either killed or captured.[6]\\r\\nDurrani had both numeric as well as qualitative superiority over Marathas. The combined Afghan army was much larger than that of Marathas. Though the infantry of Marathas was organized along European lines and their army had some of the best French-made guns of the time, their artillery was static and lacked mobility against the fast-moving Afghan forces. The heavy mounted artillery of Afghans proved much better in the battlefield than the light artillery of Marathas.[9][page?needed]\\r\\nMoreover, the senior Maratha chiefs constantly bickered with one another. Each had ambitions of carving out their independent states and had no interest in fighting against a common enemy.[10] Some of them didn't support the idea of a round battle and wanted to fight using guerilla tactics instead of charging the enemy head-on.[citation needed] The Marathas were fighting alone at a place which was 1000 miles away from their capital Pune.[11]\\r\\nPeshwa's decision to appoint Sadashivrao Bhau as the Supreme Commander instead of Malharrao Holkar or Raghunathrao proved to be an unfortunate one, as Sadashivrao was totally ignorant of the political and military situation in North India.[12]\\r\\nIf Holkar had remained in the battlefield, the Maratha defeat would have been delayed but not averted. Ahmad Shahs superiority in pitched battle could have been negated if the Marathas had conducted their traditional ganimi kava, or guerrilla warfare, as advised by Malharrao Holkar, in Punjab and in north India. Abdali was in no position to maintain his field army in India indefinitely.[13]\\r\\nThe Afghan cavalry and pikemen ran wild through the streets of Panipat, killing tens of thousands of Maratha soldiers and civilians.[3][4] The women and children seeking refuge in streets of Panipat were hounded back in Afghan camps as slaves. Children over 14 were beheaded before their own mothers and sisters. Afghan officers who had lost their kin in battle were permitted to carry out massacres of 'infidel' Hindus the next day also, in Panipat and the surrounding area.[14] They arranged victory mounds of severed heads outside their camps. According to the single best eye-witness chronicle ÿ the bakhar by Shuja-ud-Daula's Diwan Kashi Raj ÿ about 40,000 Maratha prisoners were slaughtered in cold blood the day after the battle.[3][4] According to Mr. Hamilton of Bombay Gazette about half a million Marathi people were present there in Panipat town and he gives a figure of 40,000 prisoners as executed by Afghans.[citation needed] Many of the fleeing Maratha women jumped into the Panipat wells rather than risk rape and dishonour.[14]\\r\\nAll of the prisoners were transported on bullock carts, camels and elephants in bamboo cages.[14]\\r\\nSiyar-ut-Mutakhirin says:[14][full citation needed]\\r\\nThe bodies of Vishwasrao and Bhau were recovered by the Marathas and were cremated according to their custom.[15] Bhau's wife Parvatibai was saved by Holkar, per the directions of Bhau, and eventually returned to Pune.\\r\\nPeshwa Balaji Baji Rao, uninformed about the state of his army, was crossing the Narmada with reinforcements when he heard of the defeat. He returned to Pune and never recovered from the shock of the debacle at Panipat.[6]\\r\\nJankoji Scindia was taken prisoner and executed at the instigation of Najib. Ibrahim Khan Gardi was tortured and executed by enraged Afghan soldiers.[15] The Marathas never fully recovered from the loss at Panipat, but they remained the predominant military power in India and managed to retake Delhi 10 years later. However, their claim over all of India ended with the three Anglo-Maratha Wars, almost 50 years after Panipat.[16]\\r\\nThe Jats under Suraj Mal benefited significantly from not participating in the Battle of Panipat. They provided considerable assistance to the Maratha soldiers and civilians who escaped the fighting. Suraj Mal himself was killed in battle against Najib-ud-Daula in 1763. Suraj Mal died on 25 December 1763 fighting the Rohillas under Najib, the very people against whom he could have helped the Marathas.[citation needed]\\r\\nAhmad Shah's victory left him, in the short term, the undisputed master of North India. However, his alliance quickly unravelled amidst squabbles between his generals and other princes, the increasing restlessness of his soldiers over pay, the increasing Indian heat and arrival of the news that Marathas had organised another 100,000 men in the south to avenge their loss and rescue captured prisoners.[citation needed]\\r\\nThough Abdali won the battle, he also had heavy casualties on his side. So, he sought peace with the Marathas.\\r\\nThese circumstances forced Abdali to leave India at the earliest, never to return again. Before departing, he ordered the Indian chiefs, through a Royal Firman (order) (including Clive of India), to recognise Shah Alam II as Emperor.[17]\\r\\nAhmad Shah also appointed Najib-ud-Daula as ostensible regent to the Mughal Emperor. In addition, Najib and Munir-ud-daulah agreed to pay to Abdali, on behalf of the Mughal king, an annual tribute of four million rupees.[17] This was to be Ahmad Shah's final major expedition to North India, as he became increasingly preoccupied with the increasingly successful rebellions by the Sikhs.[18][page?needed] Abdali, haven't had achieved much from the battle of Panipat, died soon after on 16 October 1772 in Kandahar Province.\\r\\nShah Shuja was to regret his decision to join the Afghan forces. In time his forces became embroiled in clashes between the orthodox Sunni Afghans and his own Shia followers. He is alleged to have later secretly sent letters to Bhausaheb through his spies regretting his decision to join Abdali.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter the Battle of Panipat the services of the Rohillas were rewarded by grants of Shikohabad to Nawab Faiz-ullah Khan and of Jalesar and Firozabad to Nawab Sadullah Khan. Najib Khan proved to be an effective ruler. However, after his death in 1770, the Rohillas were defeated by the British East India Company.[citation needed] Najib died on 30 October 1770.[19]\\r\\nThe valour displayed by the Marathas was praised by Ahmad Shah Abdali.[20]\\r\\nThe Third Battle of Panipat saw an enormous number of deaths and injuries in a single day of battle. It was the last major battle between indigenous South Asian military powers until the creation of Pakistan and India in 1947.\\r\\nTo save their kingdom, the Mughals once again changed sides and welcomed the Afghans to Delhi. The Mughals remained in nominal control over small areas of India, but were never a force again. The empire officially ended in 1857 when its last emperor, Bahadur Shah II, was accused of being involved in the Sepoy Mutiny and exiled.\\r\\nThe Marathas' expansion was delayed due to the battle, and infighting soon broke out within the empire. They recovered their position under the next Peshwa Madhavrao I and by 1771 were back in control of the north, finally occupying Delhi. However, after the death of Madhavrao, due to infighting and increasing pressure from the British, their claims to empire only officially ended in 1818 after three wars with the British.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Sikhswhose rebellion was the original reason Ahmad invadedwere left largely untouched by the battle. They soon retook Lahore. When Ahmad Shah returned in March 1764 he was forced to break off his siege after only two weeks due to a rebellion in Afghanistan. He returned again in 1767, but was unable to win any decisive battle. With his own troops complaining about not being paid, he eventually abandoned the district to the Sikhs, who remained in control until 1849 when it was annexed by the British Empire.\\r\\nThe battle was referred to in Rudyard Kipling's poem \\"With Scindia to Delhi\\".\\r\\n\\"Our hands and scarfs were saffron-dyed for signal of despair,\\r\\nWhen we went forth to Paniput to battle with the ~Mlech~,\\r\\nEre we came back from Paniput and left a kingdom there.\\"\\r\\nIt is, however, also remembered as a scene of valour on both sides. Santaji Wagh's corpse was found with over 40 mortal wounds. The bravery of Vishwas Rao, the Peshwa's son, and Sadashiv Bhau was acknowledged even by the Afghans.[21]","input":"When was the third battle of panipat fought?"},{"output":"1 1/2\\"","context":"An ice rink (or ice skating rink) is a frozen body of water and/or hardened chemicals where people can ice skate or play winter sports. Besides recreational ice skating, some of its uses include ice hockey, bandy, rink bandy, ringette, broomball, speed skating, figure skating, ice stock sport and curling as well as exhibitions, contests and ice shows. There are two types of rinks in prevalent use today: natural, where freezing occurs from cold ambient temperatures, and artificial (or mechanically frozen), where a coolant produces cold temperatures in the surface below the water, causing the water to freeze. There are also synthetic ice rinks where skating surfaces are made out of plastics.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRink, a Scottish word meaning 'course', was used as the name of a place where curling was played. The name has been retained for the construction of ice areas for other sports and uses.[1]\\r\\nEarly attempts at the construction of artificial ice rinks were first made in the 'rink mania' of 1841ÿ44. As the technology for the maintenance of natural ice did not exist, these early rinks used a substitute consisting of a mixture of hog's lard and various salts. An item in the 8 May 1844 issue of Eliakim Littell's Living Age headed \\"The Glaciarium\\" reported that \\"This establishment, which has been removed to Grafton street East' Tottenham Court Road, was opened on Monday afternoon. The area of artificial ice is extremely convenient for such as may be desirous of engaging in the graceful and manly pastime of skating\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nBy 1844, these venues fell out of fashion, as customers grew tired of the 'smelly' ice substitute, and it was only thirty years later, that refrigeration technology developed to the point that natural ice could finally be feasibly used in the rink. The world's first mechanically frozen ice rink was the Glaciarium, opened by John Gamgee in a tent in a small building just off the Kings Road in Chelsea, London, on 7 January 1876.[2] In March, it moved to a permanent venue at 379 Kings Road, where a rink measuring 40 by 24 feet (12.2 by 7.3?m) was established.[3]\\r\\nThe rink was based on a concrete surface, with layers of earth, cow hair and timber planks. Atop these were laid oval copper pipes carrying a solution of glycerine with ether, nitrogen peroxide and water. The pipes were covered by water and the solution was pumped through, freezing the water into ice. Gamgee discovered the process while attempting to develop a method to freeze meat for import from Australia and New Zealand, and patented it as early as 1870.[3]\\r\\nGamgee operated the rink on a membership-only basis and attempted to attract a wealthy clientele, experienced in open-air ice skating during winters in the Alps. He installed an orchestra gallery, which could also be used by spectators, and decorated the walls with views of the Swiss Alps.[3]\\r\\nThe rink initially proved a success, and Gamgee opened two further rinks later in the year: at Rusholme in Manchester and the \\"Floating Glaciarium\\" at Charing Cross in London, this last significantly larger at 115 by 25 feet (35.1 by 7.6?m). The Southport Glaciarium opened in 1879, using Gamgee's method.[3]\\r\\nIn Germany, the first ice skating rink opened in 1882 in Frankfurt during a patent exhibition. It covered 520m2 and operated for two months; the refrigeration system was designed by Linde.[4]\\r\\nThe oldest indoor artificial ice rink still in existence (built 1909-10) and in use is the one in Boston's Matthews Arena, on the campus of Northeastern University.[5][6]\\r\\nMany ice rinks consist of, or are found on, open bodies of water such as lakes, ponds, canals, and sometimes rivers; these can only be used in the winter in climates where the surface would freeze thickly enough to support human weight. Rinks can also be made in cold climates by enclosing a level area of ground, filling it with water, and letting it freeze. Snow may even be packed to use as a containment material.\\r\\nA famous example of this type of rink is the Rideau Canal Skateway in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, estimated at 1,782,000 square feet (165,600?m2) and 7.8 kilometres (4.8?mi) long, which is equivalent to 90 Olympic size skating rinks.[7] The rink is prepared by lowering the canal's water level and letting the canal water freeze. The rink is then resurfaced nightly by cleaning the ice of snow and flooding it with water from below the ice. The rink is recognized as the \\"world's largest naturally frozen ice rink\\" by the Guinness Book of World Records because \\"its entire length receives daily maintenance such as sweeping, ice thickness checks and there are toilet and recreational facilities along its entire length\\".[7]\\r\\nThe longest ice skating trail can be found in Invermere, British Columbia, Canada, on Lake Windermere Whiteway. The naturally frozen trail measures 29.98 kilometres (18.63?mi).[8]\\r\\nIn any climate, an arena ice surface can be installed in a properly built space. This consists of a bed of sand or occasionally a slab of concrete, through (or on top of) which pipes run. The pipes carry a chilled fluid (usually either a salt brine or water with antifreeze, or in the case of smaller rinks, refrigerant) which can lower the temperature of the slab so that water placed atop will freeze. This method is known as 'artificial ice' to differentiate from ice rinks made by simply freezing water in a cold climate, indoors or outdoors, although both types are of frozen water. A more proper technical term is 'mechanically frozen' ice.\\r\\nA famous example of this type of rink is the outdoor rink at Rockefeller Center in New York.\\r\\nModern rinks have a specific procedure for preparing the surface. With the pipes cold, a thin layer of water is sprayed on the sand or concrete to seal and level it (or in the case of concrete, to keep it from being marked). This thin layer is painted white or pale blue for better contrast; markings necessary for hockey or curling are also placed, along with logos or other decorations. Another thin layer of water is sprayed on top of this. The ice is built up to a thickness of 3/4ths an inch to 1 1/2 inches.[9] The industry standard in the NHL is around 1 1/2\\".\\r\\nSynthetic rinks are constructed from a solid polymer material designed for skating using normal metal-bladed ice skates. High density polyethelene (HDPE) and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW) are the only materials that offer reasonable skating characteristics, with UHMW synthetic rinks offering the most ice-like skating but also being the most expensive. A typical synthetic rink will consist of many panels of thin surface material assembled on top of a sturdy, level and smooth sub-floor (anything from concrete to wood or even dirt or grass) to create a large skating area.\\r\\nPeriodically after the ice has been used, it is resurfaced using a machine called an ice resurfacer (sometimes colloquially referred to as a Zamboni ÿ who are a major manufacturer of such machinery). For curling, the surface is 'pebbled' by allowing loose drops of cold water to fall onto the ice and freeze into rounded peaks.\\r\\nBetween events, especially if the arena is being used without need for the ice surface, it is either covered with a heavily insulated floor or melted by allowing the fluid in the pipes below the ice to warm.\\r\\nA highly specialized form of rink is used for speed skating; this is a large oval (or ring) much like an athletic track. Because of their limited use, speed skating ovals are found in much fewer numbers than the more common hockey or curling rinks.\\r\\nThose skilled at preparing arena ice are often in demand for major events where ice quality is critical. The popularity of the sport of hockey in Canada has led its icemakers to be particularly sought after. One such team of professionals was responsible for placing a loonie coin under center ice at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah; as both Canadian teams (men's and women's) won their respective hockey gold medals, the coin was christened \\"lucky\\" and is now in the possession of the Hockey Hall of Fame[10] after having been retrieved from beneath the ice.\\r\\nIn bandy, the rink size is 90ÿ110?m (300ÿ360?ft) x 45ÿ65?m (148ÿ213?ft). For internationals, the size must not be smaller than 100 metres (330?ft) x 60 metres (200?ft).\\r\\nThere are basically two rink sizes in use, although there is a great deal of variation in the dimensions of actual ice rinks. Historically, earlier ice rinks were smaller than today.\\r\\nOfficial National Hockey League rinks are 26?m G?61?m (85?ft G?200?ft). The dimensions originate from the size of the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Official Olympic/International rinks have dimensions of 30?m G?60?m (98.4?ft G?197?ft).\\r\\nIn speed skating, for short track, the official Olympic rink size is 30 x 60 meters, with an oval ice track of 111.12 meters in circumference. In long track speed skating the oval ice track is usually 400 meters in circumference.","input":"How deep is ice in a hockey rink?"},{"output":"southeastern and central United States","context":"The corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus) is a North American species of rat snake that subdues its small prey by constriction.[4][5] It is found throughout the southeastern and central United States. Their docile nature, reluctance to bite, moderate adult size, attractive pattern, and comparatively simple care make them popular pet snakes. Though superficially resembling the venomous copperhead and often killed as a result of this mistaken identity, corn snakes are harmless and beneficial to humans.[6] Corn snakes lack functional venom and help control populations of wild rodent pests that damage crops and spread disease.[7]\\r\\nThe corn snake is named for the species' regular presence near grain stores, where it preys on mice and rats that eat harvested corn.[8] The Oxford English Dictionary cites this usage as far back as 1675. Some sources maintain that the corn snake is so-named because the distinctive, nearly-checkered pattern of the snake's belly scales resembles the kernels of variegated corn.[9][10] Regardless of the name's origin, the corn reference can be a useful mnemonic for identifying corn snakes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdult corn snakes have a body length of 61ÿ182 centimetres (2.00ÿ5.97?ft).[11] In the wild, they usually live around 6ÿ8 years, but in captivity can live to an age of 23 years or more.[12] They can be distinguished from Copperhead snakes by their brighter colors, slender build, round pupils and lack of heat-sensing pits.[13]\\r\\nUntil 2002, the corn snake was considered to have two subspecies: the nominate subspecies (Pantherophis guttatus guttatus) described here and the Great Plains rat snake (Pantherophis guttatus emoryi). The Great Plains rat snake has since been split off as its own species (Pantherophis emoryi), but is still occasionally treated as a subspecies of the corn snake by hobbyists.\\r\\nIt has been suggested that Pantherophis guttatus can be split into three species: Pantherophis guttatus, Pantherophis emoryi (corresponding with the subspecies Pantherophis guttatus emoryi) and Pantherophis slowinskii (occurring in western Louisiana and adjacent Texas).[14]\\r\\nPantherophis guttatus was previously placed in the genus Elaphe, but Elaphe was found to be paraphyletic by Utiger et al., leading to placement of this species in the genus Pantherophis.[15] The placement of Pantherophis guttatus and several related species in Pantherophis rather than Elaphe has been confirmed by further phylogenetic studies.[16][17] Many reference materials still use the synonym Elaphe guttata.[18] Molecular data has shown that corn snakes are actually more closely related to king snakes (genus Lampropeltis) than they are to the Old World rat snakes with which they were formerly classified. Corn snakes have even been bred in captivity with California king snakes to produce fertile hybrids known as \\"Jungle corn snakes\\".[19]\\r\\nWild corn snakes prefer habitats such as overgrown fields, forest openings, trees, palmetto flatwoods and abandoned or seldom-used buildings and farms, from sea level to as high as 6,000?feet. Typically, these snakes remain on the ground until the age of 4 months old but can ascend trees, cliffs and other elevated surfaces.[20] They can be found in the southeastern United States ranging from New Jersey to the Florida Keys and as far west as Utah[21].\\r\\nIn colder regions, snakes hibernate during winter. However, in the more temperate climate along the coast they shelter in rock crevices and logs during cold weather, and come out on warm days to soak up the heat of the sun. During cold weather, snakes are less active and therefore hunt less.\\r\\nCorn snakes are relatively easy to breed. Although not necessary, they are usually put through a cooling (also known as brumation) period that takes 60ÿ90 days. This is to get them ready for breeding and to tell them that its time to reproduce. Corns brumate at around 10 to 16?C (50 to 61?F) in a place where they can not be disturbed and with little sunlight.\\r\\nCorn snakes usually breed shortly after the winter cooling. The male courts the female primarily with tactile and chemical cues, then everts one of his hemipenes, inserts it into the female, and ejaculates his sperm. If the female is ovulating, the eggs will be fertilized, and she will begin sequestering nutrients into the eggs, then secreting a shell.\\r\\nEgg-laying occurs slightly more than a month after mating, with 12ÿ24 eggs deposited into a warm, moist, hidden location. Once laid the adult snake abandons the eggs and does not return to them. The eggs are oblong with a leathery, flexible shell. Approximately 10 weeks after laying, the young snakes use a specialized scale called an egg tooth to slice slits in the egg shell, from which they emerge at about 5?inches in length.\\r\\nLike all snakes, corn snakes are carnivorous, and in the wild they eat every few days. While most corn snakes will eat small rodents, such as the White-footed Mouse, they may also eat reptiles or amphibians, or climb trees to find unguarded bird eggs.[22] Behavioral/chemosensory studies with corn snakes suggest that odor cues are of primary importance for prey detection, whereas visual cues are of secondary importance.[23][24] Like many species of Colubridae, corn snakes exhibit defensive tail vibration behavior.[25]\\r\\nIt has been found that the American \\"rat snakes\\", such as Pantherophis guttatus, had venomous ancestors which lost their venom after they evolved constriction as a means of prey capture.[26]\\r\\nCorn snakes are one of the most popular types of snakes to keep in captivity or as pets. Their size, calm temperament, and ease of care contribute to this popularity. Captive corn snakes tolerate being handled by their owners, even for extended periods.[27] A corn snake's space requirements are low since a 20 to 25-gallon vivarium provides enough room for a fully grown snake. Corn snakes enjoy hiding and burrowing, usually accommodated with a loose substrate (such as Aspen wood shavings or newspaper) and one or more hide boxes.[28] Captive corn snakes are generally fed pre-killed or stunned feeder mice, because captive-bred rodents reduce the risk of pathogens or live prey-induced injuries.[29]\\r\\nAfter many generations of selective breeding, domesticated corn snakes are found in a wide variety of different colors and patterns. These result from recombining the dominant and recessive genes that code for proteins involved in chromatophore development, maintenance, or function. New variations, or morphs, become available every year as breeders gain a better understanding of the genetics involved.\\r\\nThere are tens of thousands of possible compound morphs. Some of the most popular are listed.\\r\\nHybrids between corn snakes and any other snakes is very common within captivity and rarely occurs in the wild. Hybrids within the genera Pantherophis, Lampropeltis, or Pituophis so far have been proven to be completely fertile. There are many different corn snake hybrids bred in captivity. A few common examples include:\\r\\nWhen hybrids of corn snakes are found in the wild they are usually hybridized with other Pantherophis species whose ranges overlap with corn snakes.","input":"Where are corn snakes found in the wild?"},{"output":"\\"Montani Semper Liberi\\", (\\"Mountaineers are Always Free\\"","context":"The Great Seal of the State of West Virginia was adopted in September 1863.[1] The obverse center of the seal contains a boulder that has been inscribed June 20, 1863, the date West Virginia became a state.

The eleventh season is set to premiere on September 25, 2017.[5]\\r\\nThe show is primarily centered on five characters living in Pasadena, California: Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, both physicists at Caltech, who share an apartment; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who later becomes a pharmaceutical representative and who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's similarly geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four men are contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.[6][7]\\r\\nOver time, supporting characters have been promoted to starring roles: Leslie Winkle, a physicist who dated Leonard and Howard; neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler, who joins the group after being matched to Sheldon on a dating website (and later becomes Sheldon's girlfriend); Bernadette Rostenkowski, Howard's wife (previously his girlfriend), a microbiologist and former part-time waitress alongside Penny; Stuart Bloom, the cash-strapped owner of the comic book store the characters often visit; and Emily Sweeney, a dermatologist who dated Raj.\\r\\nThe structure of the original, unaired pilot, developed for the 2006ÿ07 television season, was substantially different from the series' current form. The only characters retained in both pilots were Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons), who are named after Sheldon Leonard, a longtime figure in episodic television as producer, director and actor. Althea (Vernee Watson) was a character featured in both pilots and the first series episode.[8] Two female leads were Canadian actress Amanda Walsh as Katie, \\"a street-hardened, tough-as-nails woman with a vulnerable interior,\\"[9][10] and Iris Bahr as Gilda, a scientist colleague and friend of the male characters. Sheldon and Leonard meet Katie after she breaks up with a boyfriend and they invite her to share their apartment. Gilda is threatened by Katie's presence. Test audiences reacted negatively to Katie, but they liked Sheldon and Leonard. The original pilot used Thomas Dolby's hit \\"She Blinded Me with Science\\" as its theme song.\\r\\nAlthough the show was not picked up, its creators were given an opportunity to retool it and produce a second pilot. They brought in the remaining cast and retooled the show to its final format. Katie was replaced by Penny (Kaley Cuoco). The original unaired pilot never has officially been released, but it has circulated on the Internet. On the evolution of the show, Chuck Lorre said, \\"We did the 'Big Bang Pilot' about two and a half years ago, and it sucked ... but there were two remarkable things that worked perfectly, and that was Johnny and Jim. We rewrote the thing entirely and then we were blessed with Kaley and Simon and Kunal.\\" As to whether the world will ever see the original pilot on a future DVD release, Lorre said, \\"Wow, that would be something.

The reworked second pilot led to a 13-episode order by CBS on May 14, 2007.[12] Prior to its airing on CBS, the pilot episode was distributed on iTunes free of charge. The show premiered on September 24, 2007, and was picked up for a full 22-episode season on October 19, 2007.[13] The show is filmed in front of a live audience,[14] and is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions.[15] Production was halted on November 6, 2007, due to the Writers Guild of America strike. Nearly three months later, on February 4, 2008, the series was temporarily replaced by a short-lived sitcom, Welcome to the Captain. The series returned on March 17, 2008, in an earlier time slot[16] and ultimately only 17 episodes were produced for the first season.[17][18]\\r\\nAfter the strike ended, the show was picked up for a second season, airing in the 2008ÿ2009 season, premiering in the same time slot on September 22, 2008.[19] With increasing ratings, the show received a two-year renewal through the 2010ÿ11 season in 2009.[20][21] In 2011, the show was picked up for three more seasons.[22] In March 2014, the show was renewed again for three more years through the 2016ÿ17 season. This marks the second time the series has gained a three-year renewal.[23] In March 2017, the series was renewed for two additional seasons, bringing its total to 12, and running through the 2018ÿ19 television season.[24]\\r\\nDavid Saltzberg, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles, checks scripts and provides dialogue, mathematics equations, and diagrams used as props.[6] According to executive producer/co-creator Bill Prady, \\"We're working on giving Sheldon an actual problem that he's going to be working on throughout the [first] season so there's actual progress to the boards ... . We worked hard to get all the science right.\\"[7]\\r\\nSeveral of the actors in The Big Bang Theory previously worked together on the sitcom Roseanne, including Johnny Galecki, Sara Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf (who plays Sheldon's mother, Mary Cooper), and Meagen Fay (who plays Bernadette's mother). Additionally, Lorre was a writer on the series for several seasons.\\r\\nThe Canadian alternative rock band Barenaked Ladies wrote and recorded the show's theme song, which describes the history and formation of the universe and the Earth. Co-lead singer Ed Robertson was asked by Lorre and Prady to write a theme song for the show after the producers attended one of the band's concerts in Los Angeles. By coincidence, Robertson had recently read Simon Singh's book Big Bang,[25][26] and at the concert improvised a freestyle rap about the origins of the universe.[citation needed] Lorre and Prady phoned him shortly thereafter and asked him to write the theme song. Having been asked to write songs for other films and shows, but ending up being rejected because of producer's favor of other artist's song, Robertson agreed to write the theme only after learning that Lorre and Prady had not asked anyone else.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn October 9, 2007, a full-length (1 minute and 45 seconds) version of the song was released commercially.[27] Although some sources identify the song title as \\"History of Everything,\\"[28] the cover art for the single identifies the title as \\"Big Bang Theory Theme.\\" A music video also was released via special features on The Complete Fourth Season DVD and Blu-ray set.[29][30] The theme was included on the band's greatest hits album, Hits from Yesterday & the Day Before, released on September 27, 2011.[31] In September 2015, TMZ uncovered court documents showing that Steven Page sued former bandmate Robertson over the song, alleging that he was promised 20% of the proceeds, but that Robertson has kept that money entirely for himself.[32]\\r\\nFor the first three seasons, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco, the three main stars of the show, received at most $60,000 per episode. The salary for the three went up to $200,000 per episode for the fourth season. Their per-episode pay went up an additional $50,000 in each of the following three seasons, culminating in $350,000 per episode in the seventh season.[33][34] In September 2013, Bialik and Rauch renegotiated the contracts they held since they were introduced to the series in 2010. On their old contracts, each was making $20,000ÿ$30,000 per episode, while the new contracts doubled that, beginning at $60,000 per episode, increasing steadily to $100,000 per episode by the end of the contract, as well as adding another year for both.[35]\\r\\nBy season seven, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco were also receiving 0.25% of the series' back-end money. Before production began on the eighth season, the three plus Helberg and Nayyar, looked to renegotiate new contracts, with Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco seeking around $1 million per episode, as well as more back-end money.[36] Contracts were signed in the beginning of August 2014, giving the three principal actors an estimated $1 million per episode for three years, with the possibility to extend for a fourth year. The deals also include larger pieces of the show, signing bonuses, production deals, and advances towards the back-end.[37] Helberg and Nayyar were also able to renegotiate their contracts, giving them a per-episode pay in the \\"mid-six-figure range\\", up from around $100,000 per episode they each received in years prior. The duo, who were looking to have salary parity with Parsons, Galecki, and Cuoco, signed their contracts after the studio and producers threatened to write the characters out of the series if a deal could not be reached before the start of production on season eight.[38] By season 10, Helberg and Nayyar reached the $1 million per episode parity with Parsons, Galecki, and Cuoco, due to a clause in their deals signed in 2014.[39]\\r\\nIn March 2017, the main cast members (Galecki, Parsons, Cuoco, Helberg, and Nayyar) took a 10% pay cut to allow Bialik and Rauch an increase in their earnings.[40] This put Galecki, Parsons, Cuoco, Helberg and Nayyar at $900,000 per episode, with Parsons, Galecki, and Helberg also receiving overall deals with Warner Bros. Television.[24] By the end of April, Bialik and Rauch had signed deals to earn $500,000 per episode, each, with the deals also including a separate development component for both actors. The deal was an increase from the $175,000 - $200,000 the duo had been making per episode.[41]\\r\\nThese actors are credited in all episodes of the series:\\r\\nThese actors were first credited as guest stars and later promoted to main cast:\\r\\nAs the theme of the show revolves around science, many distinguished and high-profile scientists have appeared as guest stars on the show. Famous astrophysicist and Nobel laureate George Smoot had a cameo appearance in the second season.[56] Theoretical physicist Brian Greene also appeared on the show in the fourth season. Astrophysicist, science populizer, and physics outreach specialist Neil deGrasse Tyson also appeared in the fourth season.\\r\\nCosmologist Stephen Hawking made a short guest appearance in the fifth season episode;[57] in the eighth season, Hawking video conferences with Sheldon and Leonard, and makes another appearance in the 200th episode. In the fifth and sixth seasons, NASA astronaut Michael J. Massimino played himself multiple times in the role of Howard's fellow astronaut. Bill Nye appeared in the seventh season, and Elon Musk made an appearance in the ninth season.\\r\\nMuch of the series focuses on science, particularly physics. The four main male characters are employed at Caltech and have science-related occupations, as do Bernadette and Amy. The characters frequently banter about scientific theories or news (notably around the start of the show), and make science-related jokes.\\r\\nScience has also interfered with the characters' romantic lives. Leslie breaks up with Leonard when he sides with Sheldon in his support for string theory rather than loop quantum gravity.[70] When Leonard joins Sheldon, Raj, and Howard on a three-month Arctic research trip, it separates Leonard and Penny at a time their relationship is budding. When Bernadette takes an interest in Leonard's work, it makes both Penny and Howard envious and results in Howard confronting Leonard, and Penny asking Sheldon to teach her physics.[71] Sheldon and Amy also briefly end their relationship after an argument over which of their fields is superior.[72]\\r\\nDavid Saltzberg, who has a PhD in physics, has served as the science consultant for the show for six seasons and attends every taping.[73] While Saltzberg knows physics, he sometimes needs assistance from Mayim Bialik, who has a PhD in neuroscience.[74] Saltzberg sees early versions of scripts which need scientific information added to them, and he also points out where the writers, despite their knowledge of science, have made a mistake. He is usually not needed during a taping unless a lot of science, and especially the whiteboard, is involved.[74]\\r\\nThe four main male characters are all avid science fiction, fantasy, and comic book fans and memorabilia collectors.\\r\\nStar Trek in particular is frequently referenced and Sheldon identifies strongly with the character of Spock, so much so that when he is given a used napkin signed by Leonard Nimoy as a Christmas gift from Penny he is overwhelmed with excitement and gratitude (\\"I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!\\").[75] Star Trek: The Original Series cast member George Takei has made a cameo, and Leonard Nimoy made a cameo as the voice of Sheldon's vintage Mr. Spock action figure (both cameos were in dream sequences). Star Trek: The Next Generation cast members Brent Spiner and LeVar Burton have had cameos as themselves,[76][77] while Wil Wheaton has a recurring role as a fictionalized version of himself.\\r\\nThey are also fans of Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, and Doctor Who. In the episode \\"The Ornithophobia Diffusion\\", when there is a delay in watching Star Wars on Blu-ray, Howard complains, \\"If we don't start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again\\" (referring to Lucas' controversial alterations to the films) and in \\"The Hot Troll Deviation\\", Katee Sackhoff of Battlestar Galactica appeared as Howard's fantasy dream girl. The characters have different tastes in franchises with Sheldon praising Firefly but disapproving of Leonard's enjoyment of Babylon 5.[78][n 1] With regard to fantasy, the four make frequent references to The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter novels and movies. Additionally, Howard can speak Sindarin, one of the two Elvish languages from The Lord of the Rings.\\r\\nWednesday night is the group's designated \\"comic book night\\"[79] because that is the day of the week when new comic books are released. The comic book store is run by fellow geek and recurring character Stuart. On a number of occasions, the group members have dressed up as pop culture characters, including The Flash, Aquaman, Frodo Baggins, Superman, Batman, Spock, The Doctor, Green Lantern, and Thor.[80] As a consequence of losing a bet to Stuart and Wil Wheaton, the group members are forced to visit the comic book store dressed as Catwoman, Wonder Woman, Batgirl, and Supergirl.[81] DC Comics announced that, to promote its comics, the company will sponsor Sheldon wearing Green Lantern T-shirts.[82]\\r\\nVarious games have been featured, as well as referenced, on the series (e.g. World of Warcraft, Halo, Mario, etc.), including fictional games like Mystic Warlords of Ka'a (which became a reality in 2011)[83] and Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock.\\r\\nOne of the recurring plot lines is the relationship between Leonard and Penny. Leonard becomes attracted to Penny in the pilot episode and his need to do favors for her is a frequent point of humor in the first season. Their first long term relationship begins when Leonard returns from a three-month expedition to the North Pole in the season 3 premiere. However, when Leonard tells Penny that he loves her, she realizes she cannot say it back. Both Leonard and Penny go on to date other people; most notably with Leonard dating Raj's sister Priya for much of season 4. This relationship is jeopardized when Leonard comes to falsely believe that Raj has slept with Penny, and ultimately ends when Priya sleeps with a former boyfriend in \\"The Good Guy Fluctuation\\".\\r\\nPenny, who admits to missing Leonard in \\"The Roommate Transmogrification\\", accepts his request to renew their relationship in \\"The Beta Test Initiation\\". After Penny suggests having sex in \\"The Launch Acceleration\\", Leonard breaks the mood by proposing to her. Penny says \\"no\\" but does not break up with him. She stops a proposal a second time in \\"The Tangible Affection Proof\\". In the sixth-season episode, \\"The 43 Peculiarity\\", Penny finally tells Leonard that she loves him. Although they both feel jealousy when the other receives significant attention from the opposite sex, Penny is secure enough in their relationship to send him off on an exciting four-month expedition without worrying in \\"The Bon Voyage Reaction\\". After Leonard returns, their relationship blossoms over the seventh season. In the penultimate episode \\"The Gorilla Dissolution\\", Penny admits that they should marry and when Leonard realizes that she is serious, he proposes with a ring that he had been saving for years. Leonard and Penny decide to elope to Las Vegas in the season 8 finale, but beforehand, wanting no secrets, Leonard admits to kissing another woman, Mandy Chow (Melissa Tang) while on an expedition on the North Sea. Despite this, Leonard and Penny finally elope in the season 9 premiere.\\r\\nIn the third-season finale, Raj and Howard search for a woman compatible with Sheldon and discover neurobiologist Amy Farrah Fowler. Like him, she has a history of social ineptitude and participates in online dating only to fulfill an agreement with her mother. This spawns a storyline in which Sheldon and Amy communicate daily while insisting to Leonard and Penny that they are not romantically involved. In \\"The Agreement Dissection\\", Sheldon and Amy talk in her apartment after a night of dancing and she kisses him on the lips. Instead of getting annoyed, Sheldon says \\"fascinating\\" and later asks Amy to be his girlfriend in \\"The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition\\". The same night he draws up \\"The Relationship Agreement\\" to verify the ground rules of him as her boyfriend and vice versa (similar to his \\"Roommate Agreement\\" with Leonard). Amy agrees but later regrets not having had a lawyer read through it.\\r\\nIn the episode \\"The Launch Acceleration\\", Amy tries to use her \\"neurobiology bag of tricks\\" to increase the attraction between herself and Sheldon. In the final fifth-season episode \\"The Countdown Reflection\\", Sheldon takes Amy's hand as Howard is launched into space. In the sixth season first episode \\"The Date Night Variable\\", after a dinner in which Sheldon fails to live up to this expectation, Amy gives Sheldon an ultimatum that their relationship is over unless he tells her something from his heart. Amy accepts Sheldon's romantic speech even after learning that it is a line from the first Spider-Man movie. In \\"The Cooper/Kripke Inversion\\" Sheldon states that he has been working on his discomfort about physical contact and admits that \\"it's a possibility\\" that he could one day have sex with Amy. Amy is revealed to have similar feelings in \\"The Love Spell Potential\\". Sheldon explains that he never thought about intimacy with anyone before Amy.[84]\\r\\n\\"The Locomotive Manipulation\\" is the first episode in which Sheldon initiates a kiss with Amy. Although initially done in a fit of sarcasm, he discovers that he enjoys the feeling. Consequently, Sheldon slowly starts to open up over the rest of the season, and starts a more intimate relationship with Amy. However, in the season finale, Sheldon leaves temporarily to cope with several changes and Amy becomes distraught. However, in \\"The Prom Equivalency\\" he hides in his room to avoid going to a mock prom reenactment with her. In the resulting stand-off, Amy is about to confess that she loves Sheldon, but he surprises her by saying that he loves her too. This prompts Amy to have a panic attack.\\r\\nIn the season eight finale, Sheldon and Amy get into a fight about commitment on their 5-year anniversary. Amy tells Sheldon that she needs to think about the future of their relationship, unaware that Sheldon was about to propose to her. Season nine sees Sheldon harassing Amy about making up her mind until she breaks up with him. Both struggle with singlehood and trying to be friends for the next few weeks until they reunite in episode ten and have sex for the first time on Amy's birthday.\\r\\nIn scenes set at Howard's home, he interacts with his rarely-seen mother (voiced by Carol Ann Susi until her death) by shouting from room to room in the house. She similarly interacts with other characters in this manner.[85] She reflects the Jewish mother stereotype in some ways, such as being overly controlling of Howard's adult life and sometimes trying to make him feel guilty about causing her trouble. She is dependent on Howard, as she requires him to help her with her wig and makeup in the morning. Howard in turn is attached to his mother to the point where she still cuts his meat for him, takes him to the dentist, does his laundry and \\"grounds\\" him when he returns home after briefly moving out.[86] Until Howard's marriage to Bernadette in the fifth-season finale, Howard's former living situation led Leonard's psychiatrist mother to speculate that he may suffer from some type of pathology,[87] and Sheldon to refer to their relationship as Oedipal.[88] In season 8, Howard's mother dies in her sleep while in Florida, which devastates Howard and Stuart, who briefly lived with Mrs. Wolowitz.\\r\\nLike most shows created by Chuck Lorre, The Big Bang Theory ends by showing a vanity card written by Lorre after the credits, followed by the Warner Bros. Television closing logo. These cards are archived on Lorre's website.[89]\\r\\nThrough the use of his vanity cards at the end of episodes, Lorre alleged that the program had been plagiarized by a show produced and aired in Belarus. Officially titled ׿ѿҿ (The Theorists), the show features \\"clones\\" of the main characters, a similar opening sequence, and what appears to be a very close Russian translation of the scripts.[90] Lorre expressed annoyance and described his inquiry with the Warner Bros. legal department about options. The television production company and station's close relationship with the Belarus government was cited as the reason that any attempt to claim copyright infringement would be in vain because the company copying the episodes is operated by the government.[91]\\r\\nHowever, no legal action was required to end production of the other show: as soon as it became known that the show was unlicensed, the actors quit and the producers cancelled it.[92] Dmitriy Tankovich (who plays Leonard's counterpart, \\"Seva\\") said in an interview, \\"I'm upset. At first, the actors were told all legal issues were resolved. We didn't know it wasn't the case, so when the creators of The Big Bang Theory started talking about the show, I was embarrassed. I can't understand why our people first do, and then think. I consider this to be the rock bottom of my career. And I don't want to take part in a stolen show\\".[93]\\r\\nInitial reception for the series was mixed. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 55% approval rating for the first season based on reviews from 22 critics, with an average rating of 5.18/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Big Bang Theory brings a new class of character to mainstream television, but much of the comedy feels formulaic and stiff.\\"[94] On Metacritic, the season holds a score of 57 out of 100, based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".[95] Later seasons received more acclaim and in 2013, TV Guide ranked the series #52 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.[96]\\r\\nThe Big Bang Theory started off slowly in the ratings, failing to make the top 50 in its first season (ranking 68th), and ranking 40th in its second season. When the third season premiered on September 21, 2009, however, The Big Bang Theory ranked as CBS's highest-rated show of that evening in the adults 18ÿ49 demographic (4.6/10) along with a then-series-high 12.83?million viewers.[97] After the first three seasons aired at different times on Monday nights, CBS moved the show to Thursdays at 8:00 ET for the 2010ÿ2011 schedule, to be in direct competition with NBC's Comedy Block and Fox's American Idol (then the longest reigning leading primetime show on U.S. television from 2004 to 2011).[98] During its fourth season, it became television's highest rated comedy, just barely beating out eight-year champ Two and a Half Men. However, in the age 18ÿ49 demographic (the show's target age range), it was the second highest rated comedy, behind ABC's Modern Family. The fifth season opened with viewing figures of over 14 million.[99]\\r\\nThe sixth season boasts some of the highest-rated episodes for the show so far, with a then-new series high set with \\"The Bakersfield Expedition\\", with 20 million viewers,[100] a first for the series, which along with NCIS, made CBS the first network to have two scripted series reach that large an audience in the same week since 2007. In the sixth season, the show became the highest rated and viewed scripted show in the 18ÿ49 demographic, trailing only the live regular NBC Sunday Night Football coverage,[101][102] and was third in total viewers, trailing NCIS and Sunday Night Football.[103] Season seven of the series opened strong, continuing the success gained in season six, with the second episode of the premiere, \\"The Deception Verification\\", setting the new series high in viewers with 20.44 million.[104][105]\\r\\nShowrunner Steve Molaro, who took over from Bill Prady with the sixth season, credits some of the show's success to the sitcom's exposure in off-network syndication, particularly on TBS, while Michael Schneider of TV Guide attributes it to the timeslot move two seasons earlier. Chuck Lorre and CBS Entertainment president Nina Tassler also credit the success to the influence of Molaro, in particular the deepening exploration of the firmly established regular characters and their interpersonal relationships, such as the on-again, off-again relationship between Leonard and Penny.[106] Throughout much of the 2012ÿ13 season, The Big Bang Theory placed first in all of syndication ratings, receiving formidable competition from only Judge Judy and Wheel of Fortune (first-run syndication programs). By the end of the 2012ÿ13 television season, The Big Bang Theory had dethroned Judge Judy as the ratings leader in all of syndicated programming with 7.1, Judy descending to second place for that season with a 7.0.[107] The Big Bang Theory did not place first in syndication ratings for the 2013ÿ14 television season, beaten out by Judge Judy.[108]\\r\\nThe show made its United Kingdom debut on Channel 4 on February 14, 2008. The show was also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot E4 prior to the main channel's airing. While the show's ratings were not deemed strong enough for the main channel, they were considered the opposite for E4. For each following season, all episodes were shown first-run on E4, with episodes only aired on the main channel in a repeat capacity, usually on a weekend morning. From the third season, the show aired in two parts, being split so that it could air new episodes for longer throughout the year. This was due to rising ratings. The first part began airing on December 17, 2009 at 9:00?p.m. while the second part, containing the remaining eleven episodes, began airing in the same time period from May 6, 2010. The first half of the fourth season began airing on November 4, 2010, at 9:00?p.m., drawing 877,000 viewers, with a further 256,000 watching on the E4+1 hour service. This gave the show an overall total of 1.13 million viewers, making it E4's most watched programme for that week. The increased ratings continued over subsequent weeks.[138]\\r\\nThe fourth season's second half began on June 30, 2011. Season 5 began airing on November 3, 2011 at 8:00?p.m. as part of E4's Comedy Thursdays, acting as a lead-in to the channel's newest comedy, Perfect Couples. Episode 19, the highest-viewed episode of the season, attracted 1.4?million viewers.[139] Season 6 premiered on November 15, 2012, with 1.89 million viewers and a further 469,000 on the time shift channel, bringing the total to 2.31 million, E4's highest viewing ratings of 2012, and the highest the channel had received since June 2011. The sixth season returned in mid 2013 to finish airing the remaining episodes.[140] Season 7 premiered on E4 on October 31, 2013 at 8:30pm and hit multiple ratings records this season. The second half of season seven aired in mid 2014.[141] The eighth season premiered on E4 on October 23, 2014 at 8:30?p.m.[142] During its eighth season, The Big Bang Theory shared its 8:30?p.m. time period with fellow CBS comedy, 2 Broke Girls. Following the airing of the first eight episodes of that show's fourth season, The Big Bang Theory returned to finish airing its eighth season on March 19, 2015.[143]\\r\\nNetflix UK & Ireland announced on February 13, 2016 that seasons 1ÿ8 would be available to stream from February 15, 2016.[144]\\r\\nThe Big Bang Theory started off quietly in Canada, but managed to garner major success in later seasons. The Big Bang Theory is telecast throughout Canada via the CTV Television Network in simultaneous substitution with cross-border CBS affiliates. Now immensely popular in Canada, The Big Bang Theory is also rerun daily on the Canadian cable channel The Comedy Network.\\r\\nThe season 4 premiere garnered an estimated 3.1 million viewers across Canada. This is the largest audience for a sitcom since the series finale of Friends (12.4 million viewers). The Big Bang Theory has pulled ahead and has now become the most-watched entertainment television show in Canada.[145]\\r\\nThe Big Bang Theory premiered in the United States on September 24, 2007 on CBS. The series debuted in Canada on CTV in September 2007.[146] On February 14, 2008, the series debuted in the United Kingdom on channels E4 and Channel 4.[147] In Australia the first seven seasons of the series began airing on the Seven Network and 7mate from October 2015 and also gained the rights to season 8 in 2016, though the Nine Network has rights to air seasons nine & ten.[148][149]\\r\\nIn May 2010, it was reported that the show had been picked up for syndication, mainly among Fox's owned and operated stations and other local stations, with Warner Bros. Television's sister cable network TBS holding the show's cable syndication rights. Broadcast of old shows began airing in September 2011. TBS now airs the series in primetime on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, with evening broadcasts on Saturdays (TBS's local sister station in Atlanta also holds local weeknight rights to the series).[150] Although details of the syndication deal have not been revealed, it was reported the deal \\"set a record price for a cable off-network sitcom purchase\\".[151] CTV holds national broadcast syndication rights in Canada, while sister cable network The Comedy Network holds cable rights.\\r\\nWarner Bros. Television controls the online rights for the show.[152][153] Full episodes are available at tv.com, while short clips and recently aired full episodes are available on cbs.com.[154] In Canada, recent episode(s) and pictures are available on CTV.ca.[155] After the show has aired in New Zealand the shows are available in full online at TVNZ's on demand web service.\\r\\nThe first and second seasons were only available on DVD upon their time of release in 2008[183] and 2009.[184] Starting with the release of the third season in 2010[185] and continuing every year with every new season, a Blu-ray disc set has also been released in conjunction with the DVD. In 2012, Warner Bros. released the first two seasons on Blu-ray,[186] marking the first time that all episodes were available on the Blu-ray disc format.\\r\\nIn August 2009, the sitcom won the best comedy series TCA award and Jim Parsons (Sheldon) won the award for individual achievement in comedy.[187] In 2010, the show won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedy, while Parsons won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.[188] On January 16, 2011, Parsons was awarded a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series?ÿ Comedy or Musical, an award that was presented by co-star Kaley Cuoco. On September 18, 2011, Parsons was again awarded an Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy Series. On January 9, 2013, the show won People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedy for a second time. August 25, 2014, Jim Parsons was awarded an Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy Series.[189] The Big Bang Theory also won the 2016 People's Choice Awards for under Favorite TV Show and Favorite Network TV Comedy with Jim Parsons winning Favorite Comedic TV Actor.[190] On January 20, 2016, The Big Bang Theory also won the International category at the UK's National Television Awards.[191]\\r\\nOn March 16, 2014, a Lego Ideas project[192] portraying the living room scene in Lego style with the main cast as minifigures reached 10,000 supporters on the platform, which qualified it to be considered as an official set by the Lego Ideas review board. On November 7, 2014, Lego Ideas approved the design and began refining it. The set was released in August 2015, with an exclusive pre-sale taking place at the San Diego Comic-Con International.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn November 2016, it was reported that CBS was in negotiations to create a spin-off of The Big Bang Theory centered on Sheldon as a young boy. The prequel series, described as \\"a Malcolm in the Middle-esque single-camera family comedy\\" would be executive produced by Lorre and Molaro, with Prady expected to be involved in some capacity, and intended to air in the 2017ÿ18 season alongside The Big Bang Theory.[193][194] The initial idea for the series came from Parsons, who passed it along to The Big Bang Theory producers.[195] In early March 2017, Iain Armitage was cast as the younger Sheldon, as well as Zoe Perry as his mother, Mary Cooper. Perry is the real-life daughter of Laurie Metcalf, who portrays Mary Cooper on The Big Bang Theory.[195]\\r\\nOn March 13, 2017, CBS ordered the spin-off Young Sheldon series. Jon Favreau will direct and executive produce the pilot. Created by Lorre and Molaro, the series follows 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper as he attends high school in East Texas. Alongside Armitage as 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper and Perry as Mary Cooper, Lance Barber stars as George Cooper, Sheldon's father; Raegan Revord stars as Missy Cooper, Sheldon's twin sister; and Montana Jordan as George Cooper, Sheldon's older brother. Jim Parsons reprises his role as adult Sheldon Cooper, as narrator for the series. Parsons, Lorre, Molaro and Todd Spiewak will also serve as executive producers on the series, for Chuck Lorre Productions, Inc. in association with Warner Bros. Television.[196] It is scheduled to begin airing on November 2, 2017, after The Big Bang Theory. It will have a special preview on September 25, 2017.[197]","input":"What is the current big bang theory season?"},{"output":"the 2030s","context":"A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction, aerospace engineering, and scientific proposals since the 19th century.

The list of manned Mars mission plans in the 20th century shows the various mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space agencies in this field of space exploration.\\r\\nIn the 2010s, numerous Chinese, European and American agencies were developing proposals for human missions to Mars. They are now developing and testing the technologies.\\r\\nMars in fiction is a frequent target of exploration and settlement in books, graphic novels, and films.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe energy needed for transfer between planetary orbits, or \\"?V\\", is lowest at intervals fixed by the synodic period. For Earth / Mars trips, this is every 26 months (2 years and 2 months),[1] so missions are typically planned to coincide with one of these launch windows. The energy needed in the low-energy windows varies on roughly a 15-year cycle[1] with the easiest windows needing only half the energy of the peaks.[2] In the 20th century, there was a minimum in the 1969 and 1971 launch windows and another low in 1986 and 1988, then the cycle repeated.[1]\\r\\nSeveral types of mission plans have been proposed, such as the opposition class and conjunction class,[2] or the Crocco flyby.[3] The lowest energy transfer to Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit; a mission to Mars using Hohmann transfer involves an approximately 9 month travel time from Earth to Mars, about five hundred days at Mars to wait for the transfer window to Earth, and a Hohmann transfer of about 9 months to return to Earth.\\r\\nShorter Mars mission plans have round-trip flight times of 400 to 450 days,[4] but requiring a higher energy. A fast Mars mission of 245 days round trip could be possible with on-orbit staging.[5] In 2014 ballistic capture was proposed, which may reduce fuel cost and provide more flexible launch windows compared to the Hohmann.[6]\\r\\nIn the Crocco grand tour, a crewed spacecraft would get a flyby of Mars and Venus for under a year in space.[7] Some flyby mission architectures can also be extended to include a style of Mars landing with a flyby excursion lander spacecraft.[8] Proposed by R. Titus in 1966, it involved extending a flyby mission with a short stay lander.[8] Basically, a short stay lander-ascent vehicle would separate from a \\"parent\\" Earth-Mars transfer prior to its flyby of Mars.[8] The Ascent-Descent lander would arrive sooner and either go into orbit around Mars or land, and depending on the design offer perhaps 10ÿ30 days before it needed to launch itself back to the main transfer vehicle.[8] (see also Mars flyby).\\r\\nThe estimated cost of sending humans to Mars is roughly 500 billion U.S. dollars, though the actual costs are likely to be more.[9] The largest limiting factor for sending humans to Mars is funding. In the late 1950s, rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States stimulated a national priority to send humans to the Moon. Under the current global geopolitical climate, however, government funding of these programs has decreased. Recent participation of private companies in space travel and participation by new nations such as India[10] may present new opportunities.\\r\\nCritics argue the immediate benefits of establishing a human presence on Mars are more esoteric than practical. Yet proponents of human space exploration contend that while the short term benefits will be academic, the symbolism of establishing a presence in space may garner public interest to join the cause and spark global cooperation. Furthermore, experts maintain that a long-term investment will be necessary for humanitys survival.[9]\\r\\nThere are several key physical challenges for human missions to Mars:[14]\\r\\nSome of these issues were estimated statistically in the HUMEX study.[23] Ehlmann and others have reviewed political and economic concerns, as well as technological and biological feasibility aspects.[24] While fuel for roundtrip travel could be a challenge, methane and oxygen can be produced using Martian H2O (preferably as water ice instead of liquid water) and atmospheric CO2 with mature technology.[25]\\r\\nRobotic spacecraft to Mars are required to be sterilized, to have at most 300,000 spores on the exterior of the craftand more thoroughly sterilized if they contact \\"special regions\\" containing water,[26][27] as otherwise there is a risk of contaminating not only the life-detection experiments but possibly the planet itself.[28]\\r\\nIt is impossible to sterilize human missions to this level, as humans are host to typically a hundred trillion microorganisms of thousands of species of the human microbiota, and these cannot be removed while preserving the life of the human. Containment seems the only option, but it is a major challenge in the event of a hard landing (i.e. crash).[29] There have been several planetary workshops on this issue, but with no final guidelines for a way forward yet.[30] Human explorers would also be vulnerable to back contamination to Earth if they become carriers of microorganisms.[31]\\r\\nOver the last century, a number of mission concepts for such an expedition have been proposed. David Portree's history volume Humans to Mars: Fifty Years of Mission Planning, 1950ÿ2000 discusses many of these.[1]\\r\\nWernher von Braun was the first person to make a detailed technical study of a Mars mission.[1][33] Details were published in his book Das Marsprojekt (1952, published in English as The Mars Project in 1962[34]) and several subsequent works.[35] Willy Ley popularized a similar mission in English in the book The Conquest of Space (1949), featuring illustrations by Chesley Bonestell. Von Braun's Mars project envisioned nearly a thousand three-stage vehicles launching from Earth to ferry parts for the Mars mission to be constructed at a space station in Earth orbit.[33][36] The mission itself featured a fleet of ten spacecraft with a combined crew of 70 heading to Mars, bringing three winged surface excursion ships that would land horizontally on the surface of Mars. (Winged landing was considered possible because at the time of his proposal, the Martian atmosphere was believed to be much denser than was later found to be the case.)\\r\\nIn the 1956 revised vision of the Mars Project plan, published in the book The Exploration of Mars by Wernher Von Braun and Willy Ley, the size of the mission was trimmed, requiring only 400 launches to put together two ships, still carrying a winged landing vehicle.[37] Later versions of the mission proposal, featured in the Disney \\"Man In Space\\" film series,[38] showed nuclear-powered ion-propulsion vehicles for the interplanetary cruise.\\r\\nIn 1962, Aeronutronic Ford,[39] General Dynamics and the Lockheed Missiles and Space Company made studies of Mars mission designs as part of NASA Marshall Spaceflight Center \\"Project EMPIRE\\".[33] These studies indicated that a Mars mission (possibly including a Venus fly-by) could be done with a launch of eight Saturn V boosters and assembly in low Earth orbit, or possibly with a single launch of a hypothetical \\"post Saturn\\" heavy-lift vehicle. Although the EMPIRE missions were only studies, and never proposed as funded projects, these were the first detailed analyses of what it would take to accomplish a human voyage to Mars using data from actual NASA spaceflight, and laid much of the basis for future studies, including significant mission studies by TRW, North American, Philco, Lockheed, Douglas, and General Dynamics, along with several in-house NASA studies.[33]\\r\\nFollowing the success of the Apollo Program, von Braun advocated a manned mission to Mars as a focus for NASA's manned space program.[40] Von Braun's proposal used Saturn V boosters to launch nuclear-powered (NERVA) upper stages that would power two six-crew spacecraft on a dual mission in the early 1980s. The proposal was considered by (then president) Richard Nixon but passed over in favor of the Space Shuttle.\\r\\nIn 1975, von Braun discussed the mission architecture that emerged from these Apollo-era studies in a recorded lecture and while doing so suggested that multiple Shuttle launches could instead be configured to lift the two Nuclear Thermal Rocket engine equipped spacecrafts in smaller parts, for assembly in-orbit.[41]\\r\\nThe Martian Piloted Complex or \\"'MPK'\\" was a proposal by Mikhail Tikhonravov of the Soviet Union for a manned Mars expedition, using the (then proposed) N-1 rocket, in studies from 1956 to 1962. The Soviets sent many probes to Mars with some noted success stories including Mars atmospheric entry, but the ratio was low and their space program struggled through disasters like the lost Salyut 1 crew and explosions of their N-1 rocket (see Mars 3)\\r\\nHeavy Interplanetary Spacecraft (known by the Russian acronym TMK) was the designation of a Soviet Union space exploration proposal in the 1960s to send a manned flight to Mars and Venus (TMK-MAVR design) without landing. The TMK spacecraft was due to launch in 1971 and make a three-year-long flight including a Mars fly-by at which time probes would have been dropped. The project was never completed because the required N1 rocket never flew successfully. The Mars Expeditionary Complex, or \\"'MEK\\"' (1969) was another Soviet proposal for a Mars expedition that would take a crew from three to six to Mars and back with a total mission duration of 630 days.\\r\\nFollowing the Viking missions to Mars, between 1981 and 1996 a series of conferences named The Case for Mars were held at the University of Colorado at Boulder. These conferences advocated human exploration of Mars, presented concepts and technologies, and held a series of workshops to develop a baseline concept for the mission. The baseline concept was notable in that it proposed use of in-situ resource utilization to manufacture rocket propellant for the return trip using the resources of Mars. The mission study was published in a series of proceedings volumes[42][43] published by the American Astronautical Society. Later conferences in the series presented a number of alternative concepts, including the \\"Mars Direct\\" concept of Robert Zubrin and David Baker; the \\"Footsteps to Mars\\" proposal of Geoffrey A. Landis,[44] which proposed intermediate steps before the landing on Mars, including human missions to Phobos; and the \\"Great Exploration\\" proposal from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, among others.\\r\\nIn response to a presidential initiative, NASA made a study of a project for human lunar- and Mars exploration as a proposed follow-on to the International Space Station project. This resulted in a report, called the 90-day study,[45] in which the agency proposed a long-term plan consisting of completing the Space Station as \\"a critical next step in all our space endeavors,\\" returning to the moon and establishing a permanent base, and then sending astronauts to Mars. This report was widely criticized as too elaborate and expensive, and all funding for human exploration beyond Earth orbit was canceled by Congress.[46]\\r\\nBecause of the greater distance, the Mars mission would be much more risky and expensive than past Moon flights. Supplies and fuel would have to be prepared for a 2-3 year round trip and the spacecraft would need at least partial shielding from ionizing radiation. A 1990 paper by Robert Zubrin and David A. Baker, then of Martin Marietta, proposed reducing the mission mass (and hence the cost) by using in situ resource utilization to manufacture propellant from the Martian Atmosphere.[47][48] This proposal drew on concepts developed by the former \\"Case for Mars\\" conference series. Over the next decade, Zubrin developed it into a mission concept, Mars Direct, which he presented in a book, The Case for Mars (1996). The mission is advocated by the Mars Society, which Zubrin founded in 1998, as practical and affordable.\\r\\nIn 1991 in Toulouse, France, the International Space University studied an international human Mars mission.[49] They proposed a crew of 8 traveling to Mars in a nuclear-powered vessel with artificial gravity provided by rotation.[49] On the surface, 40 tonne habitats pressurized to 10?psi (69?kPa) were powered by a 40?kW photovoltaic array.[49]\\r\\nIn the 1990s NASA developed several conceptual level human Mars exploration architectures. One of these was NASA Design reference mission 3.0 (DRM 3.0) to stimulate further thought and concept development.\\r\\nSelected other US/NASA studies (1988ÿ2009):[50]\\r\\nThe NASA Mars Design Reference Missions consisted of a series of conceptual design studies for human Mars missions, continued in the 21st century Selected other US/NASA plans (1988ÿ2009):[50]\\r\\nThe Mars Piloted Orbital Station (or MARPOST) is a Russian proposed manned orbital mission to Mars, using a nuclear reactor to run an electric rocket engine. Proposed in October 2000 by Yuri Karash from the Russian Academy of Cosmonautics as the next step for Russia in space along with the Russian participation in the International Space Station, a 30-volume draft project for MARPOST was confirmed as of 2005.[53] Design for the ship was proposed to be ready in 2012, and the ship itself in 2021.[54]\\r\\nThe European Space Agency had a long-term vision of sending a human mission to Mars in 2033.[55] Laid out in 2001, the project's proposed timeline would begin with robotic exploration, a proof of concept simulation of sustaining humans on Mars, and eventually a manned mission; however, objections from the participating nations of ESA and other delays have put the timeline into question. Nevertheless, a spawn of this programme, ExoMars, delivered an orbiter to Mars in 2016\\r\\nAnother proposal for a joint ESA mission with Russia is based on two spacecraft being sent to Mars, one carrying a six-person crew and the other the expedition's supplies. The mission would take about 440 days to complete with three astronauts visiting the surface of the planet for a period of two months. The entire project would cost $20 billion and Russia would contribute 30% of these funds.[56]\\r\\nProject Constellation included an Orion Mars Mission. (Then United States President) George W. Bush announced an initiative of manned space exploration on January 14, 2004, known as the Vision for Space Exploration. It included developing preliminary plans for a lunar outpost by 2012[57] and establishing an outpost by 2020. Precursor missions that would help develop the needed technology during the 2010ÿ2020 decade were tentatively outlined by Adringa and others.[58] On September 24, 2007, Michael Griffin, then NASA Administrator, hinted that NASA may be able to launch a human mission to Mars by 2037.[59] The needed funds were to be generated by diverting $11 billion[60] from space science missions to the vision for human exploration.\\r\\nNASA has also discussed plans to launch Mars missions from the Moon to reduce traveling costs.[61]\\r\\nThe Mars Society Germany proposed a manned Mars mission using several launches of an improved heavy-lift version of the Ariane 5. Roughly 5 launches would be required to send a crew of 5 on a 1200 days mission, with a payload of 120,000?kg (260,000?lb). Total project was estimated to cost 10 to 15 billion Euros.[62]\\r\\nSun Laiyan, administrator of the China National Space Administration, said on July 20, 2006 that China would start deep space exploration focusing on Mars over the next five years, during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006ÿ2010) Program period.[63] The first uncrewed Mars exploration program could take place between 2014ÿ2033, followed by a crewed phase in 2040ÿ2060 in which crew members would land on Mars and return home.[64] The Mars 500 study of 2011 prepared for this manned mission.\\r\\nThe idea of a one-way trip to Mars has been proposed several times. Space activist Bruce Mackenzie, for example, proposed a one-way trip to Mars in a presentation \\"One Way to Mars ÿ a Permanent Settlement on the First Mission\\" at the 1998 International Space Development Conference,[65] arguing that since the mission could be done with less difficulty and expense without a return to Earth, the first mission to Mars should be a settlement, not a visit. In 2006, former NASA engineer James C. McLane III proposed a scheme to initially colonize Mars via a one-way trip by only one human. Papers discussing this concept appeared in The Space Review,[66] Harper's Magazine,[67] SEARCH Magazine[68] and The New York Times.[69]\\r\\nFormer Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin is a particularly outspoken promoter who has suggested in numerous forums \\"Forget the Moon, Let's Head to Mars!\\"[70] In June 2013, Aldrin wrote an opinion, published in The New York Times, supporting a manned mission to Mars and which viewed the moon \\"not as a destination but more a point of departure . . . \\"[71] In August 2015, Aldrin, in association with the Florida Institute of Technology, presented a \\"master plan\\" for NASA consideration proposing astronauts with a \\"tour of duty of ten years\\" colonize Mars before the year 2040.[72]\\r\\nNASA released initial details of the latest version conceptual level human Mars exploration architecture in this presentation. The study further developed concepts developed in previous NASA DRM and updated it to more current launchers and technology.\\r\\nNASA released an updated version of NASA DRM 5.0 in early 2009, featuring use of the Ares V launcher, Orion CEV, and updated mission planning. In this document.[73]\\r\\nExtrapolated from the DRMA 5.0, plans for a manned Mars expedition with chemical propulsion. Austere Human Missions to Mars\\r\\nIn a major space policy speech at Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010, former U.S. President Barack Obama predicted a manned Mars mission to orbit the planet by the mid-2030s, followed by a landing:\\r\\nBy the mid-2030s, I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth. And a landing on Mars will follow. And I expect to be around to see it.\\r\\nThe United States Congress has mostly approved a new direction for NASA that includes canceling Bush's planned return to the Moon by 2020 and instead proposes asteroid exploration in 2025 (Asteroid Redirect Mission) and orbiting Mars in the 2030s.[74] The Asteroid Redirect Mission was cancelled in June 2017 and \\"closed out\\" in September of the same year.\\r\\nMars 500, the longest high fidelity spaceflight simulation, ran from 2007 to 2011 in Russia and was an experiment to assess the feasibility of manned missions to mars.[75]\\r\\nA number of Mars mission concepts and proposals have been put forth by Russian scientists. Stated dates were for a launch sometime between 2016 and 2020. The Mars probe would carry a crew of four to five cosmonauts, who would spend close to two years in space.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn late 2011, Russian and European space agencies successfully completed the ground-based MARS-500.[76] The biomedical experiment simulating manned flight to Mars was completed in Russia in July 2000.[77]\\r\\nIn 2011, Jean-Marc Salotti published a new proposal for a manned Mars mission, with a release in 2012.[78][79] The 2-4-2 concept is based on a reduction of the crew size to only 2 astronauts and the duplication of the entire mission. There are 2 astronauts in each space vehicle, there are 4 on the surface of Mars and there are 2 once again in each return vehicle. In addition, at every step of the mission, there are 2 astronauts ready to help the 2 others (2 for 2). This architecture simplifies the entry, descent and landing procedures, which are known to be very risky, thanks to a significant reduction of the size of the landing vehicles. It also avoids the assembly of huge vehicles in LEO. The author claims that his proposal is much cheaper than the NASA reference mission without compromising the risks and can be undertaken before 2030.\\r\\nIn 2012, Conceptual Space Vehicle Architecture for Human Exploration of Mars, with Artificial Gravity and Mini-Magnetosphere Crew Radiation Shield was released, laying out a possible design for a human Mars mission.[80] Components of the architecture include various spacecraft for the Earth-to-Mars journey, landing, and surface stay as well as return.[80] Some features include a several unmanned cargo landers assembled into a base on the surface of Mars.[80] The crew would land at this base in the \\"Mars Personnel Lander\\", which could also take them back into Mars orbit.[80] The design for the manned interplanetary spacecraft included artificial-gravity and an artificial magnetic field.[80] Overall, the architecture was modular and to allow for incremental R&D.[80]\\r\\nIn 2012, a Dutch entrepreneur group began raising funds for a human Mars base to be established in 2023.[81] The mission is intended to be primarily a settlement mission with no return trip to Earth planned. Astronaut applications were invited from the public all over the world.\\r\\nThe initial plan included an orbiter and demonstration lander in 2018, followed by a rover in 2020, and the base components in 2024.[81] Mars One suggested it could use a SpaceX Heavy rocket to launch flight hardware.[81] The first crew of four astronauts were to land on Mars in 2025. Then, every two years, a new crew of four would arrive. The entire mission is to be filmed and broadcast as a media event. Revenues from broadcasting would help fund the program. In April 2015, Mars Ones CEO Bas Lansdorp admitted that their 12-year plan for landing humans on Mars by 2027 is mostly fiction.[82]\\r\\nIn 2013, the Inspiration Mars Foundation founded by Dennis Tito revealed plans of a manned mission to fly by Mars in 2018 with support from NASA.[83][84] NASA refused to fund the mission.\\r\\nOn December 2, 2014, NASA's Advanced Human Exploration Systems and Operations Mission Director Jason Crusan and Deputy Associate Administrator for Programs James Reuthner announced tentative support for the Boeing \\"Affordable Mars Mission Design\\"[clarification needed] including radiation shielding, centrifugal artificial gravity, in-transit consumable resupply, and a lander which can return.[85][86] Reuthner suggested that if adequate funding was forthcoming, the proposed mission would be expected in the early 2030s.[87]\\r\\nOn October 8, 2015, NASA published its official plan for human exploration and colonization of Mars. The plan operates through three distinct phases leading up to fully sustained colonization.[88]\\r\\nThe first stage, already underway, is the \\"Earth Reliant\\" phase. This phase continues using the International Space Station until 2024; validating deep space technologies and studying the effects of long duration space missions on the human body.\\r\\nThe second stage, \\"Proving Ground,\\" moves away from Earth reliance and ventures into cislunar space for most of its tasks. This is when NASA planned the now cancelled Asteroid Redirect Mission (for 2020), test deep space habitation facilities, and validate capabilities required for human exploration of Mars.\\r\\nFinally, phase three is the transition to independence from Earth resources. The \\"Earth Independent\\" phase includes long term missions on the lunar surface with surface habitats that only require routine maintenance, and the harvesting of Martian resources for fuel, water, and building materials. NASA is still aiming for human missions to Mars in the 2030s, though Earth independence could take decades longer.[89]\\r\\nIn November 2015, Administrator Bolden of NASA reaffirmed the goal of sending humans to Mars.[90] He laid out 2030 as the date of a manned surface landing, and noted that planned 2020 Mars rover would support the human mission.[90] Also discussed was the use of robotics to prepare an underground habitat for the arriving people.[90] He noted the advantages of living underground on Mars, especially that it eliminates the need to construct above ground shielding.[90] The underground base would be prepared in advance by an armada of robots.[90] Top surface activity was not excluded however, just that the crew would \\"probably live underground for the most part\\".[90]\\r\\nSince 2016, SpaceX publicly announced a comprehensive vision to begin the colonization of Mars, by proposing to develop a high-capacity transportation infrastructure.\\r\\nIn September 2016 at the International Astronautical Congress, Elon Musk announced the ITS launch vehicle design (informally discussed earlier as the Mars Colonial Transporter), that comprised a large reusable booster topped by a spaceship or a tanker for in-orbit refueling, as well as a propellant plant to be built on Mars, at a base referred to as Mars Base Alpha.[91] The aspirational objective is to advance the technology and infrastructure such that the first humans to Mars could potentially depart as early as 2024.[92][93][94][95][96][97]\\r\\nOn 29th September 2017, Elon Musk announced an updated vehicle design for the mars mission at the International Astronautical Congress. The replacement vehicle for this mission is called BFR (Big Falcon Rocket). BFR will provide the on-orbit activity like satellite delivery, servicing the International Space Station, Moon mission, as well as Mars mission. There are two phases for the human mission to Mars via BFR:\\r\\nMars Base Camp (MBC), an American spacecraft concept that proposes to send astronauts to Mars as early as 2028. The vehicle design, developed by Lockheed Martin,[98] would utilize both future and heritage concepts as well as the Orion MPCV built by NASA.\\r\\nThe Deep Space Transport (DST) is a spacecraft meant to be launched on top of NASA's SLS launch vehicle in 2027. It was announced by NASA in March 2017.[99] Plans at present predict it to dock with the Deep Space Gateway (DSG) station, which would be in cis-lunar space after its construction from 2021 to 2026 as a manned lunar space station, the first of its kind, in 2027. Current plans show it to be sent with a crew of 4 to Mars in 2033. It would not, however, land, but merely remain in Martian orbit until there is a launch window for a return. The mission is expected to take about 2 years if all missions in the DSG and DST from 2021ÿ2030 are successful. This mission would use only the SLS rocket for launches, with the Orion MPCV to be used as a spacecraft to transport the crew to and from the Earth and the DSG and DST.[100][101]\\r\\nA number of nations and organizations have long-term intentions to send humans to Mars.\\r\\nSignificant technological hurdles need to be overcome for human spaceflight to Mars.\\r\\nEntry into the thin and shallow Martian atmosphere will pose significant difficulties with re-entry and for a spacecraft of the weight needed to carry humans, along with life support, supplies and other equipment. Should a heat shield be used, it would need to be very large. Retro rockets could be used, but would add significant further weight.\\r\\nA return mission to Mars will need to land a rocket to carry crew off the surface. Launch requirements mean that this rocket would be significantly smaller than an Earth-to-orbit rocket. Mars-to-orbit launch can also be achieved in single stage. Despite this, landing an ascent rocket on Mars will be difficult. Reentry for a large rocket will be difficult.\\r\\nOne of the medical supplies that may be needed is intravenous fluid, which is mostly water but contains other things so it can be added directly to the human blood stream. If it can be created on the spot from existing water then it could spare the weight of hauling earth-produced units, whose weight is mostly water.[120] A prototype for this capability was tested on the International Space Station in 2010.[120]\\r\\nWhile it is possible for humans to breathe pure oxygen, a pure oxygen atmosphere was implicated in the Apollo 1 fire. As such, Mars habitats may have a need for additional gases. One possibility is to take nitrogen and argon from the atmosphere of Mars; however, they are hard to separate from each other.[121] As a result, a Mars habitat may use 40% argon, 40% nitrogen, and 20% oxygen.[121]\\r\\nAnother concept for breathing air is to use re-usable amine bead carbon dioxide scrubbers.[122] While one carbon dioxide scrubber filters the astronaut's air, the other is vented to the Mars atmosphere.[122]\\r\\nSome missions may be considered a \\"Mission to Mars\\" in their own right, or they may only be one step in a more in-depth program. An example of this is missions to Mars' moons, or flyby missions.\\r\\nAn example of this is Inspiration Mars, which could be compared to the Manned Venus Flyby (NASA) mission proposal of the 1970s, but for Mars.\\r\\nMany Mars mission concepts propose precursor missions to the moons of Mars, for example, a sample return mission to the Mars moon Phobos[123] ÿ not quite Mars, but perhaps a convenient stepping stone to an eventual Martian surface mission. Lockheed Martin, as part of their \\"Stepping stones to Mars\\" project, called the \\"Red Rocks Project\\", proposed to explore Mars robotically from Deimos.[44][124][125]\\r\\nUse of fuel produced from water resources on Phobos or Deimos has also been proposed.\\r\\nAn unmanned Mars sample return mission (MSR) has sometimes been considered to be an essential precursor to crewed missions to Mars' surface by the 21st century.[126] The ESA noted that a sample return as being essential and could bridge the gap between robotic and human missions to Mars.[126] An example of a Mars sample return mission is Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars.[127] Mars sample return was the highest priority Flagship Mission proposed for NASA by the Planetary Decadal Survey 2013ÿ2022: The Future of Planetary Science.[128] However, such missions have been hampered by complexity and expense, with one ESA proposal involving no less than five different unmanned spacecraft.[129]\\r\\nA difficulty in sample return plans is the concern that, however remote, something could be brought back that could infect life on the Earth.[129] Regardless, a basic set of guidelines for extraterrestrial sample return have been laid out depending on the source of sample (e.g. asteroid, Moon, Mars surface, etc.)[130] Hardware and mission parameters are designed following planetary protection protocols so mission concepts can proceed forward in an orderly way without causing undue concern over remote chances.[130] The issue of sample protection is another factor that increases the difficulty of sample return, both to keep the sample from getting contaminated with Earth material or life, and achieving a rational approach to keeping the Mars sample from \\"contaminating\\" Earth.[129]\\r\\nAt the dawn of the 21st century, NASA crafted four potential pathways to Mars human missions.[131] Of those four, three included a Mars sample return as a prerequisite to human landing, however one did not.[131]\\r\\nLandis[132] and Lupisella proposed to explore Mars via telepresence from human astronauts in orbit.[133]\\r\\nA similar idea, was the proposed \\"Human Exploration using Real-time Robotic Operations\\" (HERRO) mission.[134][135]\\r\\nAnother proposed mission was the Russian Mars Piloted Orbital Station.","input":"When is the first mission to mars planned?"},{"output":"architect","context":"Building design refers to the broadly based architectural, engineering and technical applications to the design of buildings. All building projects require the services of a building designer, typically a licensed architect or structural engineer. Smaller, less complicated projects often do not require a licensed professional, and the design of such projects is often undertaken by building designers, draftspersons, interior designers (for interior fit-outs or renovations), or contractors. Larger, more complex building projects require the services of many professionals trained in specialist disciplines, usually coordinated by an architect.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn architect is a person trained in the planning, design and supervision of the construction of buildings. Professionally, an architect's decisions affect public safety, and thus an architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a practicum (or internship) for practical experience to earn a license to practice architecture. In most of the world's jurisdictions, the professional and commercial use of the term \\"architect\\" is legally protected.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilding engineering typically includes the services of electrical, mechanical and Structural engineers.\\r\\n\\r\\nA draftsperson or documenter is someone who has attained a certificate or diploma in architectural drafting (or equivalent training), and provides services relating to the preparation of construction documents rather than building design. Some draftspersons are employed by architectural design firms and building contractors, while others are self-employed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many places, building codes and legislation of professions allow persons to design single family residential buildings and in some cases light commercial buildings without an architectural license. As such, \\"Building designer\\" is a common designation in the United States, Canada and elsewhere for someone who offers building design services but is not a licensed architect or engineer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyone may use the title of \\"building designer\\" in the broadest sense. In many places, a building designer may achieve certification demonstrating a higher level of training. In the U.S., the National Council of Building Designer Certification (NCBDC),[1] an offshoot of the American Institute of Building Design,[2] administers a program leading to the title of Certified Professional Building Designer (CPBD). In most cases, building designers are trained as architectural technologists or draftspersons; they may also be architecture school graduates that have not completed licensing requirements.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany building designers are known as \\"residential\\" or \\"home designers\\", since they focus mainly on residential design and remodeling. In the U.S. state of Nevada, \\"Residential Designer\\" is a regulated term for those who are registered as such under Nevada State Board of Architecture, Interior Design and Residential Design, and one may not legally represent oneself in a professional capacity without being currently registered.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia where use of the term architect and some derivatives is highly restricted but the architectural design of buildings has very few restrictions in place, the term building designer is used extensively by people or design practices who are not registered by the relevant State Board of Architects. In Queensland the term building design is used in legislation which licences practitioners as part of a broader building industry licensing system. In Victoria there is a registration process for building designers and in other States there is currently no regulation of the profession. A Building Designers Association operates in each state to represent the interests of building designers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilding surveyors are technically minded general practitioners in the United Kingdom, Australia and elsewhere,[3] trained much like architectural technologists. In the UK, the knowledge and expertise of the building surveyor is applied to various tasks in the property and construction markets, including building design for smaller residential and light commercial projects. This aspect of the practice is similar to other European occupations, most notably the geometra in Italy, but also the gomtre in France, Belgium and Switzerland.\\r\\nthe building surveyors are also capable on establishment of bills of quantities for the new works and renovation or maintenance or rehabilitation works.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe profession of Building Surveyor does not exist in the US. The title Surveyor refers almost exclusively to Land surveyors. Architects, Building Designers, Residential Designers, Construction Managers, and Home Inspectors perform some or all of the work of the U.K. Building Surveyor.","input":"What is a person who designs buildings called?"},{"output":"Sally Kristen Ride","context":"Sally Kristen Ride (May 26, 1951?ÿ July 23, 2012) was an American physicist and astronaut. Born in Los Angeles, she joined NASA in 1978 and became the first American woman in space in 1983. Ride was the third woman in space overall, after USSR cosmonauts Valentina Tereshkova (1963) and Svetlana Savitskaya (1982). Ride remains the youngest American astronaut to have traveled to space, having done so at the age of 32.[1][2] After flying twice on the Orbiter Challenger, she left NASA in 1987. She worked for two years at Stanford University's Center for International Security and Arms Control, then at the University of California, San Diego as a professor of physics, primarily researching nonlinear optics and Thomson scattering. She served on the committees that investigated the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters, the only person to participate in both.[3][4] Ride died of pancreatic cancer on July 23, 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elder child of Dale Burdell Ride and Carol Joyce Ride (ne Anderson), Ride was born in Los Angeles. She had one sibling, Karen \\"Bear\\" Ride, who is a Presbyterian minister. Both parents were elders in the Presbyterian Church. Ride's mother had worked as a volunteer counselor at a women's correctional facility. Her father had been a political science professor at Santa Monica College.[3]\\r\\nRide attended Portola Junior High (now Portola Middle School) and then Birmingham High School before graduating from the private Westlake School for Girls in Los Angeles on a scholarship.[3] In addition to being interested in science, she was a nationally ranked tennis player. Ride attended Swarthmore College for three semesters, took physics courses at University of California, Los Angeles, and then entered Stanford University as a junior, graduating with a bachelor's degree in English and physics. At Stanford, she earned a master's degree in 1975 and a PhD in physics in 1978 while doing research on the interaction of X-rays with the interstellar medium.[5] Astrophysics and free electron lasers were her specific areas of study.[6]\\r\\nRide was one of 8,000 people who answered an advertisement in the Stanford student newspaper seeking applicants for the space program.[7] She was chosen to join NASA in 1978.[8] During her career, Ride served as the ground-based capsule communicator (CapCom) for the second and third space shuttle flights (STS-2 and STS-3) and helped develop the space shuttle's \\"Canadarm\\" robot arm.[8]\\r\\nPrior to her first space flight, she was subject to media attention due to her gender. During a press conference, she was asked questions such as, \\"Will the flight affect your reproductive organs?\\" and \\"Do you weep when things go wrong on the job?\\" Despite this and the historical significance of the mission, Ride insisted that she saw herself in only one wayas an astronaut.[8] On June 18, 1983, she became the first American woman in space as a crew member on space shuttle Challenger for STS-7. She was preceded by two Soviet women, Valentina Tereshkova in 1963 and Svetlana Savitskaya in 1982. The five-person crew of the STS-7 mission deployed two communications satellites and conducted pharmaceutical experiments. Ride was the first woman to use the robot arm in space and the first to use the arm to retrieve a satellite.[5]\\r\\nHer second space flight was STS-41-G in 1984, also on board Challenger. She spent a total of more than 343 hours in space. Ride had completed eight months of training for her third flight (STS-61-M, a TDRS deployment mission) when the space shuttle Challenger disaster occurred. She was named to the Rogers Commission (the presidential commission investigating the accident) and headed its subcommittee on operations. She was the only person to serve on both of the panels investigating shuttle accidents (those for the Challenger accident and later the Columbia disaster). Following the Challenger investigation, Ride was assigned to NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C., where she led NASA's first strategic planning effort, authored a report titled \\"NASA Leadership and America's Future in Space\\" and founded NASA's Office of Exploration.[5] After Sally Ride's death in 2012, General Donald Kutyna revealed that she had discreetly provided him with key information about O-rings (namely, that they become stiff at low temperatures) that eventually led to identification of the cause of the explosion.[9]\\r\\nIn 1987, Ride left her position in Washington, D.C., to work at the Stanford University Center for International Security and Arms Control. In 1989, she became a professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego, and director of the California Space Institute. From the mid-1990s until her death, Ride led two public-outreach programs for NASAthe ISS EarthKAM and GRAIL MoonKAM projects, in cooperation with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and UCSD. The programs allowed middle school students to request images of the Earth[10] and moon.[11] In 1999, she acted in the season 5 finale of Touched by an Angel, titled \\"Godspeed\\".[citation needed] In 2003, she was asked to serve on the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. She was the president and CEO of Sally Ride Science, a company she co-founded in 2001 that creates entertaining science programs and publications for upper elementary and middle school students, with a particular focus on girls.[12][13][14]\\r\\nAccording to Roger Boisjoly, the engineer who warned of the technical problems that led to the Challenger disaster, after the entire workforce of Morton-Thiokol shunned him Ride was the only public figure to show support for him when he went public with his pre-disaster warnings. Sally Ride hugged him publicly to show her support for his efforts.[15]\\r\\nRide wrote or co-wrote seven books[16] on space aimed at children, with the goal of encouraging children to study science.[17][18]\\r\\nRide endorsed Barack Obama for U.S. President in 2008.[19][20] She was a member of the Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee, an independent review requested by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) on May 7, 2009.\\r\\nRide was extremely private about her personal life. In 1982, she married fellow NASA astronaut Steve Hawley. They divorced in 1987.[21]\\r\\nAfter Ride's death, her obituary revealed that her partner of 27 years was Tam O'Shaughnessy, a professor emerita of school psychology at San Diego State University and childhood friend, who met her when both were aspiring tennis players.[22][23] O'Shaughnessy was also a science writer and, later, the co-founder of Sally Ride Science.[24][25] O'Shaughnessy now serves as the Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board of Sally Ride Science.[26] They wrote six acclaimed children's science books together.[16] Their relationship was revealed by the company and confirmed by her sister, who said she chose to keep her personal life private, including her sickness and treatments.[27][28] She is the first known LGBT astronaut.[29][30]\\r\\nRide died on July 23, 2012, at the age of 61, in her home in La Jolla, California,[31] seventeen months after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.[3][32][33][34] Following cremation, her ashes were interred next to her father[35] at Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery, Santa Monica.\\r\\nRide received numerous awards throughout her lifetime and after. She received the National Space Society's von Braun Award, the Lindbergh Eagle, and the NCAA's Theodore Roosevelt Award. She was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame and the Astronaut Hall of Fame and was awarded the NASA Space Flight Medal twice. Two elementary schools in the United States are named after her: Sally Ride Elementary School in The Woodlands, Texas, and Sally Ride Elementary School in Germantown, Maryland.[5]\\r\\nIn 1994, Ride received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.[36]\\r\\nOn December 6, 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Ride into the California Hall of Fame at the California Museum for History, Women, and the Arts.[37]\\r\\nIn 2007, she was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio.\\r\\nRide directed public outreach and educational programs for NASA's GRAIL mission, which sent twin satellites to map the moons gravity. On December 17, 2012, the two GRAIL probes, Ebb and Flow, were directed to complete their mission by crashing on an unnamed lunar mountain near the crater Goldschmidt. NASA announced that it was naming the landing site in honor of Sally Ride.[38][39]\\r\\nIn April 2013, the U.S. Navy announced that a research ship would be named in honor of Ride.[40] This was done in 2014 with the christening of the oceanographic research vessel RV Sally Ride (AGOR-28).[41]\\r\\nOn May 20, 2013, a \\"National Tribute to Sally Ride\\" was held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.\\r\\nAlso on May 20, 2013, President Barack Obama announced that Ride would receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. The medal was presented to her life partner Tam O'Shaughnessy in a ceremony at the White House on November 20, 2013.[42][43]\\r\\nAlso in 2013, Flying magazine ranked Ride at number 50 on their list of the \\"51 Heroes of Aviation\\".[44]\\r\\nAlso in 2013, the Space Foundation bestowed upon Ride its highest honor, the General James E.

The stadium has a seating capacity of 44,494, and contains 3,706 club seats and 61 luxury suites. It replaced Busch Memorial Stadium (aka Busch Stadium II) and occupies a portion of that stadium's former footprint. A commercial area, dubbed Ballpark Village, was built adjacent to the stadium over the remainder of the former stadium's footprint.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium opened on April 4, 2006 with an exhibition between the minor league Memphis Redbirds and Springfield Cardinals, both affiliates of the St. Louis Cardinals, which Springfield won 5-3 with right-hander Mike Parisi recording the first win. The first official major league game occurred on April 10, 2006 as the Cardinals defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 6ÿ4 behind an Albert Pujols home run and winning pitcher Mark Mulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest attendance for a sports event was on May 23, 2013, when 48,263 people watched Chelsea Football Club and Manchester City Football Club play a friendly match.[16]  To date, the largest attendance for a baseball game occurred July 29, 2017 with an attendance of 48,052 in a game between the Cardinals and the Arizona Diamondbacks.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium is the third stadium in St. Louis to carry the name Busch Stadium. Sportsman's Park was renamed Busch Stadium in 1953, after team owner Gussie Busch. The first Busch Stadium closed in 1966 and both the baseball Cardinals, and the National Football League (NFL)'s team of the same name (now the Arizona Cardinals) moved to a new multi-purpose stadium, named Busch Memorial Stadium. However, the current stadium is actually a corporate name and named after Anheuser-Busch, not Gussie Busch. The naming rights deal was signed in 2004 and would extend from the stadium's opening in 2006 until 2026.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, St. Louis Cardinals team ownership began to lobby for a new ballpark in downtown St. Louis, but the team was unable to acquire funding for the project for several years. In June 2001, the Missouri state government signed a contract with the team, proposing a ballpark in downtown St. Louis, but a subsequent funding bill was struck down in May 2002, leaving the saga open.[18][19]  Team owners sought a location near Madison, Illinois, adjacent to Gateway International Raceway, until the city of St. Louis drafted a financing plan for the team to construct the new stadium in downtown St. Louis.[20]  The stadium was financed through private bonds, bank loans, a long-term loan from St. Louis County, and money from the team owners. The development, including the Ballpark Village was projected to cost approximately $665 million with the stadium alone costing $365 million.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Busch Stadium was designed by Populous (then known as HOK Sport) and built by Hunt Construction with an estimated cost of $344.8 million, which proved too low by $20.2 million to its final cost of $365 million.[10] Populous' senior project designer for Busch Stadium was Jim Chibnall, who was also the lead designer of Progressive Field in Cleveland, Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, Sydney Olympic Stadium and other notable stadiums throughout the world.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe field level (16,880 seats), terrace level (9,150), and bleachers (3,661) were completed in time for opening day, with total capacity on that day of 37,962, not including up to 2,751 standing room tickets.[22] An integrated LED video and scoring system from Daktronics was installed in the stadium prior to its opening, featuring a video display measuring 32 feet high by 52 feet wide and three message displays, as well as more than 100 feet of digital ribbon board technology.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction on the seating area was completed in late May increasing the capacity for the May 29, 2006 game vs the Houston Astros with finishing touches performed throughout the year.[22] Including all 2,886 standing-room-only tickets for the general public and the suites and party rooms, the stadium's total capacity is 46,861. Natural grass turf was installed in March 2006.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the stadium's debut season every Cardinal game was sold out, giving a total attendance of 3,407,104 for the season, the second-largest in team history,[24] but since surpassed in both 2007, 2008, and 2014-2017.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first season of the new stadium, the Cardinals beat the Detroit Tigers in 5 games to capture their 10th World Series title.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusch Stadium hosted only one postseason game in 2009, a 5ÿ1 loss versus the Los Angeles Dodgers on October 10, to complete a sweep of the Cardinals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, Busch Stadium hosted two postseason games in the National League Division Series versus the Philadelphia Phillies. On October 4, the Phillies won 3ÿ2, to take a 2ÿ1 game lead over the Cardinals. The next night, the 5th, the Cardinals beat the Phillies 5ÿ3 to tie the series at 2 games apiece. In the NLCS versus the Milwaukee Brewers, the Cardinals won 2 of the three games they played at home (Games 3, 4, 5). The Cards ended up winning the series on the road in Milwaukee to advance to the World Series. (This was the second time the Cardinals had defeated the Brewers in a postseason series, the first being the 1982 World Series, when Milwaukee was represented as an American League team; the Brewers switched over to the National League in 1998.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the National League had won the 2011 MLB All-Star Game, home field advantage went to the Cardinals as the National League champions, thus allowing the team to host the Texas Rangers for Games 1, 2, 6 and 7. Game 1 was won by the Cardinals on October 19, along with Game 6 on October 27, in a game won in walk-off fashion by a David Freese home run, then the deciding Game 7, which was taken by the Cardinals in a 6-2 final, giving the team the 2011 World Series title.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusch Stadium hosted two postseason games vs. the Washington Nationals in the 2012 National League Division Series. The two teams split the two games at Busch, before the Cardinals won two of the next three games at Nationals Park. The Cardinals then won the first two home games against the San Francisco Giants to take a 3ÿ1 series lead, but lost Game 5 and went on to lose the series in Game 7 at AT&T Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cardinals hosted nine postseason games at Busch Stadium in 2013. In the National League Division Series, they won Games 1 and 5 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, with the latter game capping off a series comeback after trailing 2ÿ1. They would win every home game of the NLCS against the Dodgers, including a 9ÿ0 shutout win in Game 6 to take the series 4ÿ2. In the World Series, the Cardinals hosted Games 3ÿ5 against the Boston Red Sox. Game 3 on October 26 ended in an obstruction call when Allen Craig was impeded by Will Middlebrooks at third base, thus awarding him a run after umpire Jim Joyce ruled obstruction on the play. The next night Game 4 ended on a successful pickoff by Koji Uehara on pinch-runner Kolten Wong at first base. The Cardinals led 2ÿ1 after the controversial Game 3 win, but proceeded to lose the next three games to lose the series 4ÿ2.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cardinals played two games in Busch Stadium against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series. The first two games of the Series were played at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, and the teams each won a game there. The Series then moved to Busch Stadium, and the Cardinals won the next two games, to win the Series 3-1 and advance to the National League Championship Series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cardinals opened the National League Championship Series at Busch Stadium on October 11, 2014, against the San Francisco Giants.  The teams split games 1 and 2 played at Busch Stadium, and the Series moved to AT&T Park in San Francisco. The Giants won games 3, 4, and 5 in their home ballpark, to defeat the Cardinals in the NLCS 4-1, and move on to an appearance in the 2014 World Series against the Kansas City Royals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cardinals hosted two postseason games at Busch Stadium in 2015. In the National League Division Series, they won game 1 on October 9, 2015, but lost game 2 against the Chicago Cubs. The Cardinals then lost games 3 and 4 to the Cubs at Wrigley Field to lose the series 3-1.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium hosted the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game on July 14, 2009. The American League defeated the National League in that game, 4-3. Tampa Bay Rays outfielder Carl Crawford won MVP. President Barack Obama threw out the ceremonial first pitch wearing a Chicago White Sox jacket.\\r\\n\\r\\nMissouri has recently started to play one game a year at Busch. In 2009, they defeated SLU, and in 2010, they defeated Illinois in a Braggin' Rights matchup.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cardinals have allowed local high school teams to play each other on the field following select weekend afternoon games. So far, only 2 homeruns have been hit high school students. The first was on May 7, 2011 by Johnny Wilson of Marquette Catholic High School against Farmington High School.[citation needed] The second was on April 21, 2018 by Zach Hilboldt of De Smet Jesuit High school against Palmyra High School.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusch Stadium hosted an exhibition soccer game on May 23, 2013 between Manchester City and Chelsea of the English Premier League.[26] Tickets for the match sold out within 20 minutes of going on sale,[27] and Manchester City won 4-3 in front of an enthusiastic standing-room crowd of 48,263, to date the largest attendance at a sporting event at the stadium.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater that year on November 18, Busch hosted a friendly between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Argentina; before a crowd of more than 30,000, many of which were members of St. Louis' large Bosniak community, Argentina beat Bosnia 2-0, with Sergio Agero scoring both goals.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 4, 2015 the United States Women's National Soccer Team defeated New Zealand 4-0 in front of over 35,000 fans, the largest stand-alone crowd for a USWNT friendly in history.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 13, 2015 the United States Men's National Soccer Team defeated St. Vincent and the Grenadines 6-1 in the first match of the fourth round of qualifiers for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in front of a crowd of 43,433.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother international friendly was hosted at Busch in 2016: Italian side A.S.

Like all those, it offers a panoramic view of the downtown skyline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gate 3 entrance on the west side of the stadium is most iconic, with a large \\"bridge\\" resembling the Eads Bridge arching over the entrance. The exterior of the stadium contains historical plaques of Cardinals logos, the STL insignia and a Busch Stadium logo behind home plate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter complaints from fans that not all out-of-town games could be placed on the Daktronics out-of-town scoreboard at one time, following the inaugural season a number of advertisement panels were removed to expand the scoreboard and also create a secondary video board. In 2016, the entire original scoreboard and fascia-board system was replaced, creating two full HD video boards: the main board, which took up the entire area of the original scoreboard and video board, measures 4,800 sq ft (40?ft x 120?ft), with the out-of-town scoreboard measuring 3,280 sq ft (40 x 81?ft).[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside the Gate 3 entrance stands a bronze statue of Cardinals legend Stan \\"The Man\\" Musial. Other Cardinals statues that previously surrounded Busch Memorial Stadium are now displayed at the corner of Clark and 8th streets, outside the Cardinals' team store. The statues are of former Cardinal players and Hall of Fame inductees Enos Slaughter, Dizzy Dean, Rogers Hornsby, Red Schoendienst, Lou Brock, Bob Gibson and Ozzie Smith; former St. Louis Browns player and Hall of Fame inductee George Sisler; former Negro league St. Louis Stars player and Hall of Fame inductee Cool Papa Bell; and former Cardinals radio broadcaster and Hall of Fame honoree Jack Buck.\\r\\n\\r\\nFans at the stadium have access to a large amount of food and drink options, ranging from standard ballpark fare like bratwurst, nachos and peanuts to St Louis-area favorites such as pork steak sandwiches and toasted ravioli. Budweiser holds the beer contract for the stadium as one would expect, but local craft breweries such as Saint Louis Brewery, Urban Chestnut, and 4 Hands all are available at multiple outlets. Tickets for multiple all-inclusive areas are sold on a single game basis, with amenities running the gamut from the ritzy Champions Club (offering a multiple-course buffet, large screen televisions, a chance to get on television or radio as a broadcast booth is located inside the club, and a full bar) to the more family-oriented Scoreboard Patio (with table seating for four in center field and a cookout-style selection of food). Cardinal management also allows outside food and drink (including soft-sided drink coolers); as a result, it is not uncommon to see vendors selling discounted bags of peanuts and bottles of soda and water, or even scalpers including a box of Cracker Jack with tickets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ballpark features a make-your-own-mascot store featuring Fredbird, the Cardinals' team mascot.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter St. Louis Post-Dispatch sportswriter Rick Hummel was honored with the J. G.

Indeed, the smallest extant bird species is a hummingbird, the 5?cm (2.0?in) bee hummingbird weighing less than 2.0?g (0.07?oz).\\r\\nThey are known as hummingbirds because of the humming sound created by their beating wings which flap at high frequencies audible to humans. They hover in mid-air at rapid wing-flapping rates, which vary from around 12 beats per second in the largest species, to in excess of 80 in some of the smallest. Of those species that have been measured in wind tunnels, their top speed exceeds 15?m/s (54?km/h; 34?mph) and some species can dive at speeds in excess of 22?m/s (79?km/h; 49?mph).[1][2]\\r\\nHummingbirds have the highest metabolism of any homeothermic animal.[3] To conserve energy when food is scarce, and nightly when not foraging, they can go into torpor, a state similar to hibernation, slowing metabolic rate to 1/15th of its normal rate.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA map of the hummingbird family treereconstructed from analysis of 284 of the world's 338 known speciesshows rapid diversification from 22 million years ago.[5] Hummingbirds fall into nine main clades, the Topazes, Hermits, Mangoes, Brilliants, Coquettes, Patagona, Mountain Gems, Bees, and Emeralds, defining their relationship to nectar-bearing flowering plants and the birds' continued spread into new geographic areas.[5][6][7][8]\\r\\nWhile all hummingbirds depend on flower nectar to fuel their high metabolisms and hovering flight, coordinated changes in flower- and bill shape stimulated the formation of new species of hummingbirds and plants. Due to this exceptional evolutionary pattern, as many as 140 hummingbird species can coexist in a specific region, such as the Andes range.[5]\\r\\nThe hummingbird evolutionary tree shows ancestral hummingbirds splitting from insectivorous swifts (family Apodidae) and treeswifts (family Hemiprocnidae) about 42 million years ago, probably in Eurasia.[5] One key evolutionary factor appears to be an altered taste receptor that enabled hummingbirds to seek nectar.[9] By 22 million years ago the ancestral species of current hummingbirds became established in South America, where environmental conditions stimulated further diversification.[5]\\r\\nThe Andes Mountains appear to be a particularly rich environment for hummingbird evolution because diversification occurred simultaneously with mountain uplift over the past 10 million years.[5] Hummingbirds remain in dynamic diversification inhabiting ecological regions across South America, North America, and the Caribbean, indicating an enlarging evolutionary radiation.[5]\\r\\nWithin the same geographic region, hummingbird clades co-evolved with nectar-bearing plant clades, affecting mechanisms of pollination.[10][11] The same is true for the sword-billed hummingbird (Ensifera ensifera), one of the morphologically most extreme species, and one of its main food plant clades (Passiflora section Tacsonia).[12]\\r\\nHummingbirds exhibit sexual size dimorphism according to Rensch's rule,[13] in which males are smaller than females in small species, and males are larger than females in large-bodied species.[14] The extent of this sexual size difference varies among clades of hummingbirds.[14][15] For example, the Mellisugini clade exhibits a large size dimorphism, with females being larger than males.[15] Conversely, the Lophomithini clade displays very little size dimorphism; males and females are similar in size.[15] Sexual dimorphisms in bill size and shape are also present between male and female hummingbirds,[15] where in many clades, females have longer, more curved bills favored for accessing nectar from tall flowers.[16] For males and females of the same size, females will tend to have larger bills.[15]\\r\\nSexual size and bill differences likely evolved due to constraints imposed by courtship because mating displays of male hummingbirds require complex aerial maneuvers.[13] Males tend to be smaller than females, allowing conservation of energy to forage competitively and participate more frequently in courtship.[13] Thus, sexual selection will favor smaller male hummingbirds.[13]\\r\\nFemale hummingbirds tend to be larger, requiring more energy, with longer beaks that allow for more effective reach into crevices of tall flowers for nectar.[16] Thus females are better at foraging, acquiring flower nectar, and supporting the energy demands of their larger body size.[16] Directional selection will thus favor the larger hummingbirds in terms of acquiring food.[14]\\r\\nAnother evolutionary cause of this sexual bill dimorphism is that the selective forces from competition for nectar between the sexes of each species are what drive the sexual dimorphism.[15] Depending on which sex holds territory in the species, it is advantageous for the other sex to have a longer bill and be able to feed on a wide variety of flowers, decreasing intraspecific competition.[16] For example, in species of hummingbirds where males have longer bills, males do not hold a specific territory and have a lek mating system.[16] In species where males have shorter bills than females, males defend their resources and therefore females must have a longer bill in order to feed from a broader range of flower.[16]\\r\\nHummingbirds are specialized nectarivores[17] and are tied to the ornithophilous flowers upon which they feed. Some species, especially those with unusual bill shapes such as the sword-billed hummingbird and the sicklebills, are co-evolved with a small number of flower species. The bee hummingbird (Mellisuga helenae) ÿ the world's smallest bird ÿ evolved to dwarfism likely because it had to compete with long-billed hummingbirds having an advantage for nectar foraging from specialized flowers, consequently leading the bee hummingbird to more successfully compete for flower foraging against insects.[18][19]\\r\\nMany plants pollinated by hummingbirds produce flowers in shades of red, orange, and bright pink, though the birds will take nectar from flowers of other colors as well. Hummingbirds can see wavelengths into the near-ultraviolet, but hummingbird-pollinated flowers do not reflect these wavelengths as many insect-pollinated flowers do. This narrow color spectrum may render hummingbird-pollinated flowers relatively inconspicuous to most insects, thereby reducing nectar robbing.[20][21] Hummingbird-pollinated flowers also produce relatively weak nectar (averaging 25% sugars w/w) containing a high proportion of sucrose, whereas insect-pollinated flowers typically produce more concentrated nectars dominated by fructose and glucose.[22]\\r\\nUpon maturity, males of one species, Phaethornis longirostris, the long-billed hermit, appear to be evolving a dagger-like weapon on the beak tip as a secondary sexual trait to defend mating areas.[23]\\r\\nIn traditional taxonomy, hummingbirds are placed in the order Apodiformes, which also contains the swifts. However, some taxonomists have separated them into their own order, the Trochiliformes. Hummingbirds' wing bones are hollow and fragile, making fossilization difficult and leaving their evolutionary history poorly documented. Though scientists theorize that hummingbirds originated in South America, where species diversity is greatest, possible ancestors of extant hummingbirds may have lived in parts of Europe to what is southern Russia today.[24]\\r\\nBetween 325 and 340 species of hummingbirds are described, depending on taxonomic viewpoint, divided into two subfamilies, the hermits (subfamily Phaethornithinae, 34 species in six genera), and the typical hummingbirds (subfamily Trochilinae, all the others). However, recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that this division is slightly inaccurate, and that there are nine major clades of hummingbirds: the topazes and jacobins, the hermits, the mangoes, the coquettes, the brilliants, the giant hummingbird (Patagona gigas), the mountain-gems, the bees, and the emeralds.[6] The topazes and jacobins combined have the oldest split with the rest of the hummingbirds. The hummingbird family has the second-greatest number of species of any bird family (after the tyrant flycatchers).\\r\\nFossil hummingbirds are known from the Pleistocene of Brazil and the Bahamas; however, neither has yet been scientifically described, and fossils and subfossils of a few extant species are known. Until recently, older fossils had not been securely identifiable as those of hummingbirds.\\r\\nIn 2004, Dr Gerald Mayr of the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt am Main identified two 30-million-year-old hummingbird fossils.[25] The fossils of this primitive hummingbird species, named Eurotrochilus inexpectatus (\\"unexpected European hummingbird\\"), had been sitting in a museum drawer in Stuttgart; they had been unearthed in a clay pit at WieslochÿFrauenweiler, south of Heidelberg, Germany, and because it was assumed that hummingbirds never occurred outside the Americas, were not recognized to be hummingbirds until Mayr took a closer look at them.\\r\\nFossils of birds not clearly assignable to either hummingbirds or a related, extinct family, the Jungornithidae, have been found at the Messel pit and in the Caucasus, dating from 40ÿ35 mya; this indicates that the split between these two lineages indeed occurred at that date. The areas where these early fossils have been found had a climate quite similar to that of the northern Caribbean or southernmost China during that time. The biggest remaining mystery at the present time is what happened to hummingbirds in the roughly 25 million years between the primitive Eurotrochilus and the modern fossils. The astounding morphological adaptations, the decrease in size, and the dispersal to the Americas and extinction in Eurasia all occurred during this timespan. DNA-DNA hybridization results[26] suggest that the main radiation of South American hummingbirds took place at least partly in the Miocene, some 12 to 13 million years ago, during the uplifting of the northern Andes.\\r\\nIn 2013, a 50-million-year-old fossil bird unearthed in Wyoming was found to be a predecessor to both hummingbirds and swifts before the groups diverged.[27]\\r\\nDuring evolution, hummingbirds have adapted to the navigational needs of visual processing while in rapid flight or hovering by development of an exceptionally dense array of retinal neurons allowing for increased spatial resolution in the lateral and frontal visual fields.[28] Morphological studies showed that neuronal hypertrophy, relatively the largest in any bird, exists in a brain region called the pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali (or nucleus of the optic tract in mammals) responsible for refining dynamic visual processing while hovering and during rapid flight.[29][30] The enlargement of this brain region responsible for visual processing indicates enhanced ability for perception and processing of fast-moving visual stimuli which hummingbirds encounter during rapid forward flight, insect foraging, competitive interactions, and high-speed courtship.[30][31]\\r\\nHummingbirds are highly sensitive to stimuli in their visual fields, responding to even minimal motion in any direction by reorienting themselves in midflight.[30][31][32] Hummingbirds' visual sensitivity allows them to precisely hover in place while in complex and dynamic natural environments,[32] functions enabled by the lentiform nucleus which is tuned to fast-pattern velocities, enabling highly tuned control and collision avoidance during forward flight.[30]\\r\\nWith the exception of insects, hummingbirds while in flight have the highest metabolism of all animals ÿ a necessity to support the rapid beating of their wings during hovering and fast forward flight.[3][33] Their heart rate can reach as high as 1,260 beats per minute, a rate once measured in a blue-throated hummingbird, with a breathing rate of 250 breaths per minute, even at rest.[34][35] During flight, oxygen consumption per gram of muscle tissue in a hummingbird is about 10 times higher than that measured in elite human athletes.[3]\\r\\nHummingbirds are rare among vertebrates in their ability to rapidly make use of ingested sugars to fuel energetically expensive hovering flight,[36] powering up to 100% of their metabolic needs with the sugars they drink (in comparison, human athletes max out at around 30%). Hummingbirds can use newly ingested sugars to fuel hovering flight within 30ÿ45 minutes of consumption.[37][38] These data suggest that hummingbirds are able to oxidize sugar in flight muscles at rates high enough to satisfy their extreme metabolic demands. By relying on newly ingested sugars to fuel flight, hummingbirds can reserve their limited fat stores to sustain their overnight fasting or to power migratory flights.[37]\\r\\nStudies of hummingbirds' metabolisms are relevant to the question of how a migrating ruby-throated hummingbird can cross 800?km (500?mi) of the Gulf of Mexico on a nonstop flight.[35] This hummingbird, like other birds preparing to migrate, stores fat as a fuel reserve, thereby augmenting its weight by as much as 100%, hence increasing potential flying time over open water.[35][39]\\r\\nThe dynamic range of metabolic rates in hummingbirds[40] requires a parallel dynamic range in kidney function.[41] During a day of nectar consumption with corresponding high water intake that may total five times the body weight per day, hummingbird kidneys process water via glomerular filtration rates (GFR) in amounts proportional to water consumption, thereby avoiding overhydration.[41][42] During brief periods of water deprivation, however, such as in nighttime torpor, GFR ceases, preserving body water.[41][42]\\r\\nHummingbird kidneys also have a unique ability to control the levels of electrolytes after consuming nectars with high amounts of sodium and chloride or none, indicating that kidney and glomerular structures must be highly specialized for variations in nectar mineral quality.[43] Morphological studies on Anna's hummingbird kidneys showed adaptations of high capillary density in close proximity to nephrons, allowing for precise regulation of water and electrolytes.[42][44]\\r\\nDuring turbulent airflow conditions created experimentally in a wind tunnel, hummingbirds exhibit stable head positions and orientation when they hover at a feeder. When wind gusts from the side, hummingbirds compensate by increasing the amplitude of their wing strokes plane angle and by varying the orientation and enlarging the collective surface area of their tail feathers into the shape of a fan.[45] While hovering, the visual system of a hummingbird is able to separate apparent motion caused by the movement of the hummingbird itself from motions caused by external sources, such as an approaching predator.[32] In natural settings full of highly complex background motion, hummingbirds are able to precisely hover in place by rapid coordination of vision with body position.[32]\\r\\nConsisting of chirps, squeaks, whistles and buzzes,[46] hummingbird songs originate from at least seven specialized nuclei in the forebrain.[47][48] In a genetic expression study, it was shown that these nuclei enable vocal learning (ability to acquire vocalizations through imitation), a rare trait known to occur in only two other groups of birds (parrots and songbirds) and a few groups of mammals (including humans, whales and dolphins and bats).[47] Within the past 66 million years, only hummingbirds, parrots and songbirds out of 23 bird orders may have independently evolved seven similar forebrain structures for singing and vocal learning, indicating that evolution of these structures is under strong epigenetic constraints possibly derived from a common ancestor.[47][49]\\r\\nThe blue-throated hummingbirds song differs from typical oscine songs in its wide frequency range, extending from 1.8?kHz to approximately 30?kHz.[50] It also produces ultrasonic vocalizations which do not function in communication.[50] As blue-throated hummingbirds often alternate singing with catching small ?ying insects, it is possible the ultrasonic clicks produced during singing disrupt insect ?ight patterns, making insects more vulnerable to predation.[50]\\r\\nThe metabolism of hummingbirds can slow at night or at any time when food is not readily available: the birds enter a hibernation-like, deep-sleep state (known as torpor) to prevent energy reserves from falling to a critical level. During night-time torpor, body temperature falls from 40 to 18?C,[51] with heart and breathing rates both slowed dramatically (heart rate to roughly 50 to 180 beats per minute from its daytime rate of higher than 1000).[52]\\r\\nDuring torpor, to prevent dehydration, the GFR ceases, preserving needed compounds such as glucose, water, and nutrients.[41] Further, body mass declines throughout nocturnal torpor at a rate of 0.04 g per hour, amounting to about 10% of weight loss each night.[41] The circulating hormone, corticosterone, is one signal that arouses a hummingbird from torpor.[53]\\r\\nUse and duration of torpor vary among hummingbird species and are affected by whether a dominant bird defends territory, with nonterritorial subordinate birds having longer periods of torpor.[54]\\r\\nHummingbirds have long lifespans for organisms with such rapid metabolisms. Though many die during their first year of life, especially in the vulnerable period between hatching and fledging, those that survive may occasionally live a decade or more.[55] Among the better-known North American species, the average lifespan is probably 3 to 5 years.[55] For comparison, the smaller shrews, among the smallest of all mammals, seldom live longer than 2 years.[56] The longest recorded lifespan in the wild relates to a female broad-tailed hummingbird that was banded (ringed) as an adult at least one year old, then recaptured 11 years later, making her at least 12 years old.[citation needed] Other longevity records for banded hummingbirds include an estimated minimum age of 10 years 1 month for a female black-chinned hummingbird similar in size to the broad-tailed hummingbird, and at least 11 years 2 months for a much larger buff-bellied hummingbird.[57]\\r\\nAs far as is known, male hummingbirds do not take part in nesting.[58] Most species build a cup-shaped nest on the branch of a tree or shrub,[59] although a few tropical species normally attach their nests to leaves.[citation needed] The nest varies in size relative to the particular speciesfrom smaller than half a walnut shell to several centimeters in diameter.[58][60]\\r\\nMany hummingbird species use spider silk and lichen to bind the nest material together and secure the structure.[59][61] The unique properties of the silk allow the nest to expand as the young hummingbirds grow.[59][60] Two white eggs are laid,[59][61] which despite being the smallest of all bird eggs, are in fact large relative to the adult hummingbird's size.[60] Incubation lasts 14 to 23 days,[61] depending on the species, ambient temperature, and female attentiveness to the nest.[58] The mother feeds her nestlings on small arthropods and nectar by inserting her bill into the open mouth of a nestling, and then regurgitating the food into its crop.[58][60]\\r\\nIncubating in Copiap܇,

toothpick for scale\\r\\nTo serve courtship and territorial competition, many male hummingbirds have plumage with bright, varied coloration[62] resulting both from pigmentation in the feathers and from prism-like cells within the top layers of feathers of the head, gorget, breast, back and wings.[63] When sunlight hits these cells, it is split into wavelengths that reflect to the observer in varying degrees of intensity,[63] with the feather structure acting as a diffraction grating.[63] Iridescent hummingbird colors result from a combination of refraction and pigmentation, since the diffraction structures themselves are made of melanin, a pigment,[62] and may also be colored by carotenoid pigmentation and more subdued black, brown or gray colors dependent on melanin.[63]\\r\\nBy merely shifting position, feather regions of a muted-looking bird can instantly become fiery red or vivid green.[63] In courtship displays for one example, males of the colorful Anna's hummingbird orient their bodies and feathers toward the sun to enhance the display value of iridescent plumage toward a female of interest.[64]\\r\\nOne study of Anna's hummingbirds found that dietary protein was an influential factor in feather color, as birds receiving more protein grew significantly more colorful crown feathers than those fed a low-protein diet.[65] Additionally, birds on a high-protein diet grew yellower (higher hue) green tail feathers than birds on a low-protein diet.[65]\\r\\nHummingbird flight has been studied intensively from an aerodynamic perspective using wind tunnels and high-speed video cameras.\\r\\nTwo studies of rufous or Anna's hummingbirds in a wind tunnel used particle image velocimetry techniques to investigate the lift generated on the bird's upstroke and downstroke.[67][68] The birds produced 75% of their weight support during the downstroke and 25% during the upstroke, with the wings making a \\"figure 8\\" motion.[69]\\r\\nMany earlier studies had assumed that lift was generated equally during the two phases of the wingbeat cycle, as is the case of insects of a similar size.[67] This finding shows that hummingbird hovering is similar to, but distinct from, that of hovering insects such as the hawk moth.[67] Further studies using electromyography in hovering rufous hummingbirds showed that muscle strain in the pectoralis major (principal downstroke muscle) was the lowest yet recorded in a flying bird, and the primary upstroke muscle (supracoracoideus) is proportionately larger than in other bird species.[70]\\r\\nBecause of their flying technique, these birds no longer have an alula, while the alula digit has evolved to become absent.[71]\\r\\nThe giant hummingbird's wings beat as few as 12 beats per second[72] and the wings of typical hummingbirds beat up to 80 times per second.[73]\\r\\nA slow-motion video has shown how the hummingbirds deal with rain when they are flying. To remove the water from their heads, they shake their heads and bodies, similar to a dog shaking, to shed water.[74] Further, when raindrops collectively may weigh as much as 38% of the bird's body weight, hummingbirds shift their bodies and tails horizontally, beat their wings faster, and reduce their wings' angle of motion when flying in heavy rain.[75]\\r\\nWhen courting, the male Anna's hummingbird ascends some 35 meters before diving over an interested female at a speed of 27?m/s, equal to 385 body lengths/second, producing a high-pitched sound.[76] This downward acceleration during a dive is the highest reported for any vertebrate undergoing a voluntary aerial maneuver; in addition to acceleration, the speed, relative to body length, is the largest known for any vertebrate. For instance, it is about twice the diving speed of peregrine falcons in pursuit of prey.[76] At maximum descent speed, about 10?g of gravitational force occurs in the courting hummingbird during a dive.[76] By comparison to humans, this is a g-force acceleration causing near loss of consciousness in fighter pilots during flight of fixed-wing aircraft in a high-speed banked turn.[76][77]\\r\\nThe outer tail feathers of male Anna's (Calypte anna) and Selasphorus hummingbirds (e.g., Allen's, calliope) vibrate during courtship display dives and produce an audible chirp caused by aeroelastic flutter.[78][79] Hummingbirds cannot make the courtship dive sound when missing their outer tail feathers, and those same feathers could produce the dive-sound in a wind tunnel.[78] The bird can sing at the same frequency as the tail feather chirp, but its small syrinx is not capable of the same volume.[80] The sound is caused by the aerodynamics of rapid air flow past tail feathers, causing them to flutter in a vibration which produces the high-pitched sound of a courtship dive.[78][81]\\r\\nMany other species of hummingbirds also produce sounds with their wings or tails while flying, hovering or diving, including the wings of the calliope hummingbird,[82] broad-tailed hummingbird, rufous hummingbird, Allen's hummingbird, and streamertail, as well as the tail of the Costa's hummingbird and the black-chinned hummingbird, and a number of related species.[83] The harmonics of sounds during courtship dives vary across species of hummingbirds.[79]\\r\\nMale rufous and broad-tailed hummingbirds (genus Selasphorus) have a distinctive wing feature during normal flight that sounds like jingling or a buzzing shrill whistle.[84] The trill arises from air rushing through slots created by the tapered tips of the ninth and tenth primary wing feathers, creating a sound loud enough to be detected by female or competitive male hummingbirds and researchers up to 100?m away.[84]\\r\\nBehaviorally, the trill serves several purposes:[84]\\r\\nHummingbirds are restricted to the Americas from south central Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, including the Caribbean. The majority of species occur in tropical and subtropical Central and South America, but several species also breed in temperate climates and some hillstars occur even in alpine Andean highlands at altitudes up to 5,200 metres (17,100?ft).[85]\\r\\nThe greatest species richness is in humid tropical and subtropical forests of the northern Andes and adjacent foothills, but the number of species found in the Atlantic Forest, Central America or southern Mexico also far exceeds the number found in southern South America, the Caribbean islands, the United States, and Canada. While fewer than 25 different species of hummingbirds have been recorded from the United States and fewer than 10 from Canada and Chile each,[86] Colombia alone has more than 160[87] and the comparably small Ecuador has about 130 species.[88]\\r\\nThe migratory ruby-throated hummingbird breeds in a range from the southeastern United States to Ontario,[89] while the black-chinned hummingbird, its close relative and another migrant, is the most widespread and common species in the southwestern United States. The rufous hummingbird is the most widespread species in western North America,[90] and the only hummingbird to be recorded outside of the Americas, having occurred in the Chukchi Peninsula of Russia.[91]\\r\\nMost North American hummingbirds migrate southward in fall to spend winter in Mexico, the Caribbean Islands, or Central America. A few southern South American species also move north to the tropics during the southern winter. A few species are year-round residents of California and southwestern desert regions of the USA. Among these are Anna's hummingbird, a common resident from southern Arizona and inland California, and buff-bellied hummingbird, an uncommon resident in subtropical woodlands of southern Texas east through the Gulf coast to the Atlantic coast of Florida. Ruby-throated hummingbirds migrate from as far north as Ontario, Canada, in summer, returning to Mexico, South America, southern Texas, and Florida to winter.[92]\\r\\nThe rufous hummingbird breeds farther north than any other species of hummingbird, often breeding in large numbers in temperate western North America and wintering in increasing numbers along the coasts of subtropical Gulf of Mexico and Florida, rather than in western or central Mexico.[93] By migrating in spring as far north as the Yukon or southern Alaska,[93] the rufous hummingbird migrates more extensively and nests farther north than any other hummingbird species, and must tolerate occasional temperatures below freezing in its breeding territory. This cold hardiness enables it to survive temperatures below freezing, provided that adequate shelter and food are available.[93]\\r\\nAs calculated by displacement of body size, the rufous hummingbird makes perhaps the longest migratory journey of any bird in the world. At just over 3 in long, rufous birds travel 3,900-miles one-way from Alaska to Mexico in late summer, a distance equal to 78,470,000 body lengths.[93] By comparison, the 13-inch-long Arctic tern makes a one-way flight of about 11,185 miles, or 51,430,000 body lengths, just 65% of the body displacement during migration by rufous hummingbirds.[93]\\r\\nThe northward migration of rufous hummingbirds occurs along the Pacific flyway[93] and may be time-coordinated with flower and tree leaf emergence in spring in early March, and also with availability of insects as food.[94] Arrival at breeding grounds before nectar availability from mature flowers may jeopardize breeding opportunities, a factor of phenology possibly determining future migratory patterns linked to climate change.[95]\\r\\nFor nutrition, hummingbirds eat a variety of insects, including mosquitoes, fruit flies, and gnats in flight or aphids on leaves and spiders in their webs.[96][97][98][99] The lower beak of hummingbirds is flexible and can bend as much as 25 degrees when it widens at the base, making a larger surface for catching insects.[98] Hummingbirds hover within insect swarms in a method called \\"hover-hawking\\" to facilitate feeding.[99]\\r\\nTo supply energy needs, hummingbirds drink nectar, a sweet liquid inside certain flowers. Like bees, they are able to assess the amount of sugar in the nectar they eat; they normally reject flower types that produce nectar that is less than 10% sugar and prefer those whose sugar content is higher. Nectar is a mixture of glucose, fructose, and sucrose, and is a poor source of nutrients, requiring hummingbirds to meet their nutritional needs by consuming insects.[98][99]\\r\\nHummingbirds do not spend all day flying, as the energy cost would be prohibitive; the majority of their activity consists simply of sitting or perching. Hummingbirds eat many small meals and consume around half their weight in nectar (twice their weight in nectar, if the nectar is 25% sugar) each day.[100] Hummingbirds digest their food rapidly due to their small size and high metabolism; a mean retention time less than an hour has been reported.[101] Hummingbirds spend an average of 10ÿ15% of their time feeding and 75ÿ80% sitting and digesting.\\r\\nBecause their high metabolism makes them vulnerable to starvation, hummingbirds are highly attuned to food sources. Some species, including many found in North America, are territorial and will try to guard food sources (such as a feeder) against other hummingbirds, attempting to ensure a future food supply for itself. Additionally, hummingbirds have an enlarged hippocampus, a brain region facilitating spatial memory used to map flowers previously visited during nectar foraging.[102]\\r\\nHummingbird beaks are flexible[98] and their shapes vary dramatically as an adaptation for specialized feeding.[15][16] Some species, such as hermits (Phaethornis spp.) have long bills that allow them to probe deep into flowers with long corollae. Thornbills have short, sharp bills adapted for feeding from flowers with short corollae and piercing the bases of longer ones. The sicklebills' extremely decurved bills are adapted to extracting nectar from the curved corollae of flowers in the family Gesneriaceae. The bill of the fiery-tailed awlbill has an upturned tip, as in the avocets. The male tooth-billed hummingbird has barracuda-like spikes at the tip of its long, straight bill.\\r\\nThe two halves of a hummingbird's bill have a pronounced overlap, with the lower half (mandible) fitting tightly inside the upper half (maxilla). When a hummingbird feeds on nectar, the bill is usually opened only slightly, allowing the tongue to dart out and into the interior of flowers. Hummingbird bill sizes range from about 5?mm to as long as 100?mm (about 4 in).[103] When catching insects in flight, a hummingbird's jaw flexes downward to widen the gape for successful capture.[97]\\r\\nPerception of sweetness in nectar evolved in hummingbirds during their genetic divergence from insectivorous swifts, their closest bird relatives.[104] Although the only known sweet sensory receptor, called T1R2,[105] is absent in birds, receptor expression studies showed that hummingbirds adapted a carbohydrate receptor from the T1R1-T1R3 receptor, identical to the one perceived as umami in humans, essentially repurposing it to function as a nectar sweetness receptor.[104] This adaptation for taste enabled hummingbirds to detect and exploit sweet nectar as an energy source, facilitating their distribution across geographical regions where nectar-bearing flowers are available.[104]\\r\\nHummingbirds drink with their tongues by rapidly lapping nectar. Their tongues have tubes which run down their lengths and help the hummingbirds drink the nectar.[106] While capillary action was believed to be what drew nectar into these tubes, high-speed photography has revealed that the tubes open down their sides as the tongue goes into the nectar, and then close around the nectar, trapping it so it can be pulled back into the beak.[107][108] The tongue, which is forked, is compressed until it reaches nectar, then the tongue springs open, the rapid action traps the nectar and the nectar moves up the grooves, like a pump action, with capillary action not involved.[106][109] Consequently, tongue flexibility enables accessing, transporting and unloading nectar.[110][111]\\r\\nIn the wild, hummingbirds visit flowers for food, extracting nectar, which is 55% sucrose, 24% glucose and 21% fructose on a dry-matter basis.[112] Hummingbirds also take sugar-water from bird feeders. Such feeders allow people to observe and enjoy hummingbirds up close while providing the birds with a reliable source of energy, especially when flower blossoms are less abundant. A negative aspect of artificial feeders, however, is that the birds may seek less flower nectar for food, so reduce the amount of pollination their feeding naturally provides.[113]\\r\\nWhite granulated sugar is the best sweetener to use in hummingbird feeders. A ratio of 1 part sugar to 4 parts water, or 25% concentration, is a common recipe,[114] although hummingbirds will defend feeders more aggressively when sugar content is at 35%, indicating preference for nectar with higher sweetness and sugar content.[115] Organic and \\"raw\\" sugars contain iron, which can be harmful,[116] and brown sugar agave syrup, molasses and artificial sweeteners also should not be used.[117] Honey is made by bees from the nectar of flowers, but it is not good to use in feeders because when it is diluted with water, microorganisms easily grow in it, causing it to spoil rapidly.[118][119][120]\\r\\nRed food dye was once thought to be a favorable ingredient for homemade solutions, but it is unnecessary, and there is no point in adding it to the nectar. Some people speculate red dye could be bad for the birds, although this claim has not received scientific attention.[121] Commercial products sold as \\"instant nectar\\" or \\"hummingbird food\\" may also contain preservatives and/or artificial flavors as well as dyes, and are not necessary,[121] although the long-term effects of these additives on hummingbirds have not been systematically studied.[122] Although some commercial products contain small amounts of nutritional additives, hummingbirds obtain all necessary nutrients from the insects they eat, rendering added nutrients unnecessary.[90]\\r\\nOther animals also visit hummingbird feeders. Bees, wasps, and ants are attracted to the sugar-water and may crawl into the feeder, where they may become trapped and drown. Orioles, woodpeckers, bananaquits, raccoons and other larger animals are known to drink from hummingbird feeders, sometimes tipping them and draining the liquid.[123] In the southwestern United States, two species of nectar-drinking bats (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae and Choeronycteris mexicana) visit hummingbird feeders to supplement their natural diet of nectar and pollen from saguaro cacti and agaves.[124]\\r\\nHummingbirds have exceptional visual acuity providing them with discrimination of food sources while foraging.[28] Although it is commonly believed that hummingbirds are attracted to color while seeking food, such as red flowers or artificial feeders, experiments indicate that location and flower nectar quality are the most important \\"beacons\\" for foraging.[125][126] Hummingbirds depended little on visual cues of flower color to beacon to nectar-rich locations, but rather they used surrounding landmarks to find the nectar reward.[127][128]\\r\\nIn at least one hummingbird species ÿ the green-backed firecrown (Sephanoides sephaniodes) ÿ flower colors preferred are in the red-green wavelength for the bird's visual system, providing a higher contrast than for other flower colors.[129] Further, the crown plumage of firecrown males is highly iridescent in the red wavelength range (peak at 650 nanometers), possibly providing a competitive advantage of dominance when foraging among other hummingbird species with less-colorful plumage.[129] The ability to discriminate colors of flowers and plumage is enabled by a visual system having four single cone cells and a double cone screened by photoreceptor oil droplets which enhance color discrimination.[125][129]\\r\\nSome species of sunbirds of Africa, southern and southeastern Asia, and Australia resemble hummingbirds in appearance and behavior, as do perhaps also the honeyeaters of Australia and Pacific islands. These two groups, however, are not related to hummingbirds, as their resemblance is due to convergent evolution.[130]\\r\\nThe hummingbird moth is often mistaken for a hummingbird.\\r\\n\\r\\nHummingbirds feeding at 1500fps\\r\\nHummingbird feeding from a flower in the University of California Botanical Garden\\r\\nHummingbird with yellow pollen on its beak in the University of California Botanical Garden\\r\\nTalamanca hummingbird\\r\\nCosta's hummingbird\\r\\nJuvenile Anna's hummingbird with tongue sticking out\\r\\nCalypte anna perched\\r\\nArtificial hummingbird\\r\\nHummingbird chicks in nest in cactus in Mesa, Arizona\\r\\nHummingbird adult in nest in cactus in Mesa, Arizona\\r\\nA female Anna's Hummingbird perched on a small branch.","input":"How many times does a hummingbird heartbeat per minute?"},{"output":"April 1, 2002","context":"Governors Island is a 172-acre (70?ha) island in New York Harbor, approximately 800 yards (732?m) from the southern tip of Manhattan Island and separated from Brooklyn by Buttermilk Channel, approximately 400 yards (366?m). It is part of the borough of Manhattan in New York City. The National Park Service administers a small portion of the north of the island as the Governors Island National Monument, while the Trust for Governors Island operates the remaining 150 acres, including 52 historic buildings. Today, Governors Island is a popular seasonal destination open to the public between May and September with a 43-acre public park completed between 2012 and 2016, free arts and cultural events, and recreational activities. The island is accessed by ferries from Brooklyn and Manhattan.\\r\\nThe Lenape of the Manhattan region referred to the island as Paggank (\\"nut island\\"), likely after the island's plentiful hickory, oak, and chestnut trees;[3] the Dutch explorer Adriaen Block called it Noten Eylant, a translation, and this was borrowed into English as Nutten Island. The island's current name, made official in 1784, stems from the British colonial era, when the colonial assembly reserved the island for the exclusive use of New York's royal governors.\\r\\nIn 1776, during the American Revolutionary War (1775ÿ1783), Continental Army troops raised defensive works on the island, which they used to fire upon British ships before they were taken. From 1783 to 1966, the island was a United States Army post, and later from 1966 to 1996, the island served as a major United States Coast Guard installation. About 103 acres (42?ha) of fill was added to the island by 1912, making the island a 172-acre (70?ha) island.[4]\\r\\nIn 1524, Giovanni da Verrazzano saw the then called Paggank island, becoming the first European in record to do so. (Island of Nuts;[3] described above) by the Native Americans.[5]\\r\\nIn May 1624, Noten Eylandt (\\"Island of Nuts\\"; officially renamed Governors Island in 1784) was the landing place of the first settlers in New Netherland. They had arrived from the Dutch Republic with the ship New Netherland under the command of Cornelius Jacobsen May, who disembarked on the island with thirty families in order to take possession of the New Netherland territory.[6] As such, the New York State Senate and Assembly recognize Governors Island as the birthplace of the state of New York, and also certify the island as the place on which the planting of the \\"legal-political guaranty of tolerance onto the North American continent\\" took place.[7]\\r\\nIn 1633, the fifth director of New Netherland, Wouter van Twiller, arrived with a 104-man regiment on Governors Islandits first use as a military base. Later he operated a farm on the island. He secured his farm by drawing up a deed on June 16, 1637, which was signed by two Lenape, Cacapeteyno and Pewihas, on behalf of their community at Keshaechquereren, situated in what today is New Jersey.\\r\\nNew Netherland was conditionally ceded to the English in 1664, and the English renamed the settlement New York in June 1665.[8] By 1674, the British had total control of the island.[9]\\r\\nAfter the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, in one night, April 9, 1776, Continental Army General Israel Putnam fortified the island with earthworks and 40 cannons in anticipation of the return of the British Army and navy who had quit New York City the year before. The harbor defenses on the island continued to be improved over the summer, and on July 12, 1776, engaged HMS Phoenix and HMS Rose as they made a run up the Hudson River to the Tappan Zee. The colonists' cannon inflicted enough damage to make the British commanders cautious of entering the East River, which later contributed to the success of General George Washington's retreat across it from Brooklyn into Manhattan after the Battle of Long Island (also known as the Battle of Brooklyn), the British Army effort to take Brooklyn Heights overlooking Manhattan and the largest battle of the entire war.[9]\\r\\nThe Continental Army forces collapsed after being flanked and eventually withdrew from Brooklyn and from Governors Island as well, and the British occupied it in late August. From September 2 to 14, the new British garrison would engage volleys with Washington's guns on the battery in front of Fort George in Manhattan.[10] The fort, along with the rest of New York City, was held by the British for the rest of the war until Evacuation Day at the end of the war in 1783.\\r\\nAt the end of the Revolution, the island, as a former holding of the Crown, came into ownership by the state of New York and saw no military usage. Prompted by the unsettled international situation between the warring powers of France and Great Britain and the need for more substantial harbor fortifications, the Revolutionary War-era earthworks were rehabilitated into harbor defenses by the city and state of New York.\\r\\nNoten (in pidgin language, \\"Nutten\\") Island was renamed Governors Island in 1784 as the island, in earlier times, had been reserved by the British colonial assembly for the exclusive use of New York's royal governors. The Governor's House (perhaps ca 1703, with additions) survives as the oldest structure on the island.[11]\\r\\nBy the late 1790s, the Quasi-War with France prompted a national program of harbor fortifications and the state of New York began improvements as a credit for its Revolutionary War debt. In February 1800, the island was conveyed to the federal government, which undertook the reconstruction of Fort Jay and new construction of two waterfront batteries, Castle Williams and South or Half Moon Battery.[9]\\r\\nTwo forts were built. The first, Fort Jay, was built in 1794 by the state of New York on the site of the earlier Revolutionary War earthworks, and was originally a square four-bastioned fort of earthworks and timber. A sandstone and brick gate house topped with a sculpture of an eagle dates to that time and is the oldest structure on the island. From 1806 to 1809, Fort Jay, then renamed Fort Columbus was reconstructed in more substantial brick and granite with the addition of a ravelin on its north face, giving the fort its current five-point-star appearance, to better protect the fort from a Manhattan-based attack and to more directly place cannon fire on to the East and Hudson Rivers.[9] The second major fortification, Castle Williams, was based on a design by Colonel Jonathan Williams; construction started in 1807 and substantially completed in November 1811. Located on a rocky shoal extending from the northwest corner of the island, it was inspired by then-modern French thinking on fortifications, but a pioneering design for American fortification. It was a designed as a circular structure that could project a 320 degree arc of cannon fire from three levels of casemates (bomb-proof rooms holding two cannons each) and roof, holding 103 cannon gun emplacements.[9]\\r\\nFort Jay and Castle Williams are considered among the best remaining examples of First System (Fort Jay) and Second System (Castle Williams) American coastal fortification. They proved useful soon after completion, as they were used to defend the city in the War of 1812.[9] However, within two decades, their defenses were antiquated and the forts' usages needed to be downsized. Therefore, part of Governors Island was repurposed for civilian use. However, the Army still retained military operations, with an \\"administrative and training center\\" on the island and a muster station throughout the MexicanÿAmerican War and American Civil War; in addition, there was an arsenal and Army-operated music school located on the island.[9]\\r\\nDuring the American Civil War, Castle Williams held Confederate prisoners of war and Fort Jay held captured Confederate officers. After the war, Castle Williams was used as a military stockade and became the east coast counterpart to military prisons at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and Alcatraz Island, California.[9] In 1878, the military installation on the island, then known collectively as Fort Columbus, became a major Army administrative center. Army officers' families started to move in, and resources, such as a movie theater, a YMCA, an \\"officer's club,\\" a public school, and three chapels, were built.[9] In 1885, the first incinerator in the U.S. was built on Governors Island.[12]\\r\\nUsing material excavated from the first New York City subway line (the IRT Lexington Avenue Line under Lexington Avenue), the Army Corps of Engineers supervised the deposit of 4,787,000 cubic yards (3,660,000?m3) of fill on the south side of Governors Island, adding 103 acres (42?ha) of flat, treeless land by 1912 and bringing the total acreage of the island to 172.[4][not in citation given]\\r\\nBy 1912, the island's administrative leaders included General Tasker H. Bliss, who would become Army Chief of Staff in 1917.[13] In 1939, the island became the headquarters of the U.S. First Army.[9] Throughout this period, the army culture on the island grew.[9]\\r\\nThe BrooklynÿBattery Tunnel passes underwater and off-shore of the island's northeast corner, its location marked by a ventilation building connected to the island by a causeway. At one point prior to World War II, Robert Moses proposed a bridge across the harbor, with a base located on Governors Island. The intervention of the War Department quashed the plan, calling it a possible navigational threat to the Brooklyn Navy Yard.\\r\\nPrior to the construction of Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, the island was considered as a site for a municipal airport, and it held a small grass strip, the Governors Island Army Airfield, from the 1950s until the 1960s.[14]\\r\\nAfter a yearlong study of by the Department of Defense to cut costs and reduce the number of military installations, the Army announced in November 1964 that Fort Jay and Brooklyn Navy Yard were to be closed by 1966.[9]\\r\\nWhen the Army left Governors Island in 1966, the installation became a United States Coast Guard base.[9] The Coast Guard saw the island as an opportunity to consolidate and provide more facilities for its schools, and as a base for its regional and Atlantic Ocean operations. This was the Coast Guard's largest installation, and for them as the Army, served both as a self-contained residential community, with an on-island population of approximately 3,500, and as a base of operations for the Atlantic Area Command, its regional Third District command, Maintenance and Logistics Command, various schools which were relocated from Coast Guard Station New London in New London, Connecticut, and the local office of the Captain of the Port of New York.\\r\\nIt was also homeport for several U.S. Coast Guard cutters including USCGC Dallas (WHEC-716), USCGC Gallatin (WHEC-721), USCGC Morgenthau (WHEC-722), USCGC Tamaroa (WMEC-166) and USCGC Sorrel (WLB-296).\\r\\nIn the thirty years of occupation on the island, the Coast Guard began a long, slow process of upgrading facilities and infrastructure that had been little improved upon since the 1930s. This effort also prompted a recognition of the island's military heritage by having 92 acres (370,000?m2) recognized as a National Historic Landmark on February 4, 1985, recognizing its wide range and representation of Army fortification, administrative and residential architecture dating from the early days of the nation.[2][15][16]\\r\\nDuring this time, Governors Island has served as the backdrop for a number of historic events. In 1986, the island was the setting for the relighting of the newly refurbished Statue of Liberty by President Ronald Reagan. On December 8, 1988, along with Vice President and President elect George Bush, President Ronald Reagan held his final meeting as president with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in the Commanding Officer's quarters. In July 1993, the United Nations sponsored talks at the South Battery Officer's Club to help restore democratic rule in Haiti resulting in the Governors Island Accord, signed between Haitian political leaders.[17]\\r\\nLike the Army 30 years before, the U.S. Department of Transportation, then parent of the Coast Guard, was compelled to cut costs as other federal agencies in the early 1990s. Because of its high operating costs and remote location from most of its activity in Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, the Governors Island base was identified for closure in 1995. The closure was an agency initiative and not part of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) process that impacted numerous Department of Defense installations at that time.\\r\\nBy September 1996 the Coast Guard had relocated all functions and residential personnel to offices and bases in Rhode Island and Virginia. The Coast Guard left a caretaker detachment to maintain the island along with the General Services Administration (GSA) while its future was determined. With the departure of the Coast Guard, almost two centuries of the island's use as a federal military reservation concluded. The disposal of the island as excess federal property was outlined in the Budget Reduction Act of 1996. The legislation set a deadline and directed that the island be sold at a fair market value by GSA by 2002, but gave the city and state of New York a right of first refusal, a provision that was inserted into the legislation by New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan who envisioned the island with great potential as a public and civic resource.\\r\\nWith the announcement of the Coast Guard base closure and departure, city and state officials along with private developers and civic planners began to offer opinions and ideas on the island's future that included housing, parks, education and private development.\\r\\nIn 1996, Van Alen Institute hosted an ideas competition called \\"Public Property\\" which asked designers \\"to consider the urban potential of Governors Island in terms of spatial adjacencies and experiential overlaps between a range of actions, actors, events, and ecologies... to acknowledge the physical reality of cities and their historic programmatic complexity as fundamental to the survival of a vital public realm.\\" The competition was open to anyone who registered. More than 200 entries from students, faculty, and landscape architects in 14 different countries were received. The jury members included: Andrea Kahn, Christine Boyer, Miriam Gusevich, Judith Henitz, Carlos Jimenez, and Enric Miralles.\\r\\nA proposal to adaptively reuse Castle Williams for a New Globe Theater was designed by architect Norman Foster.[18] The non-profit organization worked in partnership with Shakespeare's Globe Theater in London to develop a proposal and seek backing for a cultural center and performance space in the Castle. With the completion of a National Park Service general management plan for Castle Williams and Fort Jay in 2009, it was determined that the proposed use of the Castle for the theater was not congruous with its historical significance.\\r\\nIn a last-minute act while in office, President Bill Clinton designated 22 acres of the island, including the two great forts, as Governors Island National Monument on January 19, 2001. In the next year on April 1, 2002, President George W. Bush, Governor Pataki, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that the federal government would sell Governors Island to the people of New York for a nominal cost, and that the island would be used for public benefit. At the time of the transfer, deed restrictions were created that prohibit permanent housing and casinos on the island. On January 31, 2003, 150 acres of Governors Island were transferred to the people of New York, to be administered by a joint city-state agency, the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation (GIPEC). The remaining 22 acres was legally reaffirmed by presidential proclamation on February 7, 2003 as the Governors Island National Monument, to be administered by the National Park Service.\\r\\nOn January 19, 2001, Fort Jay and Castle Williams, two of the island's three historical fortifications, were proclaimed a National Monument. On January 31, 2003, 150 acres (61?ha) of the island was transferred to the State and City of New York for $1. The remainder, a 22 acres (9?ha) portion, was transferred to the United States Department of the Interior as the Governors Island National Monument, administered by the National Park Service. The 150-acre portion of the island not included in the National Monument is administered by The Trust for Governors Island, an entity of the City of New York and the successor of the joint city/state established redevelopment entity, the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation. The transfer included deed restrictions which prohibit permanent housing or casinos on the island.\\r\\nOn February 15, 2006, Governor George Pataki and Mayor Michael Bloomberg called for \\"visionary ideas to redevelop and preserve Governors Island\\"[19] to be submitted to Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation (GIPEC). The announcement said proposals should \\"enhance New York's place as a center of culture, business, education and innovation,\\" include public parkland, contribute to the harbor's vitality and stress \\"environmentally sustainable development.\\" Deputy Mayor Dan Doctoroff said whatever group or entity is selected to develop the island would assume the $12 million annual maintenance costs that are now split between the city and state. In early 2007, GIPEC paused in the search for developers, focusing on the development of a major park on the island as called for in the deed that conveyed the island from the federal government to the city and state of New York.\\r\\nIn 2007, the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation announced five finalist design teams that were chosen to submit their ideas for the future park and Great Promenade;[20][21] the GIPEC had awarded leases to its first two tenants a year before.[21] The corporation appointed West 8, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Rogers Marvel Architects, Quennell Rothschild & Partners, and SMWM to design a development plan for Governors Island.[22][23] The plan included 87 acres (35?ha) of open space on the island, as well as provided for the restoration of the historic district and a new park on the southern half of the island.[20] Each firm was asked their visions for the new park. Dutch landscape architecture firm West 8's proposal featured dramatic topography \\"in concert with winding pathways and trees to create 'conceal and reveal' vistas, choreographing the park experience.\\"[24] The firm also proposed free bicycle rentals around the island;[20][22][25] and, since the island is windy, designed their proposed topography to provide moments of shelter.[22] With transportation to and from the island, one idea considered was an aerial gondola system designed by Santiago Calatrava.[22][26]\\r\\nThere are very few tenants on the island. Fewer than 1,000 workers, artists, and students work or live on the island.[27] However, in 2009, a 3-acre (12,000?m2) commercial organic farm, operated by the non-profit organization, Added Value, was launched.[28] In 2010, the Urban Assembly New York Harbor School, a small public high school in Bushwick, Brooklyn, was relocated to the Island, remodeling the former Coast Guard clinic in Building 555. Also that year, artist studios run by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and housed in a portion of Building 110 opened, and New York University announced an expansion plan that included a campus on the Island, \\"complete with dorms and faculty housing.\\"[29]\\r\\nIn April 2010, the city entered an agreement to take full control of the island's development from the state of New York through a newly established Trust for Governors Island, and unveiled a new master development plan. Under the plan, the historic northern end will remain structurally unchanged. The middle of the island would be developed into a park stretching to the southern tip. Areas on the east and west sides of the island will be privately developed to generate revenue, and the entire island will be edged by a circumferential promenade. The 40-acre (160,000?m2) park, designed by Adriaan Geuze of the Dutch landscape architecture firm West 8 would feature playing fields, woodland, and hills built of the rubble of the disused 20th-century buildings sculpted to frame views of the Statue of Liberty and other New York landmarks. The southern end of the park would meet the water in a series of wetlands.[30]\\r\\nIn November 2011, the Center for Urban Real Estate (CURE) at Columbia University proposed a fanciful idea of using fill to physically connect Manhattan to Governors Island. CURE proposed \\"a 92-acre national historic district on the island, 3.9 million square feet for public buildings like schools and 270 acres of open space\\" in their plan. This proposal, called LoLo, would require 23 million cubic yards of landfill and allow for up to 88 million square feet of new development, while providing new subway stations from the extension of the 1 and 6 trains. and a bridge to Red Hook, Brooklyn. The proposed landfill bridge would also serve as a storm surge barrier.[31]\\r\\nOn May 24, 2012, Mayor Michael Bloomberg broke ground on the new park and public spaces designed by landscape architecture firm West 8, along with announcing the opening of the rehabilitated Castle Williams.[32]\\r\\nThe Bloomberg administration's ten-year capital plan had provided funding for the first phase of construction, which began in the summer of 2012.[33] As part of phase 1 of the master plan:[33]\\r\\nOn June 6, 2015, the Oyster Pavilion was set to open.[35] The 10-acre (4.0?ha) Hills section of the park was the last piece of the newly redeveloped island to open.[36] The Hills opened on July 21, 2016,[37] and consist of four hills that are 26 to 70 feet (7.9 to 21.3?m) high,[38] including a hill that contains four long slides.[39]\\r\\nSince the decision by the US Coast Guard to vacate the 172-acre (0.70?km2) island in 1995, the Governors Island Alliance and its 50 member organizations led a campaign to return the island to New York for public purposes.[40] Since 2014 the Alliance has been an independent non-profit. In 2016 it was renamed Friends of Governors Island. The Friends run volunteer and membership programs, raise money and perform advocacy for the island.\\r\\nFrom its transfer in 2003 to 2015, Governors Island was open to the public on weekends during the summer. Now the island can be visited seven days a week from May 1 through October 31.\\r\\nStarting in 2010, weekend ferry service commenced between Governors Island and Brooklyn Bridge Park's Pier 6 at Atlantic Avenue. On the island, passengers depart and arrive at Yankee Pier.[41] A summer Friday-only loop serves Governors Island, Manhattan, Atlantic Avenue, and Brooklyn Bridge Park.\\r\\nIn June 2011, NY Waterway started service to points along the East River.[42] On May 1, 2017, that route became part of the NYC Ferry's East River route, which runs between Pier 11/Wall Street in Manhattan's Financial District and the East 34th Street Ferry Landing in Murray Hill, Manhattan, with five intermediate stops in Brooklyn and Queens.[43][44] During summer weekends, Governors Island is an intermediate stop on the route between Pier 11 and Fulton Ferry.[45]\\r\\nAccess from Manhattan is from the Battery Maritime Building in the Financial District. The 1908 cast-iron structure, located next to the Staten Island Ferry terminal, was restored between 2001-2006.[46] Service is half-hourly. The departure and arrival dock on Governors Island is the Soissons Dock at the north tip of the island. The ride is about 7 minutes in duration. This ferry is only accessible during the late spring and the summer.[47]\\r\\nActivities on the island include free National Park Service walking tours, bike riding, picnicking, art installations, fairs, drone races, festivals, and concerts. Bicycle, tandem, and quadcycle rental is provided on the island by Bike and Roll at hourly and daily rates.[48] New York Water Taxi operates an artificial beach on the northern tip of the island.[49] The island is roughly divided in half by a street called Division Road. The northeastern half is currently open to the public. The southwestern half, which contains the abandoned U.S. Coast Guard housing and service areas, is still in redevelopment and some sections remain closed to the public. However, three sections of the park are open: the southern end Picnic Point, the central Hammock Grove as of 2014, and The Hills on the southwestern corner as of 2016. The island's circumferential drive along the waterfront is also open to the public. Demolition of the U.S. Coast Guard housing began in 2008. It is on the grounds of the former Liberty Village housing area that was used by Coast Guard families between 1988 and 1996.[50] There are still Coast Guard buildings and barracks, not of historical significance, in areas yet to be redeveloped.\\r\\nThe Governors Island Art Fair has taken place annually on the island during weekends in September since 2007. Originally located in buildings on Colonel's Row, the event has grown to include Castle Williams and Fort Jay as artist venues. The 2015 season saw an expansion in the number and variety of exhibits, held in the former officers' quarters and other buildings, some redeveloped, some not.\\r\\nThe \\"World Trade Center Run to Remember\\" has been run annually on the island since 2009 on the first Sunday of September. The activities include a 5K Run, 3K Family Fun Run/Walk, Children's Fun Run, and other activities to benefit organizations associated with 9/11 related services.[51]\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nSources\\r\\nFurther reading\\r\\nOfficial websites:\\r\\nOther websites:","input":"When did governors island open to the public?"},{"output":"France","context":"The idea of the Panama canal dates back to the 1513 discovery of the isthmus by Vasco N~?ez de Balboa. The narrow land bridge between North and South America houses the Panama Canal, a water passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The earliest European colonists recognized this potential, and several proposals for a canal were made.[1]\\r\\nBy the late nineteenth century, technological advances and commercial pressure allowed construction to begin in earnest. Noted canal engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps led an initial attempt by France to build a sea-level canal. Beset by cost overruns due to the severe underestimation of the difficulties in excavating the rugged Panama land, heavy personnel losses in Panama due to tropical diseases, and political corruption in France surrounding the financing of the massive project, the project succeeded in only partially completing the canal.\\r\\nInterest in a U.S.-led canal effort picked up as soon as France abandoned the project. Initially, the Panama site was politically unfavorable in the U.S. for a variety of reasons, including the taint of the failed French efforts and the Colombian government's unfriendly attitude towards the U.S. continuing the project. The U.S. first sought to construct a completely new canal through Nicaragua instead.\\r\\nFrench engineer and financier Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla played a key role in changing U.S. attitudes. Bunau-Varilla had a large stake in the failed French canal company, and stood to make money on his investment only if the Panama Canal was completed. Extensive lobbying of U.S. lawmakers coupled with his support of a nascent independence movement among the Panamanian people led to a simultaneous revolution in Panama and the negotiation of the HayÿBunau-Varilla Treaty which secured both independence for Panama and the right for the U.S. to lead a renewed effort to construct the canal. Colombia's response to the Panamanian independence movement was tempered by U.S. military presence; the move is often cited as a classic example of the era of gunboat diplomacy.\\r\\nU.S. success hinged on two factors. First was converting the original French sea-level plan to a more realistic lock-controlled canal. The second was controlling disease which decimated workers and management alike under the original French attempt. Initial chief engineer John Frank Stevens built much of the infrastructure necessary for later construction; slow progress on the canal itself led to his replacement by George Washington Goethals. Goethals oversaw the bulk of the excavation of the canal, including appointing Major David du Bose Gaillard to oversee the most daunting project, the Culebra Cut through the roughest terrain on the route. Almost as important as the engineering advances was the healthcare advances made during the construction, led by William C. Gorgas, an expert in controlling tropical diseases such as yellow fever and malaria. Gorgas was one of the first to recognize the role of mosquitoes in the spread of these diseases, and by focusing on controlling the mosquitoes greatly improved worker conditions.\\r\\nOn 7 January 1914 the French crane boat Alexandre La Valley became the first to make the traverse, and on 1 April 1914 the construction was officially completed with the hand-over of the project from the construction company to the Canal Zone government. The outbreak of World War I caused the cancellation of any official \\"grand opening\\" celebration, and the canal officially opened to commercial traffic on 15 August 1914 with the transit of the SS Ancon.\\r\\nDuring World War II, the canal proved a vital part of the U.S. military strategy, allowing ships to transfer easily between the Atlantic and Pacific. Politically, the Canal remained a territory of the United States until 1977, when the TorrijosÿCarter Treaties began the process of transferring territorial control of the Panama Canal Zone to Panama, a process completed on 31 December 1999.\\r\\nThe Panama Canal continues to be a viable commercial venture and a vital link in world shipping, and continues to be periodically updated and maintained. The Panama Canal expansion project started construction in 2007 and began commercial operation on 26 June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger Post-Panamax and New Panamax ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the original locks could accommodate.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of a canal across Central America was revived during the early 19th century. In 1819, the Spanish government authorized the construction of a canal and the creation of a company to build it.\\r\\nAlthough the project stalled for some time, a number of surveys were made between 1850 and 1875. They indicated that the two most-favorable routes were across Panama (then part of Colombia) and Nicaragua, with a third route across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico another option. The Nicaraguan route was surveyed.\\r\\nAfter the 1869 completion of the Suez Canal, France thought that an apparently-similar project to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans could be carried out with little difficulty. In 1876 an international company, La Socit internationale du Canal interocanique, was created to undertake its construction; two years later, it obtained a concession from the Colombian government (since Panama was a Colombian province) to dig a canal across the isthmus.\\r\\nFerdinand de Lesseps, who was in charge of the Suez Canal construction, headed the project. His enthusiastic leadership and his reputation as the man who had built the Suez Canal persuaded speculators and ordinary citizens to invest nearly $400?million in the project.\\r\\nHowever, despite his previous success de Lesseps was not an engineer. The Suez Canal, essentially a ditch dug through a flat, sandy desert, presented few challenges. Although Central America's mountainous spine has a low point in Panama, it is still 110 meters (360.9?ft) above sea level at its lowest crossing point. The sea-level canal proposed by de Lesseps would require a great deal of excavation through a variety of rock, rather than Suez' sand.\\r\\nLess-obvious barriers were the rivers crossing the canal, particularly the Chagres (which flows strongly during the rainy season). Since the water would be a hazard to shipping if it drained into the canal, a sea-level canal would require the river's diversion.\\r\\nThe most serious problem was tropical disease, particularly malaria and yellow fever, whose methods of transmission were unknown at the time. The legs of hospital beds were placed in cans of water to keep insects from crawling up them, but the stagnant water was an ideal breeding place for mosquitoes (carriers of the diseases).\\r\\nThe project was plagued by a lack of engineering expertise. In May 1879, an international engineering congress led by de Lesseps convened in Paris. Of its 136 delegates, only 42 were engineers; the others were speculators, politicians and friends of de Lesseps.\\r\\nHe was convinced that a sea-level canal, dug through the mountainous spine of Central America, could be completed at least as easily as the Suez Canal. The engineering congress estimated the project's cost at $214 million; on February 14, 1880, an engineering commission revised the estimate to $168.6 million. De Lesseps reduced this estimate twice, with no apparent justification: on February 20 to $131.6 million and on March 1 to $120 million. The congress estimated seven or eight years as the time required to complete the canal; de Lesseps reduced this estimate to six years (the Suez Canal required ten).\\r\\nThe proposed sea-level canal would have a uniform depth of 9 meters (29.5?ft), a bottom width of 22 meters (72.2?ft) and a width at water level of about 27.5 meters (90.2?ft); the excavation estimate was 120,000,000?m3 (157,000,000?cu?yd). A dam was proposed at Gamboa to control flooding of the Chagres River, with channels to drain water away from the canal. However, the Gamboa dam was later found impracticable and the Chagres River problem was left unsolved.\\r\\nConstruction of the canal began on January 1, 1881, with digging at Culebra beginning on January 22.[1] A large labor force was assembled, numbering about 40,000 in 1888 (nine-tenths of whom were afro-Caribbean workers from the West Indies). Although the project attracted good, well-paid French engineers, retaining them was difficult due to disease. The death toll from 1881 to 1889 was estimated at over 22,000, of whom as many as 5,000 were French citizens.[3]\\r\\nBy 1885 it had become clear to many that a sea-level canal was impractical, and an elevated canal with locks was preferable; de Lesseps resisted, and a lock canal plan was not adopted until October 1887. By this time increasing mortality rates, as well as financial and engineering problems coupled with frequent floods and mudslides, indicated that the project was in serious trouble. Work continued under the new plan until May 15, 1889, when the company went bankrupt and the project was suspended. After eight years the canal was about two-fifths completed, and about $234.8 million had been spent.\\r\\nThe company's collapse was a scandal in France, and the antisemitic Edouard Drumont exploited the role of two Jewish speculators in the affair. One hundred and four legislators were found to have been involved in the corruption, and Jean Jaurs was commissioned by the French parliament to conduct an inquiry which was completed in 1893.[2]\\r\\nIt soon became clear that the only way to recoup expenses for the stockholders was to continue the project. A new concession was obtained from Colombia, and in 1894 the Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama was created to finish the canal. To comply with the terms of the contract, work began immediately on the Culebra excavation while a team of engineers began a comprehensive study of the project. They eventually settled on a plan for a two-level, lock-based canal.\\r\\nThe new effort never gained traction, mainly because of US speculation that a canal through Nicaragua would render one through Panama useless. The most men employed on the new project was 3,600 (in 1896), primarily to comply with the terms of the concession and to maintain the existing excavation and equipment in saleable condition. The company had already begun looking for a buyer, with an asking price of $109 million.\\r\\nIn the US, a congressional Isthmian Canal Commission was established in 1899 to examine possibilities for a Central American canal and recommend a route. In November 1901, the commission reported that a US canal should be built through Nicaragua unless the French were willing to sell their holdings for $40 million. The recommendation became law on June 28, 1902, and the New Panama Canal Company was compelled to sell at that price.[3]\\r\\nAlthough the French effort was, to a large extent, doomed to failure from the beginning due to disease and a lack of understanding of the engineering difficulties, it was not entirely futile. The old and new companies excavated 59,747,638?m3 (78,146,960?cu?yd) of material, of which 14,255,890?m3 (18,646,000?cu?yd) was taken from the Culebra Cut. The old company dredged a channel from Panama Bay to the port at Balboa, and the channel dredged on the Atlantic side (known as the French canal) was useful for bringing in sand and stone for the locks and spillway concrete at Gat~n.\\r\\nDetailed surveys and studies (particularly those carried out by the new canal company) and machinery, including railroad equipment and vehicles, aided the later American effort. The French lowered the summit of the Culebra Cut along the canal route by five meters (17?ft), from 64 to 59 metres (210 to 194?ft). An estimated 22,713,396?m3 (29,708,000?cu?yd) of excavation, valued at about $25.4 million, and equipment and surveys valued at about $17.4 million were usable by the Americans.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe 1848 discovery of gold in California and the rush of would-be miners stimulated US interest in building a canal between the oceans. In 1887, a United States Army Corps of Engineers regiment surveyed canal possibilities in Nicaragua. Two years later, the Maritime Canal Company was asked to begin a canal in the area and chose Nicaragua. The company lost money in the panic of 1893, and its work in Nicaragua ceased. In 1897 and 1899, the United States Congress charged a canal commission with researching possible construction; Nicaragua was chosen as the location both times.\\r\\nAlthough the Nicaraguan canal proposal was made redundant by the American takeover of the French Panama Canal project, increases in shipping volume and ship sizes have revived interest in the project. A canal across Nicaragua accommodating post-Panamax ships or a rail link carrying containers between ports on either coast have been proposed.[citation needed]\\r\\nTheodore Roosevelt believed that a US-controlled canal across Central America was a vital strategic interest of the country. This idea gained wide circulation after the destruction of the USS Maine in Cuba on February 15, 1898. Reversing a Walker Commission decision in favor of a Nicaraguan canal, Roosevelt encouraged the acquisition of the French Panama Canal effort. George S. Morison was the only commission member who argued for the Panama location. The purchase of the French-held land for $40?million was authorized by the June 28, 1902 Spooner Act. Since Panama was then part of Colombia, Roosevelt began negotiating with that country to obtain the necessary rights. In early 1903 the HayÿHerrn Treaty was signed by both nations, but the Senate of Colombia failed to ratify the treaty.\\r\\nRoosevelt implied to Panamanian rebels that if they revolted, the US Navy would assist their fight for independence. Panama declared its independence on November 3, 1903, and the USS Nashville impeded Colombian interference. The victorious Panamanians gave the United States control of the Panama Canal Zone on February 23, 1904, for $10?million in accordance with the November 18, 1903 HayÿBunau-Varilla Treaty.\\r\\nThe United States took control of the French property connected to the canal on May 4, 1904, when Lieutenant Jatara Oneel of the United States Army was presented with the keys during a small ceremony.[citation needed] The new Panama Canal Zone Control was overseen by the Isthmian Canal Commission (ICC) during construction.\\r\\nThe first step taken by the US government was to place all the canal workers under the new administration. The operation was maintained at minimum strength to comply with the canal concession and keep the machinery in working order. The US inherited a small workforce and an assortment of buildings, infrastructure and equipment, much of which had been neglected for fifteen years in the humid jungle environment. There were no facilities in place for a large workforce, and the infrastructure was crumbling.\\r\\nCataloguing assets was a large job; it took many weeks to card-index available equipment. About 2,150 buildings had been acquired,[4] many of which were uninhabitable; housing was an early problem, and the Panama Railway was in a state of decay. However, much equipment (such as locomotives, dredges and other floating equipment) was still serviceable.\\r\\nAlthough chief engineer John Findley Wallace was pressured to resume construction, red tape from Washington stifled his efforts to obtain heavy equipment and caused friction between Wallace and the ICC. He and chief sanitary officer William C. Gorgas were frustrated by delay, and Wallace resigned in 1905. He was replaced by John Frank Stevens, who arrived on July 26, 1905. Stevens quickly realized that serious investment in infrastructure was necessary and determined to upgrade the railway, improve sanitation in Panama City and Col܇n, renovate the old French buildings and build hundreds of new ones for housing. He then began the difficult task of recruiting the large labor force required for construction. Stevens' approach was to press ahead first and obtain approval later. He improved drilling and dirt-removal equipment at the Culebra Cut for greater efficiency, revising the inadequate provisions in place for soil disposal.\\r\\nNo decision had been made about whether the canal should be a lock or a sea-level one; the ongoing excavation would be useful in either case. In late 1905, President Roosevelt sent a team of engineers to Panama to investigate the relative merits of both types in cost and time. Although the engineers voted eight to five in favor of a sea-level canal, Stevens and the ICC opposed the plan; Stevens' report to Roosevelt was instrumental in convincing the president of the merits of a lock canal and Congress concurred. In November 1906 Roosevelt visited Panama to inspect the canal's progress, the first trip outside the United States by a sitting president.\\r\\nWhether contract employees or government workers would build the canal was controversial. Bids for the canal's construction were opened in January 1907, and Knoxville, Tennessee-based contractor William J. Oliver was the low bidder. Stevens disliked Oliver, and vehemently opposed his choice. Although Roosevelt initially favored the use of a contractor, he eventually decided that army engineers should carry out the work[4] and appointed Major George Washington Goethals as chief engineer (under Stevens' direction) in February 1907. Stevens, frustrated by government inaction and the army involvement, resigned and was replaced by Goethals.[5]\\r\\nThe US relied on a stratified workforce to build the canal. High-level engineering jobs, clerical positions, skilled labor and jobs in supporting industries were generally reserved for white Americans, with manual labor primarily by cheap immigrant labor. These jobs were initially filled by Europeans, primarily from Spain, Italy and Greece, many of whom were radical and militant due to political turmoil in Europe. The US then decided to recruit primarily from the British and French West Indies, and these workers provided most of the manual labor on the canal.[6]\\r\\nThe Canal Zone originally had minimal facilities for entertainment and relaxation for the canal workers apart from saloons; as a result, alcohol abuse was a great problem. The inhospitable conditions resulted in many American workers returning home each year.\\r\\nA program of improvements was implemented. Clubhouses were built, managed by the YMCA, with billiard, assembly and reading rooms, bowling alleys, darkrooms for camera clubs, gymnastic equipment, ice cream parlors, soda fountains and a circulating library. Member dues were ten dollars a year, with the remaining upkeep (about $7,000 at the larger clubhouses) paid by the ICC. The commission built baseball fields and arranged rail transportation to games; a competitive league soon developed. Semimonthly Saturday-night dances were held at the Hotel Tivoli, which had a spacious ballroom.\\r\\nThese measures influenced life in the Canal Zone; alcohol abuse fell, with saloon business declining by 60 percent.[citation needed] The number of workers leaving the project each year dropped significantly.\\r\\nThe work done thus far was preparation, rather than construction. By the time Goethals took over, the construction infrastructure had been created or overhauled and expanded from the French effort and he was soon able to begin construction in earnest.\\r\\nGoethals divided the project into three divisions: Atlantic, Central and Pacific. The Atlantic Division, under Major William L. Sibert, was responsible for construction of the breakwater at the entrance to Limon Bay, the Gat~n locks and their 5.6?km (3.5?mi) approach channel, and the Gatun Dam. The Pacific Division (under Sydney B. Williamson, the only civilian division head) was responsible for the Pacific entrance to the canal, including a 4.8?km (3.0?mi) breakwater in Panama Bay, the approach channel, and the Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks and their associated dams. The Central Division, under Major David du Bose Gaillard, was responsible for everything in between. It had arguably the project's greatest challenge: excavating the Culebra Cut (known as the Gaillard Cut from 1915 to 2000), which involved cutting 8 miles (13?km) through the continental divide down to 12 meters (40?ft) above sea level.\\r\\nBy August 1907, 765,000 m3 (1,000,000 cubic yards) per month was being excavated; this set a record for the rainy season; soon afterwards this doubled, before increasing again. At the peak of production, 2,300,000 m3 (3,000,000 cubic yards) were being excavated per month (the equivalent of digging a Channel Tunnel every 3? months).[citation needed]\\r\\nOne of the greatest barriers to a canal was the continental divide, which originally rose to 110 metres (360.9?ft) above sea level at its highest point. The effort to cut through this barrier of rock was one of the greatest challenges faced by the project.\\r\\nGoethals arrived at the canal with Major David du Bose Gaillard of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Gaillard was placed in charge of the canal's Central Division, which stretched from the Pedro Miguel locks to the Gatun Dam, and dedicated himself to getting the Culebra Cut (as it was then known) excavated.\\r\\nThe scale of the work was massive. Six thousand men worked in the cut, drilling holes in which a total of 27,000?t (60,000,000?lb) of dynamite were placed to break up the rock (which was then removed by as many as 160 trains per day). Landslides were frequent, due to the oxidation and weakening of the rock's underlying iron strata. Although the scale of the job and the frequent, unpredictable slides generated chaos, Gaillard provided quiet, clear-sighted leadership.\\r\\nOn May 20, 1913, Bucyrus steam shovels made a passage through the Culebra Cut at the level of the canal bottom. The French effort had reduced the summit to 59 metres (193.6?ft) over a relatively narrow width; the Americans had lowered this to 12 metres (39.4?ft) above sea level over a greater width, and had excavated over 76,000,000?m3 (99,000,000?cu?yd) of material. About 23,000,000?m3 (30,000,000?cu?yd) of this material in addition to the planned excavation, in the form of landslides. Dry excavation ended on September 10, 1913; a January slide had added 1,500,000?m3 (2,000,000?cu?yd) of earth, but it was decided that this loose material would be removed by dredging when the cut was flooded.\\r\\nTwo artificial lakes are key parts of the canal: Gatun and Miraflores Lakes. Four dams were constructed to create them. Two small dams at Miraflores impound Miraflores Lake, and a dam at Pedro Miguel encloses the south end of the Culebra Cut (essentially an arm of Lake Gatun). The Gatun Dam is the main dam blocking the original course of the Chagres River, creating Gatun Lake.\\r\\nThe Miraflores dams are an 825-metre (2,707?ft) earth dam connecting the Miraflores Locks in the west and a 150-metre (492?ft) concrete spillway dam east of the locks. The concrete dam has eight floodgates, similar to those on the Gatun spillway. The earthen, 430-metre (1,411?ft) Pedro Miguel dam extends from a hill in the west to the lock. Its face is protected by rock riprap at the water level. The largest and most challenging of the dams is the Gatun Dam. This earthen dam, 640 metres (2,100?ft) thick at the base and 2,300 metres (7,546?ft) long along the top, was the largest of its kind in the world when the canal opened.[citation needed]\\r\\nBuilding the locks began with the first concrete laid at Gatun on August 24, 1909. The Gatun locks are built into a cutting into a hill bordering the lake, requiring the excavation of 3,800,000?m3 (4,970,212?cu?yd) of material (mostly rock). The locks were made of 1,564,400?m3 (2,046,158?cu?yd) of concrete, with an extensive system of electric railways and cable cars transporting concrete to the lock-construction sites.\\r\\nThe Pacific-side locks were finished first: the single flight at Pedro Miguel in 1911, and Miraflores in May 1913. The seagoing tugboat Gatun, an Atlantic-entrance tug used to haul barges, traversed the Gatun locks on September 26, 1913. The trip was successful, although the valves were controlled manually; the central control board was not yet ready.\\r\\nOn October 10, 1913, the dike at Gamboa which had kept the Culebra Cut isolated from Gatun Lake was demolished; the detonation was made telegraphically by President Woodrow Wilson in Washington. On January 7, 1914, the Alexandre La Valley, an old French crane boat, became the first ship to make a complete transit of the Panama Canal under its own steam after working its way across during the final stages of construction.\\r\\nAs construction wound down, the canal team began to disperse. Thousands of workers were laid off, and entire towns were disassembled or demolished. Chief sanitary officer William C. Gorgas, who left to fight pneumonia in the South African gold mines, became surgeon general of the Army. On April 1, 1914 the Isthmian Canal Commission disbanded, and the zone was governed by a Canal Zone Governor; the first governor was George Washington Goethals.\\r\\nAlthough a large celebration was planned for the canal's opening, the outbreak of World War I forced the cancellation of the main festivities and it became a modest local affair. The Panama Railway steamship SS?Ancon, piloted by Captain John A. Constantine (the canal's first pilot), made the first official transit on August 15, 1914. With no international dignitaries in attendance, Goethals followed the Ancon's progress by railroad.\\r\\nThe canal was a technological marvel and an important strategic and economic asset to the US. It changed world shipping patterns, removing the need for ships to navigate the Drake Passage and Cape Horn. The canal saves a total of about 7,800 miles (12,600?km) on a sea trip from New York to San Francisco.\\r\\nIts anticipated military significance of the canal was proven during World War II, when the canal helped restore the devastated United States Pacific Fleet.[7] Some of the largest ships the United States had to send through the canal were aircraft carriers, particularly Essex class; they were so large that although the locks could accommodate them, the lampposts along the canal had to be removed.\\r\\nThe Panama Canal cost the United States about $375 million, including $10 million paid to Panama and $40 million paid to the French company. Although it was the most expensive construction project in US history to that time, it cost about $23 million less than the 1907 estimate despite landslides and an increase in the canal's width. An additional $12 million was spent on fortifications.\\r\\nA total of over 75,000 people worked on the project; at the peak of construction, there were 40,000 workers. According to hospital records, 5,609 workers died from disease and accidents during the American construction era.[citation needed]\\r\\nA total of 182,610,550?m3 (238,845,582?cu?yd) of material was excavated in the American effort, including the approach channels at the canal ends. Adding the work by the French, the total excavation was about 204,900,000?m3 (268,000,000?cu?yd) (over 25 times the volume excavated in the Channel Tunnel project).[citation needed]\\r\\nOf the three presidents whose terms spanned the construction period, Theodore Roosevelt is most associated with the canal and Woodrow Wilson presided over its opening. However, William Howard Taft may have given the canal its greatest impetus for the longest time. Taft visited Panama five times as Roosevelt's secretary of war and twice as president. He hired John Stevens and later recommended Goethals as Stevens' replacement. Taft became president in 1909, when the canal was half finished, and was in office for most of the remainder of the work. However, Goethals later wrote: \\"The real builder of the Panama Canal was Theodore Roosevelt\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nThe following words by Roosevelt are displayed in the rotunda of the canal's administration building in Balboa:[citation needed]\\r\\nIt is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement; and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.\\r\\nDavid du Bose Gaillard died of a brain tumor in Baltimore on December 5, 1913, at age 54. Promoted to colonel only a month earlier, Gaillard never saw the opening of the canal whose creation he directed. The Culebra Cut (as it was originally known) was renamed the Gaillard Cut on April 27, 1915, in his honor. A plaque commemorating Gaillard's work stood over the cut for many years; in 1998 it was moved to the administration building, near a memorial to Goethals.\\r\\nAs the situation in Europe deteriorated during the late 1930s, the US again became concerned about its ability to move warships between the oceans. The largest US battleships already had problems with the canal locks, and there were concerns about the locks being incapacitated by bombing.[8][9]\\r\\nThese concerns led Congress to pass a resolution on May 1, 1936, authorizing a study of improving the canal's defenses against attack and expanding its capacity to handle large vessels. A special engineering section was created on July 3, 1937, to carry out the study. The section reported to Congress on February 24, 1939, recommending work to protect the existing locks and the construction of a new set of locks capable of carrying larger vessels than the existing locks could accommodate. On August 11, Congress authorized the work.\\r\\nThree new locks were planned, at Gat~n, Pedro Miguel and Miraflores, parallel to the existing locks with new approach channels. The new locks would add a traffic lane to the canal, with each chamber 1,200?ft (365.76?m) long, 140?ft (42.67?m) wide and 45?ft (13.72?m) deep. They would be 1?2?mi (805?m) east of the existing Gat~n locks and 1?4?mi (402?m) west of the Pedro Miguel and Miraflores locks.\\r\\nThe first excavations for the new approach channels at Miraflores began on July 1, 1940, following the passage by Congress of an appropriations bill on June 24, 1940. The first dry excavation at Gat~n began on February 19, 1941. Considerable material was excavated before the project was abandoned, and the approach channels can still be seen paralleling the original channels at Gat~n and Miraflores.\\r\\nIn 2006, the Autoridad del Canal de Panam (the Panama Canal Authority, or ACP) proposed a plan creating a third lane of locks using part of the abandoned 1940s approach canals. Following a referendum, work began in 2007 and the expanded canal began commercial operations on June 26, 2016. After a two-year delay, the new locks allow the transit of Panamax ships (which have a greater cargo capacity than the original locks can handle). The first ship to cross the canal through the third set of locks was a Panamax container ship, the Chinese-owned Cosco Shipping Panama. The cost of the expansion was estimated at $5.25 billion.[2]\\r\\nAfter construction, the canal and the Canal Zone surrounding it were administered by the United States. On September 7, 1977, US President Jimmy Carter signed the Torrijos-Carter Treaty setting in motion the process of transferring control of the canal to Panama. The treaty became effective on October 1, 1979, providing for a 20-year period in which Panama would have increasing responsibility for canal operations before complete US withdrawal on December 31, 1999. Since then, the canal has been administered by the Panama Canal Authority (Autoridad de Canal de Panama, or ACP).\\r\\nThe treaty was controversial in the US, and its passage was difficult. The controversy was largely generated by contracts to manage two ports, at either end of the canal, which were awarded by Panama to Hong Kong-based conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa. According to US Republicans, the company has close ties to the Chinese government and the Chinese military.[10] However, the United States Department of State said that it found no evidence of connections between Hutchison Whampoa and Beijing.[11] Some Americans were wary of placing the strategic waterway under the protection of Panamanian security forces.[12]\\r\\nAlthough concerns existed in the US and the shipping industry about the canal after the transfer, Panama has exercised good stewardship.[13] According to ACP figures, canal income increased from $769?million in 2000 (the first year under Panamanian control) to $1.4?billion in 2006.[citation needed] Traffic through the canal increased from 230 million tons in 2000 to nearly 300?million tons in 2006. The number of accidents has decreased from an average of 28 per year in the late 1990s to 12 in 2005. Transit time through the canal averages about 30 hours, about the same as during the late 1990s. Canal expenses have increased less than revenue, from $427?million in 2000 to $497?million in 2006. On October 22, 2006, Panamanian citizens approved a referendum to expand the canal.\\r\\nFormer US Ambassador to Panama Linda Watt, who served from 2002 to 2005, said that the canal operation in Panamanian hands has been \\"outstanding\\". \\"The international shipping community is quite pleased\\", Watt added.[14]","input":"What country was the original builder of the panama canal?"},{"output":"Sully Prudhomme of France","context":"The Nobel Prize in Literature (Swedish: Nobelpriset i litteratur) is awarded annually by the Swedish Academy to authors for outstanding contributions in the field of literature.

Cohen dropped out of school.[2] In 1977, Cohen and Greenfield completed a correspondence course on ice cream making from Pennsylvania State University's creamery. Cohen has severe anosmia, a lack of a sense of smell or taste, and so relied on \\"mouth feel\\" and texture to provide variety in his diet. This led to the company's trademark chunks being mixed in with their ice cream.[3] On May 5, 1978, with a $12,000[4] investment, the two business partners opened an ice cream parlor in a renovated gas station in downtown Burlington, Vermont. In 1979, they marked their anniversary by holding the first-ever free cone day, now an international annual celebration at every Ben & Jerry's store.[3]\\r\\nIn 1980, they rented space in an old spool and bobbin mill on South Champlain Street in Burlington and started packing their ice cream in pints. In 1981, the first Ben & Jerry's franchise opened on Route 7 in Shelburne, Vermont. In 1983, Ben & Jerrys ice cream was used to build the worlds largest ice cream sundae in St. Albans, Vermont; the sundae weighed 27,102 pounds (12,293?kg). That same year, the cows on their cartons were redesigned by local artist Woody Jackson.[5]\\r\\nIn 1984, H?agen-Dazs wanted to limit distribution of Ben & Jerrys in Boston, prompting Ben & Jerrys to file suit against the parent company, Pillsbury, in its now famous Whats the Doughboy Afraid Of? campaign.[6] In 1987, H?agen-Dazs again tried to enforce exclusive distribution, and Ben & Jerrys filed its second lawsuit against the Pillsbury Company.\\r\\nIn 1985, the Ben & Jerrys Foundation was established at the end of the year with a gift from Ben & Jerry's to fund community-oriented projects; it was then provided with 7.5% of the companys annual pre-tax profits. In 1986, Ben & Jerrys launched its Cowmobile, a modified mobile home used to distribute free scoops of Ben & Jerrys ice cream in a unique, cross-country marketing drive쨕driven and served by Ben and Jerry themselves. The Cowmobile burned to the ground outside of Cleveland four months later, but there were no injuries. Ben said it looked like the worlds largest baked Alaska.[7]\\r\\nIn 1988, the two men won the title of U.S. Small Business Persons Of The Year, awarded by U.S. President Ronald Reagan.[8] Also that year, the first brownies were ordered from Greyston Bakery, which led to the development of the popular Chocolate Fudge Brownie flavor.[9] In 1992, Ben & Jerrys joined in a co-operative campaign with the national non-profit Children's Defense Fund; the campaign goal was to bring childrens basic needs to the top of the national agenda. Over 70,000 postcards were sent to Congress concerning kids and other national issues. In 1995, they hired Robert Holland, Jr. as CEO after holding a \\"Yo! I'm your C.E.O.\\" essay contest as part of the search.[10] Holland left after 20 months following philosophical differences and was replaced by Perry Odak in 1997.[11]\\r\\nIn 1989, Ben & Jerrys revealed their opposition of the use of rBGH (recombinant bovine growth hormone) in all their products. This genetically engineered hormone is sometimes given to cows in order to boost milk production, but Ben & Jerrys does not support this practice and is in favor of utilizing less chemically intensive ingredients for the safety of consumers and the environment.[12]\\r\\nIn 1994, Ben & Jerry's: The Inside Scoop, written by Fred \\"Chico\\" Lager, former CEO of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, was published. This book tracks the history of how Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream got started. The book focuses on \\"How Two Real Guys Built a Business with a Social Conscience and a Sense of Humor.\\"[13]\\r\\nIn April 2000, Ben & Jerry's sold the company to Anglo-Dutch multinational food giant Unilever.[14] Unilever said it hopes to carry on the tradition of engaging \\"in these critical, global economic and social missions\\". Although the founders' names are still attached to the product, they do not hold any board or management position and are not involved in day-to-day management of the company.[15]\\r\\nIn 2001, Ben & Jerry's U.S. completed the transition to \\"Eco-Pint\\" packaging, which packaged all pint flavors in environmentally friendly unbleached paperboard Eco-Pint containers, a decision it later reversed. The use of brown-kraft unbleached paperboard had been a critical first step toward a totally biodegradable pint made without added chlorine. Due to what they described as increasing supply, quality, and cost challenges, Ben & Jerry's discontinued their use of the Eco-Pint in 2006, transitioning to a pint container made out of a bleached paperboard that it said was more readily available.[16]\\r\\nOn Earth Day in 2005, when a vote in the U.S. Senate proposed the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, Ben & Jerry's launched a protest by creating the largest ever Baked Alaska, which weighed 900 pounds (410?kg), and placed it in front of the U.S. Capitol Building.[17][18]\\r\\nIn March 2009, \\"CyClone Dairy\\"[19] launched an advertising campaign and a website to promote its milk products, which purportedly came exclusively from cloned cows.[20] On April 1, 2009 (April Fool's Day), Ben & Jerry's announced that it was behind this fake company. Ben & Jerry's had created the tongue-in-cheek hoax to raise awareness of the increasing presence of products from cloned animals within American food[21][22] and to campaign for a tracking system of cloned-animal products.[23] The hoax was revealed on April Fool's Day with the message: \\"We believe you should have the right to choose which foods you eat ÿ and not to eat cloned foods if you dont want to. And that's why Ben & Jerrys believes we need a national clone tracking system, so people and companies can know where their food is coming from.\\"[24]\\r\\nIn 2010, Jostein Solheim, a Unilever executive from Norway, became the new CEO of the company and had this to say about the transition: \\"My mantra that I've repeated a hundred times since starting at Ben & Jerry's is: Change is a wonderful thing,'\\" he said. \\"The world needs dramatic change to address the social and environmental challenges we are facing. Values led businesses can play a critical role in driving that positive change. We need to lead by example, and prove to the world that this is the best way to run a business. Historically, this company has been and must continue to be a pioneer to continually challenge how business can be a force for good and address inequities inherent in global business.\\"[25]\\r\\nOn February 24, 2012, Ben & Jerry's released a new Greek Frozen Yogurt line, which came in several flavors: \\"Strawberry Shortcake\\", \\"Blueberry Vanilla Graham\\", \\"Raspberry Fudge Chunk\\", \\"Banana Peanut Butter\\",[26] and \\"Vanilla\\" (scoop shop exclusive):[27] On April 12, 2013, \\"Pineapple Passionfruit\\", \\"Vanilla Honey Caramel\\", and \\"Liz Lemon\\" were added to the Greek Yogurt line.[28] The Liz Lemon flavor was inspired by a character of the same name created by actress Tina Fey as the main character on the NBC television sitcom 30 Rock.[29]\\r\\nIn 2013, Ben & Jerrys committed to making their products GMO-free in support of mandatory GMO labeling legislation.[30]\\r\\nThe \\"Vermonster\\" is a large ice cream sundae served in a \\"Vermonster Bucket\\" in Ben & Jerry's \\"scoop shops.\\" Its ingredients are 20 scoops of ice cream, 4 bananas, 4 ladles of hot fudge, 3 chocolate chip cookies, 1 chocolate fudge brownie, 10 scoops of walnuts, 2 scoops each of any 4 toppings, and whipped cream. It contains 14,000 calories (kcal), and 500 grams (17.64?oz) of fat. Since 2009, the Vermonster Challenge is an annual charity event held by Ben & Jerry's in which teams of four compete to finish a Vermonster and win free ice cream for a year.[31]\\r\\n\\"Chubby Hubby\\" consists of vanilla malt ice cream swirled with fudge and peanut butter, and containing pretzel nuggets covered in fudge and filled with peanut butter. During the month of September 2009, Ben and Jerry's, in partnership with Freedom to Marry, renamed \\"Chubby Hubby\\" to \\"Hubby Hubby,\\" in celebration of the legalization of same-sex marriage in the company's home state of Vermont. The carton featured the image of two men getting married beneath a rainbow.[32][33][34]\\r\\nOn March 13, 2012, Ben & Jerrys announced it would be changing the name of one of its ice cream flavours in the UK in support of equal marriage rights for same-sex couples. \\"Oh! My! Apple Pie!\\" would become \\"Apple-y Ever After\\" and tubs would feature a gay couple atop a wedding cake decorated with rainbows.[35]\\r\\n\\"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough\\" was temporarily renamed \\"I Dough, I Dough\\" in the United States during the summer of 2015. This was in celebration of United States Supreme Court's ruling in support of same-sex marriage. The proceeds from sales were to go to the Human Rights Campaign (a nonprofit advocacy group for LGBT rights).[36]\\r\\nBen Cohen and Jerry Greenfield appeared on The Colbert Report on March 5, 2007, to promote their new ice cream flavor, \\"Stephen Colbert's AmeriCone Dream\\", and Cohen's progressive advocacy group TrueMajority.\\r\\nThe company renamed a flavour, \\"Yes Pecan!\\", in reference to Barack Obama's victory in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. They decided in January 2009 to donate all proceeds made on the sale of that flavor to the Common Cause Education Fund.[37]\\r\\nOn March 2, 2011, Cohen and Greenfield appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and unveiled their new flavour of ice cream, \\"Late Night Snack\\", whose carton features a picture of Jimmy Fallon on it.[38]\\r\\nOn February 17, 2015, Cohen and Greenfield appeared on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon and unveiled their new flavor of ice cream, \\"The Tonight Dough\\", which all of its proceeds go to the SeriousFun Children's Network that supports camps for children with major illnesses.[39]\\r\\nIn 2015, Charoset flavoured ice cream became widely available in time for the Passover holiday.[40][41][42][43][44][45]\\r\\nIn April 2015, the company confirmed that it was working on vegan options, after hearing consumers' feedback, led by a petition and FARM organization.[46] In early February 2016, the company announced a new all-vegan line with 4 flavors. Two of these are versions of existing flavors - \\"Chunky Monkey\\" and \\"Chocolate Fudge Brownie\\" - and two are all-new vegan-only flavors: \\"Coffee Caramel Fudge\\" and \\"Peanut Butter & Cookies\\".[47]\\r\\nFree Cone Day is an annual event held between late March and early May, in which Ben & Jerry's scoop shops give out free ice cream cups and cones. Free Cone Day was first held on Saturday, May 5, 1979, by Ben and Jerry as a customer and staff appreciation event for the first anniversary of their store's opening.\\r\\nOver one million free cones are given away each year, prompting the company's ad slogan \\"Be One In A Million.\\" Charitable organizations are often present at the stores each year and enjoy a significant amount of fundraising success. Often, local celebrities show up at various stores, promoting the day and the charities there.[48] Sometimes the event is scheduled to coincide with Earth Day and sometimes volunteers are on hand with clipboards and voter registration forms to help those who would like to register to vote.\\r\\nThe Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer-advocacy group, urged Ben & Jerry's to stop labeling their ice cream as \\"all natural,\\" due to the company's use of corn syrup, alkalised cocoa, and other chemically modified ingredients.[49] In September 2010, the company agreed to stop labeling their ice cream and frozen yogurt as \\"all natural.\\"[50]\\r\\nIn 2011, Ben & Jerry's released a flavor named Schweddy Balls, in homage to the Saturday Night Live (SNL) skit of the same name. An American group named \\"One Million Moms\\" protested, saying that the name was too explicit for grocery store shelvesspokesperson Monica Cole explained to the media: \\"I realize it could be a lot worse, but are they going to progressively get worse if we don't say something? Maybe they'll think twice before they come up with another inappropriate name for ice cream.\\" However, the expression of disdain was not unanimous among U.S. parents, as mother Gina Ragusa said to The Huffington Post: \\"We just think it's funny, that's all, and honestly we all really want to try it\\", adding that she consistently checks for the item's availability at her local supermarket.[51] Actor Alec Baldwin, who appeared in the SNL skit as baker Pete Schweddy, hosted the September 24, 2011 episode of the 37th season of the show and responded to the protests by stating that a new flavor called \\"Go Fudge Yourself\\" had been produced for those in opposition to the tribute. Following the initial release of the flavor, Baldwin informed the media that \\"thanks to Ben & Jerry's, the goodness of the Schweddy family recipe won't go with me to the great beyond,\\" as he had previously feared that his association with the SNL episode would remain permanent until his death.[52]\\r\\nFollowing rumors that suggested that Ben & Jerry's supported the defense of Mumia Abu-Jamalwho was convicted in 1982 of killing Philadelphia Police officer Daniel Faulkner[53]the company confirmed that Cohen did sign a petition, as a private citizen, asking that \\"the system of American justice be followed fully in the case\\".[54]\\r\\nControversy emerged in 2006 after the company released a flavor of ice cream called \\"Black and Tan\\". It had named the flavor after the alcoholic drink, which is made by mixing stout with pale ale, but the \\"Black and Tans\\" are also known as a paramilitary police force of British World War I veterans recruited during the Irish Revolution. At the time that the flavor was released, the Irish nationalist movement was still offended by the historical association of the title.[55]\\r\\nIn 2012, Vermonters for a Just Peace in Palestine/Israel (VTJP)[56] contacted Ben Cohen, Jerry Greenfield and the CEO of Ben & Jerrys after learning that ice cream produced by Ben & Jerrys franchise in Israel[57] was being sold in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Leafleting occurred at locations in Vermont, New York and California on 'Free Cone Day' in April 2013[58] and April 2014.[59] As of November 2014[update], 232 organizations across the United States and in seventeen countries worldwide have signed a letter written by VTJP calling on Ben & Jerry's to end its commercial ties to such settlements.[60]\\r\\nIn late April 2014, Ben & Jerry's signed onto the \\"Fight for the Reef\\" campaign, a partnership between the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)-Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS). Premier Campbell Newman and Queensland state senator Matthew Canavan both said in statements that Ben & Jerry's was making misleading statements that exaggerated the detrimental impact that proposed government programs would have on the Great Barrier Reef,[61][61] and Environment Minister Andrew Powell said that \\"The only people taking a scoop out of the reef is Ben and Jerrys and Unilever. If you understand the facts, youd want to be boycotting Ben and Jerrys\\". Australian Ben & Jerry's brand manager Kalli Swaik responded that \\"Ben & Jerrys believes that dredging and dumping in world heritage waters surrounding the marine park area will be detrimental to the reef ecology. It threatens the health of one of Australias most iconic treasures.\\"[62]\\r\\nIn April 2016, Ben & Jerry's cofounders, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, were both arrested at the Democracy Awakening protests on the U.S. Capitol steps in Washington, D.C.[63]\\r\\nIn May 2017, Ben and Jerry's announced they would not serve two scoops of the same ice cream flavor in Australia, due to the refusal of the Australian government to legalize same-sex marriage. They said this would encourage \\"fans to contact their MP's to tell them the time has come-make marriage equality legal!\\". This stance they said will continue for however long it takes for same-sex marriage to be legalized.[64][65]\\r\\nIn February 2012, a Ben & Jerry's franchise near Harvard University created a limited edition frozen yogurt flavor named \\"Taste the Lin-Sanity,\\" in honor of Asian-American basketball player Jeremy Lin, a Harvard alumnus. At inception, the product contained vanilla frozen yogurt, lychee honey swirls, and fortune cookie pieces, leading to a widely publicized controversy about racial stereotyping due to the association of the fortune cookie ingredient with Chinese culture. The latter ingredient was later replaced with waffle cookies, as the fortune cookies became soggy and the franchise received returns from customers. Ben & Jerry's general manager for Boston and Cambridge explained to the media: \\"we obviously weren't looking to offend anybody and the majority of the feedback about it has been positive.\\"[66] Ben & Jerry's released an official statement shortly after the launch of the product apologizing to those who were offended.[67]\\r\\nIn September 2014, anti-hazing activists raised concerns about the ice cream flavor \\"Hazed & Confused,\\" which had been released earlier that year. The concern was that the name could be perceived as belittling of hazing and bullying problems. The company has noted that the name was based on the word hazelnut and a play on the phrase \\"dazed and confused\\", which is both a song popularized by Led Zeppelin and a coming-of-age comedy film from the early 1990s.[68] The decision was made in October to not rename the flavor.[69]\\r\\nThe Organic Consumers Association announced in July 2017 that it found traces of the herbicide glyphosate in 10 of 11 samples of the companys ice creams.[70] The traces were found to be at levels below the ceiling set by the Environmental Protection Agency for environmental contamination.\\r\\nBen and Jerry's has locations around the world.[71]\\r\\nBen & Jerry's used to have a policy that no employee's rate of pay shall exceed five times that of entry-level employees.[75] In 1995, entry-level employees were paid $12 hourly, and the highest paid employee was President and Chief Operating Officer Chuck Lacy, who earned $150,000 annually. When Ben Cohen resigned as Chief Executive Officer and Ben & Jerry's announced the search for a new CEO in 1995, the company ended the five-to-one-ratio policy.[76]","input":"Who owns ben & jerry's ice cream company?"},{"output":"Vegeta","context":"Son Goku (Japanese: ?O iZ, Hepburn: Son Gok) is a fictional character and main protagonist of the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He is based on Sun Wukong, a main character in the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. Goku first made his debut in Dragon Ball chapter #1 Bulma and Son Goku (ƤѨ?OiZ, Buruma to Son Gok), originally published in Japan's Weekly Shnen Jump magazine on December 3, 1984,[1] as an eccentric, monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and joins her on a journey to find the wish-granting Dragon Balls.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially believed to have been born on Earth, Goku later learns that he is a member of an extraterrestrial warrior race called the Saiyans, which is also the reason for his superhuman strength, and his birth name is Kakarot (Ё, Kakarotto). As Goku grows up, he becomes the Earths mightiest warrior and protects his adopted home planet from those who seek to harm it. Goku is depicted as carefree and cheerful when at ease, but quickly serious and strategic-minded when in battle and also enthusiastic to fight. He is able to concentrate his Ki and use it for devastatingly powerful energy-based attacks; the most prominent being his signature Kamehameha (), in which Goku launches a blue energy blast from his palms. Also pure of heart, Goku has frequently granted mercy to his enemies, which has often earned him additional allies in the process (though has also resulted in others taking advantage of his kindness), and he is one of the few who can ride the magic cloud called Kinto'un (\`?, lit. \\"Somersault Cloud\\", renamed \\"Flying Nimbus\\" in Funimation's dub); which was another element adapted from Journey to the West.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the protagonist, Goku appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT, Dragon Ball Super and Dragon Ball Heroes) as well as many of the franchise's video games. Due to the series' international popularity, Goku has become one of the most recognizable and iconic characters in the world. Outside the Dragon Ball franchise, Goku has made cameo appearances in Toriyama's self-parody series Neko Majin Z, has been the subject of other parodies, and has appeared in special events. Most Western audiences were introduced to the adult version of Goku appearing in the Dragon Ball Z anime, itself an adaptation of Dragon Ball manga volumes 17-42, as opposed to his initial child form, due to the limited success of the first series overseas.[3] Goku's critical reception has been largely positive and he is often considered to be the greatest manga and anime character of all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoku, and Dragon Ball in general, evolved from one of Akira Toriyama's earlier one-shot series called Dragon Boy. In this story, the protagonist looks a lot like Goku but has a pair of wings.[4] The character Goku is based on Sun Wukong (?OiZ), the central character of the Chinese novel Journey to the West.[5] To be creative with the idea of Sun Wukong, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy with a monkey's tail, rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give the character a distinguishing feature.[6] He later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on.[7] Toriyama did not initially plan to make Goku an alien, it was not until the introduction of fighters from other planets that he established him as a Saiyan (??, Saiya-jin).[8] Goku was given the ability to teleport to any planet in seconds, so that Toriyama could increase the pace of the story.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nWanting Dragon Ball z  to have a Chinese appearance, Toriyama used the color of the robes worn by Buddhist monks for Goku's dgi.[10] During the early chapters of the manga, Toriyama's editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, commented that Goku looked rather plain. Toriyama had given him simple clothes on purpose because it was a fighting manga, so to combat this he added several characters like Master Roshi and Krillin, and created the Tenkaichi Budkai (BH, lit. \\"Strongest Under the Heavens Martial Arts Tournament\\") to focus the storyline on fighting. To defy the assumption that Goku would win the tournaments, Toriyama made him lose the first and second but win the third.[6] Toriyama also mentioned Torishima wanted Goku to form a relationship with Bulma, but this was never applied to the series.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nToriyama's editor was initially against having Goku grow up, saying it was uncommon to have the protagonist drastically change in manga, however, he gave in when Toriyama threatened that he would not be able to continue the series if the character did not.[12] Toriyama later stated he had him grow up as a means to make drawing the fight scenes easier.[13] When Toriyama thought up the Super Saiyan (] ()??, Sp Saiya-jin) concept during the Frieza arc, he felt the only way to show Goku's massive power up was to have him transform. Initially he was concerned that the facial expression looked like that of a villain, but felt that since the transformation was brought about by anger it was acceptable.[14] With the conclusion of the Cell arc, Gohan was intended to replace his father as protagonist, but Toriyama decided that Gohan was unsuitable for the role.[6] According to Toriyama, Goku is more of a selfish person than a hero as his main interest in the story is to fight strong opponents rather than protecting the innocent. As a result, Toriyama was angered when the anime adaptations of Dragon Ball started portraying Goku as more heroic than his manga counterpart.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nDragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's zaru (ܥ, lit. \\"Great Ape\\") form, he made the hair more \\"wild\\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the plans of the final story arc of Dragon Ball Super, it was decided that Goku should have another transformation: The Ultra Instinct. The concept was that the Ultra Instinct would be completely different from Goku's previous Super Saiyan transformations.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoku is usually recognized by his unique hairstyle, which does not change in length except in his Super Saiyan forms; where his hair changes in color and length according to the form he takes. This is explained by Vegeta to be a common characteristic of full-blooded Saiyans.[18] Goku's hair color changes from black to golden after ascending to a Super Saiyan, and his irises change from black to turquoise. In his Super Saiyan God form, both his hair color and irises change to a deep red. In his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form, both his hair color and irises change to blue (hence its nickname \\"Super Saiyan Blue\\"). Goku prefers dressing in a dgi uniform to show his devotion to Earth, instead of the standard battle fatigues of his race;[19] the only time he actually does wear these garments is during his training with Gohan before the Cell Games.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his early childhood, Goku is introduced wearing a dark colored dgi uniform with red wristbands and a white obi tied in a bow over the waist. Throughout the majority of the series, however, Goku is commonly seen wearing a red-orange dgi uniform with a blue short-sleeved undershirt, blue wristbands, a blue obi tied in a knot over the waist, and dark boots with yellow or red stripes. Goku also often wears the encircled kanji of his training masters on the front and back of this uniform; the first being Master Roshi's, \\"kame\\" (?w, meaning \\"turtle\\");[21] the second being King Kai's, \\"kaio\\" (nt, meaning \\"world king\\");[22] and the third being his own, \\"Go\\" (i, meaning \\"wisdom\\" or \\"enlightenment\\").[23] Eventually, Goku stops wearing a kanji on his outfit[24] and wears his obi as a sash around his waist.[24] In Dragon Ball GT, he wears a multi-colored dgi that consists of a blue fold-over shirt, yellow pants, pink wristbands, a white obi tied in a knot over the waist, and black shoes with white stockings.[25] In Dragon Ball Super, Goku  wears his signature red-orange and blue dgi with his \\"Go\\" kanji again, though during the Golden Frieza arc and Universe 6 arc he wears a slightly different dgi uniform consisting of an orange fold-over shirt and matching pants with blue wristbands, blue boots and a blue obi tied in a knot at the side of his waist (which debuted in the film Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F').\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Japanese version of every Dragon Ball anime series and subsequent related media, Goku has been voiced by Masako Nozawa. Toriyama selected Nozawa upon hearing her audition sample, remarking that only Goku could sound like that.[26] Nozawa stated that she was ecstatic when she got the role because she had always wanted to be in one of Toriyama's works. She said she had to be mindful of the fact that Goku grew up in the mountains and did not know much of the world. Despite having to voice Goku, Gohan, Goten and Bardock, Nozawa claims she is able to instantly get into the respective character simply upon seeing their image.[27] Nozawa explained that she did not read the manga so that she would not know what was coming in the story until recording, making her reactions the same as Goku's.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the numerous English versions, Goku has been played by different actors because different companies produced the dubs, by reason of changes of ADR companies and recording studios, or due to actors quitting:\\r\\n\\r\\nGoku first appears in Dragon Ball as a monkey-tailed child adopted by the hermit Gohan. Before the series' narrative begins, he accidentally and unknowingly kills Gohan on a full-moon night when he temporarily transforms into the mighty zaru after staring at a full moon. However, Goku loses the ability when his friends cut off his tail.[38] Living alone with an item known as a Dragon Ball which he keeps as a memento of Gohan, Goku befriends a teenage girl named Bulma. He joins her to find the seven Dragon Balls, which, when gathered, summon the wish-granting dragon Shenron. They encounter the desert bandit Yamcha and two shapeshifters named Oolong and Puar, who also join their quest. Goku is later trained by the martial artist Master Roshi, alongside a Shaolin monk named Krillin, who becomes his best friend. It is Roshi who gives Goku the Nimbus cloud (as a reward for saving his pet sea turtle), which becomes Goku's primary source of flight travel across the world. Goku's first shown martial arts attack as a child is Jan ken (Ҽ??), three physical blows modeled after the hand signs in rock-paper-scissors.[39] As a child, he also wields the Nyoi-b (?uE?, lit. \\"Mind Stick\\", renamed \\"Power Pole\\" in Funimation's dub), a magic staff that extends and retracts on command; given to him by his late grandfather.[40] However, Goku's signature attack is the Kamehameha, which he learned from Master Roshi.[41] The Kamehameha is a concentration of Ki, released as a concussive beam. Roshi spent about 50 years developing and perfecting the technique, but, as a child, Goku is able to understand and copy the technique immediately after only one demonstration. After training with the Earth's god, Kami, Goku learns to fly by virtue of the technique Buk-jutsu (Z, lit. \\"Air Dance Technique\\") and uses the Nimbus less frequently for flight travel. While participating in the World Martial Arts Tournament that attracts the most powerful fighters in the world, Goku battles foes, later turned allies, such as Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu, as well as the Namekian Piccolo. After becoming the runner-up champion of the 21st and 22nd tournaments, Goku finally wins in the 23rd with Piccolo's defeat, and marries Chi-Chi soon after.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] \\r\\nIn order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai-ken (nt??, lit. \\"World King Fist\\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (??, lit. \\"Energy Sphere\\", renamed \\"Spirit Bomb\\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id (Q??, lit. \\"Instant Teleport\\", renamed \\"Instant Transmission\\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is fully restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (ì, Bejitto, \\"Vegerot\\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter defeating Majin Buu, Goku meets a new opponent known as Beerus, the God of Destruction in the film Battle of Gods. An alternative, more innately powerful form known as the Super Saiyan God (] ()?ހҾ?, Sp Saiya-jin Goddo) is reached by Goku during this film. Though the temporary transformation wears off, Goku manages to harness its godly powers in his base Super Saiyan form. In its sequel film Resurrection 'F', Goku manages to achieve a blue-haired evolution of Super Saiyan God under Whis's tutelage, known as the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (] ()?ހҾS (??), Sp Saiya-jin Goddo Sp Saiya-jin) or \\"Super Saiyan Blue\\" for short, which Goku uses to battle the newly revived Frieza.[50] These forms also appear in Dragon Ball Super and its manga tie-in, which expand upon the stories from the two films, and replace them as the new canon. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfterwards, Goku and his friends participate in a fighting tournament set between Beerus and his brother Champa, facing warriors from the universe Champa oversees as its God of Destruction. During this tournament, Goku reveals that he has learned to combine the perfect ki control of his Super Saiyan Blue form with his older technique, the Kai-ken; creating a variation called \\"Super Saiyan Blue Kai-ken\\". Although Goku gives up after fighting his opponent, Hit, his team ends up winning the tournament. After meeting with the omnipotent being known as Zeno, Goku encounters an evil alternate version of himself called \\"Goku Black\\", who is terrorizing Future Trunks' timeline. Black is eventually revealed to be a rogue Kai named Zamasu, who has stolen Goku's body from yet another alternate timeline and teamed up with the Zamasu of Future Trunks' timeline to fulfill their \\"Zero Mortals Plan\\". After Zamasu and Black become even more dangerous by undergoing Potara Fusion during the battle in Future Trunks' timeline, Goku ultimately summons the future version of Zeno who erases the entire universe and Zamasu. Goku and the others present there manage to escape in their time machine, and later Goku and Future Trunks use the time machine again to bring Future Zeno to the present timeline. \\r\\n\\r\\nLater, Goku requests Whis to hire Hit to assassinate himself, but his reasoning behind this is to get another chance to fight Hit. Shortly afterwards, Goku causes the Zenos to decide to hold a multi-universal martial arts tournament with the losing universes wiped from existence. After enlisting nine of his allies to fight alongside him in the \\"Tournament of Power\\", Goku ends up recruiting Frieza as well.[51] Across the tournament, Goku defeats multiple warriors, but is nearly killed by one named Jiren. During this fight, Goku reaches a form known as ultra instinct omen and eventually masters this new form labeled as Ultra Instinct (?飯\`?O). All of a sudden, Jiren fires an energy blast at the stands housing the remaining members of the tournament. Goku immediately gets in the way of the attack, and deflects the energy blast away from his friends. Goku then overwhelms Jiren in a fit of rage until succumbing to his power's immense pressure as it fades, causing his body to spasm while appearing to be defeated. Luckily, Android 17 and Frieza are still in the tournament as they team up with only the former left in the ring. Goku and Frieza actually work together to force Jiren out of bounds in a triple elimination. After Android 17 uses his wish on the Super Dragon Balls to restore the erased universes, Goku and his team part ways with a fully revived Frieza and return to their \\"normal\\" lives on Earth.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (, Gojؐta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[53] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[54] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[55] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[57] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[58] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[59] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[60] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[61] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoku has been the subject of, and is mentioned in, various songs. \\"Son Goku Song\\"[63] and \\"Gok no Gokigen Jnؐ\\"[64] feature Goku as a child singing about himself. During his adult years, the song \\"Aitsu wa Son Gok\\" by Hironobu Kageyama, where Kageyama praises everything about Goku,[65] and the duet \\"Ore-tachi no Energy\\"[66] feature words spoken by the character. For the release of the single of the Dragonball Evolution international theme song \\"Rule\\", Toriyama supplied CD artwork of singer Ayumi Hamasaki dressed as Goku.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoku has been used in Japanese public service announcements aimed at children. In June 1988, Goku and other Dragon Ball characters were featured in two PSA short films. The first, in which Goku is taught the importance of obeying traffic safety by others, is entitled The Goku Traffic Safety (iZo??, Gok no Kts Anzen).[68] The second is called The Goku Fire Fighting Regiment (iZm?, Gok no Shb-tai), in which he teaches two children the importance of fire safety.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\n Goku has made guest appearances in various Japanese television shows and manga. In 2005, Goku appeared in the Toriyama parody manga Neko Majin Z where he is the sensei of the main character Z.[69] On September 15, 2006, in celebration of the 30th anniversary of Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Ken-mae Hashutsujo, the special manga Super Kochikame (]?w, Ch Kochikame) was released. The chapter entitled This is the Police Station in front of Dragon Park on Planet Namek (չρGx´?@r̈~, Kochira Namekku-sei Dragon Ken-mae Hashutsujo) has Ryotsu Kankichi travel to planet Namek and try to issue Freeza a citation and scold he and Goku for parking their ships illegally.[70] Goku and other Dragon Ball characters join the cast of One Piece in the 2006 crossover manga Cross Epoch.[71] He also appears in a single panel of Toriyama's 2013 manga Jaco the Galactic Patrolman, which is set before the events of Dragon Ball.[72] The collected tankbon volume of Jaco features the bonus story Dragon Ball Minus: The Departure of the Fated Child, depicting how and why Goku's father and mother, Gine (), sent him to Earth.[73][74]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoku has been the subject of various parodies. In the episode Career Day of Takeshi's Castle, known in the United States as MXC, the hosts Beat Takeshi and Sonomanma Higashi dressed as popular anime characters, one as Goku as a child, the other as Doraemon.[75] Weekly Shnen Jump's Gag Special 2005 issue, released on November 12, 2004, featured a Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo one-shot Dragon Ball parody manga, a retelling of the first fight between Goku and Vegeta.[76] In chapter #179 of the Yakitate!! Japan manga, Kawachi executes a Genki-Dama parody called a Shinrai-Dama (|Lޔ, lit. \\"Trust Ball\\") on the character Katsuo.[77]  In the manga and anime series Blood Lad, the character Staz performs the gestures for Goku's Kamehameha, having learned it from his favorite manga superhero, but it has no actual effect.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoku regularly appears on Fuji TV. In 2003, Goku appeared in the interactive feature Kyutai Panic Adventure! (⼫ʧì!, Kytai Panikku Adobench!, \\"Orb Panic Adventure!\\"), which was featured exclusively at the Fuji TV headquarters in the Kyutai (orb) section. In this, Freeza attacks a visiting tourist, blasting the orb section free from the rest of the Fuji TV building. Goku fights Freeza over the real life aqua city of Odaiba.[79][80] In 2004, a sequel called Kytai Panic Adventure Returns! (⼫ʧìμX!, Kytai Panikku Adobench Ritnzu!, \\"Orb Panic Adventure Returns!\\") was produced.[81] On March 25, 2006, Goku and Freeza appeared in an original animated short film in the IQ Mirror Mistake 7 (?\`лШ, Aiky Mir Machigai Nana) segment of the Japanese game show IQ Supplement (IQ, IQ Sapuri).[82] On April 7, 2007, Goku and Fuji TV announcer Masaharu Miyake were commentators on the anime segment in the Nippon Ijin Taish (?Y?~p, \\"Japan Great Man Awards\\") titled Saiky no Ijin ha Dare? (I???slA, \\"Who is the Strongest Hero?\\"). The segment featured a special tournament to decide who was the greatest person in Japanese history. During the intermission, Goku promoted the coming release of R2 Dragon Ball DVDs.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the U.S. debut of Dragon Ball Z in 1996, Goku has appeared in American pop culture. He was featured in an issue of Wizard magazine in which he and Superman fought a hypothetical battle and won.[84] In the Codename: Kids Next Door episode \\"Operation: R.E.P.O.R.T\\", Numbuh Four's version of the story is a parody of the Goku and Freeza's battle in Dragon Ball Z.[85] Goku appears in Robot Chicken in a sketch entitled A Very Dragon Ball Z Christmas, where Goku and Gohan fight an evil Mrs. Claus with Santa's reindeer, in an attempt to save Christmas.[86] The Saturday Night Live sketch TV Funhouse titled Kobayashi depicts real-life hot-dog-eating champion Takeru Kobayashi as able to transform into a Super Saiyan as he prepares to eat hot dogs; Goku appears briefly near the end.[87] Goku is referenced in the songs \\"Goku\\" and \\"Anime\\" by Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, where he brags that he looks and feels like Goku.[88] Goku appears in a parody of the film Moneyball on an episode of Mad entitled Money Ball Z, in which Billy Beane drafts Goku and a couple of other Dragon Ball characters into the Oakland A's.[89] In 2013, he and Superman fought in a \\"Death Battle\\" episode of the Rooster Teeth web series ScrewAttack.[90] The episode \\"Goku vs. Superman\\" in the web series Epic Rap Battles of History[91] won a Streamy Award for Best Music Video.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of the Kamehameha attack became an Internet meme which started with Japanese schoolgirls photographing themselves apparently using, and being affected by, this attack.[93][94] It has also attracted considerable media attention in France,[95] Germany,[96] as well as in many Spanish-speaking countries in South America.[97][98][99]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoku's character has been well received by publications for manga, anime and other media. Anime News Network noted Goku as a good source of comedy and remarked that after everything he experiences, he still remains a na?ve character.[100] Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews noted that Goku is not an omnipotent character in the first anime series, unlike Dragon Ball Z, and does not disappear for long periods of time between sagas. They also liked the way the series' depict his entire adventures, making him a good main character.[101] Rationalmagic.com praised Goku's innocence as one of the funniest parts of the series.[102] According to Julius Weideman, Goku's journey and ever-growing strength resulted in the character winning \\"the admiration of young boys everywhere.\\"[103] In 2015, the Japan Anniversary Association officially declared May 9 as \\"Goku Day\\" (iZ??, Gok no hi). In Japanese the numbers 5 and 9 can be pronounced as \\"Go\\" and \\"Ku\\" respectively.[104] Jason Thompson stated that unlike the \\"manly\\" heroes of other popular shnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as City Hunter and Fist of the North Star, Toriyama made his protagonist (Goku) cartoonish and small, thus starting a trend that Thompson says continues to this day.[105] One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda and Naruto creator Masashi Kishimoto said that Goku inspired their protagonists as well as series structure.[106][107] Commenting on Goku's popularity, Kishimoto stated that when people hear the name \\"Son Goku\\", no longer do they think of the Journey to the West character, but instead Dragon Ball's protagonist comes to mind.[108] Additionally, for the second half of the series, Kishimoto created an ape named Son Goku in reference to Toriyama's character to the point the ape has four tails just like the four-star Dragon Ball Goku earned from his grandfather.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nMasako Nozawa, the Japanese voice actor who plays Goku in the Japanese dubs, said that she liked young Goku with his tail because he was cute, and stated that the character was still the same even at the end of the series.[110] Jackie Chan has gone on record stating that Goku is his favorite Dragon Ball character.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoku was ranked number one in IGN's 2009 Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time[112] and reappeared on the same list in 2014, however, on this occasion they ranked him third, with Cowboy Bebop's Spike Spiegel and Neon Genesis Evangelion's Shinji Ikari placed above him, saying that \\"He was, in many ways, a character that bucked the trends of his time and defined the direction of shonen manga/anime for decades.\\"[113] In Mania Entertainment's 10 Most Iconic Anime Heroes, Thomas Zoth commented that \\"Goku and Dragon Ball completely revolutionized shnen manga.\\"[114] In a Newtype poll from March 2010, Goku was voted the fifth most popular male character from the 1980s.[115] Goku ranked consistently high in the Anime Grand Prix poll in the category of \\"best male character\\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s, appearing seventeenth in the 1987 poll,[116] fifteenth in the 1988 poll,[117] second in the 1989 poll,[118] fourth in the 1990 poll,[119] third in the 1991 poll,[120] fourth in the 1992 poll,[121] thirteenth in 1993 poll,[122] and twelfth in 1994 poll.[123] In a 1993 character popularity poll for the series, Weekly Shnen Jump readers voted Goku second, after his son Gohan.[124] He came in first in the magazine's 1995 poll,[124] as well as in a 2004 poll amongst fans of the series for the book Dragon Ball Forever.[125] In a 2005 The Daily Reader article entitled \\"The Greatest Geek Movie Heroes of All Time\\", Goku is the only animated character listed, and is ranked tenth.[126] In a survey of 1,000 people, conducted by Oricon in 2007, Goku ranked first place as the \\"Strongest Manga character of all time.\\"[127] In the survey \\"Friendship\\" developed by rankingjapan.com, in which people chose which anime character they would like as a friend, Goku ranked fifth.[128] In 2000, Goku placed third in an Animax poll of favorite anime characters.[129] NTT customers voted him as their third favorite black haired male anime character.[130] Despite his positive reception, Goku also received negative feedback for his characterization in Dragon Ball Super due to how his constant desires for fighting stronger enemies resulted in setting up a story where all universe could be destroyed. While Anime Now's Richard Eisenbeis believes Goku is determined to protect his universe, the fact that he does not care about other loser universes being destroyed also received negative response.[131] In January 2017, Nowaza won two Guinness World Records for her longevity as Goku; she has been the sole voice actor for the role for over 23 years.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral pieces of merchandising based on Goku have been released, including action figures,[133][134] plushes,[135] and keychains.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German rock band Son Goku takes their name from the Dragon Ball protagonist. The band's lead singer Thomas D chose the name because Goku embodies the band's philosophy, saying he was \\"fascinated by Goku's na?vet and cheerfulness, yet, at the same time, a great warrior saving the world.\\"[137] In 2010, a fiberglass statue of Goku was created by Chinese artist Edison Chen, with Chen's facial features instead of Goku's, as part of Chen's \\"I Hate You For Looking!\\" collection that was displayed at the \\"Treacherous Treis\\" exhibition.[138] CNN released an article explaining how Goku was Rafael Nadal's childhood inspiration, and called Nadal \\"the Dragon Ball of tennis\\" due to his unorthodox style \\"from another planet.\\"[139]","input":"Who was the first saiyan to fight goku?"},{"output":"in southern Oregon","context":"Crater Lake National Park is a United States National Park located in southern Oregon. Established in 1902, Crater Lake National Park is the fifth-oldest national park in the U.S. and the only national park in Oregon.[3] The park encompasses the caldera of Crater Lake, a remnant of a destroyed volcano, Mount Mazama, and the surrounding hills and forests.\\r\\nThe lake is 1,949 feet (594?m) deep at its deepest point,[4] which makes it the deepest lake in the United States, the second-deepest in North America and the ninth-deepest in the world.[4] Crater Lake is often referred to as the seventh-deepest lake in the world, but this former listing excludes the approximately 3,000-foot (910?m) depth of subglacial Lake Vostok in Antarctica, which resides under nearly 13,000 feet (4,000?m) of ice, and the recent report of a 2,740-foot (840?m) maximum depth for Lake O'Higgins/San Martin, located on the border of Chile and Argentina. However, when comparing its average depth of 1,148 feet (350?m) to the average depth of other deep lakes, Crater Lake becomes the deepest in the Western Hemisphere and the third-deepest in the world. The impressive average depth of this volcanic lake is due to the nearly symmetrical 4,000-foot-deep (1,200?m) caldera formed 7,700 years ago during the violent climactic eruptions and subsequent collapse of Mount Mazama and the relatively moist climate that is typical of the crest of the Cascade Range.\\r\\nThe caldera rim ranges in elevation from 7,000 to 8,000 feet (2,100 to 2,400?m). The United States Geological Survey benchmarked elevation of the lake surface itself is 6,178 feet (1,883?m). This National Park encompasses 183,224 acres (74,148?ha; 286.29?sq?mi).[1] Crater Lake has no streams flowing into or out of it. All water that enters the lake is eventually lost from evaporation or subsurface seepage. The lake's water commonly has a striking blue hue, and the lake is re-filled entirely from direct precipitation in the form of snow and rain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVolcanic activity in this area is fed by subduction off the coast of Oregon as the Juan de Fuca Plate slips below the North American Plate (see plate tectonics). Heat and compression generated by this movement has created a mountain chain topped by a series of volcanoes, which together are called the Cascade Range. The large volcanoes in the range are called the High Cascades. However, there are many other volcanoes in the range as well, most of which are much smaller.\\r\\nAbout 400,000 years ago, Mount Mazama began its existence in much the same way as the other mountains of the High Cascades, as overlapping shield volcanoes. Over time, alternating layers of lava flows and pyroclastic flows built Mazama's overlapping cones until it reached about 11,000 feet (3,400?m) in height.\\r\\nAs the young stratovolcano grew, many smaller volcanoes and volcanic vents were built in the area of the park and just outside what are now the park's borders. Chief among these were cinder cones. Although the early examples are gonecinder cones erode easilythere are at least 13 much younger cinder cones in the park, and at least another 11 or so outside its borders, that still retain their distinctive cinder cone appearance. There continues to be debate as to whether these minor volcanoes and vents were parasitic to Mazama's magma chamber and system or if they were related to background Oregon Cascade volcanism.\\r\\nAfter a period of dormancy, Mazama became active again. Then, around 5700 BC, Mazama collapsed into itself during a tremendous volcanic eruption, losing 2,500 to 3,500 feet (760 to 1,070?m) in height. The eruption formed a large caldera that, depending on the prevailing climate, was filled in about 740 years, forming a beautiful lake with a deep blue hue, known today as Crater Lake.[5]\\r\\nThe eruptive period that decapitated Mazama also laid waste to much of the greater Crater Lake area and deposited ash as far east as the northwest corner of what is now Yellowstone National Park, as far south as central Nevada, and as far north as southern British Columbia. It produced more than 150 times as much ash as the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.\\r\\nThis ash has since developed a soil type called andisol. Soils in Crater Lake National Park are brown, dark brown or dark grayish-brown sandy loams or loamy sands which have plentiful cobbles, gravel and stones. They are slightly to moderately acidic and their drainage is somewhat excessive.\\r\\nSnow is relatively rare at low elevations in western Oregon, but it is common at higher elevations, especially at Crater Lake. Measurements at park headquarters, 6,475 feet (1,974?m) above sea level, show that snow falls more often here than at any other long-term weather station in Oregon. Winter, which typically begins at the park in September and runs through June, includes an average of 98 days with measurable snowfall. Up to 37 inches (94?cm) of snow have fallen on the park in a single day (in 1937, 1951, and 1971), 313 inches (800?cm) in a month (January 1950), and 903 inches (2,290?cm) in a year (1950).[6]\\r\\nSnow typically accumulates in the park to depths of 10 to 15 feet (3.0 to 4.6?m) by early spring. Most of the park's roads remain closed through late spring, and snow lingers into the summer. In July and August, snowfall is uncommon, and \\"one magnificent day typically follows another\\".[7]\\r\\nJanuary is the coldest month, when highs average about 35?F (2?C) and lows average about 18?F (?8?C).[8] August is the warmest month, with an average high of roughly 69?F (21?C) and an average low of about 40?F (4?C).[8] Between 1962 and 1990, the highest recorded temperature was 90?F (32?C), and the lowest was ?21?F (?29?C).[9] Annual precipitation averages about 66 inches (1,700?mm) a year.[10] December is the wettest, averaging about 11 inches (280?mm).[10]\\r\\nAlthough snow covers Crater Lake National Park for eight months of the year (average annual snowfall is 533 inches (1,350?cm)), the lake rarely freezes over due in part to a relatively mild onshore flow from the Pacific Ocean. The last recorded year in which the lake froze over was in 1949, a very long, cold winter. A 95% surface freeze occurred in 1985. The immense depth of Crater Lake acts as a heat reservoir that absorbs and traps sunlight, maintaining the lake temperature at an average of 55?F (13?C) on the surface and 38?F (3?C) at the bottom throughout the year. The surface temperature fluctuates a bit, but the bottom temperature remains quite constant.\\r\\nMammals that are residents of this national park are Canadian lynxes, bobcats, beavers, chipmunks, pikas, foxes, cougars, squirrels, porcupines, black bears, coyotes, timber wolves, badgers, deer, elk, muskrats, and martens. Birds that commonly fly through this park including raptors are American dippers, Peregrine falcons, ravens, Clark's nutcrackers, gray jays, bald eagles, hummingbirds and spotted owls while Canada geese float on its lake.\\r\\nSome notable park features created by this huge eruption are:\\r\\nLocal Native Americans witnessed the collapse of Mount Mazama and kept the event alive in their legends. One ancient legend of the Klamath people closely parallels the geologic story which emerges from today's scientific research. The legend tells of two Chiefs, Llao of the Below World and Skell of the Above World, pitted in a battle which ended up in the destruction of Llao's home, Mt. Mazama.[14] The battle was witnessed in the eruption of Mt. Mazama and the creation of Crater Lake.\\r\\nA trio of gold prospectors: John Wesley Hillman, Henry Klippel, and Isaac Skeeters were the first white people to visit the lake. On June 12, 1853, they stumbled upon the long, sloping mountain while hunting for provisions. Stunned by vibrant blue color of the lake, they named the indigo body of water \\"Deep Blue Lake\\" and the place on the southwest side of the rim where he first saw the lake later became known as Discovery Point.[3] But gold was more on the minds of settlers at the time and the discovery was soon forgotten. The suggested name later fell out of favor by locals, who preferred the name Crater Lake.\\r\\nWilliam Gladstone Steel devoted his life and fortune to the establishment and management of a national park at Crater Lake. His preoccupation with the lake began in 1870. In his efforts to bring recognition to the park, he participated in lake surveys that provided scientific support. He named many of the lake's landmarks, including Wizard Island, Llao Rock, and Skell Head.\\r\\nWith the help of geologist Clarence Dutton, Steel organized a USGS expedition to study the lake in 1886. The party carried the Cleetwood, a half-ton survey boat, up the steep slopes of the mountain then lowered it to the lake. From the stern of the Cleetwood, a piece of pipe on the end of a spool of piano wire sounded the depth of the lake at 168 different points. Their deepest sounding, 1,996 feet (608?m), was very close to the modern official depth of 1,949 feet (594?m) made in 2000 by sonar.[4] At the same time, a topographer surveyed the area and created the first professional map of the Crater Lake area.\\r\\nPartly based on data from the expedition and lobbying from Steel and others, Crater Lake National Park was established May 22, 1902 by President Theodore Roosevelt. And because of Steel's involvement, Crater Lake Lodge was opened in 1915 and the Rim Drive was completed in 1918.[3]\\r\\nHighways were later built to the park to help facilitate tourism. The 1929 edition of O Ranger! described access and facilities available by then:\\r\\nCrater Lake National Park is reached by train on the Southern Pacific Railroad lines into Medford and Klamath Falls, at which stops motor stages make the short trip to the park. A hotel on the rim of the lake offers accommodations. For the motorist, the visit to the park is a short side trip from the Pacific and Dalles-California highways. He will find, in addition to the hotel, campsites, stores, filling stations. The park is open to travel from late June or July 1 for as long as snow does not block the roads, generally until October.[15]\\r\\nThe lake is described in the poetry of Joaquin Miller.[16]\\r\\nThere are many hiking trails and several campgrounds inside the park. Unlicensed fishing is allowed without any limitation of size, species, or number. The lake is believed to have no indigenous fish, but several species of fish were introduced beginning in 1888 until all fish stocking ended in 1941. Kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) now thrive and reproduce here naturally.[17] Swimming is allowed in the lake, and the boat tours, which stop at Wizard Island, a cinder cone inside the lake, operate daily during the summer. All lake access for people is from Cleetwood Trail, a steep walking trail, and there are no roads for cars, trucks, or wagons that lead to the waterfront. All of the boats in the lake were delivered by helicopter.[18]\\r\\nNumerous observation points along the caldera rim for the lake are readily accessible by automobile via the \\"Rim Drive\\", which is 33 miles (53?km) long and has an elevation gain of 3,800 feet (1,200?m).\\r\\nThe highest point in Crater Lake National Park is Mount Scott at 8,929 feet (2,722?m). Getting there requires a fairly steep 2.5-mile (4.0?km) hike from the Rim Drive trailhead. On a clear day, visibility from the summit exceeds 100 miles (160?km), and one can, in a single view, take in the entire caldera. Also visible from this point are the white-peaked Cascade Range volcanoes to the north, the Columbia River Plateau to the east, and the Western Cascades and the more-distant Klamath Mountains to the west.\\r\\nThe scenery of Crater Lake is fully accessible during the summer months. Heavy snowfalls in this park during the fall, winter, and spring months force many road and trail closures, including the popular \\"Rim Drive\\", which is generally completely open from July to October and partially open in some other months, such as May, June, and November.\\r\\nThe Cleetwood Cove trail originates on the north side of the lake about 4.5?mi (7.2?km) east of North Junction along East Rim Drive. The trail is the only one that accesses the shoreline of the lake, descending 656 feet (200?m) from the Cleetwood Cove parking lot. First opened during the summer of 1960, the trail is 1.1?mi (1.8?km) long with an 11% grade that rates it as a strenuous route on the return trip. Due to its steep grade, the trail is not accessible for mobility-impaired visitors. A dock with concessionaire boats facilitates tours around the lake with a stop at Wizard Island for dropping off and picking up passengers. Swimming and fishing are permitted. Snow may cover the trail from October to July with some variance depending on yearly snowfall conditions.[19]\\r\\nThe Watchman Peak trail begins from the Watchman Overlook parking lot, about 3.8?mi (6.1?km) northwest of Rim Village.[20] The trail is 0.8?mi (1.3?km) long with a 420-foot (130?m) elevation change.[21] It is a steady uphill trail on an isolated mountain on the west rim of the crater, with several switchbacks, providing wide views of Crater Lake and Wizard Island. Several nearby landmarks are visible from the summit, including Mount McLoughlin, Mount Thielsen, Union Peak, Mount Scott and the Klamath Basin. The trail ends next to a historic fire lookout tower built in 1932.[20]\\r\\nThe Lightning Spring trail starts from the Lightning Spring picnic area. It is a 3?4-mile (1.2?km) hike with an elevation gain of 250 feet (76?m). The trail circles around several meadows up to the Lightning Spring creek. The trail is known for the frequent sights of grazing deer.\\r\\nThis is considered to be the easiest trail, looping around the Castle Crest Wildflower Garden. It starts from the East Rim Road, near the park's headquarters. It received its name because of a large stretch of meadows around which the trail circles and which is bursting with wildflowers in the springtime. The trail is about 1?2 mile (800?m) before it reaches the wildflower meadow garden, from which other improvised routes depart.\\r\\nThe Plaikni Falls trail is the newest trail on the Crater Lake park. It stretches 1.1 miles (1.8?km) from the trailhead located 1.2 miles (1.9?km) south from the Phantom Ship Overlook on Pinnacles Road, which spins off Rim Drive. The trail leads to Plaikni Falls. Most of the trail is wheelchair-accessible. The final stretch is fairly uphill, which may prove moderately challenging.\\r\\nThe Garfield Peak trail is a moderately challenging 1.7-mile (2.7?km) hike to Garfield Peak. The trailhead is located east of the Crater Lake Lodge and gains approximately 1,000 feet (300?m) of elevation. Several spots along the trail provide viewpoints overlooking the Phantom Ship island and Dutton Cliff. A few viewpoints offer unique views of Wizard island. The trail is popular in the late afternoon on account of unique shifting colors over the lake and its surroundings.","input":"Where is the crater lake national park located?"},{"output":"United States","context":"Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics was the first appearance of the sport as an official medal event.

Founded in 1847, and formerly self-styled as the \\"World's Greatest Newspaper\\" (for which WGN radio and television are named), it remains the most-read daily newspaper of the Chicago metropolitan area and the Great Lakes region. It is the eighth-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation (and became the second-largest under Tribune's ownership after the Chicago Tribune's parent company purchased the Los Angeles Times).[2]\\r\\nTraditionally published as a broadsheet, on January 13, 2009, the Tribune announced it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery, but would publish in tabloid format for newsstand, news box, and commuter station sales.[3] This change, however, proved to be unpopular with readers and in August 2011, the Tribune discontinued the tabloid edition, returning to its traditional broadsheet edition through all distribution channels.[4]\\r\\nThe Tribune's masthead is notable for displaying the American flag, in reference to the paper's motto, \\"An American Paper for Americans.\\" The motto is no longer displayed on the masthead, where it was placed below the flag.\\r\\nAs of 2018[update], Chicago Tribune and LA Times took down in most European countries due to GDPR,[5] despite having had two years to prepare for it[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tribune was founded by James Kelly, John E. Wheeler, and Joseph K. C. Forrest, publishing the first edition on June 10, 1847. Numerous changes in ownership and editorship took place over the next eight years. Initially, the Tribune was not politically affiliated, but tended to support either the Whig or Free Soil parties against the Democrats in elections.[7] By late 1853, it was frequently running xenophobic editorials that criticized foreigners and Roman Catholics.[8] About this time it also became a strong proponent of temperance.[9] However nativist its editorials may have been, it was not until February 10, 1855 that the Tribune formally affiliated itself with the nativist American or Know Nothing party, whose candidate Levi Boone was elected Mayor of Chicago the following month.[10]\\r\\nBy about 1854, part-owner Capt. J. D. Webster, later General Webster and chief of staff at the Battle of Shiloh, and Dr. Charles H. Ray of Galena, Illinois, through Horace Greeley, convinced Joseph Medill of Cleveland's Leader to become managing editor. Ray became editor-in-chief, Medill became the managing editor, and Alfred Cowles, Sr., brother of Edwin Cowles, initially was the bookkeeper. Each purchased one third of the Tribune.[11][12] Under their leadership, the Tribune distanced itself from the Know Nothings, and became the main Chicago organ of the Republican Party.[13] However, the paper continued to print anti-Catholic and anti-Irish editorials, in the wake of the massive Famine immigration from Ireland.[14]\\r\\nThe Tribune absorbed three other Chicago publications under the new editors: the Free West in 1855, the Democratic Press of William Bross in 1858, and the Chicago Democrat in 1861, whose editor, John Wentworth, left his position when elected as Mayor of Chicago. Between 1858 and 1860, the paper was known as the Chicago Press & Tribune. On October 25, 1860, it became the Chicago Daily Tribune.[15] Before and during the American Civil War, the new editors strongly supported Abraham Lincoln, whom Medill helped secure the presidency in 1860, and pushed an abolitionist agenda. The paper remained a force in Republican politics for years afterwards.\\r\\nIn 1861, the Tribune published new lyrics by William W. Patton for the song \\"John Brown's Body\\". These rivaled the lyrics published two months later by Julia Ward Howe. Medill served as mayor of Chicago for one term after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.\\r\\nUnder the 20th-century editorship of Colonel Robert R. McCormick, who took control in the 1920s, the paper was strongly isolationist and aligned with the Old Right in its coverage of political news and social trends. It used the motto \\"The American Paper for Americans\\". Through the 1930s to the 1950s, it excoriated the Democrats and the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt, was resolutely disdainful of the British and French, and greatly enthusiastic for Chiang Kai-shek and Sen. Joseph McCarthy.\\r\\nWhen McCormick assumed the position of co-editor (with his cousin Joseph Medill Patterson) in 1910, the Tribune was the third-best-selling paper among Chicago's eight dailies, with a circulation of only 188,000.[16] The young cousins added features such as advice columns and homegrown comic strips such as Little Orphan Annie and Moon Mullins. They promoted political \\"crusades\\", with their first success coming with the ouster of the Republican political boss of Illinois, Sen. William Lorimer.[16] At the same time, the Tribune competed with the Hearst paper, the Chicago Examiner, in a circulation war. By 1914, the cousins succeeded in forcing out Managing Editor William Keeley. By 1918, the Examiner was forced to merge with the Chicago Herald.\\r\\nIn 1919, Patterson left the Tribune and moved to New York to launch his own newspaper, the New York Daily News.[16] In a renewed circulation war with Hearst's Herald-Examiner, McCormick and Hearst ran rival lotteries in 1922. The Tribune won the battle, adding 250,000 readers to its ranks. Also in 1922, the Chicago Tribune hosted an international design competition for its new headquarters, the Tribune Tower. The competition worked brilliantly as a publicity stunt, and more than 260 entries were received. The winner was a neo-Gothic design by New York architects John Mead Howells and Raymond Hood.\\r\\nThe newspaper sponsored a pioneering attempt at Arctic aviation in 1929, an attempted round-trip to Europe across Greenland and Iceland in a Sikorsky amphibious aircraft.[17] But, the aircraft was destroyed by ice on July 15, 1929, near Ungava Bay at the tip of Labrador, Canada. The crew were rescued by the Canadian science ship CSS Acadia.[18]\\r\\nThe Tribune's reputation for innovation extended to radioit bought an early station, WDAP, in 1924 and renamed it WGN (AM), the station call letters standing for the paper's self-description as the \\"World's Greatest Newspaper'. WGN Television was launched April 5, 1948. These broadcast stations remain Tribune properties to this day and are among the oldest newspaper/broadcasting cross-ownerships in the country. (The Tribune's East Coast sibling, the New York Daily News, later established WPIX television and radio.)\\r\\nThe Tribune's legendary sports editor Arch Ward created the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1933 as part of the city's Century of Progress exposition.\\r\\nFrom 1940 to 1943 the paper supplemented its comic strip offerings with The Chicago Tribune Comic Book, responding to the new success of comic books. At the same time, it launched the more successful and longer lasting The Spirit Section, which was also an attempt by newspapers to compete with the new medium.[19]\\r\\nDuring the McCormick years, the Tribune was a champion of modified spelling for simplicity (such as spelling \\"although\\" as \\"altho\\").[20][21] McCormick, a vigorous campaigner for the Republican Party, died in 1955, just four days before Democratic boss Richard J. Daley was elected mayor for the first time.\\r\\nOne of the great scoops in Tribune history came when it obtained the text of the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919. Another was its revelation of United States war plans on the eve of the Pearl Harbor attack. The Tribune's June 7, 1942, front page announcement that the United States had broken Japan's naval code was the revelation by the paper of a closely guarded military secret.[22] The story revealing that Americans broke the enemy naval codes was not cleared by censors, and had US President Franklin D. Roosevelt so enraged that he considered shutting down the Tribune.[23][24][25][26]\\r\\nThe paper is well known for a mistake it made during the 1948 presidential election. At that time, much of its composing room staff was on strike. The early returns led editors to believe (along with many in the country) that the Republican candidate Thomas Dewey would win. An early edition of the next day's paper carried the headline \\"Dewey Defeats Truman\\", turning the paper into a collector's item. Democrat Harry S. Truman won and proudly brandished the newspaper in a famous picture taken at St. Louis Union Station. Beneath the headline was a false article, written by Arthur Sears Henning, which purported to describe West Coast results although written before East Coast election returns were available.\\r\\nColonel McCormick prevented the Tribune for years from participating in the Pulitzer Prize competition. But it has won 25 of the awards over the years, including many for editorial writing.[27][28][29] The Tribune won its first post-McCormick Pulitzer in 1961, when Carey Orr won the award for editorial cartooning. Reporter George Bliss won a Pulitzer the following year for reporting, and reporter Bill Jones another in 1971 for reporting.[27] A reporting team won the award in 1973, followed by reporter William Mullen and photographer Ovie Carter, who won a Pulitzer for international reporting in 1975. A local reporting team won the award in 1976, and architecture critic Paul Gapp won a Pulitzer in 1979.[27]\\r\\nIn 1969, under the leadership of publisher Harold Grumhaus and editor Clayton Kirkpatrick (1915ÿ2004), the Tribune's began reporting from a wider viewpoint. The paper retained its Republican and conservative perspective in its editorials, but it began to publish perspectives in wider commentary that represented a spectrum of diverse opinions, while its news reporting no longer had the conservative slant it had in the McCormick years.\\r\\nIn early 1974, in a major feat of journalism, the Tribune published the complete 246,000-word text of the Watergate tapes, in a 44-page supplement that hit the streets 24?hours after the transcripts' release by the Nixon White House. Not only was the Tribune the first newspaper to publish the transcripts, but it beat the US Government Printing Office's published version, and made headlines doing so.[clarification needed]\\r\\nA week later, after studying the transcripts, the paper's editorial board observed that \\"the high dedication to grand principles that Americans have a right to expect from a President is missing from the transcript record.\\" The Tribune's editors concluded that \\"nobody of sound mind can read [the transcripts] and continue to think that Mr. Nixon has upheld the standards and dignity of the Presidency,\\" and called for Nixon's resignation. The Tribune call for Nixon to resign made news, reflecting not only the change in the type of conservatism practiced by the paper, but as a watershed event in terms of Nixon's hopes for survival in office. The White House reportedly perceived the Tribune's editorial as a loss of a long-time supporter and as a blow to Nixon's hopes to weather the scandal.\\r\\nOn December 7, 1975, Kirkpatrick announced in a column on the editorial page that Rick Soll, a \\"young and talented columnist\\" for the paper, whose work had \\"won a following among many Tribune readers over the last two years\\", had resigned from the paper. He had acknowledged that a November 23, 1975 column he wrote contained verbatim passages written by another columnist in 1967 and later published in a collection. Kirkpatrick did not identify the columnist. The passages in question, Kirkpatrick wrote, were from a notebook where Soll regularly entered words, phrases and bits of conversation which he had wished to remember. The paper initially suspended Soll for a month without pay. Kirkpatrick wrote that further evidence was revealed came out that another of Soll's columns contained information which he knew was false. At that point, Tribune editors decided to accept the resignation offered by Soll when the internal investigation began.[30]\\r\\nAfter leaving, Soll married Pam Zekman, a Chicago newspaper (and future TV) reporter. He worked for the short-lived Chicago Times magazine in the late 1980s.\\r\\nIn January 1977, Tribune columnist Will Leonard died at age 64.[31]\\r\\nIn March 1978, the Tribune announced that it hired columnist Bob Greene from the Chicago Sun-Times.[32]\\r\\nKirkpatrick stepped down as editor in 1979 and was succeeded by Maxwell McCrohon (1928ÿ2004), who served as editor until 1981. He was transitioned to a corporate position. McCrohon held the corporate position until 1983, when he left to become editor-in-chief of the United Press International. James Squires served as the paper's editor from July 1981 until December 1989.\\r\\nJack Fuller served as the Tribune's editor from 1989 until 1993, when he became the president and chief executive officer of the Chicago Tribune. Howard Tyner served as the Tribune's editor from 1993 until 2001, when he was promoted to vice president/editorial for Tribune Publishing.\\r\\nThe Tribune won 11 Pulitzer prizes during the 1980s and 1990s.[27] Editorial cartoonist Dick Locher won the award in 1983, and editorial cartoonist Jeff MacNelly won one in 1985. Then, future editor Jack Fuller won a Pulitzer for editorial writing in 1986. In 1987, reporters Jeff Lyon and Peter Gorner won a Pulitzer for explanatory reporting, and in 1988, Dean Baquet, William Gaines and Ann Marie Lipinski won a Pulitzer for investigative reporting. In 1989, Lois Wille won a Pulitzer for editorial writing and Clarence Page snagged the award for commentary. In 1994, Ron Kotulak won a Pulitzer for explanatory journalism, while R. Bruce Dold won it for editorial writing. In 1998, reporter Paul Salopek won a Pulitzer for explanatory writing, and in 1999, architecture critic Blair Kamin won it for criticism.[27]\\r\\nIn September 1981, baseball writer Jerome Holtzman was hired by the Tribune after a 38-year career at the Sun-Times.\\r\\nIn November 1982, Tribune managing editor William H. \\"Bill\\" Jones, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1971, died at age 43 of cardiac arrest as a result of complications from a long battle with leukemia.[33]\\r\\nIn May 1983, Tribune columnist Aaron Gold died at age 45 of complications from leukemia.[34] Gold had coauthored the Tribune's \\"Inc.\\" column with Michael Sneed and prior to that had written the paper's \\"Tower Ticker\\" column.\\r\\nThe Tribune scored a coup in 1984 when it hired popular columnist Mike Royko away from the rival Sun-Times.[35]\\r\\nIn 1986, the Tribune announced that celebrated film critic Gene Siskel, the Tribune's best-known writer, was no longer the paper's film critic, and that his position with the paper had shifted from being that of a full-time film critic to that of a freelance contract writer who was to write about the film industry for the Sunday paper and also provide capsule film reviews for the paper's entertainment sections. The demotion occurred after Siskel and longtime Chicago film critic colleague Roger Ebert decided to shift the production of their weekly movie-review showthen known as At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert and later known as Siskel & Ebert & The Moviesfrom Tribune Entertainment to The Walt Disney Company's Buena Vista Television unit. \\"He has done a great job for us,\\" editor James Squires said at the time. \\"It's a question of how much a person can do physically. We think you need to be a newspaper person first, and Gene Siskel has always tried to do that. But there comes a point when a career is so big that you can't do that.\\" Siskel declined to comment on the new arrangement, but Ebert publicly criticized Siskel's Tribune bosses for punishing Siskel for taking their television program to a company other than Tribune Entertainment.[36] Siskel remained in that freelance position until his death in 1999. He was replaced as film critic by Dave Kehr.[37]\\r\\nIn February 1988, Tribune foreign correspondent Jonathan Broder resigned after a February 22, 1988 Tribune article written by Broder contained a number of sentences and phrases taken, without attribution, from a column written by another writer, Joel Greenberg, that had been published 10 days earlier in the Jerusalem Post.[38][39]\\r\\nIn August 1988, Chicago Tribune reporter Michael Coakley died at age 41 of complications from AIDS.[40]\\r\\nIn November 1992, Tribune associate subject editor Searle \\"Ed\\" Hawley was arrested by Chicago police and charged with seven counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse for allegedly having sex with three juveniles in his home in Evanston, Illinois.[41] Hawley formally resigned from the paper in early 1993, and pleaded guilty in April 1993. He was sentenced to 3?years in prison.[42]\\r\\nIn an unusual move at that time, the Tribune in October 1993 fired its longtime military-affairs writer, retired-Marine David Evans, with the public position that the post of military affairs was being dropped in favor of having a national security writer.[43]\\r\\nIn December 1993, the Tribune's longtime Washington, D.C. bureau chief, Nicholas Horrock, was removed from his post after he chose not to attend a meeting that editor Howard Tyner requested of him in Chicago.[44] Horrock, who shortly thereafter left the paper, was replaced by James Warren, who attracted new attention to the Tribune's D.C. bureau through his continued attacks on celebrity broadcast journalists in Washington.\\r\\nAlso in December 1993, the Tribune hired Margaret Holt from the South Florida Sun-Sentinel as its assistant managing editor for sports, making her the first female to head a sports department at any of the nation's 10 largest newspapers.[45] In mid-1995, Holt was replaced as sports editor by Tim Franklin and shifted to a newly created job, customer service editor.[46]\\r\\nIn 1994, reporter Brenda You was fired by the Tribune after free-lancing for supermarket tabloid newspapers and lending them photographs from the Tribune's photo library.[32] You later worked for the National Enquirer and as a producer for The Jerry Springer Show before committing suicide in November 2005.[47]\\r\\nIn April 1994, the Tribune's new television critic, Ken Parish Perkins, wrote an article about then-WFLD morning news anchor Bob Sirott in which Perkins quoted Sirott as making a statement that Sirott later denied making. Sirott criticized Perkins on the air, and the Tribune later printed a correction acknowledging that Sirott had never made that statement.[48] Eight months later, Perkins stepped down as TV critic, and he left the paper shortly thereafter.[49]\\r\\nIn December 1995, the alternative newsweekly Newcity published a first-person article by the pseudonymous Clara Hamon (a name mentioned in the play The Front Page) but quickly identified by Tribune reporters as that of former Tribune reporter Mary Hill that heavily criticized the paper's one-year residency program. The program brought young journalists in and out of the paper for one-year stints, seldom resulting in a full-time job. Hill, who wrote for the paper from 1992 until 1993, acknowledged to the Chicago Reader that she had written the diatribe originally for the Internet, and that the piece eventually was edited for Newcity.[50]\\r\\nIn 1997, the Tribune celebrated its 150th anniversary in part by tapping longtime reporter Stevenson Swanson to edit the book Chicago Days: 150 Defining Moments in the Life of a Great City.\\r\\nOn April 29, 1997, popular columnist Mike Royko died of a brain aneurysm. On September 2, 1997, the Tribune promoted longtime City Hall reporter John Kass to take Royko's place as the paper's principal Page Two news columnist.[51]\\r\\nOn June 1, 1997, the Tribune published what ended up becoming a very popular column by Mary Schmich called \\"Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young\\", otherwise known as \\"Wear Sunscreen\\" or the \\"Sunscreen Speech.\\" The most popular and well-known form of the essay is the successful music single released in 1999, accredited to Baz Luhrmann.\\r\\nIn 1998, reporter Jerry Thomas was fired by the Tribune after he wrote a cover article on boxing promoter Don King for Emerge magazine at the same time that he was writing a cover article on King for the Chicago Tribune Sunday magazine. The paper decided to fire Thomasand suspend his photographer on the Emerge story, Pulitzer Prize-winning Tribune photographer Ovie Carter for a monthbecause Thomas did not tell the Tribune about his outside work and also because the Emerge story wound up appearing in print first.[52]\\r\\nOn June 6, 1999, the Tribune published a first-person travel article from freelance writer Gaby Plattner that described a supposed incident in which a pilot for Air Zimbabwe who was flying without a copilot inadvertently locked himself out of his cockpit while the plane was flying on autopilot and as a result needed to use a large ax to chop a hole in the cockpit door.[53] An airline representative wrote a lengthy letter to the paper calling the account \\"totally untrue, unprofessional and damaging to our airline\\" and explaining that Air Zimbabwe does not keep axes on its aircraft and never flies without a full crew,[54] and the paper was forced to print a correction stating that Plattner \\"now says that she passed along a story she had heard as something she had experienced.\\"[53]\\r\\nThe Tribune has been a leader on the Internet, acquiring 10 percent of America Online in the early 1990s, then launching such web sites as Chicagotribune.com (1995), Metromix.com (1996), ChicagoSports.com (1999), ChicagoBreakingNews.com (2008), and ChicagoNow.com (2009). In 2002, the paper launched a tabloid edition targeted at 18- to 34-year-olds known as RedEye.\\r\\nAnn Marie Lipinski was the paper's editor from February 2001 until stepping down on July 17, 2008. Gerould W. Kern was named the paper's editor in July 2008.[55] In early August 2008, managing editor for news Hanke Gratteau resigned, and several weeks later, managing editor for features James Warren resigned as well.[56] Both were replaced by Jane Hirt, who previously had been the editor of the Tribune's RedEye tabloid.[56]\\r\\nIn June 2000, Times Mirror merged with Tribune Company making The Baltimore Sun and its community papers Baltimore Sun Media Group / Patuxent Publishing a subsidiary of Tribune.[57][58]\\r\\nIn July 2000, Tribune outdoors columnist John Husar, who had written about his need for a new liver transplant, died at age 63 just over a week after receiving part of a new liver from a live donor.[59]\\r\\nTribune's Baltimore Community papers include Arbutus Times, Baltimore Messenger, Catonsville Times, Columbia Flier, Howard County Times, The Jeffersonian, Laurel Leader, Lifetimes, North County News, Northeast Booster, Northeast Reporter, Owings Mills Times, and Towson Times.\\r\\nThe Howard County Times was named 2010 Newspaper of the Year by the Suburban Newspaper Association.[60]\\r\\nThe Towson Times expands coverage beyond the Towson area and includes Baltimore County government and politics.[61][62]\\r\\nThe Tribune won five Pulitzer prizes in the first decade of the 21st century.[27] Salopek won his second Pulitzer for the Tribune in 2001 for international reporting, and that same year an explanatory reporting teamlead writers of which were Louise Kiernan, Jon Hilkevitch, Laurie Cohen, Robert Manor, Andrew Martin, John Schmeltzer, Alex Rodriguez and Andrew Zajacwon the honor for a profile of the chaotic U.S. air traffic system.[27][63] In 2003, editorial writer Cornelia Grumman snagged the award for editorial writing.[27] In 2005, Julia Keller won a Pulitzer for feature reporting on a tornado that struck Utica, Illinois.[27] And, in 2008, an investigative reporting team including Patricia Callahan, Maurice Possley, Sam Roe, Ted Gregory, Michael Oneal, Evan Osnos and photojournalist Scott Strazzante won the Pulitzer for its series about faulty government regulation of defective toys, cribs and car seats.[27][64]\\r\\nIn late 2001, sports columnist Michael Holley announced he was leaving the Tribune after just two months because he was homesick.[65] He ultimately returned to the Boston Globe, where he had been working immediately before the Tribune had hired him.[65]\\r\\nOn September 15, 2002, Lipinski wrote a terse, page-one note informing readers that the paper's longtime columnist, Bob Greene, resigned effective immediately after acknowledging \\"engaging in inappropriate sexual conduct some years ago with a girl in her late teens whom he met in connection with his newspaper column.\\" The conduct later was revealed to have occurred in 1988 with a woman who was of the age of consent in Illinois. \\"Greene's behavior was a serious violation of Tribune ethics and standards for its journalists,\\" Lipinski wrote. \\"We deeply regret the conduct, its effect on the young woman and the impact this disclosure has on the trust our readers placed in Greene and this newspaper.\\"[66][67]\\r\\nIn January 2003, Mike Downey, formerly of the Los Angeles Times, was hired as new Tribune sports columnist. He and colleague Rick Morrissey would write the In the Wake of the News Column originated by Ring Lardner.\\r\\nIn March 2004, the Tribune announced that freelance reporter Uli Schmetzer, who retired from the Tribune in 2002 after 16?years as a foreign correspondent, had fabricated the name and occupation of a person he had quoted in a story. The paper terminated Schmetzer as a contract reporter and began a review of the 300 stories that Schmetzer had written over the prior three years.[68]\\r\\nIn May 2004, the Tribune revealed that freelance reporter Mark Falanga was unable to verify some facts that he inserted in a lifestyle-related column that ran on April 18, 2004, about an expensive lunch at a Chicago restaurantnamely, that the restaurant charged $15 for a bottle of water and $35 for a pasta entree. \\"Upon questioning, the freelance writer indicated the column was based on an amalgam of three restaurants and could not verify the prices,\\" the paper noted.[69][70] After the correction, the Tribune stopped using Falanga.\\r\\nIn October 2004, Tribune editor Ann Marie Lipinski at the last minute spiked a story written for the paper's WomanNews section by freelance reporter Lisa Bertagnoli titled \\"You c_nt say that (or can you?),\\" about a noted vulgarism.[71] The paper ordered every spare body to go to the Tribune's printing plant to pull already-printed WomanNews sections containing the story from the Wednesday, October 27, 2004, package of preprinted sections in the Tribune.[71]\\r\\nIn September 2008, the Tribune considered hiring controversial sports columnist Jay Mariotti, shortly after his abrupt resignation from Tribune archrival Chicago Sun-Times.[72] Discussions ultimately ended, however, after the Sun-Times threatened to sue for violating Mariotti's noncompete agreement, which was to run until August 2009.[72] Sports columnist Rick Morrissey defected to the Sun-Times in December 2009.\\r\\nIn April 2009, 55 Tribune reporters and editors signed their names to an e-mail sent to Kern and managing editor Jane Hirt, questioning why the newspaper's marketing department had solicited subscribers' opinions on stories before they were published, and suggesting that the practice raised ethical questions as well as legal and competitive issues. Reporters declined to speak on the record to the Associated Press about their issues. \\"We'll let the e-mail speak for itself,\\" reporter John Chase told the AP. In the wake of the controversy, Kern abruptly discontinued the effort, which he described as \\"a brief market research project.\\"[73]\\r\\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the Tribune had multiple rounds of reductions of staff through layoffs and buyouts as it has coped with the industrywide declines in advertising revenues:\\r\\nThe Tribune broke the story on Friday, May 29, 2009, that several students had been admitted to the University of Illinois based upon connections or recommendations by the school's Board of Trustees, Chicago politicians, and members of the Rod Blagojevich administration. Initially denying the existence of a so-called \\"Category I\\" admissions program, university President B. Joseph \\"Joe\\" White and Chancellor Richard Herman later admitted that there were instances of preferential treatment. Although they claimed the list was short and their role was minor, the Tribune, in particular, revealed emails through a FOIA finding that White had received a recommendation for a relative of convicted fundraiser Tony Rezko to be admitted. The Tribune also later posted emails from Herman pushing for underqualified students to be accepted.[88][89] The Tribune has since filed suit against the university administration under the Freedom of Information Act to acquire the names of students benefited by administrative clout and impropriety.\\r\\nOn February 8, 2010, the Chicago Tribune shrank its newspaper's width by an inch. They said that the new format was becoming the industry standard and that there would be minimal content changes.\\r\\nIn July 2011, the Chicago Tribune underwent its first round of layoffs of editorial employees in more than two years, letting go about 20 editors and reporters.[90] Among those let go were DuPage County reporter Art Barnum, Editorial Board member Pat Widder and photographer Dave Pierini.[90][91]\\r\\nOn March 15, 2012, the Tribune laid off 15 editorial staffers, including security guard Wendell Smothers (Smothers then died on November 12, 2012).[92][93] At the same time, the paper gave buyouts to six editorial staffers, including Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter William Mullen, Barbara Mahany and Nancy Reese.[94]\\r\\nIn June 2012, the Tribune's Pulitzer Prize-winning cultural critic Julia Keller left the paper to join the faculty of Ohio University and to pursue a career as a novelist.[95]\\r\\nIn September 2012, Tribune education reporter Joel Hood resigned from the paper to become a real estate broker and City Hall reporter Kristen Mack left the paper to become press secretary for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle.[96]\\r\\nIn September 2012, the Tribune hired Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer John J. Kim from the Chicago Sun-Times.[97]\\r\\nIn October 2012, the Tribune's science and medicine reporter, Trine Tsouderos, quit to join a public relations firm.[98]\\r\\nAlso in October 2012, the Tribune announced plans to create a pay wall for its website, offering digital-only subscriptions at $14.99 per month, starting on November 1, 2012. Seven-day print subscribers would continue to have unlimited online access at no additional charge.[99]\\r\\nIn late February 2013, the Tribune agreed to pay a total of $660,000 to settle a class-action lawsuit that had been filed against the paper by 46 current and former reporters of its TribLocal local-news reporting group over unpaid overtime wages.[100] The suit had been filed in federal court on behalf of Carolyn Rusin, who had been a TribLocal staff reporter from July 2010 until October 2011.[100] The paper's TribLocal unit had been formed in 2007 and uses staff reporters, freelance writers and user-generated content to produce hyperlocal Chicago-area community news.[100]\\r\\nOn June 12, 2013, the Boston Marathon bombings moving tribute was posted again, which showed the words \\"We are Chicago\\" above the names of Boston sports teams.[101] On the graphic on June 12, the word \\"Bruins\\" was ripped off and the comment was added, \\"Yeah, not right now we're not\\", in a reference to the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals, which play the Chicago Blackhawks against the Boston Bruins.[101] Gerould Kern tweeted later that the Tribune \\"still supports [Boston] after all you've been through. We regret any offense. Now let's play hockey.\\"[101]\\r\\nOn November 20, 2013, the Tribune laid off another 12 or so editorial staffers.[102]\\r\\nOn April 6, 2014, the Tribune increased the newsstand price of its Sunday/Thanksgiving Day paper by 50 percent to $2.99 for a single copy. The newsrack price increased $0.75, or 42.9%, to $2.50.[103] By January 2017 the price increased again, up $1 or 40% at newsracks, to $3.50. At newsstands it went up also $1, or 33.3%, to $3.99.\\r\\nOn January 28, 2015, metropolitan editor Peter Kendall was named managing editor, replacing Jane Hirt, who had resigned several months earlier. Colin McMahon was named associate editor.[104]\\r\\nOn February 18, 2016, the Tribune announced the retirement of editor Gerould Kern and the immediate promotion of the paper's editorial page editor, R. Bruce Dold, to be the Tribune's editor.[38]\\r\\nIn a 2007 statement of principles published in the Tribune's print and online editions, the paper's editorial board described the newspaper's philosophy, from which is excerpted the following:\\r\\nThe Tribune has remained economically conservative, being widely skeptical of increasing the minimum wage and entitlement spending. Although the Tribune criticized the Bush administration's record on civil liberties, the environment, and many aspects of its foreign policy, it continued to support his presidency while taking Democrats, such as Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and Cook County Board President Todd Stroger, to task and calling for their removal from office.\\r\\nIn 2004, the Tribune endorsed President George W. Bush for re-election, a decision consistent with its longstanding support for the Republican Party. In 2008, it endorsed Democratic candidate and Illinois junior U.S. Senator Barack Obamathe first time that it had ever endorsed a Democrat for president.[105] The Tribune endorsed Obama once again for reelection in 2012.[106]\\r\\nThe Tribune has previously backed independent candidates. In 1872, it supported Horace Greeley, a former Republican Party newspaper editor,[107] and in 1912 the paper endorsed Theodore Roosevelt, who ran on the Progressive Party slate against Republican President William Howard Taft.\\r\\nOver the years, the Tribune has endorsed Democrats for lesser offices, including recent endorsements of Bill Foster, Barack Obama for the Senate and Democrat Melissa Bean, who defeated Philip Crane, the House of Representatives' longest-serving Republican. Though the Tribune endorsed George Ryan in the 1998 Illinois gubernatorial race, the paper subsequently investigated and reported on the scandals surrounding Ryan during his preceding years as Secretary of State. Ryan declined to run for re-election in 2002 and was subsequently indicted, convicted and imprisoned as a result of the scandal.\\r\\nIn 2016, the Tribune endorsed the Libertarian Party candidate, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson for president, over Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton.[108]\\r\\nThe Chicago Tribune is the founding business unit of Tribune Company (since renamed Tribune Media Company), which included many newspapers and television stations around the country. In Chicago, Tribune Media owns the WGN radio station (720?AM) and WGN-TV (Channel 9). Tribune Company also owned the Los Angeles Timeswhich displaced the Tribune as the company's largest propertyand the Chicago Cubs baseball team. The Cubs were sold in 2009, the newspapers spun off in 2014.\\r\\nTribune Company owned the New York Daily News from its 1919 founding until its 1991 sale to British newspaper magnate Robert Maxwell. The founder of the News, Capt. Joseph Medill Patterson, was a grandson of Joseph Medill and a cousin of Tribune editor Robert McCormick. Both Patterson and McCormick were enthusiasts of simplified spelling, another hallmark of their papers for many years. In 2008, the Tribune Company sold the Long Island newspaper Newsdayfounded in 1940 by Patterson's daughter (and Medill's great-granddaughter), Alicia Pattersonto Long Island cable TV company Cablevision.\\r\\nSince 1925, the Chicago Tribune has been housed in the Tribune Tower on North Michigan Avenue on the Magnificent Mile. The building is neo-Gothic in style, and the design was the winner of an international competition hosted by the Tribune. The Tribune Tower is owned by Tribune Media. Tribune Tower once housed the physical storefront of the Chicago Tribune Store, but more recently the store has switched to an online presence.[109]\\r\\nThe September 2008 redesign (discussed here[110] on the Tribune's web site) was controversial and is largely regarded as an effort in cost-cutting.[111] Since then the newspaper has returned to a more toned down style. The style is more a mix of the old style and a new modern style.\\r\\nIn December 2007, the Tribune Company was bought out by Chicago real estate magnate Sam Zell in an $8.2?billion deal. Zell was the company's new chairman.[112] A year after going private, following a $124?million third-quarter loss, the Tribune Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 8, 2008. The company made its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, citing a debt of $13?billion and assets of $7.6?billion.[113]\\r\\nAs part of its bankruptcy plan, owner Sam Zell intended to sell the Cubs to reduce debt. This sale has become linked to the corruption charges leading to the December 9, 2008, arrest of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. Specifically, the ex-governor was accused of exploiting the paper's financial trouble in an effort to have several editors fired.[114]\\r\\nIn the bankruptcy, unsecured bondholders of Tribune Co. essentially claimed that ordinary Tribune shareholders participated in a \\"fraudulent transfer\\" of wealth.[115]\\r\\nThe law firm Brown Rudnick, representing the Aurelius group of junior creditors, filed fraudulent transfer claims and fraud claims against 33,000 to 35,000 stockholders who bought Tribune stock.[116] Prolonged due to these claims against former officers, directors, and every former stockholder of the Chicago Tribune Company,[116][117] the Tribune's bankruptcy-related legal and professional fees of $500?million were more than twice the usual amount for that size of company.[118]\\r\\nThe Tribune Co. emerged from bankruptcy in January 2013, partially owned by private equity firms which had speculated on its distressed debt. The reorganized company's plan included selling off many of its assets.[118]\\r\\nTribune Publishing, owning the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, and eight other newspapers, was spun off as a separate publicly traded company in August 2014. The parent Tribune Company was renamed Tribune Media Company.[119] Tribune Publishing started life with a $350 million loan, $275 million of which was paid as a dividend to Tribune Media. The publishing company was also due to lease its office space from Tribune Media for $30 million per year through 2017.[119][120]\\r\\nSpinning off Tribune Publishing avoided the capital gains taxes that would accrue from selling those assets. The shares in Tribune Publishing were given tax-free to stakeholders in Tribune Media, the largest shareholder was Oaktree Capital Management with 18.5%.[120] Tribune Media, retaining the non-newspaper broadcasting, entertainment, real estate, and other investments, also sold off some of the non-newspaper properties.[119]\\r\\nThe Tribune prices are: $1.50 or $1.99/Daily, $3.50 or $3.99/Sunday/Thanksgiving Day. The Tribune on weekdays was $1.50 until early 2017, the current newsrack price, when it was raised to $1.99. Price is higher outside Cook & adjacent counties.[121] Articles from The Tribune are also available for purchase a la carte on Outlit.[122]\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\n3\\r\\n4\\r\\n5\\r\\n6\\r\\n7\\r\\nNBC\\r\\nWall Street Journal\\r\\nAgence France-Presse\\r\\nMSNBC\\r\\nBloomberg BNA\\r\\nWashington Examiner\\r\\nTRNS/Univision\\r\\nFox News\\r\\nCBS Radio\\r\\nAP Radio\\r\\nForeign Pool\\r\\nTime\\r\\nYahoo!

Euskal Herria is the oldest documented Basque name for the area they inhabit, dating from the 16th century.[2]\\r\\nIt comprises the Autonomous Communities of the Basque Country and Navarre in Spain and the Northern Basque Country in France. The region is home to the Basque people (Basque: Euskaldunak), their language (Basque: Euskara), culture and traditions. The area is neither linguistically nor culturally homogeneous, and certain areas have a majority of people who do not consider themselves Basque, such as the south of Navarre.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name in Basque is Euskal Herria. The name is difficult to accurately translate into other languages due to the wide range of meanings of the Basque word herri. It can be translated as nation; country, land; people, population and town, village, settlement.[4] The first part, Euskal, is the adjectival form of Euskara \\"the Basque language\\".[4] Thus a more literal translation would be \\"country/nation/people/settlement of the Basque language\\", a concept difficult to render into a single word in most other languages.\\r\\nThe two earliest references (in various spelling guises) are in Joan Perez de Lazarraga's manuscript, dated around 1564ÿ1567 as eusquel erria and eusquel erriau and heuscal herrian ('in the Basque Country') and Heuscal-Herrian in Joanes Leizarraga's Bible translation, published in 1571.[5]\\r\\nThe term Basque Country refers to a collection of regions inhabited by the Basque people, known as Euskal Herria in Basque language, and it is first attested as including seven traditional territories in Axular's literary work Gero (he goes on to suggest that Basque language is spoken \\"in many other places\\"), in the early 17th century. Some Basques refer to the seven traditional districts collectively as Zazpiak Bat, meaning \\"The Seven [are] One\\", a motto coined in the late 19th century.\\r\\nThe Northern Basque Country, known in Basque as Iparralde (literally, \\"the northern part\\") is the part of the Basque Country that lies entirely within France, specifically as part of the Pyrnes-Atlantiques dpartment of France, and as such it is also usually known as French Basque Country (Pays basque fran?ais in French). In most contemporary sources it covers the arrondissement of Bayonne and the cantons of Maulon-Licharre and Tardets-Sorholus, but sources disagree on the status of the village of Esquiule.[6] Within these conventions, the area of Northern Basque Country (including the 29 square kilometres (11 square miles) of Esquiule) is 2,995 square kilometres (1,156 square miles).[7]\\r\\nThe French Basque Country is traditionally subdivided into three provinces:\\r\\nHowever, this summary presentation makes it hard to justify the inclusion of a few communes in the lower Adour region. As emphasized by Jean Goyhenetche, it would be more accurate to depict it as the reunion of five entities: Labourd, Lower Navarre, Soule but also Bayonne and Gramont.[8]\\r\\nThe Southern Basque Country, known in Basque as Hegoalde (literally, \\"the southern part\\") is the part of the Basque region that lies completely within Spain, and as such it is frequently also known as Spanish Basque Country (Pas Vasco espa?ol in Spanish). It is the largest and most populated part of the Basque Country. It includes two main regions: the Basque Autonomous Community (Vitoria-Gasteiz as capital) and the Chartered Community of Navarre (capital city Pamplona).\\r\\nThe Basque Autonomous Community (7,234?km2)[9] consists of three provinces, specifically designated \\"historical territories\\":\\r\\nThe Chartered Community of Navarre (10,391?km2)[9] is a single-province autonomous community. Its name refers to the charters, the Fueros of Navarre. The Spanish Constitution of 1978 states that Navarre may become a part of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country if it is so decided by its people and institutions (the Disposicion transitoria cuarta or \\"Fourth Transitory Provision\\"). To date, there has been no implementation of this law. Despite demands for a referendum by minority leftist forces and Basque nationalists in Navarre, it has been opposed by mainstream Spanish parties and Navarrese People's Union; the ruling party up until 2015. The latter has repeatedly asked for an amendment to the Constitution to remove this clause.[10]\\r\\nIn addition to those, two enclaves located outside of the respective autonomous community are often cited as being part of both the Basque Autonomous Community and also the greater Basque Country:[11]\\r\\nThe Basque Country region is dominated by a warm, humid and wet oceanic climate and the coastal area is part of Green Spain and by extension it affects Bayonne and Biarritz as well. Inland areas in Navarre and the southern regions of the autonomous community are transitional with continental mediterranean climate with somewhat larger temperature swings between seasons. The list only sources locations in Spain, but Bayonne/Biarritz have a very similar climate as nearby Hondarribia on the Spanish side of the border. The values does not include San Sebastin since its weather station is at a higher elevation than the urban core where temperatures are higher year-round and similar to those in Bilbao and Hondarribia.\\r\\nAccording to some theories, Basques may be the least assimilated remnant of the Paleolithic inhabitants of Western Europe (specifically those of the Franco-Cantabrian region known as Azilian) to the Indo-European migrations. Basque tribes were mentioned by Greek writer Strabo and Roman writer Pliny, including the Vascones, the Aquitani, and others. There is considerable evidence to show their Basque ethnicity in Roman times in the form of place-names, Caesar's reference to their customs and physical make-up, the so-called Aquitanian inscriptions recording names of people and gods (approx. 1st century, see Aquitanian language), etc.\\r\\nGeographically, the Basque Country was inhabited in Roman times by several tribes: the Vascones, the Varduli, the Caristi, the Autrigones, the Berones, the Tarbelli, and the Sibulates. Some ancient place-names, such as Deba, Butr܇n, Nervi܇n, Zegama, suggest the presence of non-Basque peoples at some point in protohistory. The ancient tribes are last cited in the 5th century, after which track of them is lost, with only Vascones still being accounted for,[14]:79 while extending far beyond their former boundaries, e.g. in the current lands of lava and most conspicuously around the Pyrenees and Novempopulania.\\r\\nThe territory of the Cantabri encompassed probably present-day Biscay, Cantabria, Burgos and at least part of lava and La Rioja, i.e. to the west of Vascon territory in the Early Middle Ages,[14]:139 but the ethnic nature of this people, often at odds with and finally overcome by the Visigoths, is not certain. The Vascones around Pamplona, after much fighting against Franks and Visigoths, founded the Kingdom of Pamplona (824), inextricably linked to their kinsmen the Banu Qasi.[14]:123\\r\\nAll other tribes in the Iberian Peninsula had been, to a great extent, assimilated by Roman culture and language by the end of the Roman period or early period of the Early Middle Ages, while ethnic Basques inhabited well east into the lands of the Pyrenees (Pallars, Val d'Aran) from the 8th to the 11th century.[15]:4\\r\\nIn the Early Middle Ages (up to the 9th century) the territory between the Ebro and Garonne rivers was known as Vasconia, a blurred ethnic area and polity struggling to fend off the Frankish feudal authority from the north and the pressure of the Iberian Visigoths and Andalusi Cordovans from the south.[16]:33ÿ40\\r\\nBy the turn of the millennium, a receding Carolingian royal authority and establishing feudalism left Vasconia (to become Gascony) fragmented into myriad of counties and viscounties,[15]:207ÿ208 e.g. Fezensac, Bigorre, Astarac, Barn, Tartas, Marsan, Soule, Labourd, etc., out of former tribal systems and minor realms (County of Vasconia), while south of the Pyrenees, besides the above Kingdom of Pamplona, Gipuzkoa, lava and Biscay arose in the current lands of the Southern Basque Country from the 9th century onward.\\r\\nThese westerly territories pledged intermittent allegiance to Navarre in their early stages, but were annexed to the Kingdom of Castile at the end of the 12th century, so depriving the Kingdom of Navarre of direct access to the ocean. In the Late Middle Ages, important families dotting the whole Basque territory came to prominence, often quarreling with each other for power and unleashing the bloody War of the Bands, only stopped by royal intervention and the gradual shift of power from the countryside to the towns by the 16th century.[14]:249ÿ254 Meanwhile, the viscounties of Labourd and Soule under English suzerainty were finally incorporated to France after the Hundred Years' War, with Bayonne remaining the last Plantagenet stronghold up to 1453.\\r\\nIn Navarre, the civil wars between the Agramont and the Beaumont confederacies paved the way for the Spanish conquest of the bulk of Navarre from 1512 to 1524. The independent Navarre north of the Pyrenees was largely absorbed by France in 1620, despite the fact that King Henry III of Navarre had decreed Navarre's permanent independence from France (31 December 1596).[17]:30 In the decades after the Spanish annexation, the Basque Country went through increased religious, ideological and national homogenization,[18]:71ÿ74 encouraged by new national ideas embraced by the rising Spanish and French absolutist monarchies during the Renaissance.[19]:86, 100ÿ104\\r\\nFrom 1525, witchcraft allegations originating in a number of Pyrenean valleys on the rearguard of the Lower Navarre front and recent theatre of war (Salazar, Roncal, Burguete, etc.) were followed by the intervention of newly reformed and recent institutions, such as Spain's central tribunal Inquisition, the (Navarrese) Royal Tribunals, and the Diocesan Tribunal, who organized a series of trials for alleged witchcraft and heretical practices. In the heat of the Wars of Religion and the struggle for Navarre, persecution came to a head in the hysteria of the 1609ÿ1611 Basque witch trials on both sides of the Spanish-French border, easing afterwards.\\r\\nIn the French Basque Country, its provinces underwent an ever-shrinking self-government status until the French Revolution,[14]:267 when the traditional provinces were reshaped to form the current Basses-Pyrnes department along with Barn. In the Southern Basque Country, the regional Charters were upheld until the Carlist Wars,[14]:268 when the Basques supported heir-apparent Carlos and his descendants to the cry of \\"God, Fatherland, King\\" (The Charters were finally abolished in 1876). The ensuing centralized status quo bred dissent and frustration in the region, giving rise to Basque nationalism by the end of the 19th century, influenced by European Romantic nationalism.[14]:277\\r\\nSince then, attempts were made to find a new framework for self-empowerment. The occasion seemed to have arrived on the proclamation of the 2nd Spanish Republic in 1931, when a draft statute was drawn up for the Southern Basque Country (Statute of Estella), but was discarded in 1932. In 1936 a short-lived statute of autonomy was approved for the Gipuzkoa, lava and Biscay provinces, but war prevented any progress. After Franco's dictatorship, a new statute was designed that resulted in the creation of the current Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre, with a limited self-governing status, as settled by the Spanish Constitution. However, a significant part of Basque society is still attempting higher degrees of self-empowerment (see Basque nationalism), sometimes by acts of violence (ETA's permanent ceasefire in 2010). The French Basque Country, meanwhile, lacks any political or administrative recognition whatsoever, while a majority of local representatives have lobbied to create a Basque department, to no avail.\\r\\nThe Basque Country has a population of approximately 3 million as of early 2006. The population density, at about 140/km2 (360/sq. mile) is above average for both Spain and France, but the distribution of the population is fairly unequal, concentrated around the main cities. A third of the population is concentrated in the Greater Bilbao metropolitan area, while most of the interior of the French Basque Country and some areas of Navarre remain sparsely populated: density culminates at about 500/km2 for Biscay but falls to 20/km2 in the northern inner provinces of Lower Navarre and Soule.[21]\\r\\nA significant majority of the population of the Basque country live inside the Basque Autonomous Community (about 2,100,000, or 70% of the population) while about 600,000 live in Navarre (20% of the population) and about 300,000 (roughly 10%) in Northern Basque Country.[22]\\r\\nJos Aranda Aznar writes[23] that 30% of the population in the Basque Country Autonomous Community were born in other regions of Spain and that 40% of the people living in that territory do not have a single Basque parent.\\r\\nMost of these peoples of Galician and Castilian stock arrived in the Basque Autonomous Community in the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century, as the region became more and more industrialized and prosperous and additional workers were needed to support the economic growth. Descendants of immigrants from other parts of Spain have since been considered Basque for the most part, at least formally.[23]\\r\\nOver the last 25 years, some 380,000 people have left the Basque Autonomous Community, of which some 230,000 have moved to other parts of Spain. While certainly many of them are people returning to their original homes when starting their retirement. There is also a sizable tract of Basque natives in this group who have moved due to a Basque nationalist political environment (including ETA's killings) which they perceive as overtly hostile.[24] These have been quoted to be as high as 10% of the population in the Basque Community.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious Romani groups existed in the Basque Country and some still exist as ethnic groups. These were grouped together under the generic terms ijituak (Gypsies) and buhameak (Bohemians) by Basque speakers.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the Middle Ages, many Franks settled along the Way of Saint James in Navarre and Gipuzkoa and to a lesser extent in Bizkaia. This process also happened in Northern Castile. They were all collectively called Franks because most of them came from French regions (Normans, Bretons, Burgundians, Aquitanians etc.) but an important minority of them were in fact of German, Dutch, Italian, English and Swiss stock. Some were also from even more distant lands such as Poland or Denmark. Due to this migration, Gascon was spoken in the centre of Donostia-San Sebastin, until the beginning of the 20th century.[27] Navarre also held Jewish and Muslim minorities but these were expelled or forced to assimilate after the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. One of the outstanding members of such minorities was Benjamin of Tudela.\\r\\nMuch as has been the case for Spain's two other major economic poles (Madrid and Catalonia), the Basque Country received significant immigration from other poorer regions of Spain, due to its higher level of economic development and early industrialization. During the second half of the 20th century, such immigrants were commonly referred to by some Basques as maketos, a derogatory term which is less used today.[28] Similarly, a disdainful term, caseros, has been used by many immigrants to refer to the native population speaking in Basque.[citation needed]\\r\\nSince the 1980s, as a consequence of its considerable economic prosperity, the Basque Country has received an increasing number of immigrants, mostly from Eastern Europe, North Africa, Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and China, settling mostly in the major urban areas. Nevertheless, foreign immigrant population is surprisingly lower in the Basque country than in Madrid and Catalonia, despite having similar GDP per capita and significantly lower levels of unemployment.\\r\\nCurrently, the predominant languages in the Spanish and French Basque Countries are Spanish and French, respectively. In the historical process of forging themselves as nation-states, both the Spanish and French governments have tried more or less intensely to discourage the use of Basque and its linguistic identity.[29] The language chosen for public education is the most obvious expression of this phenomenon, something which surely had an effect in the current status of Basque.\\r\\nDespite being spoken in a relatively small territory, the rugged features of the Basque countryside and the historically high population density resulted in a heavy dialectal fragmentation throughout history, which increased the value of both Spanish and French respectively as lingua francas.[citation needed] In this regard, the current Standard form of Basque was only introduced in the late 1960s, which helped Basque move away from being perceived ÿ even by its own speakers ÿ as a language unfit for educational purposes.[30]\\r\\nWhile the French Republic has historically attempted to absorb ethnic minority groups ÿ including the French Basques ÿ into a linguistically unified state, Spain in turn has accepted intermittently in its history some degree of linguistic, cultural, and political autonomy to the Basques. Altogether there was a gradual language shift towards Spanish language in the Basque-speaking areas of the Spanish Basque Country, a phenomenon initially restricted to the upper urban classes, but progressively reaching the lower classes. Western Biscay, most of Alava and southern Navarre have been Spanish-speaking (or Romance-speaking) for centuries.\\r\\nBut under the regime of Francisco Franco, the government attempted to suppress Basque nationalism and limit the uses of the Basque language. Even the activities of the Euskaltzaindia (Basque Language Academy) were severely curtailed. In general, during these years, cultural activity in Basque was limited to folkloric issues and the Roman Catholic Church, while a higher, yet still limited degree of tolerance was granted to Basque culture and language in lava and Navarre,[citation needed] since both areas mostly supported Francoist troops during the war.\\r\\nNowadays, the Basque Autonomous Community enjoys some cultural and political autonomy and Basque is an official language along with Spanish. Basque is favoured by a set of language policies sponsored by the Basque regional government which aim at the generalization of its use. However, the actual implementation of this official status is patchy and problematic, relying ultimately on the will of the different administrative levels to enforce itJustice, Health, Administration. It is spoken by approximately a quarter of the total Basque Country, its stronghold being the contiguous area formed by Gipuzkoa, northern Navarre and the Pyrenean French valleys. It is not spoken natively in most of lava, western Biscay and the southern half of Navarre. Of a total estimation of some 650,000 Basque speakers, approximately 550,000 live in the Spanish Basque country, the rest in the French.[31]\\r\\nThe Basque education system in Spain has three types of schools differentiated by their linguistic teaching models: A, B and D. Model D, with education entirely in Basque, and Spanish as a compulsory subject, is the most widely chosen model by parents. In Navarre, there is an additional G model, with education entirely in Spanish.\\r\\nThe ruling anti-Basque conservative government of Uni܇n del Pueblo Navarro opposes Basque nationalist attempts to provide education in Basque through all Navarre (which would include areas where it is not traditionally spoken). Basque language teaching in the public education network is therefore limited to the Basque speaking north and central regions. In the central region, Basque teaching in the public education network is fairly limited, and part of the existing demand is served via private schools or ikastolak. In southern and some central areas this policy has resulted in schoolchildren having to travel sometimes for hours every day in order to attend education provided in the historic language of Navarre, largely relying on public subscription (yearly festival Nafarroa Oinez, solidarity from the ikastola network, donations, etc.) or receiving as a result no allowances for school meals. Even in northern Basque or mixed language areas, allegations raised by Basque speaker associations point regularly to a conspicuous disregard for recognised language rights, e.g. virtual non-existence of Basque language medical assistance across areas where the vast majority is Basque speaking, insufficient Basque speaking librarians,[32] no broadcasting permission in the last 20 years for the only Basque language radio in Pamplona,[33] Spanish monolingual signalization and even removal of bilingual one, etc. Spanish is or can be spoken in Navarre by the entire population, with few exceptions in remote rural areas.\\r\\nThe European Commission for Regional or Minority Languages to which Spain is signatory has issued a number of recommendations in order to guarantee a real official status for Basque language (2004), e.g. the suppression of the administrative linguistic divides of Navarre for considering it an obstacle to the normal use of Basque and discriminating against Basque speakers,[34]:76 the filing of the case against newspaper Euskaldunon Egunkaria and restitution to its normal operation,[34]:66, 79 as well as guarantees to prisoners of receiving and sending correspondence in Basque,[34]:80 to mention but a few.\\r\\nThe situation of the Basque language in the French Basque Country is vulnerable (as rated by Unesco). The pressure of French as a well-established mainstream language and different administrative obstacles to the consolidation of Basque-language schooling make the language's future prospects uncertain. On 14 June 2013, pointing to the 1850 Falloux act and declaring thereafter that French is the official language of France, the regional subprefect declared illegal the Hendaye council's subsidies to finance a new building for a Basque-language school.[35] On 6 November 2013, the Basque language school network in the French Basque Country, Seaska, bitterly criticized the French state before UNESCO for not complying with its international commitments and actually failing to accept minorities by violating their linguistic rights.[36] In November 2013, France decided not to ratify the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.\\r\\nThe earliest university in the Basque Country was the University of O?ati, founded in 1540 in Hernani and moved to O?ati in 1548. It lasted in various forms until 1901.[37] In 1868, in order to fulfill the need for college graduates for the thriving industry that was flourishing in the Bilbao area, there was an unsuccessful effort to establish a Basque-Navarrese University. Nonetheless, in 1897 the Bilbao Superior Technical School of Engineering (the first modern faculty of engineering in Spain), was founded as a way of providing engineers for the local industry; this faculty is nowadays part of the University of the Basque Country. Almost at the same time, the urgent need for business graduates led to the establishment of the Commercial Faculty by the Jesuits, and, some time thereafter, the Jesuits expanded their university by formally founding the University of Deusto in Deusto (now a Bilbao neighbourhood) by the turn of the century, a private university where the Commercial Faculty was integrated. The first modern Basque public university was the Basque University, founded 18 November 1936 by the autonomous Basque government in Bilbao in the midst of the Spanish Civil War. It operated only briefly before the government's defeat by Francisco Franco's fascist forces.[38]\\r\\nSeveral faculties, originally teaching only in Spanish, were founded in the Basque region in the Francisco Franco era. A public faculty of economics was founded in Sarriko (Bilbao) in the 1960s, and a public faculty of medicine was also founded during that decade, thus expanding the college graduate schools. However, all the public faculties in the Basque Country were organized as local branches of Spanish universities. For instance, the School of Engineering was treated as a part of the University of Valladolid, some 400 kilometres (250 miles) away from Bilbao. Indeed, the lack of a central governing body for the public faculties of the Bilbao area, namely those of Economics in Sarriko, Medicine in Basurto, Engineering in Bilbao and the School of Mining in Barakaldo (est. 1910s), was seen as a gross handicap for the cultural and economic development of the area, and so, during the late 1960s many formal requests were made to the Francoist government in order to establish a Basque public university that would unite all the public faculties already founded in Bilbao. As a result of that, the University of Bilbao was founded in the early 1970s, which has now evolved into the University of the Basque Country with campuses in the western three provinces.\\r\\nIn Navarre, Opus Dei manages the University of Navarre with another campus in San Sebastin. Additionally, there is also the Public University of Navarre, with campus in Pamplona and in Tudela, managed by the Navarrese Foral Government.\\r\\nMondrag܇n Corporaci܇n Cooperativa has established its institutions for higher education as the Mondragon University, based in Mondrag܇n and nearby towns.\\r\\nThere are numerous other significant Basque cultural institutions in the Basque Country and elsewhere. Most Basque organizations in the United States are affiliated with NABO (North American Basque Organizations, Inc.).\\r\\nSince the last quarter of the 20th century, there have been very different political views on the significance of the Basque Country, with some Basque nationalists aiming to create an independent state including the whole area, and Spanish nationalism denying the very existence of the Basque Country. The dynamics of controversial decisions imposed by Spanish tribunals on Basque nationalist parties ideologically close to ETA left for over a decade a distorted representation of the Basque politics in local councils and regional parliaments, as well as a swiftly changing array of disbanded party names, new alliances, and re-accommodations (since 1998).\\r\\nDuring the 2011 Spanish parliamentary elections, the coalition Amaiur (former Batasuna plus Eusko Alkartasuna) came up first in parliamentary seats (7) and second only to UPN-PP (5 seats) in popular vote in the Southern Basque Country, followed closely by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (5 seats). Geroa Bai secured a seat in Navarre, with the Basque Nationalist Party getting 5 (all from Basque Autonomous Community).[39]\\r\\nDespite Amaiur's results, the group was refused a parliamentary group in an unprecedented decision in the Spanish Parliament, on the grounds that the coalition's MPs represented two different constituencies. As a result, Amaiur (5th political group in the Spanish Parliament altogether)[40] remained in the Grupo Mixto with a myriad of different parties from all over Spain, while the so-called Basque Group includes only the 5 members of the PNV and the Basque Autonomous Community (Euskadi).\\r\\nHowever, in December 2015, the Spanish parliamentary elections saw the rise of Podemos (7 MPs) and the Basque Nationalist Party (6 MPs) at the expense of EH Bildu (2 MPs), while Madrid-based mainstream parties continued their steady decline trend, with the Spanish Conservatives (allied with UPN in Navarre) getting 4 MPs, and the Socialists 4 MPs.\\r\\nSince the 19th century, Basque nationalism (abertzaleak) has demanded the right of some kind of self-determination,[citation needed] which is supported by 60% of Basques in the Basque Autonomous Community, and independence, which would be supported in this same territory, according to a poll, by approximately 36%[43] of them. This desire for independence is particularly stressed among leftist Basque nationalists. The right of self-determination was asserted by the Basque Parliament in 1990, 2002 and 2006.[44]\\r\\nAccording to Article 2 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978, Article 2, \\"The Constitution is based on the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards\\". Therefore, since this precludes a declaration of independence of Spanish regions, some Basques abstained and some even voted against it in the referendum of 6 December of that year. However, it was approved by a clear majority at the Spanish level, and simple majority at Navarrese and Basque levels. The derived autonomous regimes for the BAC was approved in later referendum but the autonomy of Navarre (amejoramiento del fuero: \\"improvement of the charter\\") was never subject to referendum but just approved by the Navarrese Cortes (parliament).\\r\\nThere are not many sources on the issue for the French Basque country.\\r\\nEuskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA) is an armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization. The group was founded in 1959 and has since evolved from a group promoting traditional Basque culture to a paramilitary group with the goal of gaining independence for the Greater Basque Country.[45][46] ETA is the main organisation of the Basque National Liberation Movement and is the most important participant in the Basque conflict. ETA declared temporary ceasefires in 1989, 1996, 1998 and 2006, but subsequently came to an abrupt end. However, on 5 September 2010, ETA declared a permanent ceasefire[47] that is still in force ÿ moreover, on 20 October 2011 ETA announced a \\"definitive cessation of its armed activity\\".[48] On 2 May, 2018, the armed Basque organisation Eta issued a historic statement declaring a definitive end to its armed struggle, after six decades of political conflict.[49]\\r\\nThe Basque Country has also contributed many sportsmen, primarily in football, rugby union, cycling, jai-alai and surfing.\\r\\nThe main sport in the Basque Country, as in the rest of Spain and much of France, is football. The top teams ÿ Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad, Osasuna, Eibar, Alavs, Real Uni܇n and Barakaldo ÿ play in the Spanish football league system. Athletic Bilbao has a policy of hiring only Basque players, which has been applied with variable flexibility. Local rivals Real Sociedad used to practice the same policy, until they signed Irish striker John Aldridge in the late 1980s. Since then, Real Sociedad have had many foreign players. Athletic's policy does not apply to head coaches, with famous names as Howard Kendall and Jupp Heynckes coaching the team at various points.\\r\\nThe most renowned Basque footballer of all time is possibly Andoni Zubizarreta, who holds the record for appearances in La Liga with 622 games and won six league titles and one European Cup. Nowadays, the most well-known Basque football player is Xabi Alonso (winner of two European Championships and one FIFA World Cup) who played for Real Sociedad, Liverpool, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Other notable Basque players include Mikel Arteta, Javi Martnez, Iker Muniain, Csar Azpilicueta, Asier Illarramendi, Andoni Iraola, Aritz Aduriz and Ander Herrera. Both Athletic and Real Sociedad have won the Spanish league, including dominating the competition in the early 1980s, with the last title won by a Basque club being Athletic's 1984 title.\\r\\nAt international level, Basque players were especially prominent in Spanish selections prior to the Civil War, with all of those at the 1928 Olympics, and the majority of the 1920 Olympics and 1934 World Cup squads, born in the region.\\r\\nFootball is not that popular in the north but the region has produced two well known and successful football players, Bixente Lizarazu and Didier Deschamps of France. They were among 22 players that won the 1998 World Cup. In the 2010s, Aviron Bayonnais FC developed international players Stphane Ruffier and Kvin Rodrigues, as well as Aymeric Laporte who transferred from Athletic Bilbao to England for a fee of ?65 million.\\r\\nThe territory has an unofficial 'national' team which plays occasional friendlies, but not competitive matches against conventional national teams. Navarre has its own representative side which convenes rarely.\\r\\nCycling as a sport is popular in the Basque Country. Miguel Indurain, born in Atarrabia (Navarre), won the Tour de France five times. Fellow Basque cyclist Abraham Olano has won the Vuelta a Espa?a and the World Championship.\\r\\nA professional, UCI ProTeam cycling team hails from the Basque Country: Movistar Team[50] as well as a defunct team, EuskaltelÿEuskadi. The Movistar team traces its history back to the Banesto team that included Indurain.\\r\\nThe Euskaltel-Euskadi cycling team was commercially sponsored, but also worked as an unofficial Basque national team and was partly funded by the Basque Government. Its riders were either Basque, or at least grew up in the region's cycling culture; members of the team were sometimes strong contenders in the Tour de France held annually in July and Vuelta a Espa?a held in September. The races often saw Basque fans lining the roads wearing orange, the corporate colour of the telecoms company Euskaltel's team, coining the term the orange crush during the Pyrenees stages of the Tour de France. Team leaders included riders such as Iban Mayo, Haimar Zubeldia, Samuel Snchez and David Etxebarria.\\r\\nIn the north, rugby union is another popular sport with the Basque community. In Biarritz, the local club is Biarritz Olympique Pays Basque, the name referencing the club's Basque heritage. They wear red, white and green, and supporters wave the Basque flag in the stands. They also recognize 16 other clubs as \\"Basque-friendly\\". A number of 'home' matches played by Biarritz Olympique in the Heineken Cup have taken place at Estadio Anoeta in San Sebastian. The most famous Biarritz Basque player is the legendary French fullback Serge Blanco, whose mother was Basque. Michel Celaya captained both Biarritz and France. French number 8 Imanol Harinordoquy is also a Biarritz Basque player. Aviron Bayonnais is another top-flight rugby union club with Basque ties.\\r\\nA Basque club was the last to win the cup before the banning of rugby league, along with other professional sports, by the German collaborating Vichy regime after the defeat of France in 1940.\\r\\nPelota (jai alai) is the Basque version of the European game family that includes real tennis and squash. Basque players, playing for either the Spanish or the French teams, dominate international competitions.\\r\\nMountaineering is popular due to the mountainous terrain of the Basque Country and its proximity to the Pyrenees. Alberto I?urrategi Iriarte (Aretxabaleta, 1968) is one of the most respected mountaineers in the world. The Basque mountaineer has managed to crown the 14 eight thousands in the world, all of them \\"Alpine\\" style, i.e. without oxygen and few camps and without Sherpas. This is something only 8 people on the planet have achieved. Juanito Oiarzabal (from Vitoria) holds the world record for number of climbs above 8,000 metres (26,000 feet), with 21. There are also great sport climbers in the Basque Country, such as, Josune Bereziartu, the only female to have climbed the grade 9a/5.14d; and Iker Pou, one of the most versatile climbers in the world. Patxi Usobiaga, proclaimed world champion in Xining, China, 2009. Edurne Pasaban is already the first woman climbing the fourteen eight-thousanders.\\r\\nRelated to mountaineering is trail running, where the Basque Country plays host to the popular Zegama-Aizkorri skyrunning races, held annually since 2002.\\r\\nOne of the top basketball clubs in Europe, Saski Baskonia, is based in Vitoria-Gasteiz. Bilbao Basket and Gipuzkoa BC also play in Liga ACB, Spain's top league.\\r\\nIn recent years surfing has taken off on the Basque shores, and Mundaka and Biarritz have become spots on the world surf circuit.\\r\\nThe Basque country sporting tradition is linked to agricultural pursuits such as mowing with a scythe, or loading carts, but adapted as competitions with points awarded for specific criteria such as time, precision, elegance and productivity.\\r\\nCoordinates: 425255N 15501W? / ?42.88194N 1.91694W? / 42.88194; -1.91694","input":"What part of spain is the basque region?"},{"output":"from desalinated seawater","context":"The three cities of Abu Dhabi Emirate within the United Arab Emirates ÿ the coastal city Abu Dhabi itself (more than one million inhabitants) as well as the inland oases Al Ain (0,4 million inhabitants) and Liwa (about 0,1 million inhabitants) ÿ receive their drinking water supply entirely from desalinated seawater. Their wastewater is being treated and reused for the irrigation of green spaces.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two main sources of water in Abu Dhabi Emirate: Desalinated seawater and groundwater. While groundwater is used for agriculture in Al Ain and Liwa, drinking water is provided almost entirely from desalinated seawater across the Emirate. In 2008, groundwater contributed 71% to total water demand for all purposes, desalinated water 24% and treated wastewater 5%.[2]\\r\\nIn 2010, there were eight seawater desalination plants in Abu Dhabi owned and operated by eight joint ventures: Tawilah A, Tawilah B, the five Umm al Nar plants and the Al Mirfa plant. These joint ventures between the government and foreign companies, which are allowed to own up to 40% of the shares, are called Independent Water & Power Producers (IWPPs). They operate under Build-Own-Operate (BOO) contracts with the government and their energy is supplied by fossil fuels. In the model green city called Masdar City, four smaller pilot desalination plants that will use solar power are nearing completion as of early 2015.[3]\\r\\n90% of groundwater in Abu Dhabi Emirate is saline, in some cases up to eight times as much as seawater. There are only two freshwater aquifers. Natural groundwater recharge is estimated at about 300 million cubic meters per year. Brackish groundwater is mostly used for the irrigation of date palms which are relatively salt-tolerant. Recharge dams have been built on wadis in order to prevent flood water to flow into the sea, recharging it instead to aquifers. Unplanned and uncontrolled groundwater withdrawals, especially for agriculture and forestry, total over 2,000 million cubic meters per year and have resulted in declining groundwater levels and quality.[4]\\r\\nArtificial groundwater recharge with desalinated water has been piloted in 2003 near the Liwa Oasis and construction of large-scale recharge facilities has begun in 2008. The objective is to create a 90-day reserve instead of the current 48-hour reserve for drinking water supply, in order to protect the emirate against the risk of terrorist attacks or oil spills that would shut down the entire water supply. Recharge will occur during summer when the desalination plants generate surplus freshwater. Desalination plants in Abu Dhabi use the multi-stage flash distillation technology which uses steam from thermal power plants as an energy source. Their water production thus is proportional to electricity production and reaches a peak during the summer when electricity production is highest to power air conditioning. The recharge scheme is currently under construction and is due to be completed by 2013.[5][6]\\r\\nApproximately 550,000 cubic metres of wastewater is generated in Abu Dhabi every day and treated in 20 wastewater treatment plants.[7] Almost all of the wastewater is being reused to irrigate green spaces.[1] While most wastewater treatment plants are publicly owned and operated, four large new plants have been built by joint ventures under build-own operate transfer (BOOT) arrangements. One such contract for two plants was awarded in 2008, one in Abu Dhabi itself with a capacity of 300,000 cubic meter per day and one in Al Ain with a capacity of 130,000 cubic meter per day.[8] Contracts for two other plants were awarded to Biwater under a similar structure. A Strategic Tunnel Enhancement Programme (STEP) is to be implemented between 2008 and 2014 to establish a tunnel that will comprise 40 kilometres of deep sewerage tunnel and two new large pumping stations to relieve Abu Dhabi Island.[9]\\r\\nIn Masdar City green spaces and agriculture near the city are to be irrigated with grey water and reclaimed water.\\r\\nAbout half of the annual water production from all sources is used for irrigation of green spaces, as well as in agriculture. The other half is used for domestic uses. Freshwater use per capita is about 650 liters per day, including water supplied for the irrigation of green spaces.\\r\\nAs of 2009, in Al Ain \\"due to constraints on both the transmission and distribution networks, up to 45 percent of customers (were) on a restricted (intermittent) supply\\".[10]\\r\\nAbu Dhabi has witnessed an explosion of wealth and population since its independence in 1971 and the oil boom of 1973. Before, groundwater was the only source of water supply. It was very scarce, since there is little recharge and most of the aquifers are highly saline. It was only through seawater desalination that the growth of Abu Dhabi became possible. Seawater desalination used thermal technologies that couple desalination with power production. Water was provided free of charge. The plants were initially owned and operated by the government through the Water and Electricity Department, and financing was provided by the state from oil revenues.\\r\\nIn the mid-1990s, the government decided to reorganize the water and electricity sector. The reform was inspired by the pro-private sector and pro-competition climate reigning during the 1990s, and it was implemented through foreign advisors. The reform of both sectors was based on the principle of unbundling production, transmission and distribution:\\r\\nThe sector was to be regulated by a public agency with a certain degree of autonomy from the government. The new structure was formally adopted through law No (2) concerning the regulation of the water and electricity sector passed in 1998. The holding company ADWEA and the regulator, the Regulation and Supervision Bureau (RSB), were functionally established shortly afterwards. In 2000 the government signed the first contract for a private power and desalination plant.[7] The sanitation sector was initially left out of the reform and remained a responsibility of the municipality, despite heavy investments that were required for wastewater treatment and reuse. Only in 2005 a separate sanitation operator, Abu Dhabi Sewerage Services Company, was established.\\r\\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the protection of the environment gradually became more important in Abu Dhabi. In 2005 the Emirate created the Environment Department, which established a Strategic Water Master Plan published in 2009. When presenting the Master Plan, the chairman of the Environment Agency said that the future would be very challenging unless action was taken to reduce water consumption, which is among the highest per capita in the world.[11] The Plan describes the current status and the environmental and technical issues related to projections of demand and supply, groundwater abstraction, desalination, water supply and sanitation, irrigation, wastewater treatment and Emirati governance and institutions.[2] The government has run a media campaign to encourage people to save water. It has also distributed water-saving toilets and showerheads free of charge. The emirate also is in the process of expanding the use of reclaimed water.\\r\\nPolicy. Abu Dhabi is ruled by a Sheikh. Below him is an Executive Council taking care of day-to-day policy-making. The Council is chaired by the Crown Prince. The Chairmen of four Departments and a number of Authorities are members of the Executive Council. The government structure is not comparable to the Western structure of Ministries and separate technical authorities under those Ministries. Authorities in Abu Dhabi are rather comparable to Ministries. Water supply and sanitation in Abu Dhabi is the responsibility of the Abu Dhabi Water & Electricity Authority (ADWEA). As mentioned above, the Chairman of ADWEA is a member of the Executive Council and holds the rank of a Minister.\\r\\nThe sector is governed by two laws:\\r\\nEight private Independent Water and Power Production (IWPP) companies operate on the Build-Own-Operate (BOO) formula, producing and selling desalinated water to the Abu Dhabi Water & Electricity Company (ADWEC). ADWEC is owned by the government through ADWEA and is the single buyer of desalinated water and the single supplier of water for the distribution companies. The Abu Dhabi Transmission and Dispatch Company (TRANSCO), a public company, transports water from the desalination plants to the networks of the distribution companies. The Abu Dhabi distribution company (ADDC) sells water and electricity to approximately 216,000 customers in Abu Dhabi and its suburbs. The Al Ain distribution company does the same in Al Ain. The Abu Dhabi Sewerage Services Company is a public company in charge of sanitation.\\r\\nThe Regulation and Supervision Bureau (RSB) for the Water and Electricity Sector in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi enforces relevant laws through licensing. It is in charge both of technical regulation and price regulation.[7]\\r\\nAs of January 1, 2015, UAE citizens pay 1.7 Dirham (0.46 USD) per cubic meter of water for a very generous first block of consumption, which is set at 700 liters per day for apartments and 7,000 liters per day for villas. Above these amounts, the tariff increases slightly to 1.89 Dirham (0.51 USD) per cubic meter. Previously, water was free of charge for UAE citizens. Foreign residents and commercial users were always charged for water, starting at 5.95 Dirham (USD 1.61) per cubic meter in the lowest consumption block. The introduction of water tariffs for residents aims at reducing subsidies, encourage the efficient use of water and raise awareness of the importance of reducing consumption.[12] It was combined with a large public relations campaign, as well as advice for customers who want to save water. Even before the change in tariff, bills highlighted water usage beyond a certain level in red and showed the subsidy paid by the state.\\r\\nThe two public distribution companies receive a government subsidy. In turn, they pay a bulk supply tariff reflecting the full economic cost to ADWEC, which in turn pays for the water received from the private IWPPs under Water and Power Purchase Agreements. Bulk supply tariffs are adjusted by the RSB every four years based on maximum allowable revenues.[7]\\r\\nInvestment in desalination plants is financed by the private sector through BOO contracts. Investment in water distribution and sewerage infrastructure is financed by the government through subsidies to the respective public companies. Investment in both power and water production and distribution was more than US$36 billion from 1999 to 2008.[7] Since power and water are produced and distributed by the same companies, separate figures for investment in water infrastructure are not available.","input":"How it has been possible to supply drinking water in the uae?"},{"output":"William Coolidge","context":"An X-ray tube is a vacuum tube that converts electrical input power into X-rays.[1] X-ray tubes evolved from experimental Crookes tubes with which X-rays were first discovered on November 8, 1895, by the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad R?ntgen. The availability of this controllable source of X-rays created the field of radiography, the imaging of partly opaque objects with penetrating radiation. In contrast to other sources of ionizing radiation, X-rays are only produced as long as the X-ray tube is energized. X-ray tubes are also used in CT scanners, airport luggage scanners, X-ray crystallography, material and structure analysis, and for industrial inspection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe anode is supported on vacuum bearings and can be rotated by electromagnetic induction from a series of stator windings outside the evacuated tube. Typically, eddy currents are induced in a rotatable metal cylinder, the rotor. The superimposition of external magnetic induction and induction from the eddy currents, which changes direction with time, creates a driving mechanical momentum in the rotor.[clarification needed]\\r\\nBecause the entire anode assembly has to be contained within the evacuated tube, heat removal is a serious problem, further exacerbated by the higher power rating available. Due to the high heat generation, a matched thermal expansion of glass and the anode material is necessary. For this, high-borate borosilicate glass pioneered by Otto Schott is often used. Direct cooling by conduction or convection, as in the Coolidge tube, is difficult. In most tubes, the anode is suspended on ball bearings with silver powder lubrication which provides almost negligible cooling by conduction.\\r\\nA recent development has been liquid gallium lubricated fluid dynamic bearings which can withstand very high temperatures without contaminating the tube vacuum. The large bearing contact surface and metal lubricant provide an effective method for conduction of heat from the anode.\\r\\nThe anode must be constructed of high temperature materials. The focal spot temperature can reach 2,500?C (4,530?F) during an exposure, and the anode assembly can reach 1,000?C (1,830?F) following a series of large exposures. Typical materials are a tungsten-rhenium target on a molybdenum core, backed with graphite. The rhenium makes the tungsten more ductile and resistant to wear from the impact of the electron beams. The molybdenum conducts heat from the target. The graphite provides thermal storage for the anode, and minimizes the rotating mass of the anode.\\r\\nIncreasing demand for high-performance Computed tomography (CT) scanning and angiography systems has driven development of very high performance medical X-ray tubes. Contemporary CT tubes have power ratings of up to 100?kW and anode heat capacity of 6 MJ, yet retain an effective focal spot area of less than 1?mm2.\\r\\nSome X-ray examinations (such as, e.g., non-destructive testing and 3-D microtomography) need very high-resolution images and therefore require X-ray tubes that can generate very small focal spot sizes, typically below 50?m in diameter. These tubes are called microfocus X-ray tubes.\\r\\nThere are two basic types of microfocus X-ray tubes: solid-anode tubes and metal-jet-anode tubes.\\r\\nSolid-anode microfocus X-ray tubes are in principle very similar to the Coolidge tube, but with the important distinction that care has been taken to be able to focus the electron beam into a very small spot on the anode. Many microfocus X-ray sources operate with focus spots in the range 5-20?m, but in the extreme cases spots smaller than 1?m may be produced.\\r\\nThe major drawback of solid-anode microfocus X-ray tubes is the very low power they operate at. In order to avoid melting of the anode the electron-beam power density must be below a maximum value. This value is somewhere in the range 0.4-0.8 W/m depending on the anode material.[2] This means that a solid-anode microfocus source with a 10?m electron-beam focus can operate at a power in the range 4-8 W.\\r\\nIn metal-jet-anode microfocus X-ray tubes the solid metal anode is replaced with a jet of liquid metal, which acts as the electron-beam target. The advantage of the metal-jet anode is that the maximum electron-beam power density is significantly increased. Values in the range 3-6 W/m have been reported for different anode materials (gallium and tin).[3][4] In the case with a 10?m electron-beam focus a metal-jet-anode microfocus X-ray source may operate at 30-60 W.\\r\\nThe major benefit of the increased power density level for the metal-jet X-ray tube is the possibility to operate with a smaller focal spot, say 5?m, to increase image resolution and at the same time acquire the image faster, since the power is higher (15-30 W) than for solid-anode tubes with 10?m focal spots.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with any vacuum tube, there is a cathode, which emits electrons into the vacuum and an anode to collect the electrons, thus establishing a flow of electrical current, known as the beam, through the tube. A high voltage power source, for example 30 to 150 kilovolts (kV), called the tube voltage, is connected across cathode and anode to accelerate the electrons. The X-ray spectrum depends on the anode material and the accelerating voltage.[5]\\r\\nIn many applications, the current flow (typically in the range 1?mA to 1?A) is able to be pulsed on for between about 1?ms to 1?s. This enables consistent doses of X-rays, and taking snapshots of motion. Until the late 1980s, X-ray generators were merely high-voltage, AC to DC variable power supplies. In the late 1980s a different method of control was emerging, called high speed switching. This followed the electronics technology of switching power supplies (aka switch mode power supply), and allowed for more accurate control of the X-ray unit, higher quality results, and reduced X-ray exposures.\\r\\nElectrons from the cathode collide with the anode material, usually tungsten, molybdenum or copper, and accelerate other electrons, ions and nuclei within the anode material. About 1% of the energy generated is emitted/radiated, usually perpendicular to the path of the electron beam, as X-rays. The rest of the energy is released as heat. Over time, tungsten will be deposited from the target onto the interior surface of the tube, including the glass surface. This will slowly darken the tube and was thought to degrade the quality of the X-ray beam. Vaporized tungsten condenses on the inside of the envelope over the \\"window\\" and thus acts as an additional filter and decreases the tubes ability to radiate heat.[6] Eventually, the tungsten deposit may become sufficiently conductive that at high enough voltages, arcing occurs. The arc will jump from the cathode to the tungsten deposit, and then to the anode. This arcing causes an effect called \\"crazing\\" on the interior glass of the X-ray window. As time goes on, the tube becomes unstable even at lower voltages, and must be replaced. At this point, the tube assembly (also called the \\"tube head\\") is removed from the X-ray system, and replaced with a new tube assembly. The old tube assembly is shipped to a company that reloads it with a new X-ray tube.\\r\\nThe X-ray photon-generating effect is generally called the bremsstrahlung effect, a contraction of the German bremsen for braking, and strahlung for radiation.\\r\\nThe range of photonic energies emitted by the system can be adjusted by changing the applied voltage, and installing aluminum filters of varying thicknesses. Aluminum filters are installed in the path of the X-ray beam to remove \\"soft\\" (non-penetrating) radiation. The number of emitted X-ray photons, or dose, are adjusted by controlling the current flow and exposure time.\\r\\nThe tube current and exposure time affect the dose and therefore the contrast of the image.\\r\\nSince the introduction of scattered electron traps, directly cooled liquid metal anode bearings, rotating frame tubes and other modern technology the term has become misleading when used for the objective comparison of the performance of medical rotating anode X-ray tubes. Accordingly, the IEC 60613 standard has been revised in 2010. Anode heat storage capacity and implicitly \\"Heat Units\\" were abandoned and replaced by terms of practical relevance, e.g. NOMINAL CT ANODE INPUT POWER. Historically, heat units were referring to the amount of heat stored in a solely radiation cooled anode inside an electron reflecting glass envelope. In radiography, in particular in radiology, a heat unit was a usual unit derived from the Joule and measuring the quantity of heat in a device, in particular the thermal energy that an X-ray tube must be able to support and dissipate during and after an exam.\\r\\nHistorically, this unit comes from the need to express a quantity of energy whatever the waveform of the electrical source power (direct or pulsating). The heat produced in these devices is (in Joule)?:\\r\\nIn radiography voltage is usually expressed in \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nk\\r\\n\\r\\nV\\r\\n\\r\\np\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathrm {kV_{p}} }\\r\\n\\r\\n (thousands of volts peak), the effective current in mA and the time in seconds:\\r\\nw being the waveform ratio.

As the medical and other uses of X-rays became apparent, workshops began to manufacture specialized Crookes tubes to produce X-rays. These were the first X-ray tubes. These first generation cold cathode or Crookes X-ray tubes were used until the 1920s.\\r\\nCrookes tubes generated the electrons needed to create X-rays by ionization of the residual air in the tube, instead of a heated filament, so they were partially but not completely evacuated. They consisted of a glass bulb with around 10?6 to 5G10?8 atmospheric pressure of air (0.1 to 0.005 Pa). An aluminum cathode plate at one end of the tube created a beam of electrons, which struck a platinum anode (for economy, made from nickel or copper with a thin platinum face)[8] target at the center generating X-rays. The anode surface was angled so that the X-rays would radiate through the side of the tube. The cathode was concave so that the electrons were focused on a small (~1?mm) spot on the anode, approximating a point source of X-rays, which resulted in sharper images. The tube had a third electrode, an anticathode connected to the anode. It improved the X-ray output, but the method by which it achieved this is not understood. A more common arrangement used a copper plate anticathode (similar in construction to the cathode) in line with the anode such that the anode was between the cathode and the anticathode.\\r\\nTo operate, a DC voltage of a few kilovolts to as much as 100 kV was applied between the anodes and the cathode, usually generated by an induction coil, or for larger tubes, an electrostatic machine. This created and then accelerated a small number of ions from the low pressure gas in the tube. These struck further gas atoms, knocking electrons off them, creating more positive ions in a chain reaction. All the positive ions were attracted to the cathode. When they struck it, they knocked electrons out of the metal, which were accelerated along with the electrons knocked from the gas atoms toward the anode target. When these high speed electrons struck the atoms of the anode, they created X-rays by one of two processes, either Bremsstrahlung or X-ray fluorescence.\\r\\nCrookes tubes were unreliable. As time passed, the residual air would be absorbed by the walls of the tube, reducing the pressure. This increased the voltage across the tube, generating 'harder' X-rays, until eventually the tube stopped working. To prevent this, 'softener' devices were used (see picture). A small tube attached to the side of the main tube contained a mica sleeve or chemical that released a small amount of gas when heated, restoring the correct pressure.\\r\\nThe glass envelope of the tube would blacken in use due to the X-rays affecting its structure.\\r\\nThe Crookes tube was improved by William Coolidge in 1913.[9] The Coolidge tube, also called hot cathode tube, is the most widely used. It works with a very good quality vacuum (about 10?4 Pa, or 10?6 Torr).\\r\\nIn the Coolidge tube, the electrons are produced by thermionic effect from a tungsten filament heated by an electric current. The filament is the cathode of the tube. The high voltage potential is between the cathode and the anode, the electrons are thus accelerated, and then hit the anode.\\r\\nThere are two designs: end-window tubes and side-window tubes. End window tubes usually have \\"transmission target\\" which is thin enough to allow X-rays to pass through the target (X-rays are emitted in the same direction as the electrons are moving.) In one common type of end-window tube, the filament is around the anode (\\"annular\\" or ring-shaped), the electrons have a curved path (half of a toroid).\\r\\nWhat is special about side-window tubes is an electrostatic lens is used to focus the beam onto a very small spot on the anode. The anode is specially designed to dissipate the heat and wear resulting from this intense focused barrage of electrons. Some anodes are mechanically spun to increase the area heated by the beam (e.g. edical \\"rotating anode\\") or cooled by circulating coolant (indirectly on most rotating anodes). The anode is precisely angled at 1-20 degrees off perpendicular to the electron current so as to allow the escape of some of the X-ray photons which are emitted perpendicular to the direction of the electron current. The anode is usually made out of tungsten or molybdenum. The tube has a window designed for escape of the generated X-ray photons.\\r\\nThe power of a Coolidge tube usually ranges from 0.1 to 18 kW.\\r\\nAny vacuum tube operating at several thousand volts or more can produce X-rays as an unwanted byproduct, raising safety issues.[10][11] The higher the voltage, the more penetrating the resulting radiation and the more the hazard. CRT displays, once common in color televisions and computer displays, operate at 3-40 kilovolts,[12] making them the main concern among household appliances. Historically, concern has focused less on the cathode ray tube, since its thick glass envelope is impregnated with several pounds of lead for shielding, than on high voltage (HV) rectifier and voltage regulator tubes inside. In the late 1960s it was found that a failure in the HV supply circuit of some General Electric TVs could leave excessive voltages on the regulator tube, causing it to emit X-rays.[citation needed] The models were recalled and the ensuing scandal caused the US agency responsible for regulating this hazard, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to require that all TVs include circuits to prevent excessive voltages in the event of failure.[citation needed] The hazard associated with excessive voltages was eliminated with the advent of all solid state TVs, which have no tubes beside the CRT. Since 1969 the FDA has limited TV X-ray emission to 0.5 mR (milliroentgen) per hour. The flat screens used today do not have any vacuum tubes capable of emitting X-rays.","input":"Who invented the hot cathode x ray tube?"},{"output":"the President","context":"","input":"Who is commander chief of the us military?"},{"output":"September 1950","context":"Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) is a designation for United States military advisers sent to other countries to assist in the training of conventional armed forces and facilitate military aid. Although numerous MAAGs operated around the world throughout the 1940sÿ1970s, the most famous MAAGs were those active in Southeast Asia before and during the Vietnam War. Typically, the personnel of MAAGs were considered to be technical staff attached to, and enjoying the privileges of, the US diplomatic mission in a country.[1] Although the term is not as widespread as it once was, the functions performed by MAAGs continue to be performed by successor organizations attached to embassies, often called United States Military Groups (USMILGP or MILGRP). The term MAAG may still occasionally be used for such organizations helping promote military partnerships with several Latin American countries such as Peru and the Dominican Republic as well as in African countries such as Liberia.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1950, US President Harry Truman sent the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) to Vietnam to assist the French in the First Indochina War. The President claimed they were not sent as combat troops, but to supervise the use of $10 million worth of US military equipment to support the French in their effort to fight the Viet Minh forces. By 1953, aid increased dramatically to $350 million to replace old military equipment owned by the French.[2]\\r\\nThe French Army however, was reluctant to take U.S. advice, and would not allow the Vietnamese army to be trained to use the new equipment, because it went against French policy. They were supposed to not only defeat enemy forces but to solidify themselves as a colonial power, and they could not do this with a Vietnamese Army. French commanders were so reluctant to accept advice that would weaken their time-honored colonial role that they got in the way of the various attempts by the MAAG to observe where the equipment was being sent and how it was being used. Eventually the French decided to cooperate, but at that point it was too late.[2]\\r\\nIn 1954 the commanding general of French forces in Indochina, General Henri Navarre, allowed the United States to send liaison officers to Vietnamese forces. But it was too late, because of the siege and fall of Dien Bien Phu in the spring. As stated by the Geneva Accords, France was forced to surrender the northern half of Vietnam and to withdraw from South Vietnam by April 1956.[3]\\r\\nAt a conference in Washington, D.C. on February 12, 1955, between officials of the U.S. State Department and the French Minister of Overseas Affairs, it was agreed that all U.S. aid would be funneled directly to South Vietnam and that all major military responsibilities would be transferred from the French to the MAAG under the command of Lieutenant General John O'Daniel. A problem arose however, because the French Expeditionary Force had to depart from South Vietnam in April 1956 pursuant to the Accords. After the French defeat, it was renamed the MAAG Vietnam in 1955, as the United States became more deeply involved in what would come to be known as the Vietnam War.\\r\\nThe next few years saw the rise of a Communist insurgency in South Vietnam, and President Diem looked increasingly to US military assistance to strengthen his position, albeit with certain reservations. Attacks on US military advisers in Vietnam became more frequent. On October 22, 1957, MAAG Vietnam and USIS installations in Saigon were bombed, injuring US military advisers.[4] In the summer of 1959, Communist guerrillas staged an attack on a Vietnamese military base in Bien Hoa, killing and wounding several MAAG personnel.[5] During this time, American advisers were not put in high-ranking positions, and President Diem was reluctant to allow American advisers into Vietnamese tactical units. He was afraid that the United States would gain control or influence over his forces if Americans got into the ranks of the army. The first signs that his position was beginning to shift came in 1960, when the number of official US military advisers in the country was increased from 327 to 685 at the request of the South Vietnamese government.[5] By 1961, communist guerrillas were becoming stronger and more active. This increased enemy contacts in size and intensity throughout South Vietnam. At this point, Diem was under pressure from US authorities to liberalize his regime and implement reforms. Although key elements in the US administration were resisting his requests for increased military funding and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) troop ceilings, MAAG Vietnam played a significant role in advocating for a greater US presence in the country.[6] Throughout this period relations between the MAAG Vietnam and Diem were described as \\"excellent\\", even though the advisers were doubtful of his ability to hold off the insurgency.[7]\\r\\nNewly elected President John F. Kennedy agreed with MAAG Vietnam's calls for increases in ARVN troop levels and the U.S. military commitment in both equipment and men. In response, Kennedy provided $28.4 million in funding for ARVN, and overall military aid increased from $50 million per year to $144 million in 1961. In the first year of the Kennedy administration, MAAG Vietnam worked closely with administration officials, USOM, and the US Information Service to develop a counterinsurgency plan (CIP). The CIP's main initiatives included the strengthening of ARVN to combat the Communist insurgency, which had the corollary effect of strengthening Diem's political position.[8] At the same time President Diem agreed to the assignment of advisers to battalion level, significantly increasing the number of advisers; from 746 in 1961 to over 3,400 before MAAG Vietnam was placed under U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) and renamed the Field Advisory Element, Vietnam. At the peak of the war in 1968, 9,430 Army personnel acted as advisors down to the district and battalion level to train, advise and mentor the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps, Republic of Vietnam Navy and the Republic of Vietnam Air Force.\\r\\nMAAG Indochina had three commanders: BG Francis G. Brink, October 1950 ÿ August 1952; MG Thomas J. H. Trapnell, August 1952 ÿ April 1954; and LTG John W. O'Daniel, April 1954 ÿ November 1955. MAAG Vietnam was commanded by LTG Samuel T. Williams, November 1955 ÿ September 1960; LTG Lionel C. McGarr, September 1960 ÿ January 1962; and GEN Paul D. Harkins, January 1962 ÿ June 1964.\\r\\nAs part of the military outreach of the USA to friendly countries in Southeast Asia, a MAAG was established in Bangkok, Thailand in September 1950.\\r\\nIt was replaced by the Joint US Military Advisory Group Thailand (JUSMAGTHAI) in September 1953, which operates until today.[9][10]\\r\\nMAAG Laos was preceded by the Programs Evaluation Office, established on 15 December 1955. Due to the limitations emplaced by international treaty, the PEO was set up with civilian personnel instead of a MAAG with a military staff. When political changes superseded the treaty, MAAG Laos was established in 1961 to replace the Programs Evaluation Office in its support of the Royal Lao Army's fight against the communist Pathet Lao. On July 23, 1962, several interested countries agreed in Geneva to guarantee the neutrality and independence of Laos. As such, the US removed the MAAG, replacing it with a Requirements Office, which served as a convenient cover for the CIA activities.[11]\\r\\nOne of MAAG Laos' commanders was Reuben Tucker.\\r\\nMAAG Cambodia was established on June 4, 1955, pursuant to the United States-Royal Government of Cambodia agreement of May 16, 1955. This agreement included the introduction of high-ranking US military personnel to advise the Cambodian armed forces as non-combatants.[12] The advisory group was staffed mainly by army personnel, with smaller contingents of navy and air force personnel.\\r\\nAs Cambodia's leadership took an official policy of neutrality in the Cold War, MAAG Cambodia's involvement in the country was terminated on November 20, 1963, by General Order 6, MAAG Cambodia, following the Cambodian government's cancellation of all U.S. aid.[13]\\r\\nIn Taiwan, U.S. Military Advisory Group generally refers to the United States Armed Forces in the Republic of China (Taiwan) from April 1951 to December 1978. The commander of these forces was U.S. Major General William C. Chase until his retirement in 1955 at which time he was succeeded by U.S. Brigadier General Lester Bork[14] American military advisers were tasked with providing arms and military advice, assisting with Taiwanese military training, implementation of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, maintaining military contacts, and monitoring Republic of China forces. In 1957 there were 10,000 Americans in Taiwan, the great majority being CIA and military personnel and their families.[15]\\r\\nSince 1979, the site of MAAG headquarters in Taipei has been occupied by American Institute in Taiwan/Taipei branch, which is scheduled to move to a new office complex in 2015.\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from the United States Army Center of Military History website http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/FA54-73/ch2.htm.","input":"When were the first advisors sent to vietnam?"},{"output":"In the 1970s","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nSolo Cup Company is an American manufacturer of disposable consumer products including beverage cups, disposable plates and bowls.

The park is the largest of the three National Park Service units that comprise the North Cascades National Park Service Complex. Several national wilderness areas and British Columbia parkland adjoin the National Park. The park features rugged mountain peaks and protects portions of the North Cascades range.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman history in the region now part of North Cascades National Park dates back to the end of the last glacial period, and the region has been continuously inhabited for at least the last 8-10,000?years.[4] At that time, Native American ancestors of Skagit tribes slowly advanced from Puget Sound into the interior mountainous region as the glacial ice retreated. Archeological evidence of continuous human presence in the North Cascades dates to 4,470?B.P. and rocks procured from sources in the region were used to manufacture stone tools and weapons for several millennia.[4] Hozomeen chert, a type of rock well-suited to the fabrication of implements, was mined from near Hozomeen Mountain, just east of the park border, for the last 8,400?years. Hozomeen chert is part of the archeological record throughout the Skagit River Valley, west of the park and in regions to the east, indicating people visited the region if for no other purpose than to obtain raw materials.[5][6] Prehistoric micro blades dating back to 9,600?years before present have been discovered at Cascade Pass, a mountain pass that connects the western lowlands to the interior regions of the park and the Stehekin River Valley. The micro blades are part of an archeological assemblage that includes five distinct cultural periods, indicating that people were traveling into the mountains nearly 10,000?years ago.[7] The archeological excavation at Cascade Pass is one of the 260 prehistoric sites that have been identified in the park.[8]\\r\\nWhen white explorers first entered the area in the late 18th century, perhaps 1,000 Skagits lived there.[9] The Skagits lived in settlements, culling their needs from the waterways and traveling by way of canoe. Skagits formed a loose confederation of tribes that united if threatened by outside tribes such as the Haidas, who lived to the north.[9] They erected large houses or lodges that might house multiple families, each with their own partitioned area and entrance. The lodges were 100 feet (30?m) in length and 20 to 40?ft (6.1 to 12.2?m) in width and the roofs were shed-styles, with a single-pitch; structures built by other Puget Sound tribes usually had gable roofs with more than one-pitch.[9] The Skagits were generally lowlanders, who only ventured into the North Cascades during the summer months, and structures in the mountains were more modest, consisting mostly of temporary buildings erected with poles and covered with branches.[9] The Skagits erected totem poles and participated in potlatch ceremonies, similar to the Haidas, but with less complexity and extravagance. By 1910, only about 56 Skagits remained in the region, but their numbers have since rebounded some.[9]\\r\\nInland and residing to the north and east of the Skagits, the Nlaka'pamux (or Thompson Indians and named after explorer David Thompson), Chelan, Okanogan and Wenatchi tribes lived partly or year-round in the eastern sections of the North Cascades.[9] The Skagits and Thompsons often had disputes, and raided each other's camps in search of slaves or to exact retributions. Like the coastal based Skagits, inland tribes also constructed long lodges which were occupied by numerous families, though the style of construction was slightly different as the lodges did not have partitions separating one family from another, and were frame constructed and covered with reed mats rather than from cedar planking.[9] One Wenatchi lodge was described by Thompson as being 240?ft (73?m) long.[9] Inland tribes were more likely to travel on foot or horseback than by canoe since the inland regions were less densely forested. Inland tribes also had less bountiful fisheries and greater weather extremes due to being further away from the moderating influence of the Pacific Ocean. Additionally, inland tribes rarely erected totem poles or participated in potlatch ceremonies. By the beginning of the 20th century, inland tribes, like their coastal neighbors, had much reduced populations from when they had first encountered white explorers a hundred years earlier, mostly due to smallpox and other diseases.[9]\\r\\nThe earliest white explorer to enter the North Cascades was most likely a Scotsman named Alexander Ross in 1811, who was in the employ of the Pacific Fur Company, an American-owned company. To the southeast of the modern park boundary, Ross and other members of the company constructed Fort Okanogan in 1811, as a base to operate from during the early period of the Pacific Northwest fur trade.[10] Fort Okanogan was the first American settlement in present-day Washington, and well north of the route followed by members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804-1806, and also north of Fort Vancouver which was on the Columbia River.[11] Fort Okanogan was later owned by the North West Company and then the Hudson's Bay Company, both of which were British-owned.[11] Much of the trade in furs was conducted between Native American and a few white trappers at trading posts staffed by representatives of the fur trading company. In one season alone, Ross traded for 1500 beaver pelts.[10] In 1814, Ross became the first known white explorer to cross the major peaks of the North Cascades, but he was less interested in exploration than in simply attempting to discover a route which would easily connect the fur posts of interior Washington with Puget Sound to the west.[10][11] Ross was accompanied by three Indians, one of which was a guide, who led the party to a high pass in the North Cascades. Ross and the guide may have travelled as far west as the Skagit River, but failed to get to Puget Sound.[11] Fur trading slowed considerably as demand for furs decreased in the 1840s but a few residents continued to at least augment their income by trapping for furs in the future park until 1968 when the park was established, rendering the activity illegal.[10] Aside from isolated trappers, the North Cascades saw no explorations until the 1850s. In 1853, U.S. Army Captain George B. McClellan led a party that explored for potential places that a railroad could be built through the region; McClellan determined that the mountains were too numerous and precipitous and that any railway would have to be constructed well south of the current park.[12]\\r\\nAmerican and British disputes in the region centered on the fur trade and the Treaty of 1818 allowed for joint administration of Oregon Country, as it was referred to in the U.S. - the British Empire referred to the region as the Columbia District.[13] The treaty set the international boundary at the 49th parallel, but this was not as clear west of the Rocky Mountains, since the rival fur trading outfits had their own ideas about where the boundary should be. The Oregon boundary dispute between Britain and the U.S. eventually led to the Oregon Treaty of 1846, and the 49th parallel forms both the current international boundary as well as the northern border of the current park.[13] During the late 1850s, members of the U.S. North West Boundary Commission explored the boundary region, attempting to identify which mountains, rivers and lakes belonged to which country.[13] One party of the commission was led by explorer Henry Custer, and they explored much of the northern district of the park, publishing their report in the 1860s. Custer's party crossed Whatcom Pass in 1858 and were the first whites to see Challenger Glacier and Hozomeen Mountain.[13] So impressed with the scenic grandeur of the region, Custer succinctly stated, \\"must be seen, it cannot be described\\".[14] During the explorations by Custer, gold was discovered in a quartz vein on the slopes of Eldorado Peak.[15]\\r\\nIn 1882, U.S. Army Lt. Henry Hubbard Pierce led a government sponsored exploration that traversed along the western boundary of the southern section of the current park, in search of transportation routes and natural resources. As had been true for the party led by McClellan in the 1850s, Pierce failed to find a suitable route for a railway, and only marginally suitable routes for roads. Further expeditions by the military in 1883 and 1887 also determined that the mountains were virtually impenetrable.[12] Explorers continued to seek out routes for wagon roads and railways and by the end of the 19th century much of the park had been explored, but it wasn't until 1972 that the North Cascades Highway finally bisected the mountains.[12]\\r\\nProspectors had entered the North Cascades by the 1850s; placer mining first started along the banks of the Skagit River. In the 1870s, placer mining also commenced along Ruby Creek and hundreds of miners flocked to the region even though it was difficult to access. Most mining activity along Ruby Creek had ended by the 1880s but was soon replaced by hard rock mining for silver and other minerals.[10] This second period of mining lasted from the 1890s to the 1940s, but was only marginally more lucrative.[16] Miners were hampered by short working seasons, difficult terrain, low quantities of ore and a lack of financial investments.[17] Miners built many of the first trails and roads into portions of the backcountry, some that involved intricate engineering, including bridges over the numerous streams and dynamiting rock ledges above steep gorges during trail construction.[10][18] One mining company built a series of flumes, the longest of which was over 3 miles (4.8?km), to both transport lumber and to supply water for use in their hydraulic mining operation.[10] During the latter years of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, larger scale mining companies mined silver and lead in addition to gold, mostly for little to no profitability. The demand for various metals was not constant, so prices tended to fluctuate too much for mining to be viable.[10] Once the region became a national park, some privately owned mining inholdings remained. One such inholding, the Thunder Creek mine, was still privately owned as of 1997.[19]\\r\\nUnlike many other regions of the Pacific Northwest, logging had little major impact on the future park.[20] The ruggedness of the terrain and the existence of more economically viable timber resources which were closer to transportation routes, largely dissuaded the timber industry from logging in the area. In 1897 the Washington Forest Reserve was set aside, essentially preserving the forestland that would later become the park. By 1905, the management of the reserve was transferred from the U.S. Department of the Interior to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Forest Service was subsequently created to administer these forest reserves nationwide, which were redesignated as National Forests.[10] Though the Department of Agriculture allowed commercial enterprises the right to log the forest with a permit, most of the timber taken from the region was used only locally for the construction of cabins and similar small scale enterprises. Logging expanded when the Skagit River Hydroelectric Project was commenced by the public utility Seattle City Light in the 1920s.[18] Almost 12,000 acres (4,900?ha) of timber would have been left underwater by the completion of the Ross Dam. A contract to extract the timber was awarded in 1945 and the project was not completed until 1958.[10] None of the dams or areas that were extensively logged are within the current boundaries of the national park, but they are in the adjoining Ross Lake National Recreation Area.\\r\\nThe establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872 and Yosemite National Park in 1890, led preservationists to argue for similar protections for other areas in the U.S. Even before the North Cascade region was provided some protection when it was designated a Forest Reserve in 1897, activists argued that the region should be afforded the greater protection accorded from a National Park designation.[21] A petition was submitted in 1892 by Washington state citizens to establish a national park to the north of Lake Chelan, as many who had visited the region believed it to have scenery, \\"greater than Switzerland's\\".[22] Further efforts surfaced in 1906 and again in the years between 1916 and 1921, when several bills to designate the region a national park failed to get ratification from the U.S. Congress.[22] Not all locals supported the idea of a national park, as they felt that such a designation would negatively impact their economic situation. The U.S. Forest service was also not in favor of a park as that would mean they would have to relinquish control over the land, an event that was not uncommon since many parks that were being established were originally managed by the Forest Service. In an effort to appease their detractors, the U.S. Forest Service designated Primitive Areas which would provide increased protections to some of the most pristine regions they managed.[22] By the mid-1930s, forester Bob Marshall argued that the region should be set aside as wilderness, as that would keep the National Park Service out since their mandate would force them to construct roads and build \\"improvements\\" for the sake of tourism. Rival interests continued to argue over whether the lands should remain under the management of the U.S. Forest Service or the National Park Service but by the 1960s, the environmentalist argument advocating for a national park prevailed.[22] Though the North Cascades National Park Act designated the region as a National Park on October 2, 1968, the National Park Service did not commence direct management until January 1, 1969.[23] The North Cascades National Park Act also designated Ross Lake and Lake Chelan National Recreation Areas. Redwood National Park in California was also signed into existence on the same day as the North Cascades.[22] By 1988, much of Bob Marshall's original plan to set aside the future park as wilderness was achieved when 93?percent of North Cascades National Park was designated as the Stephen Mather Wilderness.[24]\\r\\nNorth Cascades National Park is managed by the National Park Service and the park headquarters is in Sedro-Woolley, Washington. The park consists of a northern and a southern district or unit. These are separated by Ross Lake National Recreation Area. The southeast boundary of the southern district abuts Lake Chelan National Recreation Area; the park and two recreation areas are managed as the North Cascades National Park Complex.[25] The three entities were all established in 1968 and in 1988, much of the park complex was designated wilderness as the Stephen Mather Wilderness, preventing further non-natural alterations to 93?percent of the park.[24][26] The mandate of the National Park Service is to \\"...?preserve and protect natural and cultural resources\\". The Organic Act of August 25, 1916, established the National Park Service as a federal agency. One major section of the Act has often been summarized as the \\"Mission\\", \\"...?to promote and regulate the use of the?... national parks?... which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\\"[27] In keeping with this mandate, hunting is illegal in the park, as is mining, logging and removal of natural or cultural resources. Additionally, oil and gas exploration and extraction are not permitted.\\r\\nIn 2016, North Cascades National Park recorded 28,646 visitors, while adjoining Ross Lake National Recreation Area reported 905,418 visitors and Lake Chelan National Recreation Area had 45,514 visitors.[3] Peak visitation is between the months of June and September.[26] The vast majority of visitors come to Ross Lake National Recreation Area which is easily accessible on Washington State Route 20, also known as the North Cascades Highway, and the only road which bisects the park complex. North Cascades National Park Complex had an operating base budget of $7,700,000 for fiscal year 2010, augmented by another $3,700,000 of non-base funding which can fluctuate significantly from year to year, and additional funding from revenue generated from concessionaire contracts and user fees. Much of the budget is for staffing, with 83?percent directed to pay for the employ of 81 permanent employees, not all of which are employed year-round, and the nearly 250 seasonal and term employees that work primarily in the summer months.[26]\\r\\nThe North Cascades National Park Complex management activities include facilities management, which oversees the maintenance and construction of roads, 396 miles (637?km) of trails and 260 buildings, and resource management, which is involved in areas as diverse as fire management, biological resource management and glacier monitoring. Park employees also provide law enforcement, search and rescue, medical response, interpretive services and educational outreach, and the administrative division which oversees budgets, personnel and contracting services.[26]\\r\\nNorth Cascades National Park is located in portions of Whatcom, Skagit, and Chelan counties in the U.S. state of Washington. Bisected by Ross Lake National Recreation Area, the park consists of two districts; the northern and southern. The northern boundary of the north district is also the international border between the U.S. and Canada; the latter manages adjoining Skagit Valley Provincial Park. The entire eastern and southern boundary of the north district is bordered by Ross Lake NRA. The western side of the north district is bordered by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest within which lies the Mount Baker and Noisy-Diobsud Wildernesses, both of which border the park.[28][29][30] Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest also borders a portion of the southern district of North Cascades National Park, to the southwest. Also along the southwest border lies Wenatchee National Forest, within which lies the Glacier Peak Wilderness.[28][31] The southern boundary of the park is shared with Lake Chelan NRA, while a small section of the eastern boundary is shared with Okanogan National Forest.[28] The Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness lies in Wenatchee and Okanogan National Forests along the southeastern park boundary.[32] North Cascades National Park has nearly 9,000 feet (2,700?m) of vertical relief, with a park high point atop Goode Mountain and the western valleys situated at only around 400?ft (120?m) above mean sea level, the park has a highly varied ecosystem, including eight life zones.[33][34] Erosion from water and glacial ice have made the mountain peaks of the North Cascades some of the steepest mountain ranges in the contiguous U.S., rising between 4,000 and 6,000?ft (1,200 and 1,800?m) above their bases.[35] North Cascades National Park is home to over 300 glaciers as well as 300 lakes and is the headwaters for the Skagit, Stehekin and Nooksack Rivers.[34][36] The ruggedness of the terrain has been an obstacle to urbanization and consequently, North Cascades National Park is almost entirely wilderness though it is but 120 miles (190?km) from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Seattle, Washington.[37]\\r\\nNamed after the mountain peaks that are the central feature of the region, the North Cascades are a subsection of the Cascade Range which extends from northern California into British Columbia, Canada. The North Cascades are the northern section of the Cascade Range and unlike their southern counterparts, which consist mostly of Tertiary to Holocene volcanic rocks, the North Cascades are composed primarily of Mesozoic crystalline and metamorphic rocks.[38] The exposed rocks predate the middle Devonian and are approximately 400?million years old.[39] Much harder and more durable than the newer volcanic rocks of the southern Cascades, the North Cascades are consequently more rugged, with steep terrain being the norm due to heavy erosion from water and ice.[40] Apparently still rising, the North Cascades originally formed from the jumbled masses of various rock structures that had their origination point thousands of miles to the south some 90?million years ago. By 40?million years ago, the heavier basaltic rocks of the ocean floor had started to push the lighter granitic rocks that are the core of the park's mountains upward, a process that is ongoing.[41] Continued rising in conjunction with erosion from water and ice has created deep valleys and consequently, the vertical relief is significant, averaging between 4,000 and 6,000?ft (1,200 and 1,800?m), which is comparable to much taller mountain ranges.[40]\\r\\nThe tallest mountain in North Cascades National Park is Goode Mountain at 9,220?ft (2,810?m).[42] Goode Mountain is in a remote backcountry region of the southern section of the park.[43] Near Goode Mountain are several other peaks that exceed 9,000?ft (2,700?m) including Buckner Mountain (9,114?ft (2,778?m))[44] and Mount Logan (9,087?ft (2,770?m)).[45] Just under 9000 feet, about 5 miles (8.0?km) northeast of Goode Mountain, is Black Peak (8,970?ft (2,730?m)). Other prominent peaks in the southern section of the park include Boston Peak (8,894?ft (2,711?m)),[46] Eldorado Peak (8,868?ft (2,703?m))[47] and Forbidden Peak (8,815?ft (2,687?m)).[48]\\r\\nThe northern region of the park contains the Picket Range, a subrange of the Skagit Range, which is in turn a subrange of the North Cascades.[49] The Picket Range has numerous spires with ominous names such as Mount Fury, Mount Challenger, Poltergeist Pinnacle, Mount Terror, Ghost Peak and Phantom Peak, all of which exceed 8,000?ft (2,400?m). The Picket Range is only 6?mi (9.7?km) long yet contains 21 peaks over 7,500?ft (2,300?m).[49] North of the Picket Range and near the border with Canada lie Mount Redoubt (8,969?ft (2,734?m)), Mount Spickard (8,979?ft (2,737?m)) and the spires of the Mox Peaks (8,630?ft (2,630?m)).[50] Isolated and dominating the northwestern reaches of the park lies the oft photographed Mount Shuksan (9,131?ft (2,783?m)), which towers more than 8,400?ft (2,600?m) above Baker Lake only 6?mi (9.7?km) to the south.[51]\\r\\n500 lakes and ponds are located within North Cascades National Park complex.[52]\\r\\nWith approximately 312 glaciers, North Cascades National Park has the most glaciers of any U.S. park outside Alaska and a third of all the glaciers in the lower 48 states are in the park.[53] Counting a few glaciers in the adjoining National Recreation Areas, the North Cascades National Park Complex glaciers covered an expanse totalling 27,000 acres (110?km2) as of 2009.[54] The dense concentration and relative ease of access to the North Cascade glaciers brought about some of the earliest scientific series of studies regarding glaciology in the U.S. Beginning in 1955, The University of Washington sponsored Richard C. Hubley to undertake annual aerial photography expeditions designed to capture images of the glaciers and to show any alterations that might be occurring.[55] In 1960, Austin Post expanded the aerial coverage to include other regions and he also used ground based imagery to augment the research. In 1971, based on the photographic imagery and other data collected since 1955, Post and others wrote a groundbreaking report that documented the number and scale of glaciers in the North Cascades.[39] At the time of Austin Post's inventory, their study concluded that some North Cascades glaciers had experienced a period of minor growth or equilibrium in the mid-20th century, after undergoing decades of retreat. The study concluded that annual glacial melt due to seasonal variations has a significant influence on river levels, accounting for about 30?percent of the late summer water flow, which directly impacted the supported ecosystems such as salmon fisheries.[39]\\r\\nThe National Park Service (NPS), United States Geological Survey (USGS) and private researchers such as Mauri S. Pelto, who has led the North Cascades Glacier Climate Project since 1984, have continued research on North Cascade glaciers.[56] Since 1993, the NPS has conducted rigorous studies on four park glaciers: Noisy Creek, Silver, North Klawatti and Sandalee Glaciers.[57] The NPS research indicated that these four glaciers experienced rapid decrease in volumes between 1993 and 2011.[58] In 1998, a NPS and Portland State University aerial photographic inventory showed a 13?percent loss in parkwide glacial volume since Austin Post's inventory in 1971.[59] The NPS states that in the last 150?years since the end of the Little Ice Age, a period of several centuries in which the earth experienced a cooling phase, glacial ice volumes in the North Cascades have been reduced by 40?percent.[59] This loss of glacial ice has contributed to decreased melt in the summer. In the Thunder Creek watershed alone, this decreased runoff amounts to a loss of 30?percent of the summer streamflow.[53]\\r\\nBoston Glacier, on the north slope of Boston Peak, is the largest glacier in the park, measured in 1971 to have an area of 1,730 acres (7.0?km2).[42] Other large glaciers include East Nooksack and Sulphide Glaciers on Mount Shuksan, McAllister and Inspiration Glaciers on Eldorado Peak, Redoubt Glacier on Mount Redoubt, Neve Glacier on Snowfield Peak, and Challenger Glacier on Mount Challenger.\\r\\nVariation in rock and soil types, exposure, slope, elevation, and rainfall is reflected in the diverse plant life. Eight distinctive life zones support thousands of different plant species in the North Cascades greater ecosystem.\\r\\nNo other National Park surpasses North Cascades National Park's over 1,630 vascular plant species recorded. Estimates of non-vascular and fungal species could more than double the number of plant species in the North Cascades.[60] The park contains an estimated 236,000 acres (960?km2) of old-growth forests.[61] The biodiversity of the area is threatened by global climate change and invasive exotic plant species.[60] These exotic plants thrive by using man-made structures such as roads and trails.[60] These invasive plants include the diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa) and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea).[62]\\r\\nThe park also has a diversity of animal species, including timber wolf, coyote, bobcat, Canadian lynx, cougar, moose, elk, river otter, golden eagle, hoary marmot, bald eagle, pika, wolverine, mountain goat, grizzly bear, and black bear.[63] The park is home to 75 species of mammals and 200 species of birds that either pass through or use the North Cascades for a breeding area. There are also 11 species of fish on the west side of the Cascades.[63] Examples of amphibian species occurring in the park include the western toad (Bufo boreas) and the rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa).[64]\\r\\nNearly all of the national park is protected as the Stephen Mather Wilderness, so there are few maintained buildings and roads within the North and South units of the Park. The park is most popular with backpackers and mountain climbers. One of the most popular destinations in the park is Cascade Pass, which was used as a travel route by Native Americans. It can be accessed by a four-mile (6?km) trail at the end of a gravel road. The North and South Picket Ranges, Mount Triumph, as well as Eldorado Peak and the surrounding mountains, are popular with climbers due to glaciation and technical rock. Mount Shuksan, in the northwest corner of the park, is heavily photographed and the second highest peak in the park 9,127?ft or 2,782?m.\\r\\nAlthough a couple of gravel roads open to the public enter the park (Cascade River Road beginning at Marblemount off HWY #20 and the Upper Stehekin Valley Road accessed from Stehekin via tour-boat from Chelan), most automobile traffic in the region travels on the North Cascades Highway (Washington State Route 20), which passes through the Ross Lake National Recreation Area.\\r\\nThe nearest large town on the west side of the park is Sedro-Woolley, Washington, while Winthrop lies to the east. Chelan is located at the southeastern end of Lake Chelan where east-side access to the NCNP from Stehekin serves the Eastern Washington communities.\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from websites or documents of the National Park Service.","input":"Where is the north cascades national park located?"},{"output":"Eliza Gladys \\"Millvina\\" Dean","context":"Eliza Gladys \\"Millvina\\" Dean (2 February 1912 ÿ 31 May 2009) was a British civil servant and cartographer. She was the last remaining survivor of the sinking of the RMS Titanic on 15 April 1912.[1] At 2 months old, she was also the youngest passenger aboard.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDean was born in Branscombe, England, to Bertram Frank Dean (1886ÿ1912) and Georgette Eva Light (1879ÿ1975). She had an older brother, Bertram Vere Dean, born 21 May 1910. She never married and had no children.[3] Her father died on the Titanic; her mother died on 16 September 1975, aged 96; and her brother died on 14 April 1992, age 81, the 80th anniversary of the iceberg collision.\\r\\nDean's parents decided to leave the United Kingdom and emigrate to Wichita, Kansas, where her father had relatives, and his cousin owned a tobacco shop that he was going to co-own.[4] They were not supposed to be aboard the Titanic, but due to a coal strike, they were transferred onto it and boarded it as third-class passengers at Southampton, England. Dean was barely two months old when she boarded the ship. Her father felt its collision with the iceberg on the night of 14 April 1912, and after investigating, returned to his cabin, telling his wife to dress the children and go up on deck. Dean, her mother, and her brother were placed in Lifeboat 10 and were among the first third-class passengers to escape.[i] Her father, however, did not survive, and his body, if recovered, was never identified.\\r\\nAt first, Dean's mother wanted to continue on to Kansas to fulfil her husband's wish of a new life in the United States. However, after losing him and being left with two small children for whom to care, they returned to Britain aboard the RMS?Adriatic. While aboard the ship, Dean attracted considerable attention. An article in the Daily Mirror dated 12 May 1912 described the ordeal:\\r\\nMillvina and Bertram were raised mostly on pension funds and educated in Southampton schools, including The Gregg School. It was not until she was eight years old, and her mother was planning to remarry, that Dean was told she had been a passenger on the Titanic.\\r\\nDean worked for the British government during the Second World War and later as a purchaser for a local engineering firm. Other careers she held were as a cartographer, a secretary, and an assistant to a tobacconist.\\r\\nIt was not until Dean was in her seventies that she became involved in Titanic-related events. Over the years, she participated in numerous conventions, exhibitions, documentaries, radio and television interviews, and personal correspondence. In 1998, she travelled to the United States to participate in a Titanic convention in Springfield, Massachusetts, and another in 1999 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She had also been scheduled to appear at a commemoration of the 94th anniversary of the sinking in 2006, but a broken hip prevented her appearance.[6] She also appeared in the History special Titanic's Final Moments: Missing Pieces.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn October 2007, Dean became the last Titanic survivor following the death of Barbara West Dainton, who died at age 96 in England.[7]\\r\\nIn December 2007, Dean criticised the BBC and its television programme Doctor Who for including an episode with a starship \\"cruise liner\\" called the Titanic, that was similar in appearance to the historical liner. Speaking from her nursing home, she said: \\"The Titanic was a tragedy which tore so many families apart. I lost my father and he lies on that wreck. I think it is disrespectful to make entertainment of such a tragedy.\\"[8] A spokeswoman for the show said: \\"No offence was intended. 'Voyage of the Damned' is set on a spaceship called The Titanic and not a boat.\\"[8]\\r\\nIn April 2008, Dean had accepted an invitation to speak in Southampton at an event commemorating the 96th anniversary of the sinking, but ill health resulting from a respiratory infection forced her to cancel.[9]\\r\\nIn December 2008, at age 96, Dean was forced to sell several of her family's possessions to pay for her private medical care following a broken hip. These included a letter sent to her mother from the Titanic Relief Fund, and a suitcase given to her and her mother in New York following the sinking. Their sale raised approximately S32,000. In February 2009, she announced that she would be selling several more items to pay for her increasing medical costs which she said exceeded S3,000 a month.[10]\\r\\nDean died of pneumonia on the morning of 31 May 2009, 97 years and seven weeks after the Titanic sailed, at a care home in Ashurst, Hampshire.[2][11] She was cremated, and on 24 October 2009, her ashes were scattered from a launch at the docks in Southampton where the Titanic set sail.[12]\\r\\nIn response to the escalating cost of Dean's healthcare, The Millvina Fund was set up in April 2009 by the Belfast, British, and International Titanic Societies with the exclusive aim of taking care of her nursing home bills. It was given a boost by the Irish author and campaigning journalist, Don Mullan, at the opening of his worldwide Nokia photographic exhibition, A Thousand Reasons for Living, (featuring a portrait of Dean) in Dublin on 22 April 2009.[13] Mullan introduced an additional portrait of Dean's hands, as she signed a card for a Titanic autograph collector, which he produced as a limited edition of 100 copies. He made the edition available at ?500 each and then challenged the director and stars of the film Titanic (1997) - James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kate Winslet - singer Celine Dion, and the corporations Sony Music, 20th Century Fox, and Paramount Pictures to match him euro-for-euro to support her with her bills.[14][15] DiCaprio and Winslet led the way with a joint contribution of US$20,000. Cameron and Dion donated US$10,000 each.","input":"Who was the last surviving member of the titanic?"},{"output":"over 300","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eiffel Tower (/?a?f?l/ EYE-f?l; French: tour Eiffel [tu???f?l]?(?listen)) is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstructed from 1887ÿ89 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[3] The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.91?million people ascended it in 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower is 324 metres (1,063?ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410?ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17?ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276?m (906?ft) above the ground ÿ the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design of the Eiffel Tower was the product of Maurice Koechlin and mile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des tablissements Eiffel, after discussion about a suitable centrepiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution. Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853.[4] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \\"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\\".[5] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was exhibited at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name. On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the Socit des Ingnieurs Civils; after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise, \\r\\nNot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle progress was made until 1886, when Jules Grvy was re-elected as president of France and douard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300?m (980?ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.[6] (A 300-meter tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort). On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. This was signed by Eiffel acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, and granted him 1.5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.5 million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years. He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds. These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering. It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \\"Committee of Three Hundred\\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet. A petition called \\"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Charles Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection  of this useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower  To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream. And for twenty years  we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nGustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: \\"My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man. Will it not also be grandiose in its way? And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\\"[9] These criticisms were also dealt with by douard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, ironically saying,[10] \\"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection. Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \\"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built; others remained unconvinced.[12] Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a calligram) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.[14] Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art, and is often featured in films and literature.\\r\\n\\r\\nWork on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.[15] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2?m (6.6?ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15?m (49?ft) long and 6?m (20?ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22?m (72?ft)[16] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6?m (20?ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10?cm (4?in) in diameter and 7.5?m (25?ft) long. The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began. The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.[17] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 0.1?mm (0.0039?in) and angles worked out to one second of arc. The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration. In all, 18,038 pieces were joined together using 2.5?million rivets.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level, construction was paused in order to create a substantial timber scaffold. This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \\"Eiffel Suicide!\\" and \\"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\\" appeared in the tabloid press.[18] At this stage, a small \\"creeper\\" crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg. They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs. The critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of March 1888.[15] Although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small adjustments in order to precisely align the legs; hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold. Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,[15] only one person died thanks to Eiffel's stringent safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens[citation needed].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe start of the erection of the metalwork.\\r\\n\\r\\n7 December 1887: Construction of the legs with scaffolding.\\r\\n\\r\\n20 March 1888: Completion of the first level.\\r\\n\\r\\n15 May 1888: Start of construction on the second stage.\\r\\n\\r\\n21 August 1888: Completion of the second level.\\r\\n\\r\\n26 December 1888: Construction of the upper stage.\\r\\n\\r\\n15 March 1889: Construction of the cupola.\\r\\n\\r\\nEquipping the tower with adequate and safe passenger lifts was a major concern of the government commission overseeing the Exposition. Although some visitors could be expected to climb to the first level, or even the second, lifts clearly had to be the main means of ascent.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstructing lifts to reach the first level was relatively straightforward: the legs were wide enough at the bottom and so nearly straight that they could contain a straight track, and a contract was given to the French company Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape for two lifts to be fitted in the east and west legs.[20] Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape used a pair of endless chains with rigid, articulated links to which the car was attached. Lead weights on some links of the upper or return sections of the chains counterbalanced most of the car's weight. The car was pushed up from below, not pulled up from above: to prevent the chain buckling, it was enclosed in a conduit. At the bottom of the run, the chains passed around 3.9?m (12?ft 10?in) diameter sprockets. Smaller sprockets at the top guided the chains.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nInstalling lifts to the second level was more of a challenge because a straight track was impossible. No French company wanted to undertake the work. The European branch of Otis Brothers & Company submitted a proposal but this was rejected: the fair's charter ruled out the use of any foreign material in the construction of the tower. The deadline for bids was extended but still no French companies put themselves forward, and eventually the contract was given to Otis in July 1887.[21] Otis were confident they would eventually be given the contract and had already started creating designs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe car was divided into two superimposed compartments, each holding 25 passengers, with the lift operator occupying an exterior platform on the first level. Motive power was provided by an inclined hydraulic ram 12.67?m (41?ft 7?in) long and 96.5?cm (38.0?in) in diameter in the tower leg with a stroke of 10.83?m (35?ft 6?in): this moved a carriage carrying six sheaves. Five fixed sheaves were mounted higher up the leg, producing an arrangement similar to a block and tackle but acting in reverse, multiplying the stroke of the piston rather than the force generated. The hydraulic pressure in the driving cylinder was produced by a large open reservoir on the second level. After being exhausted from the cylinder, the water was pumped back up to the reservoir by two pumps in the machinery room at the base of the south leg. This reservoir also provided power to the lifts to the first level.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original lifts for the journey between the second and third levels were supplied by Lon Edoux. A pair of 81?m (266?ft) hydraulic rams were mounted on the second level, reaching nearly halfway up to the third level. One lift car was mounted on top of these rams: cables ran from the top of this car up to sheaves on the third level and back down to a second car. Each car only travelled half the distance between the second and third levels and passengers were required to change lifts halfway by means of a short gangway. The 10-ton cars each held 65 passengers.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and, on 31 March, Eiffel celebrated by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower.[12] Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, mile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustr, completed the ascent. At 2:35?pm, Eiffel hoisted a large Tricolour to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired at the first level.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities, and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on 6 May; even then, the lifts had not been completed. The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May.[24]\\r\\nTickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays,[25] and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent out three beams of red, white and blue light. Two searchlights mounted on a circular rail were used to illuminate various buildings of the exposition. The daily opening and closing of the exposition were announced by a cannon at the top.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the second level, the French newspaper Le Figaro had an office and a printing press, where a special souvenir edition, Le Figaro de la Tour, was made. There was also a patisserie.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the top, there was a post office where visitors could send letters and postcards as a memento of their visit. Graffitists were also catered for: sheets of paper were mounted on the walls each day for visitors to record their impressions of the tower. Gustave Eiffel described some of the responses as vraiment curieuse (\\"truly curious\\").[26]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFamous visitors to the tower included the Prince of Wales, Sarah Bernhardt, \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody (his Wild West show was an attraction at the exposition) and Thomas Edison.[24] Eiffel invited Edison to his private apartment at the top of the tower, where Edison presented him with one of his phonographs, a new invention and one of the many highlights of the exposition.[27] Edison signed the guestbook with this message: \\r\\nTo M Eiffel the Engineer the brave builder of so gigantic and original specimen of modern Engineering from one who has the greatest respect and admiration for all Engineers including the Great Engineer the Bon Dieu, Thomas Edison.\\r\\n\\r\\nEiffel had a permit for the tower to stand for 20 years. It was to be dismantled in 1909, when its ownership would revert to the City of Paris. The City had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the tower proved to be valuable for communication purposes, it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit.\\r\\n\\r\\nEiffel made use of his apartment at the top of the tower to carry out meteorological observations, and also used the tower to perform experiments on the action of air resistance on falling bodies.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 1900 Exposition Universelle, the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille. These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism to the Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower. Hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism.[21] At the same time the lift in the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level. The layout of both first and second levels was modified, with the space available for visitors on the second level. The original lift in the south pillar was removed 13 years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 October 1901, Alberto Santos-Dumont, flying his No.6 airship, won a 100,000-franc prize offered by Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe for the first person to make a flight from St. Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back in less than half an hour.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany innovations took place at the Eiffel Tower in the early 20th century. In 1910, Father Theodor Wulf measured radiant energy at the top and bottom of the tower. He found more at the top than expected, incidentally discovering what are known today as cosmic rays.[30] Just two years later, on 4 February 1912, Austrian tailor Franz Reichelt died after jumping from the first level of the tower (a height of 57 metres) to demonstrate his parachute design.[31] In 1914, at the outbreak of World War?I, a radio transmitter located in the tower jammed German radio communications, seriously hindering their advance on Paris and contributing to the Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne.[32] From 1925 to 1934, illuminated signs for Citro?n adorned three of the tower's sides, making it the tallest advertising space in the world at the time.[citation needed] In April 1935, the tower was used to make experimental low-resolution television transmissions, using a shortwave transmitter of 200 watts power. On 17 November, an improved 180-line transmitter was installed.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn two separate but related occasions in 1925, the con artist Victor Lustig \\"sold\\" the tower for scrap metal.[34] A year later, in February 1926, pilot Leon Collet was killed trying to fly under the tower. His aircraft became entangled in an aerial belonging to a wireless station.[35] A bust of Gustave Eiffel by Antoine Bourdelle was unveiled at the base of the north leg on 2 May 1929.[36] In 1930, the tower lost the title of the world's tallest structure when the Chrysler Building in New York City was completed.[37] In 1938, the decorative arcade around the first level was removed.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the German occupation of Paris in 1940, the lift cables were cut by the French. The tower was closed to the public during the occupation and the lifts were not repaired until 1946.[39] In 1940, German soldiers had to climb the tower to hoist a swastika-centered Reichskriegsflagge,[40] but the flag was so large it blew away just a few hours later, and was replaced by a smaller one.[41] When visiting Paris, Hitler chose to stay on the ground. When the Allies were nearing Paris in August 1944, Hitler ordered General Dietrich von Choltitz, the military governor of Paris, to demolish the tower along with the rest of the city. Von Choltitz disobeyed the order.[42] On 25 June, before the Germans had been driven out of Paris, the German flag was replaced with a Tricolour by two men from the French Naval Museum, who narrowly beat three men led by Lucien Sarniguet, who had lowered the Tricolour on 13 June 1940 when Paris fell to the Germans.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nA fire started in the television transmitter on 3 January 1956, damaging the top of the tower. Repairs took a year, and in 1957, the present radio aerial was added to the top.[43] In 1964, the Eiffel Tower was officially declared to be a historical monument by the Minister of Cultural Affairs, Andr Malraux.[44] A year later, an additional lift system was installed in the north pillar.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to interviews, in 1967, Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau negotiated a secret agreement with Charles de Gaulle for the tower to be dismantled and temporarily relocated to Montreal to serve as a landmark and tourist attraction during Expo 67. The plan was allegedly vetoed by the company operating the tower out of fear that the French government could refuse permission for the tower to be restored in its original location.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1982, the original lifts between the second and third levels were replaced after 97 years in service. These had been closed to the public between November and March because the water in the hydraulic drive tended to freeze. The new cars operate in pairs, with one counterbalancing the other, and perform the journey in one stage, reducing the journey time from eight minutes to less than two minutes. At the same time, two new emergency staircases were installed, replacing the original spiral staircases. In 1983, the south pillar was fitted with an electrically driven Otis lift to serve the Jules Verne restaurant.[citation needed] The Fives-Lille lifts in the east and west legs, fitted in 1899, were extensively refurbished in 1986. The cars were replaced, and a computer system was installed to completely automate the lifts. The motive power was moved from the water hydraulic system to a new electrically driven oil-filled hydraulic system, and the original water hydraulics were retained solely as a counterbalance system.[45] A service lift was added to the south pillar for moving small loads and maintenance personnel three years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Moriarty flew a Beechcraft Bonanza under the tower on 31 March 1984.[47] In 1987, A.J. Hackett made one of his first bungee jumps from the top of the Eiffel Tower, using a special cord he had helped develop. Hackett was arrested by the police.[48] On 27 October 1991, Thierry Devaux, along with mountain guide Herv Calvayrac, performed a series of acrobatic figures while bungee jumping from the second floor of the tower.[49] Facing the Champ de Mars, Devaux used an electric winch between figures to go back up to the second floor. When firemen arrived, he stopped after the sixth jump.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor its \\"Countdown to the Year 2000\\" celebration on 31 December 1999, flashing lights and high-powered searchlights were installed on the tower. Fireworks were set off all over it. An exhibition above a cafeteria on the first floor commemorates this event. The searchlights on top of the tower made it a beacon in Paris's night sky, and 20,000 flashing bulbs gave the tower a sparkly appearance for five minutes every hour on the hour.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lights sparkled blue for several nights to herald the new millennium On 31 December 2000. The sparkly lighting continued for 18 months until July 2001. The sparkling lights were turned on again on 21 June 2003, and the display was planned to last for 10 years before they needed replacing.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower received its 200,000,000th guest on 28 November 2002.[52] The tower has operated at its maximum capacity of about 7?million visitors since 2003.[53] In 2004, the Eiffel Tower began hosting a seasonal ice rink on the first level.[54] A glass floor was installed on the first level during the 2014 refurbishment.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe puddled iron (wrought iron) of the Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 tons,[56] and the addition of lifts, shops and antennae have brought the total weight to approximately 10,100?tons.[57] As a demonstration of the economy of design, if the 7,300?tons of metal in the structure were melted down, it would fill the square base, 125 metres (410?ft) on each side, to a depth of only 6.25?cm (2.46?in) assuming the density of the metal to be 7.8?tons per cubic metre.[58] Additionally, a cubic box surrounding the tower (324?m x 125?m x 125?m) would contain 6,200?tons of air, weighing almost as much as the iron itself. Depending on the ambient temperature, the top of the tower may shift away from the sun by up to 18?cm (7?in) due to thermal expansion of the metal on the side facing the sun.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was built, many were shocked by the tower's daring form. Eiffel was accused of trying to create something artistic with no regard to the principles of engineering. However, Eiffel and his team ÿ experienced bridge builders ÿ understood the importance of wind forces, and knew that if they were going to build the tallest structure in the world, they had to be sure it could withstand them. In an interview with the newspaper Le Temps published on 14 February 1887, Eiffel said:\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it not true that the very conditions which give strength also conform to the hidden rules of harmony?  Now to what phenomenon did I have to give primary concern in designing the Tower? It was wind resistance. Well then! I hold that the curvature of the monument's four outer edges, which is as mathematical calculation dictated it should be  will give a great impression of strength and beauty, for it will reveal to the eyes of the observer the boldness of the design as a whole.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe used graphical methods to determine the strength of the tower and empirical evidence to account for the effects of wind, rather than a mathematical formula. Close examination of the tower reveals a basically exponential shape.[61] All parts of the tower were over-designed to ensure maximum resistance to wind forces. The top half was even assumed to have no gaps in the latticework.[62] In the years since it was completed, engineers have put forward various mathematical hypotheses in an attempt to explain the success of the design. The most recent, devised in 2004 after letters sent by Eiffel to the French Society of Civil Engineers in 1885 were translated into English, is described as a non-linear integral equation based on counteracting the wind pressure on any point of the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eiffel Tower sways by up to 9?centimetres (3.5?in) in the wind.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen originally built, the first level contained three restaurantsone French, one Russian and one Flemishand an \\"Anglo-American Bar\\". After the exposition closed, the Flemish restaurant was converted to a 250-seat theatre. A promenade 2.6-metre (8?ft 6?in) wide ran around the outside of the first level. At the top, there were laboratories for various experiments, and a small apartment reserved for Gustave Eiffel to entertain guests, which is now open to the public, complete with period decorations and lifelike mannequins of Eiffel and some of his notable guests.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2016, an apartment was created on the first level to accommodate four competition winners during the UEFA Euro 2016 football tournament in Paris in June. The apartment has a kitchen, two bedrooms, a lounge, and views of Paris landmarks including the Seine, the Sacre Coeur, and the Arc de Triomphe.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arrangement of the lifts has been changed several times during the tower's history. Given the elasticity of the cables and the time taken to align the cars with the landings, each lift, in normal service, takes an average of 8 minutes and 50 seconds to do the round trip, spending an average of 1 minute and 15 seconds at each level. The average journey time between levels is 1 minute. The original hydraulic mechanism is on public display in a small museum at the base of the east and west legs. Because the mechanism requires frequent lubrication and maintenance, public access is often restricted. The rope mechanism of the north tower can be seen as visitors exit the lift.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGustave Eiffel engraved on the tower the names of 72 French scientists, engineers and mathematicians in recognition of their contributions to the building of the tower. Eiffel chose this \\"invocation of science\\" because of his concern over the artists' protest. At the beginning of the 20th century, the engravings were painted over, but they were restored in 1986ÿ87 by the Socit Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel, a company operating the tower.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower is painted in three shades: lighter at the top, getting progressively darker towards the bottom to complement the Parisian sky.[67] It was originally reddish brown; this changed in 1968 to a bronze colour known as \\"Eiffel Tower Brown\\".[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only non-structural elements are the four decorative grill-work arches, added in Sauvestre's sketches, which served to make the tower look more substantial and to make a more impressive entrance to the exposition.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nA pop-culture movie clich is that the view from a Parisian window always includes the tower.[70] In reality, since zoning restrictions limit the height of most buildings in Paris to seven storeys, only a small number of tall buildings have a clear view of the tower.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaintenance of the tower includes applying 60?tons of paint every seven years to prevent it from rusting. The tower has been completely repainted at least 19 times since it was built. Lead paint was still being used as recently as 2001 when the practice was stopped out of concern for the environment.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nearest Paris Mtro station is Bir-Hakeim and the nearest RER station is Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel.[71] The tower itself is located at the intersection of the quai Branly and the Pont d'Ina.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 250?million people have visited the tower since it was completed in 1889.[3] In 2015, there were 6.91?million visitors.[72] The tower is one the most-visited paid monument in the world.[73] An average of 25,000 people ascend the tower every day which can result in long queues.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower has two restaurants: Le 58 Tour Eiffel on the first level, and Le Jules Verne, a gourmet restaurant with its own lift on the second level. This restaurant has one star in the Michelin Red Guide. It is run by the multi-Michelin star chef Alain Ducasse[75] and owes its name to the famous science-fiction writer Jules Verne. Additionally, there is a champagne bar at the top of the Eiffel Tower.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, the Eiffel Tower has been the inspiration for the creation of many replicas and similar towers. An early example is Blackpool Tower in England. The mayor of Blackpool, Sir John Bickerstaffe, was so impressed on seeing the Eiffel Tower at the 1889 exposition that he commissioned a similar tower to be built in his town. It opened in 1894 and is 158.1?metres (518?ft) tall.[76] Tokyo Tower in Japan, built as a communications tower in 1958, was also inspired by the Eiffel Tower.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are various scale models of the tower in the United States, including a half-scale version at the Paris Las Vegas, Nevada, one in Paris, Texas built in 1993, and two 1:3 scale models at Kings Island, Ohio, and Kings Dominion, Virginia, amusement parks opened in 1972 and 1975 respectively. Two 1:3 scale models can be found in China, one in Durango, Mexico that was donated by the local French community, and several across Europe.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, the TV show Pricing the Priceless on the National Geographic Channel speculated that a full-size replica of the tower would cost approximately US$480?million to build.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower has been used for making radio transmissions since the beginning of the 20th century. Until the 1950s, sets of aerial wires ran from the cupola to anchors on the Avenue de Suffren and Champ de Mars. These were connected to longwave transmitters in small bunkers. In 1909, a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar, which still exists today. On 20 November 1913, the Paris Observatory, using the Eiffel Tower as an aerial, exchanged wireless signals with the United States Naval Observatory, which used an aerial in Arlington, Virginia. The object of the transmissions was to measure the difference in longitude between Paris and Washington, D.C.[80] Today, radio and digital television signals are transmitted from the Eiffel Tower.\\r\\n\\r\\nA television antenna was first installed on the tower in 1957, increasing its height by 18.7?m (61.4?ft). Work carried out in 2000 added a further 5.3?m (17.4?ft), giving the current height of 324?m (1,063?ft).[51] Analogue television signals from the Eiffel Tower ceased on 8 March 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower and its image have long been in the public domain.[81] In June 1990 a French court ruled that a special lighting display on the tower in 1989 to mark the tower's 100th anniversary was an \\"original visual creation\\" protected by copyright. The Court of Cassation, France's judicial court of last resort, upheld the ruling in March 1992.[82] The Socit d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SETE) now considers any illumination of the tower to be a separate work of art that falls under copyright.[83] As a result, the SNTE alleges that it is illegal to publish contemporary photographs of the lit tower at night without permission in France and some other countries for commercial use.[84][85]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe imposition of copyright has been controversial. The Director of Documentation for what was then called the Socit Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SNTE), Stphane Dieu, commented in 2005: \\"It is really just a way to manage commercial use of the image, so that it isn't used in ways [of which] we don't approve\\".[86] SNTE made over ?1?million from copyright fees in 2002.[87] However, it could also be used to restrict the publication of tourist photographs of the tower at night, as well as hindering non-profit and semi-commercial publication of images of the illuminated tower.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench doctrine and jurisprudence allows pictures incorporating a copyrighted work as long as their presence is incidental or accessory to the subject being represented,[88] a reasoning akin to the de minimis rule. Therefore, SETE may be unable to claim copyright on photographs of Paris which happen to include the lit tower.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eiffel Tower was the world's tallest structure when completed in 1889, a distinction it retained until 1929 when the Chrysler Building in New York City was topped out.[89] The tower has lost its standing both as the world's tallest structure and the world's tallest lattice tower but retains its status as the tallest freestanding (non-guyed) structure in France.","input":"How many stairs to the first level of the eiffel tower?"},{"output":"Mr. Potato Head","context":"Mr. Potato Head is an American toy consisting of a plastic model of a potato which can be decorated with a variety of plastic parts that can attach to the main body. These parts usually include ears, eyes, shoes, a hat, a nose, and a mouth. The toy was invented and developed by George Lerner in 1949, and first manufactured and distributed by Hasbro in 1952.[1] Mr. Potato Head was the first toy advertised on television[2][3] and has remained in production since its debut. The toy was originally produced as separate plastic parts with pushpins that could be stuck into a real potato or other vegetable. However, due to complaints regarding rotting vegetables and new government safety regulations, Hasbro began including a plastic potato body within the toy set in 1964.[4]\\r\\nOver the years, the original toy was joined by Mrs. Potato Head and supplemented with accessories such as a car and a boat trailer. Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head may be best known for their appearances in the Toy Story franchise. Additionally, in 1998 The Mr. Potato Head Show aired but was short-lived, with only one season being produced.[5] As one of the prominent marks of Hasbro, a Mr. Potato Head balloon has also joined others in the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.[6] Today, Mr. Potato Head can still be seen adorning hats, shirts, and ties. Toy Story Midway Mania!, in Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort, also features a large talking Mr. Potato Head.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1940s, Brooklyn-born toy inventor George Lerner came up with the idea of inserting small, pronged body and face parts into fruits and vegetables to create a \\"funny face man\\". Some speculate he got the idea from his wife's nephew Aaron Bradley, who was seen placing sticks inside of potatoes in the family garden.[2] Lerner would often take potatoes from his mother's garden and, using various other fruits and vegetables as facial features, he would make dolls with which his younger sisters could play. The grape-eyed, carrot-nosed, potato-headed dolls became the principal idea behind the plastic toy which would later be manufactured.\\r\\nIn the beginning, Lerner's toy proved controversial. With World War II and food rationing a recent memory for most Americans, the use of fruits and vegetables to make toys was considered irresponsible and wasteful. Toy companies rejected Lerner's creation.[2] After several years of trying to sell the toy, Lerner finally convinced a food company to distribute the plastic parts as premiums in breakfast cereal boxes. He sold the idea for $5,000. But in 1951, Lerner showed the idea to Henry and Merrill Hassenfeld, who conducted a small school supply and toy business called Hassenfeld Brothers (later changed to Hasbro). Realizing the toy was quite unlike anything in their line, they paid the cereal company $2,000 to stop production and bought the rights for $5,000. Lerner was offered an advance of $500 and a 5% royalty on every kit sold. The toy was dubbed Mr. Potato Head and went into production.[2]\\r\\nMr. Potato Head was \\"born\\" on May 1, 1952. The original toy cost $0.98, and contained hands, feet, ears, two mouths, two pairs of eyes, four noses, three hats, eyeglasses, a pipe, and eight felt pieces resembling facial hair. The original Mr. Potato Head kit did not come with a potato \\"body\\", so parents had to provide their own potato into which children could stick the various pieces. Shortly after the toy's initial release, an order form for 50 additional pieces was enclosed in every kit.[2]\\r\\nOn April 30, 1952, Mr. Potato Head became the first toy advertised on television. The campaign was also the first to be aimed directly at children; before this, commercials were only targeted at adults, so toy adverts had always been pitched to parents.[8] This commercial revolutionized marketing, and caused an industrial boom. Over one million kits were sold in the first year.[2] In 1953, Mrs. Potato Head was added, and soon after, Brother Spud and Sister Yam completed the Potato Head family with accessories reflecting the affluence of the fifties that included a car, a boat trailer,[9] a kitchen set, a stroller, and pets called Spud-ettes. Although originally produced as separate plastic parts to be stuck into a real potato or other vegetable, a plastic potato was added to the kit in 1964.[1]\\r\\nIn the 1960s, government regulations forced the Potato Head parts to be less sharp, leaving them unable to puncture vegetables easily. By 1964, the company was therefore forced to include a plastic potato \\"body\\" in its kit. Little children were also choking on the small pieces and cutting themselves with the sharp pieces.[10] About this time, Hasbro introduced Oscar the Orange and Pete the Pepper, a plastic orange and green pepper with attachable face parts similar to Mr. Potato Head's. Each came with Mr. Potato Head in a separate kit. Female characters Katie the Carrot and Cooky the Cucumber also made an appearance. Hasbro also made a fast food based line called Mr. Potato Head's Picnic Pals. Some characters were Mr. Soda Pop Head and Frankie Frank. The friends and pals were later discontinued, but Funko revived Oscar and Pete as bobbleheads (along with a Mr. Potato Head bobblehead) in 2002.\\r\\nIn 1975, the main potato part of the toy doubled in size and the dimensions of its accessories were similarly increased. This was done mainly because of new toy child safety regulations that were introduced by the U.S. government. This change in size also increased the market to younger children, enabling them to play and attach the facial pieces easily. Hasbro also replaced the holes with flat slats, which made it impossible for users to put the face pieces and other body parts the wrong way around. In the 1980s, Hasbro reduced the range of accessories for Mr. Potato Head to one set of parts. The company did, however, reintroduce round holes in the main potato body, and once again parts were able to go onto the toy in the wrong locations.\\r\\nIn 1985, Mr. Potato Head received four postal votes in the run for mayor of Boise, Idaho in the \\"most votes for Mr. Potato Head in a political campaign\\" as verified by Guinness World Records.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1987, Mr. Potato Head became \\"Spokespud\\" for the annual Great American Smokeout and surrendered his pipe to Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in Washington, D.C.[1]\\r\\nIn 1995, Mr. Potato Head made his debut in Hollywood with a leading role in the Disney/Pixar animated feature Toy Story,[1] with the voice provided by the late comedian Don Rickles.\\r\\nIn 2000, Mr. Potato Head was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in Rochester, NY.\\r\\nIn 2006, Hasbro also began selling sets of pieces without bodies for customers to add to their collections. Some of these themed sets included Chef, Construction Worker, Firefighter, Halloween, King, Mermaid, Police Officer, Pirate, Princess, Rockstar, and Santa Claus. In the same year, Hasbro introduced a line called \\"Sports Spuds\\"[11] with a generic plastic potato (smaller than the standard size) customized to a wide variety of professional and collegiate teams.\\r\\nIn recent years, Hasbro has produced Potato Head sets based on media properties that Hasbro produces toys for under license. These include the Star Wars-themed \\"Darth Tater\\",[12] \\"Spud Trooper\\" and \\"R2-POTATOO\\",[1][12] a 2007 Transformers film-themed \\"Optimash Prime\\"[12][13] (the look is based on the original Optimus Prime from the original television series), a pair of Spider-Man-themed \\"Spider-Spud/Peter Tater\\" (both red suit and black suit, to tie in with Spider-Man 3), an Indiana Jones-themed \\"Taters of the Lost Ark\\"[12][14] set (which, despite the title, was released as a tie-in to 2008's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), an Iron Man 2-themed \\"Tony Starch\\",[12] and a \\"Trick or Tater\\" version for Halloween in October 2008. An additional five Star Wars-themed potato heads were sold exclusively through Disney theme parks: \\"Luke Frywalker,\\" \\"Yam Solo,\\"[12] \\"Spuda Fett,\\" \\"Princess Tater,\\" and \\"Darth Mash.\\"\\r\\nIn 2009, \\"Bumble Spud\\" was produced based on the movie Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. A Kiss version of Mr. Potato Head was produced recently. Disney, in cooperation with Hasbro, also released \\"Chipbacca\\", \\"Mashter Yoda\\",[12] and \\"C-3PotatO\\"[12] in October 2009 at Disney Parks. To celebrate Toy Story 3, five new Mr. Potato Heads were unveiled including Woody, Buzz Lightyear,[12] Jessie, Mrs. Potato Head, and the classic Mr. Potato Head.[15] To promote The Looney Tunes Show, Hasbro unveiled Bugs Bunny-, Daffy Duck- and Tasmanian Devil-themed Mr. Potato Head dolls.\\r\\nIn 2011, it was announced at the New York Toy Fair that a second Elvis Mr. Potato Head (based on his 1968 TV special) would be released,[12] as well as sets for The Wizard of Oz (Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Lion), the Three Stooges, and Star Trek (Kirk and Kor). These were all released through PPW toys. From Hasbro, there will be a SpongeBob SquarePants release as well.\\r\\nSince 2011, new models of the Mr. Potato Head toys, commonly referred to as Jason, have been produced. The Mrs. Potato Head version of the toy was also brought out in early 2012, commonly known as Rachel, and has a baked bean-like head. In 2012, Hasbro and PPW Toys released Mr. Potato Head in Batman form for the movie The Dark Knight Rises. The model, known as \\"The Dark Spud\\", features Mr. Potato Head dressed up as the Caped Crusader. Before the release, the model was unveiled at the 2012 New York Toy Fair. In 2014, to celebrate The Simpsons 25th anniversary, there will be a Homer Simpson Mr. Potato Head.\\r\\nMr. Potato Head's popularity has led to some appearances in films and television. In 1985, Mr. Potato Head played a supporting role in Potato Head Kids, his first dramatic television appearance. In 1998ÿ1999, he had his own short-lived Fox Kids series, The Mr. Potato Head Show. In addition to film and television, the character has been the subject of a comic strip created by Jim Davis. Cartoonist Gary Larson included the character in several of his The Far Side cartoons. In commercial for Bridgestone tires during Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, Mr. Potato Head is driving a car and Mrs. Potato Head is nagging him.\\r\\nMr. Potato Head has also acted as spokesman for several causes. In 1987, Mr. Potato Head surrendered his pipe to become the spokesperson for the American Cancer Society's annual \\"Great American Smokeout\\" campaign. He performed the role for several years. In 1992, he received a special award from the President's Council for Physical Fitness. In 1996, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head joined the League of Women Voters and their \\"Get Out to Vote\\" campaign. Mr. Potato Head is also the inspiration/main character of an upcoming fan film, Potato Headed.\\r\\nLarger-than-life versions of Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head are \\"guests\\" in the 1980s section of Pop Century Resort at Walt Disney World in Florida.\\r\\nMr. and Mrs Potato Head also star in commercials for other brands starting in the 2000s. An example is an ad for Lay's Potato Chips where Mr. Potato Head comes home to see Mrs. Potato Head eating them despite being a potato herself. At the end Mr. Potato Head joins in and tells her to keep it their \\"little secret\\".\\r\\nA spoof, Mr. Zucchini Head, appears as a proposed new toy in the Family Guy episode \\"The King Is Dead\\". Another spoof, Mr. Carrot Head, appears in The Simpsons episode \\"Angry Dad: The Movie\\".\\r\\nPop singer Melanie Martinez released a song called \\"Mrs. Potato Head\\" on her debut album Cry Baby.\\r\\nMr. Potato Head (or Potato Head as he is sometimes referred to in the series) was also in the Disney/Pixar Toy Story films voiced by Don Rickles. He was one of Andy Davis's (John Morris) toys.\\r\\nIn the first film, Toy Story (1995), he is shown to be very moody towards Andy's other toys, although he's good friends with Hamm the piggy bank (John Ratzenberger). When Woody (Tom Hanks) accidentally pushes Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) out of window, Potato Head accuses Woody of doing it on purpose. When it is later revealed that Buzz is okay, Potato Head feels guilty about what he's done. At the end of the movie, he is overjoyed to hear Molly getting a Mrs. Potato Head on Christmas.\\r\\nIn the second film, Toy Story 2 (1999), he goes with Buzz, Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney) and Hamm to rescue Woody after he is stolen by Al McWhiggin (Wayne Knight). After he saves three Pizza Planet Aliens (Jeff Pidgeon) from falling out of a Pizza Planet truck, his wife, Mrs. Potato Head (Estelle Harris) adopts them, making her husband upset.\\r\\nIn the third film, Toy Story 3 (2010), he is one of Andy's remaining toys, alongside his wife, the aliens, Woody, Buzz, Rex, Hamm, Slinky (now voiced by Blake Clark), Jessie (Joan Cusack), and Bullseye. When the toys are donated to Sunnyside, Big Baby puts him in the box twice. After the aliens save Mr. Potato Head and the others from being killed in an incinerator with a giant crane, Potato Head finally accepts them as his sons. Finally, Potato Head and his friends end up at Bonnie Anderson's (Emily Hahn) house.\\r\\nHe will return in the fourth film Toy Story 4 (2019), where he, Buzz, and the others will help Woody find Bo Peep (Annie Potts). He will be voiced by a new actor in Toy Story 4 because of Rickles's death in 2017.[16]\\r\\nHe has also been in all three Toy Story Toons, Hawaiian Vacation (2011), Small Fry (2011) and Partysaurus Rex (2012), with Rickles reprising the role in the first and third shorts.\\r\\nHe also appeared in the Halloween special Toy Story of Terror! (2013), where he disappears and Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Rex, Mr. Pricklepants (Timothy Dalton) and Trixie (Kristen Schaal) must find him.\\r\\nHe was also in the Christmas special Toy Story That Time Forgot (2014), which is also Rickles' final time voicing the character.\\r\\nIn 1997, a computer game called \\"Mr. Potato Head's Activity Pack\\" was released by Hasbro Interactive, aimed at young children.\\r\\nMr. Potato Head has also appeared as the host in all installments of the popular video game series Hasbro Family Game Night. He has also appeared in several Toy Story based video games along with Toy Story Activity Center.","input":"What was the first toy advertised on tv in the usa?"},{"output":"The Philadelphia Badlands","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Philadelphia Badlands is a section of North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, that is known for an abundance of open-air recreational drug markets and drug-related violence.[1] It has amorphous and somewhat disputed boundaries, but is generally agreed to include the 25th police district.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nUsually, it is widely understood to be an area between Kensington Avenue to the east and Broad Street to the west, and between Hunting Park Avenue to the north and York Street to the south, mostly coinciding with the neighborhoods of Fairhill, Glenwood, Hunting Park, Harrowgate, Stanton, North Central, West Kensington,   Hartranft, and Kensington.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term The Badlands was popularized in part by the novel Third and Indiana by then Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Steve Lopez.[1] The neighborhood also was featured in several episodes of ABC's Nightline. The intersection of 3rd Street and Indiana Avenue was listed number two in a 2007 list of the city's top ten drug corners according to an article by Philadelphia Weekly reporter Steve Volk.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term Badlands was first used by Lt. John Gallo, who headed the East Division Narcotics Task Force. Its use spread, with many people attempting to take credit for the moniker. It was Gallo's work along with ASAC Billy Retton that worked about a dozen long-term investigations in the 25th and 26th Police Districts that preceded \\"Operation Sunrise\\". Open-air drug sales changed completely after this. Ted Koppel, Geraldo Rivera, 20-20 and 48 Hours all rode with Gallo at one time or another, and it was during this time that Gallo was able to make the name stick.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one time a center of heavy industry, much of the Badlands' urban landscape is now characterized by vacant warehouses and tightly-packed strips of brick row houses constructed for the working class of the neighborhood. Like most industrial cities, Philadelphia suffered economic decline following the movement of industry to developing countries and has suffered as a result.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Philadelphia Badlands contain a diverse mix of ethnicities. Puerto Ricans are the largest group,[4][5][6][7] but the area also contains large populations of Black Americans, Irish Americans, and Dominicans. The area encompasses El Centro de Oro, the heart of Philadelphia's Puerto Rican community.  Many drug users from surrounding upscale suburbs make the badlands their home and get stuck in the cycle of addiction which leads to homelessness.  The term \\"Badlands\\" sometimes refers to the area's high concentration of street gangs of various ethnicities, and its abundance of open-air drug dealing and heavy users of drugs, especially heroin and cocaine.[8] Although much of the area's crime stems from local neighborhood-based street gangs and the drug trade, larger, more organized gangs also operate in the area, including the Black Mafia, Latin Kings, and various motorcycle gangs.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from less-organized gang activity, the Badlands is also known as the founding location and current[when?] turf of the Irish-American organized crime group known as the K&A Gang (also known as the Northeast Philly Irish Mob). Circa 2012 Irish Americans constitute more than 12% of the population of the Badlands.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area's reputation has been countered by community activists and nonprofit organizations such as Centro Nueva Creaci܇n, which in 2010 conducted a summer children's program, \\"The Goodlands Photographers\\", aimed at helping young people photograph and display positive images of their neighborhood.[2]","input":"What is the most dangerous area in philadelphia?"},{"output":"Kalachuri dynasty","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nChausath Yogini Temple is one of the oldest heritage sites in India.

A Yogini is a female attendant of the mother goddess, who slays illusion with fiery passion through insight and liberation.[2] It is located near the river Narmada and the famous Marble Rocks in Bhedaghat, some 5?km from Jabalpur, Madhya pradesh.[3] Though the temple has been partially damaged, it speaks greatly of the ancient dynasties that ruled in Jabalpur.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temple was constructed during the reign of Kalachuri dynasty at 10th century and was mainly made with local granite.

This causes the term \\"polar ice cap\\" to be something of a misnomer, as the term ice cap itself is applied more narrowly to bodies that are over land, and cover less than 50,000?km2: larger bodies are referred to as ice sheets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe composition of the ice will vary. For example, Earth's polar caps are mainly water ice, whereas Mars's polar ice caps are a mixture of solid carbon dioxide and water ice.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolar ice caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy in the form of solar radiation from the Sun than equatorial regions, resulting in lower surface temperatures.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarth's polar caps have changed dramatically over the last 12,000 years. Seasonal variations of the ice caps takes place due to varied solar energy absorption as the planet or moon revolves around the Sun. Additionally, in geologic time scales, the ice caps may grow or shrink due to climate variation.\\r\\n\\r\\nExtent of the Arctic sea-ice in September 1978 ÿ 2002\\r\\n\\r\\nExtent of the Arctic sea-ice in February 1978 ÿ 2002\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blue Marble, Earth as seen from Apollo 17 with the southern polar ice cap visible (courtesy NASA)\\r\\n\\r\\nEarth's North Pole is covered by floating pack ice (sea ice) over the Arctic Ocean. Portions of the ice that do not melt seasonally can get very thick, up to 3ÿ4 meters thick over large areas, with ridges up to 20 meters thick.  One-year ice is usually about 1 meter thick.  The area covered by sea ice ranges between 9 and 12 million km2. In addition, the Greenland ice sheet covers about 1.71 million km2 and contains about 2.6 million km3 of ice. When the ice breaks off (calves) it forms icebergs scattered around the northern Atlantic.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, \\"since 1979, winter Arctic ice extent has decreased about 4.2 percent per decade\\". Both 2008 and 2009 had a minimum Arctic sea ice extent somewhat above that of 2007. At other times of the year the ice extent is still sometimes near the 1979ÿ2000 average, as in April 2010, by the data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center.[3]  Still, between these same years, the overall average ice coverage appears to have declined from 8 million km2 to 5 million km2.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarth's south polar land mass, Antarctica, is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet.  It covers an area of about 14.6 million km2 and contains between 25 and 30 million km3 of ice. Around 70% of the fresh water on Earth is contained in this ice sheet.\\r\\n\\r\\nData from the National Snow and Ice Data Center shows that the sea ice coverage of Antarctica has a slightly positive trend over the last three decades (1979ÿ2009).[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the past several decades, Earths polar ice caps have gained significant attention because of the alarming decrease in land and sea ice. NASA reports that since the late 1970s, the Arctic has lost an average of 20,800 square miles (53,900 square kilometers) of ice per year while the Antarctic has gained an average of 7,300 square miles (18,900 km2) of ice per year. On September 19, 2014, for the first time since 1979, Antarctic sea ice extent exceeded 7.72 million square miles (20 million square kilometers), according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The ice extent stayed above this benchmark extent for several days. The average maximum extent between 1981 and 2010 was 7.23 million square miles (18.72 million square kilometers). The single-day maximum extent in 2014 was reached on Sept. 20, according to NSIDC data, when the sea ice covered  7.78 million square miles (20.14 million square kilometers). The 2014 five-day average maximum was reached on Sept. 22, when sea ice covered 7.76 million square miles (20.11 million square kilometers), according to NSIDC.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current rate of decline of the ice caps has caused many investigations and discoveries on glacier dynamics and their influence on the worlds climate. In the early 1950s, scientists and engineers from the US Army began drilling into polar ice caps for geological insight. These studies resulted in nearly forty years of research experience and achievements in deep polar ice core drillings... and established the fundamental drilling technology for retrieving deep ice cores for climatologic archives. [6] Polar ice caps have been used to track current climate patterns but also patterns over the past several thousands years from the traces of CO2 and CH4 found trapped in the ice. In the past decade, polar ice caps have shown their most rapid decline in size with no true sign of recovery.[7] Josefino Comiso, a senior research scientist at NASA, found that the rate of warming in the Arctic over the last 20 years is eight times the rate of warming over the last 100 years.[8] In September 2012, sea ice reached its smallest size ever. Journalist John Vidal stated that sea ice is \\"700,000 sq km below the previous minimum of 4.17m sq km set in 2007\\".[9] In August 2013, Arctic sea ice extent averaged 6.09m km2, which represents 1.13 million km2 below the 1981ÿ2010 average for that month.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to Earth, the planet Mars also has polar ice caps.  They consist of primarily water-ice with a few percent dust.[11]  Frozen carbon dioxide makes up a small permanent portion of the Planum Australe or the South Polar Layered Deposits.  In both hemispheres a seasonal carbon dioxide frost deposits in the winter and sublimes during the spring.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nData collected in 2001 from NASA missions to Mars show that the southern residual ice cap undergoes sublimation inter-annually.  The most widely accepted explanation is that fluctuations in the planet's orbit are causing the changes.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 29, 2015, NASA stated that its New Horizons missions had discovered a feature thought to be a polar ice cap on the dwarf planet Pluto.[14] The probe's flyby of Pluto in July 2015 allowed the Alice ultraviolet imaging spectrometer to confirm that the feature was in fact an ice cap composed of methane and nitrogen ices.[15]","input":"How deep is the ice at the north pole?"},{"output":"Nathan Parsons","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seventh season of the American ABC fantasy-drama Once Upon a Time was ordered on May 11, 2017.[1] It consisted of 22 episodes, airing on Fridays, having premiered on October 6, 2017.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis season marked a significant change for the series, as it was announced at the end of the sixth season that the majority of the main cast members would not be returning for season 7.

It is also possible to store contact information on many SIM cards. SIM cards are always used on GSM phones; for CDMA phones, they are only needed for newer LTE-capable handsets. SIM cards can also be used in satellite phones, computers, or cameras.\\r\\nThe SIM circuit is part of the function of a universal integrated circuit card (UICC) physical smart card, which is usually made of PVC with embedded contacts and semiconductors. \\"SIM cards\\" are transferable between different mobile devices. The first UICC smart cards were the size of credit and bank cards; sizes were reduced several times over the years, usually keeping electrical contacts the same, so that a larger card could be cut down to a smaller size.\\r\\nA SIM card contains its unique serial number (ICCID), international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number, security authentication and ciphering information, temporary information related to the local network, a list of the services the user has access to, and two passwords: a personal identification number (PIN) for ordinary use, and a personal unblocking code (PUC) for PIN unlocking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SIM was initially specified by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute in the specification with the number TS 11.11. This specification describes the physical and logical behaviour of the SIM. With the development of UMTS, the specification work was partially transferred to 3GPP. 3GPP is now responsible for the further development of applications like SIM (TS 51.011[1]) and USIM (TS 31.102[2]) and ETSI for the further development of the physical card UICC.\\r\\nThe first SIM card was developed in 1991 by Munich smart-card maker Giesecke & Devrient, who sold the first 300 SIM cards to the Finnish wireless network operator Radiolinja.[3][4]\\r\\nToday, SIM cards are ubiquitous, allowing over 7 billion devices to connect to cellular networks around the world. According to the International Card Manufacturers Association (ICMA), there were 5.4 billion SIM cards manufactured globally in 2016 creating over $6.5 billion in revenue for traditional SIM card vendors.[5] The rise of cellular IoT and 5G networks is predicted to drive the growth of the addressable market for SIM card manufacturers to over 20 billion cellular devices by 2020.[6] The introduction of Embedded SIM (eSIM) and Remote SIM Provisioning (RSP) from the GSMA [7] may disrupt the traditional SIM card ecosystem with the entrance of new players specializing in \\"digital\\" SIM card provisioning and other value-added services for mobile network operators.\\r\\nMany non-contractual \\"pay-as-you-go\\" arrangements require the subscriber to actively use credit periodically to avoid account expiration, expiration period depends on network operators, typically defining a period from three months to one year. This is sometimes associated with the SIM card being made \\"inactive\\" by the network.[8]\\r\\nMost countries and operators require customer identification to activate service, but some, such as The United States, Hong Kong SAR, Lithuania and the Philippines, do not.\\r\\nThere are three operating voltages for SIM cards: 5 V, 3 V and 1.8 V (ISO/IEC 7816-3 classes A, B and C, respectively). The operating voltage of the majority of SIM cards launched before 1998 was 5 V. SIM cards produced subsequently are compatible with 3 V and 5 V. Modern cards support 5 V, 3 V and 1.8 V.\\r\\nModern SIM cards allow applications to load when the SIM is in use by the subscriber. These applications communicate with the handset or a server using SIM Application Toolkit, which was initially specified by 3GPP in TS 11.14. (There is an identical ETSI specification with different numbering.) ETSI and 3GPP maintain the SIM specifications. The main specifications are: ETSI TS 102 223, ETSI TS 102 241, ETSI TS 102 588, and ETSI TS 131 111. SIM toolkit applications were initially written in native code using proprietary APIs. To provide interoperability of the applications, ETSI chose Java Card.[citation needed]. Additional standard size and specifications of interest are maintained by GlobalPlatform.\\r\\nSIM cards store network-specific information used to authenticate and identify subscribers on the network. The most important of these are the ICCID, IMSI, Authentication Key (Ki), Local Area Identity (LAI) and Operator-Specific Emergency Number. The SIM also stores other carrier-specific data such as the SMSC (Short Message Service Center) number, Service Provider Name (SPN), Service Dialing Numbers (SDN), Advice-Of-Charge parameters and Value Added Service (VAS) applications. (Refer to GSM 11.11[9])\\r\\nSIM cards can come in various data capacities, from 8 KB to at least 256 KB. All can store a maximum of 250 contacts on the SIM, but while the 32 KB has room for 33 Mobile Network Codes (MNCs) or network identifiers, the 64 KB version has room for 80 MNCs.[citation needed] This is used by network operators to store data on preferred networks, mostly used when the SIM is not in its home network but is roaming. The network operator that issued the SIM card can use this to have a phone connect to a preferred network that is more economic for the provider instead of having to pay the network operator that the phone 'saw' first. This does not mean that a phone containing this SIM card can connect to a maximum of only 33 or 80 networks, but it means that the SIM card issuer can specify only up to that number of preferred networks. If a SIM is outside these preferred networks it uses the first or best available network.\\r\\nEach SIM is internationally identified by its integrated circuit card identifier (ICCID). ICCIDs are stored in the SIM cards and are also engraved or printed on the SIM card body during a process called personalisation. The ICCID is defined by the ITU-T recommendation E.118 as the Primary Account Number.[10] Its layout is based on ISO/IEC 7812. According to E.118, the number is up to 22 digits long, including a single check digit calculated using the Luhn algorithm. However, the GSM Phase 1[11] defined the ICCID length as 10 octets (20 digits) with operator-specific structure.\\r\\nThe number is composed of the following subparts:\\r\\nIssuer identification number (IIN)\\r\\nMaximum of seven digits:\\r\\nIndividual account identification\\r\\nCheck digit\\r\\nWith the GSM Phase 1 specification using 10 octets into which ICCID is stored as packed BCD, the data field has room for 20 digits with hexadecimal digit \\"F\\" being used as filler when necessary.\\r\\nIn practice, this means that on GSM SIM cards there are 20-digit (19+1) and 19-digit (18+1) ICCIDs in use, depending upon the issuer. However, a single issuer always uses the same size for its ICCIDs.\\r\\nTo confuse matters more, SIM factories seem to have varying ways of delivering electronic copies of SIM personalization datasets. Some datasets are without the ICCID checksum digit, others are with the digit.\\r\\nAs required by E.118, The ITU publishes a list of all current internationally assigned IIN codes in its Operational Bulletins.[12] As of October?2016[update] the list issued on 15 November 2013 was current.[13]\\r\\nSIM cards are identified on their individual operator networks by a unique International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). Mobile network operators connect mobile phone calls and communicate with their market SIM cards using their IMSIs. The format is:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ki is a 128-bit value used in authenticating the SIMs on a GSM mobile network (for USIM network, you still need Ki but other parameters are also needed). Each SIM holds a unique Ki assigned to it by the operator during the personalization process. The Ki is also stored in a database (termed authentication center or AuC) on the carrier's network.\\r\\nThe SIM card is designed to prevent someone from getting the Ki by using the smart-card interface. Instead, the SIM card provides a function, Run GSM Algorithm, that the phone uses to pass data to the SIM card to be signed with the Ki. This, by design, makes using the SIM card mandatory unless the Ki can be extracted from the SIM card, or the carrier is willing to reveal the Ki. In practice, the GSM cryptographic algorithm for computing SRES_2 (see step 4, below) from the Ki has certain vulnerabilities[14] that can allow the extraction of the Ki from a SIM card and the making of a duplicate SIM card.\\r\\nAuthentication process:\\r\\nThe SIM stores network state information, which is received from the Location Area Identity (LAI). Operator networks are divided into Location Areas, each having a unique LAI number. When the device changes locations, it stores the new LAI to the SIM and sends it back to the operator network with its new location. If the device is power cycled, it takes data off the SIM, and searches for the prior LAI.\\r\\nMost SIM cards store a number of SMS messages and phone book contacts. It stores the contacts in simple \\"name and number\\" pairs. Entries that contain multiple phone numbers and additional phone numbers are usually not stored on the SIM card. When a user tries to copy such entries to a SIM, the handset's software breaks them into multiple entries, discarding information that is not a phone number. The number of contacts and messages stored depends on the SIM; early models stored as few as five messages and 20 contacts, while modern SIM cards can usually store over 250 contacts.[citation needed]\\r\\nSIM cards have been made smaller over the years; functionality is independent of format. Full-size SIM were followed by mini-SIM, micro-SIM, and nano-SIM. SIM cards are also made to embed in devices.\\r\\nThe full-size SIM (or 1FF, 1st form factor) was the first form factor to appear. It has the size of a credit card (85.60?mm G 53.98?mm G 0.76?mm). Later smaller SIMs are often supplied embedded in a full-size card that they can be pushed out of.\\r\\nThe mini-SIM (or 2FF) card has the same contact arrangement as the full-size SIM card and is normally supplied within a full-size card carrier, attached by a number of linking pieces. This arrangement (defined in ISO/IEC 7810 as ID-1/000) lets such a card be used in a device that requires a full-size card?ÿ  or in a device that requires a mini-SIM card, after breaking the linking pieces. As the full-size SIM is no longer used, some suppliers refer to the mini-SIM as a \\"standard SIM\\" or \\"regular SIM\\".\\r\\nThe micro-SIM (or 3FF) card has the same thickness and contact arrangements, but reduced length and width as shown in the table above.[15]\\r\\nThe micro-SIM was introduced by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) along with SCP, 3GPP (UTRAN/GERAN), 3GPP2 (CDMA2000), ARIB, GSM Association (GSMA SCaG and GSMNA), GlobalPlatform, Liberty Alliance, and the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) for the purpose of fitting into devices too small for a mini-SIM card.[16][17]\\r\\nThe form factor was mentioned in the December 1998 3GPP SMG9 UMTS Working Party, which is the standards-setting body for GSM SIM cards,[18] and the form factor was agreed upon in late 2003.[19]\\r\\nThe micro-SIM was designed for backward compatibility. The major issue for backward compatibility was the contact area of the chip. Retaining the same contact area makes the micro-SIM compatible with the prior, larger SIM readers through the use of plastic cutout surrounds. The SIM was also designed to run at the same speed (5?MHz) as the prior version. The same size and positions of pins resulted in numerous \\"How-to\\" tutorials and YouTube video with detailed instructions how to cut a mini-SIM card to micro-SIM size.[20]\\r\\nThe chairman of EP SCP, Dr. Klaus Vedder, said[19]\\r\\nMicro-SIM cards were introduced by various mobile service providers for the launch of the original iPad, and later for smartphones, from April 2010. The iPhone 4 was the first smartphone to use a micro-SIM card in June 2010, followed by many others.\\r\\nThe nano-SIM (or 4FF) card was introduced on 11 October 2012, when mobile service providers in various countries started to supply it for phones that supported the format. The nano-SIM measures 12.3?G?8.8?G?0.67?mm and reduces the previous format to the contact area while maintaining the existing contact arrangements. A small rim of isolating material is left around the contact area to avoid short circuits with the socket. The nano-SIM is 0.67?mm thick, compared to the 0.76?mm of its predecessor. 4FF can be put into adapters for use with devices designed for 2FF or 3FF SIMs, and is made thinner for that purpose,[21] but many phone companies do not recommend this.[22][not in citation given]\\r\\nThe iPhone 5, released in September 2012, was the first device to use a nano-SIM card, followed by other handsets.\\r\\nAn upcoming new type of SIM is called e-SIM or eSIM (embedded SIM). It is a non-replaceable embedded chip in SON-8 package that is soldered directly onto a circuit board. It has M2M and remote SIM provisioning capabilities.\\r\\nThe surface mount format provides the same electrical interface as the full size, 2FF and 3FF SIM cards, but is soldered to the circuit board as part of the manufacturing process. In M2M applications where there is no requirement to change the SIM card, this avoids the requirement for a connector, improving reliability and security. GSMA has been discussing the possibilities of a software based SIM card since 2010.[23] While Motorola noted that eUICC is geared at industrial devices, Apple \\"disagreed that there is any statement forbidding the use of an embedded UICC in a consumer product.\\" in 2012,[24] The European Commission has selected the Embedded UICC format for its in-vehicle emergency call service known as eCall. All new car models in the EU must have one by 2018 to instantly connect the car to the emergency services in case of an accident. Russia has a similar plan with the ERA-GLONASS regional satellite positioning system.[25]\\r\\nIn July 2013, Karsten Nohl, a security researcher from SRLabs, described[26][27] vulnerabilities in some SIM cards that supported DES, which, despite its age, is still used by some operators.[27] The attack could lead to the phone being remotely cloned or let someone steal payment credentials from the SIM.[27] Further details of the research were provided at BlackHat on July 31, 2013.[27][28]\\r\\nIn response, the International Telecommunication Union said that the development was \\"hugely significant\\" and that it would be contacting its members.[29]\\r\\nIn February 2015, it was reported by The Intercept that the NSA and GCHQ had stolen the encryption keys (Ki's) used by Gemalto (the manufacturer of 2 billion SIM cards annually), enabling these intelligence agencies to monitor voice and data communications without the knowledge or approval of cellular network providers or judicial oversight.[30] Having finished its investigation, Gemalto claimed that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the NSA and GCHQ carried out an operation to hack its network in 2010 and 2011, but says the number of possibly stolen keys would not have been massive.[31]\\r\\nWhen GSM was already in use, the specifications were further developed and enhanced with functionality such as SMS and GPRS. These development steps are referred as releases by ETSI. Within these development cycles, the SIM specification was enhanced as well: new voltage classes, formats and files were introduced.\\r\\nIn GSM-only times, the SIM consisted of the hardware and the software. With the advent of UMTS this naming was split: the SIM was now an application and hence only software. The hardware part was called UICC. This split was necessary because UMTS introduced a new application, the universal subscriber identity module (USIM). The USIM brought, among other things, security improvements like the mutual authentication and longer encryption keys and an improved address book.\\r\\n\\"SIM cards\\" in developed countries are today usually UICCs containing at least a SIM and a USIM application. This configuration is necessary because older GSM only handsets are solely compatible with the SIM [application] and some UMTS security enhancements do rely on the USIM [application].\\r\\nThe equivalent of SIM on CDMA networks is the R-UIM (and the equivalent of USIM is CSIM).\\r\\nA virtual SIM is a mobile phone number provided by a mobile network operator that does not require a SIM card to connect phone calls to a user's mobile phone.\\r\\nAt the 2015 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Simless, Inc., a US-based startup unveiled world's first GSM phone without a SIM card slot. The reference phone was capable of downloading multiple virtual SIM cards over-the-air.[32]\\r\\nThe use of SIM cards is mandatory in GSM devices.\\r\\nThe satellite phone networks Iridium, Thuraya and Inmarsat's BGAN also use SIM cards. Sometimes, these SIM cards work in regular GSM phones and also allow GSM customers to roam in satellite networks by using their own SIM card in a satellite phone.\\r\\nJapan's 2G PDC system (which was shut down in 2012; SoftBank Mobile has already shut down PDC from March 31, 2010) also specifies a SIM, but this has never been implemented commercially. The specification of the interface between the Mobile Equipment and the SIM is given in the RCR STD-27 annex 4. The Subscriber Identity Module Expert Group was a committee of specialists assembled by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to draw up the specifications (GSM 11.11) for interfacing between smart cards and mobile telephones. In 1994, the name SIMEG was changed to SMG9.\\r\\nJapan's current and next generation cellular systems are based on W-CDMA (UMTS) and CDMA2000 and all use SIM cards. However, Japanese CDMA2000-based phones are locked to the R-UIM they are associated with and thus, the cards are not interchangeable with other Japanese CDMA2000 handsets (though they may be inserted into GSM/WCDMA handsets for roaming purposes outside Japan).\\r\\nCDMA-based devices originally did not use a removable card, and the service for these phones bound to a unique identifier contained in the handset itself. This is most prevalent in operators in the Americas. The first publication of the TIA-820 standard (also known as 3GPP2 C.S0023) in 2000 defined the Removable User Identity Module (R-UIM). Card-based CDMA devices are most prevalent in Asia.\\r\\nThe equivalent of a SIM in UMTS is called the universal integrated circuit card (UICC), which runs a USIM application. The UICC is still colloquially called a SIM card.[citation needed]\\r\\nSIM card for Thuraya satellite phone\\r\\nKDDI's au IC-Card\\r\\nNTT DoCoMo's FOMA Card\\r\\nUMTS modem with Beeline's SIM card\\r\\nSIM card and the mobile phone\\r\\nThree UK SIM Card with Packaging\\r\\nChunghwa Telecom's LTE Card\\r\\nChina Mobile's LTE SIM card\\r\\nH2O Wireless prepaid SIM card\\r\\nHotlink (Maxis) nano-SIM card\\r\\nDual SIM slots as shown on Chinese cell phone\\r\\nDeutsche Telekom nano-SIM Card with NFC capabilities in the SIM tray of an iPhone 6s\\r\\nDeutsche Telekom Mini-SIM with pre-cut Micro- and Nano-SIM\\r\\nThe SIM card introduced a new and significant business opportunity for MVNOs?ÿ  mobile virtual network operators?ÿ  who lease capacity from one of the network operators rather than owning or operating a cellular telecoms network, and only provide a SIM card to their customers. MVNOs first appeared in Denmark, Hong Kong, Finland and the UK. Today they exist in over 50 countries, including most of Europe, United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia and parts of Asia, and account for approximately 10% of all mobile phone subscribers around the world.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn some networks, the mobile phone is locked to its carrier SIM card, meaning that the phone only works with SIM cards from the specific carrier. This is more common in markets where mobile phones are heavily subsidised by the carriers, and the business model depends on the customer staying with the service provider for a minimum term (typically 12, 18 or 24 months). SIM cards that are issued by providers with an associated contract are called SIM-only deals. Common examples are the GSM networks in the United States, Canada, Australia, the UK and Poland. Many businesses offer the ability to remove the SIM lock from a phone, effectively making it possible to then use the phone on any network by inserting a different SIM card. Mostly, GSM and 3G mobile handsets can easily be unlocked and used on any suitable network with any SIM card.\\r\\nIn countries where the phones are not subsidised, e.g., India, Israel and Belgium, all phones are unlocked. Where the phone is not locked to its SIM card, the users can easily switch networks by simply replacing the SIM card of one network with that of another while using only one phone. This is typical, for example, among users who may want to optimise their carrier's traffic by different tariffs to different friends on different networks, or when traveling internationally.\\r\\nIn 2016, carriers started using the concept of automatic SIM reactivation[33] whereby they let users reuse expired SIM cards instead of purchasing new ones when they wish to re-subscribe to that operator. This is particularly useful in countries where prepaid calls dominate and where competition drives high churn rates, as users had to return to a carrier shop to purchase a new SIM each time they wanted to churn back to an operator.\\r\\nCommonly sold as a product by mobile telecommunications companies, \\"SIM-only\\" refers to a type of legally binding contract between a mobile network provider and a customer. The contract itself takes the form of a credit agreement and is subject to a credit check.\\r\\nWithin a SIM-only contract the mobile network provider supplies their customer with just one piece of hardware, a SIM card, which includes an agreed amount of network usage in exchange for a monthly payment. Network usage within a SIM-only contract can be measured in minutes, text, data or any combination of these. The duration of a SIM-only contract varies depending on the deal selected by the customer, but in the UK they are available over 1, 3, 6, and 12 month periods.\\r\\nSIM-only contracts differ from mobile phone contracts in that they do not include any hardware other than a SIM card. In terms of network usage, SIM-only is typically more cost effective than other contracts because the provider does not charge more to offset the cost of a mobile device over the contract period. Short contract length is one of the key features of SIM-only?ÿ  made possible by the absence of a mobile device.\\r\\nSIM-only is increasing in popularity very quickly.[34] In 2010 pay monthly based mobile phone subscriptions grew from 41 percent to 49 percent of all UK mobile phone subscriptions.[35] According to German research company Gfk, 250,000 SIM-only mobile contracts were taken up in the UK during July 2012 alone, the highest figure since GfK began keeping records.\\r\\nIncreasing smartphone penetration combined with financial concerns are leading customers to save money by moving onto a SIM-only when their initial contract term is over.\\r\\nDevices with two SIM slots are known as dual SIMs. Dual-SIM mobile phones usually come with two slots for SIMs, one behind the battery and another on the side of the phone, though in some devices both slots can be found on the battery tray, or on the side of the phone if the device does not have a removable battery. Multiple-SIM devices are commonplace in developing markets such as in Africa, East Asia, the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, where billing rates and variable network coverage/mode, make it desirable for consumers to use multiple SIMs from competing networks. It's also useful when you split work and home number for better privacy. They are not common in the Western world.","input":"What does the s stand for in sim?"},{"output":"cold-water fish","context":"Lake Simcoe is a lake in southern Ontario, Canada, the fourth-largest lake wholly in the province, after Lake Nipigon, Lac Seul, and Lake Nipissing.[6] At the time of the first European contact in the 17th century the lake was called Ouentironk (\\"Beautiful Water\\") by the Wyandot (Huron) people. It was also known as Lake Toronto until it was renamed by John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, in memory of his father, Captain John Simcoe, Royal Navy.\\r\\nThe lake is bordered by Simcoe County, Durham Region, and York Region. The city of Barrie is located on Kempenfelt Bay, and Orillia is located at the entrance to Lake Couchiching. The watershed draining into the lake contains a population of roughly half a million people, including the northern portion of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).\\r\\nThe town of Georgina lies along the entire south shore of Lake Simcoe and consists of smaller residential towns and communities, including Keswick on Cook's Bay, Sutton, Jackson's Point, Pefferlaw, and Udora.\\r\\nThe town of Innisfil occupies the western shore south of Barrie and north of Bradford.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLake Simcoe is a remnant of a much bigger, prehistoric lake known as Lake Algonquin. This lake's basin also included Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, Lake Nipigon, and Lake Nipissing. The melting of an ice dam at the close of the last ice age greatly reduced water levels in the region, leaving the lakes of today.\\r\\nAt the time of the first European contact in the 17th century, the lake was called Ouentironk (\\"Beautiful Water\\") by the Wyandot (Huron) natives. In 1687, Lahontan called it Lake Taronto, an Iroquoian term meaning gateway or pass; Taronto had originally referred to The Narrows, a channel of water through which Lake Simcoe discharges into Lake Couchiching. (Natural Resources Canada gives a related translation: \\"it originated as the Mohawk phrase tkaronto, which means \\"where there are trees standing in the water\\". According to several Mohawk speakers and aboriginal language expert John Steckley. Mohawks used the phrase to describe The Narrows, where Hurons and other natives drove stakes into the water to create fish weirs. Radiocarbon dating of surviving stakes reveals that the weirs at The Narrows were in use more than 4,000 years ago.\\") Since then, many subsequent mapmakers adopted this name for it, though cartographer Vincenzo Coronelli is thought to have introduced the more commonly used spelling of Toronto in a map he created in 1695.[7]\\r\\nThe name 'Toronto' found its way to the current city through its use in the name for the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail (or Toronto Passage), a portage running between Lake Ontario and Georgian Bay, that passed through Lake Toronto, which in turn was used as the name for an early French fort located at the foot of the Toronto Passage, on Lake Ontario. The Severn River, its outlet stream, was once called 'Rivire de Toronto' which flows into Georgian Bay's Severn Sound, then called the 'Baie de Toronto'.\\r\\nThe later French traders referred to it as Lac aux Claies, meaning \\"Lake of Grids (or Trellises)\\" in reference to the Huron fishing weirs in the lake.\\r\\nIt was renamed by John Graves Simcoe in 1793 in memory of his father, Captain John Simcoe. Captain Simcoe was born on 28 November 1710, in Staindrop, in County Durham, northeast England and served as an officer in the Royal Navy, dying of pneumonia aboard his ship, HMS Pembroke, on 15 May 1759.[8]\\r\\nThe lake is about 30 kilometres (19?mi) long, 25 kilometres (16?mi) wide and 722 square kilometres (279?sq?mi) in area.[2] It is shaped somewhat like a fist with the index finger and thumb extended. The thumb forms Kempenfelt Bay on the west, the wrist Lake Couchiching to the north, and the extended finger is Cook's Bay on the south. Couchiching was at one time thought of as a third bay of Simcoe, known as the Bristol Channel; however, the narrows between the two bodies of water separate them enough to consider this to be another lake. The narrows, known as \\"where trees stand in the water\\", an interpretation of the word 'Toronto', was an important fishing point for the First Nations peoples who lived in the area, and the Mohawk term toran-ten eventually gave its name to Toronto by way of the portage route running south from that point, the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail.\\r\\nRegarding the translation of 'Toronto' as meaning \\"where trees stand in the water\\", this would have been the likely outcome of the Huron practise of driving stakes into the channel sediments to corral fish. Fresh-cut saplings placed in the water and sediments would have sprouted branches and leaves, persisting for some time, leading to a place \\"where trees stand in the water\\".\\r\\nA number of southern Ontario rivers flow, generally north, into the lake, draining 2,581?km2 (997?sq?mi) of land. From the east, the Talbot River, part of the Trent-Severn Waterway is the most important river draining into Lake Simcoe, connecting the lake with the Kawartha lakes system and Lake Ontario. From its connection to Lake Couchiching, the Severn River is the only drainage from the lake to Georgian Bay, part of Lake Huron (Simcoe itself is not one of the Great Lakes). The canal locks of the Trent-Severn Waterway make this connection navigable.\\r\\nA number of creeks and rivers flow into the lake:\\r\\nLake Simcoe contains a large island, Georgina, which along with Snake Island and Fox Island forms the reserve of the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation. The lake is dotted with several smaller islands, including Thorah Island (a cottage destination), Strawberry Island (a Basilian retreat), Snake Island, and Fox Island. Pope John Paul II stayed on Strawberry Island for four days just before World Youth Day 2002 in Toronto.[9] Before the completion of the Trent Severn Waterway, the water level on Lake Simcoe was quite low enabling residents to cross in wagons or walk in ankle deep water to the mainland. However, when it was completed, the water table increased by several feet.\\r\\nThe lake has little commercial activity, but sees many recreational uses. In the winter, it freezes over completely and hosts a number of ice fishing competitions, making it one of the most intensely fished lakes in Ontario. However, claims that it is one of the world's largest lakes that freeze over completely in winter are pure speculation, and, in fact, spurious; Canada alone has a large number lakes of the same size or larger that do the same.\\r\\nIn the summer, fishing is still an attraction; however, there are also a number of poker runs, jet-skiing, and other boating events. The lake is surrounded with summer cottages leading heavy recreational and boating use in summer.\\r\\nThere are a number of beaches which attract visitors from the GTA as Lake Simcoe has a reputation for cleaner and warmer water than the GTA's Lake Ontario beaches. Many of the beaches are used for kite surfing as well. Willow Beach in Georgina on the south shore is one of the largest and most popular public beaches on Lake Simcoe.\\r\\nThere are seven yacht clubs (sailing) around the lake, which host a number of regattas, and an active sailing community exists on the lake.\\r\\nThe lake also forms part of the Trent-Severn Waterway system that links Lake Ontario and Georgian Bay/Lake Huron.\\r\\nLake Simcoe is also well known for its scuba diving. The shipwreck \\"J.C.Morrison\\" sank in 1857 and is a great dive site off centennial beach. There are also a number of other popular scuba diving entrance points popular among fresh water divers. Kempenfelt Bay is the most popular for scuba divers as it is the deepest. Visibility ranges from over 30 feet to near none.\\r\\nWhen a lake is healthy, cold-water fish such as lake trout, herring, and whitefish are abundant and active.[10] It is sometimes known as Canada's ice fishing capital.\\r\\nThe lake is located on Paleozoic limestone of the Ordovician period. However, due to deep deposits of glacial sediments, this bedrock only appears exposed along the lakeshore on Georgina Island. This rock, however, also appears along the shore of Lake Couchiching, where sediments are thinner. The outlet of the lake at the north end of Lake Couchiching is controlled by Precambrian bedrock which first makes its appearance about mid-way along this lake. As a result, the lake has persisted to the present, with the outlet-flow unable to cut down through the rock, and thereby draining the lake. This is unlike its one-time smaller sister-lake of 'Lake Minesing' to the west, being a remnant of Lake Algonquin, and, later the Nipissing stage of Lake Huron. This lake's outlet was founded on sediments located near Edenvale, which have largely been cut through, draining most of the lake. Today 'Lake Minesing' exists as the Minesing Swamp, but it re-establishes itself for a short period each spring when spring run-off floods the basin.\\r\\nIsostatic rebound from the retreat of the last glaciers results in a steady rise of Lake Simcoe, particularly at its south end, and is further responsible for the deep organic sediments that have accumulated in its one-time shallow southern arm, known as the Holland Marsh. Here, organic deposits created by vegetation have largely kept pace with the steady rise in water level, and today supports extensive market gardening. All rivers, and most streams, flowing into the lake have wide, deep, navigable mouths as a consequence of the rising waters drowning the river channels.\\r\\n2017 data for the year prior from the NOAA shows the lake has a yearly average surface temperature of 2.5 degrees Celsius. [11]\\r\\nLake Simcoe has been victim to significant eutrophication. Lake Simcoe has seen a dramatic decline in some fish species, along with an increase in algae blooms and aquatic weed growth. Phosphorus emissions from both urban and rural sources have upset the lake's ecosystem and fostered excessive aquatic plant growth, raising water temperatures, and decreasing oxygen levels, thereby rendering limited breeding grounds inhospitable.\\r\\nLake Simcoe has been victim to zebra mussel, purple loosestrife, black crappie, spiny water flea, round goby, rusty crayfish and Eurasian milfoil invasions.[10][12][13][14]\\r\\nThe zebra mussel, which arrived in North American waters in 1985, originated in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea area and is thought to have been brought to North America in the ballast of foreign freighters. Zebra mussels are particularly harmful to Lake Simcoe because they increase the clarity of the water allowing sunlight to penetrate to the bottom of the lake, where more algae and aquatic weeds can grow, accelerating the eutrophication process.[10]\\r\\nThe Rainbow Smelt are another introduced species and they were first observed in the early 1960s. They were believed to compete with native Lake Whitefish and be somewhat responsible for a decline in their populations.[13]\\r\\nSeveral initiatives, such as the Lake Simcoe Environmental Management Strategy (LSEMS), the Lake Simcoe Conservation Foundation, and the Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority, are making efforts to rectify some of the lake's environmental woes. A local activist group, The Ladies of the Lake, are using the $250,000 they raised from the sale of a nude picture calendar to rally government, business, the school system, and the local citizenry to rescue the lake. Several towns and communities on the lakeshore depend on Lake Simcoe for their drinking water.\\r\\nDespite its delicate ecological balance, and its recovering freshwater fishery, the Region of York is currently finalizing plans for a large capacity sewage treatment plant[15] to be located on the Holland River in Cook's Bay. This plant's purpose is to support intensification of development in the Lake Simcoe watershed.\\r\\nOntario Provincial Police, South Simcoe Police, York Regional Police, Durham Regional Police, and Barrie Police have marine units that patrol on the waters of the lake.","input":"What types of fish are in lake simcoe?"},{"output":"3,890","context":"There are 50[1] tiger reserves in India[2] which are governed by Project Tiger which is administrated by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA).

This exhaustive study indicated that better protected tiger source sites, especially tiger reserves, have maintained viable populations. However, the area occupied by tigers outside protected areas has decreased considerably. This demonstrates the need for corridors in order for tigers to move between source sites. The existing tiger reserves represent around one-third of India's high density forest area.[6] More tigers were killed in the first quarter of 2016 than in the entire previous year. This significant revelation comes at a time when the tiger census numbers are disputed by the scientific community.

It is the home of two professional sports teams: the San Antonio Spurs (National Basketball Association), and the San Antonio Rampage (American Hockey League).\\r\\nThe arena seats 18,418 for basketball, 16,151 for ice hockey, and 19,000 for concerts or gatherings, and contains 2,018 club seats, 50 luxury suites and 32 bathrooms. It was opened in 2002 as the SBC Center, at a cost of US$175 million, financed by county-issued bonds, which were supported by a hotel-occupancy and car-rental tax increase and an additional contribution of $28.5 million from the Spurs.[6] SBC Communications, Inc., purchased the naming rights to the facility under a 20-year, $41 million naming rights agreement with Bexar County, the San Antonio Spurs, and the San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo in July 2000. SBC Communications changed its name to AT&T Inc. in November 2005. The arena officially changed its name to AT&T Center in January 2006.[7]\\r\\nFrom 2003 to 2017 the arena was home to the San Antonio Stars of the Women's National Basketball Association.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously, the Spurs played at the Alamodome, a multi-purpose facility with a configuration that allowed half the floor space to be used for basketball. Although the Alamodome was still relatively new (opening in 1993), it had become clear over the years that the Spurs were using it for most of the year, making it difficult to schedule contiguous dates for conventions or even a regular-season football schedule. The Alamodome's seating capacity could be expanded to 35,000 for popular regular-season opponents, and attracted nearly 40,000 for a 1999 NBA Finals game. Although it had been designed with the Spurs in mind, the Spurs and their fans grew increasingly dissatisfied with the facility because of its poor sight lines and cavernous feel. The Alamodome's basketball configuration had the basketball court at one end of where the football field would have been, leaving almost half of the stadium curtained off. Being primarily a football stadium differentiated the Alamodome from most other NBA facilities, including the Spurs' previous home, HemisFair Arena.\\r\\nAdditionally, since the Alamodome opened, there had been a plethora of new arena construction including facilities such as Conseco Fieldhouse (now Bankers Life Fieldhouse), which, in addition to offering an intimate atmosphere, offered teams several new revenue generating opportunities, including suites located on the lower levels and large club level seating areas.\\r\\nThe Spurs campaigned for several years for a new facility. The Spurs and the city had come to an agreement to build a new facility adjacent to the Alamodome, but in a last-minute reversal, the team partnered with Bexar County to construct a new arena adjacent to the Freeman Coliseum. As a part of the agreement, the facility would be home to the Spurs, a new ice hockey team (what became the Rampage), and the San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo event.\\r\\nThe facility would be funded through an increase of hotel and car rental taxes, and Bexar County voters approved the plan in November 1999. Coincidentally, the election was held on the same day the Spurs received their NBA Championship rings for their first NBA championship.\\r\\nRick Pych is the Chief Development Officer of the AT&T Center and led the Spurs franchise through its development, construction and opening in 2002.\\r\\nUnlike most arenas that can accommodate basketball and ice hockey, AT&T Center was primarily designed for basketball. Nevertheless, it can accommodate an NHL-sized ice hockey rink, but it can only accommodate a maximum of 16,151 people for ice hockey since the seating arrangement for ice hockey is asymmetrical. There are only a few permanent rows of seating on the lower level of the west end, and all of the upper-level sets on the west end of the arena have obstructed views. This would result in poor sightlines. However, the seating capacity for Rampage games is under 7,000 people, making the upper level not necessary for those events.\\r\\nIn 2012, the Rampage renamed the press box to the \\"Jessica Redfield Press Box\\" after Jessica Redfield, an aspiring news broadcaster and a former team intern who was killed in the Aurora theater shooting.[8]\\r\\nAfter the arena referendum passed, planning quickly began for construction on the new facility. Naming rights were obtained in July 2000 when an agreement was reached with San Antonio-based SBC Communications to name the new arena the SBC Center. The agreement was reported to be for a total of $41 million over 20 years.\\r\\nGround was officially broken on the facility in August 2000. The arena's basic design was similar to many of the other newer arenas in the NBA, thanks to the choice of Minneapolis-based Ellerbe Becket as the primary architects. A nationally recognized, local architecture firm, Lake/Flato, was teamed with Ellerbe Becket to work on the design of the structure. Lake/Flato is responsible for introducing a South Texas vernacular to the overall look of the arena. Ellerbe Becket was responsible for Bankers Life Fieldhouse (Indianapolis) design as well as Capital One Arena (Washington, D.C.).\\r\\nOn December 9, 2014 the Bexar County Commissioners Court gave Spurs Sports and Entertainment permission to begin up to $101.5 million in renovations to the AT&T Center.[9]\\r\\nThe renovations started in the summer of 2015 when the San Antonio Spurs ended the 2015 season. They are planned to include a new scoreboard, updated televisions inside and outside of the arena, a new state of the art sound system, and improved wifi that will cover about 90% of the venue. Expansions to the fan shop and other major parts of the AT&T Center are also in the plans. The renovations were funded by a 2008 tax increase for improvements to the Tobin Center, parts of the Mission Reach expansion, and the rodeo grounds located next to the AT&T Center.[10]\\r\\nIn addition to many local community and sporting events, the center hosts San Antonio Sports Car Association autocross competitions in the parking lot each month.\\r\\nThe Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association holds the San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo and an Xtreme Bulls tour event annually there.

The fire caused the deaths of 146 garment workers ÿ 123 women and 23 men[1] ÿ who died from the fire, smoke inhalation, or falling or jumping to their deaths. Most of the victims were recent Italian and Jewish immigrant women aged 16 to 23;[2][3][4] of the victims whose ages are known, the oldest victim was Providenza Panno at 43, and the youngest were 14-year-olds Kate Leone and \\"Sara\\" Rosaria Maltese.[5]\\r\\nThe factory was located on the eighth, ninth and tenth floors of the Asch Building, at 23ÿ29 Washington Place in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan. The 1901 building still stands today and is known as the Brown Building. It is part of and owned by New York University.[6]\\r\\nBecause the owners had locked the doors to the stairwells and exits ÿ a then-common practice to prevent workers from taking unauthorized breaks and to reduce theft[7] ÿ many of the workers who could not escape from the burning building simply jumped from the high windows. The fire led to legislation requiring improved factory safety standards and helped spur the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), which fought for better working conditions for sweatshop workers.\\r\\nThe building has been designated a National Historic Landmark and a New York City landmark.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Triangle Waist Company[9] factory occupied the eighth, ninth, and tenth floors of the 10-story Asch Building on the northwest corner of Greene Street and Washington Place, just east of Washington Square Park, in the Greenwich Village area of New York City. Under the ownership of Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, the factory produced women's blouses, known as \\"shirtwaists.\\" The factory normally employed about 500 workers, mostly young immigrant women, who worked nine hours a day on weekdays plus seven hours on Saturdays,[10] earning for their 52 hours of work between $7 and $12 a week,[7] the equivalent of $171 to $293 a week in 2016 currency, or $3.20 to $5.50 per hour.[11]\\r\\nAs the workday was ending on the afternoon of Saturday, March 25, 1911, a fire flared up at approximately 4:40 PM in a scrap bin under one of the cutter's tables at the northeast corner of the eighth floor.[12] The first fire alarm was sent at 4:45 PM by a passerby on Washington Place who saw smoke coming from the eighth floor.[13] Both owners of the factory were in attendance and had invited their children to the factory on that afternoon.[14] The Fire Marshal concluded that the likely cause of the fire was the disposal of an unextinguished match or cigarette butt in the scrap bin, which held two months' worth of accumulated cuttings by the time of the fire.[15] Beneath the table in the wooden bin were hundreds of pounds of scraps which were left over from the several thousand shirtwaists that had been cut at that table. The scraps piled up from the last time the bin was emptied, coupled with the hanging fabrics that surrounded it; the steel trim was the only thing that was not highly flammable.[12] Although smoking was banned in the factory, cutters were known to sneak cigarettes, exhaling the smoke through their lapels to avoid detection.[16] A New York Times article suggested that the fire may have been started by the engines running the sewing machines. A series of articles in Collier's noted a pattern of arson among certain sectors of the garment industry whenever their particular product fell out of fashion or had excess inventory in order to collect insurance. The Insurance Monitor, a leading industry journal, observed that shirtwaists had recently fallen out of fashion, and that insurance for manufacturers of them was \\"fairly saturated with moral hazard.\\" Although Blanck and Harris were known for having had four previous suspicious fires at their companies, arson was not suspected in this case.[14]\\r\\nA bookkeeper on the eighth floor was able to warn employees on the tenth floor via telephone, but there was no audible alarm and no way to contact staff on the ninth floor.[17] According to survivor Yetta Lubitz, the first warning of the fire on the ninth floor arrived at the same time as the fire itself.[18] Although the floor had a number of exits, including two freight elevators, a fire escape, and stairways down to Greene Street and Washington Place, flames prevented workers from descending the Greene Street stairway, and the door to the Washington Place stairway was locked to prevent theft by the workers; the locked doors allowed managers to check the women's purses.[19] The foreman who held the stairway door key had already escaped by another route.[20] Dozens of employees escaped the fire by going up the Greene Street stairway to the roof. Other survivors were able to jam themselves into the elevators while they continued to operate.[21]\\r\\nWithin three minutes, the Greene Street stairway became unusable in both directions.[22] Terrified employees crowded onto the single exterior fire escape, which city officials had allowed Asch to erect instead of the required third staircase.[12] It was a flimsy and poorly anchored iron structure which may have been broken before the fire. It soon twisted and collapsed from the heat and overload, spilling about 20 victims nearly 100 feet (30?m) to their deaths on the concrete pavement below. Elevator operators Joseph Zito[23] and Gaspar Mortillalo saved many lives by traveling three times up to the ninth floor for passengers, but Mortillalo was eventually forced to give up when the rails of his elevator buckled under the heat. Some victims pried the elevator doors open and jumped into the empty shaft, trying to slide down the cables or to land on top of the car. The weight and impacts of these bodies warped the elevator car and made it impossible for Zito to make another attempt. William Gunn Shepard, a reporter at the tragedy, would say that \\"I learned a new sound that day, a sound more horrible than description can picture -- the thud of a speeding living body on a stone sidewalk\\".[24] Even once firefighters arrived, their ladders were only long enough to reach as high as the sixth to seventh floors.[25]\\r\\nA large crowd of bystanders gathered on the street, witnessing 62 people jumping or falling to their deaths from the burning building.[26] Louis Waldman, later a New York Socialist state assemblyman, described the scene years later:[27]\\r\\nOne Saturday afternoon in March of that yearMarch 25, to be preciseI was sitting at one of the reading tables in the old Astor Library.  It was a raw, unpleasant day and the comfortable reading room seemed a delightful place to spend the remaining few hours until the library closed. I was deeply engrossed in my book when I became aware of fire engines racing past the building. By this time I was sufficiently Americanized to be fascinated by the sound of fire engines. Along with several others in the library, I ran out to see what was happening, and followed crowds of people to the scene of the fire.\\r\\nA few blocks away, the Asch Building at the corner of Washington Place and Greene Street was ablaze. When we arrived at the scene, the police had thrown up a cordon around the area and the firemen were helplessly fighting the blaze. The eighth, ninth, and tenth stories of the building were now an enormous roaring cornice of flames.\\r\\nWord had spread through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds  I among them  looked up at the burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, pause for a terrified moment, and then leap to the pavement below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. This went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.\\r\\nThe emotions of the crowd were indescribable. Women were hysterical, scores fainted; men wept as, in paroxysms of frenzy, they hurled themselves against the police lines.\\r\\nThe remainder waited until smoke and fire overcame them. The fire department arrived quickly but was unable to stop the flames, as there were no ladders available that could reach beyond the sixth floor. The fallen bodies and falling victims also made it difficult for the fire department to approach the building.\\r\\nAlthough early references of the death toll ranged from 141[28] to 148,[29] almost all modern references agree that 146 people died as a result of the fire: 123 women and 23 men.[30][31][32][33][34][35][36] Most victims died of burns, asphyxiation, blunt impact injuries, or a combination of the three.[37]\\r\\nThe first person to jump was a man, and another man was seen kissing a young woman at the window before they both jumped to their deaths.[38]\\r\\nBodies of the victims were taken to Charities Pier (also called Misery Lane), located at 26th street and the East River, for identification by friends and relatives.[39] Victims were interred in sixteen different cemeteries.[30] Twenty-two victims of the fire were buried by the Hebrew Free Burial Association[40] in a special section at Mount Richmond Cemetery. In some instances, their tombstones refer to the fire.[41] Six victims remained unidentified until Michael Hirsch, a historian, completed four years of researching newspaper articles and other sources for missing persons and was able to identify each of them by name.[30][31] Those six victims were buried together in the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn. Originally interred elsewhere on the grounds, their remains now lie beneath a monument to the tragedy, a large marble slab featuring a kneeling woman.[30][42][43]\\r\\nThe company's owners, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, who survived the fire by fleeing to the building's roof when the fire began, were indicted on charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter in mid-April; the pair's trial began on December 4, 1911.[44] Max Steuer, counsel for the defendants, managed to destroy the credibility of one of the survivors, Kate Alterman, by asking her to repeat her testimony a number of times, which she did without altering key phrases. Steuer argued to the jury that Alterman and possibly other witnesses had memorized their statements, and might even have been told what to say by the prosecutors. The prosecution charged that the owners knew the exit doors were locked at the time in question. The investigation found that the locks were intended to be locked during working hours based on the findings from the fire,[45] but the defense stressed that the prosecution failed to prove that the owners knew that. The jury acquitted the two men of first- and second-degree manslaughter, but they were found liable of wrongful death during a subsequent civil suit in 1913 in which plaintiffs were awarded compensation in the amount of $75 per deceased victim. The insurance company paid Blanck and Harris about $60,000 more than the reported losses, or about $400 per casualty. In 1913, Blanck was once again arrested for locking the door in his factory during working hours. He was fined $20.[46]\\r\\nRose Schneiderman, a prominent socialist and union activist, gave a speech at the memorial meeting held in the Metropolitan Opera House on April 2, 1911, to an audience largely made up of the members of the Women's Trade Union League. She used the fire as an argument for factory workers to organize:\\r\\nI would be a traitor to these poor burned bodies if I came here to talk good fellowship. We have tried you good people of the public and we have found you wanting We have tried you citizens; we are trying you now, and you have a couple of dollars for the sorrowing mothers, brothers and sisters by way of a charity gift. But every time the workers come out in the only way they know to protest against conditions which are unbearable, the strong hand of the law is allowed to press down heavily upon us.\\r\\nPublic officials have only words of warning to uswarning that we must be intensely peaceable, and they have the workhouse just back of all their warnings. The strong hand of the law beats us back, when we rise, into the conditions that make life unbearable.\\r\\nI can't talk fellowship to you who are gathered here. Too much blood has been spilled. I know from my experience it is up to the working people to save themselves. The only way they can save themselves is by a strong working-class movement.[47]\\r\\nOthers in the community, and in particular in the ILGWU,[48] drew a different lesson from events. In New York City, a Committee on Public Safety was formed, headed by eyewitness Frances Perkins,[49] to identify specific problems and lobby for new legislation, such as the bill to grant workers shorter hours in a work week, known as the \\"54-hour Bill\\". The committee's representatives in Albany obtained the backing of Tammany Hall's Al Smith, the Majority Leader of the Assembly, and Robert F. Wagner, the Majority Leader of the Senate, and this collaboration of machine politicians and reformers ÿ also known as \\"do-gooders\\" or \\"goo-goos\\" ÿ got results, especially since Tammany's chief, Charles F. Murphy, realized the advantage to be had from being on the side of the angels.[7]\\r\\nThe New York State Legislature then created the Factory Investigating Commission to \\"investigate factory conditions in this and other cities and to report remedial measures of legislation to prevent hazard or loss of life among employees through fire, unsanitary conditions, and occupational diseases.\\"[50] The Commission was chaired by Wagner and co-chaired by Al Smith. They held a series of widely publicized investigations around the state, interviewing 222 witnesses and taking 3,500 pages of testimony. They hired field agents to do on-site inspections of factories. They started with the issue of fire safety and moved on to broader issues of the risks of injury in the factory environment. Their findings led to thirty-eight new laws regulating labor in New York state, and gave them a reputation as leading progressive reformers working on behalf of the working class. In the process, they changed Tammany's reputation from mere corruption to progressive endeavors to help the workers.[51][52] New York City's Fire Chief John Kenlon told the investigators that his department had identified more than 200 factories where conditions made a fire like that at the Triangle Factory possible.[53] The State Commissions's reports helped modernize the state's labor laws, making New York State \\"one of the most progressive states in terms of labor reform.\\"[54][55] New laws mandated better building access and egress, fireproofing requirements, the availability of fire extinguishers, the installation of alarm systems and automatic sprinklers, better eating and toilet facilities for workers, and limited the number of hours that women and children could work.[56] In the years from 1911 to 1913, sixty of the sixty-four new laws recommended by the Commission were legislated with the support of Governor William Sulzer.[7]\\r\\nAs a result of the fire, the American Society of Safety Engineers was founded in New York City on October 14, 1911.[57]\\r\\nThe last living survivor of the fire was Rose Freedman, ne Rosenfeld, who died in Beverly Hills, California, in 2001 at the age of 107. She was two days away from her 18th birthday at the time of the fire, which she survived by following the company's executives and being rescued from the roof of the building. As a result of her experience, she became a lifelong supporter of unions.[58]\\r\\nThe Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition is an alliance of more than 200 organizations and individuals formed in 2008 to encourage and coordinate nationwide activities commemorating the centennial of the fire[59] and to create a permanent public art memorial to honor its victims.[60][61] The founding partners included Workers United, the New York City Fire Museum, New York University (the current owner of the building), Workmen's Circle, Museum at Eldridge Street, the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, the Gotham Center for New York City History, the Bowery Poetry Club and others. Members of the Coalition include arts organizations, schools, workers rights groups, labor unions, human rights and womens rights groups, ethnic organizations, historical preservation societies, activists, and scholars, as well as families of the victims and survivors.\\r\\nThe Coalition grew out of a public art project called \\"Chalk\\" created by New York City filmmaker Ruth Sergel.[62] Every year beginning in 2004, Sergel and volunteer artists went across New York City on the anniversary of the fire to inscribe in chalk the names, ages, and causes of death of the victims in front of their former homes, often including drawings of flowers, tombstones or a triangle.[59][63]\\r\\nFrom July 2009 through the weeks leading up to the 100th anniversary, the Coalition served as a clearinghouse to network some 200 activities as varied as academic conferences, films, theater performances, art shows, concerts, readings, awareness campaigns, walking tours, and parades that were held in and around New York City, and in cities across the nation, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, Boston and Washington, D.C.[59][59]\\r\\nThe ceremony, which was held in front of the building where the fire took place, was preceded by a march through Greenwich Village by thousands of people, some carrying shirtwaists ÿ women's blouses ÿ on poles, or wearing sashes commemorating the names of those who died in the fire. Speakers included the United States Secretary of Labor, Hilda L. Solis, U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the actor Danny Glover, and Suzanne Pred Bass, the grandniece of Rosie Weiner, a young woman killed in the blaze. Most of the speakers that day called for the strengthening of workers rights and organized labor.[64][65]\\r\\nAt 4:45 PM EST, the moment the first fire alarm was sounded in 1911, hundreds of bells rang out in cities and towns across the nation. For this commemorative act, the Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition organized hundreds of churches, schools, fire houses, and private individuals in the New York City region and across the nation. The Coalition maintains on its website a national map denoting each of the bells that rang that afternoon.[66]\\r\\nThe Coalition has launched an effort to create a permanent public art memorial for the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire at the site of the 1911 fire in lower Manhattan. In 2012, the Coalition announced a national design competition for the memorial, and formed a design search committee, with representatives from Workers United, New York University, the New York City Fire Department, the Kheel Center for Labor-Management Documentation & Archives, Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, Manhattan Community Board 2, family members of the victims, historians, and community members.[67][68] On December 22, 2015, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that $1.5 million from state economic development funds would be earmarked to build the Triangle Fire Memorial.[69]\\r\\nPlans for the memorial include steel panels that wrap around the building, as well as upper and lower panels that will list the names of the victims and tell the story of the fire. A reflective steel beam will extend from the corner of the building to the eighth floor, the place of origin for the fire.[70]\\r\\nIn 2011, the Coalition established that the goal of the permanent memorial would be:\\r\\nFilms and television\\r\\nMusic\\r\\nTheatre and dance\\r\\nLiterature\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nBibliography\\r\\nFurther reading\\r\\nGeneral\\r\\nContemporaneous accounts\\r\\nTrial\\r\\nArticles\\r\\nMemorials and centennial","input":"What caused the fire in the triangle shirtwaist factory?"},{"output":"the cranium and the mandible","context":"The skull is a bony structure that forms the head in most vertebrates. It supports the structures of the face and provides a protective cavity for the brain.[1] The skull is composed of two parts: the cranium and the mandible. In the human these two parts are the neurocranium and the viscerocranium or facial skeleton that includes the mandible as its largest bone. The skull forms the anterior most portion of the skeleton and is a product of cephalisationhousing the brain, and several sensory structures such as the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.[2] In humans these sensory structures are part of the facial skeleton.\\r\\nFunctions of the skull include protection of the brain, fixing the distance between the eyes to allow stereoscopic vision, and fixing the position of the ears to enable sound localisation of the direction and distance of sounds. In some animals such as horned ungulates, the skull also has a defensive function by providing the mount (on the frontal bone) for the horns.\\r\\nThe English word \\"skull\\" is probably derived from Old Norse \\"skulle\\", while the Latin word cranium comes from the Greek root ϫ? (kranion).\\r\\nThe skull is made up of a number of fused flat bones, and contains many foramina, fossae, processes, and several cavities or sinuses. In zoology there are openings in the skull called fenestrae.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\r\\nThe human skull is the bony structure that forms the head in the human skeleton. It supports the structures of the face and forms a cavity for the brain. Like the skulls of other vertebrates, it protects the brain from injury.\\r\\nThe skull consists of two parts, of different embryological originthe neurocranium and the facial skeleton (also called the membraneous viscerocranium). The neurocranium (or braincase) forms the protective cranial cavity that surrounds and houses the brain and brainstem. The upper areas of the cranial bones form the calvaria (skullcap). The neurocranium includes the mandible.\\r\\nThe facial skeleton is formed by the bones supporting the face.\\r\\nExcept for the mandible, all of the bones of the skull are joined together by suturessynarthrodial (immovable) joints formed by bony ossification, with Sharpey's fibres permitting some flexibility. Sometimes there can be extra bone pieces within the suture known as wormian bones or sutural bones.\\r\\nThe human skull is generally considered to consist of twenty-two boneseight cranial bones and fourteen facial skeleton bones. In the neurocranium these are the occipital bone, two temporal bones, two parietal bones, the sphenoid, ethmoid and frontal bones.\\r\\nThe bones of the facial skeleton(14) are the vomer, two nasal conchae, two nasal bones, two maxilla, the mandible, two palatine bones, two zygomatic bones, and two lacrimal bones. Some sources count a paired bone as one, or the maxilla as having two bones (as its parts); some sources include the hyoid bone or the three ossicles of the middle ear but the overall general consensus of the number of bones in the human skull is the stated twenty-two.\\r\\nSome of these bonesthe occipital, parietal, frontal, in the neurocranium, and the nasal, lacrimal, and vomer, in the facial skeleton are flat bones.\\r\\nThe skull also contains sinus cavities and numerous foramina. The sinuses are lined with respiratory epithelium. Their known functions are the lessening of the weight of the skull, the aiding of resonance to the voice and the warming and moistening of the air drawn through the nasal cavity.\\r\\nThe foramina are openings in the skull. The largest of these is the foramen magnum that allows the passage of the spinal cord as well as nerves and blood vessels.\\r\\nThe many processes of the skull include the mastoid process and the zygomatic process.\\r\\nThe skull is a complex structure; its bones are formed both by intramembranous and endochondral ossification. The skull roof bones, comprising the bones of the facial skeleton and the sides and roof of the neurocranium, are dermal bones formed by intramembranous ossification, though the temporal bones are formed by endochondral ossification. The endocranium, the bones supporting the brain (the occipital, sphenoid, and ethmoid) are largely formed by endochondral ossification. Thus frontal and parietal bones are purely membranous.[3] The geometry of the skull base and its fossae, the anterior, middle and posterior cranial fossae changes rapidly. The anterior cranial fossa changes especially during the first trimester of pregnancy and skull defects can often develop during this time.[4]\\r\\nAt birth, the human skull is made up of 44 separate bony elements. During development, many of these bony elements gradually fuse together into solid bone (for example, the frontal bone). The bones of the roof of the skull are initially separated by regions of dense connective tissue called fontanelles. There are six fontanelles: one anterior (or frontal), one posterior (or occipital), two sphenoid (or anterolateral), and two mastoid (or posterolateral). At birth these regions are fibrous and moveable, necessary for birth and later growth. This growth can put a large amount of tension on the \\"obstetrical hinge\\", which is where the squamous and lateral parts of the occipital bone meet. A possible complication of this tension is rupture of the great cerebral vein. As growth and ossification progress, the connective tissue of the fontanelles is invaded and replaced by bone creating sutures. The five sutures are the two squamous sutures, one coronal, one lambdoid, and one sagittal suture. The posterior fontanelle usually closes by eight weeks, but the anterior fontanel can remain open up to eighteen months. The anterior fontanelle is located at the junction of the frontal and parietal bones; it is a \\"soft spot\\" on a baby's forehead. Careful observation will show that you can count a baby's heart rate by observing the pulse pulsing softly through the anterior fontanelle.\\r\\nThe skull in the neonate is large in proportion to other parts of the body. The facial skeleton is one seventh of the size of the calvaria. (In the adult it is half the size). The base of the skull is short and narrow, though the inner ear is almost adult size.[5]\\r\\nCraniosynostosis is a condition in which one or more of the fibrous sutures in an infant skull prematurely fuses,[6] and changes the growth pattern of the skull.[7] Because the skull cannot expand perpendicular to the fused suture, it grows more in the parallel direction.[7] Sometimes the resulting growth pattern provides the necessary space for the growing brain, but results in an abnormal head shape and abnormal facial features.[7] In cases in which the compensation does not effectively provide enough space for the growing brain, craniosynostosis results in increased intracranial pressure leading possibly to visual impairment, sleeping impairment, eating difficulties, or an impairment of mental development.[8]\\r\\nA copper beaten skull is a phenomenon wherein intense intracranial pressure disfigures the internal surface of the skull.[9] The name comes from the fact that the inner skull has the appearance of having been beaten with a ball-peen hammer, such as is often used by coppersmiths. The condition is most common in children.\\r\\nInjuries to the brain can be life-threatening. Normally the skull protects the brain from damage through its hard unyieldingness; the skull is one of the least deformable structures found in nature with it needing the force of about 1 ton to reduce the diameter of the skull by 1?cm.[10] In some cases, however, of head injury, there can be raised intracranial pressure through mechanisms such as a subdural haematoma. In these cases the raised intracranial pressure can cause herniation of the brain out of the foramen magnum (\\"coning\\") because there is no space for the brain to expand; this can result in significant brain damage or death unless an urgent operation is performed to relieve the pressure. This is why patients with concussion must be watched extremely carefully.\\r\\nDating back to Neolithic times, a skull operation called trepanning was sometimes performed. This involved drilling a burr hole in the cranium. Examination of skulls from this period reveals that the patients sometimes survived for many years afterward. It seems likely that trepanning was also performed purely for ritualistic or religious reasons. Nowadays this procedure is still used but is normally called a craniectomy.\\r\\nIn March 2013, for the first time in the U.S., researchers replaced a large percentage of a patient's skull with a precision, 3D-printed polymer implant.[11] About 9 months later the first complete cranium replacement with a 3D-printed plastic insert was performed on a Dutch woman. She had been suffering from hyperostosis, which increased the thickness of her skull and compressed her brain.[12]\\r\\nSurgical alteration of sexually dimorphic skull features may be carried out as a part of facial feminization surgery, a set of reconstructive surgical procedures that can alter male facial features to bring them closer in shape and size to typical female facial features.[13][14] These procedures can be an important part of the treatment of transgender people for gender dysphoria.[15][16]\\r\\nArtificial cranial deformation is a largely historical practice of some cultures. Cords and wooden boards would be used to apply pressure to an infant's skull and alter its shape, sometimes quite significantly. This procedure would begin just after birth and would be carried on for several years.\\r\\nLike the face, the skull and teeth can also indicate a person's life history and origin. Forensic scientists and archaeologists use metric and nonmetric traits to estimate what the bearer of the skull looked like. When a significant amount of bones are found, such as at Spitalfields in the UK and Jmon shell mounds in Japan, osteologists can use traits, such as the proportions of length, height and width, to know the relationships of the population of the study with other living or extinct populations.\\r\\nThe German physician Franz Joseph Gall in around 1800 formulated the theory of phrenology, which attempted to show that specific features of the skull are associated with certain personality traits or intellectual capabilities of its owner. His theory is now considered to be pseudoscientific.\\r\\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, anthropologists found it crucial to distinguish between male and female skulls. An anthropologist of the time, James McGrigor Allan, argued that the female brain was similar to that of an animal.[17] This allowed anthropologists to declare that women were in fact more emotional and less rational than men. McGrigor then concluded that womens brains were more analogous to infants, thus deeming them inferior at the time.[18] To further these claims of female inferiority and silence the feminists of the time, other anthropologists joined in on the studies of the female skull. These cranial measurements are the basis of what is known as craniology. These cranial measurements were also used to draw a connection between women and black people.[18]\\r\\nResearch has shown that while in early life there is little difference between male and female skulls, in adulthood male skulls tend to be larger and more robust than female skulls, which are lighter and smaller, with a cranial capacity about 10 percent less than that of the male.[19] However, later studies show that women's skulls are slightly thicker and thus men may be more susceptible to head injury than women.[20][21]\\r\\nMale skulls can have more prominent supraorbital ridges, a more prominent glabella, and more prominent temporal lines. Female skulls generally have rounder orbits, and narrower jaws. Male skulls on average have larger, broader palates, squarer orbits, larger mastoid processes, larger sinuses, and larger occipital condyles than those of females. Male mandibles typically have squarer chins and thicker, rougher muscle attachments than female mandibles.\\r\\nThe cephalic index is the ratio of the width of the head, multiplied by 100 and divided by its length (front to back). The index is also used to categorize animals, especially dogs and cats. The width is usually measured just below the parietal eminence, and the length from the glabella to the occipital point.\\r\\nHumans may be:\\r\\n[5]\\r\\nThe skull of fishes is formed from a series of only loosely connected bones. Lampreys and sharks only possess a cartilaginous endocranium, with both the upper and lower jaws being separate elements. Bony fishes have additional dermal bone, forming a more or less coherent skull roof in lungfish and holost fish. The lower jaw defines a chin.\\r\\nThe simpler structure is found in jawless fish, in which the cranium is normally represented by a trough-like basket of cartilaginous elements only partially enclosing the brain, and associated with the capsules for the inner ears and the single nostril. Distinctively, these fish have no jaws.[22]\\r\\nCartilaginous fish, such as sharks and rays, have also simple, and presumably primitive, skull structures. The cranium is a single structure forming a case around the brain, enclosing the lower surface and the sides, but always at least partially open at the top as a large fontanelle. The most anterior part of the cranium includes a forward plate of cartilage, the rostrum, and capsules to enclose the olfactory organs. Behind these are the orbits, and then an additional pair of capsules enclosing the structure of the inner ear. Finally, the skull tapers towards the rear, where the foramen magnum lies immediately above a single condyle, articulating with the first vertebra. There are, in addition, at various points throughout the cranium, smaller foramina for the cranial nerves. The jaws consist of separate hoops of cartilage, almost always distinct from the cranium proper.[22]\\r\\nIn ray-finned fishes, there has also been considerable modification from the primitive pattern. The roof of the skull is generally well formed, and although the exact relationship of its bones to those of tetrapods is unclear, they are usually given similar names for convenience. Other elements of the skull, however, may be reduced; there is little cheek region behind the enlarged orbits, and little, if any bone in between them. The upper jaw is often formed largely from the premaxilla, with the maxilla itself located further back, and an additional bone, the symplectic, linking the jaw to the rest of the cranium.[23]\\r\\nAlthough the skulls of fossil lobe-finned fish resemble those of the early tetrapods, the same cannot be said of those of the living lungfishes. The skull roof is not fully formed, and consists of multiple, somewhat irregularly shaped bones with no direct relationship to those of tetrapods. The upper jaw is formed from the pterygoids and vomers alone, all of which bear teeth. Much of the skull is formed from cartilage, and its overall structure is reduced.[23]\\r\\nThe skulls of the earliest tetrapods closely resembled those of their ancestors amongst the lobe-finned fishes. The skull roof is formed of a series of plate-like bones, including the maxilla, frontals, parietals, and lacrimals, among others. It is overlaying the endocranium, corresponding to the cartilaginous skull in sharks and rays. The various separate bones that compose the temporal bone of humans are also part of the skull roof series. A further plate composed of four pairs of bones forms the roof of the mouth; these include the vomer and palatine bones. The base of the cranium is formed from a ring of bones surrounding the foramen magnum and a median bone lying further forward; these are homologous with the occipital bone and parts of the sphenoid in mammals. Finally, the lower jaw is composed of multiple bones, only the most anterior of which (the dentary) is homologous with the mammalian mandible.[23]\\r\\nIn living tetrapods, a great many of the original bones have either disappeared or fused into one another in various arrangements.\\r\\nBirds have a diapsid skull, as in reptiles, with a pre-lacrymal fossa (present in some reptiles). The skull has a single occipital condyle.[24] The skull consists of five major bones: the frontal (top of head), parietal (back of head), premaxillary and nasal (top beak), and the mandible (bottom beak). The skull of a normal bird usually weighs about 1% of the bird's total bodyweight. The eye occupies a considerable amount of the skull and is surrounded by a sclerotic eye-ring, a ring of tiny bones. This characteristic is also seen in reptiles.\\r\\nLiving amphibians typically have greatly reduced skulls, with many of the bones either absent or wholly or partly replaced by cartilage.[23] In mammals and birds, in particular, modifications of the skull occurred to allow for the expansion of the brain. The fusion between the various bones is especially notable in birds, in which the individual structures may be difficult to identify.\\r\\nThe fenestrae (from Latin, meaning windows) are openings in the skull.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temporal fenestrae are anatomical features of the skulls of several types of amniotes, characterised by bilaterally symmetrical holes (fenestrae) in the temporal bone. Depending on the lineage of a given animal, two, one, or no pairs of temporal fenestrae may be present, above or below the postorbital and squamosal bones. The upper temporal fenestrae are also known as the supratemporal fenestrae, and the lower temporal fenestrae are also known as the infratemporal fenestrae. The presence and morphology of the temporal fenestra are critical for taxonomic classification of the synapsids, of which mammals are part.\\r\\nPhysiological speculation associates it with a rise in metabolic rates and an increase in jaw musculature. The earlier amniotes of the Carboniferous did not have temporal fenestrae but two more advanced lines did: the synapsids (mammal-like reptiles) and the diapsids (most reptiles and later birds). As time progressed, diapsids' and synapsids' temporal fenestrae became more modified and larger to make stronger bites and more jaw muscles. Dinosaurs, which are diapsids, have large advanced openings, and their descendants, the birds, have temporal fenestrae which have been modified. Mammals, which are synapsids, possess no fenestral openings in the skull, as the trait has been modified. They do, though, still have the temporal orbit (which resembles an opening) and the temporal muscles. It is a hole in the head and is situated to the rear of the orbit behind the eye.\\r\\nThere are four types of amniote skull, classified by the number and location of their temporal fenestrae. These are:\\r\\nEvolutionarily, they are related as follows:\\r\\nThe jugal is a skull bone found in most reptiles, amphibians, and birds. In mammals, the jugal is often called the zygomatic bone or malar bone.\\r\\nThe prefrontal bone is a bone separating the lacrimal and frontal bones in many tetrapod skulls.\\r\\nThis article incorporates text in the public domain from the 20th edition of Gray's Anatomy (1918)","input":"What are the two parts of the skull?"},{"output":"for 20 seasons","context":"\\r\\nGunsmoke is an American radio and television Western drama series created by director Norman Macdonnell and writer John Meston. The stories take place in and around Dodge City, Kansas, during the settlement of the American West. The central character is lawman Marshal Matt Dillon, played by William Conrad on radio and James Arness on television. When aired in the UK, the television series was initially titled Gun Law,[1] later reverting to Gunsmoke.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe radio series ran from 1952 to 1961. John Dunning[3] wrote that among radio drama enthusiasts, \\"Gunsmoke is routinely placed among the best shows of any kind and any time.\\" The television series ran for 20 seasons from 1955 to 1975, and lasted for 635 episodes. At the end of its run in 1975, Los Angeles Times columnist Cecil Smith wrote: \\"Gunsmoke was the dramatization of the American epic legend of the west. Our own Iliad and Odyssey, created from standard elements of the dime novel and the pulp Western as romanticized by [Ned] Buntline, [Bret] Harte, and [Mark] Twain. It was ever the stuff of legend.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1940s, CBS chairman William S. Paley, a fan of the Philip Marlowe radio serial, asked his programming chief, Hubell Robinson, to develop a hardboiled Western series, a show about a \\"Philip Marlowe of the Old West\\". Robinson instructed his West Coast CBS Vice President, Harry Ackerman, who had developed the Philip Marlowe series, to take on the task.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAckerman and his scriptwriters, Mort Fine and David Friedkin, created an audition script called \\"Mark Dillon Goes to Gouge Eye\\" based on one of their Michael Shayne radio scripts, \\"The Crooked Wheel\\". Two auditions were created in 1949. The first was very much like a hardboiled detective series and starred Michael Rye (credited as Rye Billsbury) as Dillon; the second starred Straight Arrow actor Howard Culver in a more Western, lighter version of the same script. CBS liked the Culver version better, and Ackerman was told to proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA complication arose, though; Culver's contract as the star of Straight Arrow would not allow him to do another Western series. The project was shelved for three years, when producer Norman Macdonnell and writer John Meston discovered it while creating an adult Western series of their own.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMacdonnell and Meston wanted to create a radio Western for adults, in contrast to the prevailing juvenile fare such as The Lone Ranger and The Cisco Kid. Gunsmoke was set in Dodge City, Kansas, during the thriving cattle days of the 1870s. Dunning[5] notes, \\"The show drew critical acclaim for unprecedented realism.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe radio series first aired on CBS on April 26, 1952 with the episode \\"Billy the Kid\\", written by Walter Newman, and ended on June 18, 1961. The show stars William Conrad as Marshal Matt Dillon, Howard McNear as Doc Charles Adams, Georgia Ellis as Kitty Russell, and Parley Baer as Dillon's assistant, Chester Wesley Proudfoot.\\r\\n\\r\\nMatt Dillon was played on radio by William Conrad and on TV by James Arness. Two versions of the same pilot episode titled \\"Mark Dillon Goes to Gouge Eye\\" are in the archives with two different actors, Rye Billsbury and Howard Culver, playing Marshal \\"Mark\\" Dillon as the lead, not yet played by Conrad. Conrad was one of the last actors to audition for the role of Marshal Dillon. With a resonantly powerful and distinctive voice, Conrad was already one of radio's busiest actors. Though Meston championed him, Macdonnell thought Conrad might be overexposed. During his audition, however, Conrad won over Macdonnell after reading only a few lines. Dillon as portrayed by Conrad was a lonely, isolated man, toughened by a hard life. Macdonnell later claimed, \\"Much of Matt Dillon's character grew out of Bill Conrad.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeston relished the upending of cherished Western fiction clichs and felt that few Westerns gave any inkling of how brutal the Old West was in reality. Many episodes were based on man's cruelty to man and woman, inasmuch as the prairie woman's life and the painful treatment of women as chattels were touched on well ahead of their time in most media. As originally pitched to CBS executives, this was to be an adult Western, not a grown-up Hopalong Cassidy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunning writes that Meston was especially disgusted by the archetypal Western hero and set out \\"to destroy [that type of] character he loathed\\". In Meston's view, \\"Dillon was almost as scarred as the homicidal psychopaths who drifted into Dodge from all directions.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nChester was played by Parley Baer on radio, and by Dennis Weaver on television.\\r\\nChester's character had no surname until Baer ad libbed \\"Proudfoot\\" during an early rehearsal. Initial Gunsmoke scripts gave him no name at all; his lines were simply slugged to be spoken by \\"Townsman\\". Again, Conrad's sense of what the program would be supervened, and Chester was born. Chester's middle initial was given as \\"W\\" in the June 15, 1958 episode \\"Old Flame\\", and a few episodes later, on the July 7, 1958 episode \\"Marshal Proudfoot\\", it is revealed that his middle name, as are his 10 siblings, is Wesley. The amiable Waco expatriate was usually described as Dillon's \\"assistant\\", but in the December 13, 1952, episode \\"Post Martin\\", Dillon described Chester as Dillon's deputy. Contradicting this description, in the July 5, 1954, episode \\"Hank Prine\\" (episode 116, minute 3:02) Dillon corrects a prisoner who describes Chester as his \\"deputy\\" stating \\"Chester is not my deputy\\", though they both agree Chester acts like he is. Whatever his title, Chester was Dillon's foil, friend, partner, and in an episode in which Chester nearly dies (\\"Never Pester Chester\\"), Dillon allows that Chester was the only person he could trust. The TV series changed the newly limping Chester's last name from Proudfoot to Goode. Chester was played by Dennis Weaver who went on to star in the NBC Mystery Movie rotating TV series entry of a police drama with a comedic touch ÿ McCloud in the early 1970s. Weaver, himself an impressive 6'2\\", often looked small alongside Arness' height at 6'7\\", this could be partly due to the character Chester having a limp. Season 2, episode 25 tells us that Chester was in the army. He would not have had the limp then, so probably got injured in the Civil War. Not long ago but long enough that he would have learned to live with the limp and virtually forget it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoward McNear starred as Dr. Charles Adams in the radio series, with Milburn Stone portraying Dr. Galen Adams in the television version.\\r\\nIn the radio series, \\"Doc\\" Adams was initially a self-interested and somewhat dark character with a predilection for constantly attempting to increase his revenue through the procurement of autopsy fees. However, McNear's performances steadily became more warm-hearted and sympathetic. Most notably, this transformation began during (and progressed steadily following) the July 1952 episode \\"Never Pester Chester,\\" in which a physician with a more compassionate and devoted temperament is essential to the plotline when Chester is near-fatally injured by two trouble-making Texas drovers. Doc Adams' backstory evokes a varied and experienced life: In some episodes, he had educational ties to Philadelphia; in others, he spent time as ship's doctor aboard the gambling boats that plied the Mississippi River, which provided a background for his knowledge of New Orleans (and acquaintance with Mark Twain). In the January 31, 1953, episode \\"Cavalcade\\", a fuller history is offered, though subsequent programs kept close listeners' heads spinning. In \\"Cavalcade\\", his real name is Calvin Moore, educated in Boston, and he practiced as a doctor for a year in Richmond, Virginia, where he fell in love with a beautiful young woman who was also being courted by a wealthy young man named Roger Beauregard. Beauregard forced Doc into fighting a duel with him, resulting in Beauregard's being shot and killed. Though it was a fair duel, because Doc was a Yankee and an outsider, he was forced to flee. The young woman fled after him and they were married in St. Louis, but two months later, she died of typhus. Doc wandered throughout the territories until he settled in Dodge City 17 years later under the name of \\"Charles Adams\\". The Adams moniker was another Conrad invention, borrowing the surname from cartoonist Charles Addams as a testament to Doc's initially ghoulish comportment.\\r\\n\\r\\nKitty was played by Georgia Ellis on radio, and by Amanda Blake on TV.\\r\\nGeorgia Ellis first appeared in the radio episode \\"Billy the Kid\\" (April 26, 1952) as \\"Francie Richards\\", a former girlfriend of Matt Dillon and the widow of a criminal. \\"Miss Kitty\\" did not appear until the May 10, 1952, episode \\"Jaliscoe\\". Kitty's profession was hinted at, but never explicit; in a 1953 interview with Time, Macdonnell declared, \\"Kitty is just someone Matt has to visit every once in a while.\\"[7] An out-take from the program makes this hilariously obvious.[8] The television show first portrayed Kitty as a saloon employee (dance-hall girl/prostitute) then from season 3 as half owner of the Long Branch Saloon. Sometime in 1959, Ellis was billed as Georgia Hawkins instead of Georgia Ellis.\\r\\n\\r\\nGunsmoke was often a somber program, particularly in its early years. Dunning writes that Dillon \\"played his hand and often lost. He arrived too late to prevent a lynching. He amputated a dying man's leg and lost the patient anyway. He saved a girl from brutal rapists then found himself unable to offer her what she needed to stop her from moving into ... life as a prostitute.\\"[9] Some listeners, such as Dunning, argue the radio version was more realistic. Episodes were aimed at adults and featured some of the most explicit content of their time, including violent crimes, scalpings, massacres, and opium addicts. Many episodes ended on a somber note, and villains often got away with their crimes. Nonetheless, due to the subtle scripts and outstanding ensemble cast, over the years, the program evolved into a warm, often humorous celebration of human nature.  Despite Gunsmoke's realism in some areas, the show took liberties with accuracy in others.  The program was set after the arrival of the railroad in Dodge City (1872) and Kansas had been a state since 1861.  A U.S. Marshal (actually a deputy marshal, only the senior officer in the district holds the title \\"marshal\\") would not be based in Dodge City and would not be involved in local law enforcement.  And any peace officer, then and now, would not approach an armed individual with his side-arm holstered and give the suspect a chance to draw.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from the doleful tone, Gunsmoke was distinct from other radio Westerns, as the dialogue was often slow and halting, and due to the outstanding sound effects, listeners had a nearly palpable sense of the prairie where the show was set. The effects were subtle but multilayered, giving the show a spacious feel. John Dunning wrote, \\"The listener heard extraneous dialogue in the background, just above the muted shouts of kids playing in an alley. He heard noises from the next block, too, where the inevitable dog was barking.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nGunsmoke was also unique from other Westerns in that it was unsponsored for the first few years of production. The program got its support from CBS for the first two years. Series producers felt that if the show were sponsored, they would have to \\"clean the show up\\".[11] The producers wanted to find a sponsor that would allow them to keep the show the way it was.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long after the radio show began, talk began of adapting it to television. Privately, Macdonnell had a guarded interest in taking the show to television, but publicly, he declared, \\"our show is perfect for radio,\\" and he feared, as Dunning writes, \\"Gunsmoke confined by a picture could not possibly be as authentic or attentive to detail.\\" \\"In the end\\", wrote Dunning, \\"CBS simply took it away from Macdonnell and began preparing for the television version.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nConrad and the others were given auditions, but they were little more than token effortsespecially in Conrad's case, due to his obesity. However, Meston was kept as the main writer. In the early years, a majority of the TV episodes were adapted from the radio scripts, often using identical scenes and dialogue. Dunning wrote, \\"That radio fans considered the TV show a sham and its players impostors should surprise no one. That the TV show was not a sham is due in no small part to the continued strength of Meston's scripts.\\" [9]\\r\\n\\r\\nMacdonnell and Meston continued the radio version of Gunsmoke until 1961, making it one of the most enduring vintage radio dramas.\\r\\n\\r\\nConrad directed two television episodes, in 1963 and 1971, while McNear appeared on six, playing characters other than Doc, including three times as storekeeper Howard Rudd.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe TV series ran from September 10, 1955, to March 31, 1975, on CBS, with 635 total episodes. It was the second Western television series written for adults,[13] premiering on September 10, 1955, four days after The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp.[14][15] The first 12 seasons aired Saturdays at 10 pm, seasons 13 through 16 aired Mondays at 7:30?pm, and the last four seasons aired Mondays at 8 pm. During its second season in 1956, the program joined the list of the top ten television programs broadcast in the United States. It quickly moved to number one and stayed there until 1961. It remained among the top 20 programs until 1964.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe television series remains the longest-running, primetime live-action series of the 20th century. As of  2017[update], it has the highest number of scripted episodes for any U.S. primetime, commercial, live-action television series. On April 29, 2018, The Simpsons surpassed Gunsmoke for the most scripted episodes.[17] Some TV fans question its position as having the longest run. Some foreign-made programs, i.e. produced outside the U.S., have been broadcast in the U.S. and contend for the position as the longest-running series.[notes 1] As of  2016[update], Gunsmoke is rated fourth globally, after Doctor Who (1963ÿ89, 2005ÿpresent), Taggart (1983ÿ2010),[18] and The Bill (1984ÿ2010).\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Arness and Milburn Stone portrayed their Gunsmoke characters for 20 consecutive years, a feat later matched by Kelsey Grammer as the character Frasier Crane, but over two half-hour sitcoms (Cheers and Frasier).[19] George Walsh, the announcer for Gunsmoke, began in 1952 on radio's Gunsmoke and continued until television's Gunsmoke was canceled in 1975.[20] The first seven seasons were jointly sponsored by L&M cigarettes and Remington shaving products.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Gunsmoke was adapted for television in 1955, in spite of a campaign to persuade the network, the network was not interested in bringing either Conrad or his radio costars to the television medium. Conrad's weight was rumored to be a deciding factor. Denver Pyle was also considered for the leading role, as was Raymond Burr, who was ultimately also seen as too heavy for the part. Charles Warren, television Gunsmoke's first director, said \\"His voice was fine, but he was too big. When he stood up, his chair stood with him.\\"[21] According to Dennis Weaver's comments on the 50th Anniversary DVD, Disc One, Episode \\"Hack Prine\\", John Wayne was never considered for the role; to have done so would have been preposterous since Wayne was a top movie leading man. The belief that Wayne was asked to star is disputed by Warren. Although he agrees Wayne encouraged Arness to take the role, Warren says, \\"I hired Jim Arness on the strength of a picture he's done for me ... I never thought for a moment of offering it to Wayne.\\"[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Thomas \\"Duke\\" Miller, a TV/movie/celebrity expert, this story was told to him by legendary actor James Stewart: \\"Jimmy said he was in the office with Charles Warren when Mr. Wayne came in. Mr. Warren asked Wayne if he knew James Arness, and Mr. Wayne said yes. Mr. Warren told Mr. Wayne about the transition of the show from radio to TV, and Mr. Wayne readily agreed that James Arness would be a terrific choice for the part of Matt Dillon. I have no reason to doubt the story, because Jimmy absolutely knew everybody.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, the primary roles were all recast, with Arness taking the lead role of Marshal Matt Dillon (on the recommendation of Wayne, who also introduced the pilot); Dennis Weaver playing Chester Goode; Milburn Stone being cast as Dr. G. \\"Doc\\" Adams (later Galen \\"Doc\\" Adams); and Amanda Blake taking on the role of Miss Kitty Russell. Macdonnell became the associate producer of the TV show and later the producer. Meston was named head writer.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood evening. My name's Wayne. Some of you may have seen me before; I hope so. I've been kicking around Hollywood a long time. I've made a lot of pictures out here, all kinds, and some of them have been Westerns. And that's what I'm here to tell you about tonight: a Westerna new television show called Gunsmoke. No, I'm not in it. I wish I were, though, because I think it's the best thing of its kind that's come along, and I hope you'll agree with me; it's honest, it's adult, it's realistic. When I first heard about the show Gunsmoke, I knew there was only one man to play in it: James Arness. He's a young fellow, and maybe new to some of you, but I've worked with him and I predict he'll be a big star, so you might as well get used to him, like you've had to get used to me! And now I'm proud to present my friend Jim Arness in Gunsmoke.\\r\\nChester and Festus Haggen are perhaps Dillon's most recognizable sidekicks, though others became acting deputies for ?2?1?2- to ?7?1?2-year stints: Quint Asper (Burt Reynolds) (1962ÿ65), Thad Greenwood (Roger Ewing) (1966ÿ68), and Newly O'Brien (Buck Taylor) (1967ÿ75), who served as both back-up deputy and doctor-in-training, having some studies in medicine via his uncle, which then continued under Doc Adams.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1962, Burt Reynolds was added to the show's lineup, as the \\"halfbreed\\" blacksmith Quint Asper, and performed that role eclipsing the years just before the departure of Chester Goode and just after the appearance of Festus Haggen. Three of the actors, who played Dodge deputies, Ken Curtis, Roger Ewing, and Buck Taylor, had previous guest roles. Curtis, a big band and Western singer (Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, Shep Fields Band, Sons of the Pioneers), had five previous guest roles, including one in 1963 as a shady ladies' man named Kyle Kelly (\\"Lover Boy,\\" season 9, show two [episode 307]).[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nCurtis first appeared in the 1959 episode \\"Jayhawkers\\" (season four, episode 21 [episode 138]), where he played Phil Jacks, a Texas cowboy, with Jack Elam as his boss during a cattle drive from Texas. The second was another 1959 episode entitled \\"Change of Heart\\" (season four, episode 32 [episode 149]), where he played Brisco. The third appearance is the 1960 episode \\"The Ex-Urbanites\\" (season five, episode 30 [episode 186]), where he plays Jesse. He also had a small role as an Indian named Scout in the episode \\"Speak Me Fair\\" (season five, episode 34 [episode 190]) in 1960. Curtis was reared in Las Animas, Colorado, and for a time was a son-in-law of director John Ford.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1963, Weaver left the series to pursue a broader acting career in TV series and films. In 1964, Curtis was signed as a regular to play the stubbornly illiterate hillbilly Festus Haggen. The character, heretofore a comic feature, came to town in a 1962 episode titled \\"Us Haggens,\\" to avenge the death of his twin brother Fergus, and decided to stay in Dodge when the deed was done. Initially on the fringes of Dodge society, Festus was slowly phased in as a reliable sidekick/part-time deputy to Matt Dillon when Reynolds left in 1965. In the episode \\"Alias Festus Haggen,\\" he is mistaken for a robber and killer whom he has to expose to free himself (both parts played by Curtis). In a comic relief episode (\\"Mad Dog,\\" another case of mistaken identity forces Festus to fight three sons of a man killed by his cousin. As a side note, only one episode has all three actors in it playing their respective roles. It is the 1964 episode entitled \\"Prairie Wolfer\\" (season 9, episode 16 [episode 321]), with Dennis Weaver as Chester, Burt Reynolds as Quint, and Ken Curtis as Festus.[25] The 1964 episode entitled \\"Once a Haggen\\" (season 9, episode 18 [episode 323]) is the second of only two occasions in which Chester and Festus appear in the same episode.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Milburn Stone left the series for heart bypass surgery in 1971, Pat Hingle played his temporary replacement Dr. John Chapman for several episodes. His presence was at first roundly resisted by Festus, a bickersome but close friend of Doc Adams.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe back stories of some of the main characters were largely left to the imagination of the viewer. Matt Dillon spent his early years in foster care, knew the Bible, was a wayward, brawling cowboy, and later mentored by a caring lawman. In a few episodes, he mentioned having spent some time in the army. Kitty Russell, was born in New Orleans and reared by a flashy foster mother (who once visited Dodge), although her father visited Dodge on one occasion and wished to have her return to New Orleans.  Barkeep Sam was said to be married, but no sightings of a wife were made (In the episode \\"Tafton,\\" he is seen side-by-side with a woman in a church singing). Quint Asper's white father was killed by white scavengers. Thad Greenwood's father, a storekeeper, was harassed to death by a trio of loathsome ne'er-do-well thieves. Chester Goode was known to be one of many brothers raised by an aunt and uncle, and he mentions his mother on one occasion; he referred to past service in the cavalry, and years as a cattle driver in Texas. The cause of Chester's stiff right leg was never given, but it was shown as his own leg and not a prosthesis. No direct reference to his disability was ever made in the script, although some oblique moments painted the free-spirited, comic deputy with a darker tone. Newly O'Brien was named after a physician uncle who had ignited his interest in medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Dillon and Miss Kitty clearly had a close personal relationship, the two never married. In a July 2, 2002, Associated Press interview with Bob Thomas, Arness explained, \\"If they were man and wife, it would make a lot of difference. The people upstairs decided it was better to leave the show as it was, which I totally agreed with.\\" In the episode \\"Waste,\\" featuring Johnny Whitaker as a boy with a prostitute mother, her madam questions Dillon as to why the law overlooks Miss Kitty's enterprise. It appears that bordellos could exist \\"at the law's discretion,\\" (meaning the marshal's). As an historical matter, prior to the First World War, few laws criminalized prostitution in the United States.[27] The nearest that Matt and Miss Kitty have a romantic evening together is a when they try to have dinner over the Long Branch Saloon (\\"A Quiet Day In Dodge.\\" 1973) Unfortunately, Marshal Dillon has been going over 30 hours without sleep, and when Kitty is distracted, Matt falls soundly asleep.[28] Ironically the nearest Miss Kitty gets to being \\"married\\" is when she has to pretend to be married to Cavalry Sgt. Holly in order to save her from a robber gang (\\"Sergeant Holly,\\" 1970). By the time of the \\"Gold Train\\" episode Kitty remembers when she first met Matt ÿ 17 years before. Miss Kitty was written out in 1974. The actress sought more free time and reportedly missed her late co-star, Glenn Strange, who played her Long Branch barkeep, Sam. When Blake decided not to return for the show's 20th (and final) season, the character was said to have returned to New Orleans. She was replaced by the hoarse-voiced, matronly actress Fran Ryan (known to many as the second Doris Ziffel on CBS's Green Acres.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor over a decade on television, a sign hung over Doc's office that read \\"Dr. G. Adams\\". Milburn Stone was given free rein to choose the character's first name. The actor chose the name of an ancient Greek physician and medical researcher named Galen. He is first referred to in this manner by Theodore Bikel as \\"Martin Kellums\\" in the season-10 episode, \\"Song for Dying,\\" aired February 13, 1965.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferences were noted between the characters on the radio and TV versions of Gunsmoke. In the radio series, Doc was acerbic, somewhat mercenary, and borderline alcoholicat least in the program's early years. On radio's Gunsmoke, Doc Adams's real name was Dr. Calvin Moore.[30] He came west and changed his name to escape a charge of murder. The television Doc, though still crusty, was in many ways softer and warmer.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing in the radio series suggested that Chester Proudfoot was disabled; this merely visual feature was added to the Chester Goode character on television because of actor Dennis Weaver's athletic build, to emphasize Chester's role as a follower and not an independent agent.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Kitty, who after the radio series ended, was said by some to have engaged in prostitution, began in that role in the television series, working in the Long Branch Saloon. In an earlier 1956 episode (\\"How to Cure a Friend\\" Season 2, #7), the owner of the Long Branch was named Bill Pence (a role played by at least three different actors over the years). A later episode (\\"Daddy O\\" Season 2, #36, filmed in 1956 and aired in 1957 )begins with Chester pointing out to Matt (who had been out of town) a new sign under the Long Branch Saloon sign stating \\"Russell & Pence, Proprietors\\". In that same episode, John Dehner portrayed a dubious New Orleans businessman claiming to be Kitty's father, who tried to talk her into selling her half interest in the Long Branch and returning to New Orleans with him as a partner in his alleged freight business. In another 1956 episode (involving a new saloon girl named \\"Rena Decker\\" who causes four deaths by provoking men into fighting over her), Miss Kitty identifies herself as half-owner of the Long Branch with Mr. Pence (played by Judson Pratt). Subsequently, Miss Kitty transitioned to sole owner. Although early film episodes showed her descending from her second-floor rooms in the saloon with Matt, or showed her or one of her girls leading a cowboy up to those same rooms, these scenes disappeared later on, and viewers were guided to see Miss Kitty just as a kindhearted businesswoman.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1955 to 1961, Gunsmoke was a half-hour show (retitled Marshal Dillon in syndication). It then went to an hour-long format. The series was retitled Gun Law in the UK. The Marshal Dillon syndicated rerun lasted from 1961 until 1964 on CBS, originally on Tuesday nights within its time in reruns.\\r\\n\\r\\nGunsmoke was TV's number one-ranked show from 1957 to 1961 before slipping into a decline after expanding to an hour. In 1967, the show's 12th season, CBS planned to cancel the series, but widespread viewer reaction (including a mention in Congress and the behind-the-scenes pressure from the wife of CBS's longtime president William S. Paley) prevented its demise. On the Biography Channel's Behind The Scenes: Gilligan's Island (2002); Gilligan's Island producer Sherwood Schwartz states that the wife of CBS's president pressured her husband not to cancel Gunsmoke in 1967, so the network cut Gilligan's Island instead. The show continued in its new time slot at 8?pm on Mondays. This scheduling move led to a spike in ratings that had it once again rally to the top 10 in the Nielsen ratings until the 1973ÿ74 television season.[31] In September 1975, despite still ranking among the top 30 programs in the ratings, Gunsmoke was canceled after a 20-year run; it was replaced by Mary Tyler Moore spin-offs Rhoda and Phyllis (though Rhoda actually debuted while Gunsmoke was still airing first-run). Thirty TV Westerns came and went during its 20-year tenure, and Gunsmoke was the sole survivor, with Alias Smith and Jones and Bonanza both leaving the airwaves 2 - 1/2 years earlier in January 1973.\\r\\n\\r\\nArness and Stone remained with the show for its entire run, though Stone missed seven episodes in 1971, due to illness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire cast was stunned by the cancellation, as they were unaware that CBS was considering it. According to Arness, \\"We didn't do a final, wrap-up show. We finished the 20th year, we all expected to go on for another season, or two or three. The (network) never told anybody they were thinking of canceling.\\" The cast and crew read the news in the trade papers.[32]  This seemed to have been a habit of CBS.  Three other popular shows, Gilligan's Island, Lost in Space and The Incredible Hulk met the same fate, in the same, abrupt manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1987, CBS commissioned a reunion movie entitled Gunsmoke: Return to Dodge. James Arness and Amanda Blake returned in their iconic roles of Matt Dillon and Miss Kitty, with Fran Ryan returning in her role as Kitty's friend/saloon-owner Hannah and Buck Taylor returning as Newly O'Brian. Doc Adams and Festus Haggen were not featured in the film. Milburn Stone died 7 years earlier in 1980 and the role of Doc was not recast. Ken Curtis, meanwhile, balked at the salary offer he received and said that he should be paid based on Festus' importance in the character hierarchy. The screenwriters responded to Curtis' absence by making Newly the new Dodge City marshal. The film, shot in Alberta, featured a now-retired Marshal Dillon being attacked and a vengeful former rival returning to Dodge City to entrap him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, the second telefilm, Gunsmoke: The Last Apache, premiered. Since Amanda Blake had died the year before, the writers decided to revisit a 1973 episode for the movie. The episode was based on \\"Matt's Love Story\\", which was noted for the marshal's first overnight visit to a female's lodgings.[citation needed] In the episode, Matt loses his memory and his heart, during a brief liaison with \\"Mike\\" Yardner (played by Michael Learned). In the film, Learned returned and Mike reveals to Marshal Dillon that he is the father of their daughter[33] Beth (played by Amy Stock-Poynton) and asks him for help in saving her. Dodge City was never again seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther films included Gunsmoke: To the Last Man (1992), Gunsmoke IV: The Long Ride (1993), and Gunsmoke: One Man's Justice (1994). Arness appeared in all five films.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll 635 episodes of the television series, and almost all 480 episodes of the radio show, still exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn syndication, the entire 20-year run of Gunsmoke is separated into three packages by CBS Television Distribution:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, as part of Gunsmoke's 50th anniversary on TV, certain selected episodes were released on DVD in three different box sets. Twelve episodes, from 1955 to 1964, were selected for the Gunsmoke: Volume I box set, and another twelve episodes, from 1964 to 1975, were selected for the Gunsmoke: Volume II box set. Both sets are also available as a combined single \\"Gift Box Set\\". A third unique DVD box set, known as Gunsmoke: The Directors Collection, was also released with 10 selected episodes from certain seasons throughout the series' 20-year history. All of these box sets are available on Region 1 DVD from Paramount Home Entertainment and CBS DVD.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, Paramount Home Entertainment and CBS DVD have released the first 13 seasons (seasons one to six are known as the \\"half-hour years\\") on DVD in Region 1.

It has been confused in the past as the basis for the series but has been proven since to have no connection with the show, or radio series , with the exception that all are westerns.\\r\\n\\r\\nGunsmoke had one spin-off series, Dirty Sally, a semi-comedy starring Jeanette Nolan as an old woman and Dack Rambo as a young gunfighter, leaving Dodge City for California in order to pan for gold. The program lasted thirteen weeks and aired in the first half of 1974, a year before Gunsmoke ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gunsmoke radio theme song and later TV theme was titled \\"Old Trails\\", also known as \\"Boothill\\". The Gunsmoke theme was composed by Rex Koury.[53] The original radio version was conducted by Koury. The TV version was thought to have been first conducted by CBS west coast music director Lud Gluskin. The lyrics of the theme, never aired on the radio or television show, were recorded and released by Tex Ritter in 1955. Ritter was backed on that Capitol record by Rex Koury and the radio Gunsmoke orchestra.[54]  William Lava composed the original theme music for television, as noted in the program credits.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther notable composers included:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gunsmoke brand was used to endorse numerous products, from cottage cheese[55] to cigarettes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLowell Toy Manufacturing Corporation (\\"It's a Lowell Game\\") issued Gunsmoke as their game No. 822.[56] Other products include Gunsmoke puzzles,[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1985, Capcom released a video game for the arcade (and its corresponding game for the NES in 1988) with a Western theme, called Gun.Smoke. Other than the Western theme, the show and game have no relationship whatsoever.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndependent E-book\\r\\n\\r\\nThe program currently airs on three major venues: TV Land, which has carried the show since its inception in 1996, Encore Westerns, and Weigel Broadcasting's MeTV digital subchannel network. Individual stations such as KFWD in Dallas also carry the series in their markets. It has also been shown on satellite channel CBS Action in the UK, Ireland and Poland. The series also appears intermittently on MeTV's themed sister network Decades, which CBS holds a partial interest in; it appears on the schedule depending on the theme and year a particular day has.","input":"How long did gunsmoke stay on the air?"},{"output":"starch","context":"Prawn crackers, also known as prawn chips and shrimp puffs are deep fried crackers made from starch and prawn that serve as flavoring.\\r\\nThey are a popular snack in parts of Southeast and East Asia. Prawn crackers are a common snack food throughout Southeast Asia, but most closely associated with Indonesia and Malaysia.[1][2] These are called krupuk udang in Indonesian, prawn crackers in British English and shrimp chips or Prawn crackers in American English. They are known as kroepoek (old Indonesian spelling for krupuk, based on Dutch spelling rules) in Dutch, Krabbenchips (crab chips) in German, chips  la crevette in French, nuvole di drago (dragon clouds) in Italian, and pan de gambas (shrimp bread) in Spanish. There are also Japanese (̫) and Korean (???) shrimp chips which are a popular snack in both countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrawn cracker is called krupuk udang in Indonesian, and is merely one variant of many sorts of krupuk recognised in Indonesian cuisine. In Indonesia the term krupuk or kerupuk is used as umbrella term to refer to this kind of cracker. Indonesia has perhaps the largest variety of krupuk.[3]\\r\\nKrupuk udang (prawn cracker) and other types of krupuk are ubiquitous in Indonesia. The examples of popular krupuk udang brands in Indonesia is Finna[4] and Komodo brand. To achieve maximum crunchiness, most of this pre-packed raw krupuk udang must be sun-dried first before being deep fried at home. To cook krupuk, a wok and plenty of very hot cooking oil is needed. Raw krupuk is quite small, hard, and darker in color than cooked one.[5] Fishing towns of Sidoarjo in East Java, also Cirebon in West Java, are major producers of krupuk udang.\\r\\nPrawn crackers are one of the most popular snacks in Malaysia and are particularly served at homes of many during festive celebration (such as the Chinese New Year and Hari Raya) being a crowd-pleasing snack, this type of cracker can be found in many groceries stores and supermarkets, examples of popular household brands in Malaysia are Rota Prawn Crackers by OFI Sdn. Bhd. and myReal Pulau Pangkor Prawn Crackers[6] by Lumut Crackers Sdn. Bhd.. One of the most popular type of prawn cracker in Malaysia are the Keropok Udang Geragau Melaka.[7][8]\\r\\nSa Dec in southern Vietnam is the home of bnh ph?ng t?m. The traditional snack is made of ground shrimp, sometimes mixed with cuttlefish, arrowroot flour, tapioca flour, onion, garlic, sugar, fish sauce, cracked black pepper and salt.[9] Traditionally the dough is steamed, rolled out, cut into round chips then dried. Another method is to form rolls, steam and then slice into thin rounds before being dried. Modern production favours the oval shapes such that the chips form a \\"scooper\\" as an accompaniment to salads (g?i and n?m). The brand Sa Giang is well known.\\r\\nA variant is bnh ph?ng n?m flavoured with n?m h??ng (shiitake) or n?m r?m (straw mushroom).[10]\\r\\nIn Chinese cuisine, prawn crackers may use food colouring (including shades of white, pale pink, green and blue), and tend to be lighter and non-spicy. However, in China they are easy to find in supermarkets, yet not popular or common in restaurants or when serving food for friends.\\r\\nPrawn crackers are considered a snack food, but may accompany takeaway Chinese food in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. Shrimp chips are usually served with roasted chicken dishes in Chinese restaurants overseas.[citation needed] There is also a vegan version available that does not contain seafood.\\r\\nThrough their historical colonial ties with Indonesia, the Dutch are familiar with Indonesian foodstuffs including the Indonesian prawn crackers. Assorted types of krupuk (Dutch: kroepoek), deep fried crackers made from starch and flavourings, such as prawn or crab, are available in many Indische, or Indo, (Dutch-Indonesian) shops in the Netherlands, which locally are called toko. Prawn crackers are also available in many of the major supermarkets. Kroepoek is a standard part of the repertoire of \\"Indische\\" (a word referring to the former Dutch East Indies, present day Indonesia; not to be confused with the Dutch word Indiaas, meaning \\"from India\\") restaurants in the Netherlands. It is also served in Chinese restaurants in Belgium and in the Netherlands.\\r\\nThey are also known as prawn crackers or prawn chips in Australia, where they are popular in many Asian restaurants. They are usually coloured pink with a salty flavour and are usually treated as a side dish, entre or snack.\\r\\nPrawn crackers are made by mixing prawns, tapioca flour and water. The mixture is rolled out, steamed, sliced and sun-dried. In the traditional way, to achieve maximum crispiness, raw crackers are usually sun-dried first before frying, to eliminate the moisture. Once dry, they are deep-fried in oil (which must be at high heat before cooking). In only a few seconds they expand from thumb-sized semi-transparent chips to white fluffy crackers, much like popcorn, as water bound to the starch expands as it turns into steam. If left in the open air for more than a few hours (depending on humidity), they start to soften and become chewy and are therefore ideally consumed within a few hours of being fried. Storing the crackers in a low humidity environment or an airtight container will preserve the crispness. Packets of unfried prawn crackers may be purchased in oriental stores, or stores that specialise in Asian cuisine. In the Netherlands, Belgium, Suriname, France, Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom they are also widely available in general supermarkets.\\r\\nPrawn crackers of premium quality are aromatic even without additives such as monosodium glutamate (MSG) and artificial prawn flavourings to enhance the smell and taste. The fried prawn crackers may be stored in airtight container for up to 3 months without preservatives and up to 9 months or so depending on the amount of preservatives added.\\r\\nMost varieties of prawn crackers can also be prepared in a microwave oven, in which a few discs can be cooked in less than a minute. This will usually cause them to cook and expand in a way similar to when they are deep fried. For small quantities, this method is faster and less messy, as the crackers do not become as oily. However, this may cause the cracker to retain a stronger aroma of raw shrimp and the cracker has to be consumed within hours before it softens and loses its crispness.","input":"What is a prawn cracker made out of?"},{"output":"Emperor Nicholas II","context":"The Russian Revolution was a pair of revolutions in Russia in 1917 which dismantled the Tsarist autocracy and led to the rise of the Soviet Union. The Russian Empire collapsed with the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II and the old regime was replaced by a provisional government during the first revolution of February 1917 (March in the Gregorian calendar; the older Julian calendar was in use in Russia at the time). Alongside it arose grassroots community assemblies (called 'soviets') which contended for authority. In the second revolution that October, the Provisional Government was toppled and all power was given to the soviets.\\r\\nThe February Revolution (March 1917) was a revolution focused around Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg), the capital of Russia at that time. In the chaos, members of the Imperial parliament (the Duma) assumed control of the country, forming the Russian Provisional Government which was heavily dominated by the interests of large capitalists and the noble aristocracy. The army leadership felt they did not have the means to suppress the revolution, resulting in Nicholas's abdication. The soviets, which were dominated by soldiers and the urban industrial working class, initially permitted the Provisional Government to rule, but insisted on a prerogative to influence the government and control various militias. The February Revolution took place in the context of heavy military setbacks during the First World War (1914ÿ18), which left much of the Russian Army in a state of mutiny.\\r\\nA period of dual power ensued, during which the Provisional Government held state power while the national network of soviets, led by socialists, had the allegiance of the lower classes and, increasingly, the left-leaning urban middle class. During this chaotic period there were frequent mutinies, protests and many strikes. Many socialist political organizations were engaged in daily struggle and vied for influence within the Duma and the soviets, central among which were the Bolsheviks (\\"Ones of the Majority\\") led by Vladimir Lenin who campaigned for an immediate end to the war, land to the peasants, and bread to the workers. When the Provisional Government chose to continue fighting the war with Germany, the Bolsheviks and other socialist factions were able to exploit virtually universal disdain towards the war effort as justification to advance the revolution further. The Bolsheviks turned workers' militias under their control into the Red Guards (later the Red Army) over which they exerted substantial control.[1]\\r\\nIn the October Revolution (November in the Gregorian calendar), the Bolsheviks led an armed insurrection by workers and soldiers in Petrograd that successfully overthrew the Provisional Government, transferring all its authority to the soviets with the capital being relocated to Moscow shortly thereafter. The Bolsheviks had secured a strong base of support within the soviets and, as the now supreme governing party, established a federal government dedicated to reorganizing the former empire into the world's first socialist republic, practicing soviet democracy on a national and international scale. The promise to end Russias participation in the First World War was honored promptly with the Bolshevik leaders signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany in March 1918. To further secure the new state, the Cheka was established which functioned as a revolutionary security service that sought to weed out and punish those considered to be \\"enemies of the people\\" in campaigns consciously modeled on similar events during the French Revolution.\\r\\nSoon after, civil war erupted among the \\"Reds\\" (Bolsheviks), the \\"Whites\\" (counter-revolutionaries), the independence movements and the non-Bolshevik socialists. It continued for several years, during which the Bolsheviks defeated both the Whites and all rival socialists and thereafter reconstituted themselves as the Communist Party. In this way, the Revolution paved the way for the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1922. While many notable historical events occurred in Moscow and Petrograd, there was also a visible movement in cities throughout the state, among national minorities throughout the empire and in the rural areas, where peasants took over and redistributed land.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian Revolution of 1905 was said to be a major factor contributing to the cause of the Revolutions of 1917. The events of Bloody Sunday triggered nationwide protests and soldier mutinies. A council of workers called the St. Petersburg Soviet was created in this chaos.[2] While the 1905 Revolution was ultimately crushed, and the leaders of the St. Petersburg Soviet were arrested, this laid the groundwork for the later Petrograd Soviet and other revolutionary movements during the leadup to 1917. The 1905 Revolution also led to the creation of a Duma (parliament), that would later form the Provisional Government following February 1917.[3]\\r\\nThe outbreak World War I prompted general outcry directed at Tsar Nicholas II and the Romanov family. While the nation was initially caught up in a wave of nationalism, increasing numbers of defeats and poor conditions soon made the opposite true. The Tsar attempted to remedy the situation by taking personal control of the army in 1915. This proved disastrous, as the Tsar was now held personally responsible for Russia's continuing defeats and losses. In addition, the Tsarina Alexandra, left to rule in while the Tsar was commanding at the front, was German born, leading to suspicion of collusion, only exacerbated by rumors relating to her relationship with the controversial mystic Rasputin. Rasputin's influence led to disastrous ministerial appointments and corruption, resulting in a worsening of conditions within Russia. This led to general dissatisfaction with the Romanov family, and was a major factor contributing to the retaliation of the Russian Communists against the royal family.[3]\\r\\nAfter the entry of the Ottoman Empire on the side of the Central Powers in October 1914, Russia was deprived of a major trade route through the Dardanelles, which further contributed to the economic crisis, in which Russia became incapable of providing munitions to their army in the years leading to 1917. However, the problems were primarily administrative, and not industrial, as Germany was producing great amounts of munitions whilst constantly fighting on two major battlefronts.[4]\\r\\nThe conditions during the war resulted in devastating loss of morale within the Russian army, as well as the general population. This was particularly apparent in the cities, owing to a lack of food in response to the disruption of agriculture. Food scarcity had become a considerable problem in Russia, but the cause of this did not lie in any failure of the harvests, which had not been significantly altered during wartime. The indirect reason was that the government, in order to finance the war, had been printing millions of ruble notes, and by 1917 inflation had made prices increase up to four times what they had been in 1914. Farmers were consequently faced with a higher cost of living, but little increase in income. As a result, they tended to hoard their grain and to revert to subsistence farming. Thus the cities were constantly short of food. At the same time, rising prices led to demands for higher wages in the factories, and in January and February 1916 revolutionary propaganda, in part aided by German funds, led to widespread strikes. This resulted in a growing criticism of the government, including an increased participation of workers in revolutionary parties.\\r\\nLiberal parties too had an increased platform to voice their complaints, as the initial fervor of the war had resulted in the Tsarist government creating a variety of political organizations. In July 1915, a Central War Industries Committee was established under the chairmanship of a prominent Octobrist, Alexander Guchkov (1862-1936), including ten workers' representatives. The Petrograd Mensheviks agreed to join despite the objections of their leaders abroad. All this activity gave renewed encouragement to political ambitions, and, in September 1915, a combination of Octobrists and Kadets in the Duma demanded the forming of a responsible government. The Tsar rejected these proposals.[5]\\r\\nAll these factors had given rise to a sharp loss of confidence in the regime, even within the ruling class, growing throughout the war. Early in 1916, Guchkov discussed with senior army officers and members of the Central War Industries Committee about a possible coup to force the abdication of the Tsar. In December, a small group of nobles assassinated Rasputin, and in January 1917 the Tsar's uncle, Grand Duke Nicholas, was asked indirectly by Prince Lvov whether he would be prepared to take over the throne from his nephew, Tsar Nicholas II. None of these incidents were in themselves the immediate cause of the February Revolution, but they do help to explain why the monarchy survived only a few days after it had broken out.[5]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Socialist Revolutionary leaders in exile, many of them living in Switzerland, had been the glum spectators of the collapse of international socialist solidarity. French and German Social Democrats had voted in favour of their respective governments' war efforts. Georgi Plekhanov in Paris had adopted a violently anti-German stand, while Parvus supported the German war effort as the best means of ensuring a revolution in Russia. The Mensheviks largely maintained that Russia had the right to defend herself against Germany, although Martov (a prominent Menshevik), now on the left of his group, demanded an end to the war and a settlement on the basis of national self-determination, with no annexations or indemnities.[5]\\r\\nIt was these views of Martov that predominated in a manifesto drawn up by Leon Trotsky (at the time a Menshevik) at a conference in Zimmerwald, attended by 35 Socialist leaders in September 1915. Inevitably Vladimir Lenin, supported by Zinoviev and Radek, strongly contested them. Their attitudes became known as the Zimmerwald Left. Lenin rejected both the defence of Russia and the cry for peace. Since the autumn of 1914, he had insisted that \\"from the standpoint of the working class and of the labouring masses from the lesser evil would be the defeat of the Tsarist Monarchy\\"; the war must be turned into a civil war of the proletarian soldiers against their own governments, and if a proletarian victory should emerge from this in Russia, then their duty would be to wage a revolutionary war for the liberation of the masses throughout Europe.[6]\\r\\nAn elementary theory of property, believed by many peasants, was that land should belong to those who work on it. At the same time, peasant life and culture was changing constantly. Change was facilitated by the physical movement of growing numbers of peasant villagers who migrated to and from industrial and urban environments, but also by the introduction of city culture into the village through material goods, the press, and word of mouth.[nb 1]\\r\\nWorkers also had good reasons for discontent: overcrowded housing with often deplorable sanitary conditions, long hours at work (on the eve of the war a 10-hour workday six days a week was the average and many were working 11ÿ12 hours a day by 1916), constant risk of injury and death from poor safety and sanitary conditions, harsh discipline (not only rules and fines, but foremen's fists), and inadequate wages (made worse after 1914 by steep wartime increases in the cost of living). At the same time, urban industrial life was full of benefits, though these could be just as dangerous, from the point of view of social and political stability, as the hardships. There were many encouragements to expect more from life. Acquiring new skills gave many workers a sense of self-respect and confidence, heightening expectations and desires. Living in cities, workers encountered material goods such as they had never seen in villages. Most important, living in cities, they were exposed to new ideas about the social and political order.[nb 2]\\r\\nThe social causes of the Russian Revolution mainly came from centuries of oppression of the lower classes by the Tsarist regime, and Nicholas's failures in World War I. While rural agrarian peasants had been emancipated from serfdom in 1861, they still resented paying redemption payments to the state, and demanded communal tender of the land they worked. The problem was further compounded by the failure of Sergei Witte's land reforms of the early 20th century. Increasing peasant disturbances and sometimes actual revolts occurred, with the goal of securing ownership of the land they worked. Russia consisted mainly of poor farming peasants, with 1.5% of the population owning 25% of the land.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe rapid industrialization of Russia also resulted in urban overcrowding and poor conditions for urban industrial workers (as mentioned above). Between 1890 and 1910, the population of the capital, Saint Petersburg, swelled from 1,033,600 to 1,905,600, with Moscow experiencing similar growth. This created a new 'proletariat' which, due to being crowded together in the cities, was much more likely to protest and go on strike than the peasantry had been in previous times. In one 1904 survey, it was found that an average of sixteen people shared each apartment in Saint Petersburg, with six people per room. There was also no running water, and piles of human waste were a threat to the health of the workers. The poor conditions only aggravated the situation, with the number of strikes and incidents of public disorder rapidly increasing in the years shortly before World War I. Because of late industrialization, Russia's workers were highly concentrated. By 1914, 40% of Russian workers were employed in factories of 1,000+ workers (32% in 1901). 42% worked in 100ÿ1,000 worker enterprises, 18% in 1ÿ100 worker businesses (in the USA, 1914, the figures were 18, 47 and 35 respectively).[7]\\r\\nWorld War I added to the chaos. Conscription swept up the unwilling across Russia. The vast demand for factory production of war supplies and workers caused many more labor riots and strikes. Conscription stripped skilled workers from the cities, who had to be replaced with unskilled peasants, and then, when famine began to hit due to the poor railway system, workers abandoned the cities in droves seeking food. Finally, the soldiers themselves, who suffered from a lack of equipment and protection from the elements, began to turn against the Tsar. This was mainly because, as the war progressed, many of the officers who were loyal to the Tsar were killed, and were replaced by discontented conscripts from the major cities, who had little loyalty to the Tsar.\\r\\nMany sections of the country had reason to be dissatisfied with the existing autocracy. Nicholas II was a deeply conservative ruler and maintained a strict authoritarian system. Individuals and society in general were expected to show self-restraint, devotion to community, deference to the social hierarchy and a sense of duty to the country. Religious faith helped bind all of these tenets together as a source of comfort and reassurance in the face of difficult conditions and as a means of political authority exercised through the clergy. Perhaps more than any other modern monarch, Nicholas II attached his fate and the future of his dynasty to the notion of the ruler as a saintly and infallible father to his people.[nb 3]\\r\\nThis idealized vision of the Romanov monarchy blinded him to the actual state of his country. With a firm belief that his power to rule was granted by Divine Right, Nicholas assumed that the Russian people were devoted to him with unquestioning loyalty. This ironclad belief rendered Nicholas unwilling to allow the progressive reforms that might have alleviated the suffering of the Russian people. Even after the 1905 revolution spurred the Tsar to decree limited civil rights and democratic representation, he worked to limit even these liberties in order to preserve the ultimate authority of the crown.[nb 3]\\r\\nDespite constant oppression, the desire of the people for democratic participation in government decisions was strong. Since the Age of Enlightenment, Russian intellectuals had promoted Enlightenment ideals such as the dignity of the individual and the rectitude of democratic representation. These ideals were championed most vociferously by Russias liberals, although populists, Marxists, and anarchists also claimed to support democratic reforms. A growing opposition movement had begun to challenge the Romanov monarchy openly well before the turmoil of World War I.\\r\\nDissatisfaction with Russian autocracy culminated in the huge national upheaval that followed the Bloody Sunday massacre of January 1905, in which hundreds of unarmed protesters were shot by the Tsar's troops. Workers responded to the massacre with a crippling general strike, forcing Nicholas to put forth the October Manifesto, which established a democratically elected parliament (the State Duma). The Tsar undermined this promise of reform but a year later with Article 87 of the 1906 Fundamental State Laws, and subsequently dismissed the first two Dumas when they proved uncooperative. Unfulfilled hopes of democracy fueled revolutionary ideas and violent outbursts targeted at the monarchy.\\r\\nOne of the Tsars principal rationales for risking war in 1914 was his desire to restore the prestige that Russia had lost amid the debacles of the Russo-Japanese war. Nicholas also sought to foster a greater sense of national unity with a war against a common and ancient enemy. The Russian Empire was an agglomeration of diverse ethnicities that had shown significant signs of disunity in the years before the First World War. Nicholas believed in part that the shared peril and tribulation of a foreign war would mitigate the social unrest over the persistent issues of poverty, inequality, and inhuman working conditions. Instead of restoring Russia's political and military standing, World War I led to the horrifying slaughter of Russian troops and military defeats that undermined both the monarchy and society in general to the point of collapse.\\r\\nThe outbreak of war in August 1914 initially served to quiet the prevalent social and political protests, focusing hostilities against a common external enemy, but this patriotic unity did not last long. As the war dragged on inconclusively, war-weariness gradually took its toll. More important, though, was a deeper fragility: although many ordinary Russians joined anti-German demonstrations in the first few weeks of the war, the most widespread reaction appears to have been skepticism and fatalism. Hostility toward the Kaiser and the desire to defend their land and their lives did not necessarily translate into enthusiasm for the Tsar or the government.[9][10][11]\\r\\nRussia's first major battle of the war was a disaster: in the 1914 Battle of Tannenberg, over 30,000 Russian troops were killed or wounded and 90,000 captured, while Germany suffered just 12,000 casualties. However, Austro-Hungarian forces allied to Germany were driven back deep into the Galicia region by the end of the year. In the autumn of 1915, Nicholas had taken direct command of the army, personally overseeing Russia's main theatre of war and leaving his ambitious but incapable wife Alexandra in charge of the government. Reports of corruption and incompetence in the Imperial government began to emerge, and the growing influence of Grigori Rasputin in the Imperial family was widely resented. In the eyes of Michael Lynch, a revisionist historian (member of the School of Historical Studies at the University of Leicester) who focuses on the role of the people, Rasputin was a \\"fatal disease\\" to the Tsarist regime.\\r\\nIn 1915, things took a critical turn for the worse when Germany shifted its focus of attack to the Eastern front. The superior German army?ÿ better led, better trained and better supplied?ÿ was terrifyingly effective against the ill-equipped Russian forces, driving the Russians out of Galicia, as well as Russian Poland, during the GorliceÿTarn܇w Offensive campaign. By the end of October 1916, Russia had lost between 1,600,000 and 1,800,000 soldiers, with an additional 2,000,000 prisoners of war and 1,000,000 missing, all making up a total of nearly 5,000,000 men.\\r\\nThese staggering losses played a definite role in the mutinies and revolts that began to occur. In 1916, reports of fraternizing with the enemy started to circulate. Soldiers went hungry, and lacked shoes, munitions, and even weapons. Rampant discontent lowered morale, which was further undermined by a series of military defeats.\\r\\nCasualty rates were the most vivid sign of this disaster. Already, by the end of 1914, only five months into the war, around 390,000 Russian men had lost their lives and nearly 1,000,000 were injured. Far sooner than expected, barely trained recruits had to be called up for active duty, a process repeated throughout the war as staggering losses continued to mount. The officer class also saw remarkable changes, especially within the lower echelons, which were quickly filled with soldiers rising up through the ranks. These men, usually of peasant or working-class backgrounds, were to play a large role in the politicization of the troops in 1917.\\r\\nThe huge losses on the battlefields were not limited to men. The army quickly ran short of rifles and ammunition (as well as uniforms and food), and, by mid-1915, men were being sent to the front bearing no arms. It was hoped that they could equip themselves with the arms that they recovered from fallen soldiers, of both sides, on the battlefields. The soldiers did not feel that they were being treated as human beings, or even as valuable soldiers, but rather as raw materials to be squandered for the purposes of the rich and powerful.\\r\\nBy the spring of 1915, the army was in steady retreat, which was not always orderly; desertion, plunder and chaotic flight were not uncommon. By 1916, however, the situation had improved in many respects. Russian troops stopped retreating, and there were even some modest successes in the offensives that were staged that year, albeit at great loss of life. Also, the problem of shortages was largely solved by a major effort to increase domestic production. Nevertheless, by the end of 1916, morale among soldiers was even worse than it had been during the great retreat of 1915. The fortunes of war may have improved, but the fact of the war, still draining away strength and lives from the country and its many individuals and families, remained an oppressive inevitability. The crisis in morale (as was argued by Allan Wildman, a leading historian of the Russian army in war and revolution) \\"was rooted fundamentally in the feeling of utter despair that the slaughter would ever end and that anything resembling victory could be achieved.\\"[12]\\r\\nThe war devastated not only soldiers. By the end of 1915, there were manifold signs that the economy was breaking down under the heightened strain of wartime demand. The main problems were food shortages and rising prices. Inflation dragged incomes down at an alarmingly rapid rate, and shortages made it difficult to buy even what one could afford. These shortages were a problem especially in the capital, St. Petersburg, where distance from supplies and poor transportation networks made matters particularly bad. Shops closed early or entirely for lack of bread, sugar, meat and other provisions, and lines lengthened massively for what remained. It became increasingly difficult both to afford and actually buy food.\\r\\nNot surprisingly, strikes increased steadily from the middle of 1915, and so did crime; but, for the most part, people suffered and endured, scouring the city for food. Working class women in St. Petersburg reportedly spent about forty hours a week in food lines, begging, turning to prostitution or crime, tearing down wooden fences to keep stoves heated for warmth, grumbling about the rich, and wondering when and how this would all come to an end.\\r\\nGovernment officials responsible for public order worried about how long people's patience would last. A report by the St. Petersburg branch of the security police, the Okhrana, in October 1916, warned bluntly of \\"the possibility in the near future of riots by the lower classes of the empire enraged by the burdens of daily existence.\\"[13]\\r\\nNicholas was blamed for all of these crises, and what little support he had left began to crumble. As discontent grew, the State Duma issued a warning to Nicholas in November 1916. It stated that, inevitably, a terrible disaster would grip the country unless a constitutional form of government was put in place. Nicholas ignored these warnings and Russia's Tsarist regime collapsed a few months later during the February Revolution of 1917. One year later, the Tsar and his entire family were executed.\\r\\nAt the beginning of February, Petrograd workers began several strikes and demonstrations.[citation needed] On 7 March [O.S. 22 February], workers at Putilov, Petrograd's largest industrial plant, announced a strike.[14]\\r\\nThe next day, a series of meetings and rallies were held for International Women's Day, which gradually turned into economic and political gatherings. Demonstrations were organised to demand bread, and these were supported by the industrial working force who considered them a reason for continuing the strikes. The women workers marched to nearby factories bringing out over 50,000 workers on strike.[15] By 10 March [O.S. 25 February], virtually every industrial enterprise in Petrograd had been shut down, together with many commercial and service enterprises. Students, white-collar workers and teachers joined the workers in the streets and at public meetings.[citation needed]\\r\\nTo quell the riots, the Tsar looked to the army. At least 180,000 troops were available in the capital, but most were either untrained or injured. Historian Ian Beckett suggests around 12,000 could be regarded as reliable, but even these proved reluctant to move in on the crowd, since it included so many women. It was for this reason that when, on 11 March [O.S. 26 February], the Tsar ordered the army to suppress the rioting by force, troops began to mutiny.[16] Although few actively joined the rioting, many officers were either shot or went into hiding; the ability of the garrison to hold back the protests was all but nullified, symbols of the Tsarist regime were rapidly torn down around the city, and governmental authority in the capital collapsed ÿ not helped by the fact that Nicholas had prorogued the Duma that morning, leaving it with no legal authority to act. The response of the Duma, urged on by the liberal bloc, was to establish a Temporary Committee to restore law and order; meanwhile, the socialist parties establish the Petrograd Soviet to represent workers and soldiers. The remaining loyal units switched allegiance the next day.[17]\\r\\nThe Tsar directed the royal train back towards Petrograd, which was stopped 14 March [O.S. 1 March],[16] by a group of revolutionaries at Malaya Vishera. When the Tsar finally arrived at in Pskov, the Army Chief Nikolai Ruzsky, and the Duma deputees Guchkov and Vasily Shulgin suggested in unison that he abdicate the throne. He did so on 15 March [O.S. 2 March], on behalf of himself, and then, having taken advice, on behalf of his son, the Tsarevich.[16] Nicholas nominated his brother, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, to succeed him. But the Grand Duke realised that he would have little support as ruler, so he declined the crown on 16 March [O.S. 3 March],[16] stating that he would take it only if that was the consensus of democratic action.[18] Six days later, Nicholas, no longer Tsar and addressed with contempt by the sentries as \\"Nicholas Romanov\\", was reunited with his family at the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo.[19] He was placed under house arrest with his family by the Provisional Government.\\r\\nThe immediate effect of the February Revolution was a widespread atmosphere of elation and excitement in Petrograd.[20] On 16 March [O.S. 3 March], a provisional government was announced. The center-left was well represented, and the government was initially chaired by a liberal aristocrat, Prince Georgy Yevgenievich Lvov, a member of the Constitutional Democratic party (KD).[21] The socialists had formed their rival body, the Petrograd Soviet (or workers' council) four days earlier. The Petrograd Soviet and the Provisional Government competed for power over Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effective power of the Provisional Government was challenged by the authority of an institution that claimed to represent the will of workers and soldiers and could, in fact, mobilize and control these groups during the early months of the revolution?ÿ the Petrograd Soviet [Council] of Workers' Deputies. The model for the soviet were workers' councils that had been established in scores of Russian cities during the 1905 Revolution. In February 1917, striking workers elected deputies to represent them and socialist activists began organizing a citywide council to unite these deputies with representatives of the socialist parties. On 27 February, socialist Duma deputies, mainly Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, took the lead in organizing a citywide council. The Petrograd Soviet met in the Tauride Palace, the same building where the new government was taking shape.\\r\\nThe leaders of the Petrograd Soviet believed that they represented particular classes of the population, not the whole nation. They also believed Russia was not ready for socialism. So they saw their role as limited to pressuring hesitant \\"bourgeoisie\\" to rule and to introduce extensive democratic reforms in Russia (the replacement of the monarchy by a republic, guaranteed civil rights, a democratic police and army, abolition of religious and ethnic discrimination, preparation of elections to a constituent assembly, and so on).[22] They met in the same building as the emerging Provisional Government not to compete with the Duma Committee for state power but to best exert pressure on the new government, to act, in other words, as a popular democratic lobby.\\r\\nThe relationship between these two major powers was complex from the beginning and would shape the politics of 1917. The representatives of the Provisional Government agreed to \\"take into account the opinions of the Soviet of Workers' Deputies\\", though they were also determined to prevent \\"interference in the actions of the government\\", which would create \\"an unacceptable situation of dual power.\\"[23] In fact, this was precisely what was being created, though this \\"dual power\\" (dvoevlastie) was the result less of the actions or attitudes of the leaders of these two institutions than of actions outside their control, especially the ongoing social movement taking place on the streets of Russias cities, in factories and shops, in barracks and in the trenches, and in the villages.\\r\\nA series of political crises?ÿ see the chronology below?ÿ in the relationship between population and government and between the Provisional Government and the soviets (which developed into a nationwide movement with a national leadership, The All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets (VTsIK)) undermined the authority of the Provisional Government but also of the moderate socialist leaders of the Soviet. Although the Soviet leadership initially refused to participate in the \\"bourgeois\\" Provisional Government, Alexander Kerensky, a young and popular lawyer and a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party (SRP), agreed to join the new cabinet, and became an increasingly central figure in the government, eventually taking leadership of the Provisional Government. As minister of war and later Prime Minister, Kerensky promoted freedom of speech, released thousands of political prisoners, did his very best to continue the war effort and even organised another offensive (which, however, was no more successful than its predecessors). Nevertheless, Kerensky still faced several great challenges, highlighted by the soldiers, urban workers and peasants, who claimed that they had gained nothing by the revolution:\\r\\nThe political group that proved most troublesome for Kerensky, and would eventually overthrow him, was the Bolshevik Party, led by Vladimir Lenin. Lenin had been living in exile in neutral Switzerland and, due to democratization of politics after the February Revolution, which legalized formerly banned political parties, he perceived the opportunity for his Marxist revolution. Although return to Russia had become a possibility, the war made it logistically difficult. Eventually, German officials arranged for Lenin to pass through their territory, hoping that his activities would weaken Russia or even?ÿ if the Bolsheviks came to power?ÿ led to Russia's withdrawal from the war. Lenin and his associates, however, had to agree to travel to Russia in a sealed train: Germany would not take the chance that he would foment revolution in Germany. After passing through the front, he arrived in Petrograd in April 1917.\\r\\nWith Lenin's arrival, the popularity of the Bolsheviks increased steadily. Over the course of the spring, public dissatisfaction with the Provisional Government and the war, in particular among workers, soldiers and peasants, pushed these groups to radical parties. Despite growing support for the Bolsheviks, buoyed by maxims that called most famously for \\"all power to the Soviets,\\" the party held very little real power in the moderate-dominated Petrograd Soviet. In fact, historians such as Sheila Fitzpatrick have asserted that Lenin's exhortations for the Soviet Council to take power were intended to arouse indignation both with the Provisional Government, whose policies were viewed as conservative, and the Soviet itself, which was viewed as subservient to the conservative government. By some historians' accounts, Lenin and his followers were unprepared for how their groundswell of support, especially among influential worker and soldier groups, would translate into real power in the summer of 1917.\\r\\nOn 18 June, the Provisional Government launched an attack against Germany that failed miserably. Soon after, the government ordered soldiers to go to the front, reneging on a promise. The soldiers refused to follow the new orders. The arrival of radical Kronstadt sailors?ÿ who had tried and executed many officers, including one admiral?ÿ further fueled the growing revolutionary atmosphere. The sailors and soldiers, along with Petrograd workers, took to the streets in violent protest, calling for \\"all power to the Soviets.\\" The revolt, however, was disowned by Lenin[24] and the Bolshevik leaders and dissipated within a few days. In the aftermath, Lenin fled to Finland under threat of arrest while Trotsky, among other prominent Bolsheviks, was arrested. The July Days confirmed the popularity of the anti-war, radical Bolsheviks, but their unpreparedness at the moment of revolt was an embarrassing gaffe that lost them support among their main constituent groups: soldiers and workers.\\r\\nThe Bolshevik failure in the July Days proved temporary. The Bolsheviks had undergone a spectacular growth in membership. Whereas, in February 1917, the Bolsheviks were limited to only 24,000 members, by September 1917 there were 200,000 members of the Bolshevik faction.[25] Previously, the Bolsheviks had been in the minority in the two leading cities of RussiaSt. Petersburg and Moscow behind the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries, by September the Bolsheviks were in the majority in both cities.[26] Furthermore, the Bolshevik-controlled Moscow Regional Bureau of the Party also controlled the Party organizations of the thirteen (13) provinces around Moscow. These thirteen provinces held 37% of Russia's population and 20% of the membership of the Bolshevik faction.[26]\\r\\nIn August, poor or misleading communication led General Lavr Kornilov, the recently appointed Supreme Commander of Russian military forces, to believe that the Petrograd government had already been captured by radicals, or was in serious danger thereof. In response, he ordered troops to Petrograd to pacify the city. To secure his position, Kerensky had to ask for Bolshevik assistance. He also sought help from the Petrograd Soviet, which called upon armed Red Guards to \\"defend the revolution\\". The Kornilov Affair failed largely due to the efforts of the Bolsheviks, whose influence over railroad and telegraph workers proved vital in stopping the movement of troops. With his coup failing, Kornilov surrendered and was relieved of his position. The Bolsheviks' role in stopping the attempted coup further strengthened their position.\\r\\nIn early September, the Petrograd Soviet freed all jailed Bolsheviks and Trotsky became chairman of the Petrograd Soviet. Growing numbers of socialists and lower-class Russians viewed the government less and less as a force in support of their needs and interests. The Bolsheviks benefited as the only major organized opposition party that had refused to compromise with the Provisional Government, and they benefited from growing frustration and even disgust with other parties, such as the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, who stubbornly refused to break with the idea of national unity across all classes.\\r\\nIn Finland, Lenin had worked on his book State and Revolution[27] and continued to lead his party, writing newspaper articles and policy decrees. By October, he returned to Petrograd (St. Petersburg), aware that the increasingly radical city presented him no legal danger and a second opportunity for revolution. Recognising the strength of the Bolsheviks, Lenin began pressing for the immediate overthrow of the Kerensky government by the Bolsheviks. Lenin was of the opinion that taking power should occur in both St. Petersburg and Moscow simultaneously, parenthetically stating that it made no difference which city rose up first, but expressing his opinion that Moscow may well rise up first.[28] The Bolshevik Central Committee drafted a resolution, calling for the dissolution of the Provisional Government in favor of the Petrograd Soviet. The resolution was passed 10ÿ2 (Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev prominently dissenting) and the October Revolution began.\\r\\nThe October Revolution was led by Vladimir Lenin and was based upon Lenin's writing on the ideas of Karl Marx, a political ideology often known as MarxismÿLeninism. It marked the beginning of the spread of communism in the 20th century. It was far less sporadic than the revolution of February and came about as the result of deliberate planning and coordinated activity to that end.\\r\\nThough Lenin was the leader of the Bolshevik Party, it has been argued that since Lenin was not present during the actual takeover of the Winter Palace, it was really Trotsky's organization and direction that led the revolution, merely spurred by the motivation Lenin instigated within his party.[29] Critics on the Right have long argued that the financial and logistical assistance of German intelligence via their key agent, Alexander Parvus was a key component as well, though historians are divided, since there is little evidence supporting that claim.\\r\\nOn 7 November 1917, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin led his leftist revolutionaries in a revolt against the ineffective Provisional Government (Russia was still using the Julian calendar at the time, so period references show a 25 October date). The October revolution ended the phase of the revolution instigated in February, replacing Russia's short-lived provisional parliamentary government with government by soviets, local councils elected by bodies of workers and peasants. Liberal and monarchist forces, loosely organized into the White Army, immediately went to war against the Bolsheviks' Red Army, in a series of battles that would become known as the Russian Civil War.\\r\\nSoviet membership was initially freely elected, but many members of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, anarchists, and other leftists created opposition to the Bolsheviks through the soviets themselves. When it became clear that the Bolsheviks had little support outside of the industrialized areas of Saint Petersburg and Moscow, they simply barred non-Bolsheviks from membership in the soviets.[citation needed] Not surprisingly, this caused mass domestic tension with many individuals who called for another series of political reform, revolting, and calling for \\"a third Russian revolution,\\" a movement that received a significant amount of support. The most notable instances of this anti-Bolshevik mentality were expressed in the Tambov rebellion, 1919ÿ1921, and the Kronstadt rebellion in March 1921. These movements, which made a wide range of demands and lacked effective coordination, were eventually defeated along with the White Army during the Civil War.\\r\\nThe Russian Civil War, which broke out in 1918 shortly after the revolution, brought death and suffering to millions of people regardless of their political orientation. The war was fought mainly between the Red Army (\\"Reds\\"), consisting of the uprising majority led by the Bolshevik minority, and the \\"Whites\\"?ÿ army officers and cossacks, the \\"bourgeoisie\\", and political groups ranging from the far Right to the Socialist Revolutionaries who opposed the drastic restructuring championed by the Bolsheviks following the collapse of the Provisional Government to the soviets (under clear Bolshevik dominance).[30][31] The Whites had backing from nations such as Great Britain, France, USA and Japan, while the Reds possessed internal support which proved to be much more effective. Though the Allied nations, using external interference, provided substantial military aid to the loosely knit anti-Bolshevik forces, they were ultimately defeated.[30]\\r\\nThe Bolsheviks firstly assumed power in Petrograd, expanding their rule outwards. They eventually reached the Easterly Siberian Russian coast in Vladivostok, 4 years after the war began, an occupation that is believed to have ended all significant military campaigns in the nation. Less than one year later the last area controlled by the White Army, the Ayano-Maysky District, directly to the north of the Krai containing Vladivostok, was given up when General Anatoly Pepelyayev capitulated in 1923.\\r\\nSeveral revolts were initiated against the Bolsheviks and their army near the end of the war, notably the Kronstadt Rebellion. This was a naval mutiny engineered by Soviet Baltic sailors, former Red Army soldiers, and the people of Kronstadt. This armed uprising was fought against the antagonizing Bolshevik economic policies that farmers were subjected to, including seizures of grain crops by the Communists.[32] This all amounted to large-scale discontent. When delegates representing the Kronstadt sailors arrived at Petrograd for negotiations, they raised 15 demands primarily pertaining to the Russian right to freedom.[33] The Government firmly denounced the rebellions and labelled the requests as a reminder of the Social Revolutionaries, a political party that was popular among Soviets before Lenin, but refused to cooperate with the Bolshevik Army. The Government then responded with an armed suppression of these revolts and suffered 10 thousand casualties before entering the city of Kronstadt.[34] This ended the rebellions fairly quickly, causing many of the rebels to flee to political exile.[35]\\r\\nDuring the Civil War, Nestor Makhno led a Ukrainian anarchist movement, the Black Army allied to the Bolsheviks thrice, one of the powers ending the alliance each time. However, a Bolshevik force under Mikhail Frunze destroyed the Makhnovist movement, when the Makhnovists refused to merge into the Red Army. In addition, the so-called \\"Green Army\\" (peasants defending their property against the opposing forces) played a secondary role in the war, mainly in the Ukraine.\\r\\nThe Bolsheviks executed the tsar and his family on 16 July 1918.[36] In early March, the Provisional Government placed Nicholas and his family under house arrest in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo, 24 kilometres (15?mi) south of Petrograd. In August 1917 the Kerensky government evacuated the Romanovs to Tobolsk in the Urals, to protect them from the rising tide of revolution during the Red Terror. After the Bolsheviks came to power in October 1917, the conditions of their imprisonment grew stricter and talk of putting Nicholas on trial increased. As the counter revolutionary White movement gathered force, leading to full-scale civil war by the summer, the Romanovs were moved during April and May 1918 to Yekaterinburg, a militant Bolshevik stronghold.\\r\\nDuring the early morning of 16 July, Nicholas, Alexandra, their children, their physician, and several servants were taken into the basement and shot. According to Edvard Radzinsky and Dmitrii Volkogonov, the order came directly from Lenin and Sverdlov in Moscow. That the order came from the top has long been believed, although there is a lack of hard evidence. The execution may have been carried out on the initiative of local Bolshevik officials, or it may have been an option pre-approved in Moscow should White troops approach Yekaterinburg. Radzinsky noted that Lenin's bodyguard personally delivered the telegram ordering the execution and that he was ordered to destroy the evidence.[37][38]\\r\\nLeon Trotsky said that the goal of socialism in Russia would not be realized without the success of the world revolution. Indeed, a revolutionary wave caused by the Russian Revolution lasted until 1923. Despite initial hopes for success in the German Revolution of 1918ÿ19, in the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic and others like it, no other Marxist movement at the time succeeded in keeping power in its hands.\\r\\nThis issue is subject to conflicting views on the communist history by various Marxist groups and parties. Joseph Stalin later rejected this idea, stating that socialism was possible in one country.\\r\\nThe confusion regarding Stalin's position on the issue stems from the fact that he, after Lenin's death in 1924, successfully used Lenin's argument?ÿ the argument that socialism's success needs the workers of other countries in order to happen?ÿ to defeat his competitors within the party by accusing them of betraying Lenin and, therefore, the ideals of the October Revolution.\\r\\nFew events in historical research have been as conditioned by political influences as the October Revolution. The historiography of the Revolution generally divides into three camps: the Soviet-Marxist view, the Western-Totalitarian view, and the Revisionist view.[39] Since the fall of Communism in Russia in 1991, the Western-Totalitarian view has again become dominant and the Soviet-Marxist view has practically vanished.[40]\\r\\nLenin's biographer Robert Service, says he, \\"laid the foundations of dictatorship and lawlessness. Lenin had consolidated the principle of state penetration of the whole society, its economy and its culture. Lenin had practised terror and advocated revolutionary amoralism.\\"[41]\\r\\nDates are correct for the Julian calendar, which was used in Russia until 1918. It was twelve days behind the Gregorian calendar during the 19th century and thirteen days behind it during the 20th century.\\r\\nGeorge Orwell's classic novella Animal Farm is an allegory of the Russian Revolution and its aftermath. It describes the dictator Stalin as a big Berkshire boar named, \\"Napoleon.\\" Trotsky is represented by a pig called Snowball who is a brilliant talker and makes magnificent speeches.

Founded on March 31, 1782, it was the ninth Spanish mission established in California and the last to be established by Father Junpero Serra. The mission was named after Saint Bonaventure, a 13th century Franciscan saint and Doctor of the Church. The mission is  located in the historic downtown of Ventura.\\r\\n\\r\\nMission San Buenaventura was planned to be founded in 1770, but the founding was delayed because of the low availability of the military escorts needed to establish the mission.  In 1793, the first church burned down. Today, only a small section of the entire mission  complex still stands; the cemetery to the left of the church is covered by a school. It took the neophytes 16 years to build the new church, which still functions as a parish church of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe founding of the San Buenaventura Mission traces to the decision on Palm Sunday, March 30, 1749 by the Franciscan priest Junipero Serra to journey to the New World as a missionary to the native peoples.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThirty-three years and one day later he raised the Cross at \\"la playa de la canal de Santa Barbara\\" (the beach of the Santa Barbara Channel) on Easter Morning, March 31, 1782. Assisted by Pedro Benito Cambon, he celebrated a High Mass, preached on the Resurrection, and dedicated a Mission to San Buenaventura (St. Bonaventure). It had been planned as the third in the chain[citation needed] of twenty-one Missions founded by Serra but was destined to be the ninth and last founded during his lifetime, and one of six he personally dedicated.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the direction of Cambon, whom Serra left in charge of the new Mission, a system of aqueducts were built by the Chumash between 1805ÿ1815 to meet the needs of the Mission population and consisted of both ditches and elevated stone masonry. The watercourse ran from a point on the Ventura River about ? mile north of the remaining ruins and carried the water to holding tanks behind the San Buenaventura Mission, a total of about 7 miles (11?km). With plentiful water the Mission was able to maintain flourishing orchards and gardens, which were described by English navigator George Vancouver as the finest he had seen. The water distribution system was damaged by floods and abandoned in 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Missions first church building was destroyed by fire. The construction of a second church was abandoned because \\"the door gave way.\\" In 1792 work was in progress on the present church and the small utility buildings which (with the church) formed a quadrangle enclosing a plaza. Although half finished in 1795, the church was not completed until 1809. Dedication was held September 9 of that year and the first liturgical services took place September 10. At about that time the San Miguel Chapel (present corner of Thompson Boulevard and Palm Street) and the Santa Gertrudis Chapel (Highway 33 near Foster Park) were completed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA series of earthquakes and an accompanying seismic sea wave in 1812 forced the priests and Indian neophytes to seek temporary shelter a few miles inland. Six years later the priests and their flock had to remove sacred objects from the church and flee into the hills to elude a pirate who was pillaging the Missions but fortunately was headed off after a \\"bargaining session\\" at El Refugio in Santa Barbara.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mexican government in 1834 issued a secularization decree divesting the priests of administrative control over the Missions. In 1845 San Buenaventura Mission was rented to Don Jose Arnaz and Narciso Botello and was later illegally sold to Arnaz.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the mission did not fully escape the impact that the MexicanÿAmerican War of 1846ÿ1847 had on California. On January 5, 1847, while on its way from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles, the 428 men strong California Battalion, under the command of U.S. Army Major John C. Fremont, managed to disperse an armed force of up to 70 enemy Californios near the mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter California became a state of the Union, Bishop Joseph Sadoc Alemany petitioned the United States Government to return that part of the Mission holdings comprising the church, clergy residence, cemetery, orchard, and vineyard to the Catholic Church. The request was granted in the form of a Proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln on May 23, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of severe damage in the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake, the Missions tile roof was replaced by a shingle roof. In 1893, Cyprian Rubio \\"modernized\\" the interior of the church, painting over the original artwork; when he finished, little of the old church was untouched. The windows were lengthened, the beamed ceiling and tile floor were covered, and the remnants of the quadrangle were razed. The west sacristy was removed to provide room for a school, which was not actually built until 1921. During the pastorate of Patrick Grogan the roof of the church was once again tiled, the convent and present rectory were built, and a new fountain was placed in the garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe education of children at San Buenaventura Mission has flourished intermittently since 1829 (during Mexican rule) and continuously since 1922. Originally a four-classroom structure, Holy Cross School served its students and the parish admirably since its 1922 dedication. In 1925 it was expanded to accommodate growth and in 1949 a subsequent renovation brought it out to Main Street (El Camino Real) with no space left for further expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a major restoration under the supervision of Aubrey J. O'Reilly in 1956ÿ1957 the windows were reconstructed to their original size, and the ceiling and floor were uncovered. A long-time parishioner commissioned the casting of a bell with an automatic angelus device and donated it to the Mission; it hangs in the belltower above the four ancient hand-operated bells.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second half of the twentieth century brought more growth, as well as wear-and-tear and obsolescence, and the school's problems far exceed spatial deficiency. In response to this situation, the San Buenaventura Mission parish, under the leadership of Monsignor Patrick J. O'Brien, formed a Planning and Development Committee comprising parishioners, faculty, parish staff, and parents, and in June 1994 hired the downtown firm of MainStreet Architects and Planners to prepare a conceptual master site plan for the Mission properties, incorporating the design of a new school and an adjoining Multi-Purpose Building which would serve both school and parish. This plan also necessitated the deconstruction of the Convent and the two remaining Holy Cross Sisters moved into the larger St. Catherine by the Sea convent, a short distance from the Mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire roof of the church was removed and replaced in 1976. In December of that year the church was solemnly consecrated by Timothy Cardinal Manning. In 1982 the Mission marked its bicentennial anniversary. A new three story school building, with pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, and grades 1ÿ8 located at the base of the hill behind the Mission was dedicated in January 2001. The school also houses  the Serra Chapel for Eucharistic Adoration, adult classrooms, a parish/school kitchen, and a large assembly hall used as a school auditorium and for large parish gatherings and one Sunday Mass. The assembly room was named after Monsignor Patrick O'Brien who was the pastor of the church for 25 years until his sudden death in 2005. The Mission celebrated its 225th Anniversary with a year-long series of events and activities during 2006ÿ07.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday all that remains of the original Mission is the church and its garden. A small museum sits at the Mission with displays of Chumash Indian artifacts and mission-era items. Located in the historic downtown of Ventura, very few California missions had the center of business and commerce remain at the location where the mission was established like Mission San Buenaventura. The Church remains an active Catholic Parish serving approximately 2000 families and services are still held in the parish church. The current Pastor is Tom Elewaut, who has served since 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome animals at San Buenaventura were cattle, horses, sheep, donkeys and goats. The cattle were very important because they provided food, oil and hides. In the year of 1818, 35,274 cattle wandered over the mission lands. A little time after January 7, 1831, the animal population decreased to a low of 4,000 cattle, 3,000 sheep, 300 horses and 60 mules. In July 1839, Inspector-General E.P. Hartnell found 2,208 cattle, 1,670 sheep, 799 horses, 35 mules and 65 goats. The soil around Mission San Buenaventura was very good so the mission could grow many crops. San Buenaventura grew apples, grapes, bananas, pears, plums, pomegranates, figs, oranges, coconuts, beans, grain, corn and barley. In the year of 1818, 12,483 bushels of grain were harvested. Shortly after January 7, 1831, harvests had been reduced to 1,750 bushels of wheat, 2,000 bushels of barley, 500 bushels of corn, and 400 bushels of beans. In July 1839, Inspector-General William E.P. Hartnell found 322 fanegas of wheat, 182 fanegas of corn and 35 fanegas of peas.\\r\\n\\r\\nBells were vitally important to daily life at Mission San Buenaventura, which had five bells. The bells were borrowed from Mission Santa Barbara because there were no bells at the time. They were never returned. The bell facing north is labeled S. San Francisco 1781. The bell facing east has the inscription: San Pedro Alcantra 1781. A small swinging bell hangs in the southern arch with the lettering: Ave Maria S. Joseph. The only bell used daily at San Buenaventura is large and crown topped with a cross on its side. Inscribed on the bell is Ave Maria Pruysyma D Sapoyan Ano D 1825, which means \\"Hail Mary Most Pure. Mary of Zapopan Year of 1825.\\" This bell was originally cast for the church of Zapopan but was later sent to Mission San Buenaventura. Another bell, which was once the gift of the Spanish Viceroy, is inscribed Marquez de Croix Mexico November 12, 1770. It is currently owned by Senora Isabel del Valle Cram.

It was designed to limit radioactive contamination of the environment following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, by encasing the most dangerous area and protecting it from climate exposure.[1][2] It is located within a large restricted area known as the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The original Russian name is \\"Obyekt Ukrytiye\\" (ץ쿹 \\"Тҿ\\"),[3] which means \\"sheltering\\" or \\"covering\\", as opposed to sarcophagus.[2] The sarcophagus locked in 200 tons of radioactive corium, 30 tons of highly contaminated dust and 16 tons of uranium and plutonium.[1]\\r\\nIn 1996, it was deemed impossible to repair the inside of the sarcophagus as radiation levels were estimated to be as high as 10,000 r?ntgens per hour (normal background radiation in cities is usually around 20ÿ50 micror?ntgens per hour, and a lethal dose is 500 r?ntgens over 5 hours).[4] A decision to replace the sarcophagus with the New Safe Confinement was taken, and a project to reconstruct the enclosure has since been completed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design of the sarcophagus started on May 20, 1986, 24 days after the disaster. Subsequent construction lasted for 206 days, from June to late November of the same year.[2] The first task before construction started was to build a cooling slab under the reactor to prevent the hot nuclear fuel from burning a hole in the base. Coal miners were called up to dig the necessary tunnel below the reactor and by June 24, 1986 four hundred coal miners had dug the 168-metre (551?ft) long tunnel.[5] When the building became overly radioactive, it became impossible to directly screw down the nuts and bolts or apply any direct welding to the sarcophagus, so this work was done by robots.[1] The seams of the sarcophagus, however, were not properly sealed.\\r\\nThe entire construction process consisted of eight stages: clearing and concreting of territory around reactor unit 4, erection of initial reinforced concrete protective walls around the perimeter, construction of separation walls between units 3 and 4, cascade wall construction, covering of the turbine hall, mounting of a high-rise buttress wall, erection of supports and installation of a reactor compartment covering and finally the installation of a ventilation system.\\r\\nMore than 7005400000000000000?400000?m3 of concrete and 7,300 tonnes of metal framework were used during the erection of the sarcophagus.[2] The building ultimately enclosed 7005740000000000000?740000?m3 of heavily contaminated debris inside,[1] together with contaminated soil.[5] On October 11, 1986 the Soviet Governmental Commission accepted a report entitled \\"Conclusion on Reliability and Durability of a Covering Constructions and Radiation Safety of Chernobyl NPP Unit 4 Reactor Compartment\\".[6][verification needed] The sarcophagus has over 60 bore holes to allow observation of the interior of the core.[7] In many places the structure was designed to have ventilation shafts to allow some convection inside.[7] Filtration systems have been put in place so that no radioactive material will escape through these holes.[7]\\r\\nThe present shelter is constructed on top of the ruins of the reactor building. The two \\"Mammoth Beams\\" that support the roof of the shelter rest partly on the structurally unsound west wall of the reactor building that was damaged by the accident.[8] The western end of the shelter roof is supported by a wall at a point designated axis 50. This wall is reinforced concrete and was cracked by the accident.\\r\\nThe DSSS is a yellow steel object that has been placed next to the wrecked reactor; it is 63 meters (207?ft) tall and has a series of cantilevers that extend through the western buttress wall, and is intended to stabilize the sarcophagus.[9] This was done because if the wall of the reactor building or the roof of the shelter were to collapse, then large amounts of radioactive dust and particles would be released directly into the atmosphere, resulting in a large new release of radioactivity into the environment. In December 2006 the \\"Designed Stabilisation Steel Structure\\" (DSSS) was extended until 50% of the roof load (about 400 tons) was transferred from the axis 50 wall to the DSSS.[citation needed]\\r\\nA further threat to the shelter is the concrete slab that formed the \\"Upper Biological Shield\\" (UBS), situated above the reactor prior to the accident.[citation needed] This concrete slab was thrown upwards by the explosion in the reactor core and now rests at approximately 15 from vertical. The position of the upper bioshield is considered inherently unsafe, as only debris supports it in its nearly upright position. A collapse of the bioshield would further exacerbate the dust conditions in the shelter, possibly spreading some quantity of radioactive materials out of the shelter, and could damage the shelter itself. The UBS is a circle 15 meters in diameter, weighing 1000 tons and consisting of 2000 cubes, each located above a fuel channel. The shield, called Pyatachok (meaning pig's nose) before the disaster, was afterwards named Component \\"E\\" and nicknamed \\"Elena\\"; the twisted fuel bundles still attached to it are called \\"Elena's hair.\\"[10][11][12]\\r\\nOn December 22, 1988, Soviet scientists announced that the sarcophagus would only last 20ÿ30 years before requiring restorative maintenance work. In 1998, with the help of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a conservation programme was completed which included securing the roof beams from collapsing. Nonetheless, the rain-induced corrosion of supporting beams still threatens the sarcophagus' integrity.[5] It was revealed that the water is leaking through the sarcophagus via holes in its roof, becoming radioactively contaminated, and then seeping through the reactor's floor into the soil.[5]\\r\\nA new containment device will allow the sarcophagus to be dismantled and radioactive material to be removed.[13] The New Safe Confinement was expected to replace the existing sarcophagus in 2015. However, delays and a ?100 million funding gap caused a yearlong delay, before being moved into place in November 2016.","input":"What was the original purpose of building chernobyl?"},{"output":"24ÿ28.4 kilolight-years","context":"The Galactic Center is the rotational center of the Milky Way.

He found that near the star Alnasl (Gamma Sagittarii) there is a one-degree-wide void in the interstellar dust lanes, which provides a relatively clear view of the swarms of stars around the nucleus of our Milky Way Galaxy.[3] This gap has been known as Baade's Window ever since.[4]\\r\\nAt Dover Heights in Sydney, Australia a team of radio astronomers from the Division of Radiophysics at the CSIRO, led by Joseph Lade Pawsey, used 'sea interferometry' to discover some of the first interstellar and intergalactic radio sources, including Taurus A, Virgo A and Centaurus A. By 1954 they had built an 80 feet (24.4 meters) fixed dish antenna and used it to make a detailed study of an extended, extremely powerful belt of radio emission that was detected in Sagittarius. They named an intense point-source near the center of this belt Sagittarius A, and realised that it was located at the very center of our Galaxy, despite being some 32 degrees south-west of the conjectured galactic center of the time.[5]\\r\\nIn 1958 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) decided to adopt the position of Sagittarius A as the true zero co-ordinate point for the system of galactic latitude and longitude.[6] In the equatorial coordinate system the location is: RA 17h?45m?40.04s, Dec ?29?00?28.1 (J2000 epoch).\\r\\nThe exact distance between the Solar System and the Galactic Center is not certain,[7] although estimates since 2000 have remained within the range 24ÿ28.4 kilolight-years (7.4ÿ8.7 kiloparsecs).[8] The latest estimates from geometric-based methods and standard candles yield the following distances to the Galactic Center:\\r\\nAn accurate determination of the distance to the Galactic Center as established from variable stars (e.g. RR Lyrae variables) or standard candles (e.g. red-clump stars) is hindered by countless effects, which include: an ambiguous reddening law; a bias for smaller values of the distance to the Galactic Center because of a preferential sampling of stars toward the near side of the Galactic bulge owing to interstellar extinction; and an uncertainty in characterizing how a mean distance to a group of variable stars found in the direction of the Galactic bulge relates to the distance to the Galactic Center.[17][18]\\r\\nThe nature of the Milky Way's bar, which extends across the Galactic Center, is also actively debated, with estimates for its half-length and orientation spanning between 1ÿ5 kpc (short or a long bar) and 10ÿ50.[16][17][19] Certain authors advocate that the Milky Way features two distinct bars, one nestled within the other.[20] The bar is delineated by red-clump stars (see also red giant); however, RR Lyr variables do not trace a prominent Galactic bar.[17][21][22] The bar may be surrounded by a ring called the \\"5-kpc ring\\" that contains a large fraction of the molecular hydrogen present in the Milky Way, as well as most of the Milky Way's star formation activity. Viewed from the Andromeda Galaxy, it would be the brightest feature of the Milky Way.[23]\\r\\nThe complex astronomical radio source Sagittarius A appears to be located almost exactly at the Galactic Center (approx. 18 hrs, ?29 deg), and contains an intense compact radio source, Sagittarius A*, which coincides with a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Accretion of gas onto the black hole, probably involving a disk around it, would release energy to power the radio source, itself much larger than the black hole. The latter is too small to see with present instruments.\\r\\nA study in 2008 which linked radio telescopes in Hawaii, Arizona and California (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) measured the diameter of Sagittarius A* to be 44 million kilometers (0.3 AU).[25][26] For comparison, the radius of Earth's orbit around the Sun is about 150 million kilometers (1.0 AU), whereas the distance of Mercury from the Sun at closest approach (perihelion) is 46 million kilometers (0.3 AU). Thus the diameter of the radio source is slightly less than the distance from Mercury to the Sun.\\r\\nScientists at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany using Chilean telescopes have confirmed the existence of a supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center, on the order of 4.3 million solar masses.[15]\\r\\nOn 5 January 2015, NASA reported observing an X-ray flare 400 times brighter than usual, a record-breaker, from Sagittarius A*. The unusual event may have been caused by the breaking apart of an asteroid falling into the black hole or by the entanglement of magnetic field lines within gas flowing into Sagittarius A*, according to astronomers.[27]\\r\\nThe central cubic parsec around Sagittarius A* contains around 10 million stars.[28] Although most of them are old red giant stars, the Galactic Center is also rich in massive stars. More than 100 OB and WolfÿRayet stars have been identified there so far.[29] They seem to have all been formed in a single star formation event a few million years ago. The existence of these relatively young stars was a surprise to experts, who expected the tidal forces from the central black hole to prevent their formation. This paradox of youth is even stronger for stars that are on very tight orbits around Sagittarius A*, such as S2 and S0-102. The scenarios invoked to explain this formation involve either star formation in a massive star cluster offset from the Galactic Center that would have migrated to its current location once formed, or star formation within a massive, compact gas accretion disk around the central black-hole. Most of these 100 young, massive stars seem to be concentrated within one or two disks, rather than randomly distributed within the central parsec.[30][31] This observation however does not allow definite conclusions to be drawn at this point.\\r\\nStar formation does not seem to be occurring currently at the Galactic Center, although the Circumnuclear Disk of molecular gas that orbits the Galactic Center at two parsecs seems a fairly favorable site for star formation. Work presented in 2002 by Antony Stark and Chris Martin mapping the gas density in a 400-light-year region around the Galactic Center has revealed an accumulating ring with a mass several million times that of the Sun and near the critical density for star formation. They predict that in approximately 200 million years there will be an episode of starburst in the Galactic Center, with many stars forming rapidly and undergoing supernovae at a hundred times the current rate. This starburst may also be accompanied by the formation of galactic jets as matter falls into the central black hole. It is thought that the Milky Way undergoes a starburst of this sort every 500 million years.\\r\\nIn addition to the paradox of youth, there is also a \\"conundrum of old age\\" associated with the distribution of the old stars at the Galactic Center. Theoretical models had predicted that the old starswhich far outnumber young starsshould have a steeply-rising density near the black hole, a so-called BahcallÿWolf cusp. Instead, it was discovered in 2009 that the density of the old stars peaks at a distance of roughly 0.5 parsec from Sgr A*, then falls inward: instead of a dense cluster, there is a \\"hole\\", or core, around the black hole.[32] Several suggestions have been put forward to explain this puzzling observation, but none is completely satisfactory.[33][34] For instance, although the black hole would eat stars near it, creating a region of low density, this region would be much smaller than a parsec. Because the observed stars are a fraction of the total number, it is theoretically possible that the overall stellar distribution is different than what is observed, although no plausible models of this sort have yet been proposed.\\r\\nWhite Dwarfs in Milky Way's Central Hub[35]\\r\\nThe center of the Milky Way - image taken by ISAAC, the VLT's near- and mid-infrared spectrometer and camera\\r\\nInfrared image from Spitzer Space Telescope\\r\\nA view of the night sky near Sagittarius, enhanced to show better contrast and detail in the dust lanes.

He was created by Michael S. Chernuchin and portrayed by Sam Waterston from 1994 until the end of the series in 2010. He is the second-longest tenured character on the show (16 seasons), after Lt. Anita Van Buren (17 seasons; portrayed by S. Epatha Merkerson). He appeared in 368 episodes of Law & Order, four episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, two episodes of Law & Order: Trial by Jury, two episodes of Homicide: Life on the Street, and the made-for-TV movie Exiled.\\r\\nWaterston's performance as McCoy on the New York-based series was so popular that it resulted in him being declared a \\"Living Landmark\\" by the New York Landmarks Conservancy, along with fellow longtime series cast member Jerry Orbach (who portrayed the popular police detective Lennie Briscoe for 12 years).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJack McCoy brings 24 years of experience with him as he is appointed executive assistant district attorney by Adam Schiff (Steven Hill) in the season five premiere episode \\"Second Opinion\\". He quickly establishes himself as a more unconventional, ruthless litigator than his predecessor, Ben Stone (Michael Moriarty). He often bendsand sometimes breakstrial rules to get convictions, finds tenuous rationales for charging defendants with crimes when the original charges fail to stick, and charges innocent people to frighten them into testifying against others. McCoy is found in contempt of court 80 times for such behavior, and his tactics occasionally incur negative publicity for the DA's office. His underlying motivation, however, is not, he maintains, corruption, but a sincere desire to see justice done. To that end, McCoy has gone after defendants accused of perverting the justice system to arrange wrongful convictions with just as much determination as his more mundane cases. Such aggressive actions in the courts have earned him the nickname \\"Hang 'em High McCoy\\".[2] He has subsequently developed a reputation with both colleagues and rival attorneys, once being referred to as \\"the top of the legal food chain\\" by a rival attorney during a trial.[3]\\r\\nFollowing the 17th season (2006ÿ2007), Jack McCoy was appointed interim district attorney, taking over from Arthur Branch (Fred Thompson). McCoy's appearance on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit on the November 13, 2007, episode \\"Blinded\\", marked his first appearance in the Law & Order universe as district attorney. The replacement for his former position is Michael Cutter (Linus Roache), a prosecutor with a penchant for recklessness not unlike McCoy's own in his younger days. This occasionally presents political difficulties for the new district attorney. More than once, McCoy berates Cutter for reckless conduct, in the same manner as he was berated by district attorneys when he was executive assistant district attorney.\\r\\nIn the season 19 episode \\"Lucky Stiff\\", McCoy begins his election campaign for New York County District Attorney after serving the last season and a half as interim DA. In the season-19 episode \\"Promote This\\", in 1991 his wife Ellen (whom he was divorcing) is revealed to have unknowingly employed an undocumented immigrant as a nanny. This causes McCoy political havoc during a murder case where the motive was racism against illegal immigrants of Hispanic descent. In the episode \\"Skate or Die\\", the place where his final campaign fundraiser would be held is discovered by the organizers to be owned by a man who served a 20-year prison sentence for racketeering. Eventually, the final campaign fundraiser is held at a Chinese seafood restaurant with a kosher section.\\r\\nMcCoy was hand-picked for the interim DA position by Governor Donald Shalvoy (Tom Everett Scott), and the two initially have a friendly, productive working relationship. By the end of the 18th season, however, McCoy discovers that Shalvoy is involved in a prostitution scandal that is tied to a murder case he is prosecuting. Angered and disappointed, McCoy orders Cutter to start investigating Shalvoy, who retaliates by lending his support to McCoy's opponent in the election. In the last episode of season 19, \\"The Drowned and the Saved\\", Cutter uncovers evidence that Shalvoy tried to buy a Senate seat for his wife, and threatens him with public disgrace unless he resigns. McCoy's opponent suddenly has no patron, giving McCoy good prospects for victory.[4] In the opening episode of season 20, McCoy was revealed to have won the election; he serves as DA for the remainder of this final season of Law & Order.\\r\\nWhile he is a brilliant legal mind, McCoy has more than a few personal demons. He was abused by his father, an Irish Chicago policeman who had also beat Jack's mother, and who eventually died of cancer.[5] McCoy says that his determination and unyielding work ethic are a byproduct of having been harshly punished by his father for losing at anything.[5] He also revealed that his father was a racist who once hit him for dating a Polish girl.[6] McCoy disliked his father, calling him a \\"son-of-a-bitch\\"; however, he admits he could have easily become like him.[6]\\r\\nWhile not a nationalist, he cares enough about his heritage to be offended by a lawyer's insinuation that two murder suspects committed the crime because of their \\"Irish temper\\".[7]\\r\\nMcCoy has been divorced twice (one ex-wife having been a former assistant) and has an adult daughter, Rebecca, with Ellen. One of his ex-wives left him because he worked too many late nights.[8] A gossip columnist writes that McCoy has not seen or spoken to his daughter since 1997, and McCoy receives an envelope containing pictures of his daughter.[9] He does not open the envelope; rather, he places it in his bottom left desk drawer, next to a bottle of Jim Beam. In \\"Fallout\\", the last scene shows McCoy meeting his daughter at a restaurant. During a conversation with (fictional) New York Governor Donald Shalvoy, he mentions Rebecca has taken a job in San Diego, and that she drove up to Los Angeles to meet him there for dinner while he was attending a conference on official business;[10] the governor uses this to try to smear McCoy, wrongly implying that he used public funds to visit Rebecca. In the season-20 episode \\"Dignity\\", McCoy mentions to EADA Michael Cutter (Roache) and ADA Connie Rubirosa (Alana de la Garza) that his daughter is either pregnant or a new mother, thus making him soon to be or already a grandfather. He also has a nephew, which indicates that he has at least one sibling.[11] By 2008, his nephew had a young daughter.[12]\\r\\nMcCoy has a reputation for having romantic affairs with his ADAs. Claire Kincaid (Jill Hennessy) mentions this when they first meet; he tells her he has had affairs with only three of his ADAs, but by the end of the episode, she realizes that he has only had three female ADAs before her.[13] In the episode \\"Scoundrels\\", McCoy reveals that Sally Bell, a recurring defense attorney played by Edie Falco, had been one of those ADAs.[13] He at one point was revealed to have had a romantic relationship with his frequent courtroom adversary, defense attorney Vanessa Galiano (Roma Maffia).[14] Kincaid initially makes it clear that she is not interested in a romantic relationship, and McCoy agrees to her stipulation.[13] However, throughout the two seasons in which the two characters appear together, they are implied to be having an affair, with the relationship eventually confirmed in the season-9 episode \\"Sideshow\\", long after the Kincaid character had exited the show. Kincaid is killed in a car accident,[5] a source of ongoing pain for McCoy. Defense attorneys have used his sexual history against him.[15] Since Kincaid's death, McCoy has kept his relationships with assistants professional, albeit friendly.\\r\\nMcCoy's affairs with his ADAs have often had explosive consequences. For instance, his former ADA Diana Hawthorne (Laila Robins), with whom he had a sexual relationship, was found to have suppressed evidence so they could win a case, resulting in an innocent man going to prison. During her trial for intentionally engineering the wrongful convictions, Hawthorne claims that the convictions earned McCoy a promotion he was seeking. Ironically, in the same trial, during which McCoy is forced to admit he was having an affair with Hawthorne, he is being represented by Kincaid, with whom he is presently having an affair.[2]\\r\\nIn \\"House Counsel\\", McCoy tries to prosecute a mobster for bribing and murdering a juror. The man's lawyer, Paul Kopell (Ron Leibman), is one of McCoy's oldest friends, with whom he had a competitive relationship for years, and he proves to be equally aggressive in his approach to his work. As Kopell repeatedly stymies McCoy's prosecutorial efforts, McCoy takes the position that Kopell is not acting as an independent attorney, but as a participant in organized crime, and eventually prosecutes Kopell for conspiracy in the juror's murder. He tells Kopell's wife that the prosecution is not personal, but she angrily replies that McCoy simply wants the final victory over a rival. By the end of the episode, though he has won the case, McCoy is so troubled that he does not even want to share an elevator with Kincaid.[16]\\r\\nWhile McCoy was not exactly a part of the 1960s counterculture, he did protest against the policies of the Richard Nixon administration, particularly the Vietnam War. In 1972, he published an article in the New York University Law Review in defense of Catholic priests who had been opposed to the conflict.[17] He does retain some of the wild streak from his youth; he is a fan of The Clash[18] and he rides a Yamaha motorcycle.[19] He is opposed to the Iraq War.[20]\\r\\nUnlike his predecessor Ben Stone (Michael Moriarty), McCoy embraces the option of the death penalty, claiming it is a suitable punishment for particularly heinous crimes and a useful threat in plea bargaining. This often leads to heated arguments with his more liberal colleagues. In \\"Savages\\", when the death penalty has just been restored in New York following the election of Governor George Pataki, Kincaid asks McCoy about the probability of executing an innocent individual. McCoy responds that, with the lengthy prosecution process and opportunities for the defendant to appeal the verdict, the probability of wrongful execution is unlikely. Kincaid asks McCoy if he is able to accept the probability of \\"unlikely\\"; his hesitation indicates that he has never considered the possibility. In later seasons, his view towards the death penalty has apparently changed: in season 18's \\"Executioner\\", he is deeply troubled hearing of a gruesomely botched execution in South Carolina, and in season 20's \\"Four Cops Shot\\", he resists efforts by a U.S. attorney to prosecute a suspect in the murder of a police officer under a federal death penalty statute.\\r\\nHe has shown mercy on occasion, such as the 1997 episode \\"Burned\\" in which he prosecutes a boy with bipolar disorder for murdering his sister. The boy's grandfather (Robert Vaughn), a wealthy CEO (and good friend of Schiff's) who also proved to suffer from the disorder, had attempted to get his grandson to plead guilty and go to jail rather than plead insanity and be committed to a mental institution, fearing that a public revelation of the boy's illness would provide enough evidence to reveal his own illness and affect his reputation. McCoy leads the effort to prevent an unjust punishment for the boy.[21] Similarly, in season seven's \\"Deadbeat\\", he declines to prosecute a woman who is the sole caregiver for a boy dying of cancer, although he implies that he may do so once the son has died.[22]\\r\\nMcCoy was raised Catholic, but does not appear to be in practice, and has not been for some time; he describes himself as a \\"lapsed Catholic\\".[23] McCoy was educated by the Jesuits.[24] On several occasions, religion has been the subject of various cases. In the episode \\"Thrill\\", in which two teenaged boys are accused of killing a man just for fun, McCoy finds his case particularly complicated when one of the suspects confesses the crime to his uncle, a priest. When the confession tape is labeled privileged, McCoy ignores the bishop's request to preserve the sacrament of reconciliation and instead tries to use the tape as evidence. When Detective Rey Curtis (Benjamin Bratt) tries to dissuade McCoy from doing so, reminding him that he is a Catholic, McCoy responds, \\"Not when I'm at work.\\"[25]\\r\\nWhen a man is accused of killing a drug dealer who killed the man's son, a priest confesses to the crime. Though McCoy personally believes that the priest is covering for the man, he prosecutes the priest, instead. At the end of the episode, McCoy says that he lost his faith after the death of a childhood friend.[26]\\r\\nMcCoy's unconventional and sometimes ruthless professional conduct has put his job in jeopardy more than once throughout the series. Some of the more serious occurrences are:\\r\\nMcCoy has appeared in four episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit; however, he is often referred to in the series, and his actions affect the ADAs working with the Special Victims Unit.\\r\\nEntertainment Weekly television critic Ken Tucker has praised Law & Order's creator Dick Wolf for putting McCoy at the center of \\"some of the best episodes of the immortal series' 19th season.\\"[28] Tucker elaborates how the character, riding \\"herd over a couple of stubborn young bucks  assistant DAs Mike Cutter (Linus Roache) and Connie Rubirosa (Alana de la Garza)  McCoy argues, bellows orders, and croaks with outrage when his charges disobey his legal advice.\\"[28]","input":"What season did mccoy join law and order?"},{"output":"Global Positioning System","context":"","input":"What is the full form of g p s?"},{"output":"a government-backed Life insurance scheme in India","context":"Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana is a government-backed Life insurance scheme in India.

A small toy is included with the food, both of which are usually contained in a red box with a yellow smiley face and the McDonald's logo. The packaging and toy are frequently part of a marketing tie-in to an existing television show, film, or toy brand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Happy Meal contains a main item (typically a hamburger, cheeseburger, or small serving of Chicken McNuggets), a side item (french fries, apple slices, a Go-Gurt tube, or a salad in some areas), and a drink (milk, juice, or a soft drink). The choice of items changes from country to country, and may depend on the size of the restaurant.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some countries, the choices have been expanded to include items such as a grilled cheese sandwich (known as a \\"Fry Kid\\"), or more healthy options such as apple slices, a mini snack wrap, salads, or pasta, as one or more of the options.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mid-1970s, Yolanda Fernndez de Cofi?o began working with her husband operating McDonald's restaurants in Guatemala. She created what she called the \\"Menu Ronald\\" (Ronald menu), which offered a hamburger, small fries and a small sundae to help mothers feed their children more effectively while at McDonald's restaurants.[2][3]  The concept was eventually brought to the attention of McDonald's management in Chicago. The company gave the development of the product to Bob Bernstein, who then came up with the Happy Meal.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1977, the McDonald's restaurant owner clients who regularly met with Bernstein were looking for ways to create a better experience for families with kids. Bernstein reasoned that if kids could get a packaged meal all their own instead of just picking at their parent's food, everybody would be happier. He had often noticed his young son at the breakfast table poring over the various items on cereal boxes and thought, \\"Why not do that for McDonald's? The package is the key!\\" He then called in his creative team and had them mock up some paperboard boxes fashioned to resemble lunch pails with the McDonald's Golden Arches for handles. They called in nationally known children's illustrators and offered them the blank slate of filling the box's sides and tops with their own colorful ideas from art to jokes to games to comic strips to stories to fantasy: whatever they thought might appeal to kids, at least 8 items per box. Inside the box would be a burger, small fries, packet of cookies and a surprise gift. A small drink would accompany these items. Bernstein named it The Happy Meal and it was successfully introduced with television and radio spots and in-store posters in the Kansas City market in October 1977. Other markets followed and the national roll-out happened in 1979.\\r\\n\\r\\nBernstein received Trademark #1136758 (Serial #73148046)[5] for his idea in 1977 which he assigned to his valued client, McDonald's Corporation, on June 10, 1980. In 1987 at the annual McDonald's marketing meeting, he was recognized for his accomplishment with a full-size bronze replica of the Happy Meal box with the following inscription:\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's Happy Meal 10th Anniversary 1977-1987\\r\\nTo Robert A.

The first such promotion was the Star Trek Meal, to promote Star Trek: The Motion Picture in December 1979.[6] The packaging used for the Star Trek Meal consisted of various images and games related to the film, as well as a comic-strip adaptation of the film. Consumers had to buy numerous meals in order to complete the set. In 1982, McDonald's recalled Happy Meal toys because they could have been dangerous to children under 3 years of age.[7] In 1992, McDonald's withdrew their range of Happy Meal toys for the film Batman Returns, after complaints from parents that the film was unsuitable for children.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2011, McDonald's announced plans to make Happy Meals healthier, including the addition of apples. The redesigned meals will contain a smaller portion (1.1 ounces) of fries, along with the apples.  On February 4, 2013, McDonald's announced that Fish McBites, fried Alaskan pollock, the same fish used in Filet-O-Fish, would be added as an entree, which would run until March, intended to coincide with Lent.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, McDonald's added a mascot to Happy Meals in the United States, known as Happy. Happy was originated from France in 2009. Reactions were mixed, with criticism that the mascot's design was too frightening.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Happy Meal did not introduce the practice of providing small toys to children. When the Happy Meal started in 1979, the toys back then were a McDoodle stencil, a McWrist wallet, an ID bracelet, a puzzle lock, a spinning top, or a McDonaldland character-shaped eraser. In Canada, the promotion prior to the Happy Meal was called the \\"Treat of the Week\\", where a different toy was available free on request each week.[11] This promotion continued after the Happy Meal was introduced in 1979. Happy Meal toys have become increasingly elaborate in recent years. While initially they were little more than a cheap plastic trinket such as a Frisbee or ball, they have gradually been replaced with increasingly sophisticated toys, many of which are a tie-in to an existing TV show, film, or toy line.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 2, 2010, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a law requiring that children's meals sold in restaurants must meet certain nutritional standards before they could be sold with toys, to reduce triggering of childhood obesity. The law, urged in part by an increase of childhood obesity in the United States, would allow toys to be included with children's meals that have less than 600 calories and less than 640 milligrams of sodium, contain fruits and vegetables, and include beverages without excessive fat or sugar.

It was a colony of the Kingdom of England from 1636 to 1707, when the Acts of Union were passed, and then a colony of the unified Kingdom of Great Britain until 1776. After the American Revolution, it became the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (commonly known as just Rhode Island).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe land that became the English colony was first home to the Narragansett Indians, which led to the name of the modern town of Narragansett, showing respect to the Narragansett and Nipmuc peoples. European settlement began around 1622 with a trading post at Sowams, now the town of Warren.\\r\\nRoger Williams, a Puritan theologian and linguist, founded Providence Plantations in 1636 on land given to him by Narragansett sachem Canonicus. Williams was exiled under religious persecution from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He and his fellow settlers agreed on an egalitarian constitution providing for majority rule \\"in civil things,\\" with liberty of conscience on spiritual matters. He named the settlement Providence Plantation, believing that God had brought them there. (The term \\"plantation\\" was used in the 17th century as a synonym for \\"settlement\\" or \\"colony.\\")[1] Williams named the islands in the Narragansett Bay after Christian virtues: Patience, Prudence, and Hope Islands.[2]\\r\\nIn 1637, another group of Massachusetts dissenters purchased land from the Indians on Aquidneck Island, which was called Rhode Island at the time, and they established a settlement called Pocasset. The group included William Coddington, John Clarke, and Anne and William Hutchinson, among others. That settlement, however, quickly split into two separate settlements. Samuel Gorton and others remained to establish the settlement of Portsmouth (which formerly was Pocasset) in 1638, while Coddington and Clarke established nearby Newport in 1639. Both settlements were situated on Rhode Island (Aquidneck).\\r\\nThe second plantation settlement on the mainland was Samuel Gortons Shawomet Purchase from the Narragansetts in 1642. As soon as Gorton settled at Shawomet, however, the Massachusetts Bay authorities laid claim to his territory and acted to enforce their claim. After considerable difficulties with the Massachusetts Bay General Court, Gorton traveled to London to enlist the help of Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, head of the Commission for Foreign Plantations. Gorton returned in 1648 with a letter from Rich, ordering Massachusetts to cease molesting him and his people. In gratitude, he changed the name of Shawomet Plantation to Warwick.[3]\\r\\nIn 1651, William Coddington obtained a separate charter from England setting up the Coddington Commission, which made him life governor of the islands of Rhode Island and Conanicut in a federation with Connecticut Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony. Protest, open rebellion, and a further petition to Oliver Cromwell in London led to the reinstatement of the original charter in 1653.[4]\\r\\nFollowing the 1660 restoration of royal rule in England, it was necessary to gain a Royal Charter from King Charles II. Charles was a Catholic sympathizer in staunchly Protestant England, and he approved of the colony's promise of religious freedom. He granted the request with the Royal Charter of 1663, uniting the four settlements together into the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. In the following years, many persecuted groups settled in the colony, notably Quakers and Jews.[5][6] The Rhode Island colony was very progressive for the time, passing laws abolishing witchcraft trials, imprisonment for debt, most capital punishment and, on May 18, 1652, chattel slavery of both blacks and whites.[7][8]\\r\\nRhode Island remained at peace with local Indians, but the relationship was more strained between other New England colonies and certain tribes and sometimes led to bloodshed, despite attempts by the Rhode Island leadership to broker peace.[5][6] During King Philip's War (1675ÿ1676), both sides regularly violated Rhode Island's neutrality. The war's largest battle occurred in Rhode Island, when a force of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Plymouth militia under General Josiah Winslow invaded and destroyed the fortified Narragansett village in the Great Swamp in southern Rhode Island, on December 19, 1675.[9] The Narragansetts also invaded and burned down several of the cities of Rhode Island, including Providence. Roger Williams knew both Metacom (English name Philip) and Canonchet as children. He was aware of the tribe's movements and promptly sent letters informing the Governor of Massachusetts of enemy movements. By his prompt action, Providence Plantations made some efforts at fortifying the town, and Williams even started training recruits for protection. In one of the final actions of the war, troops from Connecticut hunted down and killed \\"King Philip\\", as they called the Narragansett war leader Metacom, on Rhode Island's territory.[5][6]\\r\\nIn the 1680s, Charles II sought to streamline administration of the English colonies and to more closely control their trade. The Navigation Acts passed in the 1660s were widely disliked, since merchants often found themselves trapped and at odds with the rules. However, many colonial governments, Massachusetts principally among them, refused to enforce the acts, and took matters one step further by obstructing the activities of the Crown agents.[10] Charles' successor James II introduced the Dominion of New England in 1686 as a means to accomplish these goals. Under its provisional president Joseph Dudley, the disputed \\"King's Country\\" (present-day Washington County) was brought into the dominion, and the rest of the colony was brought under dominion control by Governor Sir Edmund Andros. The rule of Andros was extremely unpopular, especially in Massachusetts. The 1688 Glorious Revolution deposed James II and brought William III and Mary II to the English throne; Massachusetts authorities conspired in April 1689 to have Andros arrested and sent back to England.[citation needed] With this event, the dominion collapsed and Rhode Island resumed its previous government.[11]\\r\\nThe bedrock of the economy continued to be agriculture ÿ especially dairy farming ÿ and fishing; lumber and shipbuilding also became major industries. Slaves were introduced at this time, although there is no record of any law re-legalizing slave holding. Ironically, the colony later prospered under the slave trade, by distilling rum to sell in Africa as part of a profitable triangular trade in slaves and sugar between Africa, America, and the Caribbean.[12]\\r\\nLeading figures in the colony were involved in the 1776 launch of the American Revolutionary War which delivered American independence from the British Empire, such as former royal governors Stephen Hopkins and Samuel Ward, as well as John Brown, Nicholas Brown, William Ellery, the Reverend James Manning, and the Reverend Ezra Stiles, each of whom had played an influential role in founding Brown University in Providence in 1764 as a sanctuary for religious and intellectual freedom.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn May 4, 1776, Rhode Island became the first of the 13 colonies to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown,[13] and was the fourth to ratify the Articles of Confederation between the newly sovereign states on February 9, 1778.[14] It boycotted the 1787 convention that drew up the United States Constitution,[15] and initially refused to ratify it.[16] It relented after Congress sent a series of constitutional amendments to the states for ratification, the Bill of Rights guaranteeing specific personal freedoms and rights; clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings; and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. On May 29, 1790, Rhode Island became the 13th state and the last of the former colonies to ratify the Constitution.[17]","input":"What was the purpose of rhode island colony?"},{"output":"Thriller","context":"This is a list of the world's best-selling albums of recorded music.

Such rocks are exposed on the Earth's surface in very few places. \\r\\nSome of the oldest surface rock can be found in the Canadian Shield, Australia, Africa and in a few other old regions around the world. The ages of these felsic rocks are generally between 2.5 and 3.8 billion years. The approximate ages have a margin of error of millions of years. In 1999, the oldest known rock on Earth was dated to 4.031 I0.003 billion years, and is part of the Acasta Gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada.[1] Researchers at McGill University found a rock with a very old model age for extraction from the mantle (3.8 to 4.28 billion years ago) in the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt on the coast of Hudson Bay, in northern Quebec;[2] the true age of these samples is still under debate, and they may actually be closer to 3.8 billion years old.[3] Older than these rocks are crystals of the mineral zircon, which can survive the disaggregation of their parent rock and be found and dated in younger rock formations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest material of terrestrial origin that has been dated is a zircon mineral of 4.404 I0.008 Ga enclosed in a metamorphosed sandstone conglomerate in the Jack Hills of the Narryer Gneiss Terrane of Western Australia.[4] The 4.404 I0.008 Ga zircon is a slight outlier, with the oldest consistently-dated zircon falling closer to 4.35 Ga.[5] This zircon is part of a population of zircons within the metamorphosed conglomerate, which is believed to have been deposited about 3.060?Ga, which is the age of the youngest detrital zircon in the rock. Recent developments in atom-probe tomography have led to a further constraint on the age of the oldest continental zircon, with the most recent age quoted as 4.374 I0.006 Ga.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest rock formation is, depending on the latest research, either part of the Isua Greenstone Belt, Narryer Gneiss Terrane, Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt, or the Acasta Gneiss (on the Slave Craton). The difficulty in assigning the title to one particular block of gneiss is that the gneisses are all extremely deformed, and the oldest rock may be represented by only one streak of minerals in a mylonite, representing a layer of sediment or an old dike. This may be difficult to find or map; hence, the oldest dates yet resolved are as much generated by luck in sampling as by understanding the rocks themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is thus premature to claim that any of these rocks, or indeed that of other formations of Hadean gneisses, is the oldest formations or rocks on Earth; doubtless, new analyses will continue to change our conceptions of the structure and nature of these ancient continental fragments.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, the oldest cratons on Earth include the Kaapvaal Craton, the Western Gneiss Terrane of the Yilgarn Craton (~2.9 ÿ >3.2 Ga), the Pilbara Craton (~3.4 Ga), and portions of the Canadian Shield (~2.4 ÿ >3.6 Ga). Parts of the poorly studied Dharwar Craton in India are greater than 3.0 Ga. The oldest dated rocks of the Baltic Shield are 3.5 Ga old.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Acasta Gneiss in the Canadian Shield in the Northwest Territories, Canada is composed of the Archaean igneous and gneissic cores of ancient mountain chains that have been exposed in a glacial peneplain. Analyses of zircons from a felsic orthogneiss with presumed granitic protolith returned an age of 4.031 I0.003 Ga.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 25, 2008, researchers from McGill University, Carnegie Institution for Science and UQAM announced that a rock formation, the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt, exposed on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay in northern Quebec had a SmÿNd model age for extraction from the mantle of 4.28 billion years.[8][9][10][11] However, it is argued that the actual age of formation of this rock, as opposed to the extraction of its magma from the mantle, is likely closer to 3.8 billion years, according to Simon Wilde of the Institute for Geoscience Research in Australia.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe zircons from the Western Australian Jack Hills returned an age of 4.404 billion years, interpreted to be the age of crystallization. These zircons also show another interesting feature; their oxygen isotopic composition has been interpreted to indicate that more than 4.4 billion years ago there was already water on the surface of the Earth. The importance and accuracy of these interpretations is currently the subject of scientific debate. It may be that the oxygen isotopes and other compositional features (the rare-earth elements) record more recent hydrothermal alteration of the zircons rather than the composition of the magma at the time of their original crystallization.[citation needed] In a paper published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters, a team of scientists suggest that rocky continents and liquid water existed at least 4.3 billion years ago and were subjected to heavy weathering by an acrid climate. Using an ion microprobe to analyze isotope ratios of the element lithium in zircons from the Jack Hills in Western Australia, and comparing these chemical fingerprints to lithium compositions in zircons from continental crust and primitive rocks similar to the Earth's mantle, they found evidence that the young planet already had the beginnings of continents, relatively cool temperatures and liquid water by the time the Australian zircons formed.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the oldest Martian meteorites found on Earth, ALH84001, discovered in the Allan Hills of Antarctica, has been reported to have crystallized from molten rock 4.091 billion years ago.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Genesis Rock (Lunar sample 15415), obtained from the Moon by astronauts during Apollo 15 mission, has been dated at 4.08 billion years.[14] During Apollo 16, older rocks, including Lunar sample 67215, dated at 4.46 billion years, were brought back.[15] Lunar sample 67215 is the oldest known rock on Earth, even though it originated on the Moon.","input":"Where are the oldest rocks in north america?"},{"output":"May 20, 1902","context":"The Republic of Cuba (Spanish: Rep~blica de Cuba) of 1902 to 1959, refers to the historical period in Cuba from 1902, when Cuba seceded from US rule in the aftermath of the SpanishÿAmerican War that took Cuba from Spanish rule in 1898, until communist revolutionaries took power in 1959.\\r\\nThe official form of government was representative democracy though at times it was controlled by a military junta or otherwise unelected government. After becoming head of the armed forces in 1933, colonel Fulgencio Batista played a dominant role in Cuban politics over the next decades. The Cuban Revolution of 1953ÿ1959 massively changed Cuban society, creating a socialist state and ending US economic dominance in Cuba, as it aligned the country with the Soviet Union.\\r\\nThe Republic of Cuba has been regarded as a client state of the United States.[1] From 1902ÿ1932 Cuban and United States law included the Platt Amendment, which guaranteed the US right to intervene in Cuba and placed restrictions on Cuban foreign relations.[2] In 1934, Cuba and the United States signed the Treaty of Relations in which Cuba was obligated to give preferential treatment of its economy to the United States, in exchange the United States gave Cuba a guaranteed 22 percent share of the US sugar market that later was amended to a 49 percent share in 1949.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the SpanishÿAmerican War, Spain and the United States signed the Treaty of Paris (1898), by which Spain ceded Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam to the United States for the sum of $20 million.[4] Cuba gained formal independence from the U.S. on May 20, 1902, as the Republic of Cuba.[5] Under Cuba's new constitution, the U.S. retained the right to intervene in Cuban affairs and to supervise its finances and foreign relations. Under the Platt Amendment, the U.S. leased the Guantnamo Bay naval base from Cuba.\\r\\nFollowing disputed elections in 1906, the first president, Toms Estrada Palma, faced an armed revolt by veterans of the war for independence who defeated the government's meager forces.[6] The U.S. intervened by occupying Cuba and named Charles Edward Magoon as Governor for three years. Cuban historians have attributed Magoon's governorship as having introduced political and social corruption.[7]\\r\\nIn 1908, self-government was restored when Jos Miguel G܇mez was elected President, but the U.S. continued intervening in Cuban affairs. In 1912, the Partido Independiente de Color attempted to establish a separate black republic in Oriente Province,[8] but was suppressed by General Monteagudo with considerable bloodshed.\\r\\nSugar production played an important rule in Cuban politics and economics. In the 1910s, during and after World War I, a shortage in the world sugar supply fueled an economic boom in Cuba, marked by prosperity and the conversion of more and more farmland to sugar cultivation. Prices peaked and then crashed in 1920, ruining the country financially and allowing foreign investors to gain more power than they already had. This economic turbulence was called \\"the Dance of the Millions\\".[9][10]\\r\\nIn 1924, Gerardo Machado was elected president. During his administration, tourism increased markedly, and American-owned hotels and restaurants were built to accommodate the influx of tourists. The tourist boom led to increases in gambling and prostitution in Cuba.[11] Machado initially enjoyed support from much of the public and from all the country's major political parties. However, his popularity declined steadily. In 1928 he held an election which was to give him another term, this one of six years, despite his promise to serve only for one term.\\r\\nThe Wall Street Crash of 1929 led to precipitous drops in the price of sugar, political unrest, and repression.[12] Protesting students, known as the Generation of 1930, and a clandestine terrorist organization known as the ABC, turned to violence in opposition to the increasingly unpopular Machado.[12]\\r\\nUS ambassador Sumner Welles arrived in May 1933 and began a diplomatic campaign which involved \\"mediation\\" with opposition groups in including the ABC. This campaign significantly weakened Machado's government and, backed with the threat of military intervention, set the stage for a regime change.[13]\\r\\nA general strike (in which the Communist Party sided with Machado),[14] uprisings among sugar workers, and an army revolt forced Machado into exile in August 1933. He was replaced by Carlos Manuel de Cspedes y Quesada, son of Cuban patriot Carlos Manuel de Cspedes and former ambassador to the US.[12]\\r\\nIn September 1933, the Sergeants' Revolt, led by Sergeant Fulgencio Batista, overthrew Cspedes.[15] General Alberto Herrera served briefly as president (August 12ÿ13) followed by Carlos Manuel de Cspedes y Quesada from August 13 until September 5, 1933. A five-member executive committee (the Pentarchy of 1933) was chosen to head a provisional government.[16] They were ousted by a student-led organization, the Student Directory, which appointed Ramon Grau San Martin as provisional president and passed various reforms during the ensuing One Hundred Days Government.[16] Grau resigned in 1934, after which Batista dominated Cuban politics for the next 25 years, at first through a series of puppet-presidents.[15] The period from 1933 to 1937 was a time of \\"virtually unremitting social and political warfare\\".[17]\\r\\nA new constitution was adopted in 1940, which engineered radical progressive ideas, including the right to labor and health care.[18] Batista was elected president in the same year, holding the post until 1944.[19] He is so far the only non-white Cuban to win the nation's highest political office.[20][21][22] His government carried out major social reforms. Several members of the Communist Party held office under his administration.[23] Cuban armed forces were not greatly involved in combat during World War?II, although president Batista suggested a joint U.S.-Latin American assault on Francoist Spain in order to overthrow its authoritarian regime.[24]\\r\\nBatista adhered to the 1940 constitution's strictures preventing his re-election.[25] Ramon Grau San Martin was the winner of the next election, in 1944.[19] Grau further corroded the base of the already teetering legitimacy of the Cuban political system, in particular by undermining the deeply flawed, though not entirely ineffectual, Congress and Supreme Court.[26] Carlos Pro Socarrs, a protg of Grau, became president in 1948.[19] The two terms of the Autntico Party saw an influx of investment which fueled a boom and raised living standards for all segments of society and created a prosperous middle class in most urban areas.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter running unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1952, Batista staged a coup.[27] He outlawed the Cuban Communist Party in 1952.[28] Cuba had Latin America's highest per capita consumption rates of meat, vegetables, cereals, automobiles, telephones and radios, though about one third of the population was considered poor and enjoyed relatively little of this consumption.[29]\\r\\nIn 1958, Cuba was a relatively well-advanced country by Latin American standards, and in some cases by world standards.[30] On the other hand, Cuba was affected by perhaps the largest labor union privileges in Latin America, including bans on dismissals and mechanization. They were obtained in large measure \\"at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants\\", leading to disparities.[31] Between 1933 and 1958, Cuba extended economic regulations enormously, causing economic problems.[20][32] Unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs.[20] The middle class, which was comparable to that of the United States, became increasingly dissatisfied with unemployment and political persecution. The labor unions supported Batista until the very end.[20][21] Batista stayed in power until he was forced into exile in December 1958.[27]","input":"When did cuba gain independence from the us?"},{"output":"Christian Jacobs","context":"Yo Gabba Gabba! is an American live action/puppet children's television show starring five costumed toys-come-to-life and their friend DJ Lance Rock.

Yo Gabba Gabba! won for the year 2009 and 2010.[20] In February 2013, Yo Gabba Gabba! won two Kidscreen Awards for \\"Best Non-Animated or Mixed Series 2013\\" and \\"Best Music 2013\\"[21]\\r\\nOfficial sites\\r\\nChannels\\r\\nOthers","input":"Who is the creator of yo gabba gabba?"},{"output":"Sputnik 1","context":"Sputnik 1 (/?sp?tn?k/ or /?sp?tn?k/; \\"Satellite-1\\", or \\"PS-1\\", 楰Ѿҿ쳭ҳ Ťҷҿ-1 or Prosteyshiy Sputnik-1, \\"Elementary Satellite 1\\")[5] was the first artificial Earth satellite. The Soviet Union launched it into an elliptical low Earth orbit on 4 October 1957. It was a 58?cm (23?in) diameter polished metal sphere, with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses. Its radio signal was easily detectable even by amateurs, and the 65 inclination and duration of its orbit made its flight path cover virtually the entire inhabited Earth. This surprise success precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race, a part of the Cold War. The launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments.[6][7]\\r\\nTracking and studying Sputnik 1 from Earth provided scientists with valuable information, even though the satellite wasn't equipped with sensors. The density of the upper atmosphere could be deduced from its drag on the orbit, and the propagation of its radio signals gave information about the ionosphere.\\r\\nSputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now known as the Baikonur Cosmodrome). The satellite travelled at about 29,000 kilometres per hour (18,000?mph; 8,100?m/s), taking 96.2 minutes to complete each orbit. It transmitted on 20.005 and 40.002 MHz,[8] which were monitored by amateur radio operators throughout the world.[9] The signals continued for 21 days until the transmitter batteries ran out on 26 October 1957.[4] Sputnik burned up on 4 January 1958 while reentering Earth's atmosphere, after three months, 1440 completed orbits of the Earth,[1] and a distance travelled of about 70?million?km (43?million?mi).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 December 1954, chief Soviet rocket scientist Sergei Korolev proposed a developmental plan for an artificial satellite to Minister of Defence Industry Dimitri Ustinov. Korolev forwarded a report by Mikhail Tikhonravov with an overview of similar projects abroad.[11] Tikhonravov had emphasized that the launch of an orbital satellite was an inevitable stage in the development of rocket technology.[12]\\r\\nOn 29 July 1955, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced through his press secretary that the United States would launch an artificial satellite during the International Geophysical Year (IGY).[13] A week later, on 8 August, the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union approved the proposal to create an artificial satellite.[14] On 30 August Vasily Ryabikov ÿ the head of the State Commission on R-7 rocket test launches ÿ held a meeting where Korolev presented calculation data for a spaceflight trajectory to the Moon. They decided to develop a three-stage version of the R-7 rocket for satellite launches.[15]\\r\\nOn 30 January 1956 the Council of Ministers approved practical work on an artificial Earth-orbiting satellite. This satellite, named Object D, was planned to be completed in 1957ÿ58; it would have a mass of 1,000 to 1,400?kg (2,200 to 3,100?lb) and would carry 200 to 300?kg (440 to 660?lb) of scientific instruments.[16] The first test launch of \\"Object D\\" was scheduled for 1957.[12] Work on the satellite was to be divided between institutions as follows:[17]\\r\\nPreliminary design work was completed by July 1956 and the scientific tasks to be carried out by the satellite were defined. These included measuring the density of the atmosphere and its ion composition, the solar wind, magnetic fields, and cosmic rays. These data would be valuable in the creation of future artificial satellites. A system of ground stations was to be developed to collect data transmitted by the satellite, observe the satellite's orbit, and transmit commands to the satellite. Because of the limited time frame, observations were planned for only 7 to 10 days and orbit calculations were not expected to be extremely accurate.[18]\\r\\nBy the end of 1956 it became clear that the complexity of the ambitious design meant that 'Object D' could not be launched in time because of difficulties creating scientific instruments and the low specific impulse produced by the completed R-7 engines (304 sec instead of the planned 309 to 310 sec). Consequently, the government rescheduled the launch for April 1958.[12] Object D would later fly as Sputnik 3.[19]\\r\\nFearing the U.S. would launch a satellite before the USSR, OKB-1 suggested the creation and launch of a satellite in AprilÿMay 1957, before the IGY began in July 1957. The new satellite would be simple, light (100?kg or 220?lb), and easy to construct, forgoing the complex, heavy scientific equipment in favour of a simple radio transmitter. On 15 February 1957 the Council of Ministers of the USSR approved this simple satellite, designated 'Object PS'.[20] This version allowed the satellite to be tracked visually by Earth-based observers, and it could transmit tracking signals to ground-based receiving stations.[20] The launch of two satellites, PS-1 and PS-2, with two R-7 rockets (8K71) was approved, provided that the R-7 completed at least two successful test flights.[20]\\r\\nThe R-7 Semyorka was initially designed as an ICBM by OKB-1. The decision to build it was made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR on 20 May 1954.[21] The R-7 was also known by its GRAU (later GURVO) designation 8K71.[22] At the time, the R-7 was known to NATO sources as the T-3 or M-104,[23] and Type A.[24] A special reconnaissance commission selected Tyuratam for the construction of a rocket proving ground (the 5th Tyuratam range, usually referred to as \\"NIIP-5\\", or \\"GIK-5\\" in the post-Soviet time). The selection was approved on 12 February 1955 by the Council of Ministers of the USSR, but the site would not be completed until 1958.[25] Actual work on the construction of the site began on 20 July by military building units. On 14 June 1956 Sergei Korolev decided to adapt the R-7 rocket to the 'Object D',[26] that would later be replaced by the much lighter 'Object PS'.\\r\\nThe first launch of an R-7 rocket (8K71 No.5L) occurred on 15 May 1957. A fire began in the Blok D strap-on almost immediately at liftoff, but the booster continued flying until T+98 seconds when the strap-on broke away and the vehicle crashed some 400?km downrange.[27] Three attempts to launch the second rocket (8K71 No.6) were made on 10ÿ11 June, but an assembly defect prevented launch.[28] The unsuccessful launch of the third R-7 rocket (8K71 No.7) took place on 12 July.[27] An electrical short caused the vernier engines to put the missile into an uncontrolled roll which resulted in all of the strap-ons separating 33 seconds into the launch. The R-7 crashed about 7?km from the pad.[29]\\r\\nThe launch of the fourth rocket (8K71 No.8), on 21 August at 15:25 Moscow Time,[27] was successful. The rocket's core boosted the dummy warhead to the target altitude and velocity, reentered the atmosphere, and broke apart at a height of 10?km (6.2?mi) after traveling 6,000?km. On 27 August TASS issued a statement on the successful launch of a long-distance multistage ICBM. The launch of the fifth R-7 rocket (8K71 No.9), on 7 September[27] was also successful, but the dummy was also destroyed on atmospheric re-entry,[29] and hence needed a redesign to completely fulfill its military purpose. The rocket, however, was deemed suitable for satellite launches, and Korolev was able to convince the State Commission to allow the use of the next R-7 to launch PS-1,[30] allowing the delay in the rocket's military exploitation to launch the PS-1 and PS-2 satellites.[31][32]\\r\\nOn 22 September a modified R-7 rocket, named Sputnik and indexed as 8K71PS,[33] arrived at the proving ground and preparations for the launch of PS-1 began.[34] Compared to the military R-7 test vehicles, the mass of 8K71PS was reduced from 280 tonnes to 272 tonnes; its length with PS-1 was 29.167 metres (95?ft 8.3?in) and the thrust at lift off was 3.90?MN (880,000?lbf).[35] These weight reductions were accomplished by deleting the inertial guidance system, several telemetry measurements, and assorted hardware designed to support a warhead.\\r\\nPS-1 was not designed to be controlled, it could only be observed. Initial data at the launch site would be collected at six separate observatories and telegraphed to NII-4.[31] Located back in Moscow (at Bolshevo), NII-4 was a scientific research arm of the Ministry of Defence dedicated to missile development.[36] The six observatories, designated IP-1 through IP-6, were clustered around the launch site, with the closest (IP-1) situated at a distance of 1?km (0.62?mi) from the launch pad.[31]\\r\\nA second, nationwide observation complex was established to track the satellite after its separation from the rocket. Called the Command-Measurement Complex, it consisted of the coordination center in NII-4 and seven distant stations situated along the line of the satellite's ground track.[37] These tracking stations were located at Tyuratam; Sary-Shagan; Yeniseysk; Klyuchi; Yelizovo; Makat in Guryev Oblast; and Ishkup in Krasnoyarsk Krai.[31][37] Stations were equipped with radar, optical instruments, and communications systems. Data from stations were transmitted by telegraphs into NII-4 where ballistics specialists calculated orbital parameters. The complex became an early prototype of the Soviet Mission Control Center.[38]\\r\\nThe observatories used a trajectory measurement system called \\"Tral,\\" developed by OKB MEI, by which they received and monitored data from transponders mounted on the R-7 rocket's core stage.[39] The data was useful even after the satellite's separation from the second stage of the rocket; Sputnik's location was calculated from the data on the second stage's location which followed Sputnik at a known distance.[40] Tracking of the booster during launch had to be accomplished through purely passive means such as visual coverage and radar detection. R-7 test launches demonstrated that the tracking cameras were only good up to an altitude of 200?km (120?mi) but radar could track it for almost 400?km (250?mi).\\r\\nOutside the Soviet Union, the satellite was tracked by amateur radio operators in many countries.[41] The US government followed it from the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards.[42] The booster rocket was located and tracked by the British using the Lovell Telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, the only telescope in the world able to do so by radar.[41] Canada's Newbrook Observatory was the first facility in North America to photograph Sputnik 1.[43]\\r\\nThe chief constructor of Sputnik 1 at OKB-1 was Mikhail S. Khomyakov.[44] The satellite was a 585-millimetre (23.0?in) diameter sphere, assembled from two hemispheres that were hermetically sealed with o-rings and connected by 36 bolts. It had a mass of 83.6 kilograms (184?lb).[45] The hemispheres were 2?mm thick,[46] and were covered with a highly polished 1?mm-thick heat shield[47] made of aluminium-magnesium-titanium AMG6T alloy (\\"AMG\\" is an abbreviation for \\"aluminium-magnesium\\" and \\"T\\" stands for \\"titanium\\"; the alloy is 6% magnesium and 0.2% titanium[48]). The satellite carried two pairs of antennas designed by the Antenna Laboratory of OKB-1 led by Mikhail V. Krayushkin.[17] Each antenna was made up of two whip-like parts: 2.4 and 2.9 meters (7.9 and 9.5?ft) in length,[49] and had an almost spherical radiation pattern,[50] so that the satellite beeps were transmitted with equal power in all directions, making reception of the transmitted signal independent of the satellite's rotation.\\r\\nThe power supply, with a mass of 51?kg (112?lb),[51] was in the shape of an octagonal nut with the radio transmitter in its hole.[52] It consisted of three silver-zinc batteries, developed at the All-Union Research Institute of Current Sources (VNIIT) under the leadership of Nikolai S. Lidorenko. Two of these batteries powered the radio transmitter and one powered the temperature regulation system.[51] The batteries had an expected lifetime of two weeks, and operated for 22 days. The power supply was turned on automatically at the moment of the satellite's separation from the second stage of the rocket.[53]\\r\\nThe satellite had a one-watt, 3.5?kg (7.7?lb)[31] radio transmitting unit inside, developed by Vyacheslav I. Lappo from NII-885, the Moscow Electronics Research Institute,[53][54] that worked on two frequencies, 20.005 and 40.002?MHz. Signals on the first frequency were transmitted in 0.3 sec pulses (under normal temperature and pressure conditions on-board), with pauses of the same duration filled by pulses on the second frequency.[55] Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere. Temperature and pressure were encoded in the duration of radio beeps. A temperature regulation system contained a fan, a dual thermal switch, and a control thermal switch.[53] If the temperature inside the satellite exceeded 36?C (97?F) the fan was turned on and when it fell below 20?C (68?F) the fan was turned off by the dual thermal switch.[50] If the temperature exceeded 50?C (122?F) or fell below 0?C (32?F), another control thermal switch was activated, changing the duration of the radio signal pulses.[53] Sputnik 1 was filled with dry nitrogen, pressurized to 1.3 atm.[33] The satellite had a barometric switch, activated if the pressure inside the satellite fell below 130 kPa, which would have indicated failure of the pressure vessel or puncture by a meteor, and would have changed the duration of radio signal impulse.[56]\\r\\nWhile attached to the rocket, Sputnik 1 was protected by a cone-shaped payload fairing, with a height of 80?cm (31.5?in).[31] The fairing separated from both Sputnik and the spent R-7 second stage at the same time as the satellite was ejected.[53] Tests of the satellite were conducted at OKB-1 under the leadership of Oleg G. Ivanovsky.[44]\\r\\nThe control system of the Sputnik rocket was adjusted to an intended orbit of 223 by 1,450?km (139 by 901?mi), with an orbital period of 101.5 min.[57] The trajectory had been calculated earlier by Georgi Grechko, using the USSR Academy of Sciences' mainframe computer.[31][58]\\r\\nThe Sputnik rocket was launched on 4 October 1957 at 19:28:34?UTC (5 October at the launch site[1]) from Site No.1 at NIIP-5.[59] Telemetry indicated that the strap-ons separated 116 seconds into the flight and the core stage engine shut down 295.4 seconds into the flight.[57] At shut down, the 7.5 tonne core stage with PS-1 attached had attained an altitude of 223?km (139?mi) above sea level, a velocity of 7,780?m/s (25,500?ft/s) and velocity vector inclination to the local horizon of 0 degrees 24 minutes. This resulted in an initial orbit of 223 kilometres (139?mi) by 950 kilometres (590?mi), with an apogee approximately 500 kilometres (310?mi) lower than intended, and an inclination of 65.1 degrees and a period of 96.2 minutes.[57]\\r\\nThe launch came very close to failurea postflight examination of telemetry data found that the Blok G strap-on had not attained full power at ignition and the resulting imbalanced thrust caused the booster to pitch over about 2 six seconds after liftoff. Two seconds later, the flight control system tried to compensate by rapidly moving the vernier engines and stabilizer fins. The Blok G strap-on finally reached 100% thrust only one second before the pitch angle would have been great enough to trigger an automatic shutdown command, which would have terminated the launch and sent the R-7 and Sputnik 1 crashing to the ground in a fireball only a short distance from the pad.\\r\\nA fuel regulator in the booster also failed around 16 seconds into launch, which resulted in excessive RP-1 consumption for most of powered flight and engine thrust 4% above nominal. Core stage cutoff was intended for T+296 seconds, but the premature propellant depletion caused thrust termination to occur one second earlier when a sensor detected overspeed of the empty RP-1 turbopump. There were 375 kilograms (827?lb) of LOX remaining at cutoff.[60]\\r\\nAt 19.9 seconds after engine cut-off, PS-1 separated from the second stage[1] and the satellite's transmitter was activated. These signals were detected at the IP-1 station by Junior Engineer-Lieutenant V.G. Borisov, where reception of Sputnik 1's \\"beep-beep-beep\\" tones confirmed the satellite's successful deployment. Reception lasted for two minutes, until PS-1 fell below the horizon.[31][61] The Tral telemetry system on the R-7 core stage continued to transmit and was detected on its second orbit.[1]\\r\\nThe designers, engineers and technicians who developed the rocket and satellite watched the launch from the range.[62] After the launch they drove to the mobile radio station to listen for signals from the satellite.[62] They waited about 90 minutes to ensure that the satellite had made one orbit and was transmitting, before Korolev called Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev.[63]\\r\\nOn the first orbit the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) transmitted: \\"As result of great, intense work of scientific institutes and design bureaus the first artificial Earth satellite has been built\\".[64] The R-7 core stage, with a mass of 7.5 tonnes and a length of 26 meters, also reached Earth orbit and was visible from the ground at night as a first magnitude object following the satellite. Deployable reflective panels were placed on the booster in order to increase its visibility for tracking.[63] The satellite, a small, highly polished sphere, was barely visible at sixth magnitude, and thus more difficult to follow optically. A third object, the payload fairing, also achieved orbit.\\r\\nThe core stage of the R-7 remained in orbit for two months until 2 December 1957, while Sputnik 1 orbited for three months, until 4 January 1958, having completed 1,440 orbits of the Earth.[1]\\r\\nOur movies and television programs in the fifties were full of the idea of going into space. What came as a surprise was that it was the Soviet Union that launched the first satellite. It is hard to recall the atmosphere of the time.\\r\\nThe Soviets provided details of Sputnik 1 before the launch but few outside the Soviet Union noticed. After reviewing information publicly available before the launch, the science writer Willy Ley wrote in 1958:\\r\\nIf somebody tells me that he has the rockets to shoot  which we know from other sources, anyway  and tells me what he will shoot, how he will shoot it, and in general says virtually everything except for the precise date  well, what should I feel like if I'm surprised when the man shoots?\\"[66]\\r\\nOrganized through the citizen science project Operation Moonwatch, teams of visual observers at 150 stations in the United States and other countries were alerted during the night to watch for the Soviet sphere at dawn and during the evening twilight through binoculars or telescopes as it passed overhead.[67] The USSR asked radio amateurs and commercial stations to record the sound of the satellite on magnetic tape.[67]\\r\\nNews reports at the time pointed out that \\"anyone possessing a short wave receiver can hear the new Russian earth satellite as it hurtles over this area of the globe\\".[this quote needs a citation] Directions, provided by the American Radio Relay League were to \\"Tune in 20 megacycles sharply, by the time signals, given on that frequency. Then tune to slightly higher frequencies. The 'beep, beep' sound of the satellite can be heard each time it rounds the globe.\\"[69] The first recording of Sputnik 1's signal was made by RCA engineers near Riverhead, Long Island. They then drove the tape recording into Manhattan for broadcast to the public over NBC radio. However, as Sputnik rose higher over the East Coast, its signal was picked up by ham station W2AEE, the ham radio station of Columbia University. Students working in the university's FM station, WKCR, made a tape of this, and were the first to rebroadcast the Sputnik signal to the American public (or whoever could receive the FM station).\\r\\nAt first the Soviet Union agreed to use equipment \\"compatible\\" with that of the United States, but later announced the lower frequencies.[67] The White House declined to comment on military aspects of the launch, but said \\"it did not come as a surprise.\\"[70] On 5 October the Naval Research Laboratory announced it had recorded four crossings of Sputnik 1 over the United States.[67] The USAF Cambridge Research Center collaborated with Bendix-Friez, Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to obtain a motion picture of Sputnik's rocket body crossing the pre-dawn sky of Baltimore, broadcast on 12 October by WBZ-TV in Boston.[71] U.S. President Eisenhower obtained photographs of the Soviet facilities from Lockheed U-2 flights conducted since 1956.[72]\\r\\nThe success of Sputnik 1 seemed to have changed minds around the world regarding a shift in power to the Soviets.[73]\\r\\nThe USSR's launch of Sputnik 1 spurred the United States to create the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later DARPA) in February 1958 to regain a technological lead.[74][75][76]\\r\\nIn Britain the media and population initially reacted with a mixture of fear for the future, but also amazement about humankind's progress. Many newspapers and magazines heralded the arrival of the Space Age. However, when the Soviet Union launched a second craft containing the dog Laika, the media narrative returned to one of anti-communism and many people sent protests to the Russian embassy and the RSPCA.[77]\\r\\nSputnik 1 was not immediately used for Soviet propaganda. The Soviets had kept quiet about their earlier accomplishments in rocketry, fearing that it would lead to secrets being revealed and failures being exploited by the West.[78] When the Soviets began using Sputnik in their propaganda, they emphasized pride in the achievement of Soviet technology, arguing that it demonstrated the Soviets' superiority over the West. People were encouraged to listen to Sputnik's signals on the radio[78] and to look out for Sputnik in the night sky. While Sputnik itself had been highly polished, its small size made it barely visible to the naked eye. What most watchers actually saw was the much more visible 26 meter core stage of the R-7.[78] Shortly after the launch of PS-1, Khrushchev pressed Korolev to launch another satellite in time for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution on 7 November 1957.[79]\\r\\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 surprised the American public and shattered the perception, furthered by American propaganda, of the United States as the technological superpower and the Soviet Union as a backward country.[80] Privately, however, the CIA and President Eisenhower were aware of progress being made by the Soviets on Sputnik from secret spy plane imagery.[81] Together with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Army Ballistic Missile Agency built Explorer 1, and launched it on 31 January 1958. Before work was completed, however, the Soviet Union launched a second satellite, Sputnik 2, on 3 November 1957. Meanwhile, the televised failure of Vanguard TV3 on 6 December 1957 deepened American dismay over the country's position in the Space Race. The Americans took a more aggressive stance in the emerging space race,[82] resulting in an emphasis on science and technological research and reforms in many areas from the military to education systems.[83] The federal government began investing in science, engineering and mathematics at all levels of education.[80][84] An advanced research group was assembled for military purposes.[80] These research groups developed weapons such as ICBMs and missile defense systems, as well as spy satellites for the U.S.[80]\\r\\nOn Friday, 4 October 1957, the Soviets had orbited the world's first artificial satellite. Anyone who doubted its existence could walk into the backyard just after sunset and see it.\\r\\nInitially U.S. President Eisenhower was not surprised by Sputnik 1. He had been forewarned of the R-7s capabilities by information derived from U-2 spy plane overflight photos, as well as signals and telemetry intercepts.[86][87] The Eisenhower administration's first response was low-key and almost dismissive.[88] Eisenhower was even pleased that the USSR, not the U.S., would be the first to test the waters of the still-uncertain legal status of orbital satellite overflights.[89] Eisenhower had suffered the Soviet protests and shoot-downs of Project Genetrix (Moby Dick) balloons[90] and was concerned about the probability of a U-2 being shot down.[91] To set a precedent for \\"freedom of space\\" before the launch of America's secret WS-117L spy satellites,[92] the U.S. had launched Project Vanguard as its own \\"civilian\\" satellite entry for the International Geophysical Year.[93] Eisenhower greatly underestimated the reaction of the American public, who were shocked by the launch of Sputnik and by the televised failure of the Vanguard Test Vehicle 3 launch attempt. The sense of fear was inflamed by Democratic politicians and professional cold warriors, who portrayed the United States as woefully behind.[94] One of the many books that suddenly appeared for the lay-audience noted seven points of \\"impact\\" upon the nation: Western leadership, Western strategy and tactics, missile production, applied research, basic research, education, and democratic culture.[23]\\r\\nThe U.S. soon had a number of successful satellites, including Explorer 1, Project SCORE, and Courier 1B. However, public reaction to the Sputnik crisis led to the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA in 1972),[95] NASA,[96] and an increase in U.S. government spending on scientific research and education. Not only did the launch of Sputnik spur America to action in the space race, it also led directly to the creation of NASA through the space act bill.\\r\\nSputnik also contributed directly to a new emphasis on science and technology in American schools. With a sense of urgency, Congress enacted the 1958 National Defense Education Act, which provided low-interest loans for college tuition to students majoring in math and science.[97][98] After the launch of Sputnik, a poll conducted and published by the University of Michigan showed that 26% of Americans surveyed thought that Russian sciences and engineering were superior to that of the United States. (A year later, however, that figure had dropped to 10% as the U.S. began launching its own satellites into space.)[99]\\r\\nOne consequence of the Sputnik shock was the perception of a \\"missile gap.\\"[100] This became a dominant issue in the 1960 Presidential campaign.\\r\\nOne irony of the Sputnik event was the initially low-key response of the Soviet Union. The Communist Party newspaper Pravda only printed a few paragraphs about Sputnik 1 on 4 October.[101] In the days following the world's startled response, the Soviets started celebrating their great accomplishment.\\r\\nSputnik also inspired a generation of engineers and scientists. Harrison Storms, the North American designer who was responsible for the X-15 rocket plane, and went on to head the effort to design the Apollo Command/Service Module and Saturn V launch vehicle's second stage was moved by the launch of Sputnik to think of space as being the next step for America.[102] Astronauts Alan Shepard, who was the first American in space, and Deke Slayton later wrote of how the sight of Sputnik I passing overhead inspired them to their new careers.[103] Homer Hickam's memoir Rocket Boys and the movie October Sky tell the story of how a coal miner's son, inspired by Sputnik, started building rockets in the mining town where he lived.\\r\\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 inspired United States writer Herb Caen to coin the term \\"beatnik\\" in an article about the Beat Generation in the San Francisco Chronicle on 2 April 1958.[104]\\r\\nAt least two vintage duplicates of Sputnik 1 exist, built apparently as backup units. One resides just outside Moscow in the corporate museum of Energia, the modern descendant of Korolev's design bureau, where it is on display by appointment only.[105][106] Another is in the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington. Unlike Energia's unit, it has no internal components, but it does have casings and molded fittings inside (as well as evidence of battery wear), which suggest it was built as more than just a model. Authenticated by the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics in Moscow, the unit was auctioned in 2001 and purchased by an anonymous private buyer who donated it to the museum.[105] Two more Sputnik backups are said to be in the personal collections of American entrepreneurs Richard Garriott[105] and Jay S. Walker.[107]\\r\\nIn 1959, the Soviet Union donated a replica of Sputnik to the United Nations.[108] There are dozens of other full-size Sputnik replicas, more or less accurate, on display in locations around the world, including the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.;[105] the Frontiers of Flight Museum and the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, both in Texas;[105][109] the Armstrong Air and Space Museum and the National Museum of the United States Air Force, both in Ohio; the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, Kansas; the California Science Center in Los Angeles; the Science Museum, London; the World Museum in Liverpool; the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia and outside the Russian embassy in Madrid, Spain.\\r\\nThree one-third scale student-built replicas of Sputnik 1 were deployed from the Mir space station between 1997 and 1999. The first, named Sputnik 40 to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the launch of Sputnik 1, was deployed in November 1997.[72] Sputnik 41 was launched a year later, and Sputnik 99 was deployed in February 1999. A fourth replica was launched, but never deployed, and was destroyed when Mir was deorbited.[105][110]","input":"Who is the first man made satellite in space?"},{"output":"Sir Edmund Percival Hillary","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Edmund Percival Hillary KG ONZ KBE OSN (20 July 1919 ÿ 11 January 2008) was a New Zealand mountaineer, explorer, and philanthropist.

He subsequently reached the North Pole, making him the first person to reach both poles and summit Everest.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing his ascent of Everest, Hillary devoted himself to assisting the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he established. His efforts are credited with the construction of many schools and hospitals in Nepal. From 1985 to 1988 he served as New Zealand's High Commissioner to India and Bangladesh and concurrently as Ambassador to Nepal. Hillary had numerous honours conferred upon him, including the Order of the Garter in 1995. Upon his death in 2008, he was given a state funeral in New Zealand.\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary was born to Percival Augustus and Gertrude (ne Clark) Hillary in Auckland, New Zealand, on 20 July 1919.[1][2] His father Percy had served at Gallipoli with the 15th (North Auckland) Regiment, and was discharged \\"medically unfit\\" from the Army in 1916; he had married Gertrude after his return to New Zealand. His grandparents had emigrated from Yorkshire to northern Wairoa in the mid-19th century.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis family moved to Tuakau, south of Auckland, in 1920, after Percy was allocated eight acres (3.2 ha) of land there as a returned soldier.[2] Percy had been a journalist prewar, and soon became founding editor of the weekly Tuakau District News as well as an apiarist. Ed had a sister June (born 1917) and a brother Rex (born 1920).[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary was educated at Tuakau Primary School and then Auckland Grammar School.[2] He finished primary school aged 11 or two years early, and at \\"Grammar\\"  achieved average marks.[5] His mother wanted him to go to a \\"good school\\" and he commuted by train, cycling to Tuakau station before 7 am and returning after 6 pm for 3? years (a one hour and 40 minutes journey each way) until the family moved to Remuera, Auckland in 1935, his last of four years at \\"Grammar\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was initially smaller than his peers and shy, and did not enjoy \\"Grammar\\", where commuting barred him from after-school activities. He grew to be 6?feet 2?inches (188?cm)[7] and gained confidence after taking up boxing. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe became interested in climbing when he was 16 following a 1935 school trip to Mount Ruapehu, after which he showed more interest in tramping than in studying and said he \\"wanted to see the world\\".[8] He then attended Auckland University College, and joined the Tramping Club there. But in 1938 \\"after two notably unsuccessful years studying mathematics and science\\" he gave up on formal education.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then became an apiarist (beekeeper) with his father and brother Rex; with 1600 hives to attend, thousands of 90 lb (41 kg) boxes of honey comb to handle, and 12 to 100 bee-stings daily.[9][1][10]. So he kept bees in summer, and concentrated on climbing in winter.[11] His father also edited the journal \\"The N.Z. Honeybee\\" and his mother Gertrude was famous for breeding and selling queen bees.[12][13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1938 he went to hear Herbert Sutcliffe, the proponent of a life philosophy called \\"Radiant Living\\", with his family. The family all became foundation members, and his mother became its secretary in 1939. He went to Gisborne as Sutcliffs assistant, and in 1941 sat examinations to become a teacher of Radiant Living, getting a 100% pass mark. His test lecture was on \\"Inferiority ÿ cause and cure\\". He said of his five year association with the movement that \\"I learned to speak confidently from the platform; to think more freely on important topics; to mix more readily with a wide variety of people\\". Tenets included healthy eating (the salads that June took to university for lunch) and pacificism. He joined the Radiant Living Tramping Club, and further developed his love of the outdoors in the Waitakere Ranges.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1939 he completed his first major climb, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier, near Aoraki / Mount Cook in the Southern Alps.[2] Climbing brought new friends; Harry Ayres and George Lowe became \\"the first real friends I'd ever had\\". [17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Hillary applied to join the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) but quickly withdrew the application, later writing that he was \\"harassed by my religious conscience\\".[18] In 1943, with the Japanese threat in the Pacific and the arrival of conscription, he joined the RNZAF as a navigator in No. 6 Squadron RNZAF and later No. 5 Squadron RNZAF on Catalina flying boats.[18][19] In 1945, he was sent to Fiji and to the Solomon Islands, where he was badly burnt in an accident.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1948, Hillary and others ascended the south ridge of Aoraki / Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest peak.[20]\\r\\nIn 1951 he was part of a British reconnaissance expedition to Everest led by Eric Shipton,[21] before joining the successful British attempt of 1953. In 1952, Hillary and George Lowe were part of the British team led by Shipton, that attempted Cho Oyu.[22] After that attempt failed due to the lack of route from the Nepal side, Hillary and Lowe crossed the Nup La pass into Tibet and reached the old Camp II, on the northern side, where all the previous expeditions had camped.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1949, the long-standing climbing route to the summit of Everest was closed by Chinese-controlled Tibet. For the next several years, Nepal allowed only one or two expeditions per year.[25] A Swiss expedition (in which Tenzing took part) attempted to reach the summit in 1952, but was forced back by bad weather around 800 feet (240?m) below the summit.[26] In 1952 Hillary learned that he and Lowe had been invited by the Joint Himalayan Committee for the 1953 British attempt and immediately accepted.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nShipton was named as leader but was replaced by Hunt. Hillary was immediately impressed by Hunt's energy and determination.[28] Hillary had intended to climb with Lowe, but Hunt named two teams for the ascent: Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans; and Hillary and Tenzing.[29] Hillary, therefore, made a concerted effort to forge a working friendship with Tenzing.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hunt expedition totalled over 400 people, including 362 porters, 20 Sherpa guides, and 10,000 pounds (4,500?kg) of baggage.[30][31] Lowe supervised the preparation of the Lhotse Face, a huge and steep ice face, for climbing. Hillary forged a route through the treacherous Khumbu Icefall.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expedition set up base camp in March 1953 and, working slowly, set up its final camp at the South Col at 25,900 feet (7,890?m). On 26 May, Bourdillon and Evans attempted the climb but turned back when Evans' oxygen system failed. The pair had reached the South Summit, coming within 300 vertical feet (91 m) of the summit.[31][34] Hunt then directed Hillary and Tenzing to attempt the summit.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow and wind delayed them at the South Col for two days. They set out on 28 May with the support of Lowe, Alfred Gregory, and Ang Nyima.[35] The two pitched a tent at 27,900 feet (8,500?m) on 28 May, while their support group returned down the mountain.[36] On the following morning Hillary discovered that his boots had frozen solid outside the tent. He spent two hours warming them over a stove before he and Tenzing, wearing 30-pound (14?kg) packs, attempted the final ascent.[37] The final obstacle was the 40-foot (12?m) rock face now called \\"Hillary Step\\"; Hillary later wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nI noticed a crack between the rock and the snow sticking to the East Face. I crawled inside and wriggled and jammed my way to the top?... Tenzing slowly joined me and we moved on. I chopped steps over bump after bump, wondering a little desperately where the top could be. Then I saw the ridge ahead dropped away to the north and above me on the right was a rounded snow dome. A few more whacks with my ice-axe and Tenzing and I stood on top of Everest.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nTenzing later wrote that Hillary took the first step onto the summit and he followed. They reached Everest's 29,028?ft (8,848 m) summit?ÿ the highest point on earth?ÿ at 11:30?am.[1][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey spent about 15 minutes at the summit. Hillary took a photo of Tenzing posing with his ice-axe, but there is no photo of Hillary. BBC News attributed this to Tenzing's having never used a camera;[40][41] Tenzing's autobiography says that Hillary simply declined to have his picture taken.\\r\\nThey also took photos looking down the mountain.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nTenzing left chocolates at the summit as an offering, and Hillary left a cross given to him by John Hunt.[42] Their descent was complicated by drifting snow which had covered their tracks. The first person they met was Lowe; Hillary said, \\"Well, George, we knocked the bastard off.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey returned to Kathmandu a few days later and learned that Hillary had already been appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire and Hunt a Knight Bachelor.[43] News reached Britain on the day of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, and the press called it a coronation gift.[44] \\r\\nThe 37 members of the party later received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal with mount everest expedition engraved along the rim.[45]\\r\\nIn addition to the knighting of Hillary and Hunt, Tenzing?ÿ ineligible for knighthood as a Nepalese citizen?ÿ received the George Medal.[46][47][48] Tenzing also received the Star of Nepal from King Tribhuvan.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary climbed ten other peaks in the Himalayas on further visits in 1956, 1960ÿ1961, and 1963ÿ1965.  He also reached the South Pole as part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, for which he led the New Zealand section, on 4 January 1958. His party was the first to reach the Pole overland since Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912, and the first ever to do so using motor vehicles.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960 Hillary organized an expedition to search for the fabled abominable snowman.[51] Hillary was with the expedition for five months, although it lasted for ten.[52] No evidence of Yetis was found, instead footprints and tracks were proven to be from other causes. During the expedition, Hillary travelled to remote temples which contained \\"Yeti scalps\\"; however after bringing back three relics, two were shown to be from bears and one from a goat antelope.[53][54] Hillary said after the expedition: \\"The yeti is not a strange, superhuman creature as has been imagined. We have found rational explanations for most yeti phenomena\\".[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1962 he was a guest on the television game show What's My Line?; he stumped the panel, comprising Dorothy Kilgallen, Arlene Francis, Bennett Cerf, and Merv Griffin.[56]\\r\\nIn 1977, he led a jetboat expedition, titled \\"Ocean to Sky\\", from the mouth of the Ganges River to its source.[57]  From 1977 to 1979 he commentated aboard Antarctic sightseeing flights operated by Air New Zealand.[58]\\r\\nIn 1985, he accompanied Neil Armstrong in a small twin-engined ski plane over the Arctic Ocean and landed at the North Pole. Hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of Everest.[59][60][61][62] This accomplishment inspired generations of explorers to compete over what later was defined as Three Poles Challenge.\\r\\nIn January 2007, Hillary travelled to Antarctica as part of a delegation commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of Scott Base.[63][64][65]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 June 1953 Hillary was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire and received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal the same year.[66] On 6 February 1987, he was the fourth appointee to the Order of New Zealand.[67] He was also awarded the Polar Medal in 1958 for his part in the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition,[68][69] the Order of Gorkha Dakshina Bahu, 1st Class of the Kingdom of Nepal in 1953, and the Coronation Medal in 1975.[70] On 22 April 1995 Hillary was appointed Knight Companion of The Most Noble Order of the Garter.[71][72] On 17 June 2004 Hillary was awarded Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland.[73] The Government of India conferred on him its second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, posthumously, in 2008.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo mark the 50th anniversary of the first successful ascent of Everest, the Nepalese government conferred honorary citizenship upon Hillary at a special Golden Jubilee celebration in Kathmandu, Nepal. He was the first foreign national to receive that honour.[75][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1992, New Zealand's $5 note has featured Hillary's portrait, making him the only living person not a current head of state ever to appear on a New Zealand banknote. In giving his permission, Hillary insisted that Aoraki / Mount Cook rather than Mount Everest be used as the backdrop.[76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual Reader's Digest polls from 2005 to 2007 named Hillary as \\"New Zealand's most trusted individual\\".[79][80]\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary's favoured New Zealand charity was the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre, of which he was patron for 35 years.[81] He was particularly keen on how this organisation introduced young New Zealanders to the outdoors in a very similar way to his first experience of a school trip to Mt Ruapehu at the age of 16. A 2.3-metre (7.5?ft) bronze statue of Hillary was erected outside The Hermitage Hotel at Mount Cook Village; it was unveiled by Hillary himself in 2003.[82] Various streets, institutions and organisations around New Zealand and abroad are named after him ÿ for example, the Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate in Otara, which was established by Hillary in 2001.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo Antarctic features are named after Hillary. The Hillary Coast is a section of coastline south of Ross Island and north of the Shackleton Coast.[84] The Hillary Canyon, an undersea feature in the Ross Sea, appears on the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, published by the International Hydrographic Organization.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary married Louise Mary Rose on 3 September 1953, soon after the ascent of Everest; he admitted he was terrified of proposing to her and relied on her mother to propose on his behalf.[10][11][86] They had three children: Peter (born 1954), Sarah (born 1955) and Belinda (1959ÿ1975).[1][34] In 1975 while en route to join Hillary in the village of Phaphlu, where he was helping to build a hospital, Louise and Belinda were killed in a plane crash near Kathmandu airport shortly after take-off.[10] In 1989 he married June Mulgrew, the widow of his close friend Peter Mulgrew, who died on Air New Zealand Flight 901 in 1979.[11][87]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis son Peter Hillary also became a climber, summiting Everest in 1990. In May 2002 Peter climbed Everest as part of a 50th anniversary celebration; Jamling Tenzing Norgay (son of Tenzing who had died in 1986) was also part of the expedition.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary's home for most of his life was a property on Remuera Road in Auckland City,[89] where he enjoyed reading adventure and science fiction novels in his retirement.[89]\\r\\nHe also built a bach at Whites Beach,[90] one of Auckland's west coast beaches in the former Waitakere City, between Anawhata and North Piha;[91][92] a friend called it Hillary's place of solace, where he could escape media attention.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hillary family has had a connection with the west coast of Auckland since 1925, when Louise's father built a bach at Anawhata.[93] The family donated land at Whites Beach that is now crossed by trampers on the Hillary Trail, named for Edmund.[94]\\r\\nHillary said of the area: \\"That is the thing that international travel brings home to me ÿ it's always good to be going home.\\r\\nThis is the only place I want to live in; this is the place I want to see out my days.\\"[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing his ascent of Everest he devoted himself to assisting the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he established in 1960[96] and led until his death in 2008. His efforts are credited with the construction of many schools and hospitals in this remote region of the Himalayas. He was the Honorary President of the American Himalayan Foundation, a United States non-profit body that helps improve the ecology and living conditions in the Himalayas. He was also the Honorary President of Mountain Wilderness, an international NGO dedicated to the worldwide protection of mountains.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary supported the Labour Party in the 1975 New Zealand general election, as a member of the \\"Citizens for Rowling\\" campaign. His involvement in this campaign was seen as precluding his nomination as Governor-General;[98] the position was offered to Keith Holyoake in 1977. In 1985, Hillary was appointed New Zealand High Commissioner to India (concurrently High Commissioner to Bangladesh and Ambassador to Nepal) and spent four and a half years based in New Delhi.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1975, Hillary served as a vice president for the Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand,[100] a national pro-choice advocacy group.[101] He was also a patron of REPEAL, an organization seeking repeal of the restrictive Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 22 April 2007, while on a trip to Kathmandu, Hillary suffered a fall, and was hospitalised after returning to New Zealand.[102]\\r\\nOn 11 January 2008 he died of heart failure at Auckland City Hospital.[103]\\r\\nFlags were lowered to half-mast on New Zealand public buildings and at Scott Base in Antarctica,[104] and Prime Minister Helen Clark called Hillary's death a \\"profound loss to New Zealand\\".[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 21 January, Hillary's casket was taken into Holy Trinity Cathedral, Auckland, to lie in state.[106]\\r\\nA state funeral was held on 22 January 2008,[107] after which his body was cremated. On 29 February 2008 most of his ashes were scattered in Auckland's Hauraki Gulf per his desire.[108] The remainder went to a Nepalese monastery near Everest; a plan to scatter them on the summit was cancelled in 2010.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2008, Lukla Airport, in Lukla, Nepal, was renamed to TenzingÿHillary Airport in recognition of their promotion of its construction.[110][111]\\r\\nOn 2 April 2008, a service of thanksgiving in Hillary's honour at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle was attended by Queen Elizabeth, New Zealand dignitaries including Prime Minister Helen Clark, and members of Hillary's and Norgay's families; Gurkha soldiers from Nepal stood guard outside the ceremony.[112][113]\\r\\nIn October 2008, it was announced that future rugby test matches between England and New Zealand would be played for the Hillary Shield.[114] In 2009 the Duke of Edinburgh's Award in New Zealand?ÿ formerly the Young New Zealanders' Challenge?ÿ was renamed \\"The Duke of Edinburgh's Hillary Award\\".[115]\\r\\nOn 5 November 2008, a commemorative set of five stamps was issued by New Zealand Post.[116][117]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been many calls for lasting tributes to Hillary. The first major public tribute has been by way of the \\"Summits for Ed\\" tribute tour organised by the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation.[118] This tribute tour went from Bluff at the bottom of the South Island to Cape Reinga at the tip of the North Island, visiting 39 towns and cities along the way. In each venue, school children and members of the public were invited to join together to climb a significant hill or site in their area to show their respect for Hillary. The public were also invited to bring small rocks or pebbles that had special significance to them, that would be included in a memorial to Hillary at the base of Mt Ruapehu, in the grounds of the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre. Funds donated during the tour are used by the foundation to sponsor young New Zealanders on outdoor courses. Over 8,000 persons attended these \\"Summit\\" climbs between March and May 2008.[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tribute song \\"Hillary 88\\", by the New Zealand duo The Kiwis, is the official world memorial song for Hillary, with the endorsement of Lady Hillary.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nA four-day track in the Waitakere Ranges, along Auckland's west coast, is named the Hillary Trail,[121] in honour of Hillary.[94] Hillary's father-in-law, Jim Rose, who had built a bach at Anawhata in 1925, wrote in his 1982 history of Anawhata Beach, \\"My family look forward to the time when we will be able to walk from Huia to Muriwai on public walking tracks like the old-time Maori could do\\".[93][122] Hillary loved the area, and had his own bach near Anawhata. The track was opened on 11 January 2010, the second anniversary of Hillary's death.[103][123] Rose Track, descending from Anawhata Road to Whites Beach, is named after the Rose family.[95][124]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South Ridge of Aoraki / Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest mountain, was renamed Hillary Ridge on 18 August 2011. Hillary and three other climbers were the first party to successfully climb the ridge in 1948.[125] In September 2013 the Government of Nepal proposed naming a 7,681 metres (25,200?ft) mountain in Nepal Hillary Peak in his honour.[126] After the New Horizons mission discovered a mountain range on Pluto on 14 July 2015, it was informally named Hillary Montes (Hillary Mountains) by NASA.[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sir Edmund Hillary Mountain Legacy Medal, awarded by the Nepalese NGO Mountain Legacy \\"for remarkable service in the conservation of culture and nature in mountainous regions\\" was inaugurated in 2003, with the approval of Sir Edmund Hillary. \\r\\nA bronze bust of Hillary (circa 1953) by Ophelia Gordon Bell is in the Te Papa museum in Wellington, New Zealand.[128]\\r\\nThe Sir Edmund Hillary Archive was added to the UNESCO Memory of the world archive in 2013,[129] it is currently held by Auckland War Memorial Museum.[130]","input":"Who were the first two persons to scale mt.everest?"},{"output":"21 or older.","context":"Gun laws in Iowa regulate the sale, possession, and use of firearms and ammunition in the state of Iowa in the United States.\\r\\nOn January 1, 2011, Iowa became a \\"shall issue\\" state for a permit to carry weapons on one's person.[1] Applicants must successfully complete an approved training course.\\r\\nIowa will honor any valid permit issued by any other state.

Williams won the most WTA singles titles of the season with seven titles which included two grand slam titles at Wimbledon and the US Open. She also won the WTA Championships and her first singles Olympics gold. She suffered her first first round loss in a slam at the French Open losing to Virginie Razzano.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn doubles, Williams, partnering with sister Venus, dominated the grass court season by triumphing at Wimbledon and winning women's doubles gold medal at the Summer Olympics. Serena Williams was voted WTA Player of the Year for 2012, the fourth time she has won this award.[1] Based on her brilliant show in 2012, Serena was named as International Tennis Federation world champion.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliams began her 2012 season at the Brisbane International where she defeated Chanelle Scheepers in the first round in straight sets. At the second round, she faced Bojana Jovanovski and served for the match when she twisted her left ankle. She eventually won the match breaking the Serbians serve in the tenth game. However, the next day, she withdrew in her quarterfinals match against Daniela Hantuchov due to the same injury.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliams then played the Australian Open where she was on a 14-match winning streak after winning the event in 2009 and 2010 but missing the 2011 edition. She was able to cruise pass the first three rounds. She beat Austrian Tamira Paszek in straight sets hitting 34 winners but also made 26 unforced error, in a first round match that started 30 minutes to 12 midnight.[4] At the second round, she defeated Barbora Zhlavov-Strycov winning the first set at love and breaking serve once and by doing so, she earned her 500th tour win.[5] She then cruise pass Hungarian Grta Arn with a loss of only 2 games to make through the fourth round. The match ended with 2 double faults and 59 minutes.[6] At the fourth round, she suffered a surprising loss to Russian Ekaterina Makarova at the fourth match point of the Russian.

The loss ended her 17 match winning streak at the Open.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe originally was set to participate in mixed doubles partnering with Andy Roddick.[8] The team withdrew before their first round match due to Roddick's hamstring injury.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nComing into the Sony Ericsson Open, Williams was attempting to break the record she shares with Steffi Graf of 5 titles and 7 finals at the event. She was also returning after a two-year hiatus with the 2009 edition was the latest edition she participated in. As the tenth seed, she received a bye in the first round. In the second round, she faced China's Zhang Shuai and won easily with 6 aces.[10] She followed it up with a loss of only three games over Roberta Vinci.[11] In the fourth round, she faced Samantha Stosur.

However, she lost winning four games in both sets in an error-stricken match where she committed 34 winners and 36 unforced errors to Wozniacki's 12 winners and 13 unforced errors.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliams started her clay season campaign at the Family Circle Cup, having not played on clay since the 2010 French Open. As the fifth seed, she received a bye in the first round. In the second round, she faced Elena Vesnina and won with a break lead in each set, closing out the match win her 11th ace.[14] In the next round, she faced New Zealand's Marina Erakovic and won with a double fault from Erakovic and with Serena winning 10 of the last 12 games.[15] In her quarterfinals match, her opponent, Sabine Lisicki, had to retire after twisting her left ankle at 3rd game.[16] In the semifinals, she faced Samantha Stosur whom just outlasted Venus Williams in her quarterfinals match. Williams dominated the match with a double breadstick win in just under an hour and breaking the Aussie five times.[17] In the final, she met Lucie ?af?ov for her first title of 2012.

Having lost their last match-up at Miami, a sluggish start from Williams looked similar to Miami as Wozniacki won the first set easily losing only one game. However, Williams avenged her loss at Miami and got back, winning the next two sets with 43 winners.[21] In the quarterfinals she faced her third Russian opponent in the tournament, Maria Sharapova, with whom she had a 7ÿ2 lead against Sharapova. Williams continued her streak with a victory and 11 aces.[22] In the semifinals she ended the run of Czech qualifier, Lucie Hradeck. The first set was a tight contest with Williams edging Hradeck in the tie-break. The second set was a contrast with Williams winning with a bagel.[23] In the final, she faced world no. 1, Victoria Azarenka, and dominated the match losing only four games in the victory. Williams hit 13 aces in the match and she also improved her record against Belorussian to 7ÿ1.

Williams led their head-to-head 6ÿ3, but Petrova won their last 2 meetings.[27] In the first set, the Russian edged it out winning it with a single break.

However, Williams was forced to withdraw with a lower back injury as a precaution heading into the French Open.[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliams came to the French Open as the heavy favorite for the title. In the first round, the fifth seeded Williams was drawn against local player ranked 111th in the world, Virginie Razzano. She, surprisingly, lost to the Frenchwoman in three sets, marking the first time she lost in a grandslam opener in her career. Williams was two points away from victory nine times in the second set including leading 5ÿ1 in the tiebreak. However, she failed to capitalize her chances and Razzano took the set and forced a third set to be played. Razzano quickly took control of the third set and, even though Williams managed to save seven match points, she fell to Razzano.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliams also returned to mixed doubles competition for the first time since the 1999 Australian Open. She played with Bob Bryan and was drawn against Gisela Dulko and Eduardo Schwank in the first round.

The second set was tighter, but Williams prevailed, breaking in the ninth game and then serving it out to advanced to the third round against China's Zheng Jie.[37] Zheng kept toe-to-toe with Williams by holding her serve to force a tie-break, which Zheng won with the aid of a few errors from the American. However, Williams dominated the second set, winning it at two including winning the final 13 points of the set to force it to a decider. Both player kept their serve until the 4th game where Williams had to save 3 break points. The match went on serve until Williams broke in the 14th game and served it out.

Williams took care of the first set, winning it with a single break. In the second set, Williams broke early at the third game; however, the Belorussian broke back in the sixth game, as both players held serve to push the second set into a tie-break, which Williams won with her 24th ace in her second match point and first on her own serve. Williams broke her own record set in the third round of 23 aces. It was her fifth win in a row against Azarenka.[43] Williams' opponent in the final was first-time Slam finalist Agnieszka Radwaska. Williams dominated the first set, winning it, winning the first five games and closing it out in the seventh game. Williams led by a break against the Polish no. 3 seed before a rain-delay.

Ellis Island was opened January 1, 1892. The island was greatly expanded with land reclamation between 1892 and 1934. Before that, the much smaller original island was the site of Fort Gibson and later a naval magazine. The island was made part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument in 1965 and has hosted a museum of immigration since 1990.\\r\\nIt was long considered part of New York, but a 1998 United States Supreme Court decision found that most of the island is in New Jersey.[9] The south side of the island, home to the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital, is closed to the general public and the object of restoration efforts spearheaded by Save Ellis Island.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEllis Island is in Upper New York Bay, east of Liberty State Park and north of Liberty Island, in Jersey City, New Jersey, with a small section that is part of New York City.[10][11] Largely created through land reclamation, the island has a land area of 27.5 acres (11.1?ha), most of which is part of New Jersey. The 2.74-acre (1.11?ha) natural island and contiguous areas comprise the 3.3 acres (1.3?ha) that are part of New York.[11][12]\\r\\nThe island has been owned and administered by the federal government of the United States since 1808 and operated by the National Park Service since 1965.[13]\\r\\nSince the September 11 attacks in 2001, the island is guarded by patrols of the United States Park Police Marine Patrol Unit. Public access is by ferry from either Communipaw Terminal in Liberty State Park or from the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan. The ferry operator, Hornblower Cruises and Events, also provides service to the nearby Statue of Liberty.[14] A bridge built for transporting materials and personnel during restoration projects connects Ellis Island with Liberty State Park but is not open to the public. The city of New York and the private ferry operator at the time opposed proposals to use it or replace it with a pedestrian bridge.[15]\\r\\nMuch of the island, including the entire south side, has been closed to the public since 1954. The renovated area on the north side was again closed to the public after Hurricane Sandy in October 2012.[16] The island was re-opened to the public and the museum partially re-opened on October 28, 2013, after major renovations.[17][18][19]\\r\\nOriginally much of the west shore of Upper New York Bay consisted of large tidal flats which hosted vast oyster banks, a major source of food for the Lenape population who lived in the area prior to the arrival of Dutch settlers. There were several islands which were not completely submerged at high tide. Three of them (later to be known as Liberty Island, Black Tom Island and Ellis Island) were given the name Oyster Islands by the settlers of New Netherland, the first European colony in the region. The oyster beds remained a major source of food for nearly three centuries.[20][21][22] Landfilling to build the railyards of the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Central Railroad of New Jersey eventually obliterated the oyster beds, engulfed one island, and brought the shoreline much closer to the others.[23] During the colonial period, Little Oyster Island was known as Dyre's, then Bucking Island. In the 1760s, after some pirates were hanged from one of the island's scrubby trees, it became known as Gibbet Island.[24] It was acquired by Samuel Ellis, a colonial New Yorker and merchant possibly from Wales, around the time of the American Revolution.[25] In 1785, he unsuccessfully attempted to sell the island:[26]\\r\\nTO BE SOLD\\r\\nBy Samuel Ellis, no. 1, Greenwich Street, at the north river near the Bear Market, That pleasant situated Island called Oyster Island, lying in New York Bay, near Powle's Hook, together with all its improvements which are considerable;...\\r\\nThe State of New York leased the island in 1794 and started to fortify it in 1795. Ownership was in question and legislation was passed for acquisition by condemnation in 1807 and then ceded to the United States in 1808.[27] Shortly thereafter the War Department established a circular stone 14-gun battery, a mortar battery (possibly of six mortars), magazine, and barracks.[28][29][30] This was part of what was later called the second system of U.S. fortifications. From 1808 until 1814 it was a federal arsenal. The fort was initially called Crown Fort, but by the end of the War of 1812 the battery was named Fort Gibson, after Colonel James Gibson of the 4th Regiment of Riflemen, killed in the Siege of Fort Erie during the war.[31][32] Parts of the wall foundations of the fort were uncovered while excavating for the Immigrant Wall of Honor, and they are preserved with an interpretive plaque. The island remained a military post for nearly 80 years[33] before it was selected to be a federal immigration station.\\r\\nIn the 35 years before Ellis Island opened, more than eight million immigrants arriving in New York City had been processed by officials at Castle Garden Immigration Depot in Lower Manhattan, just across the bay.[33] The federal government assumed control of immigration on April 18, 1890, and Congress appropriated $75,000 to construct America's first federal immigration station on Ellis Island. Artesian wells were dug, and fill material was hauled in from incoming ships' ballast and from construction of New York City's subway tunnels, which doubled the size of Ellis Island to over six acres. While the building was under construction, the Barge Office nearby at the Battery was used for immigrant processing.\\r\\nThe first station was a three-story-tall structure with outbuildings, built of Georgia Pine, containing the amenities thought to be necessary. It opened with fanfare on January 1, 1892.[24] Three large ships landed on the first day, and 700 immigrants passed over the docks. Almost 450,000 immigrants were processed at the station during its first year. On June 15, 1897, a fire of unknown origin, possibly caused by faulty wiring, turned the wooden structures on Ellis Island into ashes. No loss of life was reported, but most of the immigration records dating back to 1855 were destroyed. About 1.5 million immigrants had been processed at the first building during its five years of use. Plans were immediately made to build a new, fireproof immigration station. During the construction period, passenger arrivals were again processed at the Barge Office.[24] Edward Lippincott Tilton and William A. Boring won the 1897 competition to design the first phase, including the Main Building (1897ÿ1900), Kitchen and Laundry Building (1900ÿ01), Main Powerhouse (1900ÿ01), and the Main Hospital Building (1900ÿ01).[34]\\r\\nThe present main structure was designed in French Renaissance Revival style and built of red brick with limestone trim. After it opened on December 17, 1900, the facilities proved barely able to handle the flood of immigrants that arrived in the years before World War I. In 1913, writer Louis Adamic came to America from Slovenia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and described the night he and many other immigrants slept on bunk beds in a huge hall. Lacking a warm blanket, the young man \\"shivered, sleepless, all night, listening to snores\\" and dreams \\"in perhaps a dozen different languages\\". The facility was so large that the dining room could seat 1,000 people. It is reported the islands first immigrant to be processed through was a teenager named Annie Moore from County Cork in Ireland.[35]\\r\\nAfter its opening, Ellis Island was again expanded, and additional structures were built. By the time it closed on November 12, 1954, 12 million immigrants had been processed by the U.S. Bureau of Immigration.[33] It is estimated that 10.5 million immigrants departed for points across the United States from the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal, just across a narrow strait.[36][37] Others would have used one of the other terminals along the North River (Hudson River) at that time.[38] At first, the majority of immigrants arriving through the station were Northern and Western Europeans (Germany, France, Switzerland, Belgium, The Netherlands, Great Britain, and the Scandinavian countries). Eventually, these groups of peoples slowed in the rates that they were coming in, and immigrants came in from Southern and Eastern Europe, including Jews. Many reasons these immigrants came to the United States included escaping political and economic oppression, as well as persecution, destitution, and violence. Other groups of peoples being processed through the station were Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, Serbs, Slovaks, Greeks, Syrians, Turks, and Armenians.[8]\\r\\nBetween 1905 and 1914, an average of one million immigrants per year arrived in the United States. Immigration officials reviewed about 5,000 immigrants per day during peak times at Ellis Island.[39] Two-thirds of those individuals emigrated from eastern, southern and central Europe.[40] The peak year for immigration at Ellis Island was 1907, with 1,004,756 immigrants processed. The all-time daily high occurred on April 17, 1907, when 11,747 immigrants arrived.[24] After the Immigration Act of 1924 was passed, which greatly restricted immigration and allowed processing at overseas embassies, the only immigrants to pass through the station were those who had problems with their immigration paperwork, displaced persons, and war refugees.[41] Today, over 100 million Americans  about one-third to 40% of the population of the United States  can trace their ancestry to immigrants who arrived in America at Ellis Island before dispersing to points all over the country.[42]\\r\\nGenerally, those immigrants who were approved spent from two to five hours at Ellis Island. Arrivals were asked 29 questions including name, occupation, and the amount of money carried. It was important to the American government the new arrivals could support themselves and have money to get started. The average the government wanted the immigrants to have was between 18 and 25 dollars ($600 in 2015 adjusted for inflation). Those with visible health problems or diseases were sent home or held in the island's hospital facilities for long periods of time. More than 3,000 would-be immigrants died on Ellis Island while being held in the hospital facilities. Some unskilled workers were rejected because they were considered \\"likely to become a public charge.\\" About 2% were denied admission to the U.S. and sent back to their countries of origin for reasons such as having a chronic contagious disease, criminal background, or insanity.[43] Ellis Island was sometimes known as \\"The Island of Tears\\" or \\"Heartbreak Island\\"[44] because of those 2% who were not admitted after the long transatlantic voyage. The Kissing Post is a wooden column outside the Registry Room, where new arrivals were greeted by their relatives and friends, typically with tears, hugs, and kisses.[45][46]\\r\\nDuring World War I, the German sabotage of the Black Tom Wharf ammunition depot damaged buildings on Ellis Island. The repairs included the Main Hall's current barrel-vaulted ceiling.\\r\\nTo support the activities of the United States Bureau of Immigration, the United States Public Health Service operated an extensive medical service at the immigrant station, called U.S. Marine Hospital Number 43, more widely known as the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital. It was the nation's largest marine hospital. Uniformed military surgeons staffed the medical division, which was active in the hospital wards, the Barge Office at the Battery and the Main Building. They are best known for the role they played during the line inspection, in which they employed unusual techniques such as the use of the buttonhook to examine immigrants for signs of eye diseases (particularly, trachoma) and the use of a chalk mark code. Symbols were chalked on the clothing of potentially sick immigrants following the six-second medical examination. The doctors would look at the immigrants as they climbed the stairs from the baggage area to the Great Hall. Immigrants' behavior would be studied for difficulties in getting up the staircase. Some immigrants supposedly entered the country by surreptitiously wiping the chalk marks off, or by turning their clothes inside out.[47]\\r\\nThe symbols used were:\\r\\nU.S. Immigrant Inspectors used some other symbols or marks as they interrogated immigrants in the Registry Room to determine whether to admit or detain them, including:\\r\\nMany of the people immigrating to America hailed from Europe, with Eastern Europe and Southern European immigrants being the primary groups. During this time period, eugenic ideals gained broad popularity and made heavy impact on immigration to the United States by way of exclusion of disabled and \\"morally defective\\" people.[citation needed]\\r\\nEugenicists of the late 19th and early 20th century believed reproductive selection should be carried out by the state as a collective decision.[48] For many eugenicists, this was considered a patriotic duty as they held an interest in creating a greater national race. Henry Fairfield Osborn's opening words to the New York Evening Journal in 1911 were, \\"As a biologist as well as a patriot...,\\" on the subject on advocating for tighter inspections of immigrants of the United States.[49]\\r\\nEugenic selection occurred on two distinguishable levels:\\r\\nAt the time, it was a broadly popular idea that immigration policies had ought to be based off eugenics principles in order to help create a \\"superior race\\" in America. To do this, defective persons needed to be screened by immigration officials and denied entry on the basis of their disability.[51]\\r\\nTypes of defects screened for included:\\r\\nThe people with moral or mental disability were of higher concern to officials and under the law, mandatorily excluded from immigrating to the United States. Persons with physical disability were under higher inspection and could be turned way on the basis of their disability. Much of this came in part of the eugenicist belief that defects were hereditary, especially those of the moral and mental nature those these were often outwardly signified by physical deformity as well.[48]\\r\\nIn 1898, a Chicago surgeon named Eugene S. Talbot (Eugene Solomon) wrote \\"crime is hereditary, a tendency which is, in most cases, associated with bodily defects.\\"[52] Likewise, George Lydston, a medicine and criminal anthropology professor, argued further in 1906 that people with \\"defective physique\\" were not just criminally associated but that defectiveness was a primary factor \\"in the causation of crime.\\"[53]\\r\\nBetween 1891 and 1930, Ellis Island reviewed over 25 million attempted immigrations. Of this 25 million, 700,000 were given certificates of disability or disease and of these 79,000 were barred from entry. Approximately 4.4% of immigrants between 1909 and 1930 were classified as disabled or diseased per with 11% being deported when this number spiked to 8.0% in the years of 1918-1919. One percent of immigrants were deported yearly due to medical causes.[54]\\r\\nWith the passing of the Emergency Quota Act of 1921, the number of immigrants being allowed into the United States declined greatly. The passing of the bill ended the era of mass immigration.[8] After 1924, Ellis Island became primarily a detention and deportation processing station.[24][55]\\r\\nDuring and immediately following World War II, Ellis Island was used to hold German merchant mariners and \\"enemy aliens\\"Axis nationals detained for fear of spying, sabotage, and other fifth column activity. In December 1941, Ellis Island held 279 Japanese, 248 Germans, and 81 Italians removed from the East Coast.[56] Unlike other wartime immigration detention stations, Ellis Island was designated as a permanent holding facility and was used to hold foreign nationals throughout the war.[57] A total of 7,000 Germans, Italians and Japanese would be ultimately detained at Ellis Island.[24] It was also a processing center for returning sick or wounded U.S. soldiers, and a Coast Guard training base. Ellis Island still managed to process tens of thousands of immigrants per year during this time, but many fewer than the hundreds of thousands per year who arrived before the war. After the war, immigration rapidly returned to earlier levels.\\r\\nThe Internal Security Act of 1950 barred members of communist or fascist organizations from immigrating to the United States. Ellis Island saw detention peak at 1,500, but by 1952, after changes to immigration laws and policies, only 30 detainees remained.[24]\\r\\nOne of the last detainees was the Indonesian Aceh separatist Hasan di Tiro who, while a student in New York in 1953, declared himself the \\"foreign minister\\" of the rebellious Darul Islam movement.[58] Due to this action, he was immediately stripped of his Indonesian citizenship, causing him to be imprisoned for a few months on Ellis Island as \\"an illegal alien.\\"[58]\\r\\nThe station's commissioners were:[59][60]\\r\\nOther notable officials at Ellis Island included James R. O'Beirne (assistant commissioner, 1890ÿ93), Edward F. McSweeney (assistant commissioner, 1893-1902), Joseph E. Murray (assistant commissioner, 1902ÿ09), Byron Uhl (assistant commissioner, 1909-1940), Dr. George W. Stoner (chief surgeon), Augustus Frederick Sherman (chief clerk), Dr. Victor Heiser (surgeon) (surgeon), Dr. Thomas W. Salmon (surgeon), Dr. Howard Knox (surgeon), Antonio Frabasilis (interpreter), Peter Mikolainis (interpreter), Maud Mosher (matron), Fiorello H. La Guardia (interpreter), Samuel Hays, (special immigrant inspector)Roman Dobler (immigrant inspector), Philip Cowen (immigrant inspector), Philip Forman (immigrant inspector, 1930s; chief of detention, deportation and parole, 1940s, 1950s) and De Jalma West (immigrant inspector).\\r\\nProminent amongst the missionaries and immigrant aid workers were Rev. Michael J. Henry and Rev. Anthony J. Grogan (Irish Catholic), Rev. Gaspare Moretto (Italian Catholic), Alma E. Mathews (Methodist), Rev. Georg Doring (German Lutheran), Rev. Joseph L'Etauche (Polish Catholic), Rev. Reuben Breed (Episcopal), Michael Lodsin (Baptist), Brigadier Thomas Johnson (Salvation Army), Ludmila K. Foxlee (YWCA), Athena Marmaroff (Woman's Christian Temperance Union), Alexander Harkavy (HIAS), and Cecilia Greenstone and Cecilia Razovsky (National Council of Jewish Women).\\r\\nA myth persists that government officials on Ellis Island compelled immigrants to take new names against their wishes.[62][63] In fact, no historical records bear this out. Immigration inspectors used the passenger lists they received from the steamship companies to process each foreigner. These were the sole immigration records for entering the country and were prepared not by the U.S. Bureau of Immigration but by steamship companies such as the Cunard Line, the White Star Line, the North German Lloyd Line, the Hamburg-Amerika Line, the Italian Steam Navigation Company, the Red Star Line, the Holland America Line, and the Austro-American Line.[64][65] The Americanization of many immigrant families' surnames was for the most part adopted by the family after the immigration process, or by the second or third generation of the family after some assimilation into American culture. However, many last names were altered slightly because of the disparity between English and other languages in the pronunciation of certain letters of the alphabet.[66]\\r\\nThe first immigrant to pass through Ellis Island was Annie Moore, a 17-year-old girl from Cork, Ireland, who arrived on the ship Nevada on January 1, 1892.[67] She and her two brothers were coming to America to meet their parents, who had moved to New York two years prior. She received a greeting from officials and a $10 gold coin.[68] It was the largest sum of money she had ever owned.\\r\\nThe last person to pass through Ellis Island was Norwegian merchant seaman Arne Peterssen in 1954.\\r\\nThe wooden structure built in 1892 to house the immigration station burned down after five years. The station's new Main Building, which now houses the Immigration Museum, was opened in 1900.[69] Architects Edward Lippincott Tilton and William Alciphron Boring received a gold medal at the 1900 Paris Exposition for the building's design and constructed the building at a cost of $1.5 million.[70] The architecture competition was the second under the Tarsney Act, which had permitted private architects rather than government architects in the Treasury Department's Office of the Supervising Architect to design federal buildings.[71]\\r\\nAfter the immigration station closed in November 1954, the buildings fell into disrepair and were abandoned. Attempts at redeveloping the site were unsuccessful until its landmark status was established. On October 15, 1965, Ellis Island was proclaimed a part of Statue of Liberty National Monument. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.\\r\\nBoston-based architectural firm Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc, together with the New York architectural firm Beyer Blinder Belle, designed the restoration and adaptive use of the Beaux-Arts Main Building, one of the most symbolically important structures in American history. A construction budget of $150 million was required for this significant restoration. This money was raised by a campaign organized by the political fundraiser Wyatt A. Stewart.[72] The building reopened on September 10, 1990.[73] Exhibits include Hearing Room, Peak Immigration Years, the Peopling of America, Restoring a Landmark, Silent Voices, Treasures from Home, and Ellis Island Chronicles. There are also three theaters used for film and live performances.[74]\\r\\nOn May 20, 2015, the Ellis Island Immigration Museum was officially renamed the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration, coinciding with the opening of the new Peopling of America galleries. The expansion tells the entire story of American immigration, including before and after the Ellis Island era. The Peopling of America Center was designed by ESI Design and fabricated by Hadley Exhibits, Inc. The architectural design was done by Highland Associates, with construction executed by Phelps Construction Group.[75]\\r\\nThe Wall of Honor outside of the main building contains a partial list of immigrants processed on the island.[76] Inclusion on the list is made possible by a donation to support the facility. In 2008 the museum's library was officially named the Bob Hope Memorial Library in honor of one the station's most famous immigrants.\\r\\nThe Ellis Island Medal of Honor is awarded annually at ceremonies on the island.\\r\\nThe south side of the island, home to the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital, is closed to the general public and the object of restoration efforts spearheaded by Save Ellis Island.\\r\\nMany of the facilities at Ellis Island were abandoned and remain unrenovated.[77] The entire south side, called by some the \\"sad side\\" of the island, is off limits to the general public. The Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital operated here from early 1902 to 1930.[78][79] The foundation Save Ellis Island is spearheading preservation efforts. The New Ferry Building, built in the Art Deco style to replace an earlier one, was renovated in 2008, but remains only partially accessible to the general public.[80]\\r\\nAs part of the National Park Service's Centennial Initiative, the south side of the island was to be the target of a project to restore the 28 buildings that have not yet been rehabilitated.[81]\\r\\nThe circumstances which led to an exclave of New York being located within New Jersey began in the colonial era, after the British takeover of New Netherland in 1664. An unusual clause in the colonial land grant outlined the territory that the proprietors of New Jersey would receive as being \\"westward of Long Island, and Manhitas Island and bounded on the east part by the main sea, and part by Hudson's river\\",[82] rather than at the river's midpoint, as was common in other colonial charters.[83]\\r\\nAttempts were made as early as 1804 to resolve the status of the state line.[84] The City of New York claimed the right to regulate trade on all the waters. This was contested in Gibbons v. Ogden,[85] which decided that the regulation of interstate commerce fell under the authority of the federal government, thus influencing competition in the newly developing steam ferry service in New York Harbor.\\r\\nIn 1830, New Jersey planned to bring suit to clarify the border, but the case was never heard.[86] The matter was resolved with a compact between the states, ratified by U.S. Congress in 1834, which set the boundary line between them as the middle of the Hudson River and New York Harbor.[87] This was later confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in other cases which also expounded on the compact.[23][88][89]\\r\\nThe federal government, which had bought the island in 1808, began expanding the island by land fill, to accommodate the immigration station opened in 1892. Land filling continued in stages until 1934.[90]\\r\\nNine-tenths of the current area is artificial island that did not exist at the time of the interstate compact. New Jersey contended that the new extensions were part of New Jersey, since they were outside New York's border and were in fact within New Jersey's border. In 1956, after the 1954 closing of the U.S. immigration station, the then Mayor of Jersey City, Bernard J. Berry, commandeered a U.S. Coast Guard cutter and led a contingent of New Jersey officials on an expedition to claim the island.[91] In 1997, the state filed suit to establish its jurisdiction, leading New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to remark dramatically that his father, an Italian who immigrated through Ellis Island, never intended to go to New Jersey.[92] The border was redrawn using information based on studies using geographic information science.[93]\\r\\nThe dispute eventually reached the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled in New Jersey v. New York 523 U.S. 767 (1998), that New Jersey had jurisdiction over all portions of the island created after the original compact was approved (effectively, more than 80% of the island's present land). This caused several immediate instances of confusion: some buildings, for instance, fell into the territory of both states. New Jersey and New York soon agreed to share jurisdiction of the island. It remains wholly a federal property, however, and these legal decisions do not result in either state taking any fiscal or physical responsibility for the maintenance, preservation, or improvement of any of the historic properties.[86][94][95]\\r\\nThe ruling had no effect on the status of Liberty Island, 4.17 acres (1.69?ha) of which was created by land reclamation.[96][97]\\r\\nFor New York State tax purposes, it is assessed as Manhattan Block 1, Lot 201. Since 1998, the 22.8 acre portion of the island in New Jersey has been assessed in Jersey City as Block 21603, Lot 1.[98][99]\\r\\nFrank Lloyd Wright designed a key plan for the island that included housing, hotels, and large domes along the edges. The co-curator of the traveling exhibit, \\"Never Built New York\\" in which it is included told AM New York, \\"It's pretty remarkable but at the same time it's a little bit horrifying that they could have gotten rid of Ellis Island.\\"[100]\\r\\nIn 1982 the National Parks Department embarked on an 8-year renovation. During that time, David Simonton was part of The Ellis Island Project: Documentation/Interpretation and captured stunning, black and white photos giving insight into immigrant's lives. Photographer Stephen Wilkes's series Ellis Island: Ghosts of Freedom (2006) captured the abandoned south side of Ellis Island.[101]\\r\\nEmergency services on Ellis Island are provided by the following emergency divisions of the National Park Service:\\r\\nEllis Island has been a source of inspiration or used as a subject in popular culture. Its imagery or representation has been employed in literature (including novels, short stories and poetry), in song, musical composition, dance, theatre, including vaudeville, burlesque, musical comedy, revue, legitimate theatre, motion pictures (silent and sound), newsreels, and in radio and television.\\r\\nEarly films, including those from the silent era, which feature the station include Traffic in Souls (1913), How The Jews Care for Their Poor (educational film, 1914) The Yellow Passport (1916), My Boy (1921), Frank Capra's The Strong Man (1926), We Americans (1928), The Mating Call (1928), This is Heaven (1929), Paddy O'Day (1935), Ellis Island (1936), Gateway (1938), Exile Express (1939), I, Jane Doe (1948), and Gambling House (1951). In The Godfather Part II, Vito Corleone immigrates via Ellis Island as a boy. The opening scene of The Brother From Another Planet is set there. The island is visited by the characters in the 2005 romantic comedy, Hitch, and is the setting for the climactic battle in X-Men.\\r\\nOver the decades, Ellis Island was also widely referenced or remarked on in books, such as Mrs 'Arris Goes to New York (1960) by Paul Gallico, and in popular films such as Cafe Metropole (1937) and With a Song in My Heart (1952).\\r\\nSome films have focused on the immigrant experience, such as the 1984 TV miniseries Ellis Island. The IMAX 3D movie Across the Sea of Time incorporates both modern footage and historical photographs of Ellis Island. The 2006 Italian movie The Golden Door, directed by Emanuele Crialese, takes place largely on Ellis Island. Forgotten Ellis Island, a film and book, focuses on the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital.[102] The Immigrant is a 2013 American drama film directed by James Gray, starring Marion Cotillard, Joaquin Phoenix, and Jeremy Renner.[103] Ellis, a short, premiered in November 2015.\\r\\nEllis Island as a port of entry is described in detail in Mottel the Cantor's Son by Sholom Aleichem.\\r\\nEllis Island: The Dream of America is a work for actors and orchestra with projected images by Peter Boyer, composed in 2001-02.

In many countries, food labeling laws make it easier for vegetarians to identify foods compatible with their diets.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReliable data is lacking due to a lack of polling and the varying definitions of vegetarianism and veganism used in the polls. For example, the latest US poll defines \\"vegan\\" according to diets that exclude meat, eggs and dairy, rather than following the accepted definition of veganism as avoiding all animal products as far as possible including honey and clothing. Other polls, like the latest Australian poll, place strict vegetarians and those who follow \\"almost\\" vegetarian diets in the same category, while this poll and many others measure only vegetarianism and neglect to include veganism in the poll. Many poll results are contradicted by other poll results from the same country despite similar publication dates, implying a wide margin of error.\\r\\nA study from 2010[2] estimated that there are 1,450 million vegetarians of necessity and another 75 million of choice. They make approximately 21.8% of the worlds population.\\r\\n2016[27] 2017[28]\\r\\n2016[43]\\r\\n2015[46] 2016[47] 2017[48]\\r\\n[50]\\r\\nAfrican diets are relatively plant-based for economic reasons, but the prevalence of strict ethical vegetarianism in Africa is reported to be low,[51] while scientific polls are lacking. Countries in North Africa have a tradition of cooking in a vegetarian style, with Morocco, Algeria, Libya and Tunisia being particularly connected with this type of cooking which includes couscous and spiced vegetables.[52] Indian immigrants to Africa, particularly in South Africa, brought vegetarianism with them which has been documented as far back as 1895 in Natal Province.[53] Also, some African countries, for example Egypt and Ethiopia, have regular weekly and special periods of religious fasting requiring observance of a vegetarian diet.[51][54]\\r\\nIn China, consumption of meat is rapidly increasing while a small but growing number of young people in large cities are vegan.[10] An estimated 4 to 5 percent of Chinese are vegetarian.[10] However, in a survey conducted by SJTU researchers, only 0.77 percent of respondents labeled themselves vegetarian.\\r\\nNative Chinese, generally falling under the label of Taoism (though this tends to confuse the native religion with the Daoist school of philosophy, represented by Laotzu, Chuangtzu, and others), is a form of animism. Similar to Shintoism in Japan, though the killing and eating of animals is not forbidden, it is considered impure.\\r\\nClassical Chinese texts pointed to a period of abstinence from meat before undertaking matters of great importance or of religious significance.\\r\\nWith the influx of Buddhist influences, vegetarianism became more popular, but there is a distinctionDaoist vegetarianism is based on a perception of purity, while Buddhist vegetarianism is based on the dual bases of refraining from killing and subduing one's own subservience to the senses. Because of this, two types of \\"vegetarianism\\" came to beone where one refrained from eating meat, the other being refraining from eating meat as well as garlic, onions, and other such strongly flavored foods. This Buddhism-influenced vegetarianism has been known and practiced by some since at least the 7th century.\\r\\nThe early 20th century saw some intellectuals espousing vegetarianism as part of their program for reforming China culturally, not just politically. The anarchist thinker Li Shizeng, for instance, argued that tofu and soy products were healthier and could be a profitable export. Liang Shuming, a philosopher and reform activist, adopted a basically vegetarian diet, but did not promote one for others. In recent years, it has seen a resurgence in the cities among the emerging middle class.[55]\\r\\nIn 2007, UN FAO statistics indicated that Indians had the lowest rate of meat consumption in the world.[56] India has more vegetarians than the rest of the world put together.[57] In India, vegetarianism is usually synonymous with lacto vegetarianism. Most restaurants in India clearly distinguish and market themselves as being either \\"non-vegetarian\\", \\"vegetarian\\", or \\"pure vegetarian\\". Vegetarian restaurants abound, and many vegetarian options are usually available. Animal-based ingredients (other than milk and honey) such as lard, gelatin, and meat stock are not used in the traditional cuisine. India has devised a system of marking edible products made from only vegetarian ingredients, with a green dot in a green square. A mark of a brown dot in a brown square conveys that some animal-based ingredients were used. Products like honey, milk, or its direct derivatives are often categorized under the green mark.[58]\\r\\nAccording to the 2006 Hindu-CNN-IBN State of the Nation Survey, 31% of Indians are vegetarian, while another 9% also consume eggs (ovo-vegetarian).[59] Among the various communities, vegetarianism was most common among the Lingayat, Vaishnav Community, Jain community and then Brahmins at 55%, and less frequent among Muslims (3%) and residents of coastal states. Other surveys cited by FAO[60] and USDA[61][62] estimate 40% of the Indian population as being vegetarian. These surveys indicate that even Indians who do eat meat, do so infrequently, with less than 30% consuming it regularly, although the reasons are mainly cultural.[62] In states where vegetarianism is more common, milk consumption is higher and is associated with lactase persistence. This allows people to continue consuming milk into adulthood and obtain proteins that are substituted for meat, fish and eggs in other areas.[63][64] An official survey conducted by the Government of India, with a sample size of 8858 and the census frame as 2011, indicated India's vegetarian population to be 28-29% of the total population.[65] Compared to a similar survey done almost a decade earlier, India's vegetarian population has increased.[66]\\r\\nAccording to a survey 2014 released by the registrar general of India, 29% of Indians over the age of 15 are vegetarian, compared with 25% in 2004.[67] Rajasthan has the highest fraction of vegetarians: 74.9%. Other states with large fraction of vegetarians are Haryana (69.25%) Punjab, (66.75%), Gujarat (60.95%) and MP (50.6%). Bengal (1.4%) and Telangana (1.3%) have the fewest vegetarians.\\r\\nThe recent growth in India's organized retail sector has also been hit by some controversy, because some vegetarians are demanding meat-free supermarkets.[68]\\r\\nIn 2016, the Government of India announced the decision to provide students, at a few of the Institutes of Hotel Management, Catering Technology and Applied Nutrition (IHMCTANs), the option to choose only vegetarian cooking. Earlier, it was compulsory for all IHMCTAN students to learn non-vegetarian cooking. These IHMCTANs are located at Ahmedabad, Bhopal and Jaipur.[69][70]\\r\\nIn 2018, a study from Economic and Political Weekly shows that in facts the percentage of vegetarians could be around 20?%, because people declarations in governemental surveys are different than the reality of meat consumption in the country.[71]\\r\\nA study by the Israeli Ministry of Health in 2001 found that 7.2% of men and 9.8% of women were vegetarian. Although vegetarianism is quite common, the actual percentage of vegetarians in Israel may be lower  the Israeli food industry estimated it at 5%.[72] In 2010, one study found that 2.6% of Israelis were vegetarians or vegans.[73]\\r\\nAccording to a 2015 poll by the newspaper ''Globe'' and Channel 2, 8% of the Israeli population were vegetarians and 5% were vegans. 13% consider turning vegan or vegetarian. Tel Aviv beat out Berlin, New York and Chennai, India as U.S. food website The Daily Meal's top destination for vegan travelers.[73][74]\\r\\nAccording to a 2014/12 survey 4.7% of the Japanese population are vegetarian or vegan (2.7% vegan). NOTE: The referenced web survey included 1,188 valid responses and is not representative of the population of Japan.[25]\\r\\nVegetarian diets are categorized as lacto vegetarianism, ovo-lacto vegetarianism, and veganism in general. The reasons for being vegetarian include influence from friends and family members, concern about global warming, health issues and weight management, religion and mercy for animals, in descending order of significance.[75]\\r\\nRice, mushrooms, vegetables are some of the dietary staples, mixed with a rich variety of spices, coconut, lime and tamarind. Buddhist Chinese monastics are vegetarians or vegans. Singapore is also the headquarters of the world's first international, vegetarian, fast food chain, VeganBurg.[76] The bigger communities of vegetarians and vegans in Singapore are Vegetarian Society (VSS) and SgVeganCommunity. Vegetarian and vegan places have an active role in the gastronomy of Singapore.\\r\\nIn Taiwan, 1.7 million people, or 13% of the population of Taiwan, follow a vegetarian diet at least some of the time.[77][78] There are more than 6,000 vegetarian eating establishments in Taiwan.[79] The country's food labelling laws for vegetarian food are the world's strictest, because around 2 million Taiwanese people eat vegetarian food.[80] A popular movement of \\"one day vegetarian every week\\" has been advocated on a national level,[81] and on a local level, even government bodies are involved, such as the Taipei City Board of Education.[82]\\r\\nThe definition of vegetarianism throughout Europe is not uniform, creating the potential for products to be labelled inaccurately.[1]\\r\\nAccording to a study of ISEF[83] from 2013 (n=500), 9% of Austrians are vegetarian or vegan.\\r\\nSince May 2009, Belgium has had the first city in the world (Ghent) with a weekly \\"veggie day\\".[84]\\r\\nAccording to a survey by Coop Analyse published in June 2011, just under 4% of Danes considered themselves either vegetarians or vegans.[11]\\r\\nThere is no recent data about amount of vegetarians or vegans in Finland. In 2015, according to a survey by meat producers' association Lihatiedotusyhdistys, 6% of the population, or 329,000 people, did not eat meat.[13] In 2014, the percentage was 5%; it was 10% among 25ÿ34 year old people. The survey did not ask about eating fish.[85] Otherwise, it is estimated that 2ÿ3% of Finns are vegetarians[12] and 0.5% vegans.[14] By combining the data of three surveys (a sample of 24,000 people) published in 2008, 3.3% of Finns identified themselves vegetarians but only 0.66% actually followed a vegetarian diet. 1.4% ate fish but not meat. 0.18% were vegans or lacto-vegetarians.[86]\\r\\nIn most of the cities's schools the students are offered two options, a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian meal, on four school days a week, and one day a week they have a choice between two vegetarian meals, for grades 1 to 12. In secondary schools and universities, from 10 to 40 percents of the students preferred vegetarian food in 2013.[87][88] Vegetarianism is most popular in secondary art schools where in some schools over half of the students were vegetarians in 2013.[89]\\r\\nStudies in the 1990s showed that one million French (1.5% of the total population) called themselves vegetarians, although more recently this number has reportedly increased to 2%.[15]\\r\\nAccording to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Germany has over six million vegetarians.[90] A survey conducted by Institut Produkt und Markt found that 9% of the population (7,380,000 people) are vegetarian.[91]\\r\\nHowever, the statistically representative German National Nutrition Monitoring (NEMONIT) only found there to be slightly less than 2% vegetarians in the German population in 2012.[92]\\r\\nThe Italian research institute Eurispes estimates that 10% of Italians are vegetarian and 1.1% are vegan.[18]\\r\\nIt is estimated that 4.5% of the Dutch population does not eat meat.[93]\\r\\nA study has shown that the number of vegetarians out of a population of nearly 16.5 million people increased from 560,000 in 2004 to 720,000 in 2006.[94][95] The number of \\"part-time vegetarians\\" grew rapidly as well; around 3.5 million Dutch citizens abstain from eating meat a few days a week.[95]\\r\\nThe sales of meat substitutes have an annual growth of around 25%, making it one of the fastest-growing markets in the Netherlands.[95] In supermarkets and stores, it is sometimes necessary to read the fine print on products in order to make sure that there are no animal-originated ingredients. Increasingly, however, vegetarian products are labeled with the international \\"V-label,\\" overseen by the Dutch vegetarian association Vegetarisch Keurmerk.[96] Veganism is uncommon in the Netherlands: the Dutch Association for Veganism estimates that there are approximately 70,000 vegans in the Netherlands, or around 0.4% of the population.[97]\\r\\nAccording to a survey carried out in Poland by Mintel in 2017, 8% of respondents are vegetarian, while 7% identify themselves as vegans.[98]\\r\\nThe capital of Poland, Warsaw, was listed 3rd on the list of Top Vegan Cities In The World published by HappyCow in 2017.[99]\\r\\nIn 2007, the number of vegetarians in Portugal was estimated at 30,000, which equates to less than 0.3% of the population. In 2014, the number was estimated to be 200,000 people.[100]\\r\\nVegan and vegetarian products like soy milk, soy yogurts, rice milk and tofu are widely available in major retailers, and across the country.\\r\\n2013-2014 polls revealed that 3[33] to 4%[34] of the Russian population considered themselves vegetarian.[101]\\r\\nA 2012 article in El Pais stated that 0.5% of the population are vegetarian, but that interest in vegetarianism is growing.[102]\\r\\nIn Spain, different sources estimate that there are between 1.5 and 2 million vegetarians. In a 2002 article El Mundo stated that there are 1.5 million vegetarians.[103] More recent sources (Asociaci܇n Vegana) estimate the number to be two million and observe that in recent years the number of people adopting a vegetarian diet has been growing.[104][105] According to a new study, the number of vegans in Spain increased to 3.5 millions in 2017. [106]\\r\\nA 2014 survey of 1,000 people found that the number of vegetarians had increased to 10% (4% vegans and 6% vegetarians).[37] The same survey found that 17% in the age group 15-24 were vegetarians.\\r\\n1997 government figures suggested that 2.3% of the population never ate meat, and the observed trend seemed to point towards less meat consumption.[107] A 2007 study suggested that the percentage of vegetarians had risen to 5%.[107]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, increasing numbers of people have adopted a vegetarian diet since the end of World War II.[108] The Food Standards Agency Public Attitudes to Food Survey 2009 reported that 3% of respondents were found to be \\"completely vegetarian\\", with an additional 5% \\"partly vegetarian (do not eat some types of fish or meat)\\".[40] The UK's National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) reported in 2014 that its four-year study found 2.6% of adults and 1.9% of children were vegetarian.[41] The \\"How many vegans?\\" survey conducted in May 2016 by the Vegan Society found that 3.25% of UK residents were vegetarian or vegan, while 1.05% were vegan.[42] Some less formal market studies suggest that vegetarians constitute 7% to 11% of the UK adult population (4 million people).[109][110][111] There are twice as many vegetarian women as men.[111] According to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the UK has the third highest rate of vegetarianism in the European Union.[90] Flexitarianism is also becoming more popular in the UK.[112]\\r\\nDespite the clear classification by the Vegetarian Society, some people in the UK misidentify as vegetarians while still eating fish, either for perceived \\"health reasons\\", or because of differing ethical perspectives on vegetarianism, while others use the terms \\"flexitarian\\" or \\"part-vegetarian\\".[108] As of 2009, people in the UK are now also identified with the labels \\"meat-avoiders\\" and \\"meat-reducers\\" by marketers, denoting people who do not self-identify as vegetarians, but are reducing or avoiding meat for reasons of health or climate change impacts, with one survey identifying 23% of the population as \\"meat-reducers\\", and 10% as \\"meat-avoiders\\", although the same survey indicated the \\"vast majority\\" in the UK still eat meat, with one in five liking to eat meat every day.[108]\\r\\nFoods labelled as suitable for vegetarians or vegans are subject to provisions within the Trades Descriptions Act 1968.[113] The Food Standards Agency issues guidance on the labelling of foods as suitable for vegetarians:\\r\\nThe term 'vegetarian' should not be applied to foods that are, or are made from or with the aid of, products derived from animals that have died, have been slaughtered, or animals that die as a result of being eaten. Animals means farmed, wild or domestic animals, including for example, livestock poultry, game, fish, shellfish, crustaceans, amphibians, tunicates, echinoderms, molluscs, and insects.\\r\\nThe FSA's definition has now passed into European law, with legislation due in 2015[needs update].\\r\\nIn addition to voluntary labelling, the Vegetarian Society operates a scheme whereby foods that meet its criteria can be labelled \\"Vegetarian Society approved\\".[115] Under this scheme, a product is vegetarian if it is free of meat, fowl, fish, shellfish, meat or bone stock, animal or carcass fats, gelatin, aspic, or any other ingredient resulting from slaughter, such as rennet.[116] Cheese is often labelled as well, making it possible to identify cheeses that have been made with rennet derived from non-animal sources.[117]\\r\\nIn Canada, vegetarianism is usually synonymous with ovo-lacto vegetarianism. However, vegetarians are sometimes wrongly assumed to be pescetarians or pollotarians. Approximately 4.0% of adults were vegetarians as of 2003[update].[118]\\r\\nIn 1971, 1 percent of U.S. citizens described themselves as vegetarians.[119] In 2008 Harris Interactive found that 3.2% are vegetarian and 0.5% vegan,[120] while a 2013 Public Policy Polling survey of 500 respondents found that 13% of Americans are either vegetarian or vegan6% vegetarian and 7% vegan.[121] U.S. vegetarian food sales (dairy replacements such as soy milk and meat replacements such as textured vegetable protein) doubled between 1998 and 2003, reaching $1.6 billion in 2003.[122] According to a report in 2017, the number of consumers claiming to be vegan has risen to 6% in the US [123] In 2015, a Harris Poll National Survey of 2,017 adults aged 18 and over found that eight million Americans, or 3.4%, ate a solely vegetarian diet, and that one million, or 0.4%, ate a strictly vegan diet.[43]\\r\\nMany American children whose parents follow vegetarian diets follow them because of religious, environmental or other reasons.[124] In the government's first estimate[125] of how many children avoid meat, the number is about 1 in 200.[126][127] The CDC survey included children ages 0 to 17 years.\\r\\nBy U.S. law, food packaging is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and generally must be labeled with a list of all its ingredients.[128][129] However, there are exceptions. For example, certain trace ingredients that are \\"ingredients of ingredients\\" do not need to be listed.[130]\\r\\nIn Australia, some manufacturers who target the vegetarian market label their foods with the statement \\"suitable for vegetarians\\"; however, for foods intended for export to the UK, this labelling can be inconsistent because flavourings in ingredients lists do not need to specify if they come from animal origin. As such, \\"natural flavour\\" could be derived from either plant or animal sources.\\r\\nAnimal rights organisations such as Animal Liberation promote vegan and vegetarian diets. \\"Vegetarian Week\\" runs from 1ÿ7 October every year,[131] and food companies are taking advantage of the growing number of vegetarians by producing meat-free alternatives of popular dishes, including sausages and mash and spaghetti Bolognese.[132]\\r\\nA 2000 Newspoll survey (commissioned by Sanitarium) shows 44% of Australians report eating at least one meat-free evening meal a week, while 18% said they prefer plant-based meals.\\r\\nAccording to a 2010 Newspoll survey, 5% of Australians identify themselves as vegetarians, with 2% actually eating a diet defined by the survey as vegetarian.[133]\\r\\nRoy Morgan Research in August 2016 reported, \\"Between 2012 and 2016, the number of Australian adults whose diet is all or almost all vegetarian has risen from 1.7 million people (or 9.7% of the population) to almost 2.1 million (11.2%), the latest findings from Roy Morgan Research reveal.\\"[134]\\r\\nSimilar to Australia, in New Zealand the term \\"vegetarian\\" refers to individuals who eat no animal meat such as pork, chicken, and fish; they may consume animal products such as milk and eggs. In contrast, the term \\"vegan\\" is used to describe those who do not eat or use any by-products of animals.[135] In 2002 New Zealand's vegetarians made up a minority of 1-2% of the countrys 4.5 million people.[136] By 2011 Roy Morgan Research claimed the number of New Zealanders eating an \\"all or almost all\\" vegetarian diet to be 8.1%, growing to 10.3% in 2015 (with men providing the most growth, up 63% from 5.7% to 9.3%).[29] In New Zealand there is a strong enough movement for vegetarianism that it has created significant enough demand for a number of vegetarian and vegan retailers to set up.[137]\\r\\nAs New Zealand and Australia work together to form common food standards (as seen in the Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) and the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code), there is also a lot of ambiguity surrounding the \\"natural flavour\\" ingredients.[138]\\r\\nIn 2004, Marly Winckler, President of the Brazilian Vegetarian Society, claimed that 5% of the population was vegetarian.[139] According to a 2012 survey undertaken by the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics, 8% of the population, or 15.2 million people, identified themselves as vegetarian.[6] The city of S?o Paulo has the most vegetarians in absolute terms (792,120 people), while Fortaleza has the highest percentage, at 14% of the total population.[140]\\r\\nMarly Winckler claims that the central reasons for the deforestation of the Amazon are expansive livestock raising (mainly cattle) and soybean crops, most of it for use as animal feed, and a minor percentage for edible oil processing (being direct human consumption for use as food nearly negligible),[141] claims that are widely known to have a basis.[142][143][144][145]\\r\\nAs in Canada, vegetarianismo (Portuguese pronunciation:?[ve?i?ta?j???nizmu]) is usually synonymous with lacto-ovo-vegetarianism, and vegetarians are sometimes wrongly assumed to be pescetarians and/or pollotarians who tolerate the flesh of fish or poultry, respectively. Nevertheless, veganism, and freeganism, are very common among Brazilian anarchists, punks and members of other groups in the counterculture and/or left-wing movements. Other beliefs generally associated with Brazilian vegetarians are Eastern philosophies and religions, New Age and Spiritism. It is also commonly said to be related to the emo and indie youth subcultures as influence from the local punks. Brazilian vegetarians reportedly tend to be urban, of middle or upper class[139] and live in the Central-Southern half of the country. Since the 1990s, and especially since the 2000s, several vegetarian and vegan restaurants have appeared in many cities like S?o Paulo, Braslia, Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Recife, Florian܇polis, Campinas, Jo?o Pessoa, Caxias do Sul, Salvador, Sorocaba, Santo Andr, Fortaleza, S?o Caetano do Sul and Ubatuba.[146]","input":"How much percentage of the world is vegetarian?"},{"output":"Newport News, Virginia","context":"USS West Virginia (BB-48), a Colorado-class battleship, was the second United States Navy ship named in honor of the country's 35th state. She was laid down on 12 April 1920 at Newport News, Virginia, launched on 19 November 1921 and commissioned on 1 December 1923. Her first captain was Thomas J. Senn. After her shakedown and crew training were finished, she was overhauled at Hampton Roads and later ran aground in Lynnhaven Channel.\\r\\nAfter her repairs she participated in exercises and engineering and gunnery courses, winning four medals in the latter. She participated in other fleet tactical development operations until 1939. In 1940 she was transferred to Pearl Harbor to guard against potential Japanese attack, and was sunk by six torpedoes and two bombs during the attack on Pearl Harbor. On 17 May 1942, she was salvaged from the seabed by draining the water from her hull.\\r\\nAfter repairs in Pearl Harbor, she sailed to the Puget Sound Navy Yard. There she received an extensive refit, including the replacement of her 5-inch (127?mm)/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns and single-purpose 5-inch (127?mm)/51 caliber guns with 5-inch (127?mm)/38 caliber anti-aircraft guns. She left Puget Sound in July 1944 for Leyte Gulf.\\r\\nShe bombarded Leyte in November 1944, becoming part of a successful American plan to destroy the portion of the Japanese fleet trying to sail through the Surigao Strait, and later attacked Iwo Jima and Okinawa. At the end of the Pacific War she entered Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender and became part of Operation Magic Carpet, making three runs to Hawaii to transport veterans home. She was deactivated on 9 January 1947 and laid up at Bremerton, Washington, until sold for scrap on 24 August 1959.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWest Virginia was 624 feet (190?m) long overall, had a beam of 97.3?ft (29.7?m) (114?ft (35?m) after her rebuild) and a draft of 30.5?ft (9.3?m). She displaced 32,100 long tons (32,600?t) as designed, and up to 33,060 long tons (33,590?t) at full load. The ship was powered by a four-shaft turbo-electric drive rated at 28,900 shaft horsepower (21,600?kW) and eight Babcock & Wilcox boilers, generating a top speed of 21 knots (39?km/h; 24?mph). She had a range of 8,000 nautical miles (9,200?mi) at 10 knots (19?km/h; 12?mph) and a crew of 1,407?officers and enlisted men when commissioned.[1]\\r\\nShe was armed with a main battery of eight 16-inch (406?mm)/45 caliber Mark 1 guns in four twin gun turrets on the centerline, two forward and two aft. The secondary battery consisted of sixteen 5-inch (127?mm)/51 caliber guns. The anti-aircraft defense consisted of four 3-inch (76?mm)/23 caliber guns, which were soon replaced with four 5-inch/25 caliber guns. The secondary battery of 5-inch/51 caliber guns and the anti-aircraft battery of 5-inch/25 caliber guns were replaced with 5-inch/38 caliber guns. Standard for capital ships of the period, she carried two 21-inch (530?mm) torpedo tubes in deck-mounted torpedo launchers which were removed in a later overhaul.[1] A CXAM-1 Radar was installed in 1940.[2]\\r\\nWest Virginia's main armored belt was 13.5 inches (343?mm) thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces, and 8 inches (203?mm) elsewhere. The main-battery gun turrets had 18-inch-thick (460?mm) faces, and the supporting barbettes had 13 inches (330?mm) of armor plating on their exposed sides. Armor 3.5 inches (89?mm) thick protected the decks, and the conning tower had 11.5-inch-thick (290?mm) sides.[1]\\r\\nWest Virginia's keel was laid down at Newport News, Virginia on 12 April 1920 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. She was launched on 19 November 1921 and commissioned on 1 December 1923. Her first captain was Thomas J. Senn, while her construction was sponsored by Alice Wright Mann, daughter of Isaac T. Mann, a noted West Virginian. [3][4]\\r\\nAs she was one of the newest American super-dreadnoughts, she incorporated the latest features in naval design. Several different features from American battleships planned before the Battle of Jutland included a watertight, compartmentalized hull and the thickness of her armor.[3]\\r\\nAfter her trials, shakedown and post-commission repairs, she departed Newport News for New York harbor for work purposes. After a brief amount of work at the New York Navy Yard, she departed the harbor for Hampton Roads for repairs. Along the way, she experienced steering gear troubles. When her overhaul was completed, she departed Hampton on the morning of 16 June 1924.[5][6]\\r\\nAt 10:10 am, while she was sailing down the center of Lynnhaven Channel, the quartermaster reported that the rudder indicator and emergency bell to the steering engine room were unresponsive. Captain Senn quickly ordered all engines stopped, but the engine-room telegraph would not respond to messages; there was no power to the engine-room or steering telegraphs.[5][6]\\r\\nUsing the voice tube from the bridge to main control, Senn ordered full power on the port engine and stopped the starboard. The crew tried to steer the ship with her engines and keep her in the channel and, when this failed, to keep her away from the edge of the channel. Their efforts were fruitless; the ship lost headway due to engine failure, and she ran aground on the soft mud bottom. In its investigation of the grounding, the court of inquiry found that \\"inaccurate and misleading navigational data\\" had been supplied to the ship; the chart legend indicated greater channel width than actually existed, and Senn and the navigator were exonerated. After she was repaired, West Virginia became the battle-fleet flagship on 30 October 1924.[6][7] The ship won the American Defense Society's American Defense Cup and the Spokane Cup, presented by the city's Chamber of Commerce in recognition of her excellence in short-range firing, in addition to Battle Efficiency Pennants in 1925, 1927, 1932 and 1935.[6][8]\\r\\nDuring this period she underwent a cycle of training, maintenance and readiness exercises, participating in engineering and gunnery competitions and the annual fleet problems. In the latter, the fleet would be divided into opposing sides; a strategic or tactical situation would be implemented, with the lessons learned becoming part of a doctrine later tested in combat. As part of Fleet Problem V in 1925, she participated in an \\"attack\\" on the Hawaiian Islands to test its coastal defenses. The year after, she participated with the Battle fleet in a voyage to Australia and New Zealand. In later exercises, she sailed from Hawaii to first the Caribbean and then the Atlantic. She also made a voyage from Alaska to Panama.[6][9] In Fleet Problem XI, she and the battleship Tennessee accidentally fired several rounds at the aircraft carrier Saratoga, mistaking her for Lexington.[10]\\r\\nShe received performance-enhancing modifications, including the replacement of her original 3-inch (76?mm)/23 caliber anti-aircraft battery with 5-inch (130?mm)/25 calibler guns in 1927ÿ28; the addition of platforms for half-inch (12.7?mm) machine guns at the foremast and maintop, and the addition of catapults to her quarterdeck, aft and number-three (high) turret. West Virginia was one of 14 ships to receive early RCA CXAM-1 radar.[2] During the late 1930s it became evident that it was only a matter of time before the United States became involved in another large-scale war, and the fleet was dispatched to the Pacific in the spring of 1939 and stationed in Hawaii in 1940 after Fleet Problem XXI as a Japanese deterrent.[6][11]\\r\\nDuring 1941 West Virginia carried out intensive training from Pearl Harbor as part of a number of task forces and groups around Hawaii, with an unusually tense period beginning in late November and continuing into December. Training was usually followed by in-port upkeep along southeastern Ford Island.[2][6][11]\\r\\nOn Sunday, 7 December 1941, West Virginia was moored outboard from Tennessee at berth F-6 with 40?ft (12?m) of water beneath her keel. Shortly before 8:00 am, Japanese planes from a six-carrier task force began an attack on Pearl Harbor. Seven Japanese Type 91 aerial torpedoes struck the port side of West Virginia. One hit the steering gear, dislodging the rudder. At least three struck below the armor belt, with one or more striking the belt itself (requiring the replacement of seven armor plates).[12] One or two torpedoes exploded on the armored second deck after entering the listing ship through holes made by previous torpedoes. One torpedo failed to detonate, and was recovered and disarmed by shipyard explosive technicians. The torpedo attack made two large holes, extending from frames 43 to 52 and 62 to 97.[13][14]\\r\\nWest Virginia was also damaged by two Type 99 No. 80 Mk 5 bombs made from 16?in (410?mm) armor-piercing naval shells fitted with aerial fins. The first was found, unexploded, in debris on the second deck after passing through the searchlight platform, signal bridge and main deck deck near frame 70. The second bomb penetrated the 4-inch (100?mm) roof of turret three and broke apart destroying one of the turret's two guns, but did not detonate. It destroyed the Vought OS2U Kingfisher floatplane on the turret catapult. The impact knocked a second floatplane upside down to the main deck below, spilling gasoline (which ignited) from its fuel tanks. Burning aircraft fuel injured turret personnel and damaged the remaining gun. West Virginia was eventually engulfed by an oil-fed conflagration, begun by the burning Arizona and sustained for 30 hours by fuel leaking from both ships.[15]\\r\\nPort-side torpedo damage caused rapid compartment flooding; prompt counter-flooding by four damage-control parties under the command of Lt. Commander John S. Harper and early closure of all water-tight doors and hatches ordered by Harper's assistant, Archie P. Kelley, prevented the ship from capsizing. Water damage ruined much of the ship's communications gear, including its battle-phone batteries. An experimental sound-powered telephone circuit connecting the central station with the damage-control parties, tested during the previous summer's damage-control drills, remained operative but was unused. Captain Mervyn S. Bennion,[A] unaware that Harper and Kelly had begun damage-control efforts, ordered Lieutenant C. V. Ricketts to begin counter-flooding the starboard compartments. Ricketts, delayed at his battle station and AA-gun batteries, arrived to find 30 to 40 starboard compartments already flooded. In his report, Ricketts wrote that he witnessed the flooding of one compartment. He then ordered all remaining starboard compartments flooded and returned to the bridge to help move the captain, mortally wounded by shrapnel. Harper's report on the counter-flooding of \\"all available voids\\", as directed, indicated that Ricketts' assistance had been unnecessary.[17]\\r\\nDuring the attack's first wave and the counter-flooding overseen by Harper, executive officer Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter abandoned ship by jumping off the starboard quarterdeck. Harper was then notified by an officer on the conning tower that the captain was dying, the executive officer had abandoned ship and Harper (as third in command) was now the commanding officer. After confirming that all starboard compartments were flooded, Harper went to the conning tower. Countermanding the captain's dying order for all hands to abandon ship, he ordered repair parties to fight fires fore and aft. Fire hoses from Tennessee were passed to West Virginia; crews fought fires near turret three and elsewhere on the ship until about 2:00 pm, when Harper ordered the remaining crew to abandon ship.[18]\\r\\nWith a patch over the damaged area of her hull the battleship was pumped out, refloated on 17 May 1942 and docked in Drydock Number One on 9 June. This enabled a more detailed damage assessment, indicating six (not five) torpedo hits.[19][20]\\r\\nDuring repairs, workers found the bodies of 66 West Virginia sailors who were trapped below when the ship sank.[21][19] Several were lying atop steam pipes, in the only remaining air bubble of flooded areas. Three were found in a storeroom compartment, where they had survived for a time on emergency rations and fresh water from a battle station;[21] a calendar indicated that they were alive through 23 December.[22] Although the remaining crew and shipyard workers were confronted with a monumental task because of the damage to her port side, West Virginia sailed from Pearl Harbor on 7 May 1943 to Bremerton, Washington and a complete rebuild at the Puget Sound Navy Yard.[19]\\r\\nThe hyperboloid cage masts supporting the three-tier fire-control tops, the two funnels, the open-mount 5-inch (127?mm)/25 caliber guns and the casemates with the single-purpose 5-inch/51 caliber guns were replaced by a single funnel and dual-purpose 5-inch/38 caliber guns. On the decks, 40?mm Bofors and 20?mm Oerlikon batteries were added.[6][19] Although the two-ocean naval policy dictated a beam limit of 108 feet (33?m) for U.S. battleships to traverse the Panama Canal, when Tennessee, California and West Virginia were rebuilt their beams were widened to 114 feet (35?m) feet, effectively limiting their service to the Pacific theater.[6][19] After her rebuild her appearance differed from her sister ship, Maryland, while resembling that of Tennessee and California except for her twin-gun main battery turrets.[6][19]\\r\\nBy early July 1944, West Virginia had been fully modernized, she sailed to Port Townsend, Washington, finishing trials on 12 July. She returned to Puget Sound for final repairs, before heading for her post-modernization shakedown at San Pedro, California.[6][19]\\r\\nShe completed her shakedown and departed for Pearl Harbor on 14 September.[19] She was escorted by two destroyers and arrived there on 23 September. She then sailed for Manus Island, being joined by the fleet carrier Hancock. Twelve days later, when she arrived in Seeadler Harbor she became part of Battleship Division 4. Another two days later, she became the flagship of Battleship Division 4 after Admiral Theodore Ruddock moved his flag from Maryland to West Virginia.[6][23]\\r\\nParticipating in the invasion of the Philippines, West Virginia sailed as part of Task Group 77.2 (TG 77.2) under Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf. On 18 October the battle line entered Leyte Gulf, with West Virginia behind California. At 4:45 pm, California dislodged a naval mine with her paravane; West Virginia avoided it, and it was destroyed a few moments later by gunfire from a destroyer in the screen.[6][24][25]\\r\\nThe next day West Virginia steamed to her assigned station in San Pedro Bay at 7:00 am to stand by and bombard shore targets in Tacloban, Leyte's capital. Retiring to sea that evening, the battleship and her consorts returned the next morning to attack Japanese installations in the Tacloban area.[6][24] Her gunners fired 278 16-inch (410?mm) and 1,586 5-inch (130?mm) shells, silencing the Japanese artillery and supporting the underwater demolition teams (UDTs) preparing the beaches for the 20 October assault. During the assault, Japanese planes flew over the landing area; West Virginia fired at those within range, but did not down any.[6][26]\\r\\nOn 21 October, as she sailed to her support position for the landing troops, the battleship touched the seabottom and sustained slight damage to three of her four propellers. Vibration from the damaged blades limited sustained speeds to 16?kn (18?mph; 30?km/h), or 18?kn (21?mph; 33?km/h) in emergencies. For the next two days, she continued providing anti-aircraft fire for the invasion troops. She was situated close to the beachhead during the day and retreating seaward at night.[6][27]\\r\\nPart of the Japanese fleet, four carriers and two hybrid battleship-carriers (Ise and Hyga), sailed toward the Philippine Sea. A small surface force under Admiral Kiyohide Shima headed for the Sulu Sea; two striking forces consisting of battleships, cruisers and destroyers left Lingga Roads, Sumatra, before separating north of Borneo. The larger group, commanded by Admiral Takeo Kurita, passed north of the island of Palawan to cross the Sibuyan Sea.[28]\\r\\nThe smaller force, under Admiral Shoji Nishimura, turned south of Palawan and crossed the Sulu Sea to pass between the islands of Mindanao and Leyte. Shima's force followed Nishimura's, heading for Leyte Gulf as the southern jaw of a pincer against the amphibious ships and transports unloading off the Leyte beachhead. When Nishimura advanced down the Surigao Strait, American PT boats sortied against his fleet.[28]\\r\\nWest Virginia, meanwhile, was leading a battle line of Maryland, Mississippi, Tennessee, California, and Pennsylvania. Since 12:21 am on 25 October, the battleship had received reports on the PT-boat and destroyer attacks; at 3:16 am, West Virginia's radar picked up Nishimura's force at a range of 42,000?yd (38,000?m) and reached a firing solution at 30,000?yd (27,000?m). After tracking the force, at 3:52 am West Virginia fired her eight 16-inch (406?mm) main-battery guns at a range of 22,800?yd (20,800?m) and struck the leading Japanese battleship with her first salvo. Five of her first six salvos struck Nishimura's ships; she fired a total of 16 salvos as Oldendorf crossed the T of the Japanese fleet, effectively destroying it. At 4:13 am, she ceased fire as the Japanese remnants fled back down the strait. Several burning Japanese ships blocked the strait, with West Virginia contributing to Yamashiro's sinking. On 29 October, she left the Philippines for Ulithi with Tennessee and Maryland. After Admiral Ruddock moved his flag from West Virginia back to Maryland, she headed for Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides for repairs.[28][29][30]\\r\\nWest Virginia returned to the Philippines on 26 November, resuming her patrols in Leyte Gulf as part of the antiaircraft screen for transports and amphibious ships. At 11:39 am on 27 November her antiaircraft guns shot down a kamikaze, and she assisted in downing others the next day.[6][31]\\r\\nRear Admiral Ruddock returned on 30 November and continued her operations off Leyte until 2 December, when the battleship headed for Palau. Flagship of a new task force, she proceeded toward the Sulu Sea to cover the landings on Mindoro.[32] Entering Leyte Gulf late in the evening of 12 December, she entered the Surigao Strait the next day and steamed into the Sulu Sea with a carrier force to provide cover for the transports. The battleship covered the retirement of the transports on 16 December, refueling in Leyte Gulf before returning to Kossol Roads (where she spent Christmas) at midday on 19 December.[6][31]\\r\\nAfter Christmas, West Virginia returned to the Philippines. On 1 January, Rear Admiral Ingram C. Sowell relieved Ruddock as commander of the battleship division and she sailed for Leyte Gulf as part of TG 77.2. Entering the gulf in the predawn hours of 3 January, West Virginia proceeded into the Sulu Sea. Japanese air opposition, which intensified since the early Philippine campaign, was deadlier. A kamikaze crashed into the escort carrier Ommaney Bay at 5:12 pm on 4 January; her crew abandoned ship because of multiple fires, and were picked up by other ships in the screen. The destroyer Burns scuttled the sinking escort carrier with several torpedoes.[6][31]\\r\\nTaking Ommaney Bay survivors from the destroyer Twiggs, West Virginia entered the South China Sea the next morning and defended the carriers from Japanese air attacks. The battleship moved inshore (with the carriers outside) to bombard San Fernando Point, hitting Japanese shore installations with her 16-inch (410?mm) guns. Kamikazes kept up their attacks despite heavy anti-aircraft fire and U.S. fighter planes, damaging HMAS?Australia and the battleships California and New Mexico on 5 December.[6][33]\\r\\nWest Virginia took another group of survivors on board: the crew of the high-speed minesweeper Hovey, sunk by a Japanese torpedo on 6 January. Her 16-inch (410?mm) guns again bombarded Japanese shore positions at San Fabian on 8ÿ9 January, as troops landed on 9 January. On the night of 9 January, the battleship finally transferred her passengers.[6][33]\\r\\nAfter providing fire support all day on 10 January, West Virginia patrolled off Lingayen Gulf for the next week before replenishing her ammunition. During her shore-bombardment tours off San Fabian, she covered Underwater Demolition Team operations, destroyed mortar positions, entrenchments and gun emplacements and leveled San Fabian, destroying ammunition dumps, railway and road junctions, machine-gun positions and warehouses. During that time, the ship fired 395 16-inch (410?mm) shells and over 2,800 5-inch (130?mm) projectiles. Underway again at 7:07 am on 21 January, West Virginia began fire-support duties at 8:15 in readiness for cooperation with United States Army units ashore in the vicinity of Rosario and Santo Tomas. After several more days of readiness for fire support, West Virginia anchored in Lingayen Gulf on 1 February.[6][33]\\r\\nAs part of TG 77.2, West Virginia protected shipping at the Lingayen beachheads and was ready to provide army fire support. She left Lingayen Gulf, her duty completed there, on 10 February for Leyte Gulf. Before her departure she received 79 bags of United States mail, the first she received since Christmas Eve.[6][33]\\r\\nAfter a stop at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, West Virginia arrived at Ulithi on 16 February for duty with the Fifth Fleet. The battleship quickly provisioned and refueled for another operation, loading about 300?tons (270?tonnes) of stores by 4:00 am on 17 February. At 7:30, she left for Iwo Jima with the destroyers Izard and McCall.[6][33]\\r\\nWest Virginia's crew sighted the island of Iwo Jima at a range of 82 miles (132?km) on the morning of 19 February. When the distance closed, she could see the first landings on the island, with ships surrounding the island, shelling the island from all sides. Later on the morning, she received orders from a dispatch boat and within a half-hour she reached her post.[6][33]\\r\\nBy midday, she began bombarding the island with 16-inch rounds. Her 16-inch shells caused collapsed caves and destroyed artillery batteries, tanks, vehicles, anti-aircraft emplacements, and blockhouses. One salvo struck an ammunition storage area, with its explosions lasting about two hours. Leaving on 20 February for ammunition. On the next day, she returned and continued her duties. That day the United States Marine Corps took Mount Suribachi, a prominent landmark on one end of the island. From their position offshore, West Virginia's crew could see the flag flying from the top.[6][33]\\r\\nFor the rest of the month, she continued her fire support and anti-aircraft cover for the troops ashore. Japanese positions were heavily bombarded by the fleet with most structures and troop concentrations being destroyed. On 27 February, during her daily fire support duties, her crew spotted a coastal artillery battery firing at the destroyer Bryant. She approached towards shore and opened fire with her 5-inch (130?mm)/38 guns at a range of 600?yd (550?m), destroying the gun battery.[6][34]\\r\\nThe next day, she departed for ammunition. By the afternoon, she was back in action. Over the following days, she continued her fire support duties, destroying outposts and pillboxes with her secondary battery firing air bursts, mainly off the northeastern shore. On 4 March, she departed the island for the Caroline Islands, reaching Ulithi two days later.[6][34]\\r\\nJoining TF 64 for the Battle of Okinawa, West Virginia departed on 21 March and reached her objective four days later. She spent the following days softening up Okinawa for the American landings, scheduled to begin on 1 April. In her first salvos of the operation, West Virginia shot 28 rounds of 16-inch (410?mm) gunfire against the Japanese batteries. Over the next few days kamikaze attacked the islands, and naval mines started to have an effect; one sank the minesweeper Skylark, 3,000?yd (2,700?m) off West Virginia's bow, at 9:30 am on 28 March.[6][35][36]\\r\\nAfter restocking ammunition at Kerema Retto, she bombarded Okinawa on 1 April in support of the troops advancing rapidly inland. That day a kamikaze flew over her port side before looping over and crash-diving into a superstructure deck, killing four men and wounding 23. The plane's bomb broke loose and penetrated to the second deck; it was confirmed a dud by technicians. Although portions of the ship were severely damaged, she reported the damage as \\"fixable\\" and carried on.[6][37]\\r\\nIn early April, the Japanese attempted to strike at the invasion fleet in a suicide mission with the super-battleship Yamato. On the night of 7ÿ8 April West Virginia sailed in the waters west of Okinawa, ready to intercept and engage the Japanese surface force headed her way. The next morning, the task force commander reported that Yamato had been sunk by U.S. aircraft.[6][37]\\r\\nAfter Yamato's sinking, West Virginia continued providing illumination and counter-battery fire with her main and secondary batteries; Zellars, Tennessee, Salt Lake City, Stanly and others were damaged or sunk by kamikaze. Her shelling support shifted from the Marines to the Army, continuing until 20 April. She then sailed to Ulithi, turning back after the battleship Colorado was damaged by a powder explosion at Kerema Retto. At the Hagushi beach, West Virginia provided cover fire for the XXIVth Army Corps and sailed to Ulithi with San Francisco and Hobson[6][37]\\r\\nReturning to Okinawa after brief repairs, she supported the Army and Marines until the end of June. On 1 June, she sent a spotting plane to locate an enemy blockhouse; several shots missed, but the next day she had four hits and seven misses on the blockhouse.[6][37]\\r\\nOff Okinawa's southeastern coast, she broke up Japanese troop concentrations, destroyed caves and disrupted Japanese road traffic. On 16 June, while she was supporting the 1st Marine Division, her spotter plane crashed in Japanese-held territory. When rescue attempts failed, she borrowed a Vought OS2U Kingfisher from Tennessee. At the end of June she passed San Pedro Bay, Leyte, reaching the Philippines on 1 July escorted by Connolly. On the morning of 5 July, she received her first replacement troops since 1944. After loading ammunition, she trained in the Philippines until the end of the month.[6][37]\\r\\nSailing on 3 August for Okinawa, West Virginia reached Buckner Bay on 6 Augustthe day Little Boy, the first atomic bomb, was dropped on the city of Hiroshima. At 9:15?pm on 10 August, West Virginia picked up a radio report that the Japanese government agreed to surrender under the terms of the Potsdam Declaration if its people could keep the Emperor of Japan as their ruler. Although the ships in the bay soon began celebrating, on 12 August Pennsylvania was torpedoed; West Virginia sent a whaleboat the next day with pumps for the damaged ship.[6][38]\\r\\nWest Virginia sailed for Tokyo Bay on 24 August as part of TG 35.90. Reaching the bay a week later, she was present for the formal surrender on 2 September 1945 and five musicians from her band were temporarily transferred to Missouri to play at the ceremonies.[6][38]\\r\\nWest Virginia remained in Tokyo Bay into September, and on 14 September she received 270 passengers for transport to the U.S. West Coast. She got underway at midnight on 20 September, bound for Okinawa as part of TG 30.4. Moving to Buckner Bay on 23 September, the battleship sailed for Pearl Harbor soon afterwards and reached her destination on 4 October. She was painted, and the only passengers remaining were bound for San Diego, California. Leaving for California on 9 October, West Virginia moored at the Navy Pier at San Diego at 1:28 pm on the 22nd. Two days later, Rear Admiral I. C. Sowell lowered his flag as Commander, Battleship Division 4.[38]\\r\\nOn Navy Day, 25,554 visitors boarded the ship. Three days later, on 30 October, she sailed for Hawaii as part of Operation Magic Carpet. After three runs between Pearl Harbor the West Coast, she reached San Pedro, California on 17 December and spent Christmas debarking her third load of passengers. She left San Pedro on 4 January 1946 for Bremerton, Washington, reaching her destination on the 12th and beginning inactivation. Four days later she moved to Seattle, Washington, where she was moored alongside her sister ship Colorado.[38]\\r\\nEntering her final stages of inactivation in late February 1946, she was decommissioned on 9 January 1947 and became part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She remained inactive until she was struck from the Naval Vessel Registry on 1 March 1959. On 24 August she was sold for scrapping to the Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation of New York City, then towed from Bremerton to the Vigor Shipyards and broken up.[38][39][40]\\r\\nAn anti-aircraft gun is at City Park in Parkersburg, West Virginia and the ship's wheel and binnacle are on display at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum.[38] To honor the sailors who died, the flagstaff that was sunk at Pearl Harbor is in Clarksburg, West Virginia, displayed in front of the Harrison County Courthouse. The mainmast of the ship sits in front of Oglebay Hall at West Virginia University, while the secondary con wheel was sent to Salem International University, Salem, West Virginia, where it is on display at the school's library.[41]\\r\\nIn 2000, governor Cecil Underwood issued a proclamation on the 59th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack naming Interstate 470 in West Virginia the USS West Virginia Memorial Highway.[42]","input":"Where is the uss west virginia battleship located?"},{"output":"Keynes","context":"","input":"Who is the founding father of keynesianism (last name)?"},{"output":"A simple majority vote","context":"The appointment and confirmation of Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States involves several steps set forth by the United States Constitution, which have been further refined and developed by decades of tradition. Candidates are nominated by the President of the United States and must face a series of hearings in which both the nominee and other witnesses make statements and answer questions before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which can vote to send the nomination to the full United States Senate. Confirmation by the Senate allows the President to formally appoint the candidate to the court.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle Two of the United States Constitution requires the President of the United States to nominate Supreme Court Justices and, with Senate confirmation, requires Justices to be appointed. This was for the division of power between the President and Senate by the founders, who wrote:\\r\\nhe shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint ... Judges of the supreme Court...\\r\\nUpon the election of a new President, incoming White House staff prepare profiles of possible candidates for the Supreme Court, considering not only judges but also politicians and other individuals whom they consider appropriate for the role. Besides considering national figures whose views are well-known, they consider others who are less recognized. They go through published rulings, articles, speeches, and other background material to get an idea of candidates' values and views on constitutional issues. Age, health, race, gender, and likelihood of confirmation are also factored into considerations. Once a Supreme Court vacancy opens, the President discusses the candidates with advisors. Senators also call the President with suggestions. After a first choice is decided, the candidate is contacted and called on by the President to serve on the highest court. Staffers send a vetting form for the candidate to fill out. They visit the candidate to go over tax records and payments to domestic help. Candidates whom the President has never met are interviewed by White House officials before being sent to the White House to be interviewed in person by the President. After making a final decision, the President calls the candidate, who is told to prepare a statement for an appearance in front of the national press for the President's formal announcement.\\r\\nMost Presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological views.[1] In many cases, however, a Justice's decisions may be contrary to what the nominating President anticipated. A famous instance was Chief Justice Earl Warren; President Dwight D. Eisenhower expected him to be a conservative judge, but his decisions are arguably among the most liberal in the Court's history. Eisenhower later called the appointment \\"the biggest damn fool mistake I ever made\\".[2] Another Justice whose decisions ran contrary to what was believed to be his ideology was David Souter, who was nominated to the high court in 1990 by President George H. W. Bush. Many pundits and politicians at the time expected Souter to be a conservative; however, after becoming a Justice, his opinions generally fell on the liberal side of the political spectrum.\\r\\nBecause the Constitution does not set any qualifications for service as a Justice, the President may nominate any individual to serve on the Court. However, that person must receive the confirmation of the Senate.\\r\\nIn modern times, the confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from special-interest groups, many of which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee, depending on whether the nominee's track record aligns with the group's views. The Senate Judiciary Committee conducts hearings, questioning nominees to determine their suitability. By convention, nominees avoid revealing too much about their views on potential cases that may come before the Court. At the close of confirmation hearings, the Committee votes on whether the nomination should go to the full Senate with a positive, negative or neutral report.\\r\\nThe Committee's practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent, beginning with Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925. Some western senators were concerned with his links to Wall Street and expressed their opposition when Stone was nominated. Stone proposed what was then the novelty of appearing before the Judiciary Committee to answer questions; his testimony helped secure a confirmation vote with very little opposition. The second nominee to appear before the Committee was Felix Frankfurter, who only addressed (at the Committee's request) what he considered to be slanderous allegations against him.[3] The modern practice of the Committee questioning nominees on their judicial views began with the nomination of John Marshall Harlan II in 1955; the nomination came shortly after the Court handed down the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, and several Southern senators attempted to block Harlan's confirmation, hence the decision to testify.[4][5]\\r\\nOnce the Committee reports out the nomination, the whole Senate considers it. A simple majority vote is required to confirm or to reject a nominee. Prior to 2017, a successful filibuster threat could add the requirement of a supermajority of 60 needed in favor of cloture, which would allow debate to end and force a final vote on confirmation. Rejections are relatively uncommon; the Senate has explicitly rejected twelve Supreme Court nominees in its history. The most recent rejection of a nominee by vote of the full Senate came in 1987, when the Senate refused to confirm Robert Bork.\\r\\nNot everyone nominated by the President has received a floor vote in the Senate. Prior to 2017 a nominee could be filibustered once debate on the nomination had begun in the full Senate. A filibuster indefinitely prolongs the debate, preventing a final vote on the nominee. President Lyndon Johnson's nomination of sitting Associate Justice Abe Fortas to succeed Earl Warren as Chief Justice in 1968 was the first successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. It included both Republican and Democratic senators concerned with Fortas's ethics. President Donald Trump's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the seat vacated by Antonin Scalia was the second. Unlike the Fortas filibuster, however, only Democratic Senators voted against cloture on the Gorsuch nomination, citing his perceived conservative judicial philosophy, and the Republican majority's prior refusal to take up Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy.[6][7][8] This led the Republican majority to change the rules and eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations.[9]\\r\\nNot every Supreme Court nominee has received a floor vote in the Senate. A president may withdraw a nomination before an actual confirmation vote occurs, typically because it is clear that the Senate will reject the nominee; this occurred most recently with the nomination of Harriet Miers in 2006 before Committee hearings had begun, citing concerns about Senate requests during her confirmation process for access to internal Executive Branch documents resulting from her position as White House Counsel. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan withdrew the nomination of Douglas H. Ginsburg because of news reports containing marijuana use allegations.\\r\\nThe Senate may also fail to act on the nomination, which expires at the end of the session. For example, President Dwight Eisenhower's first nomination of John Marshall Harlan II in November 1954 was not acted on by the Senate; Eisenhower re-nominated Harlan in January 1955, and Harlan was confirmed two months later. Most recently, the Senate failed to act on President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland in March 2016 to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia; the nomination expired in January 2017, and the vacancy was later filled by President Trump's appointment of Neil Gorsuch.[10]\\r\\nBefore 1981 the approval process of Justices was usually rapid. From the Truman through Nixon administrations, Justices were typically approved within one month. From the Reagan administration to the present, however, the process has taken much longer. According to the Congressional Research Service, the average number of days from nomination to final Senate vote since 1975 is 67 days (2.2 months), while the median is 71 days (or 2.3 months).[11][12] Some believe this is because Congress sees Justices as playing a more political role than in the past.[13] The perceived politicization of the process has drawn criticism. For example, columnist George F. Will termed the defeat of Robert Bork's nomination \\"unjust\\" and, more generally, that the nomination process does \\"not delve deeply into the nominee's jurisprudential thinking.\\"[14] Supreme Court nominations have caused media speculation about whether the judge leans to the left, middle, or right.[15] One indication of the politicized selection process is how much time each nominee spends being questioned under the glare of media coverage; before 1925, nominees were never questioned;[16] after 1955, every nominee has been required to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and answer questions; and the hours spent being grilled have lengthened from single digits (before 1980) to double digits today.[17] Another example of the politicization of the process was the Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination, which remained before the Senate far longer than any other nominee.\\r\\nFollowing is a table of the approximate number of hours that media sources estimate were spent on the questioning of Supreme Court nominees since 1925:\\r\\nOnce the Senate confirms the nomination by an affirmative vote, the Secretary of the Senate attests to a resolution of confirmation and transmits it to the White House.[18] The President then prepares and signs a commission, and causes the Seal of the United States Department of Justice to be affixed to the document before the new Justice can take office.[19] The date of commission determines a Justice's seniority.[20] A ceremony is held in which the Justice must take the Constitutional Oath, which is used for every federal and state officeholder below the President, and the Judicial Oath used for federal judges before entering into the execution of their office.\\r\\nArticle II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution provides that:\\r\\nThe President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\\r\\nThus, when the Senate is in recess, the President may make a temporary appointment to any office requiring Senate approval, including filling vacancies on the Supreme Court, without the Senate's advice and consent. Such a recess appointee to the Supreme Court holds office only until the end of the next Senate session (always less than two years). To continue to serve thereafter and be compensated for his or her service, the nominee must be formally nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Of the ten Justices who have received recess appointments - two Chief Justices and eight Associate Justices - only Chief Justice John Rutledge was not subsequently confirmed for a regular appointment. No president since Dwight Eisenhower (who made three such appointments) has made a recess appointment to the Supreme Court and the practice has become highly controversial even when applied to lower federal courts. During the 110th Congress, the Democratic leadership of the Senate specifically blocked Republican President George W. Bush from making any recess appointments with the use of pro forma sessions.\\r\\nIn 1960 the Senate passed a resolution stating that it was the sense of the Senate that recess appointments to the Supreme Court should not be made except under unusual circumstances.[21] Being a resolution, it has no legally binding effect, but was intended as an expression of the position of the Senate and as a guide to executive actions. The resolution passed by a vote of 48 to 37, mainly along party lines.[21] [22]\\r\\nFollowing is a list of recess appointments that have been made to the Supreme Court:[23]\\r\\nThe ability of a president to appoint new justices depends on the occurrence of a vacancy on the Court. The Constitution provides that justices \\"shall hold their offices during good behavior\\" (unless appointed during a Senate recess). The term \\"good behavior\\" is well understood to mean Justices may serve for the remainder of their lives, although they can voluntarily resign or retire. A Justice can also be removed by Congressional impeachment and conviction. However, only one Justice has been impeached by the House (Samuel Chase, in 1805) and he was acquitted in the Senate. Moves to impeach sitting justices have occurred more recently (for example, William O. Douglas was the subject of hearings twice, once in 1953 and again in 1970), but they have not reached a vote in the House. No mechanism presently exists for removing a Justice who is permanently incapacitated by illness or injury, both unable to resign and unable to resume service.[24]\\r\\nBecause Justices have indefinite tenure, it is impossible to know when a vacancy will next occur. Sometimes vacancies arise in quick succession, as in the early 1970s when Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr. and William H. Rehnquist were nominated to replace Hugo Black and John Marshall Harlan II, who retired within a week of each other. Sometimes a great length of time passes between nominations such as the eleven years between Stephen Breyer's nomination in 1994 and the departures of Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor (by death and retirement, respectively) in 2005 and 2006.\\r\\nIt is also theoretically possible for Congress to create additional vacancies by expanding the Court itself. The United States Constitution does not specify the size of the Supreme Court, but in Article III it authorizes the Congress to fix the number of justices. The Judiciary Act of 1789 called for the appointment of six justices. As the country grew geographically, Congress increased the number of justices to correspond with the growing number of judicial circuits. In 1807, the court was expanded to seven members, allowing Thomas Jefferson to appoint Thomas Todd as a new Justice. The expansion to nine members in 1837 allowed Andrew Jackson to appoint John Catron, and Martin Van Buren to appoint John McKinley; and the addition of a tenth seat in 1863 allowed Abraham Lincoln to name Stephen Johnson Field to the Court. However, at the request of Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, Congress passed the Judicial Circuits Act (1866) which provided that the next three justices to retire would not be replaced; thus, the size of the Court should have eventually reached seven by attrition. Consequently, one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867. However, this law did not play out to completion, for in the Judiciary Act of 1869,[25] also known as the Circuit Judges Act, the number of justices was again set at nine, where it has since remained. The new seat created in 1869 was filled the following year by Ulysses S. Grant's appointment of Joseph P. Bradley - the last justice to be appointed to a newly created seat on the Court.\\r\\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to expand the Court in 1937, seeking to appoint an additional justice for each incumbent justice who reached the age of 70?years 6?months and refused retirement; under Roosevelt's proposal, such appointments would continue until the Court reached a maximum size of 15 justices. Ostensibly, the proposal was made to ease the burdens of the docket on the elderly judges, but the President's actual purpose was to pack the Court with justices who would support New Deal policies and legislation.[26] This plan, usually called the \\"Court-packing Plan\\", failed in Congress and proved a political disaster for Roosevelt.[27] The balance of the Court shifted with the retirement of Willis Van Devanter and the confirmation of Hugo Black in August 1937. By the end of 1941, Roosevelt had appointed seven Supreme Court justices and elevated Harlan Fiske Stone to Chief Justice.[28]\\r\\nDespite the variability, nearly all Presidents so far have been able to appoint at least one Justice. The four exceptions are William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Andrew Johnson, and Jimmy Carter. Harrison died a month after taking office, though his successor (John Tyler) made an appointment during that presidential term. Taylor likewise died early in his presidential term, although his successor (Millard Fillmore) also made a Supreme Court nomination before the end of that term. Johnson was denied the opportunity to appoint a Justice by a contraction in the size of the Supreme Court, which Congress may dictate. Jimmy Carter is the only President who completed at least one full term in office without making a nomination to the Court during his presidency.","input":"How many votes needed to confirm a supreme court justice?"},{"output":"July 15, 2005","context":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a 2005 musical fantasy comedy film directed by Tim Burton and written by John August, based on the 1964 British novel of the same name by Roald Dahl. The film stars Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka and Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket. The storyline follows Charlie, who wins a contest and is along with four other contest winners, subsequently led by Wonka on a tour of his chocolate factory, the most magnificent in the world.\\r\\nDevelopment for a second adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (filmed previously as Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory in 1971) began in 1991, which resulted in Warner Bros. providing the Dahl Estate with total artistic control. Prior to Burton's involvement, directors such as Gary Ross, Rob Minkoff, Martin Scorsese and Tom Shadyac had been involved, while actors Bill Murray, Nicolas Cage, Jim Carrey, Michael Keaton, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, Adam Sandler, and many others, were either in discussion with or considered by the studio to play Wonka.\\r\\nBurton immediately brought regular collaborators Depp and Danny Elfman aboard. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory represents the first time since The Nightmare Before Christmas that Elfman contributed to a film score using written songs and his vocals. Filming took place from June to December 2004 at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released to positive critical reception and was a box office success, grossing $475 million worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie Bucket is a kind and loving boy living in poverty with his parents and four bedridden grandparents. They all rely on his father for income, employed at a toothpaste factory, responsible for putting the caps on the tubes. Mr. Bucket is later laid off when the factory replaces him with a machine that puts the caps on the tubes. Down the street is Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, which reopened after industrial espionage forced him into seclusion and sacking his employees. Charlie's Grandpa Joe worked for Wonka before the termination.\\r\\nWonka announces a contest whereby children that find Golden Tickets hidden in five Wonka bars will be given a tour of the factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate, and one a chance to be presented with an unknown grand prize. Four tickets are quickly found: the greedy and gluttonous Augustus Gloop from Dsseldorf, who found the ticket while eating a bar; the spoiled and rotten Veruca Salt from Buckinghamshire, who made her father buy as many Wonka bars as possible; the gum chewing and boastful Violet Beauregarde from Atlanta, who gave up gum and started buying bars after hearing of the tickets; and the arrogant and aggressive Mike Teavee from Denver, who retracked the manufacturing dates and hacked the system. Charlie hopes to find a ticket, but his chances are small as money is tight, and the best has to be made of his annual birthday present of one Wonka bar and a bar bought by Grandpa Joe's money, both of which yield no tickets. All hope is seemingly gone when the last ticket is apparently claimed in Russia. Charlie, on finding some money in the street, just intends to enjoy one chocolate bar when news breaks that the ticket was fake. To Charlie's surprise, he finds the bar he just bought has the real last Golden Ticket. Bystanders attempt to separate him from it, only for the shopkeeper to see that he keeps the ticket, and gets back home with it.\\r\\nWhen Grandpa Joe sees the ticket, he jumps out of bed and dances with joy. He offers to accompany Charlie on the tour, but Charlie explains how he was offered money for the ticket, and intends to sell it. Grandpa George reminds Charlie that money is far more common than the tickets, and convinces Charlie to keep it. Upon meeting him on the day of the tour, the visitors find Wonka to be peculiar, lonely, and acting odd at the mention of \\"parents\\". The tour shows how the fantastical factory operates under the efforts of the short humans called Oompa-Loompas.\\r\\nAs Charlie seems to enjoy the entire tour, the other four children succumb to temptation, ending up being caught in the factory workings, and have to be safely recovered by the Oompa-Loompas, albeit in worse shape than at the start of the tour: Augustus falls into a river of chocolate and is pulled in by a pipe before being rescued from the fudge processing center; Violet expands into an oversized blueberry when she tries an experimental piece of chewing gum despite Wonka's warning; Veruca is thrown away as a \\"bad nut\\" by trained squirrels down the garbage chute; and Mike is shrunk down after being the first person transported by Wonka's new television advertising invention. The four leave the factory revealing their deformities; a chocolate-covered Augustus, a much more flexible but still blue Violet, a garbage-covered Veruca and her father, and a taller and paper-thin Mike who was overstretched with the \\"taffy puller\\".\\r\\nDuring the tour, flashbacks reveal Wonka's troubled childhood; his strict father, Wilbur, a prominent dentist, forbade Wonka from candy consumption, but after managing to sneak a taste, he became hooked, and later ran away from home to live his dream. He then returned several days later to find his father and home completely gone.\\r\\nWonka then brings Charlie and Grandpa Joe home using the Great Glass Elevator. Upon arrival, Charlie is congratulated as the only remaining child and the winner of the grand prize: being named heir to Wonka's factory (and presumably, his company). Unfortunately, Wonka stipulates that Charlie's family has to stay behind; therefore, to Wonka's dismay, Charlie rejects the offer. Wonka then sadly flies back to the factory in his great glass elevator, leaving a hole in the roof. Mr. Bucket is later given a new job at the toothpaste factory as a technician.\\r\\nSome days later, Wonka's candies are selling poorly, and he comes to associate his unhappiness with the financial state of his company, so he makes an effort to find Charlie. After discovering Wonka's troubled past, Charlie helps him locate his father. When they visit, it appears that despite his strict prohibition of candy, the dentist has followed Willy's success, and they reconcile. Wonka allows Charlie's family to move into the factory, while he and Charlie plan new product lines to produce.\\r\\nAuthor Roald Dahl disapproved of the 1971 film adaptation and declined the film rights to produce the sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator.[5] Warner Bros. and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment entered discussions with the Dahl estate in 1991, hoping to purchase the rights to produce another film version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The purchase was finalized in 1998,[6] with Dahl's widow, Felicity (\\"Liccy\\"), and daughter, Lucy, receiving total artistic control and final privilege on the choices of actors, directors and writers. The Dahl Estate's subsequent protection of the source material was the main reason that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory had languished in development hell since the 1990s.[7][8]\\r\\nScott Frank was hired to write the screenplay in February 1999, after approaching Warner Bros. for the job.[8] Frank, a recent Oscar nominee for the R-rated crime film Out of Sight, wanted to work on a film that his children could enjoy.[9][10][11] As an enthusiastic fan of the book, he intended to remain more truthful to Dahl's vision than the 1971 film had been.[8] Nicolas Cage was under discussions for Willy Wonka, but lost interest.[5][12] Gary Ross signed to direct in February 2000,[13] which resulted in Frank completing two drafts of the screenplay,[11] before leaving with Ross in September 2001.[14] Both Warner Bros. and the Dahl Estate wanted Frank to stay on the project, but he faced scheduling conflicts and contractual obligations with Minority Report (2002) and The Lookout (2007).[11]\\r\\nRob Minkoff entered negotiations to take the director's position in October 2001,[15] and Gwyn Lurie was hired to start from scratch on a new script in February 2002. Lurie said she would adapt the original book and ignore the 1971 film adaptation. Dahl's estate championed Lurie after being impressed with her work on another Dahl adaptation, a live-action adaptation of The BFG, for Paramount Pictures, which was never made (Paramount distributed the earlier 1971 film version of Charlie, and later sold the rights to WB).[16] In April 2002, Martin Scorsese was involved with the film, albeit briefly, but opted to direct The Aviator instead.[5][12] Warner Bros. president Alan F. Horn wanted Tom Shadyac to direct Jim Carrey as Willy Wonka, believing the duo could make Charlie and the Chocolate Factory relevant to mainstream audiences, but Liccy Dahl opposed this.[7]\\r\\nAfter receiving enthusiastic approval from the Dahl Estate, Warner Bros. hired Tim Burton to direct in May 2003.[6] Burton compared the project's languishing development to Batman (1989), which he directed, in how there had been varied creative efforts with both films. He said, \\"Scott Frank's version was the best, probably the clearest, and the most interesting, but they had abandoned that.\\"[17] Liccy Dahl commented that Burton was the first and only director the estate was happy with. He had previously produced another of the author's adaptations with James and the Giant Peach (1996), and, like Roald and Liccy, disliked the 1971 film because it strayed from the book's storyline.[7]\\r\\nTim Burton[17]\\r\\nDuring pre-production Burton visited Dahl's former home in the Buckinghamshire village of Great Missenden. Liccy Dahl remembers Burton entering Dahl's famed writing shed and saying, \\"This is the Buckets' house!\\" and thinking to herself, \\"Thank God, somebody gets it.\\" Liccy also showed Burton the original handwritten manuscripts, which Burton discovered were more politically incorrect than the published book. The manuscripts included a child named Herpes, after the sexually transmitted disease.[17] Burton immediately thought of Johnny Depp for the role of Willy Wonka, who in August 2003 joined the film, his fourth collaboration with the director.[18]\\r\\nLurie's script received a rewrite by Pamela Pettler, who worked with Burton on Corpse Bride, but the director hired Big Fish screenwriter John August in December 2003 to start from scratch.[12] Both August and Burton were fans of the book since their childhoods.[17] August first read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when he was eight years old, and subsequently sent Dahl a fan letter. He did not see the 1971 film prior to his hiring, which Burton believed would be fundamental in having August stay closer to the book.[19] The writer updated the Mike Teavee character into an obsessive video game player, as compared to the novel, in which he fantasized about violent crime films. The characters Arthur Slugworth and Prodnose were reduced to brief cameo appearances, while Mr. Beauregarde was entirely omitted.[20]\\r\\nBurton and August also worked together in creating Wilbur Wonka, Willy's domineering dentist father. Burton thought the paternal character would help explain Willy Wonka himself and that otherwise he would be \\"just a weird guy\\".[3] The element of an estranged father-son relationship had previously appeared in Big Fish, similarly directed by Burton and written by August. Warner Bros. and the director held differences over the characterizations of Charlie Bucket and Willy Wonka. The studio wanted to entirely delete Mr. Bucket and make Willy Wonka the idyllic father figure Charlie had longed for his entire life. Burton believed that Wonka would not be a good father, finding the character similar to a recluse.[21] Burton said, \\"In some ways, he's more screwed up than the kids.\\" Warner Bros. also wanted Charlie to be a whiz kid, but Burton resisted the characterization. He wanted Charlie to be an average child who would be in the background and not get in trouble.[17]\\r\\nPrior to Burton's involvement, Warner Bros. considered or discussed Willy Wonka with Bill Murray, Christopher Walken, Steve Martin, Robin Williams, Nicolas Cage, Jim Carrey, Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, Mike Myers, Ben Stiller, Leslie Nielsen, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Patrick Stewart, and Adam Sandler.[22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29] Dustin Hoffman and Marilyn Manson reportedly wanted the role as well.[24][30] Pitt's production company, Plan B Entertainment, however, stayed on to co-finance the film with Warner Bros.[7] Coincidentally, Cleese, Idle and Palin (as well as the other three Monty Python members) had all previously expressed interest in playing Wonka in the 1971 film adaptation.[29] Johnny Depp was the only actor Burton considered for the role,[17] although Dwayne Johnson was Burton's second choice in case Depp was unavailable.[31] Depp signed on without reading the script under the intention of going with a completely different approach than what Gene Wilder did in the 1971 film adaptation.[32] Depp said regardless of the original film, Gene Wilder's characterization of Willy Wonka stood out as a unique portrayal.[7]\\r\\nDepp and Burton derived their Willy Wonka from children's television show hosts such as Bob Keeshan (Captain Kangaroo), Fred Rogers, and Al Lewis from The Uncle Al Show, and Depp also took inspiration from various game show hosts.[33] Burton recalled from his childhood that the characters were bizarre but left lasting impressions. He said, \\"It was kind of a strange amalgamation of these weird children's TV show hosts.\\"[17] Depp based Wonka's look (exaggerated bob cut and sunglasses) on Vogue magazine editor Anna Wintour.[34]\\r\\nComparisons were drawn between Willy Wonka and Michael Jackson. Burton disagreed with the comparisons and said Jackson, unlike Wonka, liked children.[21] Depp said the similarities with Jackson never occurred to him. Instead, he compared Wonka to Howard Hughes due to his \\"reclusive, germaphobe, controlling\\" nature.[33] Burton agreed with the similarity to Hughes. He also cited Charles Foster Kane from Citizen Kane as an inspiration for Wonka, as Kane is \\"somebody who was brilliant but then was traumatized and then retreats into their own world\\".[17] Depp wanted to sport prosthetic makeup for the part and have a long, elongated nose, but Burton believed it would be too outrageous. During production, Gene Wilder, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, accused the filmmakers of only remaking the 1971 film for the purpose of money. Depp said he was disappointed by Wilder's comment, and responded that the film was not a remake, but a new adaptation of Dahl's 1964 book.[3]\\r\\nThe casting calls for Charlie Bucket, Violet Beauregarde, Veruca Salt, and Mike Teavee took place in the United States and United Kingdom, while Augustus Gloop's casting took place in Germany. Burton said he sought actors \\"who had something of the character in them\\", and found Mike Teavee the hardest character to cast.[17] Burton was finding trouble casting Charlie, until Depp, who had worked with Freddie Highmore on Finding Neverland, suggested Highmore for the part.[5] Highmore had already read the book before, but decided to read it once more prior to auditioning.[35] The actor did not see the original film adaptation, and chose not to see it until after Burton's production, so his portrayal would not be influenced.[36]\\r\\nBefore Adam Godley was officially cast as Mr. Teavee, Dan Castellaneta, Tim Allen, Ed O'Neill, Bob Saget, and Ray Romano were all considered for the role.[22]\\r\\nIt has been rumored that Gregory Peck was considered for the role of Grandpa Joe.[37] Other actors that were considered for Grandpa Joe included Richard Attenborough, Kirk Douglas, Albert Finney, Anthony Hopkins, Paul Newman, Max von Sydow, David Warner, Christopher Lloyd and Peter Ustinov.[38]\\r\\nPrincipal photography for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory started on June 21, 2004[12] at Pinewood Studios in England.[39] Director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elfman found filming somewhat difficult because they were simultaneously working on Corpse Bride.[21] The Wonka Factory exterior was coincidentally constructed on the same backlot Burton had used for Gotham City in Batman (1989).[17] The ceremonial scene required 500 local extras.[7] The Chocolate Room/River setpiece filled Pinewood's 007 Stage. As a consequence of British Equity rules, which state that children can only work four and a half hours a day, filming for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory took six months, ending in December 2004.[17]\\r\\nThe architecture of the Bucket family home was influenced by Burton's visit to Roald Dahl's writing hut. Like the book, the film has a \\"timeless\\" setting and is not set in a specific country. \\"We've tried not to pinpoint it to any place,\\" production designer Alex McDowell explained. \\"The cars, in fact, drive down the middle of the road.\\"[7] The town, whose design was shaped by the black and white urban photography of Bill Brandt, as well as Pittsburgh and Northern England, is arranged like a medieval village, with Wonka's estate on top and the Bucket shack below.[7] The filmmakers also used fascist architecture for Wonka's factory exterior, and designed most of the sets on 360 sound stages, similar to cycloramas. Burton biographer Mark Salisbury wrote that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory \\"melds 1950s and '70s visuals with a futuristic sensibility that seems straight out of a 1960s sense of the future.\\"[17] The \\"TV Room\\" was patterned after photographs from the films 2001: A Space Odyssey, Danger: Diabolik, and THX 1138. Danger Diabolik also served as inspiration for the Nut Room and Inventing Room.[17]\\r\\nTim Burton avoided using too many digital effects because he wanted the younger actors to feel as if they were working in a realistic environment.[40] As a result, forced perspective techniques, oversized props and scale models were used to avoid computer-generated imagery (CGI).[17] Deep Roy was cast to play the Oompa-Loompas based on his previous collaborations with Burton on Planet of the Apes and Big Fish. The actor was able to play various Oompa-Loompas using split screen photography, digital and front projection effects.[3] \\"Tim told me that the Oompa-Loompas were strictly programmed, like robots? all they do is work, work, work,\\" Roy commented. \\"So when it comes time to dance, they're like a regiment; they do the same steps.\\"[41]\\r\\nA practical method was considered for the scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for the beginnings of the swelling scene, before the decision was made to do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give the impression that her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.\\r\\nRather than rely on CGI, Burton wanted the 40 squirrels in the Nut Room to be real. The animals were trained every day for 10 weeks before filming commenced. They began their coaching while newborns, fed by bottles to form relationships with human trainers. The squirrels were each taught how to sit upon a little blue bar stool, tap and then open a walnut, and deposit its meat onto a conveyor belt.[7] \\"Ultimately, the scene was supplemented by CGI and animatronics,\\" Burton said, \\"but for the close-ups and the main action, they're the real thing.\\"[17] Wonka's Viking boat for the Chocolate River sequence floats down a realistic river filled with 192,000 gallons of faux melted chocolate.[42] \\"Having seen the first film, we wanted to make the chocolate river look edible,\\" McDowell said. \\"In the first film, it's so distasteful.\\" The production first considered a CGI river, but Burton was impressed with the artificial substance when he saw how it clung to the boat's oars. Nine shades of chocolate were tested before Burton settled on the proper hue.[7]\\r\\nThe original music score was written by Danny Elfman, a frequent collaborator with director Tim Burton. Elfman's score is based around three primary themes: a gentle family theme for the Buckets, generally set in upper woodwinds; a mystical, string-driven waltz for Willy Wonka; and a hyper-upbeat factory theme for full orchestra, Elfman's homemade synthesizer samples and the diminutive chanting voices of the Oompa-Loompas.[43]\\r\\nElfman also wrote and performed the vocals for four songs, with pitch changes and modulations to represent different singers.[44] The lyrics to the Oompa-Loompa songs are adapted from the original book, and are thus credited to Roald Dahl.[43] Following Burton's suggestion, each song in the score is designed to reflect a different archetype.[44] \\"Wonka's Welcome Song\\" is a maddeningly cheerful theme park ditty, \\"Augustus Gloop\\" a Bollywood spectacle (per Deep Roy's suggestion),[41] \\"Violet Beauregarde\\" is 1970s funk, \\"Veruca Salt\\" is 1960s bubblegum pop / psychedelic pop, and \\"Mike Teavee\\" is a tribute to late 1970s hard rock (such as Queen) and early 1980s hair bands.[43][44]\\r\\nThe original motion picture soundtrack was released on July 12, 2005 by Warner Bros. Records.\\r\\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory had its premiere at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre, on July 10, 2005, where money for the Make-a-Wish Foundation was raised.[45] The film was released in the United States on July 15, 2005 in 3,770 theaters[46] (including IMAX theaters).[47]\\r\\nEarly in the development of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in February 2000, Warner Bros. announced their intention of marketing the film[13] with a Broadway theatre musical after release. The studio reiterated their interest in May 2003,[6] however, the idea was postponed by the time filming began in June 2004.[7] The main tie-in for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory focused on The Willy Wonka Candy Company, a division of Nestl. A small range of Wonka Bars were launched, utilizing their prominence in the film.[48] The release of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory also rekindled public interest in Roald Dahl's 1964 book, and appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list from July 3 to October 23, 2005.[49][50]\\r\\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory earned $56,178,450 in its opening weekend,[46] the fifth-highest opening weekend gross for 2005, and stayed at #1 for two weeks.[51] The film eventually grossed $206,459,076 in US totals and $268,509,687 in foreign countries, coming to a worldwide total of $474,968,763. It was the fifty-eighth highest-grossing film of all time when released,[46] as well as seventh-highest for the US[51] and eighth-highest worldwide for the year of 2005.[52]\\r\\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 83% based on 222 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Closer to the source material than 1971's Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is for people who like their Chocolate visually appealing and dark.\\"[53] On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[54] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"Aÿ\\" on an A+ to F scale.[55]\\r\\nOwen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, writing \\"Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka may be a stone freak, but he is also one of Burton's classic crackpot conjurers, like Beetlejuice or Ed Wood.\\"[56] Roger Ebert gave an overall positive review and enjoyed the film. He was primarily impressed by Tim Burton's direction of the younger cast members, but was disappointed with Depp's performance: \\"What was Depp thinking of? In Pirates of the Caribbean he was famously channeling Keith Richards, which may have primed us to look for possible inspirations for this performance.\\"[57] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle found Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Burton's \\"best work in years. If all the laughs come from Depp, who gives Willy the mannerisms of a classic Hollywood diva, the film's heart comes from Highmore, a gifted young performer whose performance is sincere, deep and unforced in a way that's rare in a child actor.\\"[58] Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone magazine that \\"Depp's deliciously demented take on Willy Wonka demands to be seen. Depp goes deeper to find the bruises on Wonka's secret heart than what Gene Wilder did. Depp and Burton may fly too high on the vapors of pure imagination, but it's hard to not get hooked on something this tasty. And how about that army of Oompa-Loompas, all played by Deep Roy, in musical numbers that appear to have been choreographed by Busby Berkeley on crack.\\"[59]\\r\\nAnn Hornaday of The Washington Post criticized Depp's acting. \\"The cumulative effect isn't pretty. Nor is it kooky, funny, eccentric or even mildly interesting. Indeed, throughout his fey, simpering performance, Depp seems to be straining so hard for weirdness that the entire enterprise begins to feel like those excruciating occasions when your parents tried to be hip. Aside from Burton's usual eye-popping direction, the film's strenuous efforts at becoming a camp classic eventually begin to wear thin.\\"[60]\\r\\nIn 2007, Gene Wilder said he chose not to see the film. \\"The thing that put me off ... I like Johnny Depp, I like him, as an actor I like him very much ... but when I saw little pieces in the promotion of what he was doing, I said I don't want to see the film, because I don't want to be disappointed in him.\\"[61] In 2013, when Wilder was asked about the Burton remake, he said \\"I think it's an insult. It's probably Warner Bros.' insult.\\" He also criticized the choices that Burton made as a director, saying \\"I don't care for that director. He's a talented man, but I don't care for him doing stuff like he did.\\"[62]\\r\\nCostume designer Gabriella Pescucci received an Academy Award nomination, but lost to Colleen Atwood for Memoirs of a Geisha.[63] Johnny Depp lost the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy to Joaquin Phoenix in Walk the Line.[64] More nominations followed from the British Academy Film Awards for Visual Effects, Costume Design (Pescucci), Makeup & Hair (Peter Owen and Ivana Primorac) and Production Design (Alex McDowell).[65] Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was also nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film, as well as Performance by a Younger Actor (Freddie Highmore), Music (Danny Elfman) and Costume (Pescucci).[66] Elfman and screenwriter John August were nominated for a Grammy Award with \\"Wonka's Welcome Song\\".[67]","input":"When was charlie and the chocolate factory released?"},{"output":"an honorific form of address for those members of the clergy of the Catholic Church including bishops, honorary prelates and canons","context":"Monsignor (/m?n?si?nj?r/) is an honorific form of address for those members of the clergy of the Catholic Church including bishops, honorary prelates and canons. In some cases, these ecclesiastical honorific titles derive from the pope, but in other cases it is simply a customary or honorary style belonging to a prelate or honorary prelate. These are granted to individuals who have rendered valuable service to the Church, or who provide some special function in Church governance, or who are members of bodies such as certain chapters. The title is never bestowed on those classified as religious in Catholicism. Although in some languages the word is used as a form of address for bishops, which is indeed its primary use in those languages, this is not customary in English.[1] Monsignor is the apocopic form of the Italian monsignore, from the French mon seigneur, meaning \\"my lord\\". It is abbreviated Mgr,[2][3][4][5] Msgr,[a] or Mons.[b]\\r\\n\\"Monsignor\\" is a form of address, not an appointment: properly speaking, one cannot be \\"made a monsignor\\" or be \\"the monsignor of a parish\\". The title or form of address is associated with certain papal awards, which Pope Paul VI reduced to three classes: those of Protonotary Apostolic, Honorary Prelate, and Chaplain of His Holiness.\\r\\nApart from those working in the Roman Curia and the diplomatic service of the Holy See, it is usually on the proposal of the local bishop that the Pope grants this title to Catholic diocesan clergy. The grant is subject to criteria of the Holy See that include a minimum age.\\r\\nSoon after his election in March 2013, Pope Francis suspended the granting of the honorific title of Monsignor except to members of the Holy See's diplomatic service.[11][12] In December of the same year he communicated his definitive decision to accept no further requests from bishops for appointments to any class but that of Chaplain of His Holiness, the lowest of the three classes, and that candidates presented must be at least 65 years old. He himself, during his 15 years as archbishop of Buenos Aires, never asked that any of his priests receive the title, and he was understood to associate it with clerical \\"careerism\\".[13] Grants already made were not revoked.[13][14][15]\\r\\nAppointments to all three classes of awards continue to be granted to officials of the Roman Curia and the diplomatic service of the Holy See, and there was no revocation of privileges granted to certain bodies such as chapters of canons whereby all their members or some of them have the rank of Protonotary Apostolic, Honorary Prelate or Chaplain of His Holiness.[16]\\r\\nAlso unaffected is the association of the style with the office of vicar general, an appointment made by the bishop of the diocese, not by the Pope. Without necessarily being a protonotary apostolic, a diocesan priest has that titular rank as long as he remains in office.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough in some languages, \\"Monsignore\\", \\"Monseigneur\\", \\"Monsenyor\\", \\"Monse?or\\", and the like are normal forms of address for all higher prelates of the Catholic Church below the rank of cardinal or patriarch, including bishops and archbishops, in English bishops are not usually addressed as \\"Monsignor\\", a title reserved in English for diocesan priests who have received certain specific honorary awards or who hold certain offices.\\r\\nThe written form of address for such a priest is Monsignor (first name) (last name) or The Reverend Monsignor (first name) (last name). The spoken form of address is Monsignor (last name).[17]\\r\\nBefore the simplification of ecclesiastical titles in 1969, those of the lowest class were addressed in English as The Very Reverend Monsignor (in Latin, Reverendissimus Dominus; in Italian, Reverendissimo Monsignore) and those belonging to the higher classes were addressed as The Right Reverend Monsignor (in Latin, Illustrissimus et Reverendissimus Dominus; in Italian, Illustrissimo e Reverendissimo Monsignore).\\r\\nThe 1969 Instruction of the Secretariat of State indicated that the title of \\"Monsignor\\" may be used for bishops. This is normal practice in Italian, French, Catalan, and Spanish, but not in English. The same instruction indicated that, in the case of bishops, \\"Reverendissimus\\" (usually translated in this case as \\"Most Reverend\\", rather than \\"Very Reverend\\"), may be added to the word \\"Monsignor\\", as also in the case of prelates without episcopal rank who head offices of the Roman Curia, judges of the Rota, the Promotor General of Justice and the Defender of the Bond of the Apostolic Signatura, the Protonotaries Apostolic \\"de numero\\", and the four Clerics of the Camera.[18] The (in meaning identical) predicate \\"His Lordship\\" or \\"Your Lordship\\" is, in English, used as a clerical title only for bishops.\\r\\nUntil 1968 there were at least 14 different grades, including domestic prelates, four kinds of protonotaries apostolic, four kinds of papal chamberlains, and at least five types of papal chaplains.[19]\\r\\nPope Paul VI in his motu proprio Pontificalis Domus of 28 March 1968 reduced the grades to three. Since then, protonotaries apostolic have been classified either de numero or supernumerary. Most of the former classes of chamberlains and chaplains were abolished, leaving only a single class of \\"Chaplains of His Holiness\\", a specifically priestly-sounding category.[20]\\r\\nThe three ranks established by Pope Paul VI are, in descending order of precedence:\\r\\nBefore 1968 the appointment of a Privy Chamberlain expired at the death of the Pope who granted it. This no longer holds.[20] Those listed in the index of the Annuario Pontificio as Chaplains of His Holiness continue to be listed in the edition that follow the death of the Pope, as after the deaths of Popes Paul VI and John Paul I in 1978 and after that of Pope John Paul II in 2005.\\r\\nIn 2014, Pope Francis abolished the practice of granting priests the title of \\"monsignor\\", no longer accepting such requests from bishops. However, existing members of all three ranks established by Pope Paul VI retain their membership. Higher ranks are still attained by virtue of membership of certain chapters of canons or because of being a vicar general, and new appointments continue to be made for officials of the Roman Curia and the diplomatic service of the Holy See.[13][14][15]\\r\\nGeneric coat of arms of a protonotary apostolic: amaranth galero with 12 scarlet tassels\\r\\nGeneric coat of arms of an honorary prelate: amaranth galero with 12 violet tassels\\r\\nGeneric coat of arms of a Chaplain of His Holiness: black galero with 12 violet tassels\\r\\nThe 1969 Instruction of the Secretariat of State also simplified the dress of monsignori.\\r\\nUnder legislation of Pope Pius X, vicars general and vicars capitular (the latter are now called diocesan administrators) are titular (not actual) Protonotaries durante munere, i.e. as long as they hold those offices, and so are entitled to be addressed as Monsignor.[21]\\r\\nThe only privileges of dress that Pope Pius X granted them were a black silk fringed sash (fascia), black piping on the biretta with a black tuft,[22] and a black mantelletta. As a result of this they were in some countries referred to as \\"black protonotaries\\".[23][page?needed] However, Pontificalis domus of Paul VI removed this position (titular protonotaries) from the Papal Household, even though the title of \\"monsignor\\", which is to be distinguished from a prelatial rank, has not been withdrawn from vicars general, as can be seen, for instance, from the placing of the abbreviated title \\"Mons.\\" before the name of every member of the secular (diocesan) clergy listed as a vicar general in the Annuario Pontificio. (Honorary titles such as that of \\"Monsignor\\" are not considered appropriate for religious.)\\r\\nUnder Paul VI, the Secretariat of State set minimum qualifications of age and priesthood for the appointment of Chaplains of His Holiness (35 years of age and 10 of priesthood), Honorary Prelates (45 of age and 15 of priesthood) and Protonotaries Apostolic Supernumerary (55 of age and 20 of priesthood). However, it waived the minimum age limit for vicars general proposed for appointment as Honorary Prelates, in view of the fact that, as long as they hold the office of vicar general, they also held the still higher rank of Protonotary Apostolic Supernumerary. For the same reason, the Secretariat of State did not consider it appropriate that someone who was already a vicar general be appointed only a Chaplain of His Holiness. All these criteria have been superseded by the 2013 decision of Pope Francis to grant only the title of Chaplain of His Holiness and to require even for this a minimum age of 65 years.[13]","input":"What is a monsignor in the roman catholic church?"},{"output":"King Saud University","context":"Mohammad bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Arabic: ???? ?? ????? ?? ????????? ?? ?????

He worked as a consultant for the Experts Commission, working for the Saudi Cabinet.[32]\\r\\nOn 15 December 2009, at the age of 24, Mohammad bin Salman entered politics as a special advisor to his father when the latter was the governor of Riyadh Province.[33] At this time, Mohammad bin Salman began to rise from one position to another such as secretary-general of the Riyadh Competitive Council, special advisor to the chairman of the board for the King Abdulaziz Foundation for Research and Archives, and a member of the board of trustees for Albir Society in the Riyadh region.[34]\\r\\nIn October 2011, Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz died, and the current King Salman began his ascent to power by becoming second deputy prime minister and defense minister in November 2011 and making Mohammad bin Salman his private advisor.[35]\\r\\nIn June 2012, Crown Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud died and Prince Muhammad bin Salman moved up into the number two position in the hierarchy, as his father became the new crown prince and first deputy prime minister. He soon began remaking the court in his own image. On 2 March 2013, the chief of the Crown Prince court Prince Saud bin Nayef was appointed governor of the Eastern Province and Prince Mohammad bin Salman succeeded him in the post. He was also given the rank of minister.[36][37][38] On 25 April 2014 Prince Mohammad was appointed state minister.[34]\\r\\nOn 23 January 2015, King Abdullah died, Salman took the throne and Prince Mohammad bin Salman was appointed Minister of Defense.[39] He was also named as the Secretary General of the Royal Court on the same date.[40] In addition he retained his post as the Minister of the State.[41][42]\\r\\nIn Yemen, the political unrest (which began escalating in 2011) rapidly became a major issue for the newly appointed Minister of Defense, with rebel Houthis taking control of northern Yemen in late 2014, followed by President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and his cabinets resignation. Mohammad bin Salmans first move as minister was to mobilize a pan-GCC coalition to intervene following a series of suicide bombings in Sanaa via air strikes against Houthis, and impose a naval blockade.[43] In March 2015, Saudi Arabia began leading a coalition of countries allied against the Houthi rebels.[44] According to The New York Times, \\"Although all agreed that the Kingdom had to respond when the Houthis seized the Yemeni capital and forced the government into exile, Prince Mohammad bin Salman took the lead, launching the war in March 2015 without full coordination across the security services.\\" Prince Mohammed bin Salman maintained restrictive coordination across security services and drove operations from the Maldives. Saudi National Guard Minister Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, who was out of the country, was not in the loop of the operations, and US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter officially declared having trouble reaching him for days after the first strikes.\\"[13] While Prince Mohammad bin Salman sold the war as a quick win on Houthi rebels in Yemen and a way to put President Hadi back in power, however, it became a long war of attrition.[45][46]\\r\\nIn April 2015, Muhammad bin Nayef, who is King Salman's nephew,[47][48] and Prince Mohammad bin Salman became Crown Prince and Deputy Crown Prince, respectively, under King Salmans royal decrees.[49]\\r\\nRegarding his role in the military intervention, Prince Mohammad bin Salman gave his first on-the-record interview on 4 January 2016 to The Economist, which had called him the architect of the war in Yemen. Denying the title, he explained the mechanism of the decision-making institutions actually holding stakes in the intervention, including the council of security and political affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the Saudi side. He added that the Houthis usurped power in the Yemeni capital Sanaa before he served as Minister of Defense.[50][51][45]\\r\\nMohammad bin Salman was appointed Crown Prince on 21 June 2017, following his father's decision to depose Muhammad bin Nayef, making him heir apparent to the throne.[52][53] The change of succession had been predicted in December 2015 by an unusually blunt and public memo published by the German Federal Intelligence Service,[54][55] which was subsequently rebuked by the German government.[56]\\r\\nOn the day he became Crown Prince, U.S. President Donald Trump called Mohammad bin Salman to \\"congratulate him on his recent elevation\\". Trump and the new crown prince pledged \\"close cooperation\\" on security and economic issues, according to the White House, and the two leaders also discussed the need to cut off support for terrorism, the recent diplomatic dispute with Qatar, and the push to secure peace between Israel and the Palestinians.[57] Mohammad bin Salman told the Washington Post in April 2017 that without America's cultural influence on Saudi Arabia, \\"we would have ended up like North Korea.\\"[58]\\r\\nOn 29 January 2015, Prince Mohammad was named the chair of the newly established Council for Economic and Development Affairs,[59] replacing the disbanded Supreme Economic Commission.[59] In April 2015, Prince Mohammad bin Salman was given control over Saudi Aramco by royal decree following his appointment as deputy crown prince.[60]\\r\\nPrince Mohammad bin Salman took the leadership in the restructuring of Saudi Arabia's economy, which he officially announced in April 2016 when he introduced Vision 2030, the country's strategic orientation for the next 15 years. Vision 2030 plans to reform Saudi's economy towards a more diversified and privatized structure. It details goals and measures in various fields, from developing non-oil revenues and privatization of the economy to e-government and sustainable development.[61]\\r\\nAt the inaugural Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh in October 2017, bin Salman announced plans for the creation of Neom, a $500 billion economic zone to cover an area of 26,000 square kilometres on Saudi Arabias Red Sea coast, extending into Jordan and Egypt.[62] Neom aims to attract investment in sectors including renewable energy, biotechnology, robotics and advanced manufacturing.[63][64] The announcement followed plans to develop a 34,000 square kilometre area across a lagoon of 50 islands on Saudi Arabias Red Sea coastline into a luxury tourism destination with laws on a par with international standards.[65][66] In a further effort to boost the tourism industry, in November 2017 it was announced that Saudi Arabia would start issuing tourist visas for foreigners, beginning in 2018.[67]\\r\\nPrince Mohammad bin Salman's biggest bet was his plan to restore the Saudi kingdom's dominance in global oil markets by driving the new competition into bankruptcy, by keeping the oil price low enough for a long enough period. Saudi Arabia persuaded OPEC to do the same. A few small players went bankrupt, but American frackers only shut down their less-profitable operations temporarily, and waited for oil prices to go up again. Saudi Arabia, which had been spending $100 billion a year to keep services and subsidies going, had to admit defeat in November 2016. It then cut production significantly and asked its OPEC partners to do the same.[45]\\r\\nPrince bin Salman has successfully lobbied for regulations restricting the powers of the religious police.[13] Prince bin Salman established an entertainment authority that has hosted comedy shows, pro wrestling events, and monster truck rallies.[13] In an interview with al Arabiya he also shared his idea for \\"Green cards\\" for non-Saudi foreigners.[68]\\r\\nIn February 2017, Saudi Arabia appointed its first woman to head the Saudi Stock Exchange.[69][70]\\r\\nIn April 2017, bin Salman announced a project to build one of the worlds largest cultural, sports and entertainment cities in Al Qidiya, southwest of Riyadh. The 334 square kilometre city will include a safari and a Six Flags theme park.[71][72]\\r\\nAs of February 2018, Saudi women can now open their own business, without a male's permission.[73]\\r\\nAccording to the Saudi Information Ministry, mothers in Saudi Arabia can now retain immediate custody of their children after divorce without having to file any lawsuits.[74]\\r\\nFurther cultural developments followed in December that year with the Saudi Arabias first public concert by a female singer, and in January 2018 a sports stadium in Jeddah became the first in the Kingdom to admit women.[15][75] In the same month it was announced that Saudi Arabia would reopen public cinemas after a ban of 35 years, with plans to have more than 2,000 screens running by 2030.[76]\\r\\nThe first measures undertaken in April 2016 included new taxes and cuts in subsidies, a diversification plan, the creation of a $2 trillion Saudi sovereign wealth fund, and a series of strategic economic reforms called the National Transformation Programme.[77] Prince bin Salman plans to raise capital for the sovereign wealth fund by selling off shares of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned petroleum?and?natural gas?company,[60] with the capital to be re-invested in other sectors such as to implement the diversification plans.[78] However, as of October 2017, the plan for Aramcos IPO listing has been labeled \\"a mess\\" by The Economist.[79]\\r\\nPrince Mohammad bin Salman slashed the state budget, freezing government contracts and reducing the pay of civil employees as part of drastic austerity measures.[80][45]\\r\\nPrince Mohammad is seen as the figure behind the removal of the ban on female drivers in September 2017.[14] He has also chipped away at Saudi Arabias Wali system.[81]\\r\\nIn October 2017, he said the ultra-conservative Saudi state had been \\"not normal\\" for the past 30 years, blaming rigid doctrines that have governed society in a reaction to the Iranian Revolution, which successive leaders \\"didnt know how to deal with\\".[82] According to him, Saudi Arabia is \\"returning to what we were beforea country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world\\".[83] In essence, he was telling the country's clerics that the deal the royal family struck with them after the 1979 siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca is being renegotiated.[84] Building an industrial culture was not compatible with Wahhabism. The Wahhabis were committed to fixed social and gender relationships. These were consistent with an economy built on oil sales, but industrialization requires a dynamic culture with social relations constantly shifting.[85]\\r\\nAccording to Politico, MbS wants to pre-empt a repetition of the downfall of the earlier Saudi states due to familial infighting, internal malaise, external frailty and failure to modernize. Mindful of this history, instead of waiting for todays Saudi state to weaken and fall, MBS is trying to save the country before it collapses.[86]\\r\\nAyaan Hirsi Ali claims that \\"if M.B.S. succeeds in his modernization efforts, Saudis will benefit from new opportunities and freedoms, and the world will benefit from curtailing the Wahhabi radicalization agenda. A decade from now, the kingdom could look more like the United Arab Emirates, its prosperous and relatively forward-looking neighbor.\\"[87]\\r\\nIn May 2017, Mohammad bin Salman publicly warned \\"I confirm to you, no one will survive in a corruption casewhoever he is, even if hes a prince or a minister\\".[88] On 4 November 2017, the Saudi press announced the arrest of the Saudi prince and billionaire Al-Waleed bin Talal, a frequent English-language news commentator and a major shareholder in Citi, News Corp and Twitter, as well as over 40 princes and government ministers at the behest of the Crown Prince on corruption and money laundering charges.[89]\\r\\nOthers arrested or fired in the purge included Mutaib bin Abdullah, head of the Saudi Arabian National Guard, Adel Fakeih, the Minister of Economy and Planning, and the Commander of the Saudi Naval Forces, Admiral Abdullah bin Sultan bin Mohammed Al-Sultan.[89][90]\\r\\nSome analysts saw the arrests as part of a power grab on the part of Salman. The New York Times wrote:\\r\\nWriting for the Huffington Post, University of Delaware professor of Islam and Global Affairs, Muqtedar Khan, speculated as to whether the removal of Talal, a critic of Donald Trump, amounted to a coup.[91] BBC correspondent Frank Gardner was quoted as saying that \\"Prince Mohammed is moving to consolidate his growing power while spearheading a reform programme\\". Yet \\"[i]t is not clear what those detained are suspected of.\\"[92]\\r\\nOther analysts see the purge as part of a move towards reform. Steven Mufson of the Washington Post argues that Crown Prince Mohammed knows that only if he can place the royal family under the law, and not above as it was in the past, can he ask the whole country to change their attitudes relative to taxes [and] subsidies.[93] An analysis from the CBC claimed that \\"the clampdown against corruption resonates with ordinary Saudis who feel that the state has been asking them to accept belt tightening while, at the same time, they see corruption and the power elite accumulating more wealth\\".[94] Bin Salman's ambitious reform agenda is widely popular with Saudi Arabia's burgeoning youth population but faces resistance from some of the old guard more comfortable with the kingdom's traditions of incremental change and rule by consensus.[95] According to a former British ambassador to Riyadh, Bin Salman \\"is the first prince in modern Saudi history whose constituency has not been within the royal family, its outside it. Its been young Saudis, particularly younger Saudi men in the street\\".[96]\\r\\nRobert Jordan, former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said that \\"Certainly Saudi Arabia has had a corruption problem for many years. I think the population, especially, has been very unhappy with princes coming in and grabbing business deals, with public funds going to flood control projects that never seem to get built... I would also say it's a classical power grab move sometimes to arrest your rivals, your potential rivals under the pretext of corruption\\".[97]\\r\\nA Eurasia Group director states that \\"Mohammed bin Salman is in effect taking steps to separate the Al Saud family from the state...The process of destroying old elite networks that monopolized access to profitable contracts bodes well for the business environment.\\"[88][unreliable source?]\\r\\nUS President Trump expressed support for the move, tweeting \\"I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing....Some of those they are harshly treating have been milking their country for years!\\"[98][99] French President Macron, who visited Riyadh days after the purge, when asked about the purge stated \\"this is not the role of a president, and similarly I would not expect a leader of a foreign country to come and infringe on domestic matters,\\"[100]\\r\\nMohammad bin Salman established himself as the chairman of the Prince Mohammad bin Salman Foundation, otherwise known as MiSK, which puts in place activities empowering and enabling the younger generation, in line with Vision 2030s goals of a more developed nation.[101] The foundation was a partner of the 9th UNESCO Youth Forum for Change in 2015.[102] In 2017, the with Vision 2030 goals aligned new city, Neom was announced.[103]\\r\\nThe foundation focuses on the country's youth and provides different means of fostering talent, creative potential, and innovation in a healthy environment that offers opportunities in arts and sciences. The foundation pursues these goals by establishing programs and partnering with local and global organizations. It intends to develop intellectual capability in youth, as well as unlock the potential of all Saudi people.[104] Saudi journalists traveling with Prince Mohammed on foreign delegations have been paid up to $100,000 in cash.[13]\\r\\nIn late 2015, Prince Mohammad attended a meeting between King Salman and U.S. President Barack Obama, where the prince broke protocol to deliver a monologue criticizing U.S. foreign policy.[13] In addition, when Prince bin Salman announced an anti-terrorist military alliance of Islamic countries in December 2015, some of the countries involved said they had not been consulted.[13]\\r\\nOn 10 January 2016, The Independent reported that \\"the BND, the German intelligence agency, portrayed...Saudi defence minister and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman...as a political gambler who is destabilising the Arab world through proxy wars in Yemen and Syria.\\"[49][45][51][105] German officials reacted to the BNDs memo, saying the published statement \\"is not the position of the federal government\\".[56]\\r\\nDuring the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, thousands of civilians were reportedly killed in a major bombing campaign, prompting accusations of war crimes in the intervention.[106][107][108] So far, the war and blockade of Yemen has already cost the kingdom tens of billions of dollars, further aggravated the humanitarian crisis in the country and destroyed much of Yemen's infrastructure but failed to dislodge the Shiite Houthi rebels and their allies from the Yemeni capital.[109][80][49]On March 28, 2018 Saudi Arabia, along with its coalition partner the UAE, donated $930 million USD to the United Nations which, according to UN Secretary-General Antonio Gueterres, \\"(will) help to alleviate the suffering of millions of vulnerable people across Yemen.\\" The funds cover almost one-third of the $2.96 billion required to implement the UN's 2018 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan.[110]\\r\\nDespite promised reforms, the arrests and persecution of activists has risen under Mohammad bin Salman according to the Gulf Centre for Human Rights.[111] The crackdown on human right activists includes the academic and novelist Mustafa al-Hassan, Abdullah al-Malki, Essam al-Zamel, all arrested in 12 September 2017. Two founding members of ACPRA, Abdulaziz al-Shubaily and Issa al-Hamid, were arrested on 16 September 2017, one was charged with \\"communicating with international organisations in order to harm the image of the state\\"[112] and sentenced to 11 years in prison on appeal, and a nine years of travel ban after he served his sentence. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch continue to criticize the Saudi government for its violations of human rights.[24][25][26]\\r\\nIn April 2018, Mohammad met Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who \\"urged the Crown Prince to continue his efforts to advance womens rights, and raised concerns about human rights and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Yemen.\\"[113]\\r\\nIn August 2016, Donald Trump Jr. had a meeting with an envoy representing Mohammad bin Salman and Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi. The envoy offered help to the Trump presidential campaign.[114] The meeting included Joel Zamel, an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation, Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, and Blackwater founder Erik Prince.[115][114]\\r\\nIn 2015, Mohammad bin Salman purchased the Italian-built and Bermuda-registered yacht Serene from Russian vodka tycoon Yuri Shefler for ?500 million.[116][117] In December 2017, a number of sources reported that Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, using his close associate Prince Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud as an intermediary, had bought Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi; the sale in November at $450.3 million set a new record price for a work of art.[118][119][120][121] The Embassy of Saudi Arabia[122], the Government of the United Arab Emirates, which has announced that it is in fact the owner of the painting[123], and the auctioneer Christie's have denied this claim[123]. The painting is presently located at its permanent home in the Louvre Museum's extension in Abu Dhabi, UAE.[124][125]\\r\\nMohammads net worth is estimated at US$3.0 billion.[126] The New York Times has reported that Crown Prince Mohammad has purchased the $300 million Chateau Louis XIV in France.[127]\\r\\nMohammad has travelled extensively around the world, meeting with politicians, business leaders and celebrities.[117] In June 2016, he travelled to Silicon Valley and met key people in the US high tech industry, including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.[128]\\r\\nIn early 2018, Prince Mohammad visited the United States where he met with many top politicians, business people and Hollywood stars, including President Trump, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Henry Kissinger, Michael Bloomberg, George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Oprah Winfrey, Rupert Murdoch, Richard Branson, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman and Dwayne Johnson.[113][129] He also visited the United Kingdom where he met with Prime Minister Theresa May, Queen Elizabeth II and the Prince William.[130]\\r\\nMohammad bin Salman married Princess Sarah bint Mashhoor in 2008. They have four children.[131]","input":"Where was the prince of saudi arabia educated?"},{"output":"Manna","context":"Manna (Hebrew: ???? mn, Greek: ?ϫ; Arabic: ???????, Persian: ?????????), sometimes or archaically spelled mana, is an edible substance which God provided for the Israelites during their travels in the desert during the forty-year period following the Exodus and prior to the conquest of Canaan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Hebrew Bible, manna is described twice: once in Exodus 16:1ÿ36 with the full narrative surrounding it, and once again in Numbers 11:1ÿ9 as a part of a separate narrative. In the description in the Book of Exodus, manna is described as being \\"a fine, flake-like thing\\" like the frost on the ground.[2] It is described in the Book of Numbers as arriving with the dew during the night.[3] Exodus adds that manna was comparable to hoarfrost in color,[2] similarly had to be collected before it was melted by the heat of the sun,[4] and was like a coriander seed in size but white in color.[5] Numbers describes it as having the appearance of bdellium,[6] adding that the Israelites ground it and pounded it into cakes, which were then baked, resulting in something that tasted like cakes baked with oil.[7] Exodus states that raw manna tasted like wafers that had been made with honey.[5] The Israelites were instructed to eat only the manna they had gathered for each day. Stored manna \\"bred worms and stank\\":[8] the exception being that stored the day before the Sabbath (Preparation Day), when twice the amount of manna was gathered. This manna did not spoil overnight, because, Exodus 16:23ÿ24 states:\\r\\nThis is what the Lord commanded: \\"Tomorrow is to be a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.\\" So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.[9]\\r\\nIn the Bread of Life Discourse in John's Gospel, the evangelist refers three times to the manna which the Jews' ancestors ate in the desert: the Jews refer to the manna given to them by Moses as a sign of God's promised covenant, and Jesus asserts that the manna was from God and not from Moses, and that the people who ate it were nourished on their journey but ultimately died. In contrast, according to the gospel, Jesus offered living bread, and whoever ate this bread would never die.[10]\\r\\nThe word mana appears three times in the Qur?n, in Quran 2:57, 7:160 and 20:80.[11] It is narrated in the hadith Sahih Muslim that the Prophet Mohammad said \\"Truffles are part of the 'manna' which Allah sent to the people of Israel through Moses, and its juice is a medicine for the eye.\\"[12]\\r\\nSome scholars have proposed that manna is cognate with the Egyptian term mennu, meaning \\"food\\",[13] a term that has never been attested to in history. At the turn of the twentieth century, Arabs of the Sinai Peninsula were selling resin from the tamarisk tree as man es-simma, roughly meaning \\"heavenly manna\\".[14] Tamarisk trees (particularly Tamarix gallica) were once comparatively extensive throughout the southern Sinai, and their resin is similar to wax, melts in the sun, is sweet and aromatic (like honey), and has a dirty-yellow color, fitting somewhat with the Biblical descriptions of manna.[15][16] However, this resin is mostly composed of sugar, so it would be unlikely to provide sufficient nutrition for a population to survive over long periods of time,[15] and it would be very difficult for it to have been compacted into cakes.[16]\\r\\nOther researchers have believed manna to be a form of lichen - a plant colony that often has a low mass per unit volume density and a large \\"sail area.\\" In particular, Lecanora esculenta has been postulated. Known natural aerial falls of various lichens have been described as occurring in accounts separate from that in the bible. \\"In some parts of Asia Lecanora esculenta covers the soil to such a degree that, according to Parrot, it forms beds 15 to 20 centimetres thick.\\"[17][18]\\r\\nIn the Biblical account, the name manna is said to derive from the question man hu, seemingly meaning \\"What is it?\\";[19] this is perhaps an Aramaic etymology, not a Hebrew one.[16] Man is possibly cognate with the Arabic term man, meaning plant lice, with man hu thus meaning \\"this is plant lice\\",[16] which fits one widespread modern identification of manna, the crystallized honeydew of certain scale insects.[16][20] In the environment of a desert, such honeydew rapidly dries due to evaporation of its water content, becoming a sticky solid, and later turning whitish, yellowish, or brownish;[16] honeydew of this form is considered a delicacy in the Middle East, and is a good source of carbohydrates.[20] In particular, there is a scale insect that feeds on tamarisk, the Tamarisk manna scale (Trabutina mannipara), which is often considered to be the prime candidate for biblical manna.[21][22]\\r\\nAnother type is turkey oak manna, also called Persian gezengevi- gezo, men, Turkish Kudret helvasi, man-es-simma, also Diarbekir manna, or Kurdish manna. It is formed by aphids and appears white. It was common in western Iran, northern Iraq and eastern Turkey. When dried it forms into crystalline lumps which are hard and look like stone. They are pounded before inclusion in breads.[23]\\r\\nA number of ethnomycologists, including Terence McKenna,[24] have suggested that most characteristics of manna are similar to that of Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms, notorious breeding grounds for insects, which decompose rapidly. These peculiar fungi naturally produce a number of molecules that resemble human neurochemicals, and first appear as small fibres (mycelia) that resemble hoarfrost. Psilocybin, the primary psychoactive molecule in the \\"Psilocybe cubensis\\" mushroom, has been shown to produce spiritual experiences, with \\"personal meaning and spiritual significance\\" when test subjects were evaluated 14 months later.[25]\\r\\nOther minority identifications of manna are that it was a kosher species of locust,[26] or that it was the sap of certain succulent plants (such as those of the genus Alhagi, which have an appetite-suppressing effect).\\r\\nSome form critics posit conflicting descriptions of manna as derived from different lore, with the description in Numbers being from the Jahwist tradition, and the description in Exodus being from the later Priestly tradition.[27][28] The Babylonian Talmud states that the differences in description were due to the taste varying depending on who ate it, with it tasting like honey for small children, like bread for youths, and like oil for the elderly.[29] Similarly, classical rabbinical literature rectifies the question of whether manna came before or after dew, by holding that the manna was sandwiched between two layers of dew, one falling before the manna, and the other after.[14]\\r\\nManna is from Heaven, according to the Hebrew Bible [30] and to Jesus in the New Testament,[31] but the various identifications of manna are naturalistic. In the Mishnah, manna is treated as a natural but unique substance, \\"created during the twilight of the sixth day of Creation\\",[32] and ensured to be clean, before it arrives, by the sweeping of the ground by a northern wind and subsequent rains.[33] According to classical rabbinical literature, manna was ground in a heavenly mill for the use of the righteous, but some of it was allocated to the wicked and left for them to grind themselves.[14]\\r\\nUntil they reached Canaan, the Israelites are implied by some passages in the Bible to have eaten only manna during their desert sojourn,[34] despite the availability of milk and meat from the livestock with which they traveled, and the references to provisions of fine flour, oil, and meat, in parts of the journey's narrative.[14]\\r\\nAs a natural food substance, manna would produce waste products; but in classical rabbinical literature, as a supernatural substance, it was held that manna produced no waste, resulting in no defecation among the Israelites until several decades later, when the manna had ceased to fall.[35] Modern medical science suggests the lack of defecation over such a long period of time would cause severe bowel problems, especially when other food later began to be consumed again. Classical rabbinical writers say that the Israelites complained about the lack of defecation, and were concerned about potential bowel problems.[35]\\r\\nMany Christian vegetarians say that God had originally intended man would not eat meat because plants cannot move and killing them would not be sinful: manna, a nonmeat substance, is used to support this theory.[36] Further, when the people complained and wished for quail, God gave it to them, but they apparently still complained and some greedily gathered the quail. \\"While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of the Lord was kindled against the people.\\"[37]\\r\\nFood was not manna's only use; one classical rabbinical source states that the fragrant odor of manna was used in an Israelite perfume.[14]\\r\\nExodus says each day one omer of manna was gathered per family member (about 3.64 litres),[38] and may imply this was regardless of how much effort was put into gathering it;[39] a midrash attributed to Rabbi Tanhuma remarks that although some were diligent enough to go into the fields to gather manna, others just lay down lazily and caught it with their outstretched hands.[40] The Talmud states that this factor was used to solve disputes about the ownership of slaves, since the number of omers of manna each household could gather would indicate how many people were legitimately part of the household;[41] the omers of manna for stolen slaves could be gathered only by legitimate owners, and therefore legitimate owners would have spare omers of manna.[41]\\r\\nAccording to the Talmud, manna was found near the homes of those with strong belief in God, and far from the homes of those with doubts;[41] indeed, one classical midrash says that manna was intangible to Gentiles, as it would inevitably slip from their hands.[42] The Midrash Tanhuma holds that manna melted, formed liquid streams, was drunk by animals, flavored the animal flesh, and was thus indirectly eaten by Gentiles, this being the only way that Gentiles could taste manna.[43] Despite these hints of uneven distribution, classical rabbinical literature expresses the view that manna fell in very large quantities each day. It holds that manna was layered out over 2,000 cubits square, between 50 and 60 cubits in height, enough to nourish the Israelites for 2,000 years[14] and to be seen from the palaces of every king in the East and West.[44] This is probably a metaphorical statement.\\r\\nAccording to Exodus, Shabbat (Sabbath) was reinstituted the first week manna appeared.[45] It states that twice as much manna as usual was available on the sixth morning of the week, and none at all could be found on the seventh day;[46] although manna usually rotted and became maggot-infested after a single night,[8] that which had been collected on the sixth day remained fresh until the second night.[47] Moses stated that the double portion of Preparation Day was to be consumed on Shabbat;[45] and that God instructed him that no one should leave his place on Shabbat,[48] so that the people could rest during it.[49]\\r\\nForm critics regard this part of the manna narrative to be spliced together from the Yahwist and Priestly traditions, with the Yahwist tradition emphasizing rest during Shabbat, while the Priestly tradition merely states that Shabbat exists, implying that the meaning of \\"Shabbat\\" was already known.[16][50] These critics regard this part of the manna narrative as an etiological supernature story designed to explain the origin of Shabbat observance, which in reality was probably pre-Mosaic.[16]\\r\\nExodus states that the Israelites consumed the manna for forty years, starting from the fifteenth day of the second month (Iyar 15),[51] but that it then ceased to appear once they had reached a settled land, and once they had reached the borders of Canaan (inhabited by the Canaanites).[52] Form critics attribute this variation to the view that each expression of the manna ceasing derives from different lore; the \\"settled land\\" is attributed to the Priestly tradition,[16][50] and \\"Canaan's borders\\" to the Yahwist tradition, or to a hypothetical later redaction to synchronize the account with that of the Book of Joshua,[16][50] which states that the manna ceased to appear on the day after the annual Passover festival (Nisan 14), when the Israelites had reached Gilgal.[53] The duration from Iyar 15 to Nisan 14, taken literally, is forty years less one month.\\r\\nThere is also a disagreement among classical rabbinical writers as to when the manna ceased, particularly in regard to whether it remained after the death of Moses for a further forty days, seventy days, or fourteen years;[54] indeed, according to Joshua ben Levi, the manna ceased to appear at the moment that Moses died.[14]\\r\\nDespite the eventual termination of the supply of manna, Exodus states that a small amount of it survived within an omer-sized pot or jar, which was kept facing the Testimony (possibly, adjacent to the Ark of the Covenant);[55] it indicates that God instructed this of Moses, who delegated it to Aaron.[56] The Epistle to the Hebrews states that the pot was stored inside the Ark.[57] Classical rabbinical sources believe the pot was made of gold; some say it was only there for the generation following Moses, and others that it survived at least until the time of Jeremiah.[14] However, the First Book of Kings states that it was absent earlier than Jeremiah, during Solomon's reign in the tenth century B.C.[58] Form critics attribute the mention of the pot to the Priestly tradition, concluding that the pot existed in the early sixth century B.C.[50]\\r\\nBy extension, \\"manna\\" has been used to refer to any divine or spiritual nourishment.\\r\\nAt the Basilica of Saint Nicholas in Bari, Italy, there is an annual ceremony of collecting a clear liquid from the tomb of Saint Nicholas;[59] legend credits the pleasant perfume of this liquid with warding off evil, and it is sold to pilgrims as \\"the Manna of Saint Nicholas\\".[60] The liquid gradually seeps out of the tomb, but it is unclear whether it originates from the body within the tomb, or from the marble itself; since the town of Bari is a harbor, and the tomb is below sea level, there are several natural explanations for the manna fluid, including the transfer of seawater to the tomb by capillary action.[61]\\r\\nIn the seventeenth century, a woman marketed a clear, tasteless product as a cosmetic, \\"the Manna of Saint Nicholas of Bari\\". After the deaths of some 600 men, Italian authorities discovered that the alleged cosmetic was a preparation of arsenic, used by their wives.[62]\\r\\nIn a modern botanical context, manna is often used to refer to the secretions of various plants, especially of certain shrubs and trees, and in particular the sugars obtained by evaporating the sap of the manna ash, extracted by making small cuts in the bark.[63] The manna ash, native to southern Europe and southwest Asia, produces a blue-green sap, which has medicinal value as a mild laxative,[64] demulcent, and weak expectorant.[62]\\r\\nThe names of both the sugar mannose and its hydrogenated sugar alcohol, mannitol, are derived from manna.[65]\\r\\nRobert Nozick references \\"manna from heaven\\" in a thought experiment about distributive justice.[66]\\r\\n Media related to Manna at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What did the israelites eat during their wandering in the wilderness?"},{"output":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi","context":"This is an overview of events in the film world during 2017, including the highest-grossing films, award ceremonies, festivals, and lists of films released and deaths.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Brody of The New Yorker observed that for 2017, \\"the most important event in the world of movies was the revelation, in the Times and The New Yorker, of sexual abuse by Harvey Weinstein, and the resulting liberation of the long-stifled voices of the people who had been abused by him or other powerful figures in the movie business, and, for that matter, in other arts and industries, too.\\" He emphasizes that in effect, \\"[w]hats missing from the year-end list, and from the era in movies, isnt only the unmade work by these filmmakers but the artistry and the careers of cast and crew members who would have been in their unrealized films.\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe top films released in 2017 by worldwide gross are as follows:[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi, Beauty and the Beast, The Fate of the Furious, and Despicable Me 3 have each grossed over $1 billion, and are ranked as the 11th, 13th, 14th, and 27th highest-grossing films of all time, with the latter being the 4th highest-grossing animated film.

She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and created the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a \\"computing machine\\" and the first computer programmer.[1][2][3]\\r\\nAda Lovelace was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron, and his wife Anne Isabella Milbanke (\\"Annabella\\"), Lady Wentworth.[4] All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women.[5] Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later, eventually dying of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request. She was often ill in her childhood. Ada married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, and Ada in turn became Countess of Lovelace.\\r\\nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens, which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \\"poetical science\\"[6] and herself as an \\"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\\".[7]\\r\\nWhen she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, also known as \\"the father of computers\\", and in particular, Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville.\\r\\nBetween 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the engine, which she supplemented with an elaborate set of notes, simply called Notes. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer programthat is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.[8] Her mindset of \\"poetical science\\" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.[5]\\r\\nShe died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nByron expected his baby to be a \\"glorious boy\\" and was disappointed when his wife gave birth to a girl.[9] Augusta was named after Byron's half-sister, Augusta Leigh, and was called \\"Ada\\" by Byron himself.[10]\\r\\nOn 16 January 1816 Ada's mother, Annabella, at Byron's behest, left for her parents' home at Kirkby Mallory, taking one-month-old Ada with her.[9] Although English law at the time gave fathers full custody of their children in cases of separation, Byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights[11] but did request that his sister keep him informed of Ada's welfare.[12] On 21 April Byron signed the Deed of Separation, although very reluctantly, and left England for good a few days later.[13] Aside from an acrimonious separation, Annabella continually made allegations about Byron's immoral behaviour throughout her life.[14]\\r\\nThis set of events made Ada famous in Victorian society. Byron did not have a relationship with his daughter, and never saw her again. He died in 1824 when she was eight years old. Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life.[15] Ada was not shown the family portrait of her father (covered in green shroud) until her twentieth birthday.[16] Her mother became Baroness Wentworth in her own right in 1856.\\r\\nAnnabella did not have a close relationship with the young Ada and often left her in the care of her own mother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke who doted on her grandchild. However, because of societal attitudes of the timewhich favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigationAnnabella had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about Ada's welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern.[17] In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to Ada as \\"it\\": \\"I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own.\\"[18] In her teenage years, several of her mother's close friends watched Ada for any sign of moral deviation. Ada dubbed these observers the \\"Furies\\" and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her.[19]\\r\\nAda was often ill, beginning in early childhood. At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision.[10] In June 1829, she was paralysed after a bout of measles. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite being ill Ada developed her mathematical and technological skills. At age 12 this future \\"Lady Fairy\\", as Charles Babbage affectionately called her, decided she wanted to fly. Ada went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with imagination and passion. Her first step, in February 1828, was to construct wings. She investigated different material and sizes. She considered various materials for the wings: paper, oilsilk, wires, and feathers. She examined the anatomy of birds to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body. She decided to write a book, Flyology, illustrating, with plates, some of her findings. She decided what equipment she would need; for example, a compass, to \\"cut across the country by the most direct road\\", so that she could surmount mountains, rivers, and valleys. Her final step was to integrate steam with the \\"art of flying\\".[5]\\r\\nIn early 1833 Ada had an affair with a tutor and, after being caught, tried to elope with him. The tutor's relatives recognised her and contacted her mother. Annabella and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal.[20] Ada never met her younger half-sister, Allegra, the daughter of Lord Byron and Claire Clairmont. Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five. Ada did have some contact with Elizabeth Medora Leigh, the daughter of Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh, who purposely avoided Ada as much as possible when introduced at Court.[21]\\r\\nLovelace became close friends with her tutor Mary Somerville, who introduced her to Charles Babbage in 1833. She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville,[22] and they corresponded for many years. Other acquaintances included the scientists Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens. She was presented at Court at the age of seventeen \\"and became a popular belle of the season\\" in part because of her \\"brilliant mind.\\"[23] By 1834 Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and was able to charm many people, and was described by most people as being dainty, although John Hobhouse, Byron's friend, described her as \\"a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend's features, particularly the mouth\\".[24] This description followed their meeting on 24 February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably because of the influence of her mother, which led her to dislike all of her father's friends. This first impression was not to last, and they later became friends.[25]\\r\\nOn 8 July 1835, she married William, 8th Baron King, becoming Lady King.[26] They had three homes: Ockham Park, Surrey, a Scottish estate on Loch Torridon in Ross-shire, and a house in London. They spent their honeymoon at Worthy Manor in Ashley Combe near Porlock Weir, Somerset. The Manor had been built as a hunting lodge in 1799 and was improved by King in preparation for their honeymoon. It later became their summer retreat and was further improved during this time. From 1845 the family's main house was East Horsley Towers, rebuilt in the Victorian Gothic fashion by the architect of the Houses of Parliament, Charles Barry.[27][28]\\r\\nThey had three children: Byron (born 12 May 1836); Anne Isabella (called Annabella; born 22 September 1837); and Ralph Gordon (born 2 July 1839). Immediately after the birth of Annabella, Lady King experienced \\"a tedious and suffering illness, which took months to cure.\\"[25] Ada was a descendant of the extinct Barons Lovelace and in 1838, her husband was made Earl of Lovelace and Viscount Ockham,[29] meaning Ada became the Countess of Lovelace. In 1843ÿ44, Ada's mother assigned William Benjamin Carpenter to teach Ada's children and to act as a \\"moral\\" instructor for Ada.[30] He quickly fell for her and encouraged her to express any frustrated affections, claiming that his marriage meant he would never act in an \\"unbecoming\\" manner. When it became clear that Carpenter was trying to start an affair, Ada cut it off.[31]\\r\\nIn 1841 Lovelace and Medora Leigh (the daughter of Lord Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh) were told by Ada's mother that her father was also Medora's father.[32] On 27 February 1841, Ada wrote to her mother: \\"I am not in the least astonished. In fact, you merely confirm what I have for years and years felt scarcely a doubt about, but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in any way suspected.\\"[33] She did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron, but instead blamed Augusta Leigh: \\"I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was.\\"[34] In the 1840s Ada flirted with scandals: first, from a relaxed relationship with men who were not her husband, which led to rumours of affairs[35]and secondly, her love of gambling. She apparently lost more than S3,000 on the horses during the later 1840s.[36] The gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends, and an ambitious attempt in 1851 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets. This went disastrously wrong, leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate, forcing her to admit it all to her husband.[37] She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosse's son John from 1844 onwards. John Crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement. She bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her.[38] During her final illness, she would panic at the idea of the younger Crosse being kept from visiting her.[39]\\r\\nThroughout her illnesses, she continued her education.[40] Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age. She was privately schooled in mathematics and science by William Frend, William King,[a] and Mary Somerville, the noted researcher and scientific author of the 19th century. One of her later tutors was the mathematician and logician Augustus De Morgan. From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge,[23] and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that her daughter's skill in mathematics could lead her to become \\"an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence\\".[41]\\r\\nLovelace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating poetry and science. While studying differential calculus, she wrote to De Morgan:\\r\\nI may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in one shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar[42]\\r\\nLovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts. She valued metaphysics as much as mathematics, viewing both as tools for exploring \\"the unseen worlds around us\\".[43]\\r\\nLovelace died at the age of 36?ÿ the same age that her father had died?ÿ on 27 November 1852,[44] from uterine cancer probably exacerbated by bloodletting by her physicians.[45] The illness lasted several months, in which time Annabella took command over whom Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and confidants. Under her mother's influence, she had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor.[46] She lost contact with her husband after she confessed something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. What she told him is unknown.[47] She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque in Latin to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers.\\r\\nThroughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including phrenology[48] and mesmerism.[49] After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844 she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings (\\"a calculus of the nervous system\\").[50] She never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a long-running pre-occupation, inherited from her mother, about her 'potential' madness. As part of her research into this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments.[51] In the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron Karl von Reichenbach, Researches on Magnetism, but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft.[52] In 1851, the year before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning \\"certain productions\\" she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music.[53]\\r\\nLovelace first met Charles Babbage in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his Difference Engine.[54] She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could. Babbage was impressed by Lovelace's intellect and analytic skills. He called her \\"The Enchantress of Number\\".[55][b] In 1843 he wrote to her:\\r\\nForget this world and all its troubles and if possible its multitudinous Charlatansevery thing in short but the Enchantress of Number.[55]\\r\\n During a nine-month period in 1842ÿ43, Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's article on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine. With the article, she appended a set of notes.[57] Explaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult task, as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment was uninterested in it.[58] Lovelace's notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine.[59] Her work was well received at the time; the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing.[60]\\r\\nThe notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include (in Section G[61]), in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers with the Engine, which could have run correctly had Babbage's Analytical Engine been built.[62] (Only his Difference Engine has been built, completed in London in 2002.[63]) Based on this work Lovelace is now widely considered the first computer programmer[1] and her method is recognised as the world's first computer program.[64]\\r\\nSection G also contains Lovelace's dismissal of artificial intelligence. She wrote that \\"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.\\" This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by Alan Turing in his paper \\"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\\".[65]\\r\\nLovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published when he tried to leave his own statement (a criticism of the government's treatment of his Engine) as an unsigned prefacewhich would imply that she had written that also. When Taylor's Scientific Memoirs ruled that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper. The historian Benjamin Woolley theorised that: \\"His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada's involvement, and so happily indulged her?... because of her 'celebrated name'.\\"[66] Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as Philosopher's Walk, as it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles.[60]\\r\\nIn 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his Analytical Engine. Luigi Menabrea, a young Italian engineer, and the future Prime Minister of Italy wrote up Babbage's lecture in French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the Bibliothque universelle de Genve in October 1842. Babbage's friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English. She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage. These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then published in Taylor's Scientific Memoirs under the initialism AAL.\\r\\nAda Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason.[67][68] The engine was never completed so her program was never tested.[69]\\r\\nIn 1953, more than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace's notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine were republished. The engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software.[62]\\r\\nIn her notes, Lovelace emphasised the difference between the Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines, particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity.[70] She realised the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crunching. In her notes, she wrote:\\r\\n[The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.[71][72]\\r\\nThis analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised. Walter Isaacson ascribes Lovelace's insight regarding the application of computing to any process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles: \\"When she saw some mechanical looms that used punchcards to direct the weaving of beautiful patterns, it reminded her of how Babbage's engine used punched cards to make calculations.\\"[73] This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley, as well as the programmer John Graham-Cumming, whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine.[74][75][76]\\r\\nAccording to the historian of computing and Babbage specialist Doron Swade:\\r\\nAda saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see. In Babbage's world his engines were bound by number...What Lovelace sawwhat Ada Byron sawwas that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computationto general-purpose computationand looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper.[1]\\r\\nThough Lovelace is referred to as the first computer programmer, some biographers and historians of computing claim otherwise.\\r\\nAllan G. Bromley, in the 1990 article Difference and Analytical Engines:\\r\\nAll but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Babbage from three to seven years earlier. The exception was prepared by Babbage for her, although she did detect a 'bug' in it. Not only is there no evidence that Ada ever prepared a program for the Analytical Engine, but her correspondence with Babbage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so.[77]\\r\\nBruce Collier, who later wrote a biography of Babbage, wrote in his 1970 Harvard University PhD thesis that Lovelace \\"made a considerable contribution to publicizing the Analytical Engine, but there is no evidence that she advanced the design or theory of it in any way\\".[78]\\r\\nEugene Eric Kim and Betty Alexandra Toole consider it \\"incorrect\\" to regard Lovelace as the first computer programmer, as Babbage wrote the initial programs for his Analytical Engine, although the majority were never published.[79] Bromley notes several dozen sample programs prepared by Babbage between 1837 and 1840, all substantially predating Lovelace's notes.[80] Dorothy K. Stein regards Lovelace's notes as \\"more a reflection of the mathematical uncertainty of the author, the political purposes of the inventor, and, above all, of the social and cultural context in which it was written, than a blueprint for a scientific development\\".[81]\\r\\nIn his book, Idea Makers, Stephen Wolfram defends Lovelace's contributions. While acknowledging that Babbage wrote several unpublished algorithms for the Analytical Engine prior to Lovelace's notes, Wolfram argues that \\"there's nothing as sophisticatedor as cleanas Ada's computation of the Bernoulli numbers. Babbage certainly helped and commented on Ada's work, but she was definitely the driver of it.\\" Wolfram then suggests that Lovelace's main achievement was to distill from Babbage's correspondence \\"a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machinesomething which Babbage never did.\\"[82]\\r\\nDoron Swade, a specialist on history of computing known for his work on Babbage, analyzed four claims about Lovelace during a lecture on Babbage's analytical engine:\\r\\nAccording to him, only the fourth claim had \\"any substance at all\\". He explained that Ada was only a \\"promising beginner\\" instead of genius in mathematics, that she began studying basic concepts of mathematics five years after Babbage conceived the analytical engine so she couldn't have made important contributions to it, and that she only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it. But he agrees that Ada was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities.[83]\\r\\nLovelace has been portrayed in Romulus Linney's 1977 play Childe Byron,[84] the 1990 steampunk novel The Difference Engine by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling,[85] the 1997 film Conceiving Ada,[86] and in John Crowley's 2005 novel Lord Byron's Novel: The Evening Land, where she is featured as an unseen character whose personality is forcefully depicted in her annotations and anti-heroic efforts to archive her father's lost novel.[87]\\r\\nIn Tom Stoppard's 1993 play Arcadia, the precocious teenage genius Thomasina Coverly (a character \\"apparently based\\" on Ada Lovelacethe play also involves Lord Byron) comes to understand chaos theory, and theorises the second law of thermodynamics, before either is officially recognised.[88][89] The 2015 play Ada and the Memory Engine by Lauren Gunderson portrays Lovelace and Charles Babbage in unrequited love, and it imagines a post-death meeting between Lovelace and her father.[90][91]\\r\\nLovelace and Babbage are the main characters in Sydney Padua's webcomic and graphic novel The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage. The comic features extensive footnotes on the history of Ada Lovelace, and many lines of dialogue are drawn from actual correspondence.[92]\\r\\nLovelace and Mary Shelley as teenagers are the central characters in Jordan Stratford's steampunk series, The Wollstonecraft Detective Agency.[93]\\r\\nIn 2017, a Google Doodle honoured her on International Women's Day.[94] Lovelace and Babbage appear as characters in the ITV series Victoria.[95] In September 2017, the Family Coppola launched a gin named after Ada Lovelace.[96]\\r\\nThe computer language Ada, created on behalf of the United States Department of Defense, was named after Lovelace. The reference manual for the language was approved on 10 December 1980 and the Department of Defense Military Standard for the language, MIL-STD-1815, was given the number of the year of her birth.\\r\\nSince 1998 the British Computer Society (BCS) has awarded the Lovelace Medal,[97] and in 2008 initiated an annual competition for women students.[98] BCSWomen sponsors the Lovelace Colloquium, an annual conference for women undergraduates.[98] Ada College is a further-education college in Tottenham Hale, London focused on digital skills.[99]\\r\\nAda Lovelace Day is an annual event celebrated in mid-October[100] whose goal is to \\"...?raise the profile of women in science, technology, engineering, and maths,\\" (see Women in STEM fields) and to \\"create new role models for girls and women\\" in these fields. The Ada Initiative was a non-profit organisation dedicated to increasing the involvement of women in the free culture and open source movements.[101]\\r\\nThe Engineering in Computer Science and Telecommunications College building in Zaragoza University is called the Ada Byron Building.[102] The computer centre in the village of Porlock, near where Lovelace lived, is named after her. Ada Lovelace House is a council-owned building in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, near where Lovelace spent her infancy; the building was once an internet centre[103]\\r\\nShe is also the inspiration and influence for the Ada Developers Academy in Seattle, Washington. The academy is a non-profit that seeks to increase diversity in tech by training women, trans and non-binary people to be software engineers.[104]\\r\\nOne of the tunnel boring machines excavating London's Crossrail project is named Ada.[105]\\r\\nAda: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology is an \\"open-access, multi-modal, [open-]peer-reviewed feminist journal concerned with the intersections of gender, new media, and technology\\" that began in 2012 and is run by the Fembot Collective.[106]\\r\\nThe bicentenary of Ada Lovelace's birth was celebrated with a number of events, including:[107]\\r\\nSpecial exhibitions were displayed by the Science Museum in London[111] and the Weston Library[112] (part of the Bodleian Library) in Oxford, England.","input":"Who is known as the worlds first computer programmer?"},{"output":"5 December 2009","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nMS Oasis of the Seas is an Oasis-class cruise ship owned by Royal Caribbean International. Her hull was laid down in November 2007 and she was completed and delivered to Royal Caribbean in October 2009. At the time of construction, Oasis of the Seas set a new capacity record of carrying over 6,000 passengers.[11] The first of her class, she was joined by sister ships MS?Allure of the Seas in December 2010, MS?Harmony of the Seas in May 2016, and MS?Symphony of the Seas in April 2018.  Oasis of the Seas conducts cruises of the Caribbean from her home port of Port Canaveral in Cape Canaveral, Florida.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOasis of the Seas surpassed the Freedom-class cruise ships (also owned by Royal Caribbean) to become the largest cruise ship in the world at that time.[13] She was herself surpassed by her sister ship Allure of the Seas, which is 50 millimetres (2.0?in) longer, although this may have been caused by ambient temperature differences at the times the measurements were made.[14] In May 2016, her second sister ship Harmony of the Seas became the new record holder with a length of 362.12 metres (1,188.1?ft).[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vessel was ordered in February 2006 and designed under the name \\"Project Genesis\\".[16] Her keel was laid down on 12 November 2007 by STX Europe Turku Shipyard, Finland.[4] The company announced that full funding for Oasis of the Seas was secured on 15 April 2009.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Oasis of the Seas resulted from a competition held in May 2008.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first float-out of the vessel the tugboats that were pulling the ship from its dock failed to control the ship, resulting in the port side of the ship hitting the dock. This resulted in some cosmetic damage and minor damage to the hull, which was repaired and did not affect the final delivery date of the vessel.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship was completed and turned over to Royal Caribbean on 28 October 2009. Two days later, she departed Finland for the United States.[20] While exiting the Baltic Sea, the vessel passed underneath the Great Belt Fixed Link in Denmark on 31 October 2009 at 23:18?UTC.[21][22] The bridge has a clearance of 65?m (213?ft) above the water; Oasis normally has an air draft of 72?m (236?ft). The passage under the bridge was possible due to retraction of the telescoping funnels, and an additional 30?cm (12?in) was gained by the squat effect whereby vessels traveling at speed in a shallow channel will be drawn deeper into the water.[23] Approaching the bridge at 23 knots (43?km/h; 26?mph),[22] the ship passed under it with less than 60 centimetres (2?ft) of clearance.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nProceeding through the English Channel, Oasis stopped briefly in the Solent so that 300 shipyard workers who were on board doing finishing work could disembark, then left on the way to her intended home port of Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[24] The ship arrived there on 13 November 2009, where tropical plants were installed prior to some introductory trips and her maiden voyage on 5 December 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Royal Caribbean's chief of captains William S. Wright was in command of the ship's journey across the Atlantic and also for the first few sailings, as of  2018[update] navigation of Oasis of the Seas is handled by Claus Andersen and Per Kristoffersen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOasis had a minor refit in winter 2011, adding the DreamWorks Experience which allows passengers to interact with characters, such as Shrek, on board the ship. The Oasis-class also now features 3D movies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOasis underwent a second drydock refit in October 2014.[25] During drydock the ship was modified to support Dynamic Dining, adding the suite-only \\"Coastal Kitchen\\" restaurant to the Viking Crown and dividing the main dining room into three separate restaurants: \\"American Icon Grill\\", \\"The Grande\\", and \\"Silk\\".[26][27] In addition, the Broadway-style production of Hairspray was replaced with a production of Cats.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gross tonnage of Oasis of the Seas is 225,282.[1] Her displacementthe actual mass of the vesselis estimated at approximately 100,000 metric tons (110,000 short tons), slightly less than that of an American Nimitz-class aircraft carrier.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo keep the ship stable without increasing the draft excessively, the designers created a wide hull; 9.3 metres (31?ft) of the ship sits beneath the water, a small percentage of the ship's overall height. Wide, shallow ships such as this tend to be \\"snappy\\", meaning that they can snap back upright after a wave has passed, which can be uncomfortable. This effect, however, is mitigated by the vessel's large size.[30] The cruise ship's officers were pleased with the ship's stability and performance during the transatlantic crossing, when the vessel, in order to allow finishing work to go on, slowed and changed course in the face of winds \\"almost up to hurricane force\\" and seas in excess of 12 metres (39?ft).[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship's power comes from six medium speed marine diesel generating sets: three 16-cylinder W?rtsil? 16V46D common rail engines producing 18,860 kilowatts (25,290?hp) each and three similar 12-cylinder W?rtsil? 12V46 engines producing 13,860 kilowatts (18,590?hp) each. The fuel consumption of the main engines at full power is 1,377 US gallons (5,210?l; 1,147?imp?gal) of fuel oil per engine per hour for the 16-cylinder engines and 1,033 US gallons (3,910?l; 860?imp?gal) per engine per hour for the 12-cylinder engines.[9][33] The total output of these prime movers, some 97,020 kilowatts (130,110?hp), is converted to electricity, used in hotel power for operation of the lights, elevators, electronics, galleys, water treatment plant, and all of the other systems used on the operation of the vessel, as well as propulsion. Propulsion is provided by three 20,000-kilowatt (26,800?hp) Azipods, ABB's brand of electric azimuth thrusters. These pods, suspended under the stern, contain electric motors driving 20-foot (6?m) propellers.[9] Because they are rotatable, no rudders are needed to steer the ship. Docking is assisted by four 5,500-kilowatt (7,380?hp) transverse bow thrusters.[1][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional power comes from solar panels fitted by BAM Energy Group, which provide energy for lighting in the promenade and central park areas. The installation cost US$750,000 and covers 1,950 square metres (21,000?sq?ft) on deck 19.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship carries 18 lifeboats that hold 370 people each, for a total of 6,660 people. Inflatable life rafts provide for additional passengers and crew.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nOasis of the Seas offers passengers features such as two-story loft suites and luxury suites measuring 150?m2 (1,600?sq?ft) with balconies overlooking the sea or promenades. The ship features a zip-line, a casino,[37] a miniature golf course, multiple night clubs, several bars and lounges, a karaoke club, comedy club, five swimming pools, volleyball and basketball courts, and youth zones and nurseries for children.[38] Many of the ship's interiors were extensively decorated by muralist Clarissa Parish.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnboard recreational, athletic, and entertainment activities are organized into seven themed areas called \\"neighborhoods\\",[40][41] a concept which bears resemblance to theme park planning.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship was formally named on 30 November 2009 during a charity sailing for Make-A-Wish Foundation. At this ceremony the ship was  sponsored by seven \\"godmothers\\", each representing one of the seven neighbourhoods on board.

Macon lies near the geographic center of the state, approximately 85 miles (137?km) south of Atlanta, hence the city's nickname \\"The Heart of Georgia.\\"\\r\\nLocated near the fall line of the Ocmulgee River, Macon is the county seat of Bibb County and had a 2014 estimated population of 153,691. Macon is the principal city of the Macon metropolitan area, which had an estimated population of 231,259 in 2014. Macon is also the largest city in the MaconÿWarner Robins Combined Statistical Area (CSA), a larger trading area with an estimated 417,473 residents in 2014; the CSA abuts the Atlanta metropolitan area just to the north.\\r\\nIn a 2012 referendum, voters approved the consolidation of Macon and Bibb County, and Macon became Georgia's fourth-largest city (just after Augusta). The two governments officially merged on January 1, 2014.[4]\\r\\nMacon is served by three interstate highways: I-16 (connecting the city to Savannah and coastal Georgia), I-75 (connecting the city with Atlanta to the north and Valdosta to the south), and I-475 (a city bypass highway).\\r\\nThe city has several institutions of higher education, as well as numerous museums and tourism sites. The area is served by the Middle Georgia Regional Airport and the Herbert Smart Downtown Airport. The mayor of Macon is Robert Reichert, a former Democratic member of the Georgia House of Representatives. Reichert was elected mayor of the newly consolidated city of MaconÿBibb, and he took office on January 1, 2014.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMacon lies on the site of the Ocmulgee Old Fields, where the Creek Indians lived in the 18th century. Their predecessors, the Mississippian culture, built a powerful chiefdom (950ÿ1100 AD) based on an agricultural village and constructed earthwork mounds for ceremonial, burial, and religious purposes. The areas along the rivers in the Southeast had been inhabited by varying cultures of indigenous peoples for 13,000 years before Europeans arrived.[6]\\r\\nMacon developed at the site of Fort Benjamin Hawkins, built from 1806ÿ1809 at the fall line of the Ocmulgee River to protect the community and to establish a trading post with Native Americans. The fort was named in honor of Benjamin Hawkins, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Southeast territory south of the Ohio River for more than two decades. He lived among the Creek and was married to a Creek woman. This was the most inland point of navigation on the river from the Low Country. President Thomas Jefferson forced the Creek to cede their lands east of the Ocmulgee River and ordered the fort built. (Archeological excavations in the 21st century found evidence of two separate fortifications.)[7]\\r\\nFort Hawkins guarded the Lower Creek Pathway, an extensive and well-traveled American Indian network later improved by the United States as the Federal Road from Washington, D.C., to the ports of Mobile, Alabama and New Orleans, Louisiana.[7] A gathering point of the Creek and U.S. cultures for trading, it was also a center of state militia and federal troops. The fort served as a major military distribution point during the War of 1812 against Great Britain and also during the Creek War of 1813. Afterward, the fort was used as a trading post for several years and was garrisoned until 1821. It was decommissioned about 1828 and later burned to the ground. A replica of the southeast blockhouse was built in 1938 and stands today on a hill in east Macon. Part of the fort site is occupied by the Fort Hawkins Grammar School.[7] In the twenty-first century, archeological excavations have revealed more of the fort's importance, and stimulated planning for additional reconstruction of this major historical site.\\r\\nAs many Europeans had already begun to move into the area, they renamed Fort Hawkins \\"Newtown.\\" After the organization of Bibb County in 1822, the city was chartered as the county seat in 1823 and officially named Macon. This was in honor of the North Carolina statesman Nathaniel Macon,[8] because many of the early residents of Georgia hailed from North Carolina. The city planners envisioned \\"a city within a park\\" and created a city of spacious streets and parks. They designated 250 acres (1.0?km2) for Central City Park, and passed ordinances requiring residents to plant shade trees in their front yards.\\r\\nThe city thrived due to its location on the Ocmulgee River, which enabled shipping to markets. Cotton became the mainstay of Macon's early economy, based on the enslaved labor of African Americans. Macon was in the Black Belt of Georgia, where cotton was the chief commodity crop. Cotton steamboats, stage coaches, and later, in 1843, a railroad increased marketing opportunities and contributed to the economic prosperity to Macon. In 1836, the Georgia Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church founded Wesleyan College in Macon. Wesleyan was the first college in the United States chartered to grant degrees to women.[9] In 1855, a referendum was held to determine a capital city for Georgia. Macon came in last with 3,802 votes.[10]\\r\\nDuring the American Civil War, Macon served as the official arsenal of the Confederacy. Camp Oglethorpe, in Macon, was used first as a prison for captured Union officers and enlisted men. Later it held officers only, up to 2,300 at one time. The camp was evacuated in 1864.[11]\\r\\nMacon City Hall, which served as the temporary state capitol in 1864, was converted to use as a hospital for wounded Confederate soldiers. The Union General William Tecumseh Sherman spared Macon on his march to the sea. His troops had sacked the nearby state capital of Milledgeville, and Maconites prepared for an attack. Sherman, however, passed by without entering Macon.\\r\\nThe Macon Telegraph wrote that, of the 23 companies which the city had furnished the Confederacy, only enough men survived and were fit for duty to fill five companies by the end of the war. The human toll was very high.[12]\\r\\nThe city was taken by Union forces at the end of the war during Wilson's Raid on April 20, 1865.[13]\\r\\nIn the twentieth century, Macon grew into a prospering town in Middle Georgia. It began to serve as a transportation hub for the entire state. In 1895, the New York Times dubbed Macon \\"The Central City,\\" in reference to the city's emergence as a hub for railroad transportation and textile factories.[14] Terminal Station was built in 1916.[15]\\r\\nIn 1994 Tropical Storm Alberto made landfall in Florida bringing 24 inches (61?cm) of rain, which resulted in major flooding in Georgia. Macon was one of the cities to suffer the worst flooding.[16]\\r\\nOn May 11, 2008, an EF2 tornado touched down in nearby Lizella, Georgia. The tornado then tracked northeast to the south shore of Lake Tobesofkee then continued into Macon and lifted near Dry Branch near the Twiggs County line. The tornado did not produce a continuous path, but did produce sporadic areas of major damage. Widespread straight-line wind damage was also produced along and south of the track of the tornado. The most significant damage was in the city of Macon especially along Eisenhower Parkway and Pio Nono Avenue where two businesses were destroyed and several others sustained heavy damage. Middle Georgia State College was also damaged by the tornado, snapping or uprooting around half of the campus trees and doing significant damage to several buildings on campus, with the gymnasium sustaining the worst damage. This tornado varied in intensity from EF0 to EF2 with the EF2 damage and winds up to 130 miles per hour (210?km/h) occurring near the intersection of Eisenhower Parkway and Pio Nono Avenue. Total path length was 18 miles (29?km) with a path width of 100 yards (91?m).[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2012, voters in Macon and Bibb County approved a new consolidated government between the city and county, making the city's new boundary lines the same as the county's and deannexing a small portion of the city that once lay in Jones County.[4]\\r\\nOn July 31, 2012, voters in Macon (57.8 percent approval) and Bibb County (56.7 percent approval) passed a referendum to merge the governments of the city of Macon and most of unincorporated Bibb County, based on the authorization of House Bill 1171, passed by the Georgia General Assembly earlier in the year;[17] four previous consolidation attempts (in 1933, 1960, 1972, and 1976) had failed.[18][19][20]\\r\\nUnder the consolidation, the governments of Macon and Bibb County were replaced with a single mayor and a nine-member countywide commission elected to office by county districts. A portion of Macon that extends into nearby Jones County was deincorporated from Macon. Robert Reichert is the first mayor of Macon-Bibb after the election in September 2013 and a runoff with C. Jack Ellis in October.[5][21][22][23]\\r\\nThe Ocmulgee River is the major river that runs through the city. Macon is one of Georgia's three Fall Line Cities, along with Augusta and Columbus. The Fall Line is where the hilly lands of the Piedmont plateau meet the flat terrain of the coastal plain. As such, Macon has a varied landscape of rolling hills on the north side and flat plains on the south. The fall line, where the altitude drops noticeably, causes rivers in the area to flow rapidly toward the ocean. In the past, Macon and other Fall Line cities had many textile mills powered by the rivers.\\r\\nMacon is located at 325005N 833906W? / ?32.834839N 83.651672W? / 32.834839; -83.651672 (32.834839, ?83.651672).[53]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 56.3 square miles (146?km2), of which 55.8 square miles (145?km2) is land and 0.5 square miles (1.3?km2) (0.82%) is water.\\r\\nMacon is approximately 330 feet (100?m) above sea level.[3]\\r\\nMacon has a humid subtropical climate (K?ppen climate classification Cfa).

The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit ('Hayward')[3] is oval, about the size of a large hen's egg (5ÿ8?cm (2.0ÿ3.1?in) in length and 4.5ÿ5.5?cm (1.8ÿ2.2?in) in diameter). It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin and bright green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft texture and a sweet but unique flavor. It is a commercial crop in several countries, such as China, Italy, New Zealand, Chile, Greece, and France.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly varieties were described in a 1904 nurseryman's catalogue as having \\"...edible fruits the size of walnuts, and the flavour of ripe gooseberries\\",[5] and Europeans called it Chinese gooseberry.[1] In 1962, New Zealand growers began calling it \\"kiwifruit\\" for export marketing, a name becoming commercially adopted in 1974.[1] The word kiwifruit and the shortened kiwi, have been used since around 1966, when the fruit was first imported from New Zealand to the United States.[6][7] Kiwifruit has since become a common name for all commercially grown fruit from the genus Actinidia.[1][8] In New Zealand, the shortened word, \\"kiwi\\", is seldom used to refer to the fruit, as it usually refers to the kiwi bird or the Kiwi people.[6][7]\\r\\nKiwifruit is native to north-central and eastern China.[1] The first recorded description of the kiwifruit dates back to the 12th century China during the Song dynasty.[9] Cultivation of the fuzzy kiwifruit spread from China in the early 20th century to New Zealand, where the first commercial plantings occurred.[1] Although kiwifruit is a national fruit of China, until recently, China was not a major producing country of kiwifruit, as it was traditionally collected from the wild.[10] The fruit became popular with American servicemen stationed in New Zealand during World War II and later exported to California using the names \\"Chinese gooseberry\\" and \\"melonette\\".[1][7] In 1962, New Zealand growers began calling it \\"kiwifruit\\" to give it more market appeal, and a California-based importer named Frieda Caplan subsequently used that name when introducing the fruit to the American market.[1][9]\\r\\nIn Italy, kiwifruit cultivation began in 1970, growing to rank second in production behind China in 2014.[11]\\r\\nThe genus Actinidia contains around 60 species. Though most kiwifruit are easily recognized as kiwifruit (due to basic shape) their fruit is quite variable. The skin of the fruit varies in size, shape, hairiness, and color. The flesh varies in color, juiciness, texture, and taste. Some fruits are unpalatable while others taste considerably better than the majority of the commercial varieties.[1][14]\\r\\nThe most common kiwifruit is the fuzzy kiwifruit, from the species A. deliciosa. Other species that are commonly eaten include golden kiwifruit (A. chinensis), Chinese egg gooseberry (A. coriacea), hardy kiwifruit (A. arguta), Arctic kiwifruit (A. kolomikta), purple kiwifruit (A. melanandra), silver vine (A. polygama), hearty red kiwifruit (A. purpurea).[14]\\r\\nAlmost all kiwifruit sold belong to a few cultivars of fuzzy kiwi (Actinidia deliciosa): 'Hayward', 'Blake', and 'Saanichton 12'.[2] They have a fuzzy, dull-brown skin, and bright-green flesh. The familiar cultivar 'Hayward' was developed by Hayward Wright in Avondale, New Zealand, around 1924.[14] It was initially grown in domestic gardens, but commercial planting began in the 1940s.\\r\\n'Hayward' is the most commonly available cultivar in stores. It is a large, egg-shaped fruit with a sweet flavor. 'Saanichton 12', from British Columbia, is somewhat more rectangular than 'Hayward' and comparably sweet, but the inner core of the fruit can be tough. 'Blake' can self-pollinate, but it has a smaller, more oval fruit and the flavor is considered inferior.[2][14]\\r\\nKiwi berries are edible berry- or grape-sized fruits similar to the fuzzy kiwifruit in taste and appearance, but with thin, smooth green skin. They are primarily produced by three species of kiwifruit; hardy kiwi (Actinidia arguta), Arctic beauty (A. kolomikta), and silver vine (A. polygama). They are fast-growing, climbing vines, durable over their growing season. They are referred to as kiwi berry, baby kiwi, dessert kiwi, grape kiwi, or cocktail kiwi.[15]\\r\\nThe cultivar 'Issai' is a hybrid of hardy kiwi and silver vine which can self-pollinate. Grown commercially because of its relatively large fruit, Issai is less hardy than most hardy kiwi.[16][17]\\r\\nThe golden kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) has a smooth, bronze skin, with a beak shape at the stem attachment. Flesh color varies from bright green to a clear, intense yellow. This species is sweeter and more aromatic in flavor; the flavor is reminiscent of some subtropical fruit. Its short storage life currently limits its commercial potential.[citation needed] One of the most attractive varieties has a red 'iris' around the center of the fruit and yellow flesh outside. The yellow fruit fetches a higher market price and, being less hairy than the fuzzy kiwifruit, is more palatable for consumption without peeling.[14]\\r\\nA commercially viable[18] variety of this red-ringed kiwifruit, patented as the EnzaRed?, is a cultivar of the Chinese hong yang variety.[12][13]\\r\\nHort16A is a golden kiwifruit marketed worldwide in decreasing volumes because this variety suffered significant losses in New Zealand from late 2010 to 2013 due to the PSA bacterium.[19] A new variety of golden kiwifruit, 'Gold3', has been found to be more disease-resistant and most growers have now grafted over to this variety.[20] The Gold3 variety, marketed by Zespri as 'SunGold', is not quite as sweet as the previous Hort16A, with a hint of tanginess,[21] and lacks the Hort16A's usually slightly pointy tip.\\r\\nKiwifruit can be grown in most temperate climates with adequate summer heat. Where fuzzy kiwifruit (A. deliciosa) is not hardy, other species can be grown as substitutes.\\r\\nOften in commercial farming, different breeds are used for rootstock, fruit bearing plants, and pollinators.[1] Therefore, the seeds produced are crossbreeds of their parents. Even if the same breeds are used for pollinators and fruit bearing plants, there is no guarantee that the fruit will have the same quality as the parent. Additionally, seedlings take seven years before they flower, so determining whether the kiwi is fruit bearing or a pollinator is time consuming.[22] Therefore, most kiwifruits, with the exception of rootstock and new cultivars, are propagated asexually.[22] This is done by grafting the fruit producing plant onto rootstock grown from seedlings or, if the plant is desired to be a true cultivar, rootstock grown from cuttings of a mature plant.[22]\\r\\nMost of the plants require a male plant to pollinate a female plant for the female plant to produce fruit (dioecious). For a good yield of fruit, one male vine for every three to eight female vines is required.[1] Other varieties can self pollinate, but they produce a greater and more reliable yield when pollinated by male kiwifruit vines.[1]\\r\\nKiwifruit is notoriously difficult to pollinate, because the flowers are not very attractive to bees. Some producers blow collected pollen over the female flowers. Generally, the most successful approach, though, is saturation pollination, where the bee populations are made so large (by placing hives in the orchards at a concentration of about 8 hives per hectare) that bees are forced to use this flower because of intense competition for all flowers within flight distance.[1] This is also increased by using varieties specifically developed for pollination.[1]\\r\\nKiwifruit is picked by hand, and commercially grown on sturdy support structures, as it can produce several tonnes per hectare, more than the rather weak vines can support. These are generally equipped with a watering system for irrigation and frost protection in the spring.\\r\\nKiwifruit vines require vigorous pruning, similar to that of grapevines. Fruit is borne on one-year-old and older canes, but production declines as each cane ages. Canes should be pruned off and replaced after their third year. In the northern hemisphere the fruit ripens in November, while in the southern it ripens in May. Four year-old plants can produce up to 14,000 lbs per acre while Eight year-old plants can produce 18,000 lbs per acre. The plants produce their maximum at 8 to 10 years old. The seasonal yields are variable, a heavy crop on a vine one season generally comes with a light crop the following season.[1]\\r\\nFruits harvested when firm will ripen when stored properly for long periods. This allows fruit to be sent to market up to 8 weeks after harvest.[1]\\r\\nFirm kiwifruit ripen after a few days to a week when stored at room temperature, but should not be kept in direct sunlight. Faster ripening occurs when placed in a paper bag with an apple, pear, or banana.[23] Once a kiwifruit is ripe, however, it is preserved optimally when stored far from other fruits, as it is very sensitive to the ethylene gas they may emit, thereby tending to over-ripen even in the refrigerator.[23] If stored appropriately, ripe kiwifruit normally keep for about one to two weeks.[23]\\r\\nPseudomonas syringae actinidiae (PSA) was first identified in Japan in the 1980s. This bacterial strain has been controlled and managed successfully in orchards in Asia. In 1992, it was found in northern Italy. In 2007/2008, economic losses were observed, as a more virulent strain became more dominant (PSA V).[24][25][26] In 2010 it was found in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty kiwifruit orchards in the North Island.[27]\\r\\nScientists reported they had worked out the strain of PSA affecting kiwifruit from New Zealand, Italy, and Chile originated in China.[28]\\r\\nChina is the largest producer of kiwifruit, growing almost five times as much as second-placed Italy in 2016. Other major producers include New Zealand, Chile and Greece.\\r\\nKiwifruit exports rapidly increased from the late 1960s to early 1970s in New Zealand. By 1976, exports exceeded the amount consumed domestically.[30] Outside of Australasia, all New Zealand kiwifruits are now marketed under the brand-name label Zespri.[31]\\r\\nIn the 1980s, countries outside New Zealand began to export kiwifruit.[32] In Italy, the infrastructure and techniques required to support grape production were adapted to the kiwifruit. This, coupled with being very close to the European kiwifruit market, led to Italians becoming the leading producer of kiwifruit in the early 2000s. The growing season of Italian kiwifruit does not overlap much with the New Zealand or the Chilean growing seasons, therefore direct competition between New Zealand or Chile was not much of a factor.[33]\\r\\nAlthough kiwifruit is a national fruit of China, until recently, China was not a major producing country of kiwifruit until lately, as it was traditionally collected from the wild.[10] In China, it is grown mainly in the mountainous area upstream of the Yangtze River, as well as Sichuan.[34]\\r\\nKiwifruit may be eaten raw, made into juices, used in baked goods, prepared with meat or used as a garnish.[1] The whole fruit, including the skin, is suitable for human consumption; however, the skin is often discarded due to its texture.[citation needed] Sliced kiwifruit has long been used as a garnish atop whipped cream on pavlova, a meringue-based dessert. Traditionally in China, kiwifruit was not eaten for pleasure, but was given as medicine to children to help them grow and to women who have given birth to help them recover.[1]\\r\\nRaw kiwifruit contains actinidain (also spelled actinidin) which is commercially useful as a meat tenderizer[35] and possibly as a digestive aid.[36] Actinidain also makes raw kiwifruit unsuitable for use in desserts containing milk or any other dairy products because the enzyme digests milk proteins. This applies to gelatin-based desserts, as well, as the actinidain will dissolve the proteins in gelatin, either liquefying the dessert or preventing it from solidifying.\\r\\nIn a 100-gram amount, green kiwifruit provides 61 calories, is 83% water and 15% carbohydrates, with negligible protein and fat (table). It is particularly rich (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) in vitamin C (112% DV) and vitamin K (38% DV), has a moderate content of vitamin E (10% DV), with no other micronutrients in significant content. Gold kiwifruit has similar nutritional value, although only vitamin C has high content in a 100 gram amount (194% DV, table).\\r\\nKiwifruit seed oil contains on average 62% alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid.[37] Kiwifruit pulp contains carotenoids, such as provitamin A beta-carotene,[38] lutein, and zeaxanthin.[39]\\r\\nThe actinidain found in kiwifruit can be an allergen for some individuals, including children.[40][41][42] The most common symptoms are unpleasant itching and soreness of the mouth, with wheezing as the most common severe symptom; anaphylaxis may occur.[40][41]\\r\\n Data related to Actinidia at Wikispecies","input":"What was named first the kiwi bird or fruit?"},{"output":"Crepuscular rays","context":"Crepuscular rays /kr??p?skj?l?r/ (more commonly known as sunbeams, sun rays,), in atmospheric optics, are rays of sunlight that appear to radiate from the point in the sky where the sun is located. These rays, which stream through gaps in clouds (particularly stratocumulus) or between other objects, are columns of sunlit air separated by darker cloud-shadowed regions. Despite seeming to converge at a point, the rays are in fact near-parallel shafts of sunlight. Their apparent convergence is a perspective effect,[citation needed] similar, for example, to the way that parallel railway lines seem to converge at a point in the distance.\\r\\nThe name comes from their frequent occurrences during twilight hours (those around dawn and dusk), when the contrasts between light and dark are the most obvious.

Czech is closely related to Slovak, to the point of mutual intelligibility to a very high degree.[8] Like other Slavic languages, Czech is a fusional language with a rich system of morphology and relatively flexible word order. Its vocabulary has been extensively influenced by Latin[9] and German.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CzechÿSlovak group developed within West Slavic in the high medieval period, and the standardization of Czech and Slovak within the CzechÿSlovak dialect continuum emerged in the early modern period. In the later 18th to mid-19th century, the modern written standard became codified in the context of the Czech National Revival. The main vernacular, known as Common Czech, is based on the vernacular of Prague, but is now spoken throughout most of the Czech Republic. The Moravian dialects spoken in the eastern part of the country are also classified as Czech, although some of their eastern variants are closer to Slovak.\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech has a moderately-sized phoneme inventory, comprising ten monophthongs, three diphthongs and 25 consonants (divided into \\"hard\\", \\"neutral\\" and \\"soft\\" categories). Words may contain complicated consonant clusters or lack vowels altogether. Czech has a raised alveolar trill, which is not known to occur as a phoneme in any other language, represented by the grapheme ?. Czech uses a simple orthography which phonologists have used as a model.\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech is a member of the West Slavic sub-branch of the Slavic branch of the Indo-European language family. This branch includes Polish, Kashubian, Upper and Lower Sorbian and Slovak. Slovak is the closest language genetic neighbor of Czech, followed by Polish and Silesian.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe West Slavic languages are spoken in Central Europe. Czech is distinguished from other West Slavic languages by a more-restricted distinction between \\"hard\\" and \\"soft\\" consonants (see Phonology below).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"Old Czech\\" is applied to the period predating the 16th century, with the earliest records of the high medieval period also classified as \\"early Old Czech\\", but the term \\"Medieval Czech\\" is also used.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the 7th century, the  Slavic expansion reached Central Europe, settling on the eastern fringes of the Frankish Empire. The West Slavic polity of  Great Moravia formed by the 9th century. The Christianization of Bohemia took place during the 9th and 10th centuries. The diversification of the Czech-Slovak group within West Slavic began around that time, marked among other things by  its ephemeral use of the voiced velar fricative consonant (/?/)[12] and consistent stress on the first syllable.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bohemian (Czech) language is first recorded in writing in glosses and short notes during the 12th to 13th centuries. Literary works written in Czech appear in the early 14th century and administrative documents first appear towards the late 14th century. The first complete Bible translation also dates to this period.[14] Old Czech texts, including poetry and cookbooks, were produced outside the university as well.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nLiterary activity becomes widespread in the early 15th century in the context of the Bohemian Reformation. Jan Hus contributed significantly to the standardization of Czech orthography, advocated for widespread literacy among Czech commoners (particularly in religion) and made early efforts to model written Czech after the spoken language.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no standardization distinguishing between Czech and Slovak prior to the 15th century.[16] In the 16th century, the division between Czech and Slovak becomes apparent, marking the confessional division between Lutheran Protestants in Slovakia using Czech orthography and Catholics, especially Slovak Jesuits, beginning to use a separate Slovak orthography based on the language of the Trnava region.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe publication of the Kralice Bible between 1579 and 1593 (the first complete Czech translation of the Bible from the original languages) became very important for standardization of the Czech language in the following centuries.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1615, the Bohemian diet tried to declare Czech to be the only official language of the kingdom. After the Bohemian Revolt (of predominantly Protestant aristocracy) which was defeated by the Habsburgs in 1620, the Protestant intellectuals had to leave the country. This emigration together with other consequences of the Thirty Years' War had a negative impact on the further use of the Czech language. In 1627, Czech and German became official languages of the Kingdom of Bohemia and in the 18th century German became dominant in Bohemia and Moravia, especially among the upper classes.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern standard Czech language originates in standardization efforts of the 18th century.[18] By then the language had developed a literary tradition, and since then it has changed little; journals from that period have no substantial differences from modern standard Czech, and contemporary Czechs can understand them with little difficulty.[19] Changes include the morphological shift of  to ej and  to  (although  survives for some uses) and the merging of  and the former ej.[20] Sometime before the 18th century, the Czech language abandoned a distinction between phonemic /l/ and /?/ which survives in Slovak.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the beginning of the national revival of the mid-18th century,  Czech historians began to emphasize their people's accomplishments from the 15th through the 17th centuries, rebelling against the Counter-Reformation (the Habsburg re-catholization efforts which had denigrated Czech and other non-Latin languages).[22] Czech philologists studied sixteenth-century texts, advocating the return of the language to high culture.[23] This period is known as the Czech National Revival[24] (or Renaissance).[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the national revival, in 1809 linguist and historian Josef Dobrovsky released a German-language grammar of Old Czech entitled Ausfhrliches Lehrgeb?ude der b?hmischen Sprache (Comprehensive Doctrine of the Bohemian Language). Dobrovsky had intended his book to be descriptive, and did not think Czech had a realistic chance of returning as a major language. However, Josef Jungmann and other revivalists used Dobrovsky's book to advocate for a Czech linguistic revival.[24] Changes during this time included spelling reform (notably,  in place of the former j and j in place of g), the use of t (rather than ti) to end infinitive verbs and the non-capitalization of nouns (which had been a late borrowing from German).[21] These changes differentiated Czech from Slovak.[25] Modern scholars disagree about whether the conservative revivalists were motivated by nationalism or considered contemporary spoken Czech unsuitable for formal, widespread use.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdherence to historical patterns was later relaxed and standard Czech adopted a number of features from Common Czech (a widespread, informal register), such as leaving some proper nouns undeclined. This has resulted in a relatively high level of homogeneity among all varieties of the language.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005 and 2007, Czech was spoken by about 10 million residents of the Czech Republic.[17][27] A Eurobarometer survey conducted from January to March 2012 found that the first language of 98 percent of Czech citizens was Czech, the third-highest in the European Union (behind Greece and Hungary).[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech, the official language of the Czech Republic (a member of the European Union since 2004), is one of the EU's official languages and the 2012 Eurobarometer survey found that Czech was the foreign language most often used in Slovakia.[28] Economist Jonathan van Parys collected data on language knowledge in Europe for the 2012 European Day of Languages. The five countries with the greatest use of Czech were the Czech Republic (98.77 percent), Slovakia (24.86 percent), Portugal (1.93 percent), Poland (0.98 percent) and Germany (0.47 percent).[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech speakers in Slovakia primarily live in cities. Since it is a recognised minority language in Slovakia, Slovak citizens who speak only Czech may communicate with the government in their language to the extent that Slovak speakers in the Czech Republic may do so.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nImmigration of Czechs from Europe to the United States occurred primarily from 1848 to 1914. Czech is a Less Commonly Taught Language in U.S. schools, and is taught at Czech heritage centers. Large communities of Czech Americans live in the states of Texas, Nebraska and Wisconsin.[31] In the 2000 United States Census, Czech was reported as the most-common language spoken at home (besides English) in Valley, Butler and Saunders Counties, Nebraska and Republic County, Kansas. With the exception of Spanish (the non-English language most commonly spoken at home nationwide), Czech was the most-common home language in over a dozen additional counties in Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, North Dakota and Minnesota.[32] As of 2009, 70,500 Americans spoke Czech as their first language (49th place nationwide, behind Turkish and ahead of Swedish).[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern written standard is directly based on the standardization during the Czech National Revival in the 1830s, significantly influenced by  Josef Jungmann's CzechÿGerman dictionary published during 1834ÿ1839. Jungmann used vocabulary of the Bible of Kralice (1579ÿ1613) period and of the language used by his contemporaries. He borrowed words not present in Czech from other Slavic languages or created neologisms.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nStandard Czech contains ten basic vowel phonemes, and three more found only in loanwords. They are /a/, /?/, /?/, /o/, and /u/, their long counterparts /a?/, /??/, /i?/, /o?/ and /u?/, and three diphthongs, /ou?/, /au?/ and /?u?/. The latter two diphthongs and the long /o?/ are exclusive to loanwords.[35] Vowels are never reduced to schwa sounds when unstressed.[36] Each word usually has primary stress on its first syllable, except for enclitics (minor, monosyllabic, unstressed syllables). In all words of more than two syllables, every odd-numbered syllable receives secondary stress. Stress is unrelated to vowel length, and the possibility of stressed short vowels and unstressed long vowels can be confusing to students whose native language combines the features (such as English).[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nVoiced consonants with unvoiced counterparts are unvoiced at the end of a word before a pause, and in consonant clusters voicing assimilation occurs, which matches voicing to the following consonant. The unvoiced counterpart of /?/ is /x/.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech consonants are categorized as \\"hard\\", \\"neutral\\" or \\"soft\\":\\r\\n\\r\\nThis distinction describes the declension patterns of nouns, which is based on the category of a noun's ending consonant. Hard consonants may not be followed by i or  in writing, or soft ones by y or y (except in loanwords such as kilogram).[39] Neutral consonants may take either character. Hard consonants are sometimes known as \\"strong\\", and soft ones as \\"weak\\".[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phoneme represented by the letter ? (capital ?) is considered unique to Czech.[41] It represents the raised alveolar non-sonorant trill (IPA: [r?]), a sound somewhere between Czech's r and ? (example: ?\\"?eka\\" (river)?(help{info)),[41] and is present in Dvo?k. In unvoiced environments, /r?/ is realized as its voiceless allophone [r??].[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consonants /r/ and /l/ can be syllabic, acting as syllable nuclei in place of a vowel. Str? prst skrz krk (\\"Stick [your] finger through [your] throat\\") is a well-known Czech tongue twister using only syllabic consonants.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConsonants\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVowels\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSlavic grammar is fusional; its nouns, verbs, and adjectives are inflected by phonological processes to modify their meanings and grammatical functions, and the easily separable affixes characteristic of agglutinative languages are limited.[44] \\r\\nSlavic inflection is complex and pervasive, inflecting for case, gender and number in nouns and tense, aspect, mood, person and subject number and gender in verbs.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nParts of speech include adjectives, adverbs, numbers, interrogative words, prepositions, conjunctions and interjections.[46] Adverbs are primarily formed from adjectives by taking the final y or  of the base form and replacing it with e, , or o.[47] Negative statements are formed by adding the affix ne- to the verb of a clause, with one exception: je (he, she or it is) becomes nen.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause Czech uses grammatical case to convey word function in a sentence (instead of relying on word order, as English does), its word order is flexible. As a pro-drop language, in Czech an intransitive sentence can consist of only a verb; information about its subject is encoded in the verb.[49] Enclitics (primarily auxiliary verbs and pronouns) must appear in the second syntactic slot of a sentence, after the first stressed unit. The first slot must contain a subject and object, a main form of a verb, an adverb or a conjunction (except for the light conjunctions a, \\"and\\", i, \\"and even\\" or ale, \\"but\\").[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech syntax has a subjectÿverbÿobject sentence structure. In practice, however, word order is flexible and used for topicalization and focus. Although Czech has a periphrastic passive construction (like English), colloquial word-order changes frequently produce the passive voice. For example, to change \\"Peter killed\\r\\nPaul\\" to \\"Paul was killed by Peter\\" the order of subject and object is inverted: Petr zabil Pavla (\\"Peter killed Paul\\") becomes \\"Paul, Peter killed\\" (Pavla zabil Petr). Pavla is in the accusative case, the grammatical object (in this case, the victim) of the verb.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nA word at the end of a clause is typically emphasized, unless an upward intonation indicates that the sentence is a question:[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn portions of Bohemia (including Prague), questions such as J pes bagetu? without an interrogative word (such as co, \\"what\\" or kdo, \\"who\\") are intoned in a slow rise from low to high, quickly dropping to low on the last word or phrase.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn modern Czech syntax, adjectives precede nouns,[54] with few exceptions.[55] Relative clauses are introduced by relativizers such as the adjective ktery, analogous to the English relative pronouns \\"which\\", \\"that\\", \\"who\\" and \\"whom\\". As with other adjectives, it is declined into the appropriate case (see Declension below) to match its associated noun, person and number. Relative clauses follow the noun they modify, and the following is a glossed example:[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish: I want to visit the university that John attends.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Czech, nouns and adjectives are declined into one of seven grammatical cases. Nouns are inflected to indicate their use in a sentence. A nominativeÿaccusative language, Czech marks subject nouns with nominative case and object nouns with accusative case. The genitive case marks possessive nouns and some types of movement. The remaining cases (instrumental, locative, vocative and dative) indicate semantic relationships, such as secondary objects, movement or position (dative case) and accompaniment (instrumental case). An adjective's case agrees with that of the noun it describes. When Czech children learn their language's declension patterns, the cases are referred to by number:[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Czech grammatical texts order the cases differently, grouping the nominative and accusative (and the dative and locative) together because those declension patterns are often identical; this order accommodates learners with experience in other inflected languages, such as Latin or Russian. This order is nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental and vocative.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome prepositions require the nouns they modify to take a particular case. The cases assigned by each preposition are based on the physical (or metaphorical) direction, or location, conveyed by it. For example, od (from, away from) and z (out of, off) assign the genitive case. Other prepositions take one of several cases, with their meaning dependent on the case; na means \\"onto\\" or \\"for\\" with the accusative case, but \\"on\\" with the locative.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples of declension patterns (using prepositions) for a few nouns with adjectives follow. Only one plural example is given, since plural declension patterns are similar across genders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a glossed example of a sentence using several cases:\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish: I carried the box into the house with my friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech distinguishes three gendersmasculine, feminine, and neuterand the masculine gender is subdivided into animate and inanimate. With few exceptions, feminine nouns in the nominative case end in -a, -e, or consonant; neuter nouns in -o, -e, or -, and masculine nouns in a consonant.[59] Adjectives agree in gender and animacy (for masculine nouns in the accusative or genitive singular and the nominative plural) with the nouns they modify.[60] The main effect of gender in Czech is the difference in noun and adjective declension, but other effects include past-tense verb endings: for example, dlal (he did, or made); dlala (she did, or made) and dlalo (it did, or made).[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nNouns are also inflected for number, distinguishing between singular and plural. Typical of a Slavic language, Czech cardinal numbers one through four allow the nouns and adjectives they modify to take any case, but numbers over five place these nouns and adjectives in the genitive case when the entire expression is in nominative or accusative case. The Czech koruna is an example of this feature; it is shown here as the subject of a hypothetical sentence, and declined as genitive for numbers five and up.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerical words decline for case and, for numbers one and two, for gender. Numbers one through five are shown below as examples, and have some of the most exceptions among Czech numbers. The number one has declension patterns identical to those of the demonstrative pronoun, to.[63][64]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Czech's grammatical numbers are singular and plural, several residuals of dual forms remain. Some nouns for paired body parts use a historical dual form to express plural in some cases: ruka (hand)ruce (nominative); noha (leg)nohama (instrumental), nohou (genitive/locative); oko (eye)o?i, and ucho (ear)u?i. While two of these nouns are neuter in their singular forms, all plural forms are considered feminine; their gender is relevant to their associated adjectives and verbs.[65] These forms are plural semantically, used for any non-singular count, as in mezi ?ty?ma o?ima (face to face, lit. among four eyes). The plural number paradigms of these nouns are actually a mixture of historical dual and plural forms. For example, nohy (legs; nominative/accusative) is a standard plural form of this type of noun.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech verb conjugation is less complex than noun and adjective declension because it codes for fewer categories. Verbs agree with their subjects in person (first, second or third) and number (singular or plural), and are  conjugated for tense (past, present or future). For example, the conjugated verb mluvme (we speak) is in the present tense and first-person plural; it is distinguished from other conjugations of the infinitive mluvit by its ending, -me.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nTypical of Slavic languages, Czech marks its verbs for one of two grammatical aspects: perfective and imperfective. Most verbs are part of inflected aspect pairsfor example, koupit (perfective) and kupovat (imperfective). Although the verbs' meaning is similar, in perfective verbs the action is completed and in imperfective verbs it is ongoing. This is distinct from past and present tense,[68] and any Czech verb of either aspect can be conjugated into any of its three tenses.[67] Aspect describes the state of the action at the time specified by the tense.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix. In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefixfor example, the imperfective pst (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective napsat (to write down, to finish writing). The most common prefixes are na-, o-, po-, s-, u-, vy-, z- and za-.[69] In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs koupit (to buy) and prodat (to sell) have the imperfective forms kupovat and prodvat.[70] Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and frequentative forms), denoting repeated or regular action. The verb jt (to go) has the iterative form chodit (to go repeatedly) and the frequentative form chodvat (to go regularly).[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany verbs have only one aspect, and verbs describing continual states of beingbyt (to be), chtt (to want), moct (to be able to), le?et (to lie down, to be lying down)have no perfective form. Conversely, verbs describing immediate states of changefor example, othotnt (to become pregnant) and nadchnout se (to become enthusiastic)have no imperfective aspect.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Czech's use of present and future tense is largely similar to that of English, the language uses past tense to represent the English present perfect and past perfect; ona b?ela could mean she ran, she has run or she had run.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some contexts, Czech's perfective present (which differs from the English present perfect) implies future action; in others, it connotes habitual action.[74] As a result, the language has a proper future tense to minimize ambiguity. The future tense does not involve conjugating the verb describing an action to be undertaken in the future; instead, the future form of byt (as shown in the table at left) is placed before the infinitive (for example, budu jst\\"I will eat\\").[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis conjugation is not followed by byt itself, so future-oriented expressions involving nouns, adjectives, or prepositions (rather than verbs) omit byt. \\"I will be happy\\" is translated as Budu ??astny (not Budu byt ??astny).[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe infinitive form ends in t (archaically, ti). It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs (for example, m??u t sly?et\\"I can hear you\\").[76] Czech verbs have three grammatical moods: indicative, imperative and conditional.[77] The imperative mood adds specific endings for each of three person (or number) categories: -?/-i/-ej for second-person singular, -te/-ete/-ejte for second-person plural and -me/-eme/-ejme for first-person plural.[78] The conditional mood is formed with a particle after the past-tense verb. This mood indicates possible events, expressed in English as \\"I would\\" or \\"I wish\\".[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Czech verbs fall into one of five classes, which determine their conjugation patterns. The future tense of byt would be classified as a Class I verb because of its endings. Examples of the present tense of each class and some common irregular verbs follow in the tables below:[80]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech has one of the most phonemic orthographies of all European languages. Its thirty-one graphemes represent thirty sounds (in most dialects, i and y have the same sound), and it contains only one digraph: ch, which follows h in the alphabet.[81] As a result, some of its characters have been used by phonologists to denote corresponding sounds in other languages. The characters q, w and x appear only in foreign words.[82] The h?ek () is used with certain letters to form new characters: ?, ?, and ?, as well as , , ?, ?, and ? (the latter five uncommon outside Czech). The last two letters are sometimes written with a comma above (?, an abbreviated h?ek) because of their height.[83] The character ܇ exists only in loanwords and onomatopoeia.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike most European languages, Czech distinguishes vowel length; long vowels are indicated by an acute accent or, occasionally with ?, a ring. Long u is usually written ~ at the beginning of a word or morpheme (~roda, ne~rodny) and ? elsewhere,[85] except for loanwords (sk~tr) or onomatopoeia (b~).[86] Long vowels and  are not considered separate letters in the alphabetical order.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech typographical features not associated with phonetics generally resemble those of most Latin European languages, including English. Proper nouns, honorifics, and the first letters of quotations are capitalized, and punctuation is typical of other Latin European languages. Writing of ordinal numerals is similar to most European languages. The Czech language uses a decimal comma instead of a decimal point. When writing a long number, spaces between every three numbers (e.g. between hundreds and thousands) may be used for better orientation in handwritten texts, but not in decimal places, like in English. The number 1,234,567.8910 may be written as 1234567,8910 or 1 234 567,8910. Ordinal numbers (1st) use a point as in German (1.). In proper noun phrases (except personal names), only the first word is capitalized (Pra?sky hrad, Prague Castle).[88][89]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main vernacular of Bohemia is \\"Common Czech\\", based on the dialect of the Prague region.\\r\\nOther Bohemian dialects have become marginalized, while Moravian dialects remain more widespread, with a political movement for Moravian linguistic revival active since the 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main Czech vernacular, spoken primarily in and around Prague but also throughout the country, is known as Common Czech (obecn ?e?tina). This is an academic distinction; most Czechs are unaware of the term or associate it with vernacular (or incorrect) Czech.[90] Compared to standard Czech, Common Czech is characterized by simpler inflection patterns and differences in sound distribution.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommon Czech has become ubiquitous in most parts of the Czech Republic since the later 20th century. It is usually defined as an interdialect used in common speech in Bohemia and western parts of Moravia (by about two thirds of all inhabitants of the Czech Republic). Common Czech is not codified, but some of its elements have become adopted in the written standard. \\r\\nSince the second half of the 20th century, Common Czech elements have also been spreading to regions previously unaffected, as a consequence of media influence.\\r\\nStandard Czech is still the norm for politicians, businesspeople and other Czechs in formal situations, but Common Czech is gaining ground in journalism and the mass media.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommon Czech is characterized by quite regular differences from the standard morphology and phonology. These variations are more or less common among all Common Czech speakers:[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nExample of declension (with the comparison with the standard Czech):\\r\\n\\r\\nmlady ?lovk ÿ young man/person, mlad lid ÿ young people, mlady stt ÿ young state, mlad ?ena ÿ young woman, mlad zv?e ÿ young animal\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from the Common Czech vernacular, there remain a variety of other Bohemian dialects, mostly in marginal rural areas. Dialect use began to weaken in the second half of the 20th century, and by the early 1990s regional dialect use was stigmatized, associated with the shrinking lower class and used in literature or other media for comedic effect. Increased travel and media availability to dialect-speaking populations has encouraged them to shift to (or add to their own dialect) standard Czech.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Czech Statistical Office in 2003 recognized the following Bohemian dialects:[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nBohemian dialects use a slightly different set of vowel phonemes to standard Czech. The phoneme /??/ is peripheral and is replaced by /i?/, and a second native diphthong /e??/ occurs, usually in places where standard Czech has /i?/.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Czech dialects spoken in Moravia and Silesia are known as Moravian (morav?tina). In the Austro-Hungarian Empire, \\"Bohemian-Moravian-Slovak\\" was a language citizens could register as speaking (with German, Polish and several others).[97] Of the Czech dialects, only Moravian is distinguished in nationwide surveys by the Czech Statistical Office. As of 2011, 62,908 Czech citizens spoke Moravian as their first language and 45,561 were diglossal (speaking Moravian and standard Czech as first languages).[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in the sixteenth century, some varieties of Czech resembled Slovak;[16] the southeastern Moravian dialects, in particular, are sometimes considered dialects of Slovak rather than Czech. These dialects form a continuum between the Czech and Slovak languages,[99] using the same declension patterns for nouns and pronouns and the same verb conjugations as Slovak.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Czech Statistical Office in 2003 recognized the following Moravian dialects:[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 1964 textbook on Czech dialectology, B?etislav Koudela used the following sentence to highlight phonetic differences between dialects:[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech and Slovak have been considered mutually intelligible; speakers of either language can communicate with greater ease than those of any other pair of West Slavic languages. Since the 1993 dissolution of Czechoslovakia, mutual intelligibility has declined for younger speakers, probably because Czech speakers now experience less exposure to Slovak and vice versa.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn phonetic differences, Czech is characterized by a glottal stop before initial vowels and Slovak by its less-frequent use of long vowels than Czech;[103] however, Slovak has long forms of the consonants r and l when they function as vowels.[104] Phonemic differences between the two languages are generally consistent, typical of two dialects of a language. Grammatically, although Czech (unlike Slovak) has a fully productive vocative case,[103] both languages share a common syntax.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne study showed that Czech and Slovak lexicons differed by 80 percent, but this high percentage was found to stem primarily from differing orthographies and slight inconsistencies in morphological formation;[105] Slovak morphology is more regular (when changing from the nominative to the locative case, Praha becomes Praze in Czech and Prahe in Slovak). The two lexicons are generally considered similar, with most differences found in colloquial vocabulary and some scientific terminology. Slovak has slightly more borrowed words than Czech.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe similarities between Czech and Slovak led to the languages being considered a single language by a group of 19th-century scholars who called themselves \\"Czechoslavs\\" (?echoslovan), believing that the peoples were connected in a way which excluded German Bohemians and (to a lesser extent) Hungarians and other Slavs.[106] During the First Czechoslovak Republic (1918ÿ1938), although \\"Czechoslovak\\" was designated as the republic's official language, both Czech and Slovak written standards were used. Standard written Slovak was partially modeled on literary Czech, and Czech was preferred for some official functions in the Slovak half of the republic. Czech influence on Slovak was protested by Slovak scholars, and when Slovakia broke off from Czechoslovakia in 1938 as the Slovak State (which then aligned with Nazi Germany in World War II), literary Slovak was deliberately distanced from Czech. When the Axis powers lost the war and Czechoslovakia reformed, Slovak developed somewhat on its own (with Czech influence); during the Prague Spring of 1968, Slovak gained independence from (and equality with) Czech,[16] due to the transformation of Czechoslovakia from a unitary state to a federation. Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, \\"Czechoslovak\\" has referred to improvised pidgins of the languages which have arisen from the decrease in mutual intelligibility.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech vocabulary derives primarily from Slavic, Baltic and other Indo-European roots. Although most verbs have Balto-Slavic origins, pronouns, prepositions and some verbs have wider, Indo-European roots.[108] Some loanwords have been restructured by folk etymology to resemble native Czech words (h?bitov, \\"graveyard\\" and listina, \\"list\\").[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Czech loanwords originated in one of two time periods. Earlier loanwords, primarily from German,[110] Greek and Latin,[111] arrived before the Czech National Revival. More recent loanwords derive primarily from English and French,[110] and also from Hebrew, Arabic and Persian. Many Russian loanwords, principally animal names and naval terms, also exist in Czech.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough older German loanwords were colloquial, recent borrowings from other languages are associated with high culture.[110] During the nineteenth century, words with Greek and Latin roots were rejected in favor of those based on older Czech words and common Slavic roots; \\"music\\" is muzyka in Polish and ֿ (muzyka) in Russian, but in Czech it is hudba.[111] Some Czech words have been borrowed as loanwords into English and other languagesfor example, robot (from robota, \\"labor\\")[113] and polka (from polka, \\"Polish woman\\" or from \\"p?lka\\" \\"half\\").[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Article 1 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech: V?ichni lid se rod svobodn a sob rovn co do d?stojnosti a prv. Jsou nadni rozumem a svdomm a maj spolu jednat v duchu bratrstv.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish: \\"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

About two thirds(approx 67%) of the population will be entitled to receive subsidized foodgrains under Targeted Public Distribution System. In a country where almost 40% of children are undernourished the importance of the scheme increases significantly.\\"\\r\\nThe Indian Ministry of Agriculture's Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) has referred to the Bill as the \\"biggest ever experiment in the world for distributing highly subsidized food by any government through a rights based approach.\\"[7] The Bill extends coverage of the Targeted Public Distribution System, India's principal domestic food aid program, to two thirds of the population, or approximately 820 million people. Initially, the Lok Sabha Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution estimated a \\"total requirement of foodgrains, as per the Bill would be 61.55 million [metric] tons in 2012-13.\\"[8] The CACP calculated in May 2013, \\"...the requirement for average monthly PDS offtake is calculated as 2.3 mt for wheat (27.6 mt annually) and 2.8 mt for rice (33.6 mt annually)...\\" When volumes needed for the Public Distribution System and \\"Other Welfare Schemes\\" were aggregated, the CACP estimated rice and wheat requirements to total an \\"annual requirement of 61.2\\" million metric tons.[7] However, the final version of the Bill signed into law includes on page 18 an annex, \\"Schedule IV\\", which estimates the total food grain allocation as 54.926 million metric tons.[9]\\r\\nThe Standing Committee estimated that the value of additional food subsidies (i.e., on top of the existing Public Distribution System) \\"during 2012-13 works out to be...Rs.2409 crores,\\" that is, 24.09 billion rupees, or about $446 million at the then-current exchange rate, for a total expenditure of 1.122 trillion rupees (or between $20 and $21 billion).[8] However, the Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) calculated, \\"Currently, the economic cost of FCI for acquiring, storing and distributing foodgrains is about 40 percent more than the procurement price.\\"[10] The Commission added,\\r\\nThe Commission concluded that the total bill for implementation of the Bill \\"....may touch an expenditure of anywhere between Rs 125,000 to 150,000 crores,\\" i.e., 1.25 to 1.5 trillion rupees.[10] As of the implementation deadline of 4 October 2014, only 11 states had either implemented the Act or declared readiness to do so.[11] On 28 November 2014, the Indian government announced, \\"Allocation of foodgrains to 11 States/Union Territories (UTs) namely, Bihar, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Rajasthan has started under the Act...\\" and that the \\"remaining 25 States/UTs have not completed the preparatory measures required for implementation of the Act.\\" The Indian government extended the deadline for implementation of the Act \\"by another six months, i.e. till 04.04.2015.\\"[12]\\r\\nCriticism of the National Food Security Bill includes accusations of both political motivation and fiscal irresponsibility.[13][14][15][16] One senior opposition politician, Murli Manohar Joshi, went so far as to describe the bill as a measure for \\"vote security\\" (for the ruling government coalition) rather than food security.[13] Another political figure, Mulayam Singh Yadav, declared, \\"It is clearly being brought for elections...Why didnt you bring this bill earlier when poor people were dying because of hunger?...Every election, you bring up a measure. There is nothing for the poor.\\"[17]\\r\\nThe report of the 33rd meeting of the Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy stated, \\"...Food prices are still elevated and the food security bill will aggravate food price inflation as it will tilt supply towards cereals and away from other farm produce (proteins), which will raise food prices further...Members desired that the Reserve Bank impress on the government the need to address supply side constraints which are causing inflationary pressure, especially on the food front.\\"[18][19] Dr. Surjit S. Bhalla warned, \\"The food security bill...if implemented honestly, will cost 3 per cent of the GDP in its very first year.\\"[20] The writer Vivek Kaul noted,\\r\\nThe Indian Ministry of Agriculture's Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices warned that enactment of the Bill could be expected to \\"induce severe imbalance in the production of oilseeds and pulses,\\" and \\"...will create demand pressures, which will inevitably spillover to market prices of food grains. Furthermore, the higher food subsidy burden on the budget will raise the fiscal deficit, exacerbating macro level inflationary pressures.\\"[10] The Commission argued further that the Bill would restrict private initiative in agriculture, reduce competition in the marketplace due to government domination of the grain market, shift money from investments in agriculture to subsidies, and continue focus on cereals production when shifts in consumer demand patterns indicate a need to focus more on protein, fruits and vegetables.[10]\\r\\nThe bill was very widely viewed as a \\"pet project\\" of Indian National Congress(INC) President, Sonia Gandhi.[22][23] Gandhi addressed Parliament the night of the August 2013 Lok Sabha vote on the bill, saying its passage would be a \\"chance to make history\\".[24]\\r\\nFormer National Advisory Council member and development economist Professor Jean Drze, reputedly one of the architects of the original, 2011 version of the bill, wrote, \\"...the Bill is a form of investment in human capital.

These sentences were abolished by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, although a number of prisoners remain imprisoned under the former legislation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Parliament was considering abolition of the death penalty, there were many MPs who were against the reform, and the deal offered was that former capital offences would always inevitably merit a mandatory life sentence. Accordingly, life imprisonment replaced the death penalty as punishment for murderers, firstly for those whose sentences were commuted and later for those whose crimes were not \\"aggravated\\" within the meaning of the Homicide Act 1957. To begin with, it was fairly common for those sentenced to life to be released in around ten to fifteen years.[3] As time passed, it came to be thought that longer sentences should be imposed, especially in cases such as the Moors Murders, the Yorkshire Ripper and Dennis Nilsen. The Home Secretary (and now the Minister for Justice) was empowered to make Whole Life Orders to ensure that particularly dangerous or heinous criminals were never released. Currently, mandatory lifers serve an average of 14 years and for other lifers the average has been in decline and now stands at nine years.[3]\\r\\nFormerly, the Home Secretary reserved the right to set the \\"tariff\\" or minimum length of term for prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment. However, in November 2000 politicians were stripped of this power in relation to defendants aged under 18, following an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights by the murderers of James Bulger.[4]\\r\\nIn November 2002 a similar decision in relation to adult offenders followed a successful challenge by convicted double murderer Anthony Anderson. Anderson had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1988 with a recommended minimum term of 15 years, but the Home Secretary later informed him that he would have to serve at least 20 years. The House of Lords ruled that this was incompatible with his human rights.[5][6]\\r\\nThis judgment was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights. Since then, judges have set minimum terms and only the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom can make any amendments to the sentence. Though politicians can no longer decide when or if a life sentence prisoner can be considered for parole, the Attorney General still has the power to petition the Court of Appeal in a bid to increase any prison terms which are seen as unduly lenient.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Criminal Justice Act 2003 sets out guidelines for how long murderers should spend in prison before being considered for parole. Judges are not obliged to follow the guidelines, but must give reasons in court if they depart from them - whether recommending a lesser or higher minimum term than in accordance with the guidelines.[7]\\r\\nThe guidelines recommended that multiple murderers (who murder two or more people) whose crimes involved sexual abuse, pre-planning, abduction or terrorism should never be released from prison. Such a sentence is known as a \\"whole life order\\". The murder of a single child following abduction, sexual or sadistic conduct also qualifies, as does the murder of a police or prison officer during the course of their duty (since 2015) and murder committed to advance a political, religious or ideological cause - along with any murder which was committed by someone who had previously been convicted of murder. Other multiple murders (two or more) should carry a recommended minimum of 30 years as a starting point sentence prior to consideration of additional aggravating factors and of any mitigating factors. A 30-year minimum should also apply to the worst single murders, including those with sexual or racial motives and the use of a firearm - until 2015, the murder of a police officer in the course of duty also came within this category. Most other murders should be subject to a 15-year minimum as a starting point. Inevitably, there have been numerous departures from these guidelines since they were first put into practice. For example, the judge who sentenced American fugitive David Bieber for the murder of a police officer said that he should never be released from prison,[8] whereas statutory guidelines recommended a 30-year minimum for this type of murder - this was a decade before the act was amended to include the murder of a police officer in the course of duty as one of the offenders whose life sentences should mean life.\\r\\nOn 23 July 2008, Bieber won a High Court appeal against the whole life tariff recommended by the trial judge, and was instead issued with a minimum term of 37 years, effectively meaning that he would not be released until at least 2041, by which time he would be 75 years old if still alive. In the case of Mark Goldstraw, who killed four people in an arson attack on a house in Staffordshire in 2006, the trial judge set a recommended minimum of 35 years; this crime met the guidelines for a whole life term as it involved planning and resulted in the death of more than one person.\\r\\nAngus Sinclair, who had been imprisoned since 1982 for child abuse, was jailed for a minimum of 37 years in 2015. This means he will almost certainly die in prison as he was 69 by the time of his conviction for murdering two teenage girls in 1977. Many other life prisoners have received minimum terms which, due to their great length or the fact that the killer was middle aged or elderly when convicted, make it almost certain that they will never be released.\\r\\nA prisoner who has served their minimum term becomes eligible for parole. If the Parole Board agrees to release a prisoner who was sentenced to life, he or she is released on a life licence meaning that he or she will remain on parole for the remainder of their natural lives. Prisoners who break the conditions of their release, or who are found to be a danger to the public, can be immediately returned to prison for an indefinite period under the terms of this licence.\\r\\nIn England and Wales, the average life sentence prisoner serves around 15 years before being paroled, although those convicted of exceptionally grave crimes remain behind bars for considerably longer; Ian Huntley was given a minimum term of 40 years. Some receive whole life sentences which make it almost certain that they will die in prison; they can only be considered for release on appeal to the High Court, or in exceptional circumstances such as great age or ill health.\\r\\nBy 2015, there were at least 60 prisoners[citation needed] in England and Wales serving such sentences, issued by either the High Court or the Home Office. These include \\"Yorkshire Ripper\\" Peter Sutcliffe. A number of other prisoners have died in prison when serving such sentences including Moors Murderers (Ian Brady and Myra Hindley) and serial killer GP Harold Shipman who committed suicide four years into his sentence.\\r\\nFor England and Wales, the law regarding release on licence of prisoners is laid out in chapter 2 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (see in particular sections 28ÿ30). This Act was amended and updated by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 chapters 6 and 7.[citation needed]\\r\\nFor Scotland, the law is set out in the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993, as amended in relation to life prisoners by the Convention Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Act 2001, which incorporated changes to ensure that the procedure is compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Scottish legal system does not allow a whole life sentence to be issued.[citation needed]\\r\\nUnder the criminal law of England and Wales, a minimum term (formerly \\"tariff\\") is the minimum period that a person serving an indefinite sentence must serve before that person becomes eligible for parole. The sentencing judge bears responsibility for setting the minimum term.\\r\\nThe purpose of this mechanism has been described as follows:\\r\\nThe tariff is the minimum period a life sentence prisoner must serve to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence before being considered for release. After this minimum period has been served release will only take place where the prisoner is judged no longer a risk of harm to the public.\\r\\nThe factors involved in the determination of a tariff were contested in the 1993 case of Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, two 11-year-old boys who were convicted of the murder of two-year-old James Bulger. Although the trial judge initially recommended that the pair would have to serve at least eight years in custody, the High Court later set a minimum term of 10 years. However, in July 1994 the Home Secretary Michael Howard set a tariff of 15 years, based in part on the public outcry over the murders. The ruling also came shortly after The Sun newspaper petitioned the Home Secretary with the signatures of more than 20,000 readers for the two killers to receive stiffer sentences.\\r\\nAnother petition for \\"life to mean life\\" (even though the whole life tariff was not an option in the case offenders who committed their crimes before the age of 21) for the two killers attracted almost 280,000 signatures. It also came at a time when the popularity of the Conservative government was at a low ebb - particularly on Merseyside, where the crime occurred. Some commentators also argued that The Sun newspaper also saw the petition as an attempt to boost its sales on Merseyside, which had plummeted five years earlier due its controversial reporting of the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 Liverpool F.C. supporters were killed at an FA Cup semi-final. In June 1997, the House of Lords ruled that Howard had acted unlawfully when setting the 15-year minimum terms. This ruling also signalled the end of the Home Secretary's powers to set minimum terms for offenders who committed their crimes before the age of 18.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn November 2002, following a European Court of Human Rights ruling that the Home Secretary could no longer set minimum terms for life sentence prisoners, the High Court stripped the Home Secretary of his powers to set minimum terms completely. Earlier that year, following a legal challenge by another convicted murderer, Dennis Stafford, the Home Secretary had also been stripped of his powers to overrule the Parole Board's recommendations that a life sentence prisoner should be granted parole.[citation needed]\\r\\nAnother notable prisoner whose minimum sentence was increased was Myra Hindley, jailed for life in 1966 for her role in the Moors Murders; she was convicted of murdering two children and being an accessory in the murder of a third. Her partner Ian Brady was convicted of all three murders. Their trial judge later recommended to the appropriate authorities that he felt it was unlikely that Brady could ever be rehabilitated and safe to be considered for release, but felt that the same was not true of Hindley once she was removed from Brady's influence, recommending that she should be considered for parole after a period of around 25 years. This ruling was endorsed by at least one Home Secretary and High Court judge, but after the pair confessed to two more murders in 1986, Hindley's minimum term was increased to 30 years and then replaced by a whole life tariff in 1990, although she was not informed of the decision until 1994 - following a High Court ruling that the Home Secretary was obliged to inform all life sentence prisoners when or if they could be considered for parole. This was despite reports by Parole Board and prison officials which stated that Hindley posed little or no risk to society, and should be considered for parole or at least for a transfer to an open prison as a possible prelude to parole in the near future. A number of high-profile supporters, including Lord Longford and David Astor, backed Hindley's campaign for parole, and claimed that a succession of Home Secretaries were keeping her in prison in attempt to win votes for their respective governments, as well as shying away from an inevitable tabloid media backlash that would accompany lost votes for any government whose Home Secretary failed to block Hindley's release from prison. Some sources also claimed that Hindley was being kept in prison for her own safety more than to protect to the public from any risk she might pose, as she had received numerous deaths threats from relatives of the Moors Murders victims and from members of the public pledging to kill her if she was ever set free. Hindley lodged three appeals against her whole life tariff, but all three appeals were unsuccessful and she remained in prison until her death in November 2002, just over a week before the Home Secretary was stripped of his powers to set minimum terms for life sentence prisoners. Daily Mirror columnist Carole Malone was not a supporter of Hindley's campaign for parole, but was critical of Michael Howard's motives for reaffirming Hindley's whole life tariff in February 1997 - three months before an inevitable general election defeat - and claimed that the Home Secretary was seizing the opportunity to win votes by keeping Myra Hindley in prison. Immediately after Hindley's death, Malone commented that it had been inevitable that Hindley would die in prison, as successive Home Secretaries were too fearful about the survival of their government to consider Hindley's release.\\r\\nIn the days between Hindley's death and the ruling being delivered, the Home Secretary issued 50-year minimum terms on four convicted child killers who had been convicted of high-profile murders between 1995 and 2001. Various legal and media sources, whether opposing or supporting the 50-year tariffs, were keen to argue that the 50-year minimum terms were politically motivated, as the crimes were high profile and still relatively fresh in public memory, and that the Home Secretary had also seized the opportunity to set these hefty tariffs as he knew that he was on the verge of being stripped of these powers. The government was also under public scrutiny due to the start of a firefighter's strike which began after the government failed to settle pay and working conditions with the national firefighter's union.\\r\\nWith the death of Myra Hindley, the Home Secretary had lost perhaps the most high-profile prisoner in the prison system, whose minimum term had been increased by a succession of Home Secretaries, leaving him with limited time to select new high-profile prisoners to impose heavy sentences on. Some of these factors were used as grounds to appeal in June 2010 when one of the killers, Roy Whiting, successfully appealed to have his sentence reduced in the High Court.\\r\\nA similar system operates in Scotland, whereby the trial judge fixes a \\"punishment part\\" to \\"satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence\\". The prisoner cannot be considered for parole until this punishment part is served.\\r\\nFor example, for a murder, someone may be given a life sentence with a minimum term of 15 years. This means they cannot be released on parole until the minimum term is served. Some prisoners serve considerably longer than the minimum term recommended by the trial judge - even if it was later reaffirmed or reduced by a Home Secretary or by the High Court. A notable example is Harry Roberts, jailed for life in 1966 for his role in the murder of three policemen in London. His trial judge recommended that he serve at least 30 years before being considered for parole, but he was not granted parole until 2014, by which time he had served 48 years in prison.\\r\\nThe terms below are only guidelines for adults, and starting points vary in different legal cases. Starting points may either be increased or decreased depending on aggravating and/or mitigating factors respectively. The guidelines are in Schedule 21 of the Act.\\r\\nHowever, the law still states that life sentence prisoners (and prisoners issued with fixed-term prison sentences) who have been convicted of crimes committed before the Criminal Justice Act 2003 came into force (18 December 2003) are sentenced according to guidelines which existed when the crime was committed.\\r\\nMurder of a child involving abduction or sexual or sadistic conduct.\\r\\nAny assassination committed to further a religious, political, racial or ideological cause.\\r\\nMurder by a person previously convicted of murder.\\r\\nMurder of a police or prison officer in the execution of their duty (from 13 April 2015).[9][10]\\r\\nMurder done for personal gain.\\r\\nMurder to obstruct the course of justice.\\r\\nMurder involving sexual or sadistic conduct.\\r\\nMultiple murder.\\r\\nRacially, sexually, or religiously aggravated murder.\\r\\nMurder committed by a person aged under 21 if it would otherwise deserve a whole life order.\\r\\n(In Griffiths and others v R (2012)[11] the Court of Appeal said that this list is not exhaustive.)\\r\\nWhole-life orders cannot be given to offenders under the age of 21.[12][13]\\r\\nThe whole life order (formerly a whole life tariff) is a court order whereby a prisoner who is being sentenced to life imprisonment is ordered to serve that sentence without possibility of parole. This order may be made in cases of aggravated murders committed by anyone who was aged 21 or above at the time of the crime. The purpose of a whole life order is for a prisoner to be kept in prison until he or she dies, although in exceptional circumstances a prisoner can still be released by the Home Secretary on compassionate grounds such as great age or ill health; which has also seen several life sentence prisoners being granted early release a considerable length of time before the date when they could first apply for parole.\\r\\nA whole life tariff can also be quashed on appeal by the Court of Appeal; a number of prisoners have had their sentences reduced by this method. From 1983, the Home Secretary had the right to decide how long a life sentence prisoner should serve before being considered for parole, and the trial judge was not obliged to recommend when or if an offender should be considered for parole. In some cases, the trial judge had recommended that a life sentence prisoner should at some point be considered for parole, only for the Home Secretary to later impose a whole life tariff; this happened in a number of cases involving prisoners who had been sentenced to life imprisonment before or after 1983.\\r\\nThe question of whether a Home Secretary should have the power to impose whole life tariffs was a controversial one, since a decision to impose such a sanction (or not) could carry political consequences for the Home Secretary and, by extension, the government he served ÿ as well as a backlash by the national media. Perhaps the most notable example is Myra Hindley, jailed for life in 1966 for her role in the Moors Murders. Her trial judge recommended that she should serve a minimum of 25 years before being considered for parole, However, this was later increased to 30 years and in 1990 to \\"whole life\\" by David Waddington.\\r\\nThe introduction of the government's tariff-setting procedures in 1983 also came shortly after a number of other high-profile murderers convicted. 1983 was also the year in which Dennis Nilsen was jailed for life for murdering 11 young men whose dismembered properties were found at the two flats he had rented in North London. Two years earlier, \\"Yorkshire Ripper\\" Peter Sutcliffe had been found guilty of murdering 13 women and attacking seven others in a six-year spree.\\r\\nIn 1976, \\"Black Panther\\" Donald Neilson had been convicted on four charges of murder at the end of a highly publicised trial. All of these murderers were also subjected to a whole life tariff by subsequent Home Secretaries; Neilson remained in prison until his death in 2011, while Nilsen and Sutcliffe both remain imprisoned more than 30 years into their sentences, despite recommendations from their trial judges that they should be considered for parole after 25 and 30 years respectively.\\r\\nIn November 2002, a successful legal challenge by convicted double murderer Anthony Anderson saw the Home Secretary stripped of the final say on how long a life sentence prisoner must serve before parole can be considered, including the right to decide that certain prisoners should never be released. This ruling had been anticipated for several months, and was delivered just days after the death of Myra Hindley, who had been widely expected to gain immediate parole in the event of the Home Secretary being stripped of these sentencing powers.\\r\\nA year later, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 was passed, which required that the trial judge recommended the minimum number of years to be served (or order that life should mean life) in the case of anyone being sentenced to life imprisonment.[14] As had been the case when the Home Secretary could decide on the minimum length of a life sentence, prisoners were entitled to have their tariff reviewed by the High Court. These prisoners can also appeal to the European Court of Human Rights if their appeals to the High Court are unsuccessful.[15]\\r\\nIn June 1997, the High Court had already stripped the Home Secretary of their powers to decide on minimum terms for life sentence prisoners who were convicted before the age of 18, following a legal challenge by solicitors acting for Robert Thompson and Jon Venables. The pair had been found guilty of murdering Merseyside toddler James Bulger in 1993, when they were 11 years old. The trial judge's initial recommendation was that they should not be considered for parole for at least eight years. The Lord Chief Justice later ruled that the pair should serve a minimum sentence of 10 years, but following a petition by The Sun newspaper, Home Secretary Michael Howard had ruled during 1994 that the pair should not be released until they had spent at least 15 years in custody.\\r\\nOpponents on this ruling had argued that this decision had been politically motivated; the murder of James Bulger had been a highly publicised case, the change in the sentence had been announced at a time when the Conservative government was trailing the Labour opposition in the opinion polls (which might have seen a \\"vote puller\\", in a similar vein to the constant changes to Myra Hindley's sentence), and was perhaps seen as an attempt by The Sun newspaper to regain lost sales on Merseyside, where its circulation had slumped dramatically since its controversial reporting of the Hillsborough disaster (which had claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans) five years earlier.\\r\\nOnly the Home Secretary can grant a release to a prisoner sentenced to a whole life tariff or whole life order, on compassionate grounds including great age or ill health. Only four prisoners known or believed to have been issued with a whole life tariff have so far been released from their sentences. Three of them were IRA members who were freed under the Good Friday Agreement in 1999, having spent more than 20 years in prison for terrorist offences including murder. The other was gang member Reggie Kray, who was freed from his life sentence in August 2000 after serving 32 years (two years after the expiry of his original 30-year minimum term) due to terminal cancer; although the Home Office never confirmed he had been issued with a whole life tariff, his lengthy imprisonment and the fact that he was not paroled when his tariff expired (despite being well into his sixties) helped fuel media speculation that he was among the prisoners who had been issued with a whole life tariff. He died a few weeks after being freed.\\r\\nMany prisoners have also received minimum sentences which are likely to last for most if not all of their remaining lives, such as child killers Roy Whiting and Ian Huntley, who were both convicted of child murder and received 40-year minimum terms which mean that they cannot apply for parole until they are at least 82 and 68 respectively. Whiting's trial judge had originally recommended that life should mean life and just before the High Court stripped politicians of their sentencing powers in November 2002, Home Secretary David Blunkett set Whiting's minimum term at 50 years, which was effectively a whole life tariff as it meant that he could only apply for parole if he lived to be at least 92. This decision was later appealed before the High Court, and the tariff was reduced to a 40-year minimum term. Huntley murdered two 10-year-old girls in August 2002, but by the time he was convicted 16 months later, the Home Secretary had been stripped of powers to set minimum terms for life sentence prisoners, and that decision was instead left to the High Court.\\r\\nPerhaps the most notable prisoner to have been issued with a whole life tariff is Myra Hindley, who was jailed for life in 1966 for her part in the Moors Murders with Ian Brady; she was convicted of two murders and being an accessory in a third murder which Ian Brady was convicted of. Her original 25-year minimum term was later increased to 30 years in 1985 by Home Secretary Leon Brittan, before his successor David Waddington ruled in 1990 that life should mean life for Hindley. His successors Michael Howard, Jack Straw and David Blunkett agreed with this ruling over the next 11 years.\\r\\nBetween 1997 and 2000, Hindley made three appeals against the ruling that life should mean life in her case, but each was unsuccessful. She remained in prison until her death in November 2002, 36 years after she was jailed. Her campaign for parole was supported by the likes of Lord Longford and David Astor, who claimed that she was a reformed character who had merely acted as Brady's accomplice under duress, and had completely changed once removed from his influence. However, opinion polls showed that the majority of the British public was opposed to Hindley being paroled, and the tabloid media largely opposed her release as well. Hindley received numerous death threats from members of the public ÿ including the relatives of some of the Moors Murders victims ÿ who vowed to kill her if she were ever released from prison. Widespread public and media doubt as to whether Hindley's remorse was genuine was further fueled by the fact that Hindley did not confess to two more murders until 1986, and further strengthened the belief of those who opposed her attempts to win parole that the reported turnaround in her life while in prison was nothing more than a ploy to boost her chances of parole.\\r\\nIan Brady was also told by a succession of Home Secretaries that his life sentence should mean life, but unlike Hindley he never attempted to gain parole, and insisted he never wanted to be released from custody. In 1999, he even made an unsuccessful legal challenge to be allowed to starve himself to death. He died in May 2017 after more than 50 years in prison, and was Britain's longest-serving prisoner.\\r\\nSince 2003, the law has provided that whole life orders cannot be issued to anyone who was under the age of 21 at the time of their crime, although there had never been a previous case of a whole life tariff being imposed or recommended to someone who committed their crime before the age of 21.[16]\\r\\nAround 100 prisoners are believed to have been issued with whole life tariffs since the mechanism was first introduced in 1983, although some of them were convicted of their crimes before that date and some of the prisoners known to have been issued with the whole life tariff have since died in prison or had their sentences reduced on appeal.[citation needed]\\r\\nA number of prisoners who are unlikely to ever be released or have received very long sentences have declared their wish to die;[citation needed] for example, Ian Brady. At least two such inmates have committed suicide in prison, Harold Shipman and Daniel Gonzalez and there have been attempted suicides by such prisoners, including Ian Huntley. A number have since died in prison as a result of ill health, including Brady's accomplice Myra Hindley and the \\"Black Panther\\" serial murderer and armed robber Donald Neilson.\\r\\nWhole life sentences have also been criticised in some quarters for giving offenders no incentive to behave well and co-operate with prison staff, or make any serious attempt at rehabilitation. This was highlighted by the case of Robert Mawdsley, jailed for life for a single murder in 1975, who went on to kill three inmates several years into his sentence. In 2016, a second convicted murderer, Victor Castigador, admitted to murdering another prisoner. At least two other such prisoners have seriously wounded other inmates in prison. Shortly after being jailed for life in 2005, spree killer Mark Hobson poured a bucket of boiling water over Ian Huntley and left him scarred for life. In 2012, convicted murderer Gary Vinter admitted slashing Roy Whiting with a sharpened toilet brush handle. Four years later, Vinter admitted the attempted murder of another inmate who was left with a traumatic brain injury and blinded in one eye. Vinter's lawyer claimed after the second attack that the absence of any likelihood of eventual release from prison had left him with no incentive to co-operate with the prison regime.[citation needed]\\r\\nThree convicted murderers, Jeremy Bamber, Peter Moore and Douglas Vinter, all murderers who had been sentenced to whole life orders, applied to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, for the court to declare that it is a contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights for someone to be sentenced to lifelong imprisonment. When the initial ruling was delivered in January 2012, the court ruled that because the whole-life orders were imposed by a judge only after consideration of the facts of each case, and because the life prisoners could apply to the Home Secretary for compassionate release, their whole life orders did not breach their human rights.[17][18]\\r\\nA later appeal by the same men led to a ruling in July 2013 that there must be a prospect of review of whole-life tariffs within 25 years of the prisoner being sentenced, and that any impossibility of parole would violate their Article 3 rights.[19] By this stage there were at least 49 prisoners serving such sentences in England and Wales.[20]\\r\\nIn February 2014, five judges at the Court of Appeal (ECHR) found the Strasbourg court was incorrect in concluding English and Welsh law never allowed whole life orders to be reduced because the Secretary of State could reduce such orders in \\"exceptional circumstances\\", and that all \\"whole life\\" prisoners would be entitled to a review of their sentence within 25 years of being sentenced. Lord Thomas, current Lord Chief Justice said whole life orders were compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in the most appalling cases of murder. Thomas said further, \\"Judges should therefore continue as they have done to impose whole-life orders in those rare and exceptional cases. ... In our judgment the law of England and Wales therefore does provide to an offender 'hope' or the 'possibility' of release in exceptional circumstances which render the just punishment originally imposed no longer justifiable.\\"[21]\\r\\nIn February 2015, the ECHR upheld the lawfulness of whole life orders, on the ground that they can be reviewed in exceptional circumstances, following a fresh challenge by murderer Arthur Hutchinson, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for a triple murder in Sheffield more than 30 years earlier. Another legal challenge to the court by Hutchinson was rejected in January 2017. A fresh challenge by another \\"whole life\\" prisoner ÿ Jamie Reynolds, who murdered a teenage girl in Shropshire in 2013 ÿ is now reportedly pending with the ECHR. By this stage, there were believed to be more than 70 prisoners in England and Wales serving whole life sentences.[22]","input":"What is a life prison sentence in the uk?"},{"output":"adds a touring package consisting of a windshield, white wall tires, studded seats, studded passenger backrest, and studded saddlebags","context":"The Suzuki Boulevard C50 (VL800) is a cruiser motorcycle made by Suzuki Motor Corporation since 2001.

Strictly regulated brothels operate legally in isolated rural areas, away from the majority of Nevada's population. Prostitution is illegal in the following counties: Clark (which contains Las Vegas), Washoe (which contains Reno), Douglas, and Lincoln. Prostitution is also illegal in Nevada's capital, Carson City, an independent city. The rest of Nevada's counties are permitted by state law to license brothels, but only eight counties have done so. As of August 2013, there are 19 brothels in Nevada.[1]\\r\\nDespite there being a legal option, the vast majority of prostitution in Nevada takes place illegally in Reno and Las Vegas.[2][3][4] About 66 times more money is spent by customers on illegal prostitution in Nevada than in the regulated brothels.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBrothels have been allowed in Nevada since the middle of the 19th century. One brothel in Elko has been in business since 1902. In 1937, a law was enacted to require weekly health checks of all prostitutes. In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an order to suppress prostitution near military basesaffecting the red-light districts of Reno and Las Vegas. When this order was lifted in 1948, Reno officials tried to shut down a brothel as a public nuisance; this action was upheld by the Nevada Supreme Court in 1949. In 1951, both Reno and Las Vegas had closed their red-light districts as public nuisances, but brothels continued to exist throughout the state.[6]\\r\\nIn 1971, Joe Conforte, owner of a brothel called Mustang Ranch, near Reno, managed to convince county officials to pass an ordinance which would provide for the licensing of brothels and prostitutes, thus avoiding the threat of being closed down as a public nuisance.[7]\\r\\nOfficials in Las Vegas, afraid that Conforte would use the same technique to open a brothel nearby, convinced the legislature, in 1971, to pass a law prohibiting the legalization of prostitution in counties with a population above a certain threshold, tailored to apply only to Clark County.[8]\\r\\nIn 1977, county officials in Nye County tried to shut down Walter Plankinton's Chicken Ranch as a public nuisance; brothels did not have to be licensed in that county at the time, and several others were operating. Plankinton filed suit, claiming that the 1971 state law had implicitly removed the assumption that brothels are public nuisances per se. The Nevada Supreme Court agreed with this interpretation in 1978,[9] and so the Chicken Ranch was allowed to operate. In another case, brothel owners in Lincoln County protested when the county outlawed prostitution in 1978, having issued licenses for seven years. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled, however, that the county had the right to do so.[10]\\r\\nA state law prohibiting the advertising of brothels in counties which have outlawed prostitution was enacted in 1979. It was promptly challenged on First Amendment grounds, but in 1981, the Nevada Supreme Court declared it to be constitutional.[11] (Princess Sea Industries, one of the parties involved in the case, was Plankinton's company that owned the Chicken Ranch.) In July 2007, the law was overturned by a U.S. District judge as \\"overly broad\\", and advertising in Las Vegas started soon after.[12][13] In March 2010, the district judge's decision was reversed back by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.[14] The ACLU has appealed[when?] to the full Ninth Circuit Court.[15]\\r\\nWhile brothels and prostitutes are subject to federal income tax and also pay local fees, Nevada has no state income tax, and brothels are exempt from the state entertainment tax and do not pay any other state taxes. In 2005, brothel owners lobbied to be taxed in order to increase the legitimacy of the business, but the legislature declined.[16] Brothels pay taxes to their respective counties. Lyon County receives approximately $400,000 to $500,000 per year from these taxes.[17]\\r\\nIn November 2005, former prostitute and madam Heidi Fleiss said that she would partner with brothel owner Joe Richards to turn Richards' existing Cherry Patch Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nye County, Nevada into an establishment that would employ male prostitutes and cater exclusively to female customers, a first in Nevada. In 2009, however, she said that she had abandoned her plans to open such a brothel due to wishing to avoid having to \\"deal with all the nonsense in the sex business\\" and preferring to focus on renewable energy which would be \\"perfect for Nevada..that's the wave of the future.\\"[18]\\r\\nOn December 11, 2009, the Nevada State Board of Health unanimously agreed to add urethral examinations to the guidelines, thus allowing male sex workers to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases.[19]\\r\\nUnder Nevada state law, any county with a population under 700,000, as of the last decennial census,[20] is allowed to license brothels if it so chooses.[8] Incorporated towns and cities in counties that allow prostitution may regulate the trade further or prohibit it altogether.\\r\\nCurrently eight out of Nevada's 16 counties have active brothels (these are all rural counties). As of August 2013 there are 19 legal brothels.[21]\\r\\nProstitution is illegal under state law in Clark County (which contains Las Vegas), and under county or municipal law in Washoe County (which contains Reno), Carson City (an independent city), Douglas County, and Lincoln County. The other 12 Nevada counties permit licensed brothels in certain specified areas or cities,[6] with the exception of Eureka County, which has no law on the books either permitting or prohibiting licensed brothels.[22] All 12 of these rural counties have had at least one legal brothel in operation subsequent to 1971, but many of these brothels were financially unsuccessful or ran afoul of State health regulations. As of 2012, only eight of these counties have active brothels, while the other four (Churchill County, Esmeralda County, Eureka County, and Pershing County) no longer do.\\r\\nThe precise licensing requirements vary by county. License fees for brothels range from an annual $100,000 in Storey County to an annual $200,000 in Lander County. Licensed prostitutes must be at least 21 years old, except in Storey County and Lyon County (where the minimum age is 18).\\r\\nThe brothels and their employees must register with the county sheriff and receive regular medical checkups. Brothels have existed in Nevada since the old mining days of the 1800s and were first licensed in 1971. The legendary Mustang Ranch operated from 1971 through 1999, when it was forfeited to the federal government following a series of convictions for tax fraud, racketeering, and other crimes.\\r\\nNevada law requires that registered brothel prostitutes be tested weekly (by a cervical specimen) for gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis, and monthly for HIV and syphilis;[23] furthermore, condoms are mandatory for all oral sex and sexual intercourse. Brothel owners may be held liable if customers become infected with HIV after a prostitute has tested positive for the virus.[24] Women work a legally mandated minimum of nine days for each work period.[25]\\r\\nNevada has laws against engaging in prostitution outside of licensed brothels, against encouraging others to become prostitutes, and against living off the proceeds of a prostitute.\\r\\nNevada brothels are restricted from advertising their services in counties where brothel prostitution is illegal, despite the fact that this state law was ruled unconstitutional in 2007. U.S. District Judge James Mahan voided the state ban on advertising by legal brothels on grounds the state did not offer any compelling interest in support of the policy, but the U.S Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the state law in March 2010. FN#13.[12] This law is presently under appeal by the ACLU. FN#14\\r\\nIn June 2009, then-Nevada Governor Jim Gibbons signed the most stringent punishments nationwide for child prostitution and pandering. The Assembly Bill 380, which allows for fines of $500,000 for those convicted of trafficking prostitutes younger than 14 and $100,000 for trafficking prostitutes ages 14 to 17. Both the House and the Senate unanimously approved the bill, that went into effect October 1, 2009.[26]\\r\\nNineteen legal brothels exist in the state as of August 2013, employing about 200 women at any given time.[21] In some locales, there exist multi-unit complexes of several separate brothels run by the same owner. Examples of this include \\"The Line\\" in Winnemucca, Mustang Ranch, in Storey County.\\r\\nAll but the smallest brothels operate as follows: as the customer is buzzed in and sits down in the parlor, the available women appear in a line-up and introduce themselves. If the customer chooses a woman, the price negotiations take place in the woman's room, which are often overheard by management. Typical prices start in the hundreds. Some may charge up to $10,000 an hour for \\"Specialty parties\\" with well-known or novelty women, or more for parties with multiple women.\\r\\nBrothels do not have preset prices, the only known exception being the Shady Lady Ranch on Route 95, approximately 30 miles (48 km) north of Beatty. Generally, the closer a brothel is to Las Vegas, the higher the prices. Thus Sheri's Ranch and Chicken Ranch, both located in Pahrump, are on the whole more expensive than other brothels. Sheri's Ranch[27] is the larger of the two, and may have upwards of 20 prostitutes on its premises at any given time. It is also the more high end of the two, and generally the most expensive legal brothel in Nevada.[citation needed]\\r\\nBrothel prostitutes, also known as Courtesans, work as independent contractors and thus do not receive any unemployment, retirement or health benefits from the house they work for. They are responsible for paying Federal income tax and their earnings are reported to the IRS via form 1099-MISC. Nevada does not have a state income tax. The women typically work for a period of several weeks, during which time they live in the brothel and hardly ever leave it. They then take some time off.\\r\\nMandatory HIV testing began in 1986 and a mandatory condom law was passed in 1988. A study conducted in 1995 in two brothels found that condom use in the brothels was consistent and sexually transmitted diseases were accordingly absent. The study also found that few of the prostitutes used condoms in their private lives.[28]\\r\\nIllegal prostitution is the most common form of prostitution in Nevada; the crime is a misdemeanor. The cities of Las Vegas and Reno have worked to expand their tourism base by attracting families to the hotels and casinos. Accordingly, the state legislature has made prostitution illegal in Clark County, and law enforcement agencies have tried to eliminate the once-rampant street prostitution, enacting legislation against it in 1971. Nevertheless, prostitutes continue to work in casinos, where they wait in bars and attempt to make contact with potential clients.[29] Of all the prostitution business in Nevada, only about 10% is legal, and 90% occurs in Las Vegas.[30] Legal prostitution in Nevada grosses about $75?million per year while illegal prostitution in the Las Vegas area grosses about $5?billion per year.[5] Some 300ÿ400 prostitutes are arrested each month by the Las Vegas police.[31]\\r\\nEscort services offering sexual services euphemistically as 'entertainment' or 'companionship' are ubiquitous, with a reported 104 pages of a Las Vegas yellow pages directory devoted to \\"entertainers\\".[32] Flyers are dispensed to tourists and others along the Las Vegas Strip by freelance workers. These flyers also graphically depict female 'personal' entertainers or escort services. Despite the attempt to make the Las Vegas Strip more family-friendly, such advertising for these services continues.[33]\\r\\nIn 2009 Las Vegas was identified by the FBI as one of 14 cities in the U.S. with high rates of child prostitution.[34] Las Vegas police claimed that \\"roughly 400 children are picked off the streets from prostitution each year.\\"[35]\\r\\nThe U.S. Justice Department has also named Las Vegas among the 17 most likely destinations for human trafficking.[36]\\r\\nThe brothels in Nevada's rural counties have been criticized by journalists, sex worker activists, feminists, social and religious conservatives and politicians.\\r\\nColumnist Bob Herbert wrote \\"A grotesque exercise in the dehumanization of women is carried out routinely at Sheri's Ranch, a legal brothel about an hours ride outside of Vegas. There the women have to respond like Pavlovs dog to an electronic bell that might ring at any hour of the day or night. At the sound of the bell, the prostitutes have five minutes to get to an assembly area where they line up, virtually naked, and submit to a humiliating inspection by any prospective customer who has happened to drop by\\".[37]\\r\\nThe working conditions from these brothels have also been criticized by many.[by whom?][citation needed] During the 1970s and early 1980s, several towns had enacted rules prohibiting local brothel prostitutes from frequenting local bars or casinos or associating with local men outside of work. After a lawsuit was filed in 1984, these regulations had to be abandoned, but as a result of collaboration between sheriffs and brothel owners, they remain in effect unofficially.[citation needed] For instance, most brothels do not allow the prostitutes to leave the premises during their work shifts of several days to several weeks.[6]\\r\\nIn 2009, an article in the Guardian stated that some brothels \\"impose some extraordinary restrictions on commercial sex workers\\" in order to \\"separate sex workers from the local community\\": some places forbid prostitutes to leave the brothels for extended periods of time, while other jurisdictions require the prostitutes to leave the county when they are not working; some places do not allow the children of the women who work in the brothels to live in the same area; some brothel workers who have cars must register the vehicle with the local police, and workers are not permitted to leave the brothel after 5pm; in some counties registered sex workers are not allowed to have cars at all.[38]\\r\\nThe Nevada brothel system has also been criticized by activists in the sex worker rights movement, who are otherwise supporters of full decriminalization of prostitution.[39][40] Organizations and individuals supporting the rights of prostitutes typically favor deregulation and oppose Nevada-style regulation, mainly for three reasons:[41]\\r\\nTeri, a prostitute who has worked in a Nevada brothel (and who would like prostitution to be decriminalized), stated that \\"The brothel owners are worse than any pimp. They abuse and imprison women and are fully protected by the state\\".[42]\\r\\nAnother former prostitute who worked in four Nevada brothels attacked the system, saying, \\"Under this system, prostitutes give up too much autonomy, control and choice over their work and lives\\" and \\"While the brothel owners love this profitable solution, it can be exploitative and is unnecessary\\". She described how the women were subject to various exaggerated restrictions, including making it very difficult for them to refuse clients, not being allowed to read books while waiting for customers, and having to deal with doctors who had a \\"patronizing or sexist attitude\\" (the brothels discouraged and in many cases forbade prostitutes to see doctors of their own choosing).[43]\\r\\nIn an article published in the Guardian in 2007, Julie Bindel wrote: \\"If you believe their PR, Nevada's legal brothels are safe, healthy ÿ even fun ÿ places in which to work. So why do so many prostitutes tell such horrific tales of abuse?\\"[44]\\r\\nIn her 2007 report, Prostitution and trafficking in Nevada: making the connections, Melissa Farley presents the results of numerous interviews with brothel owners and prostitutes, she says that most brothel prostitutes are controlled by outside pimps and that they suffer widespread abuse by brothel owners and customers.[45][46] Farley said that \\"What happens in legal brothels is sexual harassment, sexual exploitation and sometimes rape\\";[47] she also said more than 80% of the women she had interviewed told her they wanted to leave prostitution.[48]\\r\\nAlexa Albert, a Harvard medical student who has conducted a public-health study inside one of Nevada's brothels, and authored Brothel: Mustang Ranch and Its Women,[49] wrote in her book that the brothel owners used to require the prostitutes to have outside pimps, because the pimps were thought to make the women work harder: \\"The involvement of pimps enabled brothel owners to leave discipline to men who wouldn't hesitate to keep their women in line.\\"[50]\\r\\nBob Herbert also stated that many brothel prostitutes are controlled by outside pimps: \\"Despite the fiction that they are independent contractors, most so-called legal prostitutes have pimps  the state-sanctioned pimps who run the brothels and, in many cases, a second pimp who controls all other aspects of their lives (and takes the bulk of their legal earnings).\\"[51]\\r\\nIn 1998, some pimps from Oregon managed to place at least four underage girls in Nevada's legal brothels; they were arrested and convicted.[52][53]\\r\\nDetective Greg Harvey, from Eugene, Oregon, said such cases were in reality very common; he said, \\"It's happening right now, it's amazing how many girls are shipped from here to different brothels in northern and southern Nevada. Many are underage.\\" Another detective, Sgt. Pete Kerns, supported Harvey's claims: \\"Never buy the line that nobody under 18 works in (Nevada brothels),\\" he said. \\"It's happening.\\"[53]\\r\\nFormer Nye County Commissioner Candice Trummell, director of the Nevada Coalition Against Sex Trafficking, said \\"It is way past time for Nevada to be the last state in the United States of America to finally stand against all forms of slavery.\\"[54]\\r\\nAssemblyman Bob L. Beers said that \\"A brothel owner is somebody who, when it gets down to the very essence, is nothing more than a slave-owner.\\"[47]\\r\\nSome brothel owners have been involved in criminal activities: in March 2009, a Nye County brothel owner pleaded guilty to fraud charges for paying bribes to a former Nye County Commissioner;[55] in 2008, a former brothel owner was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison on two child pornography charges;[56] in 1991 Joe Conforte fled to Brazil in order to avoid a conviction on tax fraud charges.\\r\\nOccasionally, lawmakers attempt to introduce legislation outlawing all prostitution in Nevada. These efforts are typically supported by owners of casinos and other large businesses, claiming that legalized prostitution harms the state's image. The Nevada Brothel Owners' Association, led by George Flint, from Reno, lobbies against these laws.[57][58] Rural lawmakers normally oppose these laws as well, despite the fact that legal brothel prostitution does not provide a significant amount of income for counties.\\r\\nOne particularly colorful opponent of legalized prostitution in Nevada was John Reese. Initially arguing on moral and religious grounds, he switched to health hazard tactics, but had to back down in the face of a threatened libel suit. In 1994, he tried to get a license for a gay brothel in a thinly veiled attempt to galvanize opposition against all brothels. Then in 1999 he staged his own kidnapping near the Mustang Ranch.[59] His efforts to collect enough signatures to repeal the prostitution laws have so far failed.\\r\\nNevada politicians can (and generally do) play both sides of the prostitution dispute by declaring that they are personally opposed to prostitution but feel it should be up to the counties to decide. As almost three-quarters of the population of Nevada lives in a single county (Clark County, where prostitution is illegal), county control over local matters is a hot-button issue. Legislators from the northern counties will often reflexively oppose what is seen as \\"meddling\\" from the majority in the south, and the legislators from the south have been too divided on the issue to push through a state-wide ban.\\r\\nSince 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said.[60][61]\\r\\nThe brothel owners' organization, supported by Democratic State Senator Bob Coffin, has been pushing for taxation of the brothels, to increase the industry's legitimacy. The proposal, which would have instituted a $5 tax per act of prostitution, with the proceeds partly being used for a sex worker counseling agency,[62] was voted down in the Taxation Committee in April 2009.[63]\\r\\nIn February 2011, U.S. Senator Harry Reid suggested that brothels be made illegal in Nevada.[64][65]\\r\\nThe opinions of Nevada residents vary, but the majority appears to support the status quo of prostitution: they support laws allowing licensed brothels in the rural areas but oppose the legalization of prostitution in Las Vegas. A poll conducted in Nevada in 2002[66] found that 52% of the 600 respondents favored the existing legal and regulated brothels, while 31% were against laws that allow prostitution and the remainder were undecided, preferred fewer legal constraints on prostitution, or did not offer an opinion. The trend seems to be that new arrivals to Nevada tend to oppose legal prostitution while long-time Nevadans tend to support it. However, nearly 60% of Nevada residents oppose the legalization of brothels and prostitution in Las Vegas (59% oppose this idea, 35% support it and 6% don't know or didn't answer). Again, support is stronger in the rural areas (where most people were born in Nevada) and weaker in Clark County and Washoe County; women are more opposed to the idea than men.[67]\\r\\nIn 2004, after the closure of the last brothel in Churchill County, a county ballot initiative to permanently ban prostitution in that county was defeated by a 2ÿ1 vote.[68]\\r\\nA July 2011 Public Policy Polling survey found that 56% of Nevada voters thought that prostitution should be legal, while only 32% thought it should be illegal and 12% were not sure.[69]\\r\\nA June 2012 Public Policy Polling survey found that 64% of Nevada voters thought that brothels should be legal in the state, while only 23% thought they should be illegal, and 13% were not sure.[70]\\r\\nCrystal, Nye County, Nevada has a brothel art museum associated with two local brothels.[71]\\r\\n Media related to Brothels in Nevada at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What are the prostitution laws in las vegas?"},{"output":"twenty-year-old Jack Dawson, a penniless Wisconsin man who wins two tickets for the third-class on the ill-fated RMS Titanic","context":"Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio (/d??k?prio?/; born November 11, 1974) is an American actor, film producer, and environmental activist.[2] DiCaprio began his career by appearing in television commercials in the late 1980s, after which he had recurring roles in various television series such as the soap opera Santa Barbara and the sitcom Growing Pains. He began his film career by starring as Josh in Critters 3 (1991). He starred in the film adaptation of the memoir This Boy's Life (1993), and was praised for his supporting role in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993). He gained public recognition with leading roles in The Basketball Diaries (1995) and the romantic drama Romeo + Juliet (1996), before achieving international fame with James Cameron's epic romance Titanic (1997), which became the highest-grossing film of all time to that point.\\r\\nSince 2000, DiCaprio has received critical acclaim for his work in a wide range of film genres. DiCaprio's subsequent films include The Man in the Iron Mask (1998), the biographical crime drama Catch Me If You Can (2002), and the epic historical drama Gangs of New York (2002), which marked his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. He was acclaimed for his performances in the political war thriller Blood Diamond (2006), the neo-noir crime drama The Departed (2006), the espionage thriller Body of Lies (2008), the drama Revolutionary Road (2008), the psychological thriller Shutter Island (2010), the science fiction thriller Inception (2010), the biographical film J.

He also won the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for his performance in The Revenant. DiCaprio is the founder of his own production company, Appian Way Productions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born on November 11, 1974, in Los Angeles.[3] He is the only child of Irmelin (ne Indenbirken), a legal secretary, and George DiCaprio, an underground comix artist and producer and distributor of comic books.[4] DiCaprio's father is of Italian (from Alife) and German (from Bavaria) descent.[5][6][7] DiCaprio's maternal grandfather, Wilhelm Indenbirken, was German.[8] His maternal grandmother, Helene Indenbirken (born Yelena Smirnova; 1915ÿ2008),[9] was a Russian-born German citizen.[10][11] In an interview in Russia, DiCaprio referred to himself as \\"half-Russian\\" and said that two of his grandparents were Russian.[12] DiCaprio's parents met while attending college and subsequently moved to Los Angeles, California.[5]\\r\\nDiCaprio was named Leonardo because his pregnant mother was looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in the Uffizi museum in Florence, Italy, when he first kicked.[13] His parents separated when he was a year old, and he lived mostly with his mother.[14] The two lived in several Los Angeles neighborhoods, such as Echo Park and Los Feliz (his Los Feliz residence was later converted into a public library), while his mother worked several jobs.[5] DiCaprio attended Seeds Elementary School (now UCLA Lab School) and John Marshall High School a few blocks away, after attending the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies for four years.[15] However, he dropped out of high school following his third year, eventually earning his general equivalency diploma (GED).[16][17] DiCaprio spent part of his childhood in Germany with his maternal grandparents, Wilhelm and Helene. He is conversant in German and Italian.[18][19][20]\\r\\nDiCaprio was also a contestant on the children's game show Fun House. One of the stunts he performed on the show was going fishing in a small pool of water by catching the fish only with his teeth.[21]\\r\\nDiCaprio's career began with his appearance in several commercials and educational films. After being removed from the set of children's television series Romper Room for being disruptive at the age of five,[22] he followed his older stepbrother Adam Farrar into television commercials, landing an ad for Matchbox cars at 14.[22] In 1990, he got his break on television when he was cast in the short-lived series based on the movie Parenthood. After Parenthood, DiCaprio had bit parts on several shows, including The New Lassie and Roseanne, as well as a brief stint on the soap opera Santa Barbara, playing the young Mason Capwell. His involvement in Parenthood and the daily soap earned him a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor each.[23]\\r\\nDiCaprio's debut film role was in the comedic sci-fi horror film Critters 3, in which he played the stepson of an evil landlord, a role that DiCaprio described as \\"your average, no-depth, standard kid with blond hair.\\"[24] Released in 1991, the movie went direct-to-video.[24] Soon after, he became a recurring cast member on the ABC sitcom Growing Pains, playing Luke Brower, a homeless boy who is taken in by the Seaver family. DiCaprio made his big screen breakthrough in 1992, when he was handpicked by Robert De Niro out of 400 young actors to play the lead role in This Boy's Life.[22]\\r\\nLater in 1993, DiCaprio co-starred as the mentally handicapped brother of Johnny Depp's character in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, a comic-tragic odyssey of a dysfunctional Iowa family. Director Lasse Hallstr?m admitted he was initially looking for a less good-looking actor but finally settled on DiCaprio as he had emerged as \\"the most observant actor\\" among all auditionees.[24] Budgeted at US$11 million,[25] the film became a critical success, resulting in various accolades for DiCaprio, who was awarded the National Board of Review Award and nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for his portrayal. New York Times critic Janet Maslin praised DiCaprio's performance, writing \\"the film's real show-stopping turn comes from Mr. DiCaprio, who makes Arnie's many tics so startling and vivid that at first he is difficult to watch. The performance has a sharp, desperate intensity from beginning to end.\\"[26]\\r\\nDiCaprio's first effort of 1995 was Sam Raimi's The Quick and the Dead, a western film. Sony Pictures was dubious over DiCaprio's casting, and as a result, co-star Sharon Stone decided to pay the actor's salary herself.[27] The film was released to a dismal box office performance, barely grossing US$18.5 million in the US, and received mixed reviews from critics.[28] DiCaprio next starred in Total Eclipse, a fictionalized account of the homosexual relationship between Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. He replaced River Phoenix, who died during pre-production on the project.[29] A minor art-house success, the film grossed US$0.34 million throughout its domestic theatrical run.[30]\\r\\nDiCaprio appeared in the mostly improvised short film called Don's Plum, as a favor to aspiring director R. D. Robb.[22] When Robb decided to expand the black-and-white film to feature length, however, DiCaprio and costar Tobey Maguire had its release blocked by court order, arguing that they never intended to make it a theatrical release, as it would have commercial value thanks to their stardom.[22] The film eventually premiered at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival, where it was well received by critics.[31] DiCaprio's last film of the year 1995 was The Basketball Diaries, a biographical film about Jim Carroll.[32]\\r\\nIn 1996, DiCaprio appeared opposite Claire Danes in Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet, an abridged modernization of William Shakespeare's romantic tragedy of the same name, which retained the original Shakespearean dialogue. The project achieved a worldwide box office take of $147 million.[33]\\r\\nLater that year, he starred in Jerry Zaks' family drama Marvin's Room, reuniting with Robert De Niro. Based on Scott McPherson's screenplay adaptation of his own 1991 stage play of the same name, the film revolves around two sisters, played by Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton, who are reunited through tragedy after 17 years of estrangement.[34] DiCaprio portrayed Hank, Streep's character's troubled son, who has been committed to a mental asylum for setting fire to his mother's house.[35]\\r\\nIn 1997, DiCaprio starred in James Cameron's Titanic (1997) as twenty-year-old Jack Dawson, a penniless Wisconsin man who wins two tickets for the third-class on the ill-fated RMS Titanic. DiCaprio initially refused to portray the character but was eventually encouraged to pursue the role by Cameron, who strongly believed in his acting ability.[36] Against expectations, the film went on to become the highest-grossing film to date (it was surpassed in 2010 by Cameron's film Avatar), grossing more than $1.843 billion in box-office receipts worldwide,[37] and transformed DiCaprio into a commercial movie superstar, resulting in fan worship among teenage girls and young women in general that became known as \\"Leo-Mania\\".[38] In May 1998, for example, his face appeared on the covers of at least four teen magazines, and three books about DiCaprio were among the top six paperbacks on The New York Times Best Seller list.[39] More than 200 fans contacted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to protest his not being nominated for the 70th Academy Awards.[40] He was nominated for other high-profile awards, including a second Golden Globe nomination. Upon the success of Titanic, DiCaprio stated in 2000: \\"I have no connection with me during that whole Titanic phenomenon and what my face became around the world [...] I'll never reach that state of popularity again, and I don't expect to. It's not something I'm going to try to achieve either.\\"[41]\\r\\nThe following year, DiCaprio made a self-mocking cameo appearance in Woody Allen's caustic satire of the fame industry, Celebrity (1998). That year, he also starred in the dual roles of the villainous King Louis XIV and his secret, sympathetic twin brother Philippe in Randall Wallace's The Man in the Iron Mask, based on the same-titled 1939 film. Despite receiving a rather mixed to negative response,[42] the film became a box office success, grossing US$180 million internationally.[43] Though DiCaprio's performance was generally well-received, with Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman writing that \\"the shockingly androgynous DiCaprio looks barely old enough to be playing anyone with hormones, but he's a fluid and instinctive actor, with the face of a mischievous angel,\\"[44] he was awarded a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Couple for both incarnations the following year.[45]\\r\\nDiCaprio's next project was the drama film The Beach (2000), an adaption of Alex Garland's 1996 novel of the same name. He played an American backpacking tourist looking for the perfect way of life in a secret island commune in the Gulf of Thailand. Budgeted at $US50 million, the film became a financial success, grossing $US144 million worldwide,[46] but as with DiCaprio's previous project, the film was negatively reviewed by critics.[47] Todd McCarthy of Variety noted that \\"Richard [DiCaprio's role] is too much the American Everyman and not enough of a well-defined individual to entirely capture one's interest and imagination, and DiCaprio, while perfectly watchable, does not endow him with the quirks or distinguishing marks to make this man from nowhere a dimensional character.\\"[48] The next year, he was nominated for another Razzie Award for his work on the film.\\r\\nDiCaprio's first film of 2002 was the biographical crime drama film Catch Me If You Can, based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., who, before his 19th birthday, used his charm, confidence, and several different personas, to make millions in the 1960s writing bad checks. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film was shot in 147 different locations in only 52 days, making it \\"the most adventurous, super-charged movie-making\\" DiCaprio had experienced yet.[49] Catch Me If You Can received favorable reviews and proved to be an international success, becoming DiCaprio's highest-grossing film since Titanic with a total of US$351.1 million worldwide.[50] Roger Ebert praised his performance, and noted that while \\"DiCaprio, who in recent films [...] has played dark and troubled characters, is breezy and charming here, playing a boy who discovers what he is good at, and does it.\\"[51] The following year, DiCaprio received his third Golden Globe nomination for his work in the film.[52]\\r\\nAlso in 2002, DiCaprio appeared in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York, a historical film set in the mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City. Director Scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of realizing the film until DiCaprio became interested in playing protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, a young leader of the Irish faction, and thus, Miramax Films got involved with financing the project.[53] Nonetheless production on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director squabbles, resulting in a marathon eight-month shoot and, at US$103 million, the most expensive film Scorsese had ever made.[53] Upon its release, Gangs of New York became a financial and critical success.[54] DiCaprio's acting was well-received but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis' performance among most critics.[55][56]\\r\\nForging a collaboration with Scorsese, the two paired again for a biopic of the eccentric and obsessive American film director and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004). Centering on Hughes' life from the late 1920s to 1947, DiCaprio initially developed the project with Michael Mann, who decided against directing it after back-to-back film biographies in Ali and The Insider.[56] The actor eventually pitched John Logan's script to Scorsese, who quickly signed on to direct. The Aviator became a critical and financial success.[57] DiCaprio received rave reviews for his performance and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, also receiving another Academy Award nomination.[58][59]\\r\\nIn 2005, DiCaprio was made a commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture for his contributions to the arts.[60] The following year, the actor starred in both Blood Diamond and The Departed. In Edward Zwick's war film Blood Diamond, he starred as a diamond smuggler from Rhodesia who is involved in the Sierra Leone Civil War. The film itself received generally favorable reviews,[61] and DiCaprio was praised for the authenticity of his South African Afrikaner accent, known as a difficult accent to imitate.[62] In Scorsese's The Departed he played the role of Billy Costigan, a state trooper working undercover in an Irish Mob in Boston. Highly anticipated, the film was released to overwhelmingly positive reviews and became one of the highest-rated wide release films of 2006.[63] Budgeted at US$90 million, it also emerged as DiCaprio and Scorsese's highest-grossing collaboration to date, easily beating The Aviators previous record of US$213.7 million.[64] DiCaprio's performance in The Departed was applauded by critics and earned him a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor.[65] The same year, both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild nominated DiCaprio twice in the Best Actor category for both of his 2006 features, and in addition, DiCaprio earned his third Academy Award nomination for Blood Diamond.[66][67][68]\\r\\nIn 2008, DiCaprio starred in Body of Lies, a spy film based on the novel of the same name by David Ignatius, set in context of the Middle East and the War on Terror, telling the story of three men battling a terrorist organization, and each other.[69] Directed by Ridley Scott, DiCaprio dyed his hair brown and wore brown contacts for the role, which he chose to pursue because he considered it a throwback to political films of the 1970s such as The Parallax View (1974) and Three Days of the Condor (1975).[69] The film received mixed reviews from critics,[70] and at a budget of US$67.5 million, became a moderate box office success, grossing US$115 million worldwide.[71]\\r\\nThe same year, DiCaprio reunited with Kate Winslet to film the drama Revolutionary Road (2008), directed by Winslet's then-husband Sam Mendes. As both actors had been reluctant to make romantic films similar to Titanic, it was Winslet who suggested that both should work with her on a film adaptation of the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates after reading the script by Justin Haythe, knowing that plot had little in common with the 1997 blockbuster.[72] Once DiCaprio agreed to do the film, it went almost immediately into production.[73] He noted that he saw his character as \\"unheroic\\" and \\"slightly cowardly\\" and that he was \\"willing to be just a product of his environment.\\"[74] Portraying a couple in a failing marriage in the 1950s, DiCaprio and Winslet watched period videos promoting life in the suburbs to prepare themselves for Revolutionary Road, which eventually earned them favorable reviews.[75] For his portrayal DiCaprio garnered his seventh Golden Globes nomination.[76]\\r\\nDiCaprio continued his collaborative streak with Scorsese in the 2010 psychological thriller film Shutter Island (2010), based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. He played U.S. Marshal Edward \\"Teddy\\" Daniels, who is investigating a psychiatric facility located on an island and comes to question his own sanity. The film grossed $294 million.[77]\\r\\nAlso in 2010, DiCaprio starred in director Christopher Nolan's science-fiction film Inception, also starring Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe, Tom Berenger and Michael Caine. Inspired by the experience of lucid dreaming and dream incubation,[78] DiCaprio portrays the character of Dom Cobb, an \\"extractor\\" who enters the dreams of others to obtain information that is otherwise inaccessible. Cobb is promised a chance to regain his old life in exchange for planting an idea in a corporate target's mind.[79] DiCaprio was \\"intrigued by this concept? this dream-heist notion and how this character's gonna unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life.\\"[80] Released to critical acclaim, the film grossed over $825 million worldwide.[81] To star in this film, DiCaprio agreed to a pay cut from his $20 million fee, in favor of splitting first-dollar gross points, which means he receives money coming directly off the top of ticket sales. This risk paid off, with DiCaprio earning $50 million from the film to become his highest payday yet.[82] The movie went on to become Di Caprio's second highest-grossing movie with $293 million at the box office, after Titanic with $659 million and ahead of The Revenant with $184 million.[83]\\r\\nIn July 2010, it was announced that DiCaprio had pulled out of a Viking movie to be directed by Mel Gibson amid controversy over Gibson's rage-fueled rant tapes and domestic violence probe.[84]\\r\\nIn 2011, DiCaprio starred alongside Armie Hammer and Naomi Watts in Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar, a biopic about J. Edgar Hoover.[85] Written by Dustin Lance Black, the film focuses on the career of the FBI director from the Palmer Raids onwards, including an examination of his private life as an alleged closeted homosexual.[86] Reviews towards the film were mostly mixed, with many critics commending DiCaprio's performance but feeling that, overall, the film lacked coherence.[87] Roger Ebert praised DiCaprio's performance as a \\"fully-realized, subtle and persuasive performance, hinting at more than Hoover ever revealed, perhaps even to himself.\\"[88]\\r\\nIn 2012, DiCaprio starred as villainous Calvin Candie in Quentin Tarantino's spaghetti western, Django Unchained.[89] While filming Django Unchained, DiCaprio accidentally cut his hand on glass, but continued filming despite the injury, and Tarantino elected to use the take in the final movie.[90] The film received positive reviews from critics[91] and earned DiCaprio his ninth nomination from the Golden Globes.[92] Django Unchained grossed $424 million worldwide.[93]\\r\\nDiCaprio's next film was The Great Gatsby, again with Baz Luhrmann (who directed him in Romeo + Juliet in 1996), an adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel, also starring Carey Mulligan and Tobey Maguire; the film was released on May 10, 2013.[94][95] It received mixed reviews from critics,[96] however DiCaprio's portrayal as Jay Gatsby was praised. Critic Rafer Guzman of Newsday praised DiCaprio by stating, \\"As for Leonardo DiCaprio, he is now the Gatsby to beat. Despite a borderline comedic entrance ÿ haloed by fireworks and accompanied by Gershwin's \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\"DiCaprio nails this maddeningly enigmatic character. He's as tough as Alan Ladd in '49, as suave as Redford in '74, but also vulnerable, touching, funny, a faker, a human. You hear it all in Gatsby's favorite phrase, \\"old sport,\\" a verbal tic that stumped other actors. It's a tremendous, hard-won performance.\\"[97] Matt Zoller Seitz of Roger Ebert.com described his performance as Gatsby as \\"The movie's greatest and simplest special effect,\\" and states \\"This is an iconic performance  maybe his career best.\\"[98] The film grossed $348 million worldwide[99] and became Luhrmann's highest-grossing film.[100]\\r\\nDiCaprio reunited with Scorsese for the fifth time in The Wolf of Wall Street, a film based on the life of stockbroker Jordan Belfort, who was arrested in the late 1990s for securities fraud and money laundering.[101][102] Filming began on August 8, 2012, in New York,[103] and the film was released on December 25, 2013.[104] The role earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy and his fourth Academy Award nomination for acting. In January 2013, DiCaprio said he was going to take a long break from acting and would \\"fly around the world doing good for the environment.\\"[105]\\r\\nIn 2015, DiCaprio played fur trapper Hugh Glass in the survival drama The Revenant, directed by Alejandro G. I?rritu.[106] The film was well received by critics[107] and DiCaprio's performance garnered universal acclaim[108][109] that earned him numerous awards, including his first win at the Academy Awards in the Best Actor category,[110][111] his eleventh nomination and third win at Golden Globes in the Best Actor Drama category, and his first BAFTA award for Best Actor.[112]\\r\\nOn August 10, 2015, it was announced that Martin Scorsese will direct an adaptation of Erik Larson's The Devil in the White City, which will star DiCaprio with a screenplay to be written by Billy Ray.[113] In October 2015, Appian Way acquired the movie rights for a book about the Volkswagen emissions scandal.[114] On October 21, 2016, it was announced that DiCaprio will portray Sam Phillips, founder of Memphis-based Sun Studio, in the forthcoming film based on Peter Guralnick's book Sam Phillips: The Man Who Invented Rock N Roll.[115] In 2017, Paramount announced that it has acquired the movie rights for an English language adaptation of The Black Hand.[116] The new film, due for release in 2018, will star DiCaprio as Joe Petrosino, and will be partly based on Stephan Talty's novelization of Petrosino's assassination.[117][118] In August 2017, Paramount won a bidding war against Universal Pictures for the rights to adapt Walter Isaacson's biography of Leonardo da Vinci. The studio bought the rights under its deal with DiCaprio's Appian Way Productions, which said that it planned to produce the film with DiCaprio as the star.[119][120] As of September 2017, DiCaprio is set to star in Roosevelt, a biopic of former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt; Martin Scorsese will direct and Paramount Pictures will distribute, with DiCaprio's Appian Way producing.[121] The film does not yet have a release date. In January 2018, it was announced that DiCaprio is planned to star in Quentin Tarantino's upcoming film about the Manson Family murders.[122]\\r\\nDiCaprio's romantic relationships have been widely covered in the media.[123] In 1997 DiCaprio dated the British singer Emma Bunton.[124][125] He also dated the actress Bijou Phillips[126] and the models Kristen Zang and Emma Miller.[127] In 2000, he met Brazilian model Gisele Bndchen, whom he dated until 2005.[128] He was romantically involved with Israeli model Bar Refaeli from 2005 to 2011, during which time he met with Israeli president Shimon Peres and visited Refaeli's hometown of Hod HaSharon.[129][130]\\r\\nDiCaprio owns a home in Los Angeles and an apartment in Battery Park City, New York.[131] In 2009, he bought an island off mainland Belize, on which he is planning to create an eco-friendly resort.[132] In 2014, he purchased the original Dinah Shore residence designed by mid-century modern architect Donald Wexler in Palm Springs, California.[133]\\r\\nIn 2005, DiCaprio's face was severely injured when model Aretha Wilson hit him over the head with a broken bottle at a Hollywood party. After pleading guilty in 2010, Wilson was sentenced to prison for two years.[127]\\r\\nDuring the 2004 presidential election, DiCaprio campaigned and donated to John Kerry's presidential bid. The FEC showed that DiCaprio gave $2,300 to Barack Obama's presidential campaign in the 2008 election, the maximum contribution an individual could give in that election cycle, and $5,000 to Obama's 2012 campaign.[134]\\r\\nDiCaprio is agnostic.[135]\\r\\nFollowing the success of Titanic in 1997 along with earlier films, 24-year-old DiCaprio established the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation in 1998, a non-profit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness.[136] Although concerned with all areas of the environment, it focuses on global warming, preserving Earth's biodiversity and supporting renewable energy. It has worked on projects in over 40 countries and has produced two short web documentaries, Water Planet and Global Warning.[137] The foundation has also funded debt-for-nature swaps.[138][139]\\r\\nBecause of his active involvement in those causes, he has received praise from environmental groups.[140] Among the accolades received were the Martin Litton Environment Award, in 2001, from Environment Now, and the Environmental Leadership Award in 2003 from Global Green USA.[141]\\r\\nDiCaprio chaired the national Earth Day celebration in 2000, where he interviewed President Bill Clinton and they discussed plans to deal with global warming and the environment.[142] In 2007 he had a major role in The 11th Hour, a documentary about people's relationship to nature and global warming. He co-produced, co-wrote and narrated the film.[142] From a benefit \\"11th Hour\\" fine art auction he organized in 2013, he raised nearly $40 million to toward his foundation. He told attendees, \\"Bid as if the fate of the planet depended on us.\\"[143] It became the world's highest-grossing environmental charity event ever held.[144] DiCaprio states that global warming is the world's \\"number-one environmental challenge\\".[145]\\r\\nIn July 2016 his foundation awarded $15.6 million to help protect wildlife and the rights of Native Americans, along with combating climate change.[146] And in July 2017, a charity auction and celebrity concert put on by the foundation had raised over $30 million in its opening days and was set to continue the following month.[147]\\r\\nHe has been an active supporter of numerous environmental organizations and has sat on the board of the World Wildlife Fund, Global Green USA, International Fund for Animal Welfare and the Natural Resources Defense Council.[137][148] He traveled to Indonesia in early 2016 where he criticized the government's palm oil industry's slash-and-burn forest clearing methods.[149][150]\\r\\nAt the 2007 Oscar ceremony, DiCaprio and former Vice President Al Gore appeared to announce that the Academy Awards had incorporated environmentally intelligent practices in its production. He presented at the 2007 American leg of Live Earth, and in 2010 his environmental work earned DiCaprio a nomination for the VH1 Do Something Award, honoring people who do good.[151] In 2014 he was appointed as a United Nations representative on climate change, and later that year he made an opening statement to members of the UN Climate Summit.[152][153] He again spoke at the UN in April 2016 prior to the signing of Paris Climate Change Agreement.[154]\\r\\nDiCaprio is a vegetarian[155], rumored to even be vegan,[156] and in 2014 he backed the documentary Cowspiracy about the impact of animal agriculture on the environment and the positions of several environmental organizations on the issue.[157] By taking the role of executive producer, DiCaprio helped the documentary get released on Netflix.[158][159]\\r\\nHe also executive-produced and appeared in Before the Flood, a 2016 documentary film examining various aspects of global warming.[160]\\r\\nIn accepting his Best Actor award at the 2016 Oscars ceremony, DiCaprio stated:\\r\\nClimate change is real, it is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters, but who speak for all of humanity, for the indigenous people of the world, for the billions and billions of underprivileged people out there who would be most affected by this. For our childrens children, and for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed.[161]\\r\\nDiCaprio has owned environment-friendly electric-hybrid vehicles[162] and his home is powered by solar panels[140], although his use of private jets and large yachts has attracted criticism due to their large carbon footprints.[163][164]\\r\\nIn November 2010, DiCaprio donated $1 million to the Wildlife Conservation Society at Russia's tiger summit. DiCaprio's persistence in reaching the event after encountering two plane delays caused then Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to describe him as a \\"muzhik\\" or \\"real man\\".[165][166] In 2011, DiCaprio joined the Animal Legal Defense Fund's campaign to free Tony, a tiger who has spent the last decade at the Tiger Truck Stop in Grosse Tte, Louisiana.[167]\\r\\nIn early 2016, at a meeting with Pope Francis, he gave a charity donation and spoke about environmental issues. A few days later, possibly influenced by his meeting with DiCaprio, the Pope said he would act in a planned faith-based charity film, Beyond the Sun. It would be his first acting experience, and would also be the first time in history that a Pope appeared in a feature film. Profits from the film would be given to charities in Argentina.[168]\\r\\nIn October 2016, DiCaprio joined forces with Mark Ruffalo in North Dakota in support of the Standing Rock tribes opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline.\\r\\nIn April 2017, he promoted and protested President Trump's inaction on climate change by attending the 2017 People's Climate March.[169][170]Leonardo DiCaprio?is identified?as one of the most active celebrities in the climate change movement. Not only did he highlight the topic at the Oscars but he is a constant source of information on the matter.[171]Many political figures welcome high-profile influencers such as?actors?as Leonardo DiCaprio?or?artists to address political causes, environmental or not, because of the high recognition that celebrities have, states Eric T. Kasper, an associate professor of political science. He claims that much of the public feel a personal connection to the stars after experiencing emotion from them in so many different ways on the big screens.?[172]While?budgets in the science and technology sector are declining as well as interest in newspapers and scientific journal series, it is important to have more familiar faces and voices such of those from celebrities to represent the importance of subjects such as climate change.[173]\\r\\nIn 1998, DiCaprio and his mother donated $35,000 for a \\"Leonardo DiCaprio Computer Center\\" at the Los Feliz branch of the Los Angeles Public Library, the site of his childhood home. It was rebuilt after the 1994 Northridge earthquake and opened in early 1999.[174] During the filming of Blood Diamond, DiCaprio worked with 24 orphaned children from the SOS Children's Village in Maputo, Mozambique, and was said to be extremely touched by his interactions with the children.[175] In 2010, he donated $1 million to relief efforts in Haiti after the earthquake.[176]\\r\\nIn April 2013, DiCaprio donated $61,000 to GLAAD, an organization which promotes the image of LGBT people in the media.[177]","input":"Who did leonardo dicaprio play in the titanic?"},{"output":"English","context":"Fiji has three official languages under the 1997 constitution (and not revoked by the 2013 Constitution): English, Fijian and Hindi. Fijian is spoken either as a first or second language by indigenous Fijians who make up around 54% of the population. Fijians of Indian descent make up a further 37%, mainly speaking a local variant of Hindi, known as Fiji Hindi. English, a remnant of British colonial rule over the islands, was the sole official language until 1997 and is widely used in government, business, and education as a lingua franca; considerable business is also done in Fijian, especially away from larger town centre.\\r\\nA small number of other indigenous East Fijian and West Fijian regional languages are spoken on the islands, standard Fijian belonging to the East Fijian group. Rotuman and Chinese are also spoken by immigrant populations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 19th century, Fiji's population consisted almost entirely of indigenous Fijians, who were of mixed Polynesian and Melanesian descent and generally spoke languages of the Malayo-Polynesian language family. After the islands came under British colonial rule, a number of contract workers were brought from present-day British India, thus giving the reason for the spreading of Hindi language. Significantly, all three of Fiji's official languages have greatly been influenced by one another, in terms of vocabulary and, in some cases, grammar because of the constant, everyday contact between these languages, now for over a century. Furthermore, Fiji's diverse, multiracial and multilingual makeup make these languages, as well as other unofficial, minority languages in Fiji (such as Western Fijian, Chinese, Banaban, Rotuman, Tuvaluan and other present Indian languages), influence one another.\\r\\nEnglish usage in Fiji predates the cession of Fiji to Great Britain by a few decades. English was first encountered from the first explorers and traders and found greater popularity as a lingua franca (albeit mixed with English in an early and now extinct Pidgin Fijian) between frontier settlers and the indigenous peoples. By the time of the British administration, much of the Fijian nobility were able to comprehend basic English. The English spoken in Fiji today is very different and has developed significantly over the close to 150 years of usage in the islands.\\r\\nLike many former colonies of Great Britain, there are certain 'situational varieties' of English present. There is the very formal, 'Proper' English (which would resemble formal English in Australia or the United Kingdom) as it is known, which is to be used in government and any other situation deemed formal enough for its use, but it has fallen out of favor due to the popularity of the more laid back varieties and is still spoken only by the older generation that lived through the colonial days. A sort of mid-level English is used in school, church, work and in semi-formal situations and is basically English with localized grammatical innovations and words imported from Hindi and Fijian; it is quickly becoming 'formal English' in Fiji. Last is the very informal Fiji English, or Finglish, which is used among all races with family, friends and often nowadays, in general conversations and in any other situation not deemed formal. Fiji English has been tentatively studied by linguists and has been suggested as a separate dialect from Standard English (as has developed in Australia and New Zealand) but the distinction is not made locally or in the constitution. Moreover, other linguists suggest it is part of a greater South Pacific English dialect because of the shared development of English within former British colonies and protectorates in the South Pacific.\\r\\nFijian is an Austronesian language of the Malayo-Polynesian family spoken in Fiji. It has 300,000 first-language speakers, which is more than half the population of Fiji, but another 300,000 speak it as a second language. The early missionaries selected the Bau dialect or Bauan (which, among the East Fijian dialects, held the place that French would in Europe, while the purer Rewa dialect would be Latin) as the standard dialect for printing and communicating. Bauan soon became the standard of communication among the indigenous iTaukei. Bauan was selected not only because of its prestige but also because it was the language of the then politically dominant island of Bau and the Mataiwelagi chiefs (and claimed King of Fiji).\\r\\nBy the middle to the late 19th century, with the push by missionaries, Bauan had also invaded the Western areas of Viti Levu, which spoke an entirely different set of dialects belonging to the West Fijian language, which is grouped with Polynesian and Rotuman in the West Fijian-Polynesian language family and practiced a different culture. This occurred up to the point that many Bauan words entered many western Fijian languages. Bauan was then adopted by the British administration for communication with the iTaukei. Over time, it evolved into what is today Standard Fijian which includes many English and Other Fijian Dialectal contributions, becoming quite distinct from the original Bauan Dialect.[1]\\r\\nHindi is an official language in Fiji. In the 1997 Constitution, it was referred to it as \\"Hindustani\\",[2] but in the 2013 Constitution of Fiji, it is simply called \\"Hindi\\".[3]\\r\\nFiji Hindi, also known as Fijian Baat or Fijian Hindustani, is the language spoken by most Fijian citizens of Indian descent. It is derived mainly from the Awadhi and Bhojpuri varieties of Hindi. It has also borrowed a large number of words from Fijian and English. The relation between Fiji Hindi and Standard Hindi is similar to the relation between Afrikaans and Dutch. Indian indentured labourers were initially brought to Fiji mainly from districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, North-West Frontier and South India such as from Andhra and Tamil Nadu. They spoke numerous, mainly Hindi, dialects and languages depending on their district of origin.\\r\\nA language soon developed in Fiji that combined the common elements of the Hindi dialects spoken in these areas with Fijian, Arabic, and English words; this has diverged significantly from the varieties of Hindi spoken on the Indian sub-continent. The development of Fiji Hindi was accelerated by the need for labourers speaking different dialects and sub-dialects of Hindi to work together and the practice of young children being left during working hours in early versions of day care centers. Later, approximately 15,000 Indian indentured labourers, who were mainly speakers of Dravidian languages (Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam), were brought from South India. By this time Fiji Hindi was well established as the lingua franca of Fiji Indians and the South Indian labourers had to learn it to communicate with the more numerous North Indians. Inward migration of free Gujurati and Punjabi settlers further contributed to Fiji Hindi.\\r\\nFiji is also home to many smaller minorities which make up its multicultural and multilingual populace.\\r\\nRotuman, also referred to as Rotunan, Rutuman or F?eag Rotuma, is an Austronesian language spoken by the indigenous people of the South Pacific island group of Rotuma, an island with a Polynesian-influenced culture that was incorporated as a dependency into the Colony of Fiji in 1881 and later chose to remain with Fiji in 1970 upon independence and in 1987, when Fiji became a republic. The rotuman language is spoken by more than 2000 people on the island of Rotuma and a further 10,000 people who live or work in the Republic of Fiji.\\r\\nOther Indian languages are spoken in Fiji. After the indenture system, Indians who spoke Gujarati and Punjabi arrived in Fiji as free immigrants. At present, many free settler descendants in Fiji and their families speak Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi and Gujarati at home, but all speak and communicate with each other in Fijian Hindi.[citation needed]\\r\\nTwo significant languages that are seeing growth are Cantonese Chinese and Mandarin Chinese. Many Chinese settlers, especially from southern China speak Cantonese, which is quickly incorporating many Fijian and English words. Many of these migrants are farmers and are constantly exposed to the Fijian and Hindi dominated areas of rural Fiji.\\r\\nFurthermore, sizeable minorities of Micronesians and Polynesians mean that Fiji is also home to various Micronesian and Polynesian languages. Significant among them are the Banaban, which is the language of the former residents of Ocean Island, which was decimated through British phosphate mining. They were given Rabi Island in North-Eastern Fiji as a new homeland and number 2000-3000. Also, Kioa, which was given to former Tuvaluans, who migrated as the consequence of overcrowding on Vaitupu. They speak Tuvaluan, a Polynesian language and number around a thousand. Also, there are many Tongan residents and Fijians of Tongan descent in Fiji. These groups speak the Tongan language or a mix of Tongan and Fijian.\\r\\nClick on a coloured area to see an article about English in that country or region","input":"What is the main language spoken in fiji?"},{"output":"LA Fitness","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nLA Fitness International LLC (doing business as LA Fitness) is an American gym chain with more than 700 clubs across the United States and Canada.

The tallest guyed structure is the KVLY-TV mast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, an organization that certifies buildings as the \\"World's Tallest\\", recognizes a building only if at least 50% of its height is made up of floor plates containing habitable floor area.[1] Structures that do not meet this criterion, such as the CN Tower, are defined as \\"towers\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are dozens of radio and television broadcasting towers which measure over 600?metres (about 2,000?ft) in height, and only the tallest are recorded in publicly available information sources.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assessment of the height of artificial structures has been controversial. Various standards have been used by different organizations which has meant that the title of world's tallest structure or building has changed depending on which standards have been accepted. The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat has changed its definitions over time. Some of the controversy regarding the definitions and assessment of tall structures and buildings has included the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin an accepted definition of a building further controversy has included the following factors:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis category does not require the structure to be \\"officially\\" open but does require it to be \\"topped out\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tallest artificial structure is Burj Khalifa, a skyscraper in Dubai that reached 829.8?m (2,722?ft) in height on January 17, 2009.[2] By April 7, 2008 it had been built higher than the KVLY-TV mast in North Dakota, USA.[3] That September it officially surpassed Poland's 646.38?m (2,120.7?ft) Warsaw radio mast, which stood from 1974 to 1991, to become the tallest structure ever built. Guyed lattice towers such as these masts had held the world height record since 1954.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Petronius Platform stands 610?m (2,000?ft) off the sea floor leading some, including Guinness World Records 2007, to claim it as the tallest freestanding structure in the world. However, it is debated whether underwater height should be counted, in the same manner as height below ground is ignored on buildings. The Troll A platform is 472?m (1,549?ft), without any part of that height being supported by wires. The tension-leg type of oil platform has even greater below-water heights with several examples more than 1,000?m (3,300?ft) deep. However, these platforms are not considered constant structures as the vast majority of their height is made up of the length of the tendons attaching the floating platforms to the sea floor. Despite this, Guinness World Records 2009 listed the Ursa tension leg platform as the tallest structure in the world with a total height of 1,306?m (4,285?ft). The Magnolia Tension-leg Platform in the Gulf of Mexico is even taller with a total height of 1,432?m (4,698?ft).\\r\\n\\r\\nTaipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan, set records in three of the four skyscraper categories at the time it opened in 2004; at the time the Burj Khalifa opened in 2010 it remained the world's tallest inhabited building 509.2?m (1,671?ft) as measured to its architectural height (spire). The height of its roof 449.2?m (1,474?ft) and highest occupied floor 439.2?m (1,441?ft) had been surpassed by the Shanghai World Financial Center with corresponding heights of 487 and 474?m (1,598 and 1,555?ft). Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) was the highest in the final category: the greatest height to top of antenna of any building in the world at 527?m (1,729?ft).\\r\\n\\r\\nBurj Khalifa broke the height record in all four categories for completed buildings.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the disagreements over how to measure height and classify structures, engineers have created various definitions for categories of buildings and other structures. One measure includes the absolute height of a building, another includes only spires and other permanent architectural features, but not antennas. The tradition of including the spire on top of a building and not including the antenna dates back to the rivalry between the Chrysler Building and 40 Wall Street. A modern-day example is that the antenna on top of Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) is not considered part of its architectural height, while the spires on top of the Petronas Twin Towers are counted.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: The following table is a list of the tallest completed structure in each of the 53 categories below. There can only be one structure in each category, unless the title for the tallest is a draw.\\r\\n\\r\\n24426N 1014045E? / ?2.740486N 101.679069E? / 2.740486; 101.679069? (Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 Control Tower)\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some destroyed architectural structures which were taller than the tallest existing structure of their type. There are also destroyed structures omitted from this list that had been surpassed in height prior to being destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Mixed-Use is defined as having three or more real estate uses (such as retail, office, hotel, etc.) that are physically and functionally integrated in a single property and are mutually supporting.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 1998, the tallest building status was determined by the height of the building to the top of its architectural elements including spires, but not including \\"temporary\\" structures (such as antennas or flagpoles), which could be added or changed relatively easily without requiring major changes to the building's design. Other criteria for height measurement were not used. For this reason, the originally 1,451-foot (442-meter) to rooftop or 1518 feet with original antennas[12] Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) was generally accepted as being the tallest building continuously after its completion in 1973, and being taller than both World Trade Center towers, in spite of the fact the 1 World Trade Center Tower (North Tower) possessed a higher pinnacle absolute height after it added its 360-foot (110?m) radio antenna (total height of 1730 feet or 527.3 meters) in 1978. The 1 World Trade Center building maintained a higher absolute height to antenna top until the Sears Tower enlarged its own radio antenna in 2000 to a total height of 1730 feet.[12] However, the Willis Tower was always considered the taller building because it still possessed a greater height to its architectural top (1451 feet vs. 1362 feet), and thus its status as the world's tallest was generally not contested.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther historic cases in which a building with a taller absolute pinnacle height was not considered the tallest building include, in 1905 when the former New York Times building or The Times Square Building (at 229 West 43rd Street in New York) was completed at 111?m (364?ft) to the roof with 128?m (420?ft) including a flagpole. That building was never considered to be taller than the 119-metre-high (390?ft) then-current record-holder Park Row Building of New York because a flagpole is not an integral architectural part of a building.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 1998 the tallest building status had been contested on occasion, but the disputes did not result in a change of the criteria used to determine the world's tallest building. An example was the rivalry between the Trump Building (then known as the Bank of Manhattan Building) and the Chrysler Building. The Bank of Manhattan Building employed only a short spire and was 927?ft (283?m) tall and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very large 125-foot (38?m) spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world's tallest building with a total height of 1,048 feet (319?m), despite having a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings' spires are not counted in their heights. Upset by Chryslers victory, Shreve & Lamb, the consulting architects of Bank of Manhattan building, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor. They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly 100 feet (30?m) above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and essentially inaccessible.[14] However, the Chrysler Building was generally accepted as the tallest building in the world despite their protests.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, none of the previous discrepancies or disputes in criteria to measure height (spires vs antennas, absolute pinnacle height vs. architectural height, height of highest occupied floor, etc.) resulted in the controversy that occurred upon the completion of the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1998. The Petronas Towers possessed a higher architectural height (spires, but not antennas), but a lower absolute pinnacle height and lower top occupied floor than the previous record-holder Willis Tower in Chicago, United States. Counting buildings as structures with floors throughout, and with antenna masts excluded, Willis Tower was still considered the tallest at that time. When the Petronas Twin Towers were built, controversy arose because their spires extended nine metres higher than the roof of Willis Tower. Excluding their spires, the Petronas Towers are not taller than Willis Tower. At their convention in Chicago, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) found the Willis Tower to be the third-tallest building, and the Petronas Towers to be the world's tallest buildings. This decision caused a considerable amount of controversy in the news media because this was the first time a country outside the United States had held the worlds tallest building record.[13] Therefore, the CTBUH revised their criteria and defined four categories in which the world's tallest building can be measured,[15] by retaining the old criterion of height to architectural top, and adding three new categories:[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe height-to-roof criterion was discontinued because relatively few modern tall buildings possess flat rooftops, making this criterion difficult to determine and measure.[17] The CTBUH has further clarified their definitions of building height, including specific criteria concerning subbasements and ground level entrances (height measured from lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance rather than from a previously undefined \\"main entrance\\"), building completion (must be topped out both structurally and architecturally, fully clad, and  able to be occupied), condition of the highest occupied floor (must be continuously used by people living or working and be conditioned, thus including observation decks, but not mechanical floors) and other aspects of tall buildings.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe height is measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance. At the time, the Willis Tower held first place in the second and third categories, the Petronas Towers held the first category, and the 1 World Trade Center building held the fourth with its antenna height to top of pinnacle.[13] In 2000, however, a new antenna mast was placed on the Willis Tower, giving it hold of the fourth category. On April 20, 2004, Taipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan, was completed. Its completion gave it the world record for the first three categories. On July 21, 2007 it was announced that Burj Khalifa had surpassed Taipei 101 in height, reaching 512?m (1,680?ft).\\r\\n\\r\\nSince being completed in early 2010, Burj Khalifa leads in all categories (the first building to do so). With a spire height of 829.8?m (2,722?ft), Burj Khalifa surpassed Taipei 101 as the tallest building to architectural detail and the Willis Tower as the tallest building to tip. It also leads in the category of highest occupied floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Burj Khalifa was completed, Willis Tower led in the fourth category with 527?m (1,729?ft), previously held by the World Trade Center until the extension of the Chicago tower's western broadcast antenna in 2000, over a year prior to the World Trade Center's destruction in 2001. Its antenna mast included, One World Trade Center measured 527.3?m (1,730?ft). The World Trade Center became the world's tallest building to be destroyed or demolished; indeed, its site entered the record books twice on September 11, 2001, in that category, replacing the Singer Building, which once stood a block from the World Trade Center site.[citation needed] A different superlative for skyscrapers is their number of floors. The World Trade Center set that at 110, and this was not surpassed for nearly four decades until the Burj Khalifa, which opened in 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nStructures such as the CN Tower, the Ostankino Tower and the Oriental Pearl Tower are excluded from these categories because they are not \\"habitable buildings\\", which are defined as frame structures made with floors and walls throughout.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nFreestanding structures must not be supported by guy wires, the sea or other types of support. It therefore does not include guyed masts, partially guyed towers and drilling platforms but does include towers, skyscrapers (pinnacle height) and chimneys.\\r\\n(See also history of tallest skyscrapers.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world's tallest freestanding structure on land is defined as the tallest self-supporting artificial structure that stands above ground. This definition is different from that of world's tallest building or world's tallest structure based on the percentage of the structure that is occupied and whether or not it is self-supporting or supported by exterior cables. Likewise, this definition does not count structures that are built underground or on the seabed, such as the Petronius Platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Visit world's tallest structure by category for a list of various other definitions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tallest freestanding structure on land is the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The building surpassed the height of the previous record holder, the 553.3?m (1,815?ft) CN Tower in Toronto, Ontario, on September 12, 2007. It was completed in 2010, with final height of 829.8?m (2,722?ft).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a list of structures that have held the title as the tallest freestanding structure on land.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable mentions include the Pharos (lighthouse) of Alexandria, built in the third century BC and estimated between 115ÿ135?m (377ÿ443?ft). It was the world's tallest non-pyramidal structure for many centuries. Another notable mention includes the Jetavanaramaya stupa in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, which was built in the third century, and was similarly tall at 122?m (400?ft). These were both the world's tallest or second-tallest non-pyramidal structure for over a thousand years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tallest secular building between the collapse of the Pharos and the erection of the Washington Monument may have been the Torre del Mangia in Siena, which is 102?m (335?ft) tall, and was constructed in the first half of the fourteenth century, and the 97-metre-tall (318?ft) Torre degli Asinelli in Bologna, also Italy, built between 1109 and 1119.\\r\\n\\r\\nTimeline of development of world's highest observation deck since inauguration of Eiffel Tower.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigher observation decks have existed on mountain tops or cliffs, rather than on tall structures. The Grand Canyon Skywalk, constructed in 2007, protrudes 21?m (70?ft) over the west rim of the Grand Canyon and is approximately 1,100?m (3,600?ft) above the Colorado River, making it the highest of these types of structures.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs most of the tallest structures are guyed masts, here is a timeline of world's tallest guyed masts, since the beginning of radio technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs many large guyed masts were destroyed at the end of World War II, the dates for the years between 1945 and 1950 may be incorrect. If Wusung Radio Tower survived World War II, it was the tallest guyed structure shortly after World War II.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowers include observation towers, monuments and other structures not generally considered to be \\"habitable buildings\\", they are meant for \\"regular access by humans, but not for living in or office work, and are self-supporting or freestanding, which means no guy-wires for support\\", meaning it excludes from this list of continuously habitable buildings and skyscrapers as well as radio and TV masts.\\r\\n\\r\\nBridge towers or pylons, chimneys, transmission towers, and most large statues allow human access for maintenance, but not as part of their normal operation, and are therefore not considered to be towers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tokyo Skytree, completed in February 2012, is 634?m (2,080?ft), making it the tallest tower, and second-tallest freestanding structure in the world.[27][28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a list of structures that have historically held the title as the tallest towers in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe list categories are:\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\n\\r\\nSource: Emporis","input":"What is the highest tower in the world?"},{"output":"Kenneth Wayne Jennings III","context":"Kenneth Wayne Jennings III (born May 23, 1974) is an American game show contestant and author. Jennings holds the record for the longest winning streak on the U.S. syndicated game show Jeopardy! and as being the second highest-earning contestant in game show history. In 2004, Jennings won 74 Jeopardy! games (in a row) before he was defeated by challenger Nancy Zerg on his 75th appearance. His total earnings on Jeopardy! are $3,196,300, consisting of $2,520,700 over his 74 wins, a $2,000 second-place prize in his 75th appearance, a $500,000 second-place prize in the Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions, a $100,000 win for second-place prize in the Jeopardy Battle of the Decades, as well as half of a $300,000 prize in the IBM Challenge, when he competed against Watson.\\r\\nDuring his first run of Jeopardy! appearances, Jennings earned the record for the highest American game show winnings. His total was surpassed by Brad Rutter, who defeated Jennings in the finals of the Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions (first aired on May 25, 2005), adding $2,000,000 to Rutter's existing Jeopardy! winnings. Jennings regained the record after appearing on several other game shows, culminating in an appearance on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? (first aired on October 10, 2008), though Rutter retained the record for highest Jeopardy! winnings and once again passed Jennings' total after his victory in the 2014 Jeopardy Battle of the Decades tournament.\\r\\nAfter his success on Jeopardy!, Jennings wrote about his experience and explored American trivia history and culture in his book Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs, published in 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in Edmonds, Washington, Jennings grew up in Seoul, South Korea (1981ÿ1992) and Singapore (1992ÿ1996), where his father worked for an international law firm and then as Asia Pacific Division Counsel of Oracle Corporation.[1] He watched Jeopardy! on American Forces Network television while growing up.[2]\\r\\nJennings went to Seoul Foreign School where he completed an International Baccalaureate diploma and then graduated with a degree in Computer Science and English at Brigham Young University, where he played on the school's quizbowl team for three and a half years. Jennings attended the University of Washington during his freshman year.[3]\\r\\nBefore 2003, Jeopardy! contestants were limited to five consecutive games. At the beginning of the show's 20th season (in 2003), the rules were changed to allow contestants to remain on the show as long as they continued to win.[4] After this rule change, and until Jennings' run, the record winning streak was set by Tom Walsh, who won $186,900 in eight games in January 2004.\\r\\nBefore his Jeopardy! appearance, Jennings was a member of BYU's Quiz Bowl Team.[5] Jennings' run began during Jeopardy!'s 20th season with the episode aired on June 2, 2004, in which he unseated two-time returning champion Jerry Harvey, and continued into season 21. In that first episode, Jennings's entire winning streak nearly ended before it even began. The Final Jeopardy answer was, \\"She's the first female track & field athlete to win medals in five different events at a single Olympics.\\" Jennings responded with \\"Who is Jones?\\" referring to Marion Jones (the shows were recorded before she was stripped of her medals as a result of admitted doping). Host Alex Trebek said, \\"We will accept that, in terms of female athletes, there aren't that many.\\" If the response had not been accepted, Jennings would have finished in third place, and challenger Julia Lazarus would have won the game instead. Jennings' run was interrupted by the off-season break in July until September, 2004 Kids' Week, the Tournament of Champions (aired from September 20, 2004 through October 1, 2004), the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election (aired on Tuesday November 2, 2004, pushing his weeks of episodes to air from Wednesday to Saturday) and the College Championship (aired from November 10, 2004 through November 23, 2004). He did not participate in the Tournament of Champions, as invitations are only extended to champions who have already been defeated (with the exception of the winner(s) of the College Championship), which Jennings had not yet been.\\r\\nOn November 30, 2004, Jennings' reign as Jeopardy! champion ended when he lost his 75th game to challenger Nancy Zerg.[6] Jennings responded incorrectly to both Double Jeopardy! Daily Doubles, causing him to lose a combined $10,200 ($5,400 and $4,800, respectively) and leaving him with $14,400 at the end of the round. As a result, for only the tenth time in 75 games, Jennings did not have an insurmountable lead going into the Final Jeopardy! round.[7] Only Jennings and Zerg, who ended Double Jeopardy! with $10,000, were able to play Final Jeopardy! as third-place contestant David Hankins failed to finish with a positive score after Double Jeopardy!.\\r\\nThe Final Jeopardy! category was Business & Industry, and the clue was \\"Most of this firm's 70,000 seasonal white-collar employees work only four months a year.\\" Jennings appeared perplexed during the time allowed to write a response, while Zerg finished her response quickly. Zerg responded correctly with \\"What is H&R Block?\\" and wagered $4,401 of her $10,000, giving her a $1 lead over Jennings with his response still to be revealed. Jennings incorrectly responded with \\"What is FedEx?\\" and lost the game with a final score of $8,799 after his $5,601 wager was deducted from his score. After his response was revealed to be incorrect, the audience audibly gasped. He was awarded $2,000 for his second-place finish, which gave him a final total of $2,522,700 for his run on Jeopardy!. Zerg, whom Jennings called a \\"formidable opponent,\\" finished in third place on the next show. The audience gave a standing ovation in honor of both contestants, and Trebek called Zerg a \\"giant killer\\" as Jennings embraced her.\\r\\nJennings' 75 matches took place over a span of 182 calendar days.\\r\\nHis losing episode can be seen on 2005 DVD release of Jeopardy: An Inside Look at America's Favorite Quiz Show, released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment\\r\\nJeopardy! implemented some backstage changes during Jennings' run. Normally, players only get a short time to practice, but more rehearsal time was added so that the new players could get comfortable with the buzzers. Additionally, the person who managed the buzzer system was changed.[8] In his book Brainiac, Jennings says that the consistency of the original manager's timing had given an increasing advantage to continuing players, and that the change made a noticeable difference in the second season that he was on the show. At one point, announcer Johnny Gilbert stopped announcing Jennings' total wins during the show's opening.\\r\\nOn December 1, 2004, the day after his defeat, Jeopardy! broke with tradition by having Jennings make a guest appearance at the start of the broadcast, during which host Alex Trebek acknowledged his success and enumerated the various game show records he had broken.\\r\\nJennings appeared in The Guinness Book of World Records under \\"Most cash won on a game show.\\"\\r\\nAccording to the Nielsen TV National People Meter, Jeopardy!'s ratings were 22% higher during Jennings' run than they were during the same period the previous year. For several weeks of the winnings streak, Jeopardy! was ranked as TV's highest-rated syndicated program.[9] By the end of Jeopardy!'s 20th season several weeks later, the show had surpassed Wheel of Fortune in the ratings but Wheel, which is usually paired with Jeopardy! in programming, also benefited from Jennings' streak.[10]\\r\\nJennings has received a good deal of American media coverage. After his 38th win on Jeopardy!, during the summer break between tapings, Jennings made a guest appearance on Live with Regis and Kelly. There Jennings revealed that he had failed to qualify for Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, once hosted by Regis Philbin. During that guest appearance, Jennings said, \\"Jeopardy! is a man's game... it's not like Millionaire.\\"[11]\\r\\nJennings appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to present Letterman's \\"Top Ten List\\" (Top ten ways to irritate Alex Trebek). He appeared again on the program on the night his final show was televised, in addition to interview segments airing that night on local late evening news programming and on Nightline. Barbara Walters selected Jennings as one of the \\"Ten Most Fascinating People of 2004\\" for her twelfth annual ABC News special, which aired on December 8, 2004. While on his media tour following his final game, Jennings taped a segment for Sesame Street. TV Guide featured a segment of \\"The Top Ten TV Moments of 2004\\", in which Jennings' loss placed third. On December 1, 2004, A&E aired an episode of Biography on Jennings and other Jeopardy! notables, including Frank Spangenberg and Eddie Timanus.\\r\\nOn December 28, 2004, Sony announced a 15-week, 75-show Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions. It featured Tournament of Champions, College Championship, and Teen Tournament winners from the show's 21-year run, as well as over 100 five-time champions. Jeopardy!'s executive producer, Harry Friedman, explained:\\r\\nThe 2003 rule change, which allows Jeopardy! players to keep playing until they're defeated, raised the question about how other five-time champions might have played under this rule. This tournament is an opportunity to give those past champions another chance to shine.\\r\\nThe field totaled 145 players including Jennings, who, unlike the other competitors, was automatically placed in the finals. The Ultimate Tournament of Champions offered substantial cash prizes; with a grand prize of $2,000,000 to the winner, $500,000 for the first runner-up, and $250,000 for the second runner-up. Guaranteed prize money was offered to all contestants.\\r\\nIn the final round of the Ultimate Tournament, Brad Rutter decisively defeated Jennings and Jerome Vered, with respective final scores of $62,000, $34,599, and $20,600. Jennings won the $500,000 prize for second place, but as a result of the Ultimate Tournament, Rutter temporarily displaced him as the highest overall winner of money on a game show. Jennings has said he is still happy with his second-place finish.\\r\\nFrom February 14ÿ16, 2011, Jeopardy's \\"IBM Challenge\\" featured the computer company's Watson against Jennings and Rutter in two matches played over three days.[12] The winner of the competition was Watson, winning $1 million for two charities, while Jennings was second and Rutter was third, receiving $300,000 and $200,000, respectively. Jennings and Rutter each pledged to donate half of their winnings to charity.\\r\\nThis was the first ever man-versus-machine competition in the show's history. At the end of the first episode, in which only the first match's Jeopardy! Round was aired, Rutter was tied with Watson at $5,000, while Jennings was in third with $2,000. After the second episode in which the first game was completed, Jennings remained at third with $4,800 while Rutter at second had $10,400.[13] The competition ended with Watson with $77,147, Jennings with $24,000, and Rutter with $21,600.[14] Below his response during the Final Jeopardy! Round, Jennings wrote on his screen \\"I for one welcome our new computer overlords.\\" It was the first time Rutter had been defeated against any human player, although the defeat is not on Rutter's Jeopardy! official record, as the competition was deemed an exhibition.\\r\\nJennings wrote about playing against Watson for Slate.[15]\\r\\nIn 2014, Jeopardy! aired a special 5-week Jeopardy! Battle of the Decades tournament. Jennings made it to the finals along with Brad Rutter and Roger Craig. Jennings placed second, winning a $100,000 prize, and Rutter won first place, securing a $1,000,000 prize.\\r\\nTaking advantage of the notoriety that Jennings's losing Final Jeopardy! answer afforded, H&R Block offered Jennings free tax planning and financial services for the rest of his life.[16] H&R Block senior vice president David Byers estimated that Jennings owed approximately $1.04 million in taxes on his winnings.[17][18]\\r\\nIn a 2011 Reddit IAmA, Jennings recalled how in 2004 the Democratic politicians Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid unsuccessfully asked Jennings to run for the United States Senate from Utah. Jennings commented, \\"That was when I realized the Democratic Party was f@#$ed in '04.\\"[19]\\r\\nJennings has written several books. Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs details his experiences on Jeopardy! and his research into trivia culture conducted after the completion of his run.[2] Ken Jennings's Trivia Almanac: 8,888 Questions in 365 Days, a hardcover book, is a compilation of trivia questionswith 3 categories and about 20 questions per day of the year.[20] Maphead: Charting the Wide, Weird World of Geography Wonks explores the world of map and geography enthusiasts.[21] Because I said so! is a humorous examination of 'The myths, tales & warnings every generation passes down to its kids'.[22] He also has written five books for his children's series, Junior Genius Guides. [23]\\r\\nJennings also had a column in Mental Floss magazine called \\"Six Degrees of Ken Jennings\\", in which readers submit two wildly different things and he has to connect them in exactly six moves, much in the same vein as the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game.[24] The column ran from November 2005[25] to the SeptemberÿOctober 2010 issue.[26]\\r\\nAccording to Variety.com, Jennings and television producer Michael Davies teamed up as executive producers on a new game show format for Comedy Central. According to Comedy Central execs, it was planned that Jennings would co-host and participate.[27] The series was planned to premiere late in 2005 or in the first quarter of 2006; as of April 2006, development had stalled, and the show's future remained uncertain. Jennings explained on his website that \\"Stephen Colbert's show was doing so well in its post-Daily Show spot that Comedy Central decided they weren't in the market for a quiz show anymore.\\" However, as of mid-2006, he was still shopping a potential game show titled, Ken Jennings vs. the Rest of the World.[28]\\r\\nJennings appeared on The Colbert Report on September 13, 2006. During the interview, Colbert discussed Jennings's book, Brainiac, and mocked him not knowing the number of pages the book contained. After Colbert coined a word to describe intellectual nerdiness, \\"poindexterity\\", Jennings was going back and forth of what is the correct noun for \\"poindexter.\\" Jennings noted, as he had done earlier that day on NPR's Talk of the Nation, that since his streak, people \\"seem to have an extra-hard trivia question\\" in case they run into him.[29]\\r\\nHe also appeared twice on NPR's Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! program. In his Feb. 25, 2006 appearance on the \\"Not My Job\\" segment, he answered all three questions correctly, winning for a listener Carl Kasell's voice on that person's home answering machine. Jennings stated, \\"This is the proudest moment of my game show life.\\"[30] On June 1, 2013, Jennings made his debut as a panelist on Wait Wait Don't Tell Me.\\r\\nEntertainment Weekly put his performance on its end-of-the-decade \\"best of\\" list, saying, \\"Answer: A software engineer from Utah, he dominated the quizfest for a record 74 shows in 2004, amassing $2,520,700. Question: Who is Ken Jennings?\\"[31]\\r\\nJennings made the news in July 2006 when an article in the New York Post by Michael Starr criticized Jennings for what Starr perceived as lack of loyalty and gratitude on Jennings' part, citing an open letter to the producers of Jeopardy! and host Alex Trebek that Jennings wrote on his blog.[32][33] Jennings responded on his blog by explaining that the blog entry was satirical in tone, saying, \\"[Starr] knows there's no way I was genuinely calling for angry bees and ventriloquist's dummies to be added to the Jeopardy! format. It's a humor piece, and one which gets its laughs from the outrageous non sequiturs it proposes, not the ripeness of its target for criticism.\\"[34] Jennings had already posted a more serious comment defending Trebek that remains on his website.[35]\\r\\nJennings appeared on the first two episodes of the NBC game show 1 vs. 100 on October 13 and 20, 2006 as a mob member. He incorrectly answered the question, \\"what color is the number 1 space on a standard roulette wheel?\\" as \\"black\\" instead of \\"red\\" in his second episode, eliminating him from the game. (He explained that he did not know the answer because his Mormon faith prohibits gambling.)[36] He left the show with $714.29, his share of a $35,000 prize shared among 49 Mob members. Jennings returned to the show for a special \\"Last Man Standing\\" episode aired on February 9, 2007. He was eliminated on the final question, which asked which of the three options had been married the most times; he answered King Henry VIII, while the correct answer was Larry King. This episode was the first time Jennings had a chance at a rematch against rival Brad Rutter, who was also part of the mob and was eliminated before Jennings.\\r\\nIn 2007, Jennings was invited to be a contestant on the game show Grand Slam hosted by Dennis Miller and Amanda Byram, also a Sony Pictures production. The show debuted on Game Show Network (GSN) on August 4, 2007, and featured sixteen former game-show winners in a single-elimination tournament. Jennings, seeded second behind Brad Rutter, won the tournament and became the 2007 Grand Slam Champion after defeating Ogi Ogas (a second-round winner against Rutter) in the finals. He earned $100,000 for his victory.\\r\\nJennings was a contestant on an episode of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? that aired on October 10, 2008, which held the possibility of exceeding Rutter's total game show winnings. After winning $500,000, enough to surpass Rutter's total, Jennings chose not to attempt the final $1,000,000 question, which would have deducted $475,000 from his winnings if he missed it. As is customary on the show, Jennings was then shown the question to see what would have happened, and he provided the correct answer. Had he risked his winnings and correctly answered the question, he would have become the show's second $1,000,000 winner.\\r\\nFrom 2008 to 2009, Jennings appeared on GSN on Fridays for the trivia game Stump the Master. Home viewers send questions via the GSN website. Four callers are put on hold and Jennings selects from one of the categories. The caller for the category he picked comes on the line and reads the question. If Jennings does not answer or is incorrect, the caller wins $1,000 or more. Any time Jennings is right, the jackpot is increased by $1,000. All callers are given a small prize, whether they participate on the air or not.\\r\\nJennings has appeared on multiple episodes of Doug Loves Movies, hosted by Doug Benson, and has won a few times.\\r\\nJennings also appeared on two other Sony Pictures Television game shows, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, as a frequent expert for the lifeline \\"Ask the Expert\\", and also taped a pilot for the proposed 2009 CBS revival of Sony's The $25,000 Pyramid.[37]\\r\\nJennings appeared on Millionaire in 2014 as a contestant during Guinness World Records Edition themed week, where he won $100,000 after deciding to walk away on his $250,000 question. If he had gone for it, he would have been right and would have won $250,000.[38]\\r\\nJennings appeared on the second-season premiere of 500 Questions on May 26, 2016[39] and was eliminated on the fourth question, leaving with no winnings.\\r\\nJennings appeared on an episode of @midnight aired May 15, 2017 during the fourth season, which he won. As a result, he served as the funniest person on the internet for May 16, 2017.[40]\\r\\nJennings won the rookie division of the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament (ACPT) in 2006.[41] In his first time competing, Jennings placed 37th overall. He also served as the award's presenter, becoming the first contestant to present an award to himself. He has not competed in the tournament since.\\r\\nJennings had a weekly trivia column Kennections in Parade magazine.[42] In it, five questions are posed and their answers are all connected to a mystery topic, which the readers are to guess. Parade ceased publishing the quiz in early 2015, and removed links to archived quizzes in March 2015. Kennections now appear in the online version of Mental Floss magazine.\\r\\nEvery Tuesday, Jennings sends an email out containing seven questions, one of which is designed to be Google-resistant.[43] Subscribers respond with the answers to all seven questions and the results are maintained on a scoreboard on Jennings' blog.[44] At times he chooses to run multi-week tournaments, awarding the top responder with all seven answers correct with such things as a signed copy of his newest book.\\r\\nPaste named his Twitter one of \\"The 75 Best Twitter Accounts of 2014\\" ranking it at #10.[45]\\r\\nJennings was the subject of some controversy for posting a tweet when he wrote \\"Nothing sadder than a hot person in a wheelchair.\\"[46][47][48][49]\\r\\nJennings again faced controversy when on November 10, 2015, he tweeted a joke about the death of Daniel Fleetwood, a lifelong Star Wars fan who died of cancer. Fleetwood's dying wish was to see Star Wars: The Force Awakens fearing he likely would not live to see the film when it opened in theaters in December 2015. An online campaign was started on his behalf and his wish was granted only days before he died. Jennings said \\"It can't be a good sign that every fan who has seen the new Star Wars movie died shortly thereafter.\\"[50]\\r\\nJennings once more faced controversy when on May 31, 2017 he tweeted a joke involving Barron Trump, the youngest child of U.S. President Donald Trump. According to TMZ, after 11-year-old Barron Trump saw an image of Kathy Griffin holding a bloody Trump mask, he believed it was real and screamed. Jennings wrote, \\"Barron Trump saw a very long necktie on a heap of expired deli meat in a dumpster. He thought it was his dad & his little heart is breaking.\\"[51] After the tweet garnered controversy, Jennings said, \\"The joke doesn't mock Barron. It mocks using him for political cover.\\"[52]\\r\\nOn September 7, 2017, HowStuffWorks unveiled a new show entitled Omnibus, co-hosted by Jennings and John Roderick, frontman of the indie-rock band The Long Winters. They will pick topics they fear might be lost to history and discuss them.[53]\\r\\nJennings agreed to a deal with Microsoft to promote its Encarta encyclopedia software (which was later discontinued). He is also engaged in speaking deals through the Massachusetts-based speakers agency American Program Bureau.[54] In 2005, Cingular Wireless (now AT&T) featured Jennings in commercials portraying him as having lots of \\"friends and family\\" (coming out of the woodwork, because he is now \\"stinking rich\\").\\r\\nUniversity Games produced a Can You Beat Ken? board game, in which players vie against each other and Jennings in an attempt to earn $2.6 million first. Each question in the game was asked to Jennings, and his answers, both correct and incorrect, are recorded on the cards.[55]\\r\\nKen Jennings is an active member of the trivia app, FleetWit, regularly playing in the live trivia races.[56] On average, he answers 89% of questions correctly and has won over $2,000.00 to date.[57]\\r\\nHe and his wife Mindy (ne Boam)[3] have a son, Dylan, born in 2002, and a daughter, Caitlin, born in 2006.[58]\\r\\nJennings currently resides in the Seattle metropolitan area. He has stated that he is an avid comic book and movie geek with a website listing his top 4,000 favorite movies. He also writes questions for, edits the literature and mythology categories of questions of, and is otherwise active in the National Academic Quiz Tournaments (NAQT), a quiz bowl organization;[59] in particular, he moderated (i.e., read questions) at the 2005, 2006, and 2009 NAQT National High School Tournaments in Chicago.\\r\\nDuring his Jeopardy! winning streak, Jennings was a software engineer for CHG Healthcare Services, a healthcare-placement firm in Holladay, Utah.[60]\\r\\nJennings regularly competes in LearnedLeague under the name \\"JenningsK\\".[61]","input":"Who was the longest running contestant on jeopardy?"},{"output":"unit of distance","context":"A city block, urban block or simply block is a central element of urban planning and urban design.\\r\\nA city block is the smallest area that is surrounded by streets. City blocks are the space for buildings within the street pattern of a city, and form the basic unit of a city's urban fabric. City blocks may be subdivided into any number of smaller land lots usually in private ownership, though in some cases, it may be other forms of tenure. City blocks are usually built-up to varying degrees and thus form the physical containers or 'streetwalls' of public space. Most cities are composed of a greater or lesser variety of sizes and shapes of urban block. For example, many pre-industrial cores of cities in Europe, Asia and the Middle-east tend to have irregularly shaped street patterns and urban blocks, while cities based on grids have much more regular arrangements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most cities of the world that were planned, rather than developing gradually over a long period of time, streets are typically laid out on a grid plan, so that city blocks are square or rectangular. Using the perimeter block development principle, city blocks are developed so that buildings are located along the perimeter of the block, with entrances facing the street, and semi-private courtyards in the rear of the buildings.[1] This arrangement is intended to provide good social interaction among people.[1]\\r\\nSince the spacing of streets in grid plans varies so widely among cities, or even within cities, it is difficult to generalize about the size of a city block. However, as reference points, the standard square blocks of Portland, Houston, and Sacramento are 264 by 264 feet (80?m G?80?m), 330 by 330 feet (100?m G?100?m), and 410 by 410 feet (120?m G?120?m) respectively (to the street center line). Oblong blocks range considerably in width and length. The standard block in Manhattan is about 264 by 900 feet (80?m G?274?m); and in some U.S. cities standard blocks are as wide as 660 feet (200?m). The blocks in Calgary, Canada, are 330 by 560 feet (100?m G?170?m), while those in Edmonton, Canada are 197 by 560 feet (60?m G?171?m).[2] The blocks in central Melbourne, Australia, are 330 by 660 feet (100?m G?200?m), formed by splitting the square blocks in an original grid with a narrow street down the middle. In Chicago, Illinois and Minneapolis, Minnesota, a typical city block is 660 by 330 feet (200?m G?100?m) (w G h),[3][4] meaning that 16 east-west blocks or 8 north-south blocks measure one mile.\\r\\nMany world cities have grown by accretion over time rather than being planned from the outset. For this reason, a regular pattern of even, square or rectangular city blocks is not so common among European cities, for example. An exception is represented by those cities that were founded as Roman military settlements, and that often preserve the original grid layout around two main orthogonal axes. One notable example is Turin, Italy. Following the example of Philadelphia, New York City adopted the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 for a more extensive grid plan. By the middle of the 20th century, the adoption of the uniform, rectilinear block subsides almost completely and more picturesque layouts prevailed, with random sized and either curvilinear or non-orthogonal blocks and corresponding street patterns.\\r\\nIn much of the United States and Canada, the addressing systems follow a block and lot number system, in which each block of a street is allotted 100 building numbers.\\r\\nThe concept of city block can be generalized as a superblock or sub-block.\\r\\nSuperblocks were popular during the early and mid-20th century, arising from modernist ideas in architecture and urban planning. Planning in this era was based upon the distance and speed scales for the automobile and discounted the pedestrian and cyclist modes, as obsolete transportation vehicles.[citation needed] A superblock is much larger than a traditional city block, with a greater setback for buildings, and is typically bounded by widely spaced, high-speed, arterial or circulating routes rather than by local streets. Superblocks are often found in suburbs or planned cities, or are the result of urban renewal of the mid-20th century, where a street hierarchy has replaced the traditional grid. In a residential area of a suburb, the interior of the superblock is typically served by dead-ended or looped streets. The discontinuous streets served the automobile as longer distances, and the extra fuel required to go between destinations, was not a concern, but at the pedestrian scale, the discontinuity of the roads added to the distance that must be traveled. The discontinuity inside the superblock forced car dependency, discouraged errand walking, and forced more traffic onto the fewer continuous streets, increasing demand for through streets, which led ultimately to these streets having more travel lanes added for cars, thereby making it more difficult for any pedestrian to cross such streets. In this way, superblocks cut up the city into isolated units, expanded automobile dominance, and made it impossible for pedestrians and cyclists to get anywhere outside of the superblock. Superblocks can also be found in central city areas, where they are more often associated with institutional, educational, recreational and corporate rather than residential uses.\\r\\nUrban planner Clarence Perry argued for use of superblocks and related ideas in his \\"neighborhood unit\\" plan, which aimed to organize space in a way that was more \\"pedestrian-friendly\\" and provided open plazas and other space for residents to socialize. Planners, today, now know that the street discontinuity and the multi-lane roads associated with superblocks have caused the decline of pedestrian and bicycle use every where this \\"sprawl\\" pattern is present. The traditional urban block diffused automobile traffic onto several narrower roads at slower speeds. This more finely connected network of narrower roads better allowed the pedestrian and cyclist realms to flourish. The superblock, at the scale only suitable for automobiles, and not pedestrians, was the means for ultimate automobile dominance by the end of the 20th century.[5] The same intention to facilitate pedestrian movement and socializing is captured by an influential 1989 conceptual design of a Pedestrian Pocket[6] (see diagram). It is, similarly, a superblock composed of nine normal city blocks clustered around a light rail station and a central open space. Its circulation pattern consists primarily of a dense pedestrian network which is complementary to but independent from the car network. Access by car is provided by means of three loops. This superblock differs from Perry's concept in that it makes it impossible for cars to traverse it rather than very difficult; it is car-impermeable.\\r\\nIn the 1930s, superblocks were often used in urban renewal public housing projects in American cities.[7] In using superblocks, housing projects aimed to eliminate back alleys, which were often associated with slum conditions.[7]\\r\\nSuperblocks are also used when functional units such as rail yards or shipyards, inherited from the 19th and early 20th centuries, are too big to fit in an average city block. A contemporary function which reflects ancient practices that also requires larger than typical blocks is the sports stadium or arena. Just as the Colosseum in ancient Rome, sports complexes require superblocks. The Providence Park stadium in Portland, for example, takes up four normal city blocks as does the equally large Greensboro Coliseum in North Carolina. Other contemporary institutions, establishments or functions that use superblocks are: city halls like Government Center, Boston and Toronto City Hall; regional general hospitals or specialized medical centres; convention and exhibition centers, such as Exhibition Place in Toronto and the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center; and downtown enclosed Shopping Malls such as Eaton Centre in Toronto, echoing the large gallerias of the 19th century. Cultural complexes, such as the Lincoln Center in New York City, often occupy a superblock achieved through the consolidation of regular city blocks. A recent[when?] superblock user is the merchandise distribution centre, which can range in area from one to ten city blocks.\\r\\nMost notably, however, the largest superblocks in contemporary cities are used by university and college campuses[citation needed] such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Illinois at Chicago, the City College of New York, Columbia University and the University of Alberta in Edmonton. The \\"campus\\" impact on the city block structure is quite prominent particularly in small university towns such as Waterloo, Ontario or Ithaca, New York where the university superblock counts for a sizeable portion of the total city area. Campuses, in general, are fully walkable and sociable environments within the superblock structure. On some university campuses the extensive and exclusive pedestrian path network at grade is supplemented with below grade paths. New Urbanists would argue that separating circulation modes effectively kills the social interaction that bolsters urban areas.[citation needed]\\r\\nAdditional users of the superblock concept are large national or multinational corporations who constructed campuses in the late 1900s and 2000s. Examples of superblock campuses include Google in Mountain View, California; and Apple and Hewlett-Packard in San Jose, California. Another well-known commercial superblock is the World Trade Center site in New York City, where several streets of Manhattan's downtown grid were removed and de-mapped to make room for the center.\\r\\nSocial and housing agencies in the U.S., Canada and the UK used the superblock model for large housing projects such as Regent Park in Toronto and Benny Farm in Montreal, Canada. In New York City, the Stuyvesant Town private market, residential development superblock takes up about 18 normal city blocks and provides a large green amenity for its residents and neighbours. It uses crescent (loop) rather than dead-ended streets inside the superblock and an extensive network of paths that provide excellent connectivity within the block and to the neighbouring areas (see drawing).\\r\\nWhere the superblock is used for housing projects like Stuyvesant Town, the advantages sought are an improved separation of vehicular and pedestrian circulation, enhanced tranquility and reduced accident risk within the neighbourhood. In 2003, Vauban (a rail suburb of Freiburg, Germany) was constructed with similar goals.[8] Its layout consists mainly of a superblock with a central pedestrian spine and a few narrow looped and dead-ended streets. The British new town of Milton Keynes is built around a grid of one-kilometre square superblocks (see drawing).\\r\\nVirtual, unplanned superblocks have emerged in many cities worldwide as the outcome of stepwise modifications to streets and traffic. Most such superblocks have occurred in European city centres where the street network originates in the medieval or earlier periods. Not only is the street pattern labyrinthine, but also numerous streets that constitute it have dimensions incapable of accommodating two crossing cars or one car and pedestrians, excluding the need for parking or emergency access. Such geometric constraints and the resulting chaotic traffic conditions, along with deteriorating air quality, forced cities to remove motorized traffic from such streets. In certain cases, such as the city of Bremen, Germany, the cumulative effect of excluding motorized traffic from a number of streets made it impossible to cross the old city centre by car. The centre, however, remains completely traversable on foot or bicycle; a condition that resembles in principle the planned superblock and incorporates its design intentions. Some cities, such as Montpellier, France expanded the exclusion of traffic from the entire old centre.\\r\\nThe superblock concept has also been applied retroactively in Barcelona's La Ribera and Grcia districts, which both have a medieval street network with narrow and irregular streets. In these two cases it resulted in an increase of journeys on foot (over 10%) and by bicycle (>15%) and in a higher level of commercial and service activity.[9] The concept is now being applied in different areas of the city, some of them featuring the strictly rectangular grid of Barcelona's Eixample district designed by Ildefons Cerd.[10][11]\\r\\nIn a geoprocessing perspective there are two complementary ways of modeling city blocks:\\r\\nAlways a block without sidewalks is within a block with sidewalks. The geometric subtraction of a block without sidewalks from block with sidewalks, contains the sidewalk, the alley, and any other non-lot sub-structure.\\r\\nA perimeter block is a type of city block which is built up on all sides surrounding a central space that is semi-private. They may contain a mixture of uses, with commercial or retail functions on the ground floor. Perimeter blocks are a key component of many European cities and are an urban form that allows very high urban densities to be achieved without high-rise buildings.[12]\\r\\nOther uses of the term \\"blocks\\".\\r\\nIn North American English and Australian English, the word \\"block\\" is used as an informal unit of distance. For example, someone giving directions might say, \\"It's three blocks from here\\".\\r\\nIn British English the term is very rarely used to express a measure of distance owing to blocks not being used in town or city planning in most countries. However it is often used to describe a short walk around the local area, as in \\"walk around the block\\".\\r\\nThere have been online innovations and websites such as msnbc.com-owned EveryBlock, which uses geo-specific feeds from neighborhood blogs, Flickr, Yelp, Craigslist, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and other aggregated data to give readers a picture of what is going on in their town or neighborhood down to the block.[13]","input":"What does it mean to walk a block?"},{"output":"one to four months","context":"The growth of human hair occurs everywhere on the body except for the soles of the feet, the lips, palms of the hands, some external genital areas, the navel, scar tissue, and, apart from eyelashes, the eyelids.[citation needed] Like skin, hair is a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium made of multi-layered flat cells whose rope-like filaments provide structure and strength to the hair shaft.\\r\\n\\r\\nHair follows a specific growth cycle with three distinct and concurrent phases: anagen, catagen, and telogen. Each phase has specific characteristics that determine the length of the hair. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe body has different types of hair, including vellus hair and androgenic hair, each with its own type of cellular construction.  This varied construction gives the hair unique characteristics, serving specific purposes, mainly warmth (redundant in modern humans) and protection.[citation needed] Most humans develop the longest thickest hair on their scalps and (mostly observed in males) faces. This hair will usually grow to several feet before terminating, but many humans develop much longer hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three stages of hair growth are the anagen, catagen, and telogen phases. Each strand of hair on the human body is at its own stage of development. Once the cycle is complete, it restarts and a new strand of hair begins to form. The rate or speed of hair growth is about 1.25?centimetres or 0.5?inches  per month, or about 15 centimetres  or 6?inches per year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe anagen phase is known as the growth phase. This is the phase where the hair physically grows approximately 1 cm per month.[1] It begins in the papilla and can last from two to six years.[2][3] The span at which the hair remains in this stage of growth is determined by genetics. The longer the hair stays in the anagen phase, the longer it will grow. During this phase, the cells in the papilla divide to produce new hair fibers[contradictory], and the follicle buries itself into the dermal layer of the skin to nourish the strand. About 85% - 90% of the hairs on one's head are in the anagen phase at any given time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe catagen phase, also known as the transitional phase, allows the follicle to, in a sense, renew itself. During this time, which lasts about two weeks, the hair follicle shrinks due to disintegration and the papilla detaches and \\"rests,\\" cutting the hair strand off from its nourishing blood supply. Signals sent out by the body (that only selectively affect 1 percent of all hair of one's body at any given time) determine when the anagen phase ends and the catagen phase begins. The first sign of catagen is the cessation of melanin production in the hair bulb and apoptosis of follicular melanocytes.[4] Ultimately, the follicle is 1/6 its original length, causing the hair shaft to be pushed upward. While hair is not growing during this phase, the length of the terminal fibers increase when the follicle pushes them upward.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the telogen or resting phase (also known as shedding phase) the follicle remains dormant for one to four months. Ten to fifteen percent of the hairs on one's head are in this phase of growth at any given time. In this phase the epidermal cells lining the follicle channel continue to grow as normal and may accumulate around the base of the hair, temporarily anchoring it in place and preserving the hair for its natural purpose without taxing the body's resources needed during the growth phase.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt some point, the follicle will begin to grow again, softening the anchor point of the shaft initially. The hair base will break free from the root and the hair will be shed. Within two weeks the new hair shaft will begin to emerge once the telogen phase is complete. The process results in normal hair loss known as shedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most people, scalp hair growth will halt due to follicle devitalization after reaching a length of generally two or three feet. Exceptions to this rule can be observed in individuals with hair development abnormalities, which may cause an unusual length of hair growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost chemotherapy drugs work by attacking rapidly dividing cells. Rapid cell replication is one of the hallmarks of cancer; however, hair follicle cells also grow and divide quickly. Consequently, the chemotherapy drugs usually inhibit hair growth.  The dose and type of medicine will determine the severity of hair loss. Once the course of chemotherapy has ended, new hair growth may begin after three to 10 weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlopecia is a hair loss disease that can occur in anyone at any stage of life.  Specifically Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that causes hair to spontaneously fall out. It is mainly characterized by bald patches on the scalp or other parts of the body, and can ultimately cause baldness across the entire body. This disease interferes with the hair growth cycle by causing a follicle to prematurely leave the anagen, or active growth, phase and enter the resting, or telogen phase.  The hair growth in the affected follicles is lessened or stopped completely.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraction alopecia is caused by adding too much strain on the hair on one's head.  Tight ponytails and other styles that require added tension to the hair are often what cause this disease.  It can also occur on the face in areas where the hair is often styled. Plucking or waxing one's eyebrows frequently, for example, can yield suppressed hair growth in the area.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the scalp, the hair is usually known to be lost around the hair line, leaving the densest amount of hair at the crown. Small vellus hair will often replace the hair that is lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman hair follicles are very sensitive to the effects of radiation therapy administered to the head, most commonly used to treat cancerous growths within the brain.  Hair shedding may start as soon as two weeks after the first dose of radiation and will continue for a couple of weeks.  Hair follicles typically enter the resting telogen phase and regrowth should commence 2.5 to 3 months after the hair begins to shed.  Regrowth may be sparser after treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nUV levels of either 20 or 50?mJ?cm?2 in the UV-B range have been shown to inhibit hair growth, reduce hair melanin and damage hair follicles.[5]","input":"How long is the telogen phase of hair growth?"},{"output":"Jayamkondar","context":"Kalingatteuparani is a 12th-century Tamil poem and a war song by Jayamkondar, celebrating the victory of Kulottunga Chola I over the Kalinga king, Anantavarman Chodaganga in the Chola-Kalinga war.[1][2] parani is a type of literature thy is written on a king(person) who kills a thousand elephants in a war.

Alfred styled himself King of the Anglo-Saxons and while he was not the first king to lay claim to rule all of the English, his rule represents the first unbroken line of Kings to rule the whole of England, the House of Wessex.[1] The last monarch of a distinct kingdom of England was Anne, who became Queen of Great Britain when England merged with Scotland to form a union in 1707.\\r\\nArguments are made for a few different kings deemed to control enough of the ancient kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxons to be deemed the first King of England. For example, Offa, king of Mercia, and Egbert, king of Wessex, are sometimes described as kings of England by popular writers, but not by all historians.[citation needed] In the late eighth century Offa achieved a dominance over southern England that did not survive his death in 796. In 829 Egbert conquered Mercia, but he soon lost control of it. By the late ninth century Wessex was the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Its king, Alfred the Great, was overlord of western Mercia and used the title King of the Angles and Saxons, but he never ruled eastern and northern England, which was then the Danelaw. His son Edward the Elder conquered the eastern Danelaw, but Edward's son ?thelstan became the first king to rule the whole of England when he conquered Northumbria in 927, and he is regarded by some modern historians as the first king of England.[2][3] The title \\"King of the English\\" or Rex Anglorum in Latin, was first used to describe ?thelstan by one of his charters in 928.\\r\\nThe Principality of Wales was incorporated into the Kingdom of England under the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284, and in 1301 King Edward I invested his eldest son, the future King Edward II, as Prince of Wales. Since that time, except for King Edward III, the eldest sons of all English monarchs have borne this title. After the death of Queen Elizabeth I without issue, in 1603, King James VI of Scotland also became James I of England, joining the crowns of England and Scotland in personal union. By royal proclamation, James styled himself \\"King of Great Britain\\", but no such kingdom was created until 1707, when England and Scotland united to form the new Kingdom of Great Britain during the reign of Queen Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDisputed\\r\\nThere is some evidence that ?lfweard of Wessex may have been king for up to four weeks in 924 (timing itself is unclear, as he died 16 days, not 28 days, after his father), between his father Edward the Elder and his brother ?thelstan, although he was not crowned.[8] However, this is not accepted by all historians. Also, it is unclear whetherif ?lfweard was declared kingit was over the whole kingdom or of Wessex only: one interpretation of the ambiguous evidence is that when Edward died, ?lfweard was declared king in Wessex and ?thelstan in Mercia.[9]\\r\\nEngland came under the control of Sweyn Forkbeard, a Danish king, after an invasion in 1013, during which ?thelred abandoned the throne and went into exile in Normandy.\\r\\nFollowing the death of Sweyn Forkbeard, ?thelred the Unready returned from exile and was again proclaimed king on 3 February 1014. His son succeeded him after being chosen king by the citizens of London and a part of the Witan,[35] despite ongoing Danish efforts in wresting the crown from the West Saxons.\\r\\nFollowing the decisive Battle of Assandun on 18 October 1016, King Edmund signed a treaty with Cnut in which all of England except for Wessex would be controlled by Cnut.[38] Upon Edmund's death on 30 November, Cnut ruled the whole kingdom as its sole king.\\r\\nAfter Harthacnut, there was a brief Saxon Restoration between 1042 and 1066.\\r\\nIn 1066, several rival claimants to the English throne emerged. Among them were Harold Godwinson, elected king by the Witenagemot after the death of Edward the Confessor, as well as Harald Hardrada, King of Norway who claimed to be the rightful heir of Harthacnut, and Duke William II of Normandy, descendant of Rollo, founder of the royal House of Normandy, vassal to the King of France, and first cousin once-removed of Edward the Confessor. Harald and William both invaded separately in 1066. Godwinson successfully repelled the invasion by Hardrada, but ultimately lost the throne of England in the Norman conquest of England. After the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror made permanent the recent removal of the capital from Winchester to London. Following the death of Harold Godwinson on 14 October, the Anglo-Saxon Witenagemot elected as king Edgar the ?theling, the son of Edward the Exile and grandson of Edmund Ironside, but the young monarch was unable to resist the invaders and was never crowned. William was crowned King William I of England on Christmas Day 1066, in Westminster Abbey, and is today known as William the Conqueror, William the Bastard or William I.\\r\\nHenry I left no legitimate male heirs, his son William Adelin having died in the White Ship disaster. This ended the direct Norman line of kings in England. Henry named his eldest daughter, the dowager Empress Matilda as his heir. Before naming Matilda as heir, however, he had been in negotiations to name his nephew Stephen of Blois as his heir. When Henry died, Stephen invaded England, and in a coup d'etat had himself crowned instead of Matilda. The period which followed is known as The Anarchy, as parties supporting each side fought in open warfare on both Britain and on the continent for the better part of two decades.\\r\\nDisputed claimants\\r\\nEmpress Matilda was declared heir presumptive by her father, Henry I, after the death of her brother on the White Ship, and acknowledged as such by the barons. However, upon Henry I's death, the throne was seized by Matilda's cousin, Stephen of Blois. During the ensuing Anarchy, Matilda controlled England for a few months in 1141the first woman so to dobut was never crowned and is rarely listed as a monarch of England.[vii]\\r\\nCount Eustace IV of Boulogne (c. 1130 ÿ 17 August 1153) was appointed co-king of England by his father, King Stephen, on 6 April 1152, in order to guarantee his succession to the throne (as was the custom in France, but not in England). However, the Pope and the Church would not agree to this, and Eustace was not crowned. Eustace died the next year aged 23, during his father's lifetime, and so never became king in his own right.[58]\\r\\nStephen came to an agreement with Matilda in November 1153 with the signing of the Treaty of Wallingford, where Stephen recognised Henry, son of Matilda and her second husband Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, as the designated heir. The royal house descended from Matilda and Geoffrey is widely known by two names, the House of Anjou (after Geoffrey's title as Count of Anjou) or the House of Plantagenet, after his sobriquet. Some historians prefer to group the subsequent kings into two groups, before and after the loss of the bulk of their French possessions, although they are not different royal houses.\\r\\nThe Angevins ruled over the Angevin Empire during the 12th and 13th centuries, an area stretching from the Pyrenees to Ireland. They did not regard England as their primary home until most of their continental domains were lost by John. Though the Angevin dynasty was short-lived, their male line descendants included the House of Plantagenet, the House of Lancaster and the House of York.\\r\\nThe Angevins formulated England's royal coat of arms, which usually showed other kingdoms held or claimed by them or their successors, although without representation of Ireland for quite some time. Dieu et mon droit has generally been used as the motto of English monarchs since being adopted by Edward III,[59] but it was first used as a battle cry by Richard I in 1198 at the Battle of Gisors, when he defeated the forces of Philip II of France, after which, he made it his motto.[59][60]\\r\\nHenry II named his son, another Henry (1155ÿ1183), as co-ruler with him. But this was a Norman custom of designating an heir, and the younger Henry did not outlive his father and rule in his own right, so he is not counted as a monarch on lists of kings.\\r\\nDisputed claimant\\r\\nLouis VIII of France briefly ruled about half of England from 1216 to 1217 at the conclusion of the First Barons' War against King John. On marching into London he was openly received by the rebel barons and citizens of London and proclaimed (though not crowned) king at St Paul's cathedral. Many nobles, including Alexander II of Scotland for his English possessions, gathered to give homage to him. However, in signing the Treaty of Lambeth in 1217, Louis conceded that he had never been the legitimate king of England.\\r\\nThe House of Plantagenet takes its name from Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, husband of the Empress Matilda and father of Henry II. The name Plantagenet itself was unknown as a family name per se until Richard of York adopted it as his family name in the 15th century. It has since been retroactively applied to English monarchs from Henry II onward. It is common among modern historians to refer to Henry II and his sons as the \\"Angevins\\" due to their vast continental Empire, and most of the Angevin kings before John spent more time in their continental possessions than in England. It is from the time of Henry III, after the loss of most of the family's continental possessions, that the Plantagenet kings became more English in nature. The Houses of Lancaster and York are cadet branches of the House of Plantagenet.\\r\\n\\r\\n[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis house descended from Edward III's third surviving son, John of Gaunt. Henry IV seized power from Richard II (and also displaced the next in line to the throne, Edmund Mortimer (then aged 7), a descendant of Edward III's second son, Lionel of Antwerp).\\r\\nThe House of York inherited its name from the fourth surviving son of Edward III, Edmund, 1st Duke of York, but claimed the right to the throne through Edward III's second surviving son, Lionel of Antwerp.\\r\\nThe Wars of the Roses (1455ÿ1485) saw the throne pass back and forth between the rival houses of Lancaster and York.\\r\\nThe Tudors descended from John Beaufort, one of the illegitimate children of John of Gaunt (third surviving son of Edward III), by Gaunt's long-term mistress Katherine Swynford. Those descended from English monarchs only through an illegitimate child would normally have no claim on the throne, but the situation was complicated when Gaunt and Swynford eventually married in 1396 (25 years after John Beaufort's birth). In view of the marriage, the church retroactively declared the Beauforts legitimate via a papal bull the same year (also enshrined in an Act of Parliament in 1397). A subsequent proclamation by John of Gaunt's legitimate son, King Henry IV, also recognised the Beauforts' legitimacy, but declared them ineligible ever to inherit the throne. Nevertheless, the Beauforts remained closely allied with Gaunt's other descendants, the Royal House of Lancaster.\\r\\nJohn Beaufort's granddaughter Lady Margaret Beaufort was married to Edmund Tudor. Tudor was the son of Welsh courtier Owain Tudur (anglicised to Owen Tudor) and Catherine of Valois, the widow of the Lancastrian King Henry V. Edmund Tudor and his siblings were either illegitimate, or the product of a secret marriage, and owed their fortunes to the goodwill of their legitimate half-brother King Henry VI. When the House of Lancaster fell from power, the Tudors followed. By the late 15th century, the Tudors were the last hope for the Lancaster supporters. Edmund Tudor's son became king as Henry VII after defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, ending the Wars of the Roses. King Henry married Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV, thereby uniting the Lancastrian and York lineages.\\r\\nWith Henry VIII's break from the Roman Catholic Church, the monarch became the Supreme Head of the Church of England and of the Church of Ireland. Elizabeth I's title became the Supreme Governor of the Church of England.\\r\\nDisputed claimant\\r\\nEdward VI named Lady Jane Grey as his heir in his will, overruling the order of succession laid down by Parliament in the Third Succession Act. Four days after his death on 6 July 1553, Jane was proclaimed queenthe first of three Tudor women to be proclaimed queen regnant. Nine days after the proclamation, on 19 July, the Privy Council switched allegiance and proclaimed Edward VI's Catholic half-sister Mary queen. Jane was executed for treason in 1554, aged 16.\\r\\nUnder the terms of the marriage treaty between Philip I of Naples (Philip II of Spain from 15 January 1556) and Queen Mary I, Philip was to enjoy Mary's titles and honours for as long as their marriage should last. All official documents, including Acts of Parliament, were to be dated with both their names, and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple. An Act of Parliament gave him the title of king and stated that he \\"shall aid her Highness? in the happy administration of her Grace's realms and dominions\\"[93] (although elsewhere the Act stated that Mary was to be \\"sole queen\\"). Nonetheless, Philip was to co-reign with his wife.[94] As the new King of England could not read English, it was ordered that a note of all matters of state should be made in Latin or Spanish.[94][95][96] Coins were minted showing the heads of both Mary and Philip, and the coat of arms of England (pictured right) was impaled with Philip's to denote their joint reign.[97][98] Acts which made it high treason to deny Philip's royal authority were passed in England (see Treason Act 1554) and Ireland.[99] In 1555, Pope Paul IV issued a papal bull recognising Philip and Mary as rightful King and Queen of Ireland.\\r\\nFollowing the death of Elizabeth I in 1603 without issue, her first cousin twice removed, King James VI of Scotland, succeeded to the English throne as James I in the Union of the Crowns. James was descended from the Tudors through his great-grandmother, Margaret Tudor, the eldest daughter of Henry VII. In 1604, he adopted the title King of Great Britain. However, the two parliaments remained separate until the Acts of Union 1707.[101]\\r\\nNo monarch reigned between the execution of Charles I in 1649 and the Restoration of Charles II in 1660. Between 1649 and 1653, there was no single English head of state, as England was ruled directly by the Rump Parliament with the English Council of State acting as executive power during a period known as the Commonwealth of England. After a coup d'etat in 1653, Oliver Cromwell forcibly took control of England from Parliament. He dissolved the Rump Parliament at the head of a military force and England entered a period known as The Protectorate, under the direct control of a single individual known as the Lord Protector. While not officially monarchs, the holder of the office of Lord passed from Oliver Cromwell to his son Richard. Richard lacked both the ability to rule and confidence of the Army, and he was forcibly removed by the English Committee of Safety under the leadership of Charles Fleetwood in May 1659. England again lacked any single head of state during several months of conflict between Fleetwood's party and that of George Monck. Monck took control of the country in December 1659, and after almost a year of anarchy, the monarchy was formally restored when Charles II returned from France to accept the throne of England following the Declaration of Breda and an invitation to reclaim the throne from the Convention Parliament of 1660.\\r\\nAfter the Monarchy was restored, England came under the rule of Charles II, whose reign was relatively peaceful domestically, given the tumultuous time of the Interregnum years. Tensions still existed between Catholics and Protestants, however, and with the ascension of Charles's brother, the openly Catholic James II, England was again sent into a period of political turmoil. James II was ousted by Parliament less than three years after ascending to the throne, replaced by his daughter Mary II and her husband (also his nephew) William III during the Glorious Revolution. While James and his descendants would continue to claim the throne, all Catholics (such as James and his son Charles) were barred from the throne by the Act of Settlement 1701, enacted by Anne, another of James's Protestant daughters. After the Acts of Union 1707, England as a sovereign state ceased to exist, replaced by the new Kingdom of Great Britain.\\r\\nThe Acts of Union 1707 were a pair of Parliamentary Acts passed during 1706 and 1707 by the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland to put into effect the Treaty of Union agreed on 22 July 1706. The Acts joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland (previously separate sovereign states, with separate legislatures but with the same monarch) into the Kingdom of Great Britain.[116]\\r\\nEngland, Scotland, and Ireland had shared a monarch for more than a hundred years, since the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when King James VI of Scotland inherited the English and Irish thrones from his first cousin twice removed, Queen Elizabeth I. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head. There had been attempts in 1606, 1667, and 1689, to unite England and Scotland by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early eighteenth century that the idea had the support of both political establishments behind it, albeit for rather different reasons.\\r\\nThe standard title for all monarchs from ?thelstan until the time of King John was Rex Anglorum (\\"King of the English\\"). In addition, many of the pre-Norman kings assumed extra titles, as follows:\\r\\nIn the Norman period Rex Anglorum remained standard, with occasional use of Rex Anglie (\\"King of England\\"). The Empress Matilda styled herself Domina Anglorum (\\"Lady of the English\\").\\r\\nFrom the time of King John onwards all other titles were eschewed in favour of Rex or Regina Anglie.\\r\\nIn 1604 James I, who had inherited the English throne the previous year, adopted the title (now usually rendered in English rather than Latin) King of Great Britain. The English and Scottish parliaments, however, did not recognise this title until the Acts of Union of 1707 under Queen Anne (who was Queen of Great Britain rather than king).[xvi]\\r\\nCoronations","input":"Who was the first female monarch of england?"},{"output":"legislation or directives of the higher level of government","context":"A local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question of municipal autonomy is a key question of public administration and governance. The institutions of local government vary greatly between countries, and even where similar arrangements exist, the terminology often varies. Common names for local government entities include state, province, region, department, county, prefecture, district, city, township, town, borough, parish, municipality, shire, village, and local service district.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal government traditionally had limited power in Egypt's highly centralized state. Under the central government were twenty-six governorates (sing., muhafazah; pl., muhafazat). These were subdivided into districts (sing., markaz; pl., marakaz) and villages (sing., qaryah; pl., qura) or towns. At each level, there was a governing structure that combined representative councils and government-appointed executive organs headed by governors, district officers, and mayors, respectively. Governors were appointed by the president, and they, in turn, appointed subordinate executive officers. The coercive backbone of the state apparatus ran downward from the Ministry of Interior through the governors' executive organs to the district police station and the village headman (sing., umdah; pl., umadah).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the revolution, state penetration of the rural areas was limited by the power of local notables, but under Nasser, land reform reduced their socioeconomic dominance, and the incorporation of peasants into cooperatives transferred mass dependence from landlords to government. The extension of officials into the countryside permitted the regime to bring development and services to the village. The local branches of the ruling party, the Arab Socialist Union (ASU), fostered a certain peasant political activism and coopted the local notablesin particular the village headmenand checked their independence from the regime.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nState penetration did not retreat under Sadat and Mubarak. The earlier effort to mobilize peasants and deliver services disappeared as the local party and cooperative withered, but administrative controls over the peasants remained intact. The local power of the old families and the headmen revived but more at the expense of peasants than of the state. The district police station balanced the notables, and the system of local government (the mayor and council) integrated them into the regime.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSadat took several measures to decentralize power to the provinces and towns. Governors acquired more authority under Law Number 43 of 1979, which reduced the administrative and budgetary controls of the central government over the provinces. The elected councils acquired, at least formally, the right to approve or disapprove the local budget. In an effort to reduce local demands on the central treasury, local government was given wider powers to raise local taxes. But local representative councils became vehicles of pressure for government spending, and the soaring deficits of local government bodies had to be covered by the central government. Local government was encouraged to enter into joint ventures with private investors, and these ventures stimulated an alliance between government officials and the local rich that paralleled the infitah alliance at the national level. Under Mubarak decentralization and local autonomy became more of a reality, and local policies often reflected special local conditions. Thus, officials in Upper Egypt often bowed to the powerful Islamic movement there, while those in the port cities struck alliances with importers.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, Mali has undertaken an ambitious decentralization program, which involves the capital district of Bamako, seven regions subdivided into 46 cercles, and 682 rural community districts (communes). The state retains an advisory role in administrative and fiscal matters, and it provides technical support, coordination, and legal recourse to these levels. Opportunities for direct political participation, and increased local responsibility for development have been improved.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn AugustÿSeptember 1998, elections were held for urban council members, who subsequently elected their mayors. In May/June 1999, citizens of the communes elected their communal council members for the first time. Female voter turnout was about 70% of the total, and observers considered the process open and transparent. With mayors, councils, and boards in place at the local level, newly elected officials, civil society organizations, decentralized technical services, private sector interests, other communes, and donor groups began partnering to further development.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually, the cercles will be reinstituted (formerly grouping arrondissements) with a legal and financial basis of their own. Their councils will be chosen by and from members of the communal councils. The regions, at the highest decentralized level, will have a similar legal and financial autonomy, and will comprise a number of cercles within their geographical boundaries. Mali needs to build capacity at these levels, especially to mobilize and manage financial resources.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Africa has a two tiered local government system comprising local municipalities which fall into district municipalities, and metropolitan municipalities which span both tiers of local government.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfghanistan was traditionally divided into provinces governed by centrally appointed governors with considerable autonomy in local affairs. There are currently 34 provinces. During the Soviet occupation and the development of country-wide resistance, local areas came increasingly under the control of mujaheddin groups that were largely independent of any higher authority; local commanders, in some instances, asserted a measure of independence also from the mujaheddin leadership in Pakistan, establishing their own systems of local government, collecting revenues, running educational and other facilities, and even engaging in local negotiations. Mujaheddin groups retained links with the Peshawar parties to ensure access to weapons that were doled out to the parties by the government of Pakistan for distribution to fighters inside Afghanistan.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Taliban set up a shura (assembly), made up of senior Taliban members and important tribal  from the area. Each shura made laws and collected taxes locally. The Taliban set up a provisional government for the whole of Afghanistan, but it did not exercise central control over the local shuras.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe process of setting up the transitional government in June 2002 by the Loya Jirga took many steps involving local government. First, at the district and municipal level, traditional shura councils met to pick electorspersons who cast ballots for Loya Jirga delegates. Each district or municipality had to choose a predetermined number of electors, based on the size of its population. The electors then traveled to regional centers and cast ballots, to choose from amongst themselves a smaller number of loya jirga delegates according to allotted numbers assigned to each district. The delegates then took part in the Loya Jirga.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe warlords who rule various regions of the country exert local control. The transitional government is attempting to integrate local governing authorities with the central government, but it lacks the loyalty from the warlords necessary to its governing authority. More traditional elements of political authoritysuch as Sufi networks, royal lineage, clan strength, age-based wisdom, and the likestill exist and play a role in Afghan society. Karzai is relying on these traditional sources of authority in his challenge to the warlords and older Islamist leaders. The deep ethnic, linguistic, sectarian, tribal, racial, and regional cleavages present in the country create what is called \\"Qawm\\" identity, emphasizing the local over higher-order formations. Qawm refers to the group to which the individual considers himself to belong, whether a subtribe, village, valley, or neighborhood. Local governing authority relies upon these forms of identity and loyalty.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions,[1] each named after their respective divisional headquarters: Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Rangpur and Mymensingh Division.\\r\\n\\r\\nDivisions are subdivided into districts (zila).

The districts lost most of their importance in 1999 in an administrative reform; they remain as territorial divisions and seats of various branches of state administration.[10] A further reform in effect since January 2003 created 204 Municipalities with Extended Competence (obce s roz??enou p?sobnost); also obce III. stupn ÿ third-level municipalities, unofficially also called \\"little districts\\" (Czech: 'mal okresy') which took over most of the administration of the former district authorities. Some of these are further divided between Municipalities with Commissioned Local Authority (obce s pov?enym obecnm ~?adem, shortened to pov?en obec, pl. pov?en obce; \\"second-level municipalities\\").  In 2007 the borders of the districts were slightly adjusted and 119 municipalities are now within different districts.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor local government purposes, Denmark is divided into five regions (Danish: regioner), with their most important area of responsibility being the public health service. They are also responsible for employment policies, and some regions are responsible for public mass transit. Regions are not entitled to levy their own taxes, and they rely entirely on central state funding (around 70%) and funding coming from the municipalities (around 30%). Regions are led by directly elected councils (regionsr?d). They consist of 41 members each.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe regions are further divided into 98 municipalities (kommuner). Elections for the municipalities are held on the third Tuesday of November every four years.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia is divided into fifteen counties (Estonian: maakonnad), each led by a county governor (maavanem), who represents the national government at the regional level. Governors are appointed by the government, and so the regions do not have full self-government. The regions are further divided into 227 municipalities (omavalitsus), and each municipality is a unit of self-government with its representative and executive bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most important administrative layer of local government in Finland are the 311 municipalities, which may also call themselves towns or cities. They account for half of public spending. Spending is financed by municipal income tax, property tax, state subsidies, and other revenue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to municipalities, there are two intermediate levels of local government. Municipalities co-operate in seventy-four sub-regions and nineteen regions. These are governed by the member municipalities and have only limited powers. However, the autonomous province of ?land has a directly elected regional council, and the Sami people have a semi-autonomous Sami Domicile Area in Lapland for issues on language and culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to its Constitution of 1958, France has 3 levels of local government:\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in addition to the constitutional clauses of 1958, there now exist specificities:\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1 January 2011, Greece consists of thirteen regions subdivided into a total of 325 municipalities and communities. The regions have their own elected governors and regional councils, however there are seven decentralized administrations, which group from one to three regions under a government-appointed general secretary. There is also one autonomous area, Mount Athos.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor local government, Hungary is divided into 19 counties. In addition, the capital (f?vros), Budapest, is independent of any county government\\r\\n\\r\\nThe counties are further subdivided into 174 subregions (kistrsgek), and Budapest is its own subregion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also 23 towns with county rights (singular megyei jog~ vros). The local authorities of these towns have extended powers, but these towns belong to the territory of the respective county instead of being independent territorial units.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Municipalities of Iceland are local administrative areas in Iceland that provide a number of services to their inhabitants such as kindergartens, elementary schools, waste management, social services, public housing, public transportation, services to senior citizens and handicapped people. They also govern zoning and can voluntarily take on additional functions if they have the budget for it. The autonomy of municipalities over their own matters is guaranteed by the constitution of Iceland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe municipalities are governed by municipal councils which are directly elected every four years. The sizes of these councils vary from five members in the smallest municipalities to fifteen in the largest one. Most municipalities except for the very small ones hire an executive manager who may or may not be a member of the municipal council. These managers are usually referred to as mayors (b?jarstj܇ri / borgarstj܇ri) in the mostly urban municipalities but \\"commune manager\\" (sveitarstj܇ri) in the rural or mixed municipalities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIreland is mainly based on a structure of thirty-one local authorities, termed County, City or City and County Councils. By far, the main source of funding is national government. Other sources include rates on commercial and industrial property, council housing rents, service charges and borrowing. Local policy decisions are sometimes heavily influenced by the TDs who represent the local constituency in Dil ireann (the main chamber of parliament in Ireland), and may be dictated by national politics rather than local needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal government on the Isle of Man is based on the concept of ancient parishes. There are three types of local authorities: a borough corporation, town commissions, and parish commissions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian Constitution defines three levels of local government:\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor cities also have an extra tier of local government named Circoscrizione di Decentramento Comunale or, in some cities (e.g. Rome) Municipio.\\r\\n\\r\\nLatvia is a unitary state, currently divided into 110 municipalities (Latvian: novadi) and 9 republican cities (Latvian: republikas pilstas) with their own council.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiechtenstein is divided into eleven municipalities (Gemeinden?ÿ  singular Gemeinde), most consisting of only a single town.\\r\\n\\r\\nLithuania has a three-tier division of local government: the country is divided into 10 counties (Lithuanian: singular ÿ apskritis, plural ÿ apskritys) that are further subdivided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: singular ÿ savivaldyb?, plural ÿ savivaldyb?s) which consist of over 500 elderships (Lithuanian: singular ÿ seninija, plural ÿ seninijos).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe counties are ruled by county governors (Lithuanian: apskrities vir?ininkas) appointed by the central government, and effectively oversee the two lower tiers of local government.\\r\\n\\r\\nMunicipalities are the most important administrative unit of local government. Each municipality has its own government and council, with elections taking place every four years. The council elects the mayor and appoints elders to govern the elderships.\\r\\n\\r\\nElderships, numbering over 500, are the smallest units of local government. They provide public services such as registering births and deaths and identifying individuals or families in need of welfare.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalta is a unitary city state divided into 68 municipalities (local councils), according to the constitution of the Malta.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Netherlands has three tiers of government. There are two levels of local government in the Netherlands, the provinces and the municipalities. The water boards are also part of the local government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Netherlands is divided into twelve provinces (provincie, pl. provincies). They form the tier of administration between the central government and the municipalities. Each province is governed by a provincial council, the States-Provincial (Provinciale Staten, abbr. to PS). Its members are elected every four years. The day-to-day management of the province is in the hands of the provincial executive, the States Deputed (Gedeputeerde Staten, abbr. to GS). Members of the executive are chosen by the provincial council from among its own members and like the members of the provincial council serve for a period of four years. Members elected to the executive have to give up their membership of the provincial council. The size of the executive varies from one province to another. In Flevoland, the smallest of the Dutch provinces, it has four members, while most other provinces have six or seven. Meetings of the provincial executive are chaired by the King's Commissioner (Commissaris van de Koning(in), abbr. to CvdK). The King's Commissioner is not elected by the residents of the province, but appointed by the Crown (the King and government ministers). The appointment is for six years and may be extended by a second term. The King's Commissioner can be dismissed only by the Crown. King's Commissioners play an important part in the appointment of municipal mayors. When a vacancy arises, the King's Commissioner first asks the municipal council for its views as to a successor, then writes to the Minister of the Interior recommending a candidate.\\r\\n\\r\\nMunicipalities (gemeente, pl. gemeenten) form the lowest tier of government in the Netherlands, after the central government and the provinces. There are 415 of them (1 January 2012). The municipal council (gemeenteraad) is the highest authority in the municipality. Its members are elected every four years. The role of the municipal council is comparable to that of the board of an organisation or institution. Its main job is to decide the municipality's broad policies and to oversee their implementation. The day-to-day administration of the municipality is in the hands of the municipal executive (college van burgemeester en wethouders, abbr. to (college van) B&W), made up of the mayor (burgemeester) and the aldermen (wethouder, pl. wethouders). The executive implements national legislation on matters such as social assistance, unemployment benefits and environmental management. It also bears primary responsibility for the financial affairs of the municipality and for its personnel policies. Aldermen are appointed by the council. Councillors can be chosen to act as aldermen. In that case, they lose their seats on the council and their places are taken by other representatives of the same political parties. Non-councillors can also be appointed. Unlike councillors and aldermen, mayors are not elected (not even indirectly), but are appointed by the Crown. Mayors chair both the municipal council and the executive. They have a number of statutory powers and responsibilities of their own. They are responsible for maintaining public order and safety within the municipality and frequently manage the municipality's public relations. As Crown appointees, mayors also have some responsibility for overseeing the work of the municipality, its policies and relations with other government bodies. Although they are obliged to carry out the decisions of the municipal council and executive, they may recommend that the Minister of the Interior quash any decision that they believe to be contrary to the law or against the public interest. Mayors are invariably appointed for a period of six years and are normally re-appointed automatically for another term, provided the municipal council agrees. They can be dismissed only by the Crown and not by the municipal council.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater boards (waterschap and hoogheemraadschap, pl. waterschappen and hoogheemraadschappen) are among the oldest government authorities in the Netherlands. They literally form the foundation of the whole Dutch system of local government; from time immemorial they have shouldered the responsibility for water management for the residents of their area. In polders this mainly involves regulating the water level. It has always been in the common interest to keep water out and polder residents have always had to work together. That is what led to the creation of water boards. The structure of the water boards varies, but they all have a general administrative body and an executive board (college van dijkgraaf en heemraden) consisting of a chairperson (dijkgraaf) and other members ((hoog)heemraad, pl. (hoog)heemraden). The chairperson also presides the general administrative body. This body consists of people representing the various categories of stakeholders: landholders, leaseholders, owners of buildings, companies and, since recently, all the residents as well. Importance and financial contribution decide how many representatives each category may delegate. Certain stakeholders (e.g. environmental organisations) may be given the power to appoint members. The general administrative body elects the executive board from among its members. The government appoints the chairperson for a period of six years. The general administrative body is elected for a period of four years. In the past the administrative body was elected as individuals but from 2009 they will be elected as party representatives. Unlike municipal council elections, voters do not usually have to go to a polling station but can vote by mail.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorway's regional administration is organised in 19 counties (fylke), with 18 of them subdivided into 431 municipalities (kommune) per 1 January 2006. The municipal sector is a provider of vital services to the Norwegian public, accounting for about 20% of Norwegian GNP and 24% of total employment. Norway had 435 municipalities of varying size in 2003, each administered by an elected municipal council. They are grouped into 19 counties (fylker), each governed by an elected county council. Each county is headed by a governor appointed by the king in council. Oslo is the only urban center that alone constitutes a county; the remaining 18 counties consist of both urban and rural areas. County and municipal councils are popularly elected every four years. The municipalities have wide powers over the local economy, with the state exercising strict supervision. They have the right to tax and to use their resources to support education, libraries, social security, and public works such as streetcar lines, gas and electricity works, roads, and town planning, but they are usually aided in these activities by state funds.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, mainland Portugal is divided into 18 districts (in Portuguese, distritos). Each district takes the name of their respective capital city.  Insular Portugal, comprising the two Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira, is organized as two autonomous regions (in Portuguese, regi?es aut܇nomas).\\r\\n\\r\\nEach district and each Autonomous region is divided into municipalities (in Portuguese, municpios) which, in turn, are subdivided into parishes (in Portuguese, freguesias).\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1976, when the two Autonomous regions of Portugal were established, the Azores and Madeira are no longer divided into districts.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoland has three levels of subdivision. The territory of Poland is divided into 16 voivodeships (provinces); these are further divided into 379 powiats (counties or districts), and these in turn are divided into 2,479 gminas (communes or municipalities). Major cities normally have the status of both gmina and powiat.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach voivodeship is governed by a Voivode appointed by prime minister of Poland and the respective regional assembly called a sejmik. \\r\\n\\r\\nSpain is divided into 17 autonomous communities, which in turn are divided into 50 provinces. There are also two autonomous cities: those of Ceuta and Melilla. Finally, each province comprises a number of municipalities.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach administrative entity is given powers, structure, and boundaries by a law that was passed by the Prime Minister .\\r\\n\\r\\nLaw 7/1985,[11] passed by the former Spanish President Felipe Gonzlez Mrquez (socialist), lays down the procedure of the Local Government. Every city in Spain used this Law until 2003. This year, the former Spanish President Jos Mara Aznar L܇pez (conservative), passed a Law (57/2003)[12] to modernize organic rules of those cities which had more than 250,000 inhabitants, and other important cities (like capital cities of provinces with at least 175,000 inhabitants). Also, it exists two other important Laws for specifically Madrid (Law 22/2006)[13] and Barcelona (Law 1/2006).[14] The main governing body in most municipalities is called Ayuntamiento (in the less populated municipalities an alternative local organization system called open council, \\"concejo abierto\\", is used). The Ayuntamiento in turn is formed by the Plenary (el Pleno, the collective formed by the city councillors) and the Mayor. The number of members that compose The Plenary varies depending on city's population (for example, since 2007 Valencia has 33 members and Pamplona has 27). The name given to the members of the Plenary is councillor (concejal). Those councillors are elected between city's inhabitants every four years by direct vote. After being elected, councillors meet in a special Plenary session to determine who will be elected, between them, as city's Mayor. In the next days after the election, the mayor chooses some councillors to set up the executive governing body (Junta de Gobierno or Comisi܇n de Gobierno). After that, and for the next four years, city's mayor and the Junta de Gobierno will govern over the city according to their competences (urbanism, some taxes, local police, licenses for specific activities, cleaning services, etc.). Meanwhile, councillors in the Plenary but not part of the Junta de Gobierno (the opposition) will oversee Mayor's rule.\\r\\nThe autonomous community of Catalonia is divided in 4 provinces and more than 900 municipalities. Between these two tiers, there are 41 comarques (singular, comarca), roughly equivalent to 'district' or 'county'. The comarca is a commonwealth, or union, of municipalities with competences in several fields (Law 6/1987 of the Parliament of Catalonia).\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery fourth year general elections are held in Sweden to elect members of the national parliament, 20 county council assemblies and 290 municipal assemblies. As the parliament elects the national government, the local assemblies elect their executive committees and their boards. Members in local committees and boards are elected proportionally by the political parties in the assemblies, giving all the major parties representation. The parties usually cooperate well on the local levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe county councils (landsting) are responsible for health care and usually provide transportation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe municipalities (kommuner) are responsible for:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a voluntary basis, the municipalities provide sports, culture, housing, energy as well as commercial service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe activities are financed by income taxes. Swedes pay around 20% of their taxable income to the municipality and around 11% to the county council. (The national government is financed by VAT and payroll taxes and fees.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe system of local government is different in each of the four home nations of the United Kingdom. In total there are 426 local authorities in the UK. 346 of these are in England, 26 in Northern Ireland, 32 in Scotland and 22 are in Wales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most complex system is in England, the result of numerous reforms and reorganisation over the centuries.\\r\\nThe top level of sub-national administration within England until the end of March 2012 consists of the nine regions.  The regions were used by central government for various statistical purposes, and Government Offices and assorted other institutions including Regional Development Agencies. Regional Government Offices, Regional Development Agencies and Regional Ministers were all abolished by the Cameron ministry in 2010. Only the London region which is a sub-region compared to the other regions of England has a directly elected government.  Only one regional referendum has been held to date to seek consent for the introduction of direct elections elsewhere  in the northeast of England  and this was overwhelmingly rejected by the electorate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe layers of elected local government vary.  In different areas the highest tier of elected local government may be:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most areas there is a lower tier of government, civil parish, with limited functions.  Most civil parishes are in rural areas, but if the parish is a town the parish council may be called a town council.  In a few cases the parish is a city, and the parish council is called a city council.\\r\\n\\r\\nMetropolitan counties, and a few non-metropolitan counties, no longer have elected councils or administrative functions, and their former functions are performed by districts.  Such counties remain ceremonial counties.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1 April 2015 Northern Ireland is divided into 11 districts. Local government in Northern Ireland does not carry out the same range of functions as those in the rest of the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal government in Scotland is arranged on the lines of unitary authorities, with the nation divided into 32 council areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nWales has a uniform system of 22 unitary authorities, variously styled as county, county borough, city or city and county local authorities. There are also communities, equivalent to parishes.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada has a federal system with three orders of government. The largest is the federal government, followed by the provincial and local governments.[15] Municipal governments are separately elected. They must follow laws and guidelines as set out by their province, but are allowed to pass additional by-laws and acts unique to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMexico is a Federal Republic made up by 31 states and a federal district. Each state is divided in municipios, while the federal district is divided in sixteen delegaciones. Twenty-nine states of Mexico were created as administrative divisions by the constitution of 1917, which grants them those powers not expressly vested in the federal government; Mexico's two remaining territories, Baja California Sur and Quintana Roo, achieved statehood on 9 October 1974, raising the total to 31. Each state has a constitution, a governor elected for six years, and a unicameral legislature, with representatives elected by district vote in proportion to population. An ordinary session of the legislature is held annually, and extraordinary sessions may be called by the governor or the permanent committee. Bills may be introduced by legislators, by the governor, by the state supreme court, and by municipalities (a unit comparable to a US county). In addition to the 31 states, there is also one federal district comprising Mexico City, whose governor serves as a member of the cabinet. Many state services are supported by federal subsidies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal unit of state government is the municipality. Mexico's 2,378 municipalities are governed by municipal presidents and municipal councils. State governors generally select the nominees for the municipal elections. Municipal budgets are approved by the respective state governors. Until 1997, the president appointed the mayor of Mexico City. Political reforms allowed the first open elections in 1997, and Cuauhtmoc Cardenas Sol܇rzano became Mexico City's first elected mayor.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal government in the United States refers to governmental jurisdictions below the level of the state. Most states have at least two tiers of local government: counties and municipalities. In some states, counties are divided into townships. There are several different types of jurisdictions at the municipal level, including the city, town, parish, borough, village, reservations and boundaries.  The types and nature of these municipal entities varies from state to state.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal government is the third type of government in Australia, after Federal and State.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Zealand has a local government system comprising two complementary sets of local authoritiesregional councils and territorial authorities. There are 78 local authorities consisting of:\\r\\n\\r\\nSix of the territorial authorities are unitary authorities, which also have the powers of a regional council. They are Auckland Council, Nelson City Council, the Gisborne, Marlborough and Tasman district councils, and Chatham Islands Council.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegional council areas are based on water catchment areas, whereas territorial authorities are based on community of interest and road access. Within a regional council area there are usually many city or district councils, although city and district councils can be in multiple regional council areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nArgentina is a federation of 23 provinces and the federal capital of Buenos Aires. During the 19th century there was a bitter struggle between Buenos Aires and the interior provinces, and there has long been an element of tension regarding the division of powers between the central government and provincial bodies. The federal government retains control over such matters as the regulation of commerce, customs collections, currency, civil or commercial codes, or the appointment of foreign agents. The provincial governors are elected every four years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe constitutional \\"national intervention\\" and \\"state of siege\\" powers of the president have been invoked frequently. The first of these powers was designed to \\"guarantee the republican form of government in the provinces.\\" Since the adoption of the 1853 constitution, the federal government has intervened over 200 times, mostly by presidential decree. Under this authority, provincial and municipal offices may be declared vacant, appointments annulled, and local elections supervised. Between 1966 and 1973, all local legislatures were dissolved and provincial governors were appointed by the new president. A restoration of provincial and municipal government followed the return to constitutional government in 1973. After the March 1976 coup, the federal government again intervened to remove all provincial governors and impose direct military rule over all municipalities. Since 1983, representative local government has been in force again.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 1996, the President appointed the mayor of Buenos Aires, and by law, the president and Congress controlled any legislation that affected the city. Constitutional reforms that year led to an elected mayoral position, and a 60-member Poder Legislativo (legislative power).\\r\\n\\r\\nBrazil is divided into 26 states and a federal district, the government is divided into federal, state, and municipalities. The federal district has no municipalities and acts as a state and municipality at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no minimum or maximum population requirement for municipalities. Bor is the smallest municipality of the country with 805 inhabitants, S?o Paulo is the largest with 11,316,149 inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nElections in federal, state and municipalities follow all the same system, with elections of president, governor and mayor for executive branch and federal deputy, federal senate, state deputy and alderman for legislative branch. In municipalities according to the constitution, the number of alderman varies from 9 to 55 aldermans.\\r\\n\\r\\nParaguay is divided into 17 departments, which are subdivided into districts, which, in turn, comprise municipalities (the minimum requirement for a municipality is 3,000 persons) and rural districts (partidos). A governor, elected by popular vote, runs each department. Municipal government is exercised through a municipal board, chosen by direct election, and an executive department. In the principal cities and capitals, the executive department is headed by a mayor appointed by the minister of the interior; in other localities, the mayor is appointed by the presidents of the municipal boards.Police chiefs are appointed by the central government.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeru is divided into 25 regions and the province of Lima. Each region has an elected government composed of a president and council that serve four-year terms.[16] These governments plan regional development, execute public investment projects, promote economic activities, and manage public property.[17]  The province of Lima is administered by a city council.[18] The goal of devolving power to regional and municipal governments was among others to improve popular participation. NGOs played an important role in the decentralisation process and still influence local politics.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nUruguay's administrative subdivisions consisted of nineteen territories called departments and governed by intendencias, which were subordinate to the central government and responsible for local administration. They enforced national laws and administered the nation's social and educational policies and institutions within their territories. These territories had limited taxing powers, but they could borrow funds and acquire property. They also had the power to establish unpaid five-member local boards or town councils in municipalities other than the departmental capital if the population was large enough to warrant such a body.\\r\\n\\r\\nExecutive authority was vested in a governor (intendente), who administered the department, and in a thirty-one-member departmental board (junta departmental), which carried out legislative functions. These functions included approval of the departmental budget and judicial actions, such as impeachment proceedings against departmental officials, including the governor. At the municipal level, a mayor (intendente municipal) assumed executive and administrative duties, carrying out resolutions made by the local board (whose members were appointed on the basis of proportional representation of the political parties). The governor was required to comply with and enforce the constitution and the laws and to promulgate the decrees enacted by the departmental board. The governor was authorized to prepare the budget, submit it for approval to the departmental board, appoint the board's employees, and, if necessary, discipline or suspend them. The governor represented the department in its relations with the national government and other departmental governments and in the negotiation of contracts with public or private agencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the governor, the members of the departmental board and the mayor were elected for five-year terms in direct, popular elections. A governor could be reelected only once, and candidates for the post had to meet the same requirements as those for a senator, in addition to being a native of the department or a resident therein for at least three years before assuming office. Departmental board members had to be at least twenty-three years of age, native born (or a legal citizen for at least three years), and a native of the department (or a resident for at least three years).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe board sat in the capital city of each department and exercised jurisdiction throughout the entire territory of the department. It could issue decrees and resolutions that it deemed necessary either on the suggestion of the governor or on its own initiative. It could approve budgets, fix the amount of taxes, request the intervention of the Accounts Tribunal for advice concerning departmental finances or administration, and remove from officeat the request of the governormembers of nonelective local departmental boards. The board also supervised local public services; public health; and primary, secondary, preparatory, industrial, and artistic education. Although Montevideo was the smallest department in terms of area (divided into twenty-three geographic zones that generally coincided with the electoral zones), its departmental board had sixty-five members in 1990; all other departments had thirty-one-member boards and a five-member executive council appointed by the departmental board, with proportional representation from the principal political parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nData as of December 1990[citation needed]","input":"What is the source of local governments authority?"},{"output":"1960s","context":"The Western is a genre of various arts which tell stories set primarily in the later half of the 19th century in the American Old West, often centering on the life of a nomadic cowboy or gunfighter[1] armed with a revolver and a rifle who rides a horse. Cowboys and gunslingers typically wear Stetson hats, bandannas, spurs, cowboy boots and buckskins. Recurrring characters include the aforementioned cowboys, Native Americans, bandits, lawmen, bounty hunters, outlaws, soldiers (especially mounted cavalry, such as buffalo soldiers), and settlers (farmers, ranchers, and townsfolk). The ambience is usually punctuated with a Western music score, including American and Mexican folk music such as country, Native American music, New Mexico music, and rancheras.\\r\\n\\r\\nWesterns often stress the harshness of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape of deserts and mountains. Often, the vast landscape plays an important role, presenting a \\"...mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West\\".[2] Specific settings include ranches, small frontier towns, saloons, railways and isolated military forts of the Wild West. \\r\\n\\r\\nCommon plots include:\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Westerns use a stock plot of depicting a crime, then showing the pursuit of the wrongdoer, ending in revenge and retribution, which is often dispensed through a shootout or quick draw duel.[3][4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Western was the most popular Hollywood genre, from the early 20th century to the 1960s.[6]\\r\\nWestern films first became well-attended in the 1930s. John Ford's landmark Western adventure Stagecoach became one of the biggest hits in 1939 and it made John Wayne a mainstream screen star. Westerns were very popular throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Many of the most acclaimed Westerns were released during this time ÿ including High Noon (1952), Shane (1953), The Searchers (1956), and The Wild Bunch (1969). Classic Westerns such as these have been the inspiration for various films about Western-type characters in contemporary settings, such as Junior Bonner (1972), set in the 1970s, and The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada (2005), which is set in the 21st century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Western genre sometimes portrays the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature in the name of civilization or the confiscation of the territorial rights of the original, Native American, inhabitants of the frontier.[1]  The Western depicts a society organized around codes of honor and personal, direct or private justiceÿ\\"frontier justice\\"ÿdispensed by gunfights. These honor codes are often played out through depictions of feuds or individuals seeking personal revenge or retribution against someone who has wronged them (e.g., True Grit has revenge and retribution as its main themes). This Western depiction of personal justice contrasts sharply with justice systems organized around rationalistic, abstract law that exist in cities, in which social order is maintained predominately through relatively impersonal institutions such as courtrooms. The popular perception of the Western is a story that centers on the life of a semi-nomadic wanderer, usually a cowboy or a gunfighter.[1]  A showdown or duel at high noon featuring two or more gunfighters is a stereotypical scene in the popular conception of Westerns.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some ways, such protagonists may be considered the literary descendants of the knight errant which stood at the center of earlier extensive genres such as the Arthurian Romances.[1] Like the cowboy or gunfighter of the Western, the knight errant of the earlier European tales and poetry was wandering from place to place on his horse, fighting villains of various kinds and bound to no fixed social structures but only to his own innate code of honor. And like knights errant, the heroes of Westerns frequently rescue damsels in distress. Similarly, the wandering protagonists of Westerns share many characteristics with the ronin in modern Japanese culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Western typically takes these elements and uses them to tell simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of John Ford or Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, about an old hired killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Specific settings include isolated forts, ranches and homesteads; the Native American village; or the small frontier town with its saloon, general store, livery stable and jailhouse and the open desert, where there are no structures and only windswept sand dunes. Apart from the wilderness, it is usually the saloon that emphasizes that this is the Wild West: it is the place to go for music (raucous piano playing), women (often prostitutes), gambling (draw poker or five card stud), drinking (beer or whiskey), brawling and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as Sergio Leone said, \\"where life has no value\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Film Institute defines Western films as those \\"set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the new frontier.\\"[7]  The term Western, used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in Motion Picture World magazine.[8] Most of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th century popular Western fiction and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form.[9]  Western films commonly feature protagonists such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear Stetson hats, bandannas, spurs, and buckskins, use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survivalÿand as a means to settle disputes using \\"frontier justice\\". Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWestern films were enormously popular in the silent film era (1894-1927). With the advent of sound in 1927-28, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns,[citation needed] leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a \\"pulp\\" genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as Dodge City starring Errol Flynn, Jesse James with Tyrone Power, Union Pacific with Joel McCrea, Destry Rides Again featuring James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich, and the release of John Ford's landmark Western adventure Stagecoach, which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, Stagecoach made John Wayne a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining B westerns. Wayne had been introduced to the screen ten years earlier as the leading man in director Raoul Walsh's widescreen The Big Trail, which failed at the box office, due in part to exhibitors' inability to switch over to widescreen during the Depression. After the Western's renewed commercial successes in the late 1930s, the popularity of the Western continued to rise until its peak in the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nWestern films often depict conflicts with Native Americans. While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the \\"Injuns\\" as dishonorable villains, the later and more culturally neutral Westerns gave Native Americans a more sympathetic treatment.  Other recurring themes of Westerns include Western treks (e.g. The Big Trail) or perilous journeys (e.g. Stagecoach) or groups of bandits terrorising small towns such as in The Magnificent Seven. Or revisionist westerns like I Walk the Line (1970) depict sheriffs dueling.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio, just like other early Hollywood films, but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s, producers of Westerns used desolate corners of Arizona, California, Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, or Wyoming. These settings gave filmmakers the ability to depict vast plains, looming mountains and epic canyons. Productions were also filmed on location at movie ranches.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOften, the vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film. After the early 1950s, various wide screen formats such as Cinemascope (1953) and VistaVision used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular Western landscapes. John Ford's use of Monument Valley as an expressive landscape in his films from Stagecoach (1939) to Cheyenne Autumn (1965) \\"present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans\\".[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthor and screenwriter Frank Gruber described seven plots for Westerns:[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nGruber said that good writers used dialogue and plot development to develop these basic plots into believable stories.[12] Other subgenres include:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the Western was reinvented with the revisionist Western.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Train Robbery (1903), Edwin S. Porter's film starring Broncho Billy Anderson, is often cited as the first Western, though George N. Fenin and William K. Everson point out that the \\"Edison company had played with Western material for several years prior to The Great Train Robbery. \\" Nonetheless, they concur that Porter's film \\"set the patternof crime, pursuit, and retributionfor the Western film as a genre.\\"[14] The film's popularity opened the door for Anderson to become the screen's first cowboy star; he made several hundred Western film shorts. So popular was the genre that he soon faced competition from Tom Mix and William S. Hart.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Golden Age of the Western is epitomized by the work of several directors, most prominent among them, John Ford (My Darling Clementine, The Horse Soldiers, The Searchers). Others include: Howard Hawks (Red River, Rio Bravo), Anthony Mann (Man of the West, The Man from Laramie), Budd Boetticher (Seven Men from Now), Delmer Daves (The Hanging Tree, 3:10 to Yuma), John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven, Last Train from Gun Hill), and Robert Aldrich (Vera Cruz, Ulzana's Raid).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilm critic Jonathan Rosenbaum refers to a makeshift 1960s and 1970s genre called the Acid Western,[15] associated with Dennis Hopper, Jim McBride, and Rudy Wurlitzer, as well as films like Monte Hellman's The Shooting (1966), Alejandro Jodorowsky's bizarre experimental film El Topo (The Mole) (1970),[15] and Robert Downey Sr.'s Greaser's Palace (1972).[15] The 1970 film El Topo is an allegorical cult Western and underground film about the eponymous character, a violent black-clad gunfighter, and his quest for enlightenment. The film is filled with bizarre characters and occurrences, use of maimed and dwarf performers, and heavy doses of Christian symbolism and Eastern philosophy. Some Spaghetti Westerns also crossed over into the Acid Western genre, such as Enzo G. Castellari's mystical Keoma (1976), a Western reworking of Ingmar Bergman's metaphysical The Seventh Seal (1957).\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recent Acid Westerns include Alex Cox's film Walker (1987) and Jim Jarmusch's film Dead Man (1995). Rosenbaum describes the Acid Western as \\"formulating a chilling, savage frontier poetry to justify its hallucinated agenda\\"; ultimately, he says, the Acid Western expresses a counterculture sensibility to critique and replace capitalism with alternative forms of exchange.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nCharro Westerns, often featuring musical stars as well as action, have been a standard feature of Mexican cinema since the 1930s. In the 1930s and 1940s, these were typically films about horsemen in rural Mexican society, displaying a set of cultural concerns very different from the Hollywood meta-narrative, but the overlap between 'charro' movies and westerns became more apparent in the 1950s and 1960s.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis subgenre is imitative in style in order to mock, comment on, or trivialize the Western genre's established traits, subjects, auteurs' styles, or some other target by means of humorous, satiric, or ironic imitation or parody. Examples include The Paleface (1948), Carry On Cowboy (1965), Cat Ballou (1965), The Hallelujah Trail (1965), Texas Across the River (1966), The Scalphunters (1968), Support Your Local Sheriff! (1969), Support Your Local Gunfighter (1971),  Blazing Saddles (1974), Rustlers' Rhapsody (1985), Three Amigos (1986), Maverick (1994), Quick Draw (2013) and A Million Ways to Die in the West (2014).\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso known as Neo-Westerns, these films have contemporary U.S. settings, and they utilize Old West themes and motifs (a rebellious anti-hero, open plains and desert landscapes, and gunfights). For the most part, they still take place in the American West and reveal the progression of the Old West mentality into the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This subgenre often features Old West-type characters struggling with displacement in a \\"civilized\\" world that rejects their outdated brand of justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples include John Sturges's Bad Day at Black Rock (1955); Lonely Are the Brave , screenplay by Dalton Trumbo (1962), Hud, starring Paul Newman (1963); Robert Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971); The Getaway (1972); Junior Bonner (1972); Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974); Hearts of the West starring Jeff Bridges (1975); Alan J. Pakula's Comes a Horseman (1978); J. W. Coop, directed/co-written by and starring Cliff Robertson; Robert Rodrguez's El Mariachi (1992) and Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003); John Sayles's Lone Star (1996); Tommy Lee Jones's The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada (2005); Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain (2005); Wim Wenders's Don't Come Knocking (2005); Joel and Ethan Coen's No Country for Old Men (2007); the television show Justified (2010ÿ2015); Hell or High Water (2016) and Wind River (2017), both written by Taylor Sheridan; and the superhero film Logan (2017). Call of Juarez: The Cartel is an example of a Neo-Western video game. Likewise, the television series Breaking Bad, which takes place in modern times, features many examples of Western archetypes. According to creator Vince Gilligan, \\"After the first Breaking Bad episode, it started to dawn on me that we could be making a contemporary western. So you see scenes that are like gunfighters squaring off, like Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleefwe have Walt and others like that.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe precursor to these[citation needed] was the radio series Tales of the Texas Rangers (1950ÿ1952), with Joel McCrea, a contemporary detective drama set in Texas, featuring many of the characteristics of traditional Westerns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1971 film Zachariah starring John Rubinstein, Don Johnson and Pat Quinn was billed as, \\"The first electric Western.\\"[20] The film featured multiple performing rock bands in an otherwise American West setting.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nZachariah featured appearances and music supplied by rock groups from the 1970s, including the James Gang[20] and Country Joe and the Fish as \\"The Cracker Band.\\"[20] Fiddler Doug Kershaw had a musical cameo[20] as does Elvin Jones as a gunslinging drummer named Job Cain.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe independent film Hate Horses starring Dominique Swain, Ron Thompson and Paul Dooley billed itself as, \\"The second electric Western.\\"[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe epic western is a subgenre of the western that emphasizes the story of the American Old West on a grand scale. Many epic westerns are commonly set during a turbulent time, especially a war, as in Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), set during the American Civil War, or Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch (1969), set during the Mexican Revolution. One of the grandest films in this genre is Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), which shows many operatic conflicts centered on control of a town while utilizing wide scale shots on Monument Valley locations against a broad running time. Other notable examples include The Iron Horse (1924), Duel in the Sun (1946), The Searchers (1956), Giant (1956), The Big Country (1958), Cimarron (1960), How the West Was Won (1962), Duck, You Sucker! (1971), Heaven's Gate (1980), Dances with Wolves (1990), The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), Django Unchained (2012) and  The Revenant (2015).\\r\\n\\r\\nEuro Westerns are Western genre films made in Western Europe. The term can sometimes, but not necessarily, include the Spaghetti Western subgenre (see below). One example of a Euro Western is the Anglo-Spanish film The Savage Guns (1961).  Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed Sauerkraut Westerns[22] because they were made in Germany and shot in Yugoslavia, were derived from stories by novelist Karl May and were film adaptations of May's work. In the 2010s some new euro-westerns emerged like Kristian Levring's The Salvation, Martin Koolhoven's Brimstone and Andreas Prochaska's The Dark Valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nFantasy Westerns mixed in fantasy settings and themes, and may include Fantasy mythology as background. Some famous examples are Stephen King's The Stand and The Dark Tower series of novels, the Vertigo comics series Preacher, and Keiichi Sigsawa's light novel series, Kino's Journey, illustrated by Kouhaku Kuroboshi.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlorida Westerns, also known as Cracker Westerns, are set in Florida during the Second Seminole War. An example would be Distant Drums (1951) starring Gary Cooper.\\r\\n\\r\\nA developing subgenre,[citation needed] with roots in films such as Curse of the Undead (1959) and Billy the Kid vs. Dracula (1966), which depicts the legendary outlaw Billy the Kid fighting against the notorious vampire. Another example is The Ghoul Goes West, an unproduced Ed Wood film to star Bela Lugosi as Dracula in the Old West.[citation needed]  Recent examples include the films Near Dark (1987) directed by Kathryn Bigelow which tells the story about a human falling in love with a vampire, From Dusk till Dawn (1996) by Robert Rodriguez deals with outlaws battling vampires across the border, Vampires (1998) by John Carpenter tells about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the west, Ravenous (1999), which deals with cannibalism at a remote US army outpost; The Burrowers (2008), about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures; and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012). Undead Nightmare (2010), an expansion to Red Dead Redemption (2010) is an example of a video game in this genre, telling the tale of a zombie outbreak in the Old West. Bone Tomahawk (2016) one of the most recent entries in the genre received wide critical acclaim for its chilling tale of cannibalism but, like many other movies in the genre, it wasn't a commercial success.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Western films made in India - Mosagaalaku Mosagaadu (1970), made in Telugu, Mappusakshi (Malayalam),[citation needed] Ganga (1972), and Jakkamma (Tamil)[citation needed] - were based on Classic Westerns. Thazhvaram (1990), the Malayalam film directed by Bharathan and written by noted writer M. T. Vasudevan Nair, is perhaps the most resemblant of the Spaghetti Westerns in terms of production and cinematic techniques. Earlier Spaghetti Westerns laid the groundwork for such films as Adima Changala (1971) starring Prem Nazir, a hugely popular \\"zapata Spaghetti Western film in Malayalam, and Sholay (1975) Khote Sikkay (1973)  and Thai Meethu Sathiyam (1978) are notable Curry Westerns. Kodama Simham (1990), a Telugu action film starring Chiranjeevi and Mohan Babu was one more addition to the Indo Western genre and fared well at the box office. It was also the first South Indian movie to be dubbed in English as Hunters of the Indian Treasure[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nTakkari Donga (2002), starring Telugu Maheshbabu, was applauded by critics but an average runner at box office. Quick Gun Murugun (2009), an Indian comedy film which spoofs Indian Western movies, is based on a character created for television promos at the time of the launch of the music network Channel [V] in 1994, which had cult following.[citation needed] Irumbukkottai Murattu Singam (2010), a Western adventure comedy film, based on cowboy movies and paying homages to the John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, and Jaishankar, was made in Tamil.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile many of these mash-ups (e.g., Billy Jack (1971) and its sequel The Trial of Billy Jack (1974)) are cheap exploitation films, others are more serious dramas such as the Kung Fu TV series, which ran from 1972 to 1975. Comedy examples include the Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson collaboration Shanghai Noon (2000). Further sub-divisions of this subgenre include Ninja Westerns and Samurai Westerns (incorporating samurai cinema themes), such as Red Sun (1971) with Charles Bronson and Toshiro Mifune.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Meat pie Western (also Kangaroo Western)(a slang term which plays on the Italo-western moniker \\"Spaghetti Western\\") is an American Western-style movie or TV series set in Australia, especially the Australian Outback or the Australian Bush.[24] Films such as Rangle River (1936), Kangaroo (1952), the television series Whiplash (1961), Mad Dog Morgan (1976), The Man from Snowy River (1982), Five Mile Creek (1983ÿ85), Quigley Down Under (1991), and The Proposition (2005) are all representative of the genre. The term is used to differentiate more Americanized Australian films from those with a more historical basis, such as those about bushrangers.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Northern genre is a subgenre of Westerns taking place in Alaska or Western Canada. Examples include several versions of the Rex Beach novel, The Spoilers (including 1930's The Spoilers, with Gary Cooper, and 1942's The Spoilers, with Marlene Dietrich, Randolph Scott and Wayne); The Far Country (1954) with James Stewart; North to Alaska (1960) with Wayne;  Death Hunt (1981) with Charles Bronson; and The Grey Fox (1983) with Richard Farnsworth.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsterns, also known as \\"Red Western\\"s, are produced in Eastern Europe. They were popular in Communist Eastern European countries and were a particular favorite of Joseph Stalin,[citation needed] and usually portrayed the American Indians sympathetically, as oppressed people fighting for their rights, in contrast to American Westerns of the time, which frequently portrayed the Indians as villains. Osterns frequently featured Gypsies or Turkic people in the role of the Indians,[citation needed] due to the shortage of authentic Indians in Eastern Europe.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGojko Miti? portrayed righteous, kind-hearted, and charming Indian chiefs (e.g., in Die S?hne der gro?en B?rin (1966) directed by Josef Mach). He became honorary chief of the Sioux tribe, when he visited the United States in the 1990s and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his films. American actor and singer Dean Reed, an expatriate who lived in East Germany, also starred in several Ostern films.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most rare of the Western subgenres, pornographic Westerns use the Old West as a background for stories primarily focused on erotica. The three major examples of the porn Western film are Russ Meyer's nudie-cutie Wild Gals of the Naked West (1962), and the hardcore A Dirty Western (1975) and Sweet Savage (1979). Sweet Savage starred Aldo Ray, a veteran actor who had appeared in traditional Westerns, in a non-sex role. Among videogames, Custer's Revenge (1982) is an infamous example, considered to be one of the worst video games of all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the early 1960s, many American filmmakers began to question and change many traditional elements of Westerns, and to make Revisionist Westerns that encouraged audiences to question the simple hero-versus-villain dualism and the morality of using violence to test one's character or to prove oneself right. This is shown in Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch (1969). One major revision was the increasingly positive representation of Native Americans, who had been treated as \\"savages\\" in earlier films. Examples of such revisionist Westerns include Ride the High Country (1962),Richard Harris' A Man Called Horse (1970), Little Big Man (1970), Soldier Blue (1970), Man in the Wilderness (1971), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Dances with Wolves (1990) and Dead Man (1995). A few earlier Revisionist Westerns gave women more powerful roles, such as Westward the Women (1951) starring Robert Taylor.  Another earlier work encompassed all these features, The Last Wagon (1956). In it, Richard Widmark played a white man raised by Comanches and persecuted by whites, with Felicia Farr and Susan Kohner playing young women forced into leadership roles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe science fiction Western places science fiction elements within a traditional Western setting. Examples include Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter (1965),The Valley of Gwangi (1969) featuring cowboys and dinosaurs. John Jakes's \\"Six Gun Planet\\" takes place on a future planet colonized by people consciously seeking to recreate the Old West (with cowboys riding robot horses...) [1][permanent dead link]. The movie Westworld (1973) and its sequel Futureworld (1976), Back to the Future Part III (1990), Wild Wild West (1999), Cowboys & Aliens (2011), and the TV series Westworld (2016, based on the movie). Fallout: New Vegas (2010) is an example of a video game that follows this format, with futuristic technology and genetic mutations placed among the western themes and desert sprawl of the Mojave Wasteland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Space Western or Space Frontier is a subgenre of science fiction which uses the themes and tropes of Westerns within science fiction stories. Subtle influences may include exploration of new, lawless frontiers, while more overt influences may feature literal cowboys in outer space who use ray guns and ride robotic horses. Examples include the American television series Brave Starr (which aired original episodes from September 1987 to February 1988) and Firefly (created by Joss Whedon in 2002), and the films Battle Beyond the Stars (1980), which is a remake of The Magnificent Seven; Outland (1981), which is a remake of High Noon; and Serenity (2005, based on the Firefly TV series). The classic western genre has also been a major influence on science fiction films such as the original Star Wars movie of 1977. Famously Gene Roddenberry pitched the concept of the TV show Star Trek as a Wagon Train to the stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a revival of the Western emerged in Italy with the \\"Spaghetti Westerns\\" also known as \\"Italo-Westerns\\". The most famous of them is The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966).  Many of these films are low-budget affairs, shot in locations (for example, the Spanish desert region of Almera) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs as well as their similarity to landscapes of the Southwestern United States. Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns. Also, the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives (money or revenge being the most common) than in the classical westerns.[26] Some Spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition, and some films from the genre are considered revisionist Westerns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Western films directed by Sergio Leone were felt by some to have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns.[27] Veteran American actors Charles Bronson, Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood[27] became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as James Coburn, Henry Fonda, Rod Steiger, Klaus Kinski, and Jason Robards. Eastwood, previously the lead in the television series Rawhide, unexpectedly found himself catapulted into the forefront of the film industry by Leone's A Fistful of Dollars.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Weird Western subgenre blends elements of a classic Western with other elements. The Wild Wild West television series, television movies, and 1999 film adaptation blend the Western with steampunk. The Jonah Hex franchise also blends the Western with superhero elements. The film Western Religion (2015), by writer and director James O'Brien, introduces the devil into a traditional wild west setting. Old Man Logan (2008-2009) graphic novel combines the elements of superhero and post-apocalyptic fiction with western.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s academic and critical attention to cinema as a legitimate art form emerged. With the increased attention, film theory was developed to attempt to understand the significance of film. From this environment emerged (in conjunction with the literary movement) an enclave of critical studies called genre studies. This was primarily a semantic and structuralist approach to understanding how similar films convey meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the results of genre studies is that some[who?] have argued that \\"Westerns\\" need not take place in the American West or even in the 19th century, as the codes can be found in other types of films. For example, a very typical Western plot is that an eastern lawman heads west, where he matches wits and trades bullets with a gang of outlaws and thugs, and is aided by a local lawman who is well-meaning but largely ineffective until a critical moment when he redeems himself by saving the hero's life. This description can be used to describe any number of Westerns, but also other films such as Die Hard (itself a loose reworking of High Noon) and Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, which are frequently cited examples of films that do not take place in the American West but have many themes and characteristics common to Westerns. Likewise, films set in the American Old West may not necessarily be considered \\"Westerns.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing period drama pieces, both the Western and samurai genre influenced each other in style and themes throughout the years.[28] The Magnificent Seven was a remake of Akira Kurosawa's film The Seven Samurai, and A Fistful of Dollars was a remake of Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which itself was inspired by Red Harvest, an American detective novel by Dashiell Hammett.[29] Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was a fan of the genre, most especially John Ford.[30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the Cold War, the Western was a strong influence on Eastern Bloc cinema, which had its own take on the genre, the so-called \\"Red Western\\" or \\"Ostern\\". Generally these took two forms: either straight Westerns shot in the Eastern Bloc, or action films involving the Russian Revolution and civil war and the Basmachi rebellion.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn offshoot of the Western genre is the \\"post-apocalyptic\\" Western, in which a future society, struggling to rebuild after a major catastrophe, is portrayed in a manner very similar to the 19th century frontier. Examples include The Postman and the Mad Max series, and the computer game series Fallout. Many elements of space travel series and films borrow extensively from the conventions of the Western genre. This is particularly the case in the space Western subgenre of science fiction. Peter Hyams' Outland transferred the plot of High Noon to Io, moon of Jupiter. Gene Roddenberry, the creator of the Star Trek series, pitched his show as \\"Wagon Train to the stars\\" early on, but admitted later that this was more about getting it produced in a time that loved Western-themed TV series than about its actual content.[citation needed] The Book of Eli depicts the post apocalypse as a Western with large knives.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recently, the space opera series Firefly used an explicitly Western theme for its portrayal of frontier worlds. Anime shows like Cowboy Bebop, Trigun and Outlaw Star have been similar mixes of science fiction and Western elements. The science fiction Western can be seen as a subgenre of either Westerns or science fiction. Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. For example, Kelly's Heroes is a war film, but action and characters are Western-like. The British film Zulu set during the Anglo-Zulu War has sometimes been compared to a Western, even though it is set in South Africa.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character played by Humphrey Bogart in film noir films such as Casablanca and To Have and Have Notan individual bound only by his own private code of honorhas a lot in common with the classic Western hero. In turn, the Western, has also explored noir elements, as with the films Pursued and Sugar Creek.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many of Robert A. Heinlein's books, the settlement of other planets is depicted in ways explicitly modeled on American settlement of the West. For example, in his Tunnel in the Sky settlers set out to the planet \\"New Canaan\\", via an interstellar teleporter portal across the galaxy, in Conestoga wagons, their captain sporting mustaches and a little goatee and riding a Palomino horsewith Heinlein explaining that the colonists would need to survive on their own for some years, so horses are more practical than machines.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nStephen King's The Dark Tower is a series of seven books that meshes themes of Westerns, high fantasy, science fiction and horror. The protagonist Roland Deschain is a gunslinger whose image and personality are largely inspired by the \\"Man with No Name\\" from Sergio Leone's films. In addition, the superhero fantasy genre has been described as having been derived from the cowboy hero, only powered up to omnipotence in a primarily urban setting. The Western genre has been parodied on a number of occasions, famous examples being Support Your Local Sheriff!, Cat Ballou, Mel Brooks's Blazing Saddles, and Rustler's Rhapsody.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Lucas's Star Wars films use many elements of a Western, and Lucas has said he intended for Star Wars to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held. The Jedi, who take their name from Jidaigeki, are modeled after samurai, showing the influence of Kurosawa. The character Han Solo dressed like an archetypal gunslinger, and the Mos Eisley Cantina is much like an Old West saloon.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, films such as The Big Lebowski, which plucked actor Sam Elliott out of the Old West and into a Los Angeles bowling alley, and Midnight Cowboy, about a Southern-boy-turned-gigolo in New York (who disappoints a client when he doesn't measure up to Gary Cooper), transplanted Western themes into modern settings for both purposes of parody and homage.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nWestern fiction is a genre of literature set in the American Old West, most commonly between the years of 1860 and 1900. The first critically recognized Western was The Virginian (1902) by Owen Wister.\\"Classic Wild West Literature\\".? Other well-known writers of Western fiction include Zane Grey, from the early 1900s, Ernest Haycox, Luke Short, and Louis L'Amour, from the mid 20th century. Many writers better known in other genres, such as Leigh Brackett, Elmore Leonard, and Larry McMurtry, have also written Western novels. The genre's popularity peaked in the 1960s, due in part to the shuttering of many pulp magazines, the popularity of televised Westerns, and the rise of the spy novel. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside of a few Western states, now only carry a small number of Western novels and short story collections.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nLiterary forms that share similar themes include stories of the American frontier, the gaucho literature of Argentina, and tales of the settlement of the Australian Outback.\\r\\n\\r\\nTelevision Westerns are a subgenre of the Western. When television became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, TV Westerns quickly became an audience favorite.[34] Beginning with re-broadcasts of existing films, a number of movie cowboys had their own TV shows. As demand for the Western increased, new stories and stars were introduced. A number of long-running TV Westerns became classics in their own right, such as: The Lone Ranger (1949-1957), The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp (1955-1961), Gunsmoke (1955-1975),  Maverick (1957-1962), Have Gun ÿ Will Travel (1957-1963), Wagon Train (1957-1965), Sugarfoot (1957-1961), The Rifleman (1958-1963), Rawhide (1959-1966), Bonanza (1959-1973),  The Virginian (1962-1971), and The Big Valley (1965-1969).   The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp was the first Western television series written for adults,[35] premiering four days before Gunsmoke on September 6, 1955.[36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peak year for television Westerns was 1959, with 26 such shows airing during primetime. At least six of them were connected in some extent to Wyatt Earp: The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Tombstone Territory, Broken Arrow, Johnny Ringo, and Gunsmoke.[38] Increasing costs of American television production weeded out most action half hour series in the early 1960s, and their replacement by hour-long television shows, increasingly in color.[39] Traditional Westerns died out in the late 1960s as a result of network changes in demographic targeting along with pressure from parental television groups. Future entries in the genre would incorporate elements from other genera, such as crime drama and mystery whodunit elements. Western shows from the 1970s included Hec Ramsey, Kung Fu, Little House on the Prairie, and McCloud. In the 1990s and 2000s, hour-long Westerns and slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced, such as: Lonesome Dove (1989) and Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. As well, new elements were once again added to the Western formula, such as the Western-science fiction show Firefly, created by Joss Whedon in 2002. Deadwood was a critically acclaimed Western series which aired on HBO from 2004 through 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of visual artists focused their work on representations of the American Old West. American West-oriented art is sometimes referred to as \\"Western Art\\" by Americans. This relatively new category of art includes paintings, sculptures, and sometimes Native American crafts. Initially, subjects included exploration of the Western states and cowboy themes. Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell are two artists who captured the \\"Wild West\\" on canvas.[40] Some art museums, such as the Buffalo Bill Center of the West in Wyoming and the Autry National Center in Los Angeles, feature American Western Art.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe popularity of Westerns extends beyond films, literature, television, and visual art to include numerous other media forms.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith anime and manga, the genre tends towards the Science fiction Western [e.g., Cowboy Bebop (1998 anime), Trigun (1995-2007 manga), and Outlaw Star (1996-1999 manga)]. Although contemporary Westerns also appear, such as Kya no Shnen Isamu, a 1971 shnen manga about a boy with a Japanese father and a Native American mother, or El Cazador de la Bruja, a 2007 anime television series set in modern-day Mexico. Part 7 of the manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is based in the American Western setting. The story follows racers in a transcontinental horse race, the \\"Steel Ball Run\\" race.\\r\\n\\r\\nWestern comics have included serious entries (such as the classic comics of the late 1940s and early 1950s[specify]), cartoons, and parodies (such as Cocco Bill and Lucky Luke). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics leaned toward the Weird West subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in Preacher. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period (e.g., Jonah Hex and Loveless).\\r\\n\\r\\nWestern arcade games, computer games, role-playing games, and video games are often either straightforward Westerns or Western Horror hybrids.  Some Western themed-computer games include The Oregon Trail (1971), Mad Dog McCree (1990), Sunset Riders (1991), Outlaws (1997), Red Dead Revolver (2004), Gun (2005), Call of Juarez (2007), Red Dead Redemption (2010), and Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018). Other video games adapt the Science fiction Western or Weird West subgenres such as Fallout (1997), Gunman Chronicles (2000), Darkwatch (2005), the Borderlands series (first released in 2009), Fallout: New Vegas (2010), and Hard West (2015).\\r\\n\\r\\nWestern radio dramas were very popular from the 1930s to the 1960s.  Some popular shows include The Lone Ranger (first broadcast in 1933), The Cisco Kid (first broadcast in 1942), Dr. Sixgun (first broadcast in 1954), Have GunÿWill Travel (first broadcast in 1958), and Gunsmoke (first broadcast in 1952).[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nWesterns have been showcased in short episodic web series. Examples include League of STEAM, Red Bird and Arkansas Traveler.","input":"During what decade did the genre of the western become established?"},{"output":"William December \\"Billy Dee\\" Williams Jr.","context":"William December \\"Billy Dee\\" Williams Jr. (born April 6, 1937) is an American actor, artist, singer, and writer. He is best known for his role as Lando Calrissian in the Star Wars film franchise. Williams has also appeared in critically acclaimed films like Brian's Song, Lady Sings the Blues, Mahogany, Nighthawks, and Batman; in which he played Harvey Dent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliams was born in New York, the son of Loretta Anne (1915-2016),[citation needed] a West Indian-born elevator operator from Montserrat, and William December Williams, Sr. (1910-2007), an African-American caretaker from Texas.[1][2] He has a twin sister, Loretta, and grew up in Harlem, where he was raised by his maternal grandmother while his parents worked at several jobs. Williams graduated from The High School of Music & Art (later merged with the High School of Performing Arts to become the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art) in Manhattan, where he was a classmate of Diahann Carroll, who would later play the wife of his character Brady Lloyd on the 1980s prime-time soap opera Dynasty.\\r\\nWilliams first appeared on Broadway in 1945 in The Firebrand of Florence.[3] He returned to Broadway as an adult in 1960 in the adaptation of The Cool Word. He appeared in A Taste of Honey in 1961. A 1976 Broadway production, I Have a Dream, was directed by Robert Greenwald and starred Williams as Martin Luther King Jr.[4] His most recent Broadway appearance was in August Wilson's Fences, as a replacement for James Earl Jones in the role of Troy Maxson in 1988.[5]\\r\\nWilliams made his film debut in 1959 in The Last Angry Man, opposite Paul Muni, in which he portrayed a delinquent young man. He rose to stardom after starring in the critically lauded blockbuster biographical television movie, Brian's Song (1971), in which he played Chicago Bears star football player Gale Sayers, who stood by his friend Brian Piccolo (played by James Caan), during Piccolo's struggle with terminal cancer. The film was so popular that it was given a theatrical release. Both Williams and Caan were nominated for Emmy Awards for best actor for their performances.[citation needed]\\r\\nHaving broken through, Williams became one of America's most well-known black film actors of the 1970s, after starring in a string of critically acclaimed and popular movies, many of them in the \\"blaxploitation\\" genre. In 1972, he starred as Billie Holiday's husband Louis McKay in Motown Productions' Holiday biopic Lady Sings the Blues. The film was a box office blockbuster, becoming one of the highest-grossing films of the year and received five Academy Award nominations. Diana Ross starred in Lady Sings the Blues opposite Williams; Motown paired the two of them again three years later in the successful follow-up project Mahogany.\\r\\nIn early 1980s Williams played Lando Calrissian in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Calrissian's charm proved to be popular with audiences. He reprised the role when he lent his voice for the character in the 2002 video game Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, as well as the audio dramatization of Dark Empire, the National Public Radio adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back, two productions for the Star Wars: Battlefront series: Star Wars: Battlefront II and Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron and in two episodes of the animated TV series Star Wars: Rebels. Between his appearances in the Star Wars films, he starred alongside Sylvester Stallone as a cop in the 1981 thriller Nighthawks.\\r\\nHe co-starred in 1989's Batman as district attorney Harvey Dent, a role that was planned to develop into Dent's alter-ego, the villain Two-Face, in sequels. Unfortunately for Williams, that never came to pass; he was set to reprise the role in the sequel Batman Returns, but his character was deleted and replaced with villain Max Shreck. When Joel Schumacher stepped in to direct Batman Forever, where Two-Face was to be a secondary villain, Schumacher decided to hire Tommy Lee Jones for the role.[6] There was a rumor that Schumacher had to pay Williams a fee in order to hire Jones, but Williams said that it was not true: \\"You only get paid if you do the movie. I had a two-picture deal with Star Wars. They paid me for that, but I only had a one picture deal for Batman.\\"[7] Williams eventually voiced Two-Face in the 2017 film The Lego Batman Movie.[8]\\r\\nAfter The Walt Disney Company acquired ownership of Lucasfilm in 2012, plans for a sequel trilogy to the Star Wars films were announced. On April 29, 2014, Disney announced a cast list for Star Wars Episode VII, set decades after Episode VI. The confirmed cast included the actors who portrayed Han Solo, Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker, along with Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2, but Calrissian's character was omitted. Fans made their displeasure known on social networks immediately.[9]\\r\\nWilliams's television work included a recurring guest-starring role on the short-lived show Gideon's Crossing. He is also well known for his appearance in advertisements for Colt 45 (a brand of malt liquor) in the 1980s and early 1990s, for which he received much criticism. Williams responded indifferently to the criticism of his appearances in the liquor commercials. When questioned about his appearances, he allegedly replied by saying, \\"I drink, you drink. Hell, if marijuana was legal, I'd appear in a commercial for it.\\"[10]\\r\\nIn the 1984ÿ1985 season of Dynasty, he played Brady Lloyd opposite Diahann Carroll.\\r\\nWilliams was paired with actress Marla Gibbs on three situation comedies: The Jeffersons (Gibbs's character, Florence, had a crush on Williams and challenged him on everything because she thought he was an imposter); 227 (her character, Mary, pretending to be royalty, met Williams at a banquet); and The Hughleys (Gibbs and Williams portrayed Darryl's parents).\\r\\nIn 1992, he portrayed Berry Gordy in The Jacksons: An American Dream.\\r\\nIn 1993, Williams had a guest appearance on the spin-off to The Cosby Show, A Different World, as Langston Paige, a grumpy landlord, in a backdoor pilot for his own series.

Guns, bombs, rockets and cannons were first invented in China during the Han Chinese Song Dynasty and then later spread to Europe and the Middle East during the period.\\r\\nAlthough gunpowder was known in Europe during the High Middle Ages due to the usage of guns and explosives by the Mongols and the Chinese firearms experts employed by the Mongols as mercenaries during the Mongol conquests of Europe, it was not until the Late Middle Ages that European versions of cannons were widely developed. The first cannons introduced into Europe were probably used in Iberia, during the Christian wars against Muslims in the 13th century; their use was also first documented in the Middle East around this time. English cannons first appeared in 1327, and later saw more general use during the Hundred Years' War, when primitive cannons were engaged at the Battle of Crcy in 1346. By the end of the 14th century, the use of cannons was also recorded in Russia, Byzantium and the Ottoman Empire.\\r\\nThe earliest medieval cannon, the pot-de-fer, had bulbous, vase-like shape, and was used more for psychological effect than for causing physical damage. The later culverin was transitional between the handgun and the full cannon, and was used as an anti-personnel weapon. During the 15th century, cannon advanced significantly, so that bombards were effective siege engines. Towards the end of the period, the cannon gradually replaced siege enginesamong other forms of aging weaponryon the battlefield.\\r\\nThe Middle English word Canon was derived from the Old Italian word cannone, meaning large tube, which came from Latin canna, meaning cane or reed.[2] The Latinised word canon has been used for a gun since 1326 in Italy, and since 1418 in English. The word Bombardum, or \\"bombard\\", was earliest term used for \\"cannon\\", but from 1430 it came to refer only to the largest weapons.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first documented battlefield use of gunpowder artillery took place on 28 January 1132, when Song General Han Shizhong used huochong to capture a city in Fujian. The world's earliest known hand cannon is the Heilongjiang hand cannon dated 1288, which was found in Mongol-held Manchuria.[4] The first known illustration of a cannon is dated to 1326.[5] In his 1341 poem, The Iron Cannon Affair, one of the first accounts of the use of gunpowder artillery in China, Xian Zhang wrote that a cannonball fired from an eruptor could \\"pierce the heart or belly when it strikes a man or horse, and can even transfix several persons at once.\\"[6]\\r\\nThe Arabs acquired knowledge of gunpowder some time after 1240, but before 1280, by which time had written, in Arabic, recipes for gunpowder, instructions for the purification of saltpeter, and descriptions of gunpowder incendiaries.[7]\\r\\nAhmad Y. al-Hassan claims that the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260 saw the Mamluks use against the Mongols in \\"the first cannon in history\\" gunpowder formulae which were almost identical with the ideal composition for explosive gunpowder, which he claims were not known in China or Europe until much later.[8][9] However, Iqtidar Alam Khan states that it was invading Mongols who introduced gunpowder to the Islamic world[10] and cites Mamluk antagonism towards early riflemen in their infantry as an example of how gunpowder weapons were not always met with open acceptance in the Middle East.[11]\\r\\nAl-Hassan interprets Ibn Khaldun as reporting the use of cannon as siege machines by the Marinid sultan Abu Yaqub Yusuf at the siege of Sijilmasa in 1274.[8] Super-sized bombards were used by the troops of Mehmed II to capture Constantinople, in 1453. Urban, a Hungarian cannon engineer, is credited with the introduction of this cannon from Central Europe to the Ottoman realm.[12] It could fire heavy stone balls a mile, and the sound of their blast could reportedly be heard from a distance of 10 miles (16?km).[12] A piece of slightly later date (see pic) was cast in bronze and made in two parts: the chase and the breech, which, together, weighed 18.4?tonnes.[13] The two parts were screwed together using levers to facilitate the work.\\r\\nIn Europe, one of the earliest mentions of gunpowder appeared in Roger Bacon's \\"Opus Maior\\". It describes a recipe for gunpowder and recognized its military use:\\r\\nWe can, with saltpeter and other substances, compose artificially a fire that can be launched over long distances?... By only using a very small quantity of this material much light can be created accompanied by a horrible fracas. It is possible with it to destroy a town or an army?... In order to produce this artificial lightning and thunder it is necessary to take saltpeter, sulfur, and Luru Vopo Vir Can Utriet.\\r\\nIn 1250, the Norwegian Konungs skuggsj mentioned, in its military chapter, the use of \\"coal and sulphur\\" as the best weapon for ship-to-ship combat.[15]\\r\\nIn reference to the siege to Alicante in 1331, the Spanish historian Zurita recorded a \\"new machine that caused great terror. It threw iron balls with fire.\\"[8][16] The Spanish historian Juan de Mariana recalled further use of cannon during the Siege of Algeciras (1342-1344):\\r\\nThe besieged did great harm among the Christians with iron bullets they shot. This is the first time we find any mention of gunpowder and ball in our histories.\\r\\nJuan de Mariana also relates that the English Earl of Derby and Earl of Salisbury had both participated in the siege of Algeciras, and they could have conceivably transferred the knowledge about the effectiveness of cannon to England.[18]\\r\\nThe Iberian kings at the initial stages enlisted the help of Moorish experts:\\r\\nThe first artillery-masters on the Peninsula probably were Moors in Christian service. The king of Navarre had a Moor in his service in 1367 as maestro de las guarniciones de artilleria. The Morisques of Tudela at that time had fame for their capacity in reparaciones de artilleria.\\r\\nCannon seem to have been introduced to the Kingdom of England in the 14th century, and is mentioned as being in use against the Scots in 1327.[20] The first metal cannon was the pot-de-fer, first depicted in an illuminated manuscript by Walter de Milamete,[21] of 1327 that was presented to Edward III upon his accession to the English throne.[22] The manuscript shows a four-legged stand supporting a \\"bulbous bottle\\", while the gunner stands well back, firing the charge with a red-hot iron bar.[20] A bolt protrudes from the muzzle, but no wad is shown.[21] Although illustrated in the treatise, no explanation or description was given.[23]\\r\\nThis weapon, and others similar, were used by both the French and English during the Hundred Years' War (1337ÿ1453), when cannon saw their first real use on the European battlefield.[24] The cannon of the 14th century were still limited in many respects, as a modern historian summarises:\\r\\nEarly cannon were inferior in every respect to the great siege-engines: they were slow and small, they were limited [in the 14th century] to firing bolts or 'garrots' and they had a very limited range. The weaknesses were due to limited technology: inability to forge or cast in one piece or make iron balls. They were probably as dangerous to their users as to the enemy and affected the morale of men (and horses) rather than damaged persons or buildings.\\r\\nDuring the 1340s, cannon were still relatively rare, and were only used in small numbers by a few states.[26] \\"Ribaldis\\" were first mentioned in the English Privy Wardrobe accounts during preparations for the Battle of Crcy between 1345 and 1346.[26] These were believed to have shot large arrows and simple grapeshot, but they were so important they were directly controlled by the Royal Wardrobe.[26] According to the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart, the English cannon made \\"two or three discharges on the Genoese\\", which is taken to mean individual shots by two or three guns because of the time taken to reload such primitive artillery.[27] The Florentine Giovanni Villani agreed that they were destructive on the field, though he also indicated that the guns continued to fire upon French cavalry later in the battle:\\r\\nThe English guns cast iron balls by means of fire They made a noise like thunder and caused much loss in men and horses The Genoese were continually hit by the archers and the gunners [by the end of the battle] the whole plain was covered by men struck down by arrows and cannon balls.\\r\\nSimilar cannon to those used at Crcy appeared also at the Siege of Calais in the same year, and by the 1380s the \\"ribaudekin\\" clearly became mounted on wheels.[26] Wheeled gun carriages became more commonplace by the end of the 15th century, and were more often cast in bronze, rather than banding iron sections together.[28] There were still the logistical problems both of transporting and of operating the cannon, and as many three dozen horses and oxen may have been required to move some of the great guns of the period.[28]\\r\\nAnother small-bore cannon of the 14th century was the culverin, whose name derives from the snake-like handles attached to it.[29] It was transitional between the handgun and the full cannon, and was used as an anti-personnel weapon.[29] The culverin was forged of iron and fixed to a wooden stock, and usually placed on a rest for firing.[30]\\r\\nThe culverin was also common in 15th century battles, particularly among Burgundian armies.[30] As the smallest of medieval gunpowder weapons, it was relatively light and portable.[30] It fired lead shot, which was inexpensive relative to other available materials.[30]\\r\\nConsiderable developments in the 15th century produced very effective \\"bombards\\"[31]  an early form of battering cannon used against walls and towers.[29][32] These were used both defensively and offensively. Bamburgh Castle, previously thought impregnable, was taken by bombards in 1464.[31] The keep in Wark, Northumberland was described in 1517 as having five storeys \\"in each of which there were five great murder-holes, shot with great vaults of stone, except one stage which is of timber, so that great bombards can be shot from each of them.\\"[33] An example of a bombard was found in the moat of Bodiam Castle, and a replica is now kept inside.[32]\\r\\nArtillery crews were generally recruited from the city craftsmen.[34] The master gunner was usually the same person as the caster.[34] In larger contingents, the master gunners had responsibility for the heavier artillery pieces, and were accompanied by their journeymen as well as smiths, carpenters, rope makers and carters.[34] Smaller field pieces would be manned by trained volunteers.[34] At the Battle of Flodden, each cannon had its crew of gunner, matrosses and drivers, and a group of \\"pioneers\\" were assigned to level to path ahead.[28] Even with a level path, the gunpowder mixture used was unstable and could easily separate out into sulphur, saltpetre and charcoal during transport.[28]\\r\\nOnce on site, they would be fired at ground level behind a hinged timber shutter, to provide some protection to the artillery crew.[28] Timber wedges were used to control the barrel's elevation.[28] The majority of medieval cannon were breechloaders, although there was still no effort to standardise calibres.[28] The usual loading equipment consisted of a copper loading scoop, a ramrod, and a felt brush or \\"sponge\\".[34] A bucket of water was always kept beside the cannon.[34] Skins or cloths soaked in cold water could be used to cool down the barrel, while acids could also be added to the water to clean out the inside of the barrel.[34] Hot coals were used to heat the shot or keep the wire primer going.[34]\\r\\nSome Scottish kings were very interested in the development of cannon, including the unfortunate James II, who was killed by the accidental explosion of one of his own cannon besieging Roxburgh Castle in 1460.[35] Mons Meg, which dates from about the same time, is perhaps the most famous example of a Scottish cannon. James IV was Scotland's first Renaissance figure, who also had a fascination with cannon, both at land and at sea.[35] By 1502, he was able to invest in a Scottish navy, which was to have a large number of cannon  his flagship, the Great Michael, was launched in 1511, with 36 great guns, 300 lesser pieces and 120 gunners.[35]\\r\\nThe first cannon appeared in Russia in the 1370-1380s, although initially their use was confined to sieges and the defence of fortresses.[36] The first mention of cannon in Russian chronicles is of tyufyaks, small howitzer-type cannon that fired case-shot, used to defend Moscow against Tokhtamysh Khan in 1382.[36] Cannon co-existed with throwing-machines until the mid-15th century, when they overtook the latter in terms of destructive power.[36] In 1446, a Russian city fell to cannon fire for the first time, although its wall was not destroyed.[36] However it was not until 1475, when Ivan III established the first Russian cannon foundry in Moscow, which was the beginning of the native cannon production industry.[37] The first stone wall to be destroyed in Russia by cannon fire came in 1481.[36]\\r\\nDuring the 14th century, the Byzantine Empire began to accumulate its own cannon to face the Ottoman threat, starting with medium-sized cannon 3 feet (0.91?m) long and of 10\\" calibre.[38] Only a few large bombards were under the Empire's control. The first definite use of artillery in the region was against the Ottoman siege of Constantinople in 1396, as the attackers did not yet have any gunpowder of their own. These loud Byzantine weapons, possibly operated by the Genoese or \\"Franks\\" of Galata, forced the Turks to withdraw.[38]\\r\\nThe Ottomans had acquired their own cannon by the siege of 1422, using \\"falcons\\", which were short but wide cannon. The two sides were evenly matched technologically, and the Turks had to build barricades \\"in order to receive the stones of the bombards.\\"[38] Because the Empire at this time was facing economic problems, Pope Pius II promoted the affordable donation of cannon by European monarchs as a means of aid. Any new cannon after the 1422 siege were gifts from European states, and aside from these, no other advances were made to the Byzantine arsenal.[38]\\r\\nIn contrast, when Sultan Mehmet II laid siege to Constantinople in April 1453, he used 68 Hungarian-made cannon, the largest of which was 26 feet (7.9?m) long and weighed 20 tons. This fired a 1,200 pound stone cannonball, and required an operating crew of 200 men.[39] Two such bombards had initially been offered to the Byzantines by the Hungarian artillery expert Urban, which were the pinnacle of gunpowder technology at the time; he boasted that they could reduce \\"even the walls of Babylon\\".[38] However, the fact that the Byzantines could not afford it illustrates the financial costs of artillery at the time. These cannon also needed 70 oxen and 10,000 men just to transport them.[38] They were extremely loud, adding to their psychological impact, and Mehmet believed that those who unexpectedly heard it would be struck dumb.[38]\\r\\nThe 55-day bombardment of Constantinople left massive destruction, as recounted by the Greek chronicler Kritovoulos:\\r\\nAnd the stone, borne with enormous force and velocity, hit the wall, which it immediately shook and knocked down and was itself broken into many fragments and scattered, hurling the pieces everywhere and killing those who happened to be nearby.\\r\\nByzantine counter artillery allowed them to repel any visible Turkish weapons, and the defenders repulsed any attempts to storm any broken points in the walls and hastily repaired any damage. However, the walls could not be adapted for artillery, and towers were not good gun emplacements. There was even worry that the largest Byzantine cannon could cause more damage to their own walls than the Turkish cannon.[38] Gunpowder had also made the formerly devastating Greek fire obsolete, and with the final fall of what had once been the strongest walls in Europe on May 29, \\"it was the end of an era in more ways than one\\".[38]\\r\\nToward the end of the Middle Ages, the development of cannon made revolutionary changes to siege warfare throughout Europe, with many castles becoming susceptible to artillery fire. The primary aims in castle wall construction were height and thickness, but these became obsolete because they could be damaged by cannonballs.[40] Inevitably, many fortifications previously deemed impregnable proved inadequate in the face of gunpowder. The walls and towers of fortifications had to become lower and wider, and by the 1480s, \\"Italian tracing\\" had been developed, which used the corner bastion as the basis of fortifications for centuries to come.[40] The introduction of artillery to siege warfare in the Middle Ages made geometry the main element of European military architecture.[40]\\r\\nIn 16th century England, Henry VIII began building Device Forts between 1539 and 1540 as artillery fortresses to counter the threat of invasion from France and Spain. They were built by the state at strategic points for the first powerful cannon batteries, such as Deal Castle, which was perfectly symmetrical, with a low, circular keep at its centre. Over 200 cannon and gun ports were set within the walls, and the fort was essentially a firing platform, with a shape that allowed many lines of fire; its low curved bastions were designed to deflect cannonballs.[41]\\r\\nTo guard against artillery and gunfire, increasing use was made of earthen, brick and stone breastworks and redoubts, such as the geometric fortresses of the 17th century French Marquis de Vauban. Although the obsolescence of castles as fortifications was hastened by the developments of cannon from the 14th century on, many medieval castles still managed to \\"put up a prolonged resistance\\" against artillery during the English Civil War of 17th century.[42]","input":"When was gunpowder invented in the middle ages?"},{"output":"Albrecht Drer","context":"The German Renaissance, part of the Northern Renaissance, was a cultural and artistic movement that spread among German thinkers in the 15th and 16th centuries, which developed from the Italian Renaissance. Many areas of the arts and sciences were influenced, notably by the spread of Renaissance humanism to the various German states and principalities. There were many advances made in the fields of architecture, the arts, and the sciences. Germany produced two developments that were to dominate the 16th century all over Europe: printing and the Protestant Reformation.\\r\\nOne of the most important German humanists was Konrad Celtis (1459ÿ1508). Celtis studied at Cologne and Heidelberg, and later travelled throughout Italy collecting Latin and Greek manuscripts. Heavily influenced by Tacitus, he used the Germania to introduce German history and geography. Eventually he devoted his time to poetry, in which he praised Germany in Latin. Another important figure was Johann Reuchlin (1455ÿ1522) who studied in various places in Italy and later taught Greek. He studied the Hebrew language, aiming to purify Christianity, but encountered resistance from the church.\\r\\nThe most significant German Renaissance artist is Albrecht Drer especially known for his printmaking in woodcut and engraving, which spread all over Europe, drawings, and painted portraits. Important architecture of this period includes the Landshut Residence, Heidelberg Castle and the Town Hall in Augsburg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Renaissance was largely driven by the renewed interest in classical learning, and was also the result of rapid economic development. At the beginning of the 16th century, Germany was one of the most prosperous countries in Europe despite a relatively low level of urbanization compared to Italy or the Netherlands.[1][full citation needed] It benefited from the wealth of certain sectors such as metallurgy, mining, banking and textiles. More importantly, book-printing developed in Germany, and German printers dominated the new book-trade in most other countries until well into the 16th century.\\r\\nThe concept of the Northern Renaissance or German Renaissance is somewhat confused by the continuation of the use of elaborate Gothic ornament until well into the 16th century, even in works that are undoubtedly Renaissance in their treatment of the human figure and other respects. Classical ornament had little historical resonance in much of Germany, but in other respects Germany was very quick to follow developments, especially in adopting printing with movable type, a German invention that remained almost a German monopoly for some decades, and was first brought to most of Europe, including France and Italy, by Germans.[citation needed]\\r\\nPrintmaking by woodcut and engraving (thought of as a German invention yet originated in China) was already more developed in Germany and the Low Countries than anywhere else, and the Germans took the lead in developing book illustrations, typically of a relatively low artistic standard, but seen all over Europe, with the woodblocks often being lent to printers of editions in other cities or languages. The greatest artist of the German Renaissance, Albrecht Drer, began his career as an apprentice to a leading workshop in Nuremberg, that of Michael Wolgemut, who had largely abandoned his painting to exploit the new medium. Drer worked on the most extravagantly illustrated book of the period, the Nuremberg Chronicle, published by his godfather Anton Koberger, Europe's largest printer-publisher at the time.[2]\\r\\nAfter completing his apprenticeship in 1490, Drer travelled in Germany for four years, and Italy for a few months, before establishing his own workshop in Nuremberg. He rapidly became famous all over Europe for his energetic and balanced woodcuts and engravings, while also painting. Though retaining a distinctively German style, his work shows strong Italian influence, and is often taken to represent the start of the German Renaissance in visual art, which for the next forty years replaced the Netherlands and France as the area producing the greatest innovation in Northern European art. Drer supported Martin Luther but continued to create Madonnas and other Catholic imagery, and paint portraits of leaders on both sides of the emerging split of the Protestant Reformation.[2]\\r\\nDrer died in 1528, before it was clear that the split of the Reformation had become permanent, but his pupils of the following generation were unable to avoid taking sides. Most leading German artists became Protestants, but this deprived them of painting most religious works, previously the mainstay of artists' revenue. Martin Luther had objected to much Catholic imagery, but not to imagery itself, and Lucas Cranach the Elder, a close friend of Luther, had painted a number of \\"Lutheran altarpieces\\", mostly showing the Last Supper, some with portraits of the leading Protestant divines as the Twelve Apostles. This phase of Lutheran art was over before 1550, probably under the more fiercely aniconic influence of Calvinism, and religious works for public display virtually ceased to be produced in Protestant areas. Presumably largely because of this, the development of German art had virtually ceased by about 1550, but in the preceding decades German artists had been very fertile in developing alternative subjects to replace the gap in their order books. Cranach, apart from portraits, developed a format of thin vertical portraits of provocative nudes, given classical or Biblical titles.[3]\\r\\nLying somewhat outside these developments is Matthias Grnewald, who left very few works, but whose masterpiece, his Isenheim Altarpiece (completed 1515), has been widely regarded as the greatest German Renaissance painting since it was restored to critical attention in the 19th century. It is an intensely emotional work that continues the German Gothic tradition of unrestrained gesture and expression, using Renaissance compositional principles, but all in that most Gothic of forms, the multi-winged triptych.[4]\\r\\nThe Danube School is the name of a circle of artists of the first third of the 16th century in Bavaria and Austria, including Albrecht Altdorfer, Wolf Huber and Augustin Hirschvogel. With Altdorfer in the lead, the school produced the first examples of independent landscape art in the West (nearly 1,000 years after China), in both paintings and prints.[5] Their religious paintings had an expressionist style somewhat similar to Grnewald's. Drer's pupils Hans Burgkmair and Hans Baldung Grien worked largely in prints, with Baldung developing the topical subject matter of witches in a number of enigmatic prints.[6]\\r\\nHans Holbein the Elder and his brother Sigismund Holbein painted religious works in the late Gothic style. Hans the Elder was a pioneer and leader in the transformation of German art from the Gothic to the Renaissance style. His son, Hans Holbein the Younger was an important painter of portraits and a few religious works, working mainly in England and Switzerland. Holbein's well known series of small woodcuts on the Dance of Death relate to the works of the Little Masters, a group of printmakers who specialized in very small and highly detailed engravings for bourgeois collectors, including many erotic subjects.[7]\\r\\nThe outstanding achievements of the first half of the 16th century were followed by several decades with a remarkable absence of noteworthy German art, other than accomplished portraits that never rival the achievement of Holbein or Drer. The next significant German artists worked in the rather artificial style of Northern Mannerism, which they had to learn in Italy or Flanders. Hans von Aachen and the Netherlandish Bartholomeus Spranger were the leading painters at the Imperial courts in Vienna and Prague, and the productive Netherlandish Sadeler family of engravers spread out across Germany, among other counties.[8]\\r\\nIn Catholic parts of South Germany the Gothic tradition of wood carving continued to flourish until the end of the 18th century, adapting to changes in style through the centuries. Veit Stoss (d. 1533), Tilman Riemenschneider (d.1531) and Peter Vischer the Elder (d. 1529) were Drer's contemporaries, and their long careers covered the transition between the Gothic and Renaissance periods, although their ornament often remained Gothic even after their compositions began to reflect Renaissance principles.[9]\\r\\nRenaissance Architecture in Germany was inspired first by German philosophers and artists such as Albrecht Drer and Johannes Reuchlin who visited Italy. Important early examples of this period are especially the Landshut Residence, the Castle in Heidelberg, Johannisburg Palace in Aschaffenburg, the City Hall and Fugger Houses in Augsburg and St. Michael in Munich, the largest Renaissance church north of the Alps.\\r\\nA particular form of Renaissance architecture in Germany is the Weser Renaissance, with prominent examples such as the City Hall of Bremen and the Juleum in Helmstedt.\\r\\nIn July 1567 the city council of Cologne approved a design in the Renaissance style by Wilhelm Vernukken for a two storied loggia for Cologne City Hall. St Michael in Munich is the largest Renaissance church north of the Alps. It was built by Duke William V of Bavaria between 1583 and 1597 as a spiritual center for the Counter Reformation and was inspired by the Church of il Ges in Rome. The architect is unknown. Many examples of Brick Renaissance buildings can be found in Hanseatic old towns, such as Stralsund, Wismar, Lbeck, Lneburg, Friedrichstadt and Stade. Notable German Renaissance architects include Friedrich Sustris, Benedikt Rejt, Abraham van den Blocke, Elias Holl and Hans Krumpper.\\r\\nBorn Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden,[10] Johannes Gutenberg is widely considered the most influential person within the German Renaissance. As a free thinker, humanist, and inventor, Gutenberg also grew up within the Renaissance, but influenced it greatly as well. His best-known invention is the printing press in 1440. Gutenberg's press allowed the humanists, reformists, and others to circulate their ideas. He is also known as the creator of the Gutenberg Bible, a crucial work that marked the start of the \\"Gutenberg Revolution\\" and the age of the printed book in the Western world.\\r\\nJohann Reuchlin was the most important aspect of world culture teaching within Germany at this time. He was a scholar of both Greek and Hebrew. Graduating, then going on to teach at Basel, he was considered extremely intelligent. Yet after leaving Basel, he had to start copying manuscripts and apprenticing within areas of law. However, he is most known for his work within Hebrew studies. Unlike some other \\"thinkers\\" of this time, Reuchlin submerged himself into this, even creating a guide to preaching within the Hebrew faith. The book, titled De Arte Predicandi (1503), is possibly one of his best-known works from this period.\\r\\nAlbrecht Drer was at the time, and remains, the most famous artist of the German Renaissance. He was famous across Europe, and greatly admired in Italy, where his work was mainly known through his prints. He successfully integrated an elaborate Northern style with Renaissance harmony and monumentality. Among his best known works are Melencolia I, the Four Horsemen from his woodcut Apocalypse series, and Death, the Knight, and the Devil. Other significant artists were Lucas Cranach the Elder, the Danube School and the Little Masters.\\r\\nMartin Luther[11] initiated the Protestant Reformation through the criticisms of church practices such as selling indulgences, which he published in his Ninety-Five Theses of 1517. Luther also translated the Bible into German, making the Christian scriptures more accessible to the general population and inspiring the standardization of the German language.","input":"Who was the foremost artist of the german renaissance?"},{"output":"Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center","context":"This list of tallest buildings in Detroit ranks skyscrapers and high rises in the U.S. city of Detroit, Michigan by height. The tallest skyscraper in Detroit is the 73-story Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center, which rises 727 feet (222?m) along Detroit's International Riverfront.[A][1] It is the tallest building in the state of Michigan, the 97th-tallest building in the United States, and the second tallest hotel building in the Western Hemisphere.[1] Another famous skyscraper is One Detroit Center, which stands as the 2nd-tallest building in the city and the state.[2]\\r\\nDetroit's history of skyscrapers began in 1889, with completion of the historic 10-story Hammond Buildingconsidered the city's first steel-framed skyscraper.[3] The Qube in the Detroit Financial District now stands on this site.[4] Detroit witnessed a massive building boom during the Roaring Twenties, resulting in the construction of many of the city's ornate skyscrapers, including the Penobscot, Guardian, Fisher, Buhl, Stott, and Broderick. One Woodward Avenue, which rises 430 feet (131?m), was the tallest building constructed in the city during the 1960s. Detroit is the site of eight skyscrapers at least 492 feet (150?m) in height and twenty-seven at least 327 feet (100?m) in height.[5] Overall, the skyline of Detroit is ranked (based upon existing and under construction buildings over 492 feet (150?m)) third in the Midwestern United States (after Chicago and Minneapolis) and sixteenth in the United States, after New York City, Chicago, Miami, Houston, Los Angeles, Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco, Boston, Las Vegas, Seattle, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Jersey City, and Minneapolis.[B]\\r\\nThe most recently constructed skyscrapers in the city are One Detroit Center, completed in 1993, and the Greektown Casino Hotel, completed in 2009.

Bamford Excavators Limited, universally known as JCB, is a British multinational corporation, with headquarters in Rocester, Staffordshire, manufacturing equipment for construction, agriculture, waste handling and demolition. It is the world's third-largest construction equipment manufacturer.[3] It produces over 300 types of machine, including diggers (backhoes), excavators, tractors and diesel engines. It has 22 factories across Asia, Europe, North America, and South America; its products are sold in over 150 countries.[2][4]\\r\\nJCB was founded in 1945 by Joseph Cyril Bamford, after whom it is named; it continues to be owned by the Bamford family. In the UK and India, 'JCB' is often used colloquially as a generic description for mechanical diggers and excavators and now appears in the Oxford English Dictionary, although it is still held as a trademark.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJCB was founded by Joseph Cyril Bamford in October 1945 in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, England. He rented a lock-up garage 3.7 by 4.6?m (12 by 15?ft). In it, using a welding set which he bought second-hand for S1 from English Electric, he made his first vehicle, a tipping trailer from war-surplus materials. The trailer's sides and floor were made from steel sheet that had been part of air-raid shelters. On the same day as his son Anthony was born, he sold the trailer at a nearby market for S45 (plus a part-exchanged farm cart) and at once made another trailer.[citation needed] At one time he made vehicles in Eckersley's coal yard in Uttoxeter. The first trailer and the welding set have been preserved.\\r\\nIn 1948, six people were working for the company, and it made the first hydraulic tipping trailer in Europe. In 1950, it moved to an old cheese factory in Rocester, still employing six. A year later, he began painting his products yellow. In 1953, his first backhoe loader was launched, and the JCB logo appeared for the first time. It was designed by Derby Media and advertising designer Leslie Smith. In 1957, the firm launched the \\"hydra-digga\\", incorporating the excavator and the major loader as a single all-purpose tool useful for the agricultural and construction industries.[6]\\r\\nIn 1960, JCB's hydraulic tractors entered the North American market, proving a long-lasting success. JCB became, and still is, the brand leader in the world. By 1964, JCB had sold over 3,000 3C backhoe loaders. The next year, the first 360-degree excavator was introduced, the JCB 7.[7]\\r\\nIn 1978, the Loadall machine was introduced. The next year, JCB started its operation in India. In 1991, the firm entered a joint venture with Sumitomo of Japan to produce excavators, which ended in 1998.[8] Two years later, a JCB factory was completed in Pooler near Savannah, Georgia in the USA, and the next year a factory was opened in Brazil.\\r\\nProduction of the first engine designed and manufactured by JCB, the JCB444 diesel engine, started in 2004.[9] In 2005, for the first time in nearly forty years, JCB bought a company, purchasing the German equipment firm Vibromax. In the same year, the firm opened a new factory in Pudong, China. By 2006, the firm had 4000 employees, twice what it had in 1975.\\r\\nPlanning of a new S40 million pound JCB Heavy Products site began following the launch of an architectural design competition in 2007 managed by RIBA Competitions,[10] and by the next year, the firm began to move from its old site in Pinfold Street in Uttoxeter to the new site beside the A50; the Pinfold Street site was demolished in 2009. During that year, JCB announced plans to make India its largest manufacturing hub. Its factory at Ballabgarh in Haryana, was to become the worlds largest backhoe loader manufacturing facility.[11]\\r\\nJCB shed 2,000 jobs during the recession, but in 2010 it announced it was recruiting up to 200 new workers.[12]\\r\\nThe company was a member of the CBI business lobby group until 2016. In October 2016, it was reported that JCB had left the CBI in the summer of 2016 following the Brexit vote.[13] JCB has also been a significant donor to the UK Conservative Party; since 2007 JCB and related Bamford entities have given the party S8.1m in cash or kind.[14] JCB chairman Anthony Bamford donated S100,000 to Vote Leave, the official pro-Brexit group.[13]\\r\\nJCB has 18 factories in the UK, Germany, North and South America, Australia, India, and China.[4] The company employs some 12,000 people on four continents and sells its products in 150 countries through 1500 dealer depot locations. The company has a range of more than 300 products.[15]\\r\\nJCB is headquartered in Rocester, United Kingdom, which is also the production site for backhoe loaders and telescopic 'Loadall' handlers. It has a further three factories in nearby Cheadle, Staffordshire (JCB Earthmovers, JCB Landpower and JCB Compact Products), one in Rugeley (JCB Cab Systems), three in Uttoxeter (JCB Attachments, JCB Heavy Products and JCB World Parts Centre), one in Foston in Derbyshire (JCB Power Systems) and one in Wrexham in North Wales (JCB Drivetrain Systems). In July 2013 the company opened a dedicated logistics hub in Newcastle-Under-Lyme.[16] This facility is the central hub for component distribution to production facilities, as distinct from the World Parts Centre in Uttoxeter which distributes spare parts to dealers and customers.\\r\\nIn December 2013 it was announced that the Rugeley Cab Systems plant would move to a new facility in Uttoxeter which would allow the in-sourcing of cab assembly currently contracted to third parties. This investment is to be accompanied by the expansion of the Rocester and Cheadle production sites by 2018.[17]\\r\\nIts Indian factories are based in Faridabad (Haryana), Jaipur[18] and Pune, its US factory is in Pooler, Georgia, its Brazilian factory in Sorocaba, and its Chinese factory was completed in 2005 in Pudong near Shanghai. JCB also owns Vibromax, a German compaction equipment company based in Gatersleben.\\r\\nJCB has also licensed its name and image to a line of consumer power tools, manufactured by Alba PLC.\\r\\nThe products are sold through franchised dealerships, many of which are often exclusive and cover whole countries.[19]\\r\\nJCB dominates the Indian construction equipment market with every three out of every four construction equipment sold in India being a JCB. JCB India's revenue rose more than 12 times to $1 billion in 2012-13 from $75 million in 2001. The Indian operations of the UK company account for 17.5% of its total revenue.[20]\\r\\nMany of the vehicles produced by JCB are variants of the backhoe loader, including tracked or wheeled variants, mini and large versions and other variations for carrying and moving items, for example fork lift vehicles and telescopic handlers for moving materials to the upper floors of a building site. Wheeled loading shovels and articulated dump trucks are also produced.\\r\\nTracked 360 excavators ranging from the JZ70 (7 tonne zero tail swing excavator) to the JS460 (46 tonne tracked excavator). In 2008 at Con expo JCB revealed a new top range JS520 which included the new style paintjob with rams painted black.\\r\\nWheeled 360 excavators ranging from the JS130W to the JS200W.\\r\\nMachines can be produced with either monoboom or a triple articulated boom.\\r\\nIndustrial and agricultural wheeled loaders from compact 6 tonne hydrostatic machines to larger 25 tonne quarrying machines using a mix of 4 and 6 cylinder diesel engines.\\r\\nJCB has also made its name in the tractor world by producing one of the first such machines that features proper suspension and is capable of travelling at speed on roads. The JCB Fastrac entered production in 1990. Prior to this design, the suspension was difficult because of the fixed-height connections required to farm machinery, and tractors were notoriously slow on the roads. Dependent on the model, the Fastrac can travel at 50?km/h, 65?km/h or 75?km/h (40?mph). At launch the Fastrac was featured on the BBC television programme Tomorrow's World, and years later as Jeremy Clarkson's tractor of choice in Top Gear. From 2006 the company also produces a range of compact tractors designed for grounds-care, horticultural, and light agricultural duties.\\r\\nJCB also makes a range of military vehicles, which also concentrate on load-handling and excavation.[21] These include the JCB HMEE.\\r\\nIn April 2006, JCB announced that they were developing a Diesel-powered Land Speed Record vehicle known as the 'JCB Dieselmax'. The car is powered by two modified JCB 444 diesel powerplants using a two-stage turbocharger to generate 750?bhp, one engine driving the front wheels and the other the rear wheels.\\r\\nOn 22 August 2006 the Dieselmax, driven by Andy Green broke the diesel engine land speed record, attaining a speed of 328.767?mph (529?km/h). The following day, the record was again broken, this time with a speed of 350.092?mph (563.418?km/h).\\r\\nJCB acquired the German company Vibromax, which manufactures compaction equipment.\\r\\nJCB licenses its brand for a series of rugged feature phones and smartphones targeted at construction personnel. The design and marketing contract was awarded to Data Select in 2010.[22]\\r\\nThe JCB logo dates from 1953; from 1960 the company typewriters were given an extra key to render it accurately. The company has mainly advertised in the trade publications and their advertisements have won many awards[examples needed], particularly for photography. The logo was designed by Leslie Smith, and is off-set at 18 degrees from the horizontal and 22 degrees from the vertical ÿ the angles Joe Bamford liked.[citation needed]\\r\\nTo demonstrate his faith in the hydraulic fail safes on JCB machines (which lock the arms in the event of a loss of hydraulic pressure, preventing them from crashing to the ground), Joe Cyril Bamford arranged to have several backhoes raise themselves up on their arms, and drove his car beneath them.[citation needed]\\r\\nThis has since developed into a world-famous demonstration of the versatility of the backhoe configuration. The JCB display team (JCB Dancing Diggers) tour agricultural shows and produce videos, showing some of the unusual ways in which such vehicles can support themselves or manoeuvre. For example, it is quite common for drivers to support the vehicle on both buckets, either for turning on the spot without damaging ground, or for spinning the tracks in a puddle to clean them. The display team expanded this concept into a sort of vehicle gymnastics. The drivers are members of JCB's demonstration team, who visit prospective customers and demonstrate machines on the customer's property in order to prove the machine's suitability for the task at hand.[citation needed]\\r\\nJCB Insurance Services was founded in 1984 by JCB Chairman Sir Anthony Bamford as a fully owned subsidiary of to provide for the insurance needs of the customers purchasing the firm's equipment, with the funding they obtained from another fully owned subsidiary, JCB Finance. The insurance subsidiary provides all-risks policies, with optional additions for road risks coverage, and for Public liability and employers liability.[23] [24]\\r\\nJCB is the sponsor of JCB Academy, a new secondary school in Rocester which had its first intake of pupils in September 2010.[25]\\r\\nJCB Research is described as an obscure company worth S27,000 which donated S2m to the Conservative party making it the largest donor in the run up to the 2010 election. Ownership of the company which has never filed accounts is disputed by the Bamford brothers. According to the Guardian, much of the Bamford money was held in shares in offshore trusts.[26]","input":"What is the meaning of j c b?"},{"output":"The first book of Samuel","context":"David[a] is described in the Hebrew Bible as the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah.\\r\\nIn the biblical narrative, David is a young shepherd who first gains fame as a musician and later by killing Goliath. He becomes a favorite of King Saul and a close friend of Saul's son Jonathan. Worried that David is trying to take his throne, Saul turns on David. After Saul and Jonathan are killed in battle, David is anointed as King. David conquers Jerusalem, taking the Ark of the Covenant into the city, and establishing the kingdom founded by Saul. As king, David arranges the death of Uriah the Hittite to cover his adultery with Bathsheba. According to the same biblical text, God denies David the opportunity to build the temple and his son, Absalom, tries to overthrow him. David flees Jerusalem during Absalom's rebellion, but after Absalom's death he returns to the city to rule Israel. Before his peaceful death, he chooses his son Solomon as his successor. He is mentioned in the prophetic literature as an ideal king and an ancestor of a future Messiah, and many psalms are ascribed to him.\\r\\nHistorians of the Ancient Near East agree that David probably existed around 1000 BCE, but that there is little that can be said about him as a historical figure. There is no direct evidence outside of the Bible concerning David, but the Tel Dan Stele, an inscribed stone erected by a king of Damascus in the late 9th/early 8th centuries BCE to commemorate his victory over two enemy kings, contains the phrase ???????, bytdwd, which most scholars translate as \\"House of David\\". Ancient Near East historians generally doubt that the united monarchy as described in the Bible existed.\\r\\nDavid is richly represented in post-biblical Jewish written and oral tradition, and is discussed in the New Testament. Early Christians interpreted the life of Jesus in light of the references to the Messiah and to David; Jesus is described as being descended from David. David is discussed in the Quran and figures in Islamic oral and written tradition as well. The biblical character of David has inspired many interpretations in fictional literature over centuries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first book of Samuel portrays David as the youngest of the eight sons of Jesse of Bethlehem. His mother is not named in any book of the Bible, but the Talmud identifies her as Nitzevet daughter of Adael.[2] When the story was retold in 1 Chronicles (4th century BCE) he was made the youngest of seven sons and given two sisters, Zeruiah and Abigail. The Book of Ruth (possibly also 4th century BCE) traces his ancestry back to Ruth the Moabite.\\r\\nDavid is described as cementing his relations with various political and national groups through marriage.[3] He is described as having eight wives: Michal, the second daughter of King Saul; Ahinoam the Jezreelite; Abigail the Carmelite, previously wife of Nabal; Maachah, daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur; Haggith; Abital; Eglah; and Bathsheba.\\r\\nThe Book of Chronicles lists his sons with his various wives and concubines. In Hebron, David had six sons: Amnon, by Ahinoam; Daniel, by Abigail; Absalom, by Maachah; Adonijah, by Haggith; Shephatiah, by Abital; and Ithream, by Eglah.[4] By Bathsheba, his sons were Shammua, Shobab, Nathan and Solomon. David's sons born in Jerusalem of his other wives included Ibhar, Elishua, Eliphelet, Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, Elishama and Eliada.[5] Jerimoth, who is not mentioned in any of the genealogies, is mentioned as another of his sons in 2 Chronicles 11:18. His daughter Tamar, by Maachah, is a key character in the incident of her rape by one of her half-brothers.\\r\\n\\r\\nGod is angered when Saul, Israel's king, unlawfully offers a sacrifice[6] and later disobeys a divine instruction to not only kill all of the Amalekites, but to destroy also their confiscated property.[7] Consequently, he sends the prophet Samuel to anoint a shepherd, David, the youngest son of Jesse of Bethlehem, to be king instead.[8]\\r\\n God sends an evil spirit to torment Saul. Saul's courtiers recommend that he send for David, a man skillful on the lyre, wise in speech, and brave in battle. So David enters Saul's service as one of the royal armour-bearers, and plays the lyre to soothe the king.[9]\\r\\n War comes between Israel and the Philistines, and the giant Goliath challenges the Israelites to send out a champion to face him in single combat.[10] David, sent by his father to bring provisions to his brothers serving in Saul's army, declares that he can defeat Goliath.[11] Refusing the king's offer of the royal armour,[12] he kills Goliath with his sling.[13] Saul inquires the name of the young hero's father.[14]\\r\\nSaul sets David over his army. All Israel loves David, but his popularity causes Saul to fear him (\\"What else can he wish but the kingdom?\\").[15] Saul plots his death, but Saul's son Jonathan, one of those who loves David, warns him of his father's schemes and David flees. He goes first to Nob, where he is fed by the priest Ahimelech and given Goliath's sword, and then to Gath, the Philistine city of Goliath, intending to seek refuge with King Achish there. Achish's servants or officials question his loyalty, and David sees that he is in danger there.[16] He goes next to the cave of Adullam, where his family join him.[17] From there he goes to seek refuge with the king of Moab, but the prophet Gad advises him to leave and he goes to the Forest of Hereth,[18] and then to Keilah, where he is involved in a further battle with the Philistines. Saul plans to besiege Keilah so that he can capture David, so David leaves the city in order to protect its inhabitants.[19] From there he takes refuge in the mountainous Wilderness of Ziph.[20]\\r\\n Jonathan meets with David again and confirms his loyalty to David as the future king. The people of Ziph notify Saul that David is taking refuge in their territory, Saul seeks confirmation and plans to capture David in the Wilderness of Maon, but his attention is diverted by a renewed Philistine invasion and David is able to secure some respite at Ein Gedi.[21] Returning from battle with the Philistines, Saul heads to Ein Gedi in pursuit of David and enters the cave where, as it happens, David and his supporters are hiding, \\"to attend to his needs\\". David realises he has an opportunity to kill Saul, but this is not his intention: he secretly cuts off a corner of Saul's robe and when Saul has left the cave he comes out to pay homage to Saul as the king and to demonstrate, using the piece of robe, that he holds no malice towards Saul. The two are thus reconciled and Saul recognises David as his successor.[22]\\r\\nAlternatively, or (in the opinion of some commentators) subsequently,[23] Saul and David were reconciled following a similar occurrence when David was able to infiltrate Saul's camp on the hill of Hachilah and remove his spear and a jug of water from his side while he and his guards lay asleep. In this account (1 Samuel 26), David is advised by Abishai that this is his opportunity to kill Saul, but David declines, saying he will not \\"stretch out [his] hand against the Lords anointed\\".[24] David shows, by removing Saul's spear, that he had chance to take Saul's life but did not do so. Saul confesses that he has been wrong to pursue David, blesses him and promises that he \\"will do great things and surely triumph\\".[25] David prays that his own protection will be like his protection of Saul. The New King James Version and the New International Version both identify this episode as a second reconciliation between Saul and David[26] (with no account of any intervening dispute) but theologian Albert Barnes says the incident \\"is of a nature unlikely to have occurred more than once\\". This, it seems, was their last interview; after this they saw each other no more.[27]\\r\\nA different tradition is recalled in 1 Samuel 27:1ÿ4, namely that Saul ceased to pursue David because David took refuge a second time with Achish, the Philistine king of Gath.[28] Robert Jamieson, in the Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary, suggests that Saul and David had \\"become irreconcilable\\" despite the reconciliations described in 1 Samuel 24 and 1 Samuel 26.[29] Achish permits David to reside in Ziklag, close to the border between Gath and Judea, from where he leads raids against the Geshurites, the Girzites and the Amalekites, but leads Achish to believe he is attacking the Israelites in Judah, the Jerahmeelites and the Kenites. Achish believes that David had become a loyal vassal, but he never wins the trust of the princes or lords of Gath and at their request Achish instructs David to remain behind to guard the camp when the Philistines march against Saul.[30] David returns to Ziklag.[31] Jonathan and Saul are killed in battle,[32] and David is anointed king over Judah.[33] In the north, Saul's son Ish-Bosheth is anointed king of Israel, and war ensues until Ish-Bosheth is murdered.[34]\\r\\n With the death of Saul's son, the elders of Israel come to Hebron and David is anointed king over all of Israel.[35] He conquers Jerusalem, previously a Jebusite stronghold, and makes it his capital.[36] He brings the Ark of the Covenant to the city,[37] intending to build a temple for God, but the prophet Nathan forbids it, prophesying that the temple would be built by one of his sons.[38] Nathan also prophesies that God has made a covenant with the house of David stating, \\"your throne shall be established forever\\".[39] David wins additional victories over the Philistines, Moabites, Edomites, Amalekites, Ammonites and king Hadadezer of Aram-Zobah, after which they become tributaries.[40]\\r\\n During a siege against the Ammonite capital of Rabbah, David remains in Jerusalem. He spies a woman, Bathsheba, bathing on a nearby rooftop and summons her; she becomes pregnant.[41][42][43] The text in the Bible does not explicitly state whether Bathsheba consented or not for sex.[44][45][46] David calls her husband, Uriah the Hittite, back from the battle to rest, hoping that he will go home to his wife and the child will be presumed to be his. Uriah does not visit his wife, however, so David conspires to have him killed in the heat of battle. David then marries the widowed Bathsheba.[47] In response, Nathan prophesies the punishment that will fall upon him, stating \\"the sword shall never depart from your house.\\"[48] When David acknowledges that he has sinned,[49] Nathan advises him that his sin is forgiven and he will not die,[50] but the child will.[51]\\r\\n In fulfillment of Nathan's words, David's son Absalom rebels.[52] Absalom's forces are routed at the battle of the Wood of Ephraim, and he is caught by his long hair in the branches of a tree where, contrary to David's order, he is killed by Joab, the commander of David's army.[53] David laments the death of his favourite son: \\"O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!\\"[54] until Joab persuades him to recover from \\"the extravagance of his grief\\"[55] and to fulfil his duty to his people.[56] David returns to Gilgal and is escorted across the River Jordan and back to Jerusalem by the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.[57]\\r\\n When David is old and bedridden, Adonijah, his eldest surviving son and natural heir, declares himself king.[58] Bathsheba and Nathan go to David and obtain his agreement to crown Bathsheba's son Solomon as king, according to David's earlier promise, and the revolt of Adonijah is put down.[59] David dies at the age of 70 after reigning for 40 years,[60] and on his deathbed counsels Solomon to walk in the ways of God and to take revenge on his enemies.[61]\\r\\nThe Book of Samuel calls David a skillful harp (lyre) player[62] and \\"the sweet psalmist of Israel.\\"[63] Yet, while almost half of the Psalms are headed \\"A Psalm of David\\" (also translated as \\"to David\\" or \\"for David\\") and tradition identifies several with specific events in Davids life (e.g., Psalms 3, 7, 18, 34, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 63 and 142),[64] the headings are late additions and no psalm can be attributed to David with certainty.[65]\\r\\nPsalm 34 is attributed to David on the occasion of his escape from Abimelech (or King Achish) by pretending to be insane.[66] According to the parallel narrative in 1 Samuel 21, instead of killing the man who had exacted so many casualties from him, Abimelech allows David to depart, exclaiming, \\"Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?\\"[67]\\r\\nThe Tel Dan Stele, an inscribed stone erected by a king of Damascus in the late 9th/early 8th centuries BCE to commemorate his victory over two enemy kings, contains the phrase ???????, bytdwd, which most scholars translate as \\"House of David\\".[68] Other scholars, such as Anson Rainey have challenged this reading,[69][70] but it is likely that this is a reference to a dynasty of the Kingdom of Judah which traced its ancestry to a founder named David.[68] The Mesha Stele from Moab, dating from approximately the same period, may also contain the name David in two places, although this is less certain than the mention in the Tel Dan inscription.[71]\\r\\nApart from these, all that is known of David comes from the biblical literature. The Books of Samuel were substantially composed during the time of King Josiah at the end of the 7th century BCE, extended during the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE), and substantially complete by about 550 BCE, although further editing was done even after thenthe silver quarter-shekel which Saul's servant offers to Samuel in 1 Samuel 9 \\"almost certainly fixes the date of the story in the Persian or Hellenistic period\\".[72] The authors and editors of Samuel drew on many earlier sources, including, for their history of David, the \\"history of David's rise\\" (1 Samuel 16:14ÿ2 Samuel 5:10), and the \\"succession narrative\\" (2 Samuel 9ÿ20 and 1 Kings 1ÿ2).[73] The Book of Chronicles, which tells the story from a different point of view, was probably composed in the period 350ÿ300 BCE, and uses Samuel as its source.[74]\\r\\nThe authors and editors of Samuel and Chronicles did not aim to record history, but to promote David's reign as inevitable and desirable, and for this reason there is little about David that is concrete and undisputed.[75] The archaeological evidence indicates that in the 10th century BCE, the time of David, Judah was sparsely inhabited and Jerusalem was no more than a small village; over the following century it slowly evolved from a highland chiefdom to a kingdom, but always overshadowed by the older and more powerful kingdom of Israel to the north.[76] The biblical evidence likewise indicates that David's Judah was something less than a full-fledged monarchy: it often calls him negid, for example, meaning \\"prince\\" or \\"chief\\", rather than melek, meaning \\"king\\"; the biblical David sets up none of the complex bureaucracy that a kingdom needs (even his army is made up of volunteers), and his followers are largely related to him and from his small home-area around Hebron.[77]\\r\\nBeyond this, the full range of possible interpretations is available. The late John Bright, in his History of Israel (1981), takes Samuel at face value. Donald B. Redford, however, sees all reconstructions from biblical sources for the United Monarchy period as examples of \\"academic wishful thinking\\".[78] Thomas L. Thompson rejects the historicity of the biblical narrative: \\"The history of Palestine and of its peoples is very different from the Bible's narratives, whatever political claims to the contrary may be. An independent history of Judea during the Iron I and Iron II periods has little room for historicizing readings of the stories of I-II Samuel and I Kings.\\"[79] Amihai Mazar however, concludes that based on recent archeological findings, like those in City of David, Khirbet Qeiyafa, Tel Dan, Tel Rehov, Khirbet en-Nahas and others \\"the deconstruction of United Monarchy and the devaluation of Judah as a state in 9th century is unacceptable interpretation of available historic data\\". According to Mazar, based on archeological evidences, the United Monarchy can be described as a \\"state in development\\".[80]\\r\\nSome studies of David have been written: Baruch Halpern has pictured David as a lifelong vassal of Achish, the Philistine king of Gath;[81] Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman have identified as the oldest and most reliable section of Samuel those chapters which describe David as the charismatic leader of a band of outlaws who captures Jerusalem and makes it his capital.[82] Steven McKenzie, Associate Professor of the Hebrew Bible at Rhodes College and author of King David: A Biography, states the belief that David actually came from a wealthy family, was \\"ambitious and ruthless\\" and a tyrant who murdered his opponents, including his own sons.[65]\\r\\nCritical Bible scholarship holds that the biblical account of David's rise to power is a political apologyan answer to contemporary charges against him, of his involvement in murders and regicide.[83]\\r\\nIsrael Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman reject the idea that David ruled over a united monarchy, suggesting instead that he ruled only as a chieftain over the southern kingdom of Judah, much smaller than the northern kingdom of Israel at that time.[84] They posit that Israel and Judah were still polytheistic in the time of David and Solomon, and that much later seventh-century redactors sought to portray a past golden age of a united, monotheistic monarchy in order to serve contemporary needs.[85] They note a lack of archeological evidence for David's military campaigns and a relative underdevelopment of Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, compared to a more developed and urbanized Samaria, capital of Israel.[86][87][88]\\r\\nJacob L. Wright, Associate Professor of Hebrew Bible at Emory University, has written that the most popular legends about David, including his killing of Goliath, his affair with Bathsheba, and his ruling of a United Kingdom of Israel rather than just Judah, are the creation of those who lived generations after him, in particular those living in the late Persian or Hellenistic periods.[89]\\r\\nDavid is an important figure in Rabbinic Judaism. Many legends have grown around the figure of David. According to one Rabbinic tradition, David was raised as the son of his father Jesse and spent his early years herding his father's sheep in the wilderness while his brothers were in school.\\r\\nDavid's adultery with Bathsheba was only an opportunity to demonstrate the power of repentance, and the Talmud states that it was not adultery at all, quoting a Jewish practice of divorce on the eve of battle. Furthermore, according to Talmudic sources, the death of Uriah was not to be considered murder, on the basis that Uriah had committed a capital offense by refusing to obey a direct command from the King.[90] However, in tractate Sanhedrin, David expressed remorse over his transgressions and sought forgiveness. God ultimately forgave David and Bathsheba but would not remove their sins from Scripture.[91]\\r\\nAccording to midrashim, Adam gave up 70 years of his life for the life of David.[92] Also, according to the Talmud Yerushalmi, David was born and died on the Jewish holiday of Shavuot (Feast of Weeks). His piety was said to be so great that his prayers could bring down things from Heaven.\\r\\nThe concept of the Messiah is important in Christianity. Originally an earthly king ruling by divine appointment (\\"the anointed one\\", as the title Messiah had it), the \\"son of David\\" became in the last two pre-Christian centuries the apocalyptic and heavenly one who would deliver Israel and usher in a new kingdom. This was the background to the concept of Messiahship in early Christianity, which interpreted the career of Jesus \\"by means of the titles and functions assigned to David in the mysticism of the Zion cult, in which he served as priest-king and in which he was the mediator between God and man\\".[93] The early Church believed that \\"the life of David [foreshadowed] the life of Christ; Bethlehem is the birthplace of both; the shepherd life of David points out Christ, the Good Shepherd; the five stones chosen to slay Goliath are typical of the five wounds; the betrayal by his trusted counsellor, Achitophel, and the passage over the Cedron remind us of Christ's Sacred Passion. Many of the Davidic Psalms, as we learn from the New Testament, are clearly typical of the future Messiah.\\"[94] In the Middle Ages, \\"Charlemagne thought of himself, and was viewed by his court scholars, as a 'new David'. [This was] not in itself a new idea, but [one whose] content and significance were greatly enlarged by him\\".[95] The linking of David to earthly kingship was reflected in later Medieval cathedral windows all over Europe through the device of the Tree of Jesse, its branches demonstrating how divine kingship descended from Jesse, through his son David, to Jesus.\\r\\nWestern Rite churches (Lutheran, Roman Catholic) celebrate his feast day on 29 December, Eastern-rite on 19 December.[96] The Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches celebrate the feast day of the \\"Holy Righteous Prophet and King David\\" on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers (two Sundays before the Great Feast of the Nativity of the Lord), when he is commemorated together with other ancestors of Jesus. He is also commemorated on the Sunday after the Nativity, together with Joseph and James, the Brother of the Lord.\\r\\nIn European Christian culture of the Middle Ages, David was made a member of the Nine Worthies, a group of heroes encapsulating all the ideal qualities of chivalry. His life was thus proposed as a valuable subject for study by those aspiring to chivalric status. This aspect of David in the Nine Worthies was popularised firstly through literature, and was thereafter adopted as a frequent subject for painters and sculptors.\\r\\nDavid was considered as a model ruler and a symbol of divinely-ordained monarchy throughout medieval Western Europe and Eastern Christendom. David was perceived as the biblical predecessor to Christian Roman and Byzantine emperors and the name \\"New David\\" was used as an honorific reference to these rulers.[98] The Georgian Bagratids and the Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia claimed a direct biological descent from him.[99] Likewise, the Frankish Carolingian dynasty frequently connected themselves to David; Charlemagne himself occasionally used the name of David as his pseudonym.[98]\\r\\nDavid (Arabic ????, Dwd) is a highly important figure in Islam as one of the major prophets sent by God to guide the Israelites. David is mentioned several times in the Quran, often with his son Solomon. The actual Arabic equivalent to the Hebrew Davؐd is Dawd. In the Qur'an: David killed Goliath (2:251), a giant soldier in the Philistine army. When David killed Goliath, God granted him kingship and wisdom and enforced it (38:20). David was made God's \\"vicegerent on earth\\" (38:26) and God further gave David sound judgment (21:78; 37:21ÿ24, 26) as well as the Psalms, regarded as books of divine wisdom (4:163; 17:55). The birds and mountains united with David in uttering praise to God (21:79; 34:10; 38:18), while God made iron soft for David (34:10), God also instructed David in the art of fashioning chain-mail out of iron (21:80); an indication of the first use of Wrought iron, this knowledge gave David a major advantage over his bronze and cast iron-armed opponents, not to mention the cultural and economic impact. Together with Solomon, David gave judgment in a case of damage to the fields (21:78) and David judged the matter between two disputants in his prayer chamber (38:21ÿ23). Since there is no mention in the Qur'an of the wrong David did to Uriah nor any reference to Bathsheba, Muslims reject this narrative.[100]\\r\\nMuslim tradition and the hadith stress David's zeal in daily prayer as well as in fasting.[101] Qur'an commentators, historians and compilers of the numerous Stories of the Prophets elaborate upon David's concise Qur'anic narratives and specifically mention David's gift in singing his Psalms as well as his musical and vocal talents. His voice is described as having had a captivating power, weaving its influence not only over man but over all beasts and nature, who would unite with him to praise God.[102]\\r\\nLiterary works about David include:\\r\\nDavid has been depicted several times in films; these are some of the best-known:\\r\\nFor a considerable period, starting in the 15th century and continuing until the 19th, French playing card manufacturers assigned to each of the court cards names taken from history or mythology. In this context, the King of Spades was often known as \\"David\\".[113][114]\\r\\nStudy of King David, by Julia Margaret Cameron.

The well water is drawn by a pump, or using containers, such as buckets, that are raised mechanically or by hand. Wells were first constructed at least eight thousand years ago and historically vary in construction from a simple scoop in the sediment of a dry watercourse to the stepwells of India, the qanats of Iran, and the shadoofs and sakiehs of India. Placing a lining in the well shaft helps create stability and linings of wood or wickerwork date back at least as far as the Iron Age.\\r\\nWells have been traditionally sunk by hand digging as is the case in rural developing areas. These wells are inexpensive and low-tech as they use mostly manual labour and the structure can be lined with brick or stone as the excavation proceeds. A more modern method called caissoning uses pre-cast reinforced concrete well rings that are lowered into the hole. Driven wells can be created in unconsolidated material with a well hole structure, which consists of a hardened drive point and a screen of perforated pipe, after which a pump is installed to collect the water. Deeper wells can be excavated by hand drilling methods or machine drilling, using a bit in a borehole. Drilled wells are usually cased with a factory-made pipe composed of steel or plastic. Drilled wells can access water at much greater depths than dug wells.\\r\\nTwo broad classes of well are shallow or unconfined wells completed within the uppermost saturated aquifer at that location, and deep or confined wells, sunk through an impermeable stratum into an aquifer beneath. A collector well can be constructed adjacent to a freshwater lake or stream with water percolating through the intervening material. The site of a well can be selected by a hydrogeologist, or groundwater surveyor. Water may be pumped or hand drawn. Impurities from the surface can easily reach shallow sources and contamination of the supply by pathogens or chemical contaminants needs to be avoided. Well water typically contains more minerals in solution than surface water and may require treatment before being potable. Soil salination can occur as the water table falls and the surrounding soil begins to dry out. Another environmental problem is the potential for methane to seep into the water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWood-lined wells are known from the early Neolithic Linear Pottery culture, for example in Kckhoven (an outlying centre of Erkelenz), dated 5090?BC and Eythra, dated 5200?BC in Schletz (an outlying centre of Asparn an der Zaya) in Austria.[1]\\r\\nSome of the earliest evidence of water wells are located in China. The neolithic Chinese discovered and made extensive use of deep drilled groundwater for drinking. The Chinese text The Book of Changes, originally a divination text of the Western Zhou dynasty (1046 -771 BC), contains an entry describing how the ancient Chinese maintained their wells and protected their sources of water.[2] Archaeological evidence and old Chinese documents reveal that the prehistoric and ancient Chinese had the aptitude and skills for digging deep water wells for drinking water as early as 6000 to 7000 years ago. A well excavated at the Hemedu excavation site was believed to have been built during the neolithic era.[3] The well was cased by four rows of logs with a square frame attached to them at the top of the well. 60 additional tile wells southwest of Beijing are also believed to have been built around 600 BC for drinking and irrigation.[4][5]\\r\\nIn Egypt, shadoofs and sakiehs are used.[6][7] When compared to each other however, the Sakkieh is much more efficient, as it can bring up water from a depth of 10 metres (versus the 3 metres of the shadoof). The Sakieh is the Egyptian version of the Noria. Some of the world's oldest known wells, located in Cyprus, date to 7000-8500 BC.[8] Two wells from the Neolithic period, around 6500 BC, have been discovered in Israel. One is in Atlit, on the northern coast of Israel, and the other is the Jezreel Valley.[9]\\r\\nUntil recent centuries, all artificial wells were pumpless hand-dug wells of varying degrees of sophistication, and they remain a very important source of potable water in some rural developing areas where they are routinely dug and used today. Their indispensability has produced a number of literary references, literal and figurative, to them, including the reference to the incident of Jesus meeting a woman at Jacob's well (John 4:6) in the bible and the \\"Ding Dong Bell\\" nursery rhyme about a cat in a well.\\r\\nHand-dug wells are excavations with diameters large enough to accommodate one or more people with shovels digging down to below the water table. The excavation is braced horizontally to avoid landslide or erosion endangering the people digging. They can be lined with laid stones or brick; extending this lining upwards above the ground surface to form a wall around the well serves to reduce both contamination and injuries by falling into the well. A more modern method called caissoning uses reinforced concrete or plain concrete pre-cast well rings that are lowered into the hole. A well-digging team digs under a cutting ring and the well column slowly sinks into the aquifer, whilst protecting the team from collapse of the well bore.\\r\\nHand-dug wells are inexpensive and low tech (compared to drilling) as they use mostly manual labour to access groundwater in rural locations in developing countries. They may be built with a high degree of community participation, or by local entrepreneurs who specialize in hand-dug wells. They have been successfully excavated to 60 metres (200?ft). They have low operational and maintenance costs, in part because water can be extracted by hand bailing, without a pump. The water is often coming from an aquifer or groundwater, and can be easily deepened, which may be necessary if the ground water level drops, by telescoping the lining further down into the aquifer. The yield of existing hand dug wells may be improved by deepening or introducing vertical tunnels or perforated pipes.\\r\\nDrawbacks to hand-dug wells are numerous. It can be impractical to hand dig wells in areas where hard rock is present, and they can be time-consuming to dig and line even in favourable areas. Because they exploit shallow aquifers, the well may be susceptible to yield fluctuations and possible contamination from surface water, including sewage. Hand dug well construction generally requires the use of a well trained construction team, and the capital investment for equipment such as concrete ring moulds, heavy lifting equipment, well shaft formwork, motorized de-watering pumps, and fuel can be large for people in developing countries. Construction of hand dug wells can be dangerous due to collapse of the well bore, falling objects and asphyxiation, including from dewatering pump exhaust fumes.\\r\\nWoodingdean well, hand-dug between 1858 and 1862, is claimed to be the world's deepest hand-dug well at 392 metres (1,285?ft).[10] The Big Well in Greensburg, Kansas is billed as the world's largest hand-dug well, at 109 feet (33?m) deep and 32 feet (9.8?m) in diameter. However, the Well of Joseph in the Cairo Citadel at 280 feet (85?m) deep and the Pozzo di S. Patrizio (St. Patrick's Well) built in 1527 in Orvieto, Italy, at 61 metres (200?ft) deep by 13 metres (43?ft) wide[11] are both larger by volume.\\r\\nDriven wells may be very simply created in unconsolidated material with a well hole structure, which consists of a hardened drive point and a screen (perforated pipe). The point is simply hammered into the ground, usually with a tripod and driver, with pipe sections added as needed. A driver is a weighted pipe that slides over the pipe being driven and is repeatedly dropped on it. When groundwater is encountered, the well is washed of sediment and a pump installed.[12]\\r\\nDrilled wells are typically created using either top-head rotary style, table rotary, or cable tool drilling machines, all of which use drilling stems that are turned to create a cutting action in the formation, hence the term drilling.\\r\\nDrilled wells can be excavated by simple hand drilling methods (augering, sludging, jetting, driving, hand percussion) or machine drilling (rotary, percussion, down the hole hammer). Deeprock rotary drilling method is most common. Rotary can be used in 90% of formation types.\\r\\nDrilled wells can get water from a much deeper level than dug wells canoften down to several hundred metres.[13]\\r\\nDrilled wells with electric pumps are used throughout the world, typically in rural or sparsely populated areas, though many urban areas are supplied partly by municipal wells. Most shallow well drilling machines are mounted on large trucks, trailers, or tracked vehicle carriages. Water wells typically range from 3?to 18 metres (10ÿ60?ft) deep, but in some areas can go deeper than 900 metres (3,000?ft).[citation needed]\\r\\nRotary drilling machines use a segmented steel drilling string, typically made up of 6?m (20?ft) sections of galvanized steel tubing that are threaded together, with a bit or other drilling device at the bottom end. Some rotary drilling machines are designed to install (by driving or drilling) a steel casing into the well in conjunction with the drilling of the actual bore hole. Air and/or water is used as a circulation fluid to displace cuttings and cool bits during the drilling. Another form of rotary-style drilling, termed mud rotary, makes use of a specially made mud, or drilling fluid, which is constantly being altered during the drill so that it can consistently create enough hydraulic pressure to hold the side walls of the bore hole open, regardless of the presence of a casing in the well. Typically, boreholes drilled into solid rock are not cased until after the drilling process is completed, regardless of the machinery used.\\r\\nThe oldest form of drilling machinery is the cable tool, still used today. Specifically designed to raise and lower a bit into the bore hole, the spudding of the drill causes the bit to be raised and dropped onto the bottom of the hole, and the design of the cable causes the bit to twist at approximately ?1?4 revolution per drop, thereby creating a drilling action. Unlike rotary drilling, cable tool drilling requires the drilling action to be stopped so that the bore hole can be bailed or emptied of drilled cuttings.\\r\\nDrilled wells are usually cased with a factory-made pipe, typically steel (in air rotary or cable tool drilling) or plastic/PVC (in mud rotary wells, also present in wells drilled into solid rock). The casing is constructed by welding, either chemically or thermally, segments of casing together. If the casing is installed during the drilling, most drills will drive the casing into the ground as the bore hole advances, while some newer machines will actually allow for the casing to be rotated and drilled into the formation in a similar manner as the bit advancing just below. PVC or plastic is typically welded and then lowered into the drilled well, vertically stacked with their ends nested and either glued or splined together. The sections of casing are usually 6 metres (20?ft) or more in length, and 6 to 12?in (15 to 30?cm) in diameter, depending on the intended use of the well and local groundwater conditions.\\r\\nSurface contamination of wells in the United States is typically controlled by the use of a surface seal. A large hole is drilled to a predetermined depth or to a confining formation (clay or bedrock, for example), and then a smaller hole for the well is completed from that point forward. The well is typically cased from the surface down into the smaller hole with a casing that is the same diameter as that hole. The annular space between the large bore hole and the smaller casing is filled with bentonite clay, concrete, or other sealant material. This creates an impermeable seal from the surface to the next confining layer that keeps contaminants from traveling down the outer sidewalls of the casing or borehole and into the aquifer. In addition, wells are typically capped with either an engineered well cap or seal that vents air through a screen into the well, but keeps insects, small animals, and unauthorized persons from accessing the well.\\r\\nAt the bottom of wells, based on formation, a screening device, filter pack, slotted casing, or open bore hole is left to allow the flow of water into the well. Constructed screens are typically used in unconsolidated formations (sands, gravels, etc.), allowing water and a percentage of the formation to pass through the screen. Allowing some material to pass through creates a large area filter out of the rest of the formation, as the amount of material present to pass into the well slowly decreases and is removed from the well. Rock wells are typically cased with a PVC liner/casing and screen or slotted casing at the bottom, this is mostly present just to keep rocks from entering the pump assembly. Some wells utilize a filter pack method, where an undersized screen or slotted casing is placed inside the well and a filter medium is packed around the screen, between the screen and the borehole or casing. This allows the water to be filtered of unwanted materials before entering the well and pumping zone.\\r\\nAn automated water well system powered by a jet-pump.\\r\\nAn automated water well system powered by a submersible pump.\\r\\nA water well system with a cistern.\\r\\nA water well system with a pressurized cistern.\\r\\nA section of a stainless steel screen well.\\r\\nThere are two broad classes of drilled-well types, based on the type of aquifer the well is in:\\r\\nA special type of water well may be constructed adjacent to freshwater lakes or streams. Commonly called a collector well but sometimes referred to by the trade name Ranney well or Ranney collector, this type of well involves sinking a caisson vertically below the top of the aquifer and then advancing lateral collectors out of the caisson and beneath the surface water body. Pumping from within the caisson induces infiltration of water from the surface water body into the aquifer, where it is collected by the collector well laterals and conveyed into the caisson where it can be pumped to the ground surface.[citation needed]\\r\\nTwo additional broad classes of well types may be distinguished, based on the use of the well:\\r\\nA well constructed for pumping groundwater can be used passively as a monitoring well and a small diameter well can be pumped, but this distinction by use is common.[citation needed]\\r\\nBefore excavation, information about the geology, water table depth, seasonal fluctuations, recharge area and rate must be found. This work is typically done by a hydrogeologist, or a groundwater surveyor using a variety of tools including electro-seismic surveying,[14] any available information from nearby wells, geologic maps, and sometimes geophysical imaging.\\r\\nShallow pumping wells can often supply drinking water at a very low cost. However, impurities from the surface easily reach shallow sources, which leads to a greater risk of contamination for these wells compared to deeper wells. Contaminated wells can lead to the spread of various waterborne diseases. Dug and driven wells are relatively easy to contaminate; for instance, most dug wells are unreliable in the majority of the United States.[15]\\r\\nMost of the bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi that contaminate well water comes from fecal material from humans and other animals, for example from on-site sanitation systems (such as pit latrines and septic tanks). Common bacterial contaminants include E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter jejuni. Common viral contaminants include norovirus, sapovirus, rotavirus, enteroviruses, and hepatitis A and E. Parasites include Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora cayetanensis, and microsporidia.[15]\\r\\nChemical contamination is a common problem with groundwater.[16] Nitrates from sewage, sewage sludge or fertilizer are a particular problem for babies and young children. Pollutant chemicals include pesticides and volatile organic compounds from gasoline, dry-cleaning, the fuel additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and perchlorate from rocket fuel, airbag inflators, and other artificial and natural sources.[citation needed]\\r\\nSeveral minerals are also contaminants, including lead leached from brass fittings or old lead pipes, chromium VI from electroplating and other sources, naturally occurring arsenic, radon, and uraniumall of which can cause cancerand naturally occurring fluoride, which is desirable in low quantities to prevent tooth decay, but can cause dental fluorosis in higher concentrations.[15]\\r\\nSome chemicals are commonly present in water wells at levels that are not toxic, but can cause other problems. Calcium and magnesium cause what is known as hard water, which can precipitate and clog pipes or burn out water heaters. Iron and manganese can appear as dark flecks that stain clothing and plumbing, and can promote the growth of iron and manganese bacteria that can form slimy black colonies that clog pipes.[15]\\r\\nThe quality of the well water can be significantly increased by lining the well, sealing the well head, fitting a self-priming hand pump, constructing an apron, ensuring the area is kept clean and free from stagnant water and animals, moving sources of contamination (pit latrines, garbage pits, on-site sewer systems) and carrying out hygiene education. The well should be cleaned with 1% chlorine solution after construction and periodically every 6 months.[citation needed]\\r\\nWell holes should be covered to prevent loose debris, animals, animal excrement, and wind-blown foreign matter from falling into the hole and decomposing. The cover should be able to be in place at all times, including when drawing water from the well. A suspended roof over an open hole helps to some degree, but ideally the cover should be tight fitting and fully enclosing, with only a screened air vent.[citation needed]\\r\\nMinimum distances and soil percolation requirements between sewage disposal sites and water wells need to be observed. Rules regarding the design and installation of private and municipal septic systems take all these factors into account so that nearby drinking water sources are protected.\\r\\nEducation of the general population in society also plays an important role in protecting drinking water.[citation needed]\\r\\nCleanup of contaminated groundwater tends to be very costly. Effective remediation of groundwater is generally very difficult. Contamination of groundwater from surface and subsurface sources can usually be dramatically reduced by correctly centering the casing during construction and filling the casing annulus with an appropriate sealing material. The sealing material (grout) should be placed from immediately above the production zone back to surface, because, in the absence of a correctly constructed casing seal, contaminated fluid can travel into the well through the casing annulus. Centering devices are important (usually 1 per length of casing or at maximum intervals of 9?m) to ensure that the grouted annular space is of even thickness.[citation needed] Upon the construction of a new test well, it is considered best practice to invest in a complete battery of chemical and biological tests on the well water in question. Point-of-use treatment is available for individual properties and treatment plants are often constructed for municipal water supplies that suffer from contamination. Most of these treatment methods involve the filtration of the contaminants of concern, and additional protection may be garnered by installing well-casing screens only at depths where contamination is not present.[citation needed]\\r\\nWell water for personal use is often filtered with reverse osmosis water processors; this process can remove very small particles. A simple, effective way of killing microorganisms is to bring the water to a full boil for one to three minutes, depending on location. A household well contaminated by microorganisms can initially be treated by shock chlorination using bleach, generating concentrations hundreds of times greater than found in community water systems; however, this will not fix any structural problems that led to the contamination and generally requires some expertise and testing for effective application.[15]\\r\\nAfter the filtration process, it is common to implement an Ultraviolet (UV) system to kill pathogens in the water. UV light effects the DNA of the pathogen by UV-C photons breaking through the cell wall. UV disinfection has been gaining popularity in the past decades as it is a chemical free method of water treatment.[17]\\r\\nA risk with the placement of water wells is soil salination which occurs when the water table of the soil begins to drop and salt begins to accumulate as the soil begins to dry out.[18] Another environmental problem that is very prevalent in water well drilling is the potential for methane to seep through.\\r\\nThe potential for soil salination is a large risk when choosing the placement of water wells. Soil salination is caused when the water table of the soil drops over time and salt begins to accumulate. In turn, the increased amount of salt begins to dry the soil out. This is a very detrimental problem because the increased level of salt in the soil can result in the degradation of soil and can be very harmful to vegetation.[citation needed]\\r\\nMethane, an asphyxiant, is a chemical compound that is the main component of natural gas. When methane is introduced into a confined space, it displaces oxygen, reducing oxygen concentration to a level low enough to pose a threat to humans and other aerobic organisms but still high enough for a risk of spontaneous or externally caused explosion. This potential for explosion is what poses such a danger in regards to the drilling and placement of water wells.[citation needed]\\r\\nLow levels of methane in drinking water are not considered toxic. When methane seeps into a water supply, it is commonly referred to as \\"methane migration\\". This can be caused by old natural gas wells near water well systems becoming abandoned and no longer monitored.[citation needed]\\r\\nLately,[when?] however, the described wells/pumps are no longer very efficient and can be replaced by either handpumps or treadle pumps. Another alternative is the use of self-dug wells, electrical deep-well pumps (for higher depths). Appropriate technology organizations as Practical Action are now[when?] supplying information on how to build/set-up (DIY) handpumps and treadle pumps in practice.[19][20]\\r\\nSprings and wells have had cultural significance since prehistoric times, leading to the foundation of towns such as Wells and Bath in Somerset. Interest in health benefits led to the growth of spa towns including many with wells in their name, examples being Llandrindod Wells and Royal Tunbridge Wells.[citation needed]\\r\\nEratosthenes first calculated the radius of the Earth in about 230?BC by comparing shadows in wells during the summer solstice.[citation needed]\\r\\nMany incidents in the Bible take place around wells, such as the finding of a wife for Isaac in Genesis and Jesus's talk with the Samaritan woman in the Gospels.[citation needed]","input":"What is the typical source of well water?"},{"output":"seven","context":"Army Wives is an American drama television series that aired Lifetime from June 3, 2007 to June 9, 2013 for a total of seven seasons and 117 episodes.[1][2]","input":"How many seasons are there for army wives?"},{"output":"Colonel Harland David Sanders","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Harland David Sanders[a] (September 9, 1890?ÿ December 16, 1980) was an American businessman, best known for founding fast food chicken restaurant chain Kentucky Fried Chicken (now known as KFC) and later acting as the company's brand ambassador and symbol. His name and image are still symbols of the company. The title 'colonel' was honorary ÿ a Kentucky colonel ÿ not the military rank.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders held a number of jobs in his early life, such as steam engine stoker, insurance salesman and filling station operator. He began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in North Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression. During that time  Sanders developed his \\"secret recipe\\" and his patented method of cooking chicken in a pressure fryer. Sanders recognized the potential of the restaurant franchising concept, and the first KFC franchise opened in Utah in 1952. When his original restaurant closed, he devoted himself full-time to franchising his fried chicken throughout the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company's rapid expansion across the United States and overseas became overwhelming for Sanders. In 1964, then 73 years old, he sold the company to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown, Jr. and Jack C. Massey for $2 million ($15.8 million today). However, he retained control of operations in Canada, and he became a salaried brand ambassador for Kentucky Fried Chicken.  In his later years, he became highly critical of the food served by KFC restaurants, as he believed they had cut costs and allowed quality to deteriorate.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarland David Sanders was born on September 9, 1890, in a four-room house located 3 miles (5?km) east of Henryville, Indiana.[1] He was the oldest of three children born to Wilbur David and Margaret Ann (ne Dunlevy) Sanders.[1] The family attended the Advent Christian Church.[2] His father was a mild and affectionate man who worked his 80-acre farm, until he broke his leg after a fall. He then worked as a butcher in Henryville for two years. Sanders' mother was a devout Christian and strict parent, continuously warning her children of \\"the evils of alcohol, tobacco, gambling, and whistling on Sundays.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders'  father died in 1895. His mother got work in a tomato cannery, and the young Harland was left to look after and cook for his siblings.[1] By the age of seven, he was reportedly skilled with bread and vegetables, and improving with meat; the children foraged for food while their mother was away for days at a time for work.[4] When he was 10, Sanders began to work as a farmhand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1902, Sanders' mother remarried to William Broaddus,[5] and the family moved to Greenwood, Indiana.[6] Sanders had a tumultuous relationship with his stepfather. In 1903, he dropped out of seventh grade (later stating that \\"algebra's what drove me off\\"), and went to live and work on a nearby farm.[6] At age 13, he left home.[3] He then took a job painting horse carriages in Indianapolis. When he was 14, he moved to southern Indiana to work as a farmhand.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1906, with his mother's approval, Sanders left the area to live with his uncle in New Albany, Indiana.[7] His uncle worked for the streetcar company, and secured Sanders a job as a conductor.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders falsified his date of birth and enlisted in the United States Army in October 1906, completing his service commitment as a wagoner (see teamster) in Cuba.[7] He was honorably discharged in February 1907 and moved to Sheffield, Alabama, where his uncle lived.[7] There, he met his brother Clarence who had also moved there in order to escape their stepfather.[7] The uncle worked for the Southern Railway, and secured Sanders a job there as a blacksmith's helper in the workshops.[6] After two months, Sanders moved to Jasper, Alabama where he got a job cleaning out the ash pans of trains from the Northern Alabama Railroad (a division of the Southern Railway) when they had finished their runs.[6] Sanders progressed to become a fireman (steam engine stoker) at the age of 16 or 17.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1909, Sanders found laboring work with the Norfolk and Western Railway.[6] While working on the railroad, he met Josephine King of Jasper, Alabama, and they were married shortly afterwards. They would go on to have a son, Harland, Jr., who died in 1932 from infected tonsils, and two daughters, Margaret Sanders and Mildred Sanders Ruggles.[9][10] He then found work as a fireman on the Illinois Central Railroad, and he and his family moved to Jackson, Tennessee.[6] By night, Sanders studied law by correspondence through the La Salle Extension University.[6] Sanders lost his job at Illinois after brawling with a colleague.[11] While Sanders moved to work for the Rock Island Railroad, Josephine and the children went to live with her parents.[6] After a while, Sanders began to practice law in Little Rock, which he did for three years, earning enough in fees for his family to move with him.[6] His legal career ended after a courtroom brawl with his own client.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that, Sanders moved back with his mother in Henryville, and went to work as a laborer on the Pennsylvania Railroad.[6] In 1916, the family moved to Jeffersonville, where Sanders got a job selling life insurance for the Prudential Life Insurance Company.[6] Sanders was eventually fired for insubordination.[13] He moved to Louisville and got a sales job with Mutual Benefit Life of New Jersey.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1920, Sanders established a ferry boat company, which operated a boat on the Ohio River between Jeffersonville and Louisville.[6] He canvassed for funding, becoming a minority shareholder himself, and was appointed secretary of the company.[6] The ferry was an instant success.[14] Around 1922 he took a job as secretary at the Chamber of Commerce in Columbus, Indiana.[6] He admitted that he was not very good at the job, and resigned after less than a year.[6] Sanders cashed in his ferry boat company shares for $22,000 ($316,000 today) and used the money to establish a company manufacturing acetylene lamps.[6] The venture failed after Delco introduced an electric lamp that it sold on credit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders moved to Winchester, Kentucky, to work as a salesman for the Michelin Tire Company.[6] He lost his job in 1924 when Michelin closed its New Jersey manufacturing plant.[15] In 1924, by chance, he met the general manager of Standard Oil of Kentucky, who asked him to run a service station in Nicholasville.[6] In 1930, the station closed as a result of the Great Depression.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1930, the Shell Oil Company offered Sanders a service station in North Corbin, Kentucky, rent free, in return for paying the company a percentage of sales.[6] Sanders began to serve chicken dishes and other meals such as country ham and steaks.[17] Initially he served the customers in his adjacent living quarters before opening a restaurant. It was during this period that Sanders was involved in a shootout with Matt Stewart, a local competitor, over the repainting of a sign directing traffic to his station.  Stewart killed a Shell employee who was with Sanders and was convicted of murder, eliminating Sanders's competition.[18]  Sanders was commissioned as a Kentucky colonel in 1935 by Kentucky governor Ruby Laffoon. His local popularity grew, and, in 1939, food critic Duncan Hines visited Sanders's restaurant and included it in Adventures in Good Eating, his guide to restaurants throughout the US. The entry read:\\r\\n\\r\\nCorbin, KY. ? Sanders Court and Caf41  Jct. with 25, 25 E. ? Mi. N. of Corbin.

L.?50S to $1; D.,?60S to $1\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 1939, Sanders acquired a motel in Asheville, North Carolina.[19] His North Corbin restaurant and motel was destroyed in a fire in November 1939, and Sanders had it rebuilt as a motel with a 140-seat restaurant.[19] By July 1940, Sanders had finalized his \\"Secret Recipe\\" for frying chicken in a pressure fryer that cooked the chicken faster than pan frying. As the United States entered World War II in December 1941, gas was rationed, and as the tourism dried up, Sanders was forced to close his Asheville motel. He went to work as a supervisor in Seattle until the latter part of 1942.[6] He later ran cafeterias for the government at an ordnance works in Tennessee, followed by a job as assistant cafeteria manager in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe left his mistress, Claudia Ledington-Price, as manager of the North Corbin restaurant and motel.[6] In 1942, he sold the Asheville business.[6] In 1947, he and Josephine divorced and Sanders married Claudia in 1949, as he had long desired.[20] Sanders was \\"re-commissioned\\" as a Kentucky colonel in 1950 by his friend, Governor Lawrence Wetherby.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1952, Sanders franchised his secret recipe \\"Kentucky Fried Chicken\\" for the first time, to Pete Harman of South Salt Lake, Utah, the operator of one of that city's largest restaurants.[22] In the first year of selling the product, restaurant sales more than tripled, with 75% of the increase coming from sales of fried chicken.[23] For Harman, the addition of fried chicken was a way of differentiating his restaurant from competitors; in Utah, a product hailing from Kentucky was unique and evoked imagery of Southern hospitality.[24] Don Anderson, a sign painter hired by Harman, coined the name Kentucky Fried Chicken.[24] After Harman's success, several other restaurant owners franchised the concept and paid Sanders $0.04 per chicken.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders believed that his North Corbin restaurant would remain successful indefinitely, but at age 65 sold it after the new Interstate 75 reduced customer traffic.[25][26][4] Left only with his savings and $105 a month from Social Security,[4] Sanders decided to begin to franchise his chicken concept in earnest, and traveled the US looking for suitable restaurants. After closing the North Corbin site, Sanders and Claudia opened a new restaurant and company headquarters in Shelbyville in 1959.[27] Often sleeping in the back of his car, Sanders visited restaurants, offered to cook his chicken, and if workers liked it negotiated franchise rights.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough such visits required much time, eventually potential franchisees began visiting Sanders instead. He ran the company while Claudia mixed and shipped the spices to restaurants.[4] The franchise approach became highly successful; KFC was one of the first fast food chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in Canada and later in the UK, Mexico and Jamaica by the mid-1960s. Sanders obtained a patent protecting his method of pressure frying chicken in 1962,[28] and trademarked the phrase \\"It's Finger Lickin' Good\\" in 1963.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company's rapid expansion to more than 600 locations became overwhelming for the aging Sanders. In 1964, then 73 years old, he sold the Kentucky Fried Chicken corporation for $2 million ($15.8 million today) to a partnership of Kentucky businessmen headed by John Y. Brown, Jr.,a 29-year-old lawyer and future governor of Kentucky, and Jack C. Massey, a venture capitalist and entrepreneur. Sanders became a salaried brand ambassador. The initial deal did not include the Canadian operations, which Sanders retained, or the franchising rights in the UK, Florida, Utah, and Montana, which Sanders had already sold to others.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965, Sanders moved to Mississauga, Ontario to oversee his Canadian franchises and continued to collect franchise and appearance fees both in Canada and in the US. Sanders bought and lived in a bungalow at 1337 Melton Drive in the Lakeview area of Mississauga from 1965 to 1980.[30] In September 1970 he and his wife were baptized in the Jordan River.[31] He also befriended Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders remained the company's symbol after selling it, traveling 200,000 miles a year on the company's behalf and filming many TV commercials and appearances. He retained much influence over executives and franchisees, who respected his culinary expertise and feared what The New Yorker described as \\"the force and variety of his swearing\\" when a restaurant or the company varied from what executives described as \\"the Colonel's chicken\\". One change the company made was to the gravy, which Sanders had bragged was so good that \\"it'll make you throw away the durn chicken and just eat the gravy\\" but which the company simplified to reduce time and cost. As late as 1979 Sanders made surprise visits to KFC restaurants, and if the food disappointed him, he denounced it to the franchisee as \\"God-damned slop\\" or pushed it onto the floor.[4][32] In 1973, Sanders sued Heublein Inc.the then parent company of Kentucky Fried Chickenover the alleged misuse of his image in promoting products he had not helped develop. In 1975, Heublein Inc. unsuccessfully sued Sanders for libel after he publicly described their gravy as being \\"sludge\\" with a \\"wall-paper taste\\".[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders and his wife reopened their Shelbyville restaurant as \\"Claudia Sanders, The Colonel's Lady\\" and served KFC-style chicken there as part of a full-service dinner menu, and talked about expanding the restaurant into a chain.[33] He was sued by the company for it.[33][34] After reaching a settlement with Heublein, he sold the Colonel's Lady restaurant, and it has continued to operate, currently as the Claudia Sanders Dinner House.[33][34] It serves his \\"original recipe\\" fried chicken as part of its non-fast-food dinner menu, and it is the only non-KFC restaurant that serves an authorized version of the fried chicken recipe.[35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders remained critical of Kentucky Fried Chicken's food. In the late 1970s he told the Louisville Courier-Journal:[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nMy God, that gravy is horrible. They buy tap water for 15 to 20 cents a thousand gallons and then they mix it with flour and starch and end up with pure wallpaper paste. And I know wallpaper paste, by God, because I've seen my mother make it. ... There's no nutrition in it and they ought not to be allowed to sell it. ... crispy recipe is nothing in the world but a damn fried doughball stuck on some chicken.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being recommissioned as a Kentucky colonel in 1950 by Governor Lawrence Wetherby, Sanders began to dress the part, growing a goatee and wearing a black frock coat (later switching to a white suit), a string tie, and referring to himself as \\"Colonel\\".[21] His associates went along with the title change, \\"jokingly at first and then in earnest\\", according to biographer Josh Ozersky.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe never wore anything else in public during the last 20 years of his life, using a heavy wool suit in the winter and a light cotton suit in the summer.[25] He bleached his mustache and goatee to match his white hair.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders was diagnosed with acute leukemia in June 1980.[9][38] He died at Jewish Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky of pneumonia on December 16, 1980 at the age of 90.[39][40][41] Sanders had remained active until the month before his death, appearing in his white suit to crowds.[32] His body lay in state in the rotunda of the Kentucky State Capitol in Frankfort after a funeral service at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary Chapel, which was attended by more than 1,000 people. Sanders was buried in his characteristic white suit and black western string tie in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time of Sanders' death, there were an estimated 6,000 KFC outlets in 48 countries worldwide, with $2 billion ($5.9 billion today) of sales annually.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nA fictionalized Colonel Sanders has repeatedly appeared as a mascot in KFC's advertising and branding. Sanders has been voiced by impressionists in radio ads, and from 1998 to 2001 an animated version of him voiced by Randy Quaid appeared in television commercials.[43]  In May 2015, KFC reprised the Colonel Sanders character in new television advertisements, played by comedian Darrell Hammond.[32][44] Some commentators felt the new portrayal was distasteful and disrespectful of the actual man's legacy.[32][45][46][47] In August 2015, KFC launched a new campaign, this time with comedian Norm Macdonald portraying Sanders; the first ad of the campaign makes direct reference to the Hammond campaign, with a brief piece of footage of Hammond followed by Macdonald's Colonel declaring his predecessor an impostor.[48] In February 2016, yet another portrayal was introduced with Jim Gaffigan as the Colonel, shown bolting awake in bed and telling his wife about his recurring nightmare of Macdonald's Colonel \\"pretending to be me\\".[49] By July 2016, George Hamilton was playing Colonel Sanders, parlaying his famous tan into an advertisement for KFC's \\"extra crispy\\" chicken.[50] During the airing of the 2016 SummerSlam, a commercial aired of WWE wrestler Dolph Ziggler dressed up as Colonel Sanders beating up a man in a chicken suit (played by fellow wrestler The Miz) in a wrestling ring.[51] In September 2016 comedian Rob Riggle played Sanders in an ad introducing a football team named \\"The Kentucky Buckets\\".[52] In January 2017, to advertise their \\"Georgia Gold Honey Mustard BBQ\\" Chicken offerings, actor Billy Zane took over the role as the \\"Solid Gold Colonel\\".[53] In April 2017, actor Rob Lowe was announced as the newest actor in the role of Colonel Sanders.[54]  Lowe said that as a child, he actually got to meet Harland Sanders.[55] WWE would return to using Colonel Sanders during 2017, showing ads of Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle playing him, as well as announcing that Colonel Sanders would be available as a playable character in WWE 2K18 (accessible through the \\"create-a-wrestler\\" feature) as part of a product placement deal with KFC.[56] Ray Liotta then portrayed Sanders, and singer Reba McEntire was named as the newest Sanders in January 2018.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball league has developed an urban legend of the \\"Curse of the Colonel\\". A statue of Colonel Sanders was thrown into a river and lost during a 1985 fan celebration, and (according to the legend) the \\"curse\\" has caused Japan's Hanshin Tigers to perform poorly since the incident.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nCharacters based on Colonel Sanders have appeared in popular fiction.  Within the DC Comics multiverse, alternate versions of the Colonel appear in the promotional title KFC: The Colonel Corps.[59]  In the novel Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami, Colonel Sanders appears when an \\"abstract concept\\" takes on the appearance of \\"a famous capitalist icon.\\"[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of Colonel Sanders' white suits with its black clip-on bow-tie was sold at auction for $21,510 by Heritage Auctions on June 22, 2013.[61] The suit had been given to Cincinnati resident Mike Morris by Sanders, who was close to Morris's family. The Morris family house was purchased by Col. Sanders, and Sanders lived with the family for six months.[62]  The suit was purchased by Kentucky Fried Chicken of Japan president Maseo \\"Charlie\\" Watanabe. Watanabe put on the famous suit after placing the winning bid at the auction event in Dallas, Texas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, a manuscript of a book on cooking that Sanders apparently wrote in the mid-1960s was found in KFC archives. It includes some cooking recipes from Sanders as well as anecdotes and life lessons. KFC said it was planning to try some of the recipes and to publish the 200-page manuscript online.[63][64]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore his death Sanders used his stock holdings to create the Colonel Harland Sanders Charitable Organization, a registered Canadian charity.[65] The wing of Mississauga Hospital for women's and children's care is named The Colonel Harland Sanders Family Care Centre in honor of his substantial donation.[66] Sanders' foundation has also made sizeable donations to other Canadian children's hospitals including the McMaster Children's Hospital, IWK Health Centre, and Stollery Children's Hospital.[67] The Toronto-based foundation disbursed $500,000 to other Canadian charities in 2016, according to its tax return filed with the Canada Revenue Agency.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes and citations\\r\\n\\r\\nSources","input":"Who was the founder of kentucky fried chicken?"},{"output":"12.4% of the total population, or about 172 million people","context":"Poverty is a significant issue in India, despite having one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, clocked at a growth rate of 7.6% in 2015, and a sizable consumer economy. The World Bank reviewed and proposed revisions in May 2014, to its poverty calculation methodology and purchasing power parity basis for measuring poverty worldwide, including India. According to this revised methodology, the world had 872.3 million people below the new poverty line, of which 179.6 million people lived in India. In other words, India with 17.5% of total world's population, had 20.6% share of world's poorest in 2011.[1][2] As of 2014, 58% of the total population were living on less than $3.10 per day.[3] According to the Modified Mixed Reference Period (MMRP) concept proposed by World Bank in 2015, India's poverty rate for period 2011-12 stood at 12.4% of the total population, or about 172 million people; taking the revised poverty line as $1.90.[4][5][6]\\r\\nThe World Bank has been revising its definition and benchmarks to measure up poverty since 1990, with a $2 per day income on purchasing power parity basis as the definition in use from 2005 to 2013.[7] Some semi-economic and non-economic indices have also been proposed to measure poverty in India; for example, the Multi-dimensional Poverty Index placed 33% weight on number of years spent in school and education and 6.25% weight on financial condition of a person, in order to determine if that a person is poor.[8]\\r\\nThe different definitions and different underlying small sample surveys used to determine poverty in India, have resulted in widely different estimates of poverty from 1950s to 2010s. In 2012, the Indian government stated 22% of its population is below its official poverty limit.[9] The World Bank, in 2011 based on 2005's PPPs International Comparison Program,[10] estimated 23.6% of Indian population, or about 276 million people, lived below $1.25 per day on purchasing power parity.[11][1] According to United Nation's Millennium Development Goals (MDG) programme 270 millions or 21.9% people out of 1.2 billion of Indians lived below poverty line of $1.25 in 2011-2012.[12]\\r\\nFrom late 19th century through early 20th century, under British colonial rule, poverty in India intensified, peaking in 1920s.[13][14] Famines and diseases killed millions each time.[15][16] After India gained its independence in 1947, mass deaths from famines were prevented. Rapid economic growth since 1991, has led to sharp reductions in extreme poverties in India.[17][18] However, those above poverty line live a fragile economic life.[19]\\r\\nAs per the methodology of the Suresh Tendulkar Committee report, that the population below the poverty line in India in 2009-2010 was 354 million (29.6% of the population) and that in 2011-2012 was 269 million (21.9% of the population).[20] The Rangarajan Committee said in 2014 that the population below the poverty line in 2009-2010 was 454 million (38.2% of the population) and that in 2011-2012 was 363 million (29.5% of the population).[21] Deutsche Bank Research estimated that there are nearly 300 million people who are middle class.[22] If former trends continue, India's share of world GDP will significantly increase from 7.3% in 2016 to 8.5% by 2020.[23] In 2015, around 170 million people, or 12.4%, lived in poverty (defined as $1.90 (Rs 123.5)), a reduction from 29.8% in 2009.[24][25]\\r\\nThe Asian Development Bank estimates India's population to be at 1.28 billion with an average growth rate, from 2010-2015, at 1.3%. In 2014, 49.9% of the population aged 15 years and above were employed. However, there are still 21.9% of the population who live below the national poverty line.[26] The World Poverty Clock shows real-time poverty trends in India, which are based on the latest data, of the World Bank, among others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several definitions of poverty, and scholars disagree as to which definition is appropriate for India.[27][28] Inside India, both income-based poverty definition and consumption-based poverty statistics are in use.[29] Outside India, the World Bank and institutions of the United Nations use a broader definition to compare poverty among nations, including India, based on purchasing power parity (PPP), as well as nominal relative basis.[30][31] Each state in India has its own poverty threshold to determine how many people are below its poverty line and to reflect regional economic conditions. These differences in definition yield a complex and conflicting picture about poverty in India, both internally and when compared to other developing countries of the world.[2]\\r\\nAs with many countries,[32] poverty was historically defined and estimated in India using a sustenance food standard. This methodology has been revised. India's current official poverty rates are based on its Planning Commission's data derived from so-called Tendulkar methodology.[33] It defines poverty not in terms of annual income, but in terms of consumption or spending per individual over a certain period for a basket of essential goods. Further, this methodology sets different poverty lines for rural and urban areas. Since 2007, India set its official threshold at ? 26 a day ($0.43) in rural areas and about ? 32 per day ($0.53) in urban areas.[34] While these numbers are lower than the World Bank's $1.25 per day income-based definition, the definition is similar to China's US$0.65 per day official poverty line in 2008.[35]\\r\\nThe World Bank's international poverty line definition is based on purchasing power parity basis, at $1.25 per day.[36][37] This definition is inspired by the reality that the price of same goods, and services such as a haircut, are quite different in local currencies around the world. A realistic definition and comparison of poverty must consider these differences in costs of living, or must be on purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. On this basis, currency fluctuations and nominal numbers become less important, the definition is based on the local costs of a basket of essential goods and services that people can purchase. By World Bank's 2014 PPP definition, India's poverty rate is significantly lower than previously believed.[2]\\r\\nAs with economic measures, there are many mixed or non-economic measures of poverty and experts contest which one is most appropriate for India. For example, Dandekar and Rath in 1971 suggested a measure of poverty rate that was based on number of calories consumed.[38] In 2011, Alkire et al. suggested a poverty rate measure so-called Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which put only 6.25% weight to assets owned by a person and placed 33% weight on education and number of years spent in school.[8] These non-economic measures remain controversial and contested as a measure of poverty rate of any nation, including India.[39][40]\\r\\nIndia determines household poverty line by summing up the individual per capita poverty lines of the household members. This practice is similar to many developing countries, but different from developed countries such as the United States that adjust poverty line on an incremental basis per additional household member. For example, in the United States, the poverty line for a household with just one member was set at $11,670 per year for 2014, while it was set at $23,850 per year for a 4-member household (or $5963 per person for the larger household).[46] The rationale for the differences arise from the economic realities of each country. In India, households may include surviving grandparents, parents and children. They typically do not incur any or significant rent expenses every month particularly in rural India, unlike housing in mostly urban developed economies. The cost of food and other essentials are shared within the household by its members in both cases. However, a larger portion of a monthly expenditure goes to food in poor households in developing countries,[47] while housing, conveyance and other essentials cost significantly more in developed economies.\\r\\nFor its current poverty rate measurements, India calculates two benchmarks. The first includes a basket of goods including food items but does not include the implied value of home, value of any means of conveyance or the economic value of other essentials created, grown or used without a financial transaction, by the members of a household. The second poverty line benchmark adds rent value of residence as well as the cost of conveyance, but nothing else, to the first benchmark.[48] This practice is similar to those used in developed countries for non-cash income equivalents and poverty line basis.[49][50]\\r\\nIndia's proposed but not yet adopted official poverty line, in 2014, was ?972 (US$15) a month in rural areas or ?1,407 (US$22) a month in cities. The current poverty line is $14 per month ($0.46 per day) in rural areas and $17 per month ($0.56 per day) in urban areas.[51] India's nationwide average poverty line differs from each state's poverty line. For example, in 2011-2012, Puducherry had its highest poverty line of ?1,301 (US$20) a month in rural and ?1,309 (US$20) a month in urban areas, while Odisha had the lowest poverty thresholds of ?695 (US$11) a month for rural and ?861 (US$13) a month for its urban areas.[52]\\r\\nThe 19th century and early 20th century saw increasing poverty in India during the colonial era.[13][53] Over this period, the colonial government de-industrialized India by reducing garments and other finished products manufacturing by artisans in India, importing these from Britain's expanding industry with 19th century industrial innovations, while simultaneously encouraging conversion of more land into farms, and of agricultural exports from India.[54][55] Eastern regions of India along the Ganges river plains, such as those now known as eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal,[56] were dedicated to producing poppy and opium, which were then exported to southeast and east Asia particularly China, with the trade an exclusive monopoly first of East India Company, and later the colonial British institutions.[57] The economic importance of this shift from industry to agriculture in India was large;[58] by 1850, it created nearly 1,000 square kilometres of poppy farms in India in its fertile Ganges plains, led to two opium wars in Asia, with the second opium war fought between 1856 and 1860. After China accepted opium trade, the colonial government dedicated more land exclusively to poppy,[55] the opium agriculture in India rose from 1850 through 1900, when over 500,000 acres of the most fertile Ganges basin farms were devoted to poppy cultivation,[59] opium processing factories owned by colonial officials were expanded in Benares and Patna, and shipping expanded from Bengal to the ports of East Asia such as Hong Kong, all under exclusive monopoly of the British. By early 20th century, 3 out of 4 Indians were employed in agriculture, famines were common, and food consumption per capita declined in every decade.[14] In London, the late 19th century British parliament debated the repeated incidence of famines in India, and the impoverishment of Indians due to this diversion of agriculture land from growing food staples to growing poppy for opium export under orders of the colonial British empire.[55][59]\\r\\nThese colonial policies moved unemployed artisans into farming, and transformed India as a region increasingly abundant in land, unskilled labour and low productivity, and scarce in skilled labour, capital and knowledge.[13][14] On an inflation adjusted 1973 Rupee basis, the average income of Indian agrarian labourer was Rs. 7.20 per year in 1885, against an inflation adjusted poverty line of Rs. 23.90 per year. Thus, not only was the average income below poverty line, the intensity of poverty was severe. The intensity of poverty increased from 1885 to 1921, then began a reversal. However, the absolute poverty rates continued to be very high through the 1930s.[13][61] The colonial policies on taxation and its recognition of land ownership claims of zamindars and mansabdars, or Mughal era nobility, made a minority of families wealthy, while it weakened the ability of poorer peasants to command land and credit. The resulting rising landlessness and stagnant real wages intensified poverty.[13][62]\\r\\nThe National Planning Committee of 1936 noted the appalling poverty of undivided India.[63]\\r\\n(...) there was lack of food, of clothing, of housing and of every other essential requirement of human existence... the development policy objective should be to get rid of the appalling poverty of the people.\\r\\nThe National Planning Committee, notes Suryanarayana, then defined goals in 1936 to alleviate poverty by setting targets in terms of nutrition (2400 to 2800 calories per adult worker), clothing (30 yards per capita per annum) and housing (100 sq. ft per capita).[63] This method of linking poverty as a function of nutrition, clothing and housing continued in India after it became independent from British colonial empire.\\r\\nThese poverty alleviation goals were theoretical, with administrative powers resident in the British Empire. Poverty ravaged India. In 1943, for example, despite rising agricultural output in undivided South Asia, the Bengal famine killed millions of Indians from starvation, disease and destitution. Destitution was so intense in Bengal, Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Orissa, that entire families and villages were \\"wiped out\\" of existence. Village artisans, along with sustenance farming families, died from lack of food, malnutrition and a wave of diseases.[16] The 1943 famine was not an isolated tragedy. Devastating famines impoverished India every 5 to 8 years in late 19th century and the first half of 20th century. Between 6.1 and 10.3 million people starved to death in British India during the 1876-1879 famine, while another 6.1 to 8.4 million people died during 1896-1898 famine.[64] The Lancet reported 19 million died from starvation and consequences of extreme poverty in British India, between 1896 and 1900.[65] Sir MacDonnell observed the suffering and poverty in 1900, and noted, \\"people died like flies\\" in Bombay.[66]\\r\\nMinhas published his estimates of poverty rates in 1950s India as cyclical and a strong function of each year's harvest. Minhas disagreed with the practice of using calories as the basis for poverty estimation and proposed a poverty line based on real expenditure per year (Rs 240 per annum). In 1956-57, a good harvest year, he computed India's poverty rate to be 65% (215 million people).[67][68] For 1960, Minhas estimated the poverty to be 59%.[69]\\r\\nA Working Group was formed in 1962 to attempt to set a poverty line for India.[70][71] This Working Group used calories required for survival, and income needed to buy those calories in different parts of rural India, to derive an average poverty line of Rs. 20 per month at 1960-61 prices.[72]\\r\\nEstimates of poverty in India during the 1960s varied widely. Dandekar and Rath, on the behalf of then Indian government, estimated that the poverty rate in 1960s remained generally constant at 41%. Ojha, in contrast, estimated that there were 190 million people (44%) in India below official poverty limit in 1961, and that this below-poverty line number increased to 289 million people (70%) in 1967. Bardhan also concluded that Indian poverty rates increased through the 1960s, reaching a high of 54%.[69][73] Those above the 1960s poverty level of Rs 240 per year, were in fragile economic groups as well and not doing well either. Minhas estimated that 95% of India's people lived on Rs 458 per year in 1963-64, while the richest 5% lived on an average of Rs 645 per year (all numbers inflation adjusted to 1960-61 Rupee).[67]\\r\\nDandekar and Rath[74] in 1971 used a daily intake of 2,250 calories per person to define the poverty line for India. Using NSSO data regarding household expenditures for 1960ÿ61, they determined that in order to achieve this food intake and other daily necessities, a rural dweller required an annual income of ? 170.80 per year (? 14.20 per month, adjusted to 1971 Rupee). An urban dweller required ? 271.70 per year (? 22.60 per month). They concluded from this study that 40 percent of rural residents and 50 percent of urban residents were below the poverty line in 1960ÿ61.[75]\\r\\nPoverty alleviation has been a driver for India's Planning Commission's Task Force on Projections of Minimum Needs and Effective Consumption Demand of the Perspective Planning Division. This division, in 1979, took into account differences in calorie requirements for different age groups, activity levels, and sex. They determined that the average rural dweller needed around 2400 calories, and those in urban areas required about 2100 calories per person per day. To satisfy the food requirement, the Task Force estimated that a consumer spending in 1973ÿ74 of Rs.49.09 per person per month in rural areas and Rs.56.64 in urban areas was appropriate measure to estimate its poverty line.[76]\\r\\nPoverty remained stubbornly high in India through the 1970s and 1980s. It created slogans such as Garibi Hatao (literally, abolish poverty) for political campaigns, during elections in early 1970s through the 1980s.[77] Rural poverty rate exceeded 50%, using India's official poverty line for 1970s.[78][79]\\r\\nAnother Expert Group was instituted in 1993, chaired by Lakdawala, to examine poverty line for India. It recommended that regional economic differences are large enough that poverty lines should be calculated for each state. From then on, a standard list of commodities were drawn up and priced in each state of the nation, using 1973ÿ74 as a base year. This basket of goods could then be re-priced each year and comparisons made between regions. The Government of India began using a modified version of this method of calculating the poverty line in India.[80]\\r\\nThere are wide variations in India's poverty estimates for 1990s, in part from differences in the methodology and in the small sample surveys they poll for the underlying data. A 2007 report for example, using data for late 1990s, stated that 77% of Indians lived on less than ? 20 a day (about US$0.50 per day).[81] In contrast, Datt estimated India's national poverty rate to be 35% in 1994, at India's then official poverty line of Rs 49 per capita, with consumer price index adjusted to June 1974 rural prices.[79]\\r\\nThe Saxena Committee report, using data from 1972 to 2000, separated calorific intake apart from nominal income in its economic analysis of poverty in India, and then stated that 50% of Indians lived below the poverty line.[82] The Planning Commission of India, in contrast, determined that the poverty rate was 39%.\\r\\nThe National Council of Applied Economic Research estimated that 48% of the Indian households earn more than ?90,000 (US$1,403.40) annually (or more than US$ 3 PPP per person). According to NCAER, in 2009, of the 222 million households in India, the absolutely poor households (annual incomes below ?45,000 (US$700) accounted for only 15.6% of them or about 35 million (about 200 million Indians). Another 80 million households are in the income levels of ?45,000 (US$700) to ?90,000 (US$1,400) per year. These numbers are similar to World Bank estimates of the \\"below-the-poverty-line\\" households that may total about 100 million (or about 456 million individuals).[83]\\r\\nThe Suresh Tendulkar Committee set up to look into the people living under the poverty line in India submitted its report in November 2009.[84] It provided a new method of calculating the poverty line based on per capita consumption expenditure per month or day. For rural areas, it was Rs 816 per month or Rs 27 per day. For urban areas, it was Rs 1000 per month or Rs 33 per day. Using this methodology, the population below the poverty line in 2009-2010 was 354 million (29.6% of the population) and that in 2011-2012 was 269 million (21.9% of the population).[85]\\r\\nIn its annual report of 2012, the Reserve Bank of India named the state of Goa as having the least poverty of 5.09% while the national average stood at 21.92%[9] The table below presents the poverty statistics for rural, urban and combined percentage below poverty line (BPL) for each State or Union Territory.[9] The highest poverty statistics for each category column is coloured light red in the table below.\\r\\nThe World Bank has reviewed its poverty definition and calculation methodologies several times over the last 25 years. In early 1990s, The World Bank anchored absolute poverty line as $1 per day. This was revised in 1993, and the absolute poverty line was set at $1.08 a day for all countries on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, after adjusting for inflation to the 1993 US dollar. In 2005, after extensive studies of cost of living across the world, The World Bank raised the measure for global poverty line to reflect the observed higher cost of living.[7] Thereafter, the World Bank determined poverty rates from those living on less than US$1.25 per day on 2005 PPP basis, a measure that has been widely used in media and scholarly circles.\\r\\nIn May 2014, after revisiting its poverty definition, methodology and economic changes around the world, the World Bank proposed another major revision to PPP calculation methodology, international poverty line and indexing it to 2011 US dollar.[2] The new method proposes setting poverty line at $1.78 per day on 2011 PPP basis. According to this revised World Bank methodology, India had 179.6 million people below the new poverty line, China had 137.6 million, and the world had 872.3 million people below the new poverty line on an equivalent basis as of 2013. India, in other words, while having 17.5% of total world's population, had 20.6% share of world's poor.[1][2] In October 2015, the World Bank updated the international poverty line to US$1.90 a day.\\r\\nThe Rangarajan Committee set up to look into the poverty line estimation in India submitted its report in June 2014.[86] It amended the calculation of the poverty line based on per capita consumption expenditure per month or day given by the Tendulkar Committee.[87] The new poverty threshold for rural areas was fixed at Rs 972 per month or Rs 32 per day. For urban areas, it was fixed at Rs 1407 per month or Rs 47 per day. Under this methodology, the population below the poverty line in 2009-2010 was 454 million (38.2% of the population) and that in 2011-2012 was 363 million (29.5% of the population).[88]\\r\\nOther measures such as the semi-economic Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which places 33% weight on education and number of schooling years in its definition of poverty, and places 6.25% weight on income and assets owned, suggests there were 650 million people (53.7% of population) living in MPI-poverty in India.[8] 421 million of MPI-defined poor are concentrated in eight North Indian and East Indian states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The table below presents this semi-economic poverty among the states of India based on the Multi-dimensional Poverty Index, using a small sample survey data for Indian states in 2005.[89]\\r\\nAccording to a 2011 poverty Development Goals Report, as many as 320 million people in India and China are expected to come out of extreme poverty in the next four years, with India's poverty rate projected to drop from 51% in 1990 to about 22% in 2015.[90] The report also indicates that in Southern Asia, only India is on track to cut poverty by half by the 2015 target date.[90] In 2015, according to United Nation's Millennium Development Goals (MGD) programme, India has already achieved the target of reducing poverty by half, with 24.7% of its 1.2 billion people in 2011 living below the poverty line or having income of less than $1.25 a day, the U.N. report said. The same figure was 49.4% in 1994. India had set a target of 23.9% to be achieved by 2015.[91]\\r\\nAccording to Global Wealth Report 2016[92] compiled by Credit Suisse Research Institute, India is the second most unequal country in the world with the top one per cent of the population owning 58% of the total wealth.[93]\\r\\nGlobal Hunger Index (GHI) is an index that places a third of weight on proportion of the population that is estimated to be undernourished, a third on the estimated prevalence of low body weight to height ratio in children younger than five, and remaining third weight on the proportion of children dying before the age of five for any reason. According to 2011 GHI report, India has improved its performance by 22% in 20 years, from 30.4 to 23.7 over 1990 to 2011 period.[94] However, its performance from 2001 to 2011 has shown little progress, with just 3% improvement. A sharp reduction in the percentage of underweight children has helped India improve its hunger record on the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2014. India now ranks 55 among 76 emerging economies. Between 2005 and 2014, the prevalence of underweight children under the age of five fell from 43.5% to 30.7%.[95]\\r\\nPoverty: 2011-2012 Percentage of people by Caste[96]\\r\\nFindings below are based on a survey conducted during 2011-12.\\r\\nTotal population of India 1,276,267,631\\r\\nPoverty in India based on caste.[96]\\r\\nPoverty in India based on Social and Religious Classes. The Sachar Committee looked at the Poverty by Social and Religious Classes[97]\\r\\nThe subject of the economic impact of British imperialism on India remains contentious. The issue was raised by British Whig politician Edmund Burke who in 1778 began a seven-year impeachment trial against Warren Hastings and the East India Company on charges including mismanagement of the Indian economy. Contemporary historian Rajat Kanta Ray argues the economy established by the British in the 18th century was a form of plunder and a catastrophe for the traditional economy of Mughal India, depleting food and money stocks and imposing high taxes that helped cause the famine of 1770, which killed a third of the people of Bengal.[98]\\r\\nSince the 1950s, the Indian government and non-governmental organisations have initiated several programs to alleviate poverty, including subsidising food and other necessities, increased access to loans, improving agricultural techniques and price supports, promoting education and family planning. These measures have helped eliminate famines, cut absolute poverty levels by more than half, and reduced illiteracy and malnutrition.\\r\\nAlthough the Indian economy has grown steadily over the last two decades, its growth has been uneven when comparing social groups, economic groups, geographic regions, and rural and urban areas.[99][100] For the year 2015-16, the GSDP growth rates of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh was higher than Maharashtra, Odisha or Punjab.[101]\\r\\nDespite significant economic progress, one quarter of the nation's population earns less than the government-specified poverty threshold of ?32 per day (approximately US$ 0.6).[102]\\r\\nAccording to the 2001 census, 35.5% of Indian households used banking services, 35.1% owned a radio or transistor, 31.6% a television, 9.1% a phone, 43.7% a bicycle, 11.7% a scooter, motorcycle or a moped, and 2.5% a car, jeep or van; 34.5% of the households had none of these assets.[103] According to Department of Telecommunications of India the phone density reached 73.34% by December 2012 and as an annual growth decreased by ?4.58%.[104] This tallies with the fact that a family of four with an annual income of ?137,000 (US$2,100) could afford some of these luxury items.\\r\\nThe World Bank's Global Monitoring Report for 2014-15 on the Millennium Development Goals says India has been the biggest contributor to poverty reduction between 2008 and 2011, with around 140 million or so lifted out of absolute poverty.[105] Since the early 1950s, Indian government initiated various schemes to help the poor attain self-sufficiency in food production. These have included ration cards and price controls over the supply of basic commodities, particularly food at controlled prices, available throughout the country. These efforts prevented famines, but did little to eliminate or reduce poverty in rural or urban areas between 1950 and 1980.[106]\\r\\nOne of the main reasons for record decline in Poverty is India's rapid economic growth rate since 1991.[17][18][107] Another reason proposed is India's launch of social welfare programs such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and Midday Meal Scheme in Government Schools.[citation needed] Klonner and Oldiges, in a 2012 study, conclude that MGNREGA helps reduce rural poverty gap (intensity of rural poverty), seasonal poverty, but not overall poverty.[108][109] However, there is a disturbing side, as deprivation has tended to increase, and that too among the most deprived sections. According to the latest statistics published by the Census of India; in scheduled tribe category 44.7 per cent people were farmers working on their own land in 2001; however this number came down to 34.5 per cent in 2011. In case of scheduled castes this number declined from 20 per cent to 14.8 per cent during the same period. This data is corroborated by another data from census, according to which number of people who were working not on their own land but on others' land (landless laborers), increased from 36.9 per cent in 2001 to 44.4 per cent in SC category and from 45.6 per cent to 45.9 per cent in case of ST category.[110]\\r\\nEconomic and socio-economic","input":"How much population is living below poverty line in india?"},{"output":"2,403 Americans","context":"Coordinates: 2122N 15757W? / ?21.367N 157.950W? / 21.367; -157.950\\r\\nMajor Japanese tactical victory; precipitated the entrance of the United States into World War II\\r\\nSoutheast Asia\\r\\nBurma\\r\\nSouthwest Pacific\\r\\nNorth America\\r\\nJapan\\r\\nManchuria\\r\\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor,[11] led to the United States' entry into World War II. The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI,[12][13] and as Operation Z during its planning.[14]\\r\\nJapan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions that were planned in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. Over the next seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong.[15]\\r\\nThe attack commenced at 7:48?a.m. Hawaiian Time (18:18 GMT).[nb 3][16] The base was attacked by 353[17] Imperial Japanese aircraft (including fighters, level and dive bombers, and torpedo bombers) in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers.[17] All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged, with four sunk. All but the USS?Arizona were later raised, and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship,[nb 4] and one minelayer. One hundred eighty-eight U.S. aircraft were destroyed; 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded.[19] Important base installations such as the power station, dry dock, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section), were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 64 servicemen killed. One Japanese sailor, Kazuo Sakamaki, was captured.\\r\\nThe surprise attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters. The following day, December 8, the United States declared war on Japan,[20][21] and several days later, on December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S. The U.S. responded with a declaration of war against Germany and Italy. Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been fading since the Fall of France in 1940,[22] disappeared.[21]\\r\\nThere were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan, but the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, \\"a date which will live in infamy\\". Because the attack happened without a declaration of war and without explicit warning, the attack on Pearl Harbor was later judged in the Tokyo Trials to be a war crime.[23][24]\\r\\nWar between Japan and the United States had been a possibility that each nation had been aware of (and developed contingency plans for) since the 1920s, though tensions did not begin to grow seriously until Japan's 1931 invasion of Manchuria. Over the next decade, Japan continued to expand into China, leading to all-out war between those countries in 1937. Japan spent considerable effort trying to isolate China and achieve sufficient resource independence to attain victory on the mainland; the \\"Southern Operation\\" was designed to assist these efforts.[25]\\r\\nFrom December 1937, events such as the Japanese attack on USS Panay, the Allison incident, and the Nanking Massacre (the International Military Tribunal of the Far East concluded that more than 200,000 Chinese non-combatants were killed in indiscriminate massacres, though other estimates have ranged from 40,000 to more than 300,000) swung public opinion in the West sharply against Japan. Fearing Japanese expansion,[26] the United States, the United Kingdom, and France provided loan assistance for war supply contracts to China.\\r\\nIn 1940, Japan invaded French Indochina in an effort to control supplies reaching China. The United States halted shipments of airplanes, parts, machine tools, and aviation gasoline to Japan, which was perceived by Japan as an unfriendly act.[nb 5] The U.S. did not stop oil exports to Japan at that time in part because prevailing sentiment in Washington was that such an action would be an extreme step that Japan would likely consider a provocation, given Japanese dependence on U.S. oil.[28][29]\\r\\nIn mid-1940 President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved the Pacific Fleet to Hawaii from its previous base in San Diego.[30] He also ordered a military buildup in the Philippines, both in the hope of discouraging Japanese aggression in the Far East. Because the Japanese high command was (mistakenly) certain that any attack on the UK's Southeast Asian colonies, including Singapore,[31] would bring the U.S. into war, a devastating preventive strike appeared to be the only way to avoid U.S. naval interference.[32] An invasion of the Philippines was also considered necessary by Japanese war planners. The U.S. War Plan Orange had envisioned defending the Philippines with a 40,000-man elite force. This was opposed by Douglas MacArthur, who felt that he would need a force ten times that size, and was never implemented.[33][self-published source] By 1941, U.S. planners anticipated abandonment of the Philippines at the outbreak of war and orders to that effect were given in late 1941 to Admiral Thomas Hart, commander of the Asiatic Fleet.[34]\\r\\nThe U.S. ceased oil exports to Japan in July 1941, following Japanese expansion into French Indochina after the Fall of France, in part because of new American restrictions on domestic oil consumption.[35] This in turn caused the Japanese to proceed with plans to take the Dutch East Indies, an oil-rich territory.[nb 6] On August 17, Roosevelt warned Japan that the U.S. was prepared to take steps against Japan if it attacked \\"neighboring countries\\".[37] The Japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich, European-controlled colonies of Southeast Asia.\\r\\nJapan and the U.S. engaged in negotiations during the course of 1941 in an effort to improve relations. During these negotiations, Japan offered to withdraw from most of China and Indochina when peace was made with the Nationalist government, adopt an independent interpretation of the Tripartite Pact, and not to discriminate in trade provided all other countries reciprocated. Washington rejected these proposals. Japanese Prime Minister Konoye then offered to meet with Roosevelt, but Roosevelt insisted on coming to an agreement before any meeting.[38] The U.S. ambassador to Japan repeatedly urged Roosevelt to accept the meeting, warning that it was the only way to preserve the conciliatory Konoye government and peace in the Pacific.[39] His recommendation was not acted upon. The Konoye government collapsed the following month when the Japanese military refused to agree to the withdrawal of all troops from China.[40]\\r\\nJapan's final proposal, on November 20, offered to withdraw their forces from southern Indochina and not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia provided that the U.S., the UK, and the Netherlands ceased aiding China and lifted their sanctions against Japan.[40] The American counter-proposal of November 26 (November 27 in Japan) (the Hull note) required Japan to evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with Pacific powers. However the day before the Hull Note was delivered, on November 26 in Japan, the main Japanese attack fleet left port for Pearl Harbor.\\r\\nPreliminary planning for an attack on Pearl Harbor to protect the move into the \\"Southern Resource Area\\" (the Japanese term for the Dutch East Indies and Southeast Asia generally) had begun very early in 1941 under the auspices of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, then commanding Japan's Combined Fleet.[41] He won assent to formal planning and training for an attack from the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff only after much contention with Naval Headquarters, including a threat to resign his command.[42] Full-scale planning was underway by early spring 1941, primarily by Rear Admiral Rynosuke Kusaka, with assistance from Captain Minoru Genda and Yamamoto's Deputy Chief of Staff, Captain Kameto Kuroshima.[43] The planners studied the 1940 British air attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto intensively.[nb 7][nb 8]\\r\\nOver the next several months, pilots were trained, equipment was adapted, and intelligence was collected. Despite these preparations, Emperor Hirohito did not approve the attack plan until November 5, after the third of four Imperial Conferences called to consider the matter.[46] Final authorization was not given by the emperor until December 1, after a majority of Japanese leaders advised him the \\"Hull Note\\" would \\"destroy the fruits of the China incident, endanger Manchukuo and undermine Japanese control of Korea.\\"[47]\\r\\nBy late 1941, many observers believed that hostilities between the U.S. and Japan were imminent. A Gallup poll just before the attack on Pearl Harbor found that 52% of Americans expected war with Japan, 27% did not, and 21% had no opinion.[48] While U.S. Pacific bases and facilities had been placed on alert on many occasions, U.S. officials doubted Pearl Harbor would be the first target; instead, they expected the Philippines would be attacked first. This presumption was due to the threat that the air bases throughout the country and the naval base at Manila posed to sea lanes, as well as to the shipment of supplies to Japan from territory to the south.[49] They also incorrectly believed that Japan was not capable of mounting more than one major naval operation at a time.[50]\\r\\nThe Japanese attack had several major aims. First, it intended to destroy important American fleet units, thereby preventing the Pacific Fleet from interfering with Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies and Malaya and to enable Japan to conquer Southeast Asia without interference. Second, it was hoped to buy time for Japan to consolidate its position and increase its naval strength before shipbuilding authorized by the 1940 Vinson-Walsh Act erased any chance of victory.[51][52] Third, to deliver a blow to America's ability to mobilize its forces in the Pacific, battleships were chosen as the main targets, since they were the prestige ships of any navy at the time.[51] Finally, it was hoped that the attack would undermine American morale such that the U.S. government would drop its demands contrary to Japanese interests, and would seek a compromise peace with Japan.[53][54]\\r\\nStriking the Pacific Fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor carried two distinct disadvantages: the targeted ships would be in very shallow water, so it would be relatively easy to salvage and possibly repair them; and most of the crews would survive the attack, since many would be on shore leave or would be rescued from the harbor. A further important disadvantagethis of timing, and known to the Japanesewas the absence from Pearl Harbor of all three of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's aircraft carriers (Enterprise, Lexington, and Saratoga). IJN top command was attached to Admiral Mahan's \\"decisive battle\\" doctrine, especially that of destroying the maximum number of battleships. Despite these concerns, Yamamoto decided to press ahead.[55][page?needed]\\r\\nJapanese confidence in their ability to achieve a short, victorious war also meant other targets in the harbor, especially the navy yard, oil tank farms, and submarine base, were ignored, sinceby their thinkingthe war would be over before the influence of these facilities would be felt.[56]\\r\\nOn November 26, 1941, a Japanese task force (the Striking Force) of six aircraft carriersAkagi, Kaga, Sry, Hiry, Shkaku, and Zuikakudeparted Hittokapu Bay on Kasatka (now Iterup) Island in the Kurile Islands, en route to a position northwest of Hawaii, intending to launch its 408 aircraft to attack Pearl Harbor: 360 for the two attack waves and 48 on defensive combat air patrol (CAP), including nine fighters from the first wave.\\r\\nThe first wave was to be the primary attack, while the second wave was to attack carriers as its first objective and cruisers as its second, with battleships as the third target.[57] The first wave carried most of the weapons to attack capital ships, mainly specially adapted Type 91 aerial torpedoes which were designed with an anti-roll mechanism and a rudder extension that let them operate in shallow water.[58] The aircrews were ordered to select the highest value targets (battleships and aircraft carriers) or, if these were not present, any other high value ships (cruisers and destroyers). First wave dive bombers were to attack ground targets. Fighters were ordered to strafe and destroy as many parked aircraft as possible to ensure they did not get into the air to intercept the bombers, especially in the first wave. When the fighters' fuel got low they were to refuel at the aircraft carriers and return to combat. Fighters were to serve CAP duties where needed, especially over U.S. airfields.[citation needed]\\r\\nBefore the attack commenced, two reconnaissance aircraft launched from cruisers Chikuma and Tone were sent to scout over Oahu and Maui and report on U.S. fleet composition and location. Reconnaissance aircraft flights risked alerting the U.S.,[59] and were not necessary. U.S. fleet composition and preparedness information in Pearl Harbor was already known due to the reports of the Japanese spy Takeo Yoshikawa. A report of the absence of the U.S. fleet in Lahaina anchorage off Maui was received from the fleet submarine I-72.[60] Another four scout planes patrolled the area between the Japanese carrier force (the Kid Butai) and Niihau, to detect any counterattack.[61]\\r\\nFleet submarines I-16, I-18, I-20, I-22, and I-24 each embarked a Type A midget submarine for transport to the waters off Oahu.[62] The five I-boats left Kure Naval District on November 25, 1941.[63] On December 6, they came to within 10?nmi (19?km; 12?mi) of the mouth of Pearl Harbor[64] and launched their midget subs at about 01:00[clarification needed] on December 7.[65] At 03:42[66] Hawaiian Time, the minesweeper Condor spotted a midget submarine periscope southwest of the Pearl Harbor entrance buoy and alerted the destroyer Ward.[67] The midget may have entered Pearl Harbor. However, Ward sank another midget submarine at 06:37[67][nb 9] in the first American shots in the Pacific Theater. A midget submarine on the north side of Ford Island missed the seaplane tender Curtiss with her first torpedo and missed the attacking destroyer Monaghan with her other one before being sunk by Monaghan at 08:43.[67]\\r\\nA third midget submarine, Ha-19, grounded twice, once outside the harbor entrance and again on the east side of Oahu, where it was captured on December 8.[69] Ensign Kazuo Sakamaki swam ashore and was captured by Hawaii National Guard Corporal David Akui, becoming the first Japanese prisoner of war.[nb 10] A fourth had been damaged by a depth charge attack and was abandoned by its crew before it could fire its torpedoes.[70] Japanese forces received a radio message from a midget submarine at 00:41 on December 8 claiming damage to one or more large warships inside Pearl Harbor.[71]\\r\\nIn 1992, 2000, and 2001, Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory's submersibles found the wreck of the fifth midget submarine lying in three parts outside Pearl Harbor. The wreck was in the debris field where much surplus U.S. equipment was dumped after the war, including vehicles and landing craft. Both of its torpedoes were missing. This correlates with reports of two torpedoes fired at the light cruiser St. Louis at 10:04 at the entrance of Pearl Harbor, and a possible torpedo fired at destroyer Helm at 08:21.[72]\\r\\nThe attack took place before any formal declaration of war was made by Japan, but this was not Admiral Yamamoto's intention. He originally stipulated that the attack should not commence until thirty minutes after Japan had informed the United States that peace negotiations were at an end.[citation needed] However, the attack began before the notice could be delivered. Tokyo transmitted the 5000-word notification (commonly called the \\"14-Part Message\\") in two blocks to the Japanese Embassy in Washington. Transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it on schedule; in the event, it was not presented until more than an hour after the attack began. (In fact, U.S. code breakers had already deciphered and translated most of the message hours before he was scheduled to deliver it.)[73] The final part is sometimes described as a declaration of war. While it was viewed by a number of senior U.S government and military officials as a very strong indicator negotiations were likely to be terminated[74] and that war might break out at any moment,[75] it neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations. A declaration of war was printed on the front page of Japan's newspapers in the evening edition of December 8,[76] but not delivered to the U.S. government until the day after the attack.\\r\\nFor decades, conventional wisdom held that Japan attacked without first formally breaking diplomatic relations only because of accidents and bumbling that delayed the delivery of a document hinting at war to Washington. In 1999, however, Takeo Iguchi, a professor of law and international relations at International Christian University in Tokyo, discovered documents that pointed to a vigorous debate inside the government over how, and indeed whether, to notify Washington of Japan's intention to break off negotiations and start a war, including a December 7 entry in the war diary saying, \\"[O]ur deceptive diplomacy is steadily proceeding toward success.\\" Of this, Iguchi said, \\"The diary shows that the army and navy did not want to give any proper declaration of war, or indeed prior notice even of the termination of negotiations?... and they clearly prevailed.\\"[77][78]\\r\\nIn any event, even if the Japanese had decoded and delivered the 14-Part Message before the beginning of the attack, it would not have constituted either a formal break of diplomatic relations or a declaration of war. The final two paragraphs of the message read:\\r\\nThus the earnest hope of the Japanese Government to adjust Japanese-American relations and to preserve and promote the peace of the Pacific through cooperation with the American Government has finally been lost.\\r\\nThe first attack wave of 183 planes was launched north of Oahu, led by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida.[80] Six planes failed to launch due to technical difficulties.[61] It included:[nb 11]\\r\\nAs the first wave approached Oahu, it was detected by the U.S. Army SCR-270 radar at Opana Point near the island's northern tip. This post had been in training mode for months, but was not yet operational.[83] The operators, Privates George Elliot Jr. and Joseph Lockard, reported a target.[84] But Lieutenant Kermit A. Tyler, a newly assigned officer at the thinly manned Intercept Center, presumed it was the scheduled arrival of six B-17 bombers from California. The Japanese planes were approaching from a direction very close (only a few degrees difference) to the bombers,[85] and while the operators had never seen a formation as large on radar, they neglected to tell Tyler of its size.[86] Tyler, for security reasons, could not tell the operators of the six B-17s that were due (even though it was widely known).[86]\\r\\nAs the first wave planes approached Oahu, they encountered and shot down several U.S. aircraft. At least one of these radioed a somewhat incoherent warning. Other warnings from ships off the harbor entrance were still being processed or awaiting confirmation when the attacking planes began bombing and strafing. Nevertheless, it is not clear any warnings would have had much effect even if they had been interpreted correctly and much more promptly. The results the Japanese achieved in the Philippines were essentially the same as at Pearl Harbor, though MacArthur had almost nine hours warning that the Japanese had already attacked Pearl Harbor.\\r\\nThe air portion of the attack began at 7:48?a.m. Hawaiian Time[16] (3:18?a.m. December 8 Japanese Standard Time, as kept by ships of the Kido Butai),[87][nb 3] with the attack on Kaneohe. A total of 353[17] Japanese planes in two waves reached Oahu. Slow, vulnerable torpedo bombers led the first wave, exploiting the first moments of surprise to attack the most important ships present (the battleships), while dive bombers attacked U.S. air bases across Oahu, starting with Hickam Field, the largest, and Wheeler Field, the main U.S. Army Air Forces fighter base. The 171 planes in the second wave attacked the Army Air Forces' Bellows Field near Kaneohe on the windward side of the island, and Ford Island. The only aerial opposition came from a handful of P-36 Hawks, P-40 Warhawks, and some SBD Dauntless dive bombers from the carrier Enterprise.[nb 12]\\r\\nIn the first wave attack, about eight of the forty-nine 800?kg (1760?lb) armor-piercing bombs dropped hit their intended battleship targets. At least two of those bombs broke up on impact, another detonated before penetrating an unarmored deck, and one was a dud. Thirteen of the forty torpedoes hit battleships, and four torpedoes hit other ships.[88] Men aboard U.S. ships awoke to the sounds of alarms, bombs exploding, and gunfire, prompting bleary-eyed men to dress as they ran to General Quarters stations. (The famous message, \\"Air raid Pearl Harbor. This is not drill.\\",[nb 13] was sent from the headquarters of Patrol Wing Two, the first senior Hawaiian command to respond.) The defenders were very unprepared. Ammunition lockers were locked, aircraft parked wingtip to wingtip in the open to prevent sabotage,[89] guns unmanned (none of the Navy's 5\\"/38s, only a quarter of its machine guns, and only four of 31 Army batteries got in action).[89] Despite this low alert status, many American military personnel responded effectively during the attack.[nb 14] Ensign Joe Taussig Jr., aboard Nevada, commanded the ship's antiaircraft guns and was severely wounded, but continued to be on post. Lt. Commander F. J. Thomas commanded Nevada in the captain's absence and got her under way until the ship was grounded at 9:10?a.m.[90] One of the destroyers, Aylwin, got underway with only four officers aboard, all ensigns, none with more than a year's sea duty; she operated at sea for 36 hours before her commanding officer managed to get back aboard.[91] Captain Mervyn Bennion, commanding West Virginia, led his men until he was cut down by fragments from a bomb which hit Tennessee, moored alongside.\\r\\nThe second planned wave consisted of 171 planes: 54 B5Ns, 81 D3As, and 36 A6Ms, commanded by Lieutenant-Commander Shigekazu Shimazaki.[81] Four planes failed to launch because of technical difficulties.[61] This wave and its targets comprised:[81]\\r\\nThe second wave was divided into three groups. One was tasked to attack Kne?ohe, the rest Pearl Harbor proper. The separate sections arrived at the attack point almost simultaneously from several directions.\\r\\nNinety minutes after it began, the attack was over. Two thousand and eight sailors were killed, and 710 others wounded; 218 soldiers and airmen (who were part of the Army until the independent U.S. Air Force was formed in 1947) were killed and 364 wounded; 109 marines were killed and 69 wounded; and 68 civilians were killed and 35 wounded. In total, 2,403 Americans died and 1,178 were wounded.[92][self-published source] Eighteen ships were sunk or run aground, including five battleships.[10][93] All of the Americans killed or wounded during the attack were non-combatants, given the fact there was no state of war when the attack occurred.[23][24][94]\\r\\nOf the American fatalities, nearly half were due to the explosion of Arizona's forward magazine after it was hit by a modified 16-inch (410?mm) shell.[nb 15]\\r\\nAlready damaged by a torpedo and on fire amidships, Nevada attempted to exit the harbor. She was targeted by many Japanese bombers as she got under way and sustained more hits from 250?lb (113?kg) bombs, which started further fires. She was deliberately beached to avoid blocking the harbor entrance.\\r\\nCalifornia was hit by two bombs and two torpedoes. The crew might have kept her afloat, but were ordered to abandon ship just as they were raising power for the pumps. Burning oil from Arizona and West Virginia drifted down on her, and probably made the situation look worse than it was. The disarmed target ship Utah was holed twice by torpedoes. West Virginia was hit by seven torpedoes, the seventh tearing away her rudder. Oklahoma was hit by four torpedoes, the last two above her belt armor, which caused her to capsize. Maryland was hit by two of the converted 16\\" shells, but neither caused serious damage.\\r\\nAlthough the Japanese concentrated on battleships (the largest vessels present), they did not ignore other targets. The light cruiser Helena was torpedoed, and the concussion from the blast capsized the neighboring minelayer Oglala. Two destroyers in dry dock, Cassin and Downes were destroyed when bombs penetrated their fuel bunkers. The leaking fuel caught fire; flooding the dry dock in an effort to fight fire made the burning oil rise, and both were burned out. Cassin slipped from her keel blocks and rolled against Downes. The light cruiser Raleigh was holed by a torpedo. The light cruiser Honolulu was damaged, but remained in service. The repair vessel Vestal, moored alongside Arizona, was heavily damaged and beached. The seaplane tender Curtiss was also damaged. The destroyer Shaw was badly damaged when two bombs penetrated her forward magazine.[95]\\r\\nOf the 402[17] American aircraft in Hawaii, 188 were destroyed and 159 damaged,[17] 155 of them on the ground. Almost none were actually ready to take off to defend the base. Eight Army Air Forces pilots managed to get airborne during the attack[96] and six were credited with downing at least one Japanese aircraft during the attack: 1st Lt. Lewis M. Sanders, 2nd Lt. Philip M. Rasmussen, 2nd Lt. Kenneth M. Taylor, 2nd Lt. George S. Welch, 2nd Lt. Harry W. Brown, and 2nd Lt. Gordon H. Sterling Jr. Sterling was shot down by Lt. Fujita over Kaneohe Bay and is listed as Body Not Recovered (not Missing In Action). Lt. John L. Dains was killed by friendly fire returning from a victory over Kaawa.[97][98] Of 33 PBYs in Hawaii, 24 were destroyed, and six others damaged beyond repair. (The three on patrol returned undamaged.) Friendly fire brought down some U.S. planes on top of that, including five from an inbound flight from Enterprise. Japanese attacks on barracks killed additional personnel.\\r\\nAt the time of the attack, nine civilian aircraft were flying in the vicinity of Pearl Harbor. Of these, three were shot down.[92]\\r\\nFifty-five Japanese airmen and nine submariners were killed in the attack, and one was captured. Of Japan's 414[81] available planes, 29 were lost during the battle (nine in the first attack wave, 20 in the second),[99][nb 16] with another 74 damaged by antiaircraft fire from the ground.\\r\\nSeveral Japanese junior officers including Fuchida and Genda urged Nagumo to carry out a third strike in order to destroy as much of Pearl Harbor's fuel and torpedo[nb 17] storage, maintenance, and dry dock facilities as possible.[100] Genda, who had unsuccessfully advocated for invading Hawaii after the air attack, believed that without an invasion, three strikes were necessary to disable the base as much as possible.[101] The captains of the other five carriers in the task force reported they were willing and ready to carry out a third strike.[102] Military historians have suggested the destruction of these shore facilities would have hampered the U.S. Pacific Fleet far more seriously than the loss of its battleships.[103] If they had been wiped out, \\"serious [American] operations in the Pacific would have been postponed for more than a year\\";[104] according to Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, later Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet, \\"it would have prolonged the war another two years.\\"[105] Nagumo, however, decided to withdraw for several reasons:\\r\\nAt a conference aboard his flagship the following morning, Yamamoto supported Nagumo's withdrawal without launching a third wave.[110] In retrospect, sparing the vital dockyards, maintenance shops, and the oil tank farm meant the U.S. could respond relatively quickly to Japanese activities in the Pacific. Yamamoto later regretted Nagumo's decision to withdraw and categorically stated it had been a great mistake not to order a third strike.[112]\\r\\nSeventeen ships were damaged or lost in the attack, of which fourteen were repaired and returned to service.[113]\\r\\nAfter a systematic search for survivors, formal salvage operations began. Captain Homer N. Wallin, Material Officer for Commander, Battle Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, was immediately ordered to lead salvage operations. \\"Within a short time I was relieved of all other duties and ordered to full time work as Fleet Salvage Officer.\\"[115][nb 18]\\r\\nAround Pearl Harbor, divers from the Navy (shore and tenders), the Naval Shipyard, and civilian contractors (Pacific Bridge and others) began work on the ships that could be refloated. They patched holes, cleared debris, and pumped water out of ships. Navy divers worked inside the damaged ships. Within six months, five battleships and two cruisers were patched or refloated so they could be sent to shipyards in Pearl Harbor and on the mainland for extensive repair.\\r\\nIntensive salvage operations continued for another year, a total of some 20,000 man-hours under water.[117] Oklahoma, while successfully raised, was never repaired, and capsized while under tow to the mainland in 1947. Arizona and the target ship Utah were too heavily damaged for salvage, though much of their armament and equipment was removed and put to use aboard other vessels. Today, the two hulks remain where they were sunk,[118] with Arizona becoming a war memorial.\\r\\nIn the wake of the attack, 15 Medals of Honor, 51 Navy Crosses, 53 Silver Stars, four Navy and Marine Corps Medals, one Distinguished Flying Cross, four Distinguished Service Crosses, one Distinguished Service Medal, and three Bronze Star Medals were awarded to the American servicemen who distinguished themselves in combat at Pearl Harbor.[119] Additionally, a special military award, the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Medal, was later authorized for all military veterans of the attack.\\r\\nThe day after the attack, Roosevelt delivered his famous Infamy Speech to a Joint Session of Congress, calling for a formal declaration of war on the Empire of Japan. Congress obliged his request less than an hour later. On December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, even though the Tripartite Pact did not require it.[nb 19] Congress issued a declaration of war against Germany and Italy later that same day. The UK actually declared war on Japan nine hours before the U.S. did, partially due to Japanese attacks on Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong, and partially due to Winston Churchill's promise to declare war \\"within the hour\\" of a Japanese attack on the United States.[120]\\r\\nThe attack was an initial shock to all the Allies in the Pacific Theater. Further losses compounded the alarming setback. Japan attacked the Philippines hours later (because of the time difference, it was December 8 in the Philippines). Only three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the battleships Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk off the coast of Malaya, causing British Prime Minister Winston Churchill later to recollect \\"In all the war I never received a more direct shock. As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me. There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California. Over this vast expanse of waters Japan was supreme and we everywhere were weak and naked\\".[121]\\r\\nThroughout the war, Pearl Harbor was frequently used in American propaganda.[122]\\r\\nOne further consequence of the attack on Pearl Harbor and its aftermath (notably the Niihau incident) was that Japanese American residents and citizens were relocated to nearby Japanese-American internment camps. Within hours of the attack, hundreds of Japanese American leaders were rounded up and brought to high-security camps such as Sand Island at the mouth of Honolulu harbor and Kilauea Military Camp on the island of Hawaii.[123][124] Eventually, more than 110,000 Japanese Americans, nearly all who lived on the West Coast, were forced into interior camps, but in Hawaii, where the 150,000-plus Japanese Americans composed over one-third of the population, only 1,200 to 1,800 were interned.[125][126][127]\\r\\nThe attack also had international consequences. The Canadian province of British Columbia, bordering the Pacific Ocean, had long had a large population of Japanese immigrants and their Japanese Canadian descendants. Pre-war tensions were exacerbated by the Pearl Harbor attack, leading to a reaction from the Government of Canada. On February 24, 1942, Order-in-Council P.C. no. 1486 was passed under the War Measures Act allowing for the forced removal of any and all Canadians of Japanese descent from British Columbia, as well as the prohibiting them from returning to the province. On 4 March, regulations under the Act were adopted to evacuate Japanese-Canadians.[128] As a result, 12,000 were interned in interior camps, 2,000 were sent to road camps and another 2,000 were forced to work in the prairies at sugar beet farms.[129]\\r\\nThe Japanese planners had determined that some means was required for rescuing fliers whose aircraft were too badly damaged to return to the carriers. The island of Niihau, only 30 minutes flying time from Pearl Harbor, was designated as the rescue point.\\r\\nThe Zero flown by Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi of Hiryu was damaged in the attack on Wheeler, so he flew to the rescue point on Niihau. The aircraft was further damaged on landing. Nishikaichi was helped from the wreckage by one of the native Hawaiians, who, aware of the tension between the United States and Japan, took the pilot's maps and other documents. The island's residents had no telephones or radio and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Nishikaichi enlisted the support of three Japanese-American residents in an attempt to recover the documents. During the ensuing struggles, Nishikaichi was killed and a Hawaiian civilian was wounded; one collaborator committed suicide, and his wife and the third collaborator were sent to prison.\\r\\nThe ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents had apparently gone to the assistance of Nishikaichi was a source of concern for many, and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted.[130]\\r\\nAdmiral Hara Tadaichi summed up the Japanese result by saying, \\"We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war.\\"[131] To a similar effect, see Isoroku Yamamoto's alleged \\"sleeping giant\\" quote.\\r\\nWhile the attack accomplished its intended objective, it turned out to be largely unnecessary. Unbeknownst to Yamamoto, who conceived the original plan, the U.S. Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon 'charging' across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war (in keeping with the evolution of Plan Orange).[32] The U.S. instead adopted \\"Plan Dog\\" in 1940, which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia, while the U.S. concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany.[132]\\r\\nFortunately for the United States, the American aircraft carriers were untouched by the Japanese attack; otherwise the Pacific Fleet's ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or more (given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet). As it was, the elimination of the battleships left the U.S. Navy with no choice but to rely on its aircraft carriers and submarinesthe very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance. While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service, their relatively low speed and high fuel consumption limited their deployment, and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles (their only major action being the Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944). A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan. As a result, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded battleships for a \\"decisive battle\\" that never happened.[133]\\r\\nThe Japanese confidence in their ability to achieve a short, victorious war meant that they neglected Pearl Harbor's navy repair yards, oil tank farms, submarine base, and old headquarters building.[56] All of these targets were omitted from Genda's list, yet they proved more important than any battleship to the American war efforts in the Pacific. The survival of the repair shops and fuel depots allowed Pearl Harbor to maintain logistical support to the U.S. Navy's operations,[134][135] such as the Battles of Coral Sea and Midway. It was submarines that immobilized the Imperial Japanese Navy's heavy ships and brought Japan's economy to a virtual standstill by crippling the transportation of oil and raw materials: by the end of 1942, import of raw materials was cut to half of what it had been, \\"to a disastrous ten million tons\\", while oil import \\"was almost completely stopped\\".[nb 20] Lastly, the basement of the Old Administration Building was the home of the cryptanalytic unit which contributed significantly to the Midway ambush and the Submarine Force's success.[136]\\r\\nEver since the Japanese attack, there has been debate as to how and why the United States had been caught unaware, and how much and when American officials knew of Japanese plans and related topics. Military officers including Gen. Billy Mitchell had pointed out the vulnerability of Pearl to air attack. At least two naval war games, one in 1932 and another in 1936, proved that Pearl was vulnerable to such an attack. Admiral James Richardson was removed from command shortly after protesting President Roosevelt's decision to move the bulk of the Pacific fleet to Pearl Harbor.[137][138] The decisions of military and political leadership to ignore these warnings has contributed to conspiracy theories. Several writers, including journalist Robert Stinnett and former United States Rear Admiral Robert Alfred Theobald, have argued that various parties high in the U.S. and British governments knew of the attack in advance and may even have let it happen or encouraged it in order to force the U.S. into war via the so-called \\"back door\\". However, this conspiracy theory is rejected by mainstream historians.[139][140][141][142][nb 21]\\r\\nInformational notes\\r\\nCitations\\r\\nBibliography\\r\\nFurther reading\\r\\nAccounts\\r\\nMedia\\r\\nHistorical documents","input":"How many were killed in the attack on pearl harbor?"},{"output":"over Mach 1.6","context":"","input":"What is the top speed of the f-35?"},{"output":"the community or local congregations of Christians living in each city, and not merely to the building or buildings in which they gathered for worship","context":"The Seven Churches of Revelation, also known as the Seven Churches of the Apocalypse and the Seven Churches of Asia, are seven major churches of Early Christianity, as mentioned in the New Testament Book of Revelation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Revelation 1:11, on the Greek island of Patmos, Jesus Christ instructs John of Patmos to: \\"Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamum, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"churches\\" in this context refers to the community or local congregations of Christians living in each city, and not merely to the building or buildings in which they gathered for worship.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seven Churches are named for their locations. The Book of Revelation provides descriptions of each Church.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letters follow a common pattern. For example: the Lord first addresses each church and identifies himself,[4] then defines things that he knows about the church in question.[5] After this, a challenge or reproach is given,[6] followed by a promise.[7] In all seven cases the admonition is included, \\"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches\\",[8] although sometimes this comes before the promise and sometimes after.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the letters differ in length in accord with the needs of each community, all conclude with an appeal to hold fast and to listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. Each church is promised that everyone who conquers will be rewarded by Christ.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome historicists typically interpret the seven churches as representing seven different periods in the history of the Western Church from the time of Paul until the return of Jesus Christ.[9] Scofield states that \\"these messages by their very terms go beyond the local assemblies mentioned.\\"[10] He is of the opinion that the letters have a prophetic purpose disclosing the seven phases of the spiritual history of the Church. Other writers, such as Clarence Larkin,[11] Henry Hampton Halley,[12] Merrill Unger,[13] and William M. Branham[14] also have posited the view that the seven churches preview the history of the global Church.\\r\\n\\r\\n Historicism has been criticized by the Eastern Orthodox Fr. Dimitri Cozby, who writes that historicists take a greatly oversimplified view of church history: \\"Since dispensationalism is Protestant in origin its 'Church history' is strictly Western. The dispensations take into account almost nothing of Orthodox history after the period of the early councils which we share with the West.\\"[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nChapters 2-3 of the Revelation have specific messages for each of the seven churches. The message of each of the seven letters is directed to the angel of the particular church that is mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrigen[16] explains that these \\"angels\\" are the guardian angels of the churches, a view upheld by Henry Alford. But Epiphanius[17] explicitly rejects this view, and, in accordance with the imagery of the passage, explains it as the bishops.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn sees a vision of the Son of man, who walks among seven lampstands and has seven stars in his right hand. Revelation 1:20 states that \\"The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.\\" The comparison of a teacher to a star is scriptural.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAugustine of Hippo's reason for interpreting angels of the churches as the prelates of the church is that St. John speaks of them as falling from their first charity, which is not true of the angels.[19][20] Others would say that the falling away relates to the churches, not to the messengers, as each of the seven letters conclude with the words \\"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe Amplified Bible states that Revelation 2:2 through to 3:18, your and you are in the singular, referring to the angel of each church. Much of what is said is rebuke and admonishment, so if the angels are heavenly beings, they may serve in some way as representatives of the sinful people in their churches. Jewish tradition maintained that every nation and individual has a guardian angel, and that when God is about to punish a nation, He first punishes its angel. There is even a story of Michael, the guardian angel of Israel, being rebuked by God for the sins committed in the time of Ezekiel. So the original readers of Revelation might have assumed that the angels here are the guardian angels of the individual churches, sharing responsibility for the actions of the members.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the New Testament, the Greek word for angels (?ۚ?) is not only used for heavenly angels, but also used for human messengers, such as John the Baptist (Matthew 11:10,Mark 1:2,Luke 7:27) and God's prophets (Revelation 22:8-9)[21] C.I. Scofield has noted that \\"The natural explanation of the 'messengers' is that they were men sent by the seven churches to ascertain the state of the aged apostle ... but they figure any who bear God's messages to a church.\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\n?This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:?Herbermann, Charles, ed.

They are located in Las Vegas, and are named for Area 51 which is located near Rachel, Nevada, about 80 miles north of Las Vegas. The team logo jokingly depicts one of the grey aliens thought by UFO believers to inhabit that base. They play at Cashman Field which has a capacity of 9,334?people. The 51s won the PCL championship as the Stars in 1986 and 1988.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team has plans to move into Las Vegas Ballpark, a new 10,000-seat facility located in Summerlin, in 2019. Along with playing in a new ballpark, the 51s plan to rebrand by adopting a new name and logos after the 2018 season.  [1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team's first affiliation was with the San Diego Padres from 1983 to 2000. In 2001, they became the top farm club of the Los Angeles Dodgers. That affiliation ended at the conclusion of the 2008 season, when the 51s signed on with the Toronto Blue Jays. The New York Mets became affiliated with the 51s after the Blue Jays and Buffalo Bisons, with whom the Mets had been affiliated since 2009, struck an agreement; since the 51s were the only other unaffiliated team the Mets moved their Triple-A club cross country.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 24, 2008, Mandalay Baseball Properties sold the 51s franchise to Stevens Baseball Group.[3] There were no plans to move the team,[4] and talks of building a new stadium became stagnant.[5][6] The team has sold about 5,000 tickets per game on average the last few years,[7] but far fewer fans typically attend home games.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2011, Stevens Baseball Group came to an agreement to sell the 51s to Chris Milam's Silver State Baseball Group, LLC, with plans to move the team to a new ballpark at his proposed Las Vegas National Sports Center.[9] The plans came to nothing and Milam \\"walked away\\" from the baseball deal.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2013, the team was purchased by Summerlin Las Vegas Baseball Club LLC, a joint venture of Howard Hughes Corp and Play Ball Owners Group, including investors Steve Mack, Bart Wear, and Chris Kaempfer, with intentions of moving it to a proposed stadium in Summerlin near the Red Rock Resort Spa and Casino.[11] In October 2017, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority approved a 20-year, $80 million naming rights agreement to help pay for a new $150 million 10,000-seat ballpark which could open in 2019. Las Vegas Ballpark, located Summerlin, is expected to include 22 suites, a center field pool, kids' zone, and several bars.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Las Vegas 51s originally began as the second incarnation of the Portland Beavers baseball club, who reentered the Pacific Coast League after a two-year hiatus.  In 1973, the team moved to Spokane, Washington, and were renamed the Indians.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe franchise moved once again in 1983, becoming the Las Vegas Stars. The Stars became the first professional sports team to play in Las Vegas since the Las Vegas Wranglers baseball club who played from 1947ÿ52 and 1957ÿ58. The Stars inaugural season was quite successful, posting an 83ÿ60 record and winning the first half championship for the Southern Division leading to a playoff berth, eventually losing to the Albuquerque Dukes.  The following season, the Stars posted another successful campaign going 71ÿ65 and winning their second division championship (first half), but ultimately losing in the league semifinals to the Hawaii Islanders.  After a dismal '85 campaign, the Stars returned to their winning ways posting an 80ÿ62 record and winning the second half of the Southern Division.  In the league semifinals, the Stars defeated the Phoenix Firebirds 3-2 and went on to win their first PCL Championship, defeating the Vancouver Canadians in five games.  The Stars won their second PCL Championship two years later, once again defeating Vancouver, this time in four games.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter winning five division titles and two league championships in their first six years, the Stars hit a huge skid, posting a .500 or better record four times and winning shares of only two division championships in the following 12 years.  The Stars were unable to advance past the first round of the playoffs in both seasons that they qualified.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, after 18 years as the San Diego Padres top affiliate, the two teams parted ways.  The Stars then affiliated with the Los Angeles Dodgers, whose Triple-A affiliate, the Albuquerque Dukes, moved to Portland, Oregon to become the fourth incarnation of the Beavers.  The Stars decided to rebrand their entire operation, renaming the team the 51s as a reference to Area 51, a military base located north-northwest of Las Vegas legendary for rumors of its housing UFOs and other extraterrestrial technology.  The team adopted a logo featuring a grey alien head and introduced a mascot, Cosmo.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven with a new affiliate, a new name and a new look, the 51s did not improve on the field. The 51s have posted only four winning seasons since the name change. Their only division title came in 2002 as the team posted the best record in the league at 85ÿ59, but they lost to the eventual PCL champion Edmonton Trappers three games to one.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring their eight years together, the Dodgers and the 51s had a very rocky relationship. The Dodgers were not pleased with Cashman Field, which barely met the standards for Triple-A baseball. It had no weight room or indoor batting cages, and it was decrepit compared to other stadiums in the league. Citing the inadequacies of Cashman Field and lack of planning for a replacement, Los Angeles decided not to renew their player development contract (PDC) with Las Vegas after the 2008 season, opting to re-affiliate with Albuquerque.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the departure of the Los Angeles Dodgers, the 51s signed a two-year PDC with the Toronto Blue Jays, marking the first time that the 51s have been affiliated with an American League club.  This ended Toronto's 30-year affiliation with the Syracuse Chiefs based in upstate New York.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the 2008 season, Mandalay Baseball Properties sold the team to Stevens Baseball Group.[15]  The new president, Derek Stevens, stated that he planned to keep the team in Las Vegas but that he wanted to change the team's name in time for the 2009 season. Due to the length of time it took to secure a new PDC, the team missed the deadline set by Minor League Baseball for name and logo changes. Since then, the 51s have not made any public attempts at changing the team's name.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the 2010 season, the Toronto Blue Jays signed a two-year contract extension with the Las Vegas 51s, stating that the team was pleased to continue their relationship with the organization.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2013, the team was purchased by Summerlin Las Vegas Baseball Club LLC, a joint venture of Howard Hughes Corp. and Play Ball Owners Group, including investors Steve Mack, Bart Wear and Chris Kaempfer, with intentions of moving it to a new proposed stadium in Summerlin near the Red Rock Resort Spa and Casino.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 17, 2012, the 51s signed a Player Development Contract with the New York Mets for the 2013 and 2014 seasons.[18] On August 28, 2014, the Mets announced that they have extended their deal with Las Vegas through the 2016 season.  In late 2017, it was announced that the 2018 season will be the last as an affiliate of the Mets as the team will move its affiliation to the Syracuse Chiefs.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction on the new Summerlin ballpark began in 2018 and will be completed for the 2019 season.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Las Vegas 51s are covered by Las Vegas' two daily newspapers, the Las Vegas Review-Journal and Las Vegas Sun.

Generally, within one row (period) the elements are metals on the left, and non-metals on the right, with the elements having similar chemical behaviours being placed in the same column. Table rows are commonly called periods and columns are called groups. Six groups have accepted names as well as assigned numbers: for example, group 17 elements are halogens; and group 18 are noble gases. Also displayed are four simple rectangular areas or blocks associated with the filling of different atomic orbitals.\\r\\nImportantly, the organization of the periodic table can be utilized to derive relationships between various element properties, but also predicted chemical properties and behaviours of undiscovered or newly synthesized elements. Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev was first to publish a recognizable periodic table in 1869, developed mainly to illustrate periodic trends of the then-known elements. He also predicted some properties of unidentified elements that were expected to fill gaps within this table. Most of his forecasts proved to be correct. Mendeleev's idea has been slowly expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and by developing new theoretical models to explain chemical behaviour. The modern periodic table now provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical reactions, and continues to be widely adopted in chemistry, nuclear physics and other sciences.\\r\\nAll elements ranging from atomic numbers 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (oganesson) have been either discovered or synthesized, completing the first seven rows of the periodic table.[1][2] The first 98 elements exist naturally, although some are found only in trace amounts and were synthesized in laboratories before being found in nature.[n 1] Atomic numbers for elements 99 to 118 have only been synthesized in laboratories or nuclear reactors.[3] The synthesis of elements having higher atomic numbers is currently being pursued: these elements would begin an eighth row, and theoretical work has been done to suggest possible appearances for this extension. Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n1?(red)=Gas?3?(black)=Solid?80?(green)=Liquid?109?(gray)=Unknown?Color of the atomic number shows state of matter (at 0?C and 1?atm)\\r\\nBackground color shows subcategory in the metalÿmetalloidÿnonmetal trend:\\r\\nEach chemical element has a unique atomic number (Z) representing the number of protons in its nucleus.[n 2] Most elements have differing numbers of neutrons among different atoms, with these variants being referred to as isotopes. For example, carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: all of its atoms have six protons and most have six neutrons as well, but about one per cent have seven neutrons, and a very small fraction have eight neutrons. Isotopes are never separated in the periodic table; they are always grouped together under a single element. Elements with no stable isotopes have the atomic masses of their most stable isotopes, where such masses are shown, listed in parentheses.[6]\\r\\nIn the standard periodic table, the elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number Z (the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom). A new row (period) is started when a new electron shell has its first electron. Columns (groups) are determined by the electron configuration of the atom; elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns (e.g. oxygen and selenium are in the same column because they both have four electrons in the outermost p-subshell). Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table, although in the f-block, and to some respect in the d-block, the elements in the same period tend to have similar properties, as well. Thus, it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it.[7]\\r\\nAs of 2016[update], the periodic table has 118 confirmed elements, from element 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (oganesson). Elements 113, 115, 117 and 118, the most recent discoveries, were officially confirmed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in December 2015. Their proposed names, nihonium (Nh), moscovium (Mc), tennessine (Ts) and oganesson (Og) respectively, were announced by the IUPAC in June 2016 and made official in November 2016.[8][9][10][11]\\r\\nThe first 94 elements occur naturally; the remaining 24, americium to oganesson (95ÿ118), occur only when synthesized in laboratories. Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, 83 are primordial and 11 occur only in decay chains of primordial elements.[3] No element heavier than einsteinium (element 99) has ever been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, nor has astatine (element 85); francium (element 87) has been only photographed in the form of light emitted from microscopic quantities (300,000 atoms).[12]\\r\\nA group or family is a vertical column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell.[13] Consequently, elements in the same group tend to have a shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number.[14] In some parts of the periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.[15][16][17]\\r\\nUnder an international naming convention, the groups are numbered numerically from 1 to 18 from the leftmost column (the alkali metals) to the rightmost column (the noble gases).[18] Previously, they were known by roman numerals. In America, the roman numerals were followed by either an \\"A\\" if the group was in the s- or p-block, or a \\"B\\" if the group was in the d-block. The roman numerals used correspond to the last digit of today's naming convention (e.g. the group 4 elements were group IVB, and the group 14 elements were group IVA). In Europe, the lettering was similar, except that \\"A\\" was used if the group was before group 10, and \\"B\\" was used for groups including and after group 10. In addition, groups 8, 9 and 10 used to be treated as one triple-sized group, known collectively in both notations as group VIII. In 1988, the new IUPAC naming system was put into use, and the old group names were deprecated.[19]\\r\\nSome of these groups have been given trivial (unsystematic) names, as seen in the table below, although some are rarely used. Groups 3ÿ10 have no trivial names and are referred to simply by their group numbers or by the name of the first member of their group (such as \\"the scandium group\\" for group 3), since they display fewer similarities and/or vertical trends.[18]\\r\\nElements in the same group tend to show patterns in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because it is easier to remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus.[20] There are exceptions to these trends: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.[21]\\r\\nA period is a horizontal row in the periodic table. Although groups generally have more significant periodic trends, there are regions where horizontal trends are more significant than vertical group trends, such as the f-block, where the lanthanides and actinides form two substantial horizontal series of elements.[23]\\r\\nElements in the same period show trends in atomic radius, ionization energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity. Moving left to right across a period, atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron, which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus.[24] This decrease in atomic radius also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving from left to right across a period. The more tightly bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an electron. Electronegativity increases in the same manner as ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus.[20] Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a period. Metals (left side of a period) generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of a period), with the exception of the noble gases.[25]\\r\\nSpecific regions of the periodic table can be referred to as blocks in recognition of the sequence in which the electron shells of the elements are filled. Each block is named according to the subshell in which the \\"last\\" electron notionally resides.[26][n 3] The s-block comprises the first two groups (alkali metals and alkaline earth metals) as well as hydrogen and helium. The p-block comprises the last six groups, which are groups 13 to 18 in IUPAC group numbering (3A?to 8A in American group numbering) and contains, among other elements, all of the metalloids. The d-block comprises groups 3 to 12 (or?3B to 2B in American group numbering) and contains all of the transition metals. The f-block, often offset below the rest of the periodic table, has no group numbers and comprises lanthanides and actinides.[27]\\r\\nAccording to their shared physical and chemical properties, the elements can be classified into the major categories of metals, metalloids and nonmetals. Metals are generally shiny, highly conducting solids that form alloys with one another and salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals (other than noble gases). A majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless insulating gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals, feature covalent bonding. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.[28]\\r\\nMetal and nonmetals can be further classified into subcategories that show a gradation from metallic to non-metallic properties, when going left to right in the rows. The metals may be subdivided into the highly reactive alkali metals, through the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and actinides, via the archetypal transition metals, and ending in the physically and chemically weak post-transition metals. Nonmetals may be simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals, being nearer to the metalloids and show some incipient metallic character; the essentially nonmetallic diatomic nonmetals, nonmetallic and the almost completely inert, monatomic noble gases. Specialized groupings such as refractory metals and noble metals, are examples of subsets of transition metals, also known[29] and occasionally denoted.[30]\\r\\nPlacing elements into categories and subcategories based just on shared properties is imperfect. There is a large disparity of properties within each category with notable overlaps at the boundaries, as is the case with most classification schemes.[31] Beryllium, for example, is classified as an alkaline earth metal although its amphoteric chemistry and tendency to mostly form covalent compounds are both attributes of a chemically weak or post-transition metal. Radon is classified as a nonmetallic noble gas yet has some cationic chemistry that is characteristic of metals. Other classification schemes are possible such as the division of the elements into mineralogical occurrence categories, or crystalline structures. Categorizing the elements in this fashion dates back to at least 1869 when Hinrichs[32] wrote that simple boundary lines could be placed on the periodic table to show elements having shared properties, such as metals, nonmetals, or gaseous elements.\\r\\nThe electron configuration or organisation of electrons orbiting neutral atoms shows a recurring pattern or periodicity. The electrons occupy a series of electron shells (numbered 1, 2, and so on). Each shell consists of one or more subshells (named s, p, d, f and g). As atomic number increases, electrons progressively fill these shells and subshells more or less according to the Madelung rule or energy ordering rule, as shown in the diagram. The electron configuration for neon, for example, is 1s2 2s2 2p6. With an atomic number of ten, neon has two electrons in the first shell, and eight electrons in the second shell; there are two electrons in the s subshell and six in the p subshell. In periodic table terms, the first time an electron occupies a new shell corresponds to the start of each new period, these positions being occupied by hydrogen and the alkali metals.[33][34]\\r\\nSince the properties of an element are mostly determined by its electron configuration, the properties of the elements likewise show recurring patterns or periodic behaviour, some examples of which are shown in the diagrams below for atomic radii, ionization energy and electron affinity. It is this periodicity of properties, manifestations of which were noticed well before the underlying theory was developed, that led to the establishment of the periodic law (the properties of the elements recur at varying intervals) and the formulation of the first periodic tables.[33][34]\\r\\nAtomic radii vary in a predictable and explainable manner across the periodic table. For instance, the radii generally decrease along each period of the table, from the alkali metals to the noble gases; and increase down each group. The radius increases sharply between the noble gas at the end of each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period. These trends of the atomic radii (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can be explained by the electron shell theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of quantum theory.[35]\\r\\nThe electrons in the 4f-subshell, which is progressively filled across the lanthanide series, are not particularly effective at shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the sub-shells further out. The elements immediately following the lanthanides have atomic radii that are smaller than would be expected and that are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them.[36] Hence hafnium has virtually the same atomic radius (and chemistry) as zirconium, and tantalum has an atomic radius similar to niobium, and so forth. This is known as the lanthanide contraction. The effect of the lanthanide contraction is noticeable up to platinum (element 78), after which it is masked by a relativistic effect known as the inert pair effect.[37] The d-block contraction, which is a similar effect between the d-block and p-block, is less pronounced than the lanthanide contraction but arises from a similar cause.[36]\\r\\nThe first ionization energy is the energy it takes to remove one electron from an atom, the second ionization energy is the energy it takes to remove a second electron from the atom, and so on. For a given atom, successive ionization energies increase with the degree of ionization. For magnesium as an example, the first ionization energy is 738?kJ/mol and the second is 1450?kJ/mol. Electrons in the closer orbitals experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal requires increasingly more energy. Ionization energy becomes greater up and to the right of the periodic table.[37]\\r\\nLarge jumps in the successive molar ionization energies occur when removing an electron from a noble gas (complete electron shell) configuration. For magnesium again, the first two molar ionization energies of magnesium given above correspond to removing the two 3s electrons, and the third ionization energy is a much larger 7730?kJ/mol, for the removal of a 2p electron from the very stable neon-like configuration of Mg2+. Similar jumps occur in the ionization energies of other third-row atoms.[37]\\r\\nElectronegativity is the tendency of an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons.[38] An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance between the valence electrons and the nucleus. The higher its electronegativity, the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932.[39] In general, electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements,[n 5] while caesium is the least, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.[21]\\r\\nThere are some exceptions to this general rule. Gallium and germanium have higher electronegativities than aluminium and silicon respectively because of the d-block contraction. Elements of the fourth period immediately after the first row of the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the 3d-electrons are not effective at shielding the increased nuclear charge, and smaller atomic size correlates with higher electronegativity.[21] The anomalously high electronegativity of lead, particularly when compared to thallium and bismuth, appears to be an artifact of data selection and data availability. Methods of calculation other than the Pauling method show the normal periodic trends for these elements.[40]\\r\\nThe electron affinity of an atom is the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom to form a negative ion. Although electron affinity varies greatly, some patterns emerge. Generally, nonmetals have more positive electron affinity values than metals. Chlorine most strongly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been measured conclusively, so they may or may not have slightly negative values.[43]\\r\\nElectron affinity generally increases across a period. This is caused by the filling of the valence shell of the atom; a group 17 atom releases more energy than a group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence shell and is therefore more stable.[43]\\r\\nA trend of decreasing electron affinity going down groups would be expected. The additional electron will be entering an orbital farther away from the nucleus. As such this electron would be less attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added. In going down a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, this is due to the poor shielding by d and f electrons. A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.[44]\\r\\nThe lower the values of ionization energy, electronegativity and electron affinity, the more metallic character the element has. Conversely, nonmetallic character increases with higher values of these properties.[45] Given the periodic trends of these three properties, metallic character tends to decrease going across a period (or row) and, with some irregularities (mostly) due to poor screening of the nucleus by d and f electrons, and relativistic effects,[46] tends to increase going down a group (or column or family). Thus, the most metallic elements (such as caesium and francium) are found at the bottom left of traditional periodic tables and the most nonmetallic elements (oxygen, fluorine, chlorine) at the top right. The combination of horizontal and vertical trends in metallic character explains the stair-shaped dividing line between metals and nonmetals found on some periodic tables, and the practice of sometimes categorizing several elements adjacent to that line, or elements adjacent to those elements, as metalloids.[47][48]\\r\\nFrom left to right across the four blocks of the long- or 32-column form of the periodic table are a series of linking or bridging groups of elements, located approximately between each block.[49] These groups, like the metalloids, show properties in between, or that are a mixture of, groups to either side. Chemically, the group 3 elements, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and actinium behave largely like the alkaline earth metals[50] or, more generally, s block metals[51][52] but have some of the physical properties of d block transition metals.[53] Lutetium and lawrencium, at the end of the end of the f block, may constitute another linking or bridging group. Lutetium behaves chemically as a lanthanide but shows a mix of lanthanide and transition metal physical properties.[54][55] Lawrencium, as an analogue of lutetium, would presumable display like characteristics.[n 6] The coinage metals in group 11 (copper, silver, and gold) are chemically capable of acting as either transition metals or main group metals.[58] The volatile group 12 metals, zinc, cadmium and mercury are sometimes regarded as linking the d block to the p block. Notionally they are d block elements but they have few transition metal properties and are more like their p block neighbors in group 13.[59][60] The relatively inert noble gases, in group 18, bridge the most reactive groups of elements in the periodic tablethe halogens in group 17 and the alkali metals in group 1.[49]\\r\\nIn 1789, Antoine Lavoisier published a list of 33 chemical elements, grouping them into gases, metals, nonmetals, and earths.[61] Chemists spent the following century searching for a more precise classification scheme. In 1829, Johann Wolfgang D?bereiner observed that many of the elements could be grouped into triads based on their chemical properties. Lithium, sodium, and potassium, for example, were grouped together in a triad as soft, reactive metals. D?bereiner also observed that, when arranged by atomic weight, the second member of each triad was roughly the average of the first and the third;[62] this became known as the Law of Triads.[63] German chemist Leopold Gmelin worked with this system, and by 1843 he had identified ten triads, three groups of four, and one group of five. Jean-Baptiste Dumas published work in 1857 describing relationships between various groups of metals. Although various chemists were able to identify relationships between small groups of elements, they had yet to build one scheme that encompassed them all.[62]\\r\\nIn 1857, German chemist August Kekul observed that carbon often has four other atoms bonded to it. Methane, for example, has one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms.[64] This concept eventually became known as valency; different elements bond with different numbers of atoms.[65]\\r\\nIn 1862, Alexandre-Emile Bguyer de Chancourtois, a French geologist, published an early form of periodic table, which he called the telluric helix or screw. He was the first person to notice the periodicity of the elements. With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight, de Chancourtois showed that elements with similar properties seemed to occur at regular intervals. His chart included some ions and compounds in addition to elements. His paper also used geological rather than chemical terms and did not include a diagram; as a result, it received little attention until the work of Dmitri Mendeleev.[66]\\r\\nIn 1864, Julius Lothar Meyer, a German chemist, published a table with 44 elements arranged by valency. The table showed that elements with similar properties often shared the same valency.[67] Concurrently, English chemist William Odling published an arrangement of 57 elements, ordered on the basis of their atomic weights. With some irregularities and gaps, he noticed what appeared to be a periodicity of atomic weights among the elements and that this accorded with \\"their usually received groupings\\".[68] Odling alluded to the idea of a periodic law but did not pursue it.[69] He subsequently proposed (in 1870) a valence-based classification of the elements.[70]\\r\\nEnglish chemist John Newlands produced a series of papers from 1863 to 1866 noting that when the elements were listed in order of increasing atomic weight, similar physical and chemical properties recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music.[71][72] This so termed Law of Octaves was ridiculed by Newlands' contemporaries, and the Chemical Society refused to publish his work.[73] Newlands was nonetheless able to draft a table of the elements and used it to predict the existence of missing elements, such as germanium.[74] The Chemical Society only acknowledged the significance of his discoveries five years after they credited Mendeleev.[75]\\r\\nIn 1867, Gustavus Hinrichs, a Danish born academic chemist based in America, published a spiral periodic system based on atomic spectra and weights, and chemical similarities. His work was regarded as idiosyncratic, ostentatious and labyrinthine and this may have militated against its recognition and acceptance.[76][77]\\r\\nRussian chemistry professor Dmitri Mendeleev and German chemist Julius Lothar Meyer independently published their periodic tables in 1869 and 1870, respectively.[78] Mendeleev's table was his first published version; that of Meyer was an expanded version of his (Meyer's) table of 1864.[79] They both constructed their tables by listing the elements in rows or columns in order of atomic weight and starting a new row or column when the characteristics of the elements began to repeat.[80]\\r\\nThe recognition and acceptance afforded to Mendeleev's table came from two decisions he made. The first was to leave gaps in the table when it seemed that the corresponding element had not yet been discovered.[81] Mendeleev was not the first chemist to do so, but he was the first to be recognized as using the trends in his periodic table to predict the properties of those missing elements, such as gallium and germanium.[82] The second decision was to occasionally ignore the order suggested by the atomic weights and switch adjacent elements, such as tellurium and iodine, to better classify them into chemical families.\\r\\nMendeleev published in 1869, using atomic weight to organize the elements, information determinable to fair precision in his time. Atomic weight worked well enough to allow Mendeleev to accurately predict the properties of missing elements.\\r\\nFollowing the discovery, in 1911, by Ernest Rutherford of the atomic nucleus, it was proposed that the integer count of the nuclear charge is identical to the sequential place of each element in the periodic table. In 1913, Henry Moseley using X-ray spectroscopy confirmed this proposal experimentally. Moseley determined the value of the nuclear charge of each element, and showed that Mendeleev's ordering actually places the elements in sequential order by nuclear charge.[83] Nuclear charge is identical to proton count, and determines the value of the atomic number (Z) of each element. Using atomic number gives a definitive, integer-based sequence for the elements. Moseley predicted, in 1913, that the only elements still missing between aluminium (Z=13) and gold (Z=79) were Z = 43, 61, 72, and 75, all of which were later discovered. The atomic number is the absolute definition of an element, and gives a factual basis for the ordering of the periodic table. The periodic table is used to predict the properties of new synthetic elements before they are produced and studied.[84]\\r\\nIn 1871, Mendeleev published his periodic table in a new form, with groups of similar elements arranged in columns rather than in rows, and those columns numbered I to VIII corresponding with the element's oxidation state. He also gave detailed predictions for the properties of elements he had earlier noted were missing, but should exist.[85] These gaps were subsequently filled as chemists discovered additional naturally occurring elements.[86] It is often stated that the last naturally occurring element to be discovered was francium (referred to by Mendeleev as eka-caesium) in 1939.[87] Plutonium, produced synthetically in 1940, was identified in trace quantities as a naturally occurring element in 1971.[88]\\r\\nThe popular[89] periodic table layout, also known as the common or standard form (as shown at various other points in this article), is attributable to Horace Groves Deming. In 1923, Deming, an American chemist, published short (Mendeleev style) and medium (18-column) form periodic tables.[90][n 7] Merck and Company prepared a handout form of Deming's 18-column medium table, in 1928, which was widely circulated in American schools. By the 1930s Deming's table was appearing in handbooks and encyclopaedias of chemistry. It was also distributed for many years by the Sargent-Welch Scientific Company.[91][92][93]\\r\\nWith the development of modern quantum mechanical theories of electron configurations within atoms, it became apparent that each period (row) in the table corresponded to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons. Larger atoms have more electron sub-shells, so later tables have required progressively longer periods.[94]\\r\\nIn 1945, Glenn Seaborg, an American scientist, made the suggestion that the actinide elements, like the lanthanides, were filling an f sub-level. Before this time the actinides were thought to be forming a fourth d-block row. Seaborg's colleagues advised him not to publish such a radical suggestion as it would most likely ruin his career. As Seaborg considered he did not then have a career to bring into disrepute, he published anyway. Seaborg's suggestion was found to be correct and he subsequently went on to win the 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work in synthesizing actinide elements.[95][96][n 8]\\r\\nAlthough minute quantities of some transuranic elements occur naturally,[3] they were all first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, the first of these being neptunium, synthesized in 1939.[97] Because many of the transuranic elements are highly unstable and decay quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has priority, and hence naming rights.[98] In 2010, a joint RussiaÿUS collaboration at Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, claimed to have synthesized six atoms of tennessine (element 117), making it the most recently claimed discovery. It, along with nihonium (element 113), moscovium (element 115), and oganesson (element 118), are the four most recently named elements, whose names all became official on 28 November 2016.[99]\\r\\nThe modern periodic table is sometimes expanded into its long or 32-column form by reinstating the footnoted f-block elements into their natural position between the s- and d-blocks. Unlike the 18-column form this arrangement results in \\"no interruptions in the sequence of increasing atomic numbers\\".[100] The relationship of the f-block to the other blocks of the periodic table also becomes easier to see.[101] Jensen advocates a form of table with 32 columns on the grounds that the lanthanides and actinides are otherwise relegated in the minds of students as dull, unimportant elements that can be quarantined and ignored.[102] Despite these advantages the 32-column form is generally avoided by editors on account of its undue rectangular ratio (compared to a book page ratio),[103] and the familiarity of chemists with the modern form (as introduced by Seaborg).[104]\\r\\nWithin 100 years of the appearance of Mendeleev's table in 1869 it has been estimated that around 700 different periodic table versions were published.[105] As well as numerous rectangular variations, other periodic table formats have been shaped, for example,[n 9] like a circle, cube, cylinder, building, spiral, lemniscate,[106] octagonal prism, pyramid, sphere, or triangle. Such alternatives are often developed to highlight or emphasize chemical or physical properties of the elements that are not as apparent in traditional periodic tables.[105]\\r\\nA popular[107] alternative structure is that of Theodor Benfey (1960). The elements are arranged in a continuous spiral, with hydrogen at the centre and the transition metals, lanthanides, and actinides occupying peninsulas.[108]\\r\\nMost periodic tables are two-dimensional;[3] three-dimensional tables are known to as far back as at least 1862 (pre-dating Mendeleev's two-dimensional table of 1869). More recent examples include Courtines' Periodic Classification (1925),[109] Wringley's Lamina System (1949),[110] Gigure's Periodic helix (1965)[111] and Dufour's Periodic Tree (1996).[112] Going one further, Stowe's Physicist's Periodic Table (1989)[113] has been described as being four-dimensional (having three spatial dimensions and one colour dimension).[114]\\r\\nThe various forms of periodic tables can be thought of as lying on a chemistryÿphysics continuum.[115] Towards the chemistry end of the continuum can be found, as an example, Rayner-Canham's \\"unruly\\"[116] Inorganic Chemist's Periodic Table (2002),[117] which emphasizes trends and patterns, and unusual chemical relationships and properties. Near the physics end of the continuum is Janet's Left-Step Periodic Table (1928). This has a structure that shows a closer connection to the order of electron-shell filling and, by association, quantum mechanics.[118] A somewhat similar approach has been taken by Alper,[119] albeit criticized by Eric Scerri as disregarding the need to display chemical and physical periodicity.[120] Somewhere in the middle of the continuum is the ubiquitous common or standard form of periodic table. This is regarded as better expressing empirical trends in physical state, electrical and thermal conductivity, and oxidation numbers, and other properties easily inferred from traditional techniques of the chemical laboratory.[121] Its popularity is thought to be a result of this layout having a good balance of features in terms of ease of construction and size, and its depiction of atomic order and periodic trends.[69][122]\\r\\nSimply following electron configurations, hydrogen (electronic configuration 1s1) and helium (1s2) should be placed in groups 1 and 2, above lithium (1s22s1) and beryllium (1s22s2).[26] While such a placement is common for hydrogen, it is rarely used for helium outside of the context of electron configurations: When the noble gases (then called \\"inert gases\\") were first discovered around 1900, they were known as \\"group 0\\", reflecting no chemical reactivity of these elements known at that point, and helium was placed on the top of that group, as it did share the extreme chemical inertness seen throughout the group. As the group changed its formal number, many authors continued to assign helium directly above neon, in group 18; one of the examples of such placing is the current IUPAC table.[123]\\r\\nHydrogen's chemical properties are not very close to those of the alkali metals, which occupy group 1. On this basis it is sometimes placed elsewhere. A common alternative is at the top of group 17[120] given hydrogen's strictly univalent and largely non-metallic chemistry, and the strictly univalent and non-metallic chemistry of fluorine (the element otherwise at the top of group 17). Sometimes, to show hydrogen has properties corresponding to both those of the alkali metals and the halogens, it is shown at the top of the two columns simultaneously.[124] Another suggestion is above carbon in group 14: placed that way, it fits well into the trends of increasing ionization potential values and electron affinity values, and is not too far from the electronegativity trend, even though hydrogen cannot show the tetravalence characteristic of the heavier group 14 elements.[125] Finally, hydrogen is sometimes placed separately from any group; this is based on how general properties of hydrogen differ from that of any group. The other period 1 element, helium, is sometimes placed separately from any group as well.[126] The property that distinguishes helium from the rest of the noble gases (even though the extraordinary inertness of helium is extremely close to that of neon and argon)[127] is that in its closed electron shell, helium has only two electrons in the outermost electron orbital, while the rest of the noble gases have eight.\\r\\nAlthough scandium and yttrium are always the first two elements in group 3, the identity of the next two elements is not completely settled. They are commonly lanthanum and actinium, and less often lutetium and lawrencium. The two variants originate from historical difficulties in placing the lanthanides in the periodic table, and arguments as to where the f block elements start and end.[128][n 10][n 11] It has been claimed that such arguments are proof that, \\"it is a mistake to break the [periodic] system into sharply delimited blocks\\".[130] A third variant shows the two positions below yttrium as being occupied by the lanthanides and the actinides.\\r\\nChemical and physical arguments have been made in support of lutetium and lawrencium[131][132] but the majority of authors seem unconvinced.[133] Most working chemists are not aware there is any controversy.[134] In December 2015 an IUPAC project was established to make a recommendation on the matter.[135]\\r\\nLanthanum and actinium are commonly depicted as the remaining group 3 members.[136][n 12] It has been suggested that this layout originated in the 1940s, with the appearance of periodic tables relying on the electron configurations of the elements and the notion of the differentiating electron. The configurations of caesium, barium and lanthanum are [Xe]6s1, [Xe]6s2 and [Xe]5d16s2. Lanthanum thus has a 5d differentiating electron and this establishes it \\"in group 3 as the first member of the d-block for period 6\\".[137] A consistent set of electron configurations is then seen in group 3: scandium [Ar]3d14s2, yttrium [Kr]4d15s2 and lanthanum [Xe]5d16s2. Still in period 6, ytterbium was assigned an electron configuration of [Xe]4f135d16s2 and lutetium [Xe]4f145d16s2, \\"resulting in a 4f differentiating electron for lutetium and firmly establishing it as the last member of the f-block for period 6\\".[137] Later spectroscopic work found that the electron configuration of ytterbium was in fact [Xe]4f146s2. This meant that ytterbium and lutetiumthe latter with [Xe]4f145d16s2both had 14 f-electrons, \\"resulting in a d- rather than an f- differentiating electron\\" for lutetium and making it an \\"equally valid candidate\\" with [Xe]5d16s2 lanthanum, for the group 3 periodic table position below yttrium.[137] Lanthanum has the advantage of incumbency since the 5d1 electron appears for the first time in its structure whereas it appears for the third time in lutetium, having also made a brief second appearance in gadolinium.[138]\\r\\nIn terms of chemical behaviour,[139] and trends going down group 3 for properties such as melting point, electronegativity and ionic radius,[140][141] scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and actinium are similar to their group 1ÿ2 counterparts. In this variant, the number of f electrons in the most common (trivalent) ions of the f-block elements consistently matches their position in the f-block.[142] For example, the f-electron counts for the trivalent ions of the first three f-block elements are Ce 1, Pr 2 and Nd 3.[143]\\r\\nIn other tables, lutetium and lawrencium are the remaining group 3 members.[n 13] Early techniques for chemically separating scandium, yttrium and lutetium relied on the fact that these elements occurred together in the so-called \\"yttrium group\\" whereas La and Ac occurred together in the \\"cerium group\\".[137] Accordingly, lutetium rather than lanthanum was assigned to group 3 by some chemists in the 1920s and 30s.[n 14] Several physicists in the 1950s and '60s favoured lutetium, in light of a comparison of several of its physical properties with those of lanthanum.[137] This arrangement, in which lanthanum is the first member of the f-block, is disputed by some authors since lanthanum lacks any f-electrons. It has been argued that this is not valid concern given other periodic table anomaliesthorium, for example, has no f-electrons yet is part of the f-block.[144] As for lawrencium, its gas phase atomic electron configuration was confirmed in 2015 as [Rn]5f147s27p1. Such a configuration represents another periodic table anomaly, regardless of whether lawrencium is located in the f-block or the d-block, as the only potentially applicable p-block position has been reserved for nihonium with its predicted configuration of [Rn]5f146d107s27p1.[145][n 15]\\r\\nChemically, scandium, yttrium and lutetium (and presumably lawrencium) behave like trivalent versions of the group 1ÿ2 metals.[147] On the other hand, trends going down the group for properties such as melting point, electronegativity and ionic radius, are similar to those found among their group 4ÿ8 counterparts.[137] In this variant, the number of f electrons in the gaseous forms of the f-block atoms usually matches their position in the f-block. For example, the f-electron counts for the first five f-block elements are La 0, Ce 1, Pr 3, Nd 4 and Pm 5.[137]\\r\\nA few authors position all thirty lanthanides and actinides in the two positions below yttrium (usually via footnote markers). This variant emphasizes similarities in the chemistry of the 15 lanthanide elements (LaÿLu), possibly at the expense of ambiguity as to which elements occupy the two group 3 positions below yttrium, and a 15-column wide f block (there can only be 14 elements in any row of the f block).[n 16]\\r\\nThe definition of a transition metal, as given by IUPAC, is an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell.[148] By this definition all of the elements in groups 3ÿ11 are transition metals. The IUPAC definition therefore excludes group 12, comprising zinc, cadmium and mercury, from the transition metals category.\\r\\nSome chemists treat the categories \\"d-block elements\\" and \\"transition metals\\" interchangeably, thereby including groups 3ÿ12 among the transition metals. In this instance the group 12 elements are treated as a special case of transition metal in which the d electrons are not ordinarily involved in chemical bonding. The 2007 report of mercury(IV) fluoride (HgF4), a compound in which mercury would use its d electrons for bonding, has prompted some commentators to suggest that mercury can be regarded as a transition metal.[149] Other commentators, such as Jensen,[150] have argued that the formation of a compound like HgF4 can occur only under highly abnormal conditions; indeed, its existence is currently disputed. As such, mercury could not be regarded as a transition metal by any reasonable interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the term.[150]\\r\\nStill other chemists further exclude the group 3 elements from the definition of a transition metal. They do so on the basis that the group 3 elements do not form any ions having a partially occupied d shell and do not therefore exhibit any properties characteristic of transition metal chemistry.[151] In this case, only groups 4ÿ11 are regarded as transition metals. Though the group 3 elements show few of the characteristic chemical properties of the transition metals, they do show some of their characteristic physical properties (on account of the presence in each atom of a single d electron).[53]\\r\\nAlthough all elements up to oganesson have been discovered, of the elements above hassium (element 108), only copernicium (element 112), nihonium (element 113), and flerovium (element 114) have known chemical properties, and only for copernicium is there enough evidence for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, even though it is currently placed in the carbon group.[152] The current experimental evidence still leaves open the question of whether flerovium behaves more like a metal or a noble gas.[153]\\r\\nIt is unclear whether new elements will continue the pattern of the current periodic table as period 8, or require further adaptations or adjustments. Seaborg expected the eighth period to follow the previously established pattern exactly, so that it would include a two-element s-block for elements 119 and 120, a new g-block for the next 18 elements, and 30 additional elements continuing the current f-, d-, and p-blocks, culminating in element 168, the next noble gas.[155] More recently, physicists such as Pekka Pyykk? have theorized that these additional elements do not follow the Madelung rule, which predicts how electron shells are filled and thus affects the appearance of the present periodic table. There are currently several competing theoretical models for the placement of the elements of atomic number less than or equal to 172. In all of these it is element 172, rather than element 168, that emerges as the next noble gas after oganesson, although these must be regarded as speculative as no complete calculations have been done beyond element 122.[156]\\r\\nThe number of possible elements is not known. A very early suggestion made by Elliot Adams in 1911, and based on the arrangement of elements in each horizontal periodic table row, was that elements of atomic weight greater than circa 256 (which would equate to between elements 99 and 100 in modern-day terms) did not exist.[157] A highermore recentestimate is that the periodic table may end soon after the island of stability,[158] which is expected to centre around element 126, as the extension of the periodic and nuclides tables is restricted by proton and neutron drip lines.[159] Other predictions of an end to the periodic table include at element 128 by John Emsley,[3] at element 137 by Richard Feynman,[160] and at element 155 by Albert Khazan.[3][n 17]\\r\\nThe Bohr model exhibits difficulty for atoms with atomic number greater than 137, as any element with an atomic number greater than 137 would require 1s electrons to be travelling faster than c, the speed of light.[161] Hence the non-relativistic Bohr model is inaccurate when applied to such an element.\\r\\nThe relativistic Dirac equation has problems for elements with more than 137 protons. For such elements, the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory rather than bound, and there is no gap between the positive and negative energy spectra, as in the Klein paradox.[162] More accurate calculations taking into account the effects of the finite size of the nucleus indicate that the binding energy first exceeds the limit for elements with more than 173 protons. For heavier elements, if the innermost orbital (1s) is not filled, the electric field of the nucleus will pull an electron out of the vacuum, resulting in the spontaneous emission of a positron.[163] This does not happen if the innermost orbital is filled, so that element 173 is not necessarily the end of the periodic table.[160]\\r\\nThe many different forms of periodic table have prompted the question of whether there is an optimal or definitive form of periodic table.[164] The answer to this question is thought to depend on whether the chemical periodicity seen to occur among the elements has an underlying truth, effectively hard-wired into the universe, or if any such periodicity is instead the product of subjective human interpretation, contingent upon the circumstances, beliefs and predilections of human observers. An objective basis for chemical periodicity would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium, and the composition of group 3. Such an underlying truth, if it exists, is thought to have not yet been discovered. In its absence, the many different forms of periodic table can be regarded as variations on the theme of chemical periodicity, each of which explores and emphasizes different aspects, properties, perspectives and relationships of and among the elements.[n 18][citation needed]","input":"What is the 1st element in the periodic table?"},{"output":"December 9, 1898","context":"The Bombay City Improvement Trust (BIT) was created on December 9, 1898, in response to the Mumbai plague epidemic of 1896.

As a result of being in place for such a short time, and because the then Opposition leader Tony Abbott indicated he intended to repeal \\"the carbon tax\\", regulated organisations responded in a rather tepid and informal manner, with very few investments in emissions reductions being made.[2] The scheme was repealed on 17 July 2014, backdated to 1 July 2014. In its place the Abbott Government set up the Emission Reduction Fund in December 2014.\\r\\nThe carbon price was part of a broad energy reform package called the Clean Energy Futures Plan, which aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Australia by 5% below 2000 levels by 2020 and 80% below 2000 levels by 2050. The plan set out to achieve these targets by encouraging Australia's largest emitters to increase energy efficiency and invest in sustainable energy. The scheme was administered by the Clean Energy Regulator. Compensation to industry and households was funded by the revenue derived from the charge. The scheme required entities which emit over 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gases per year, and which were not in the transport or agriculture sectors, to obtain emissions permits, called carbon units. Carbon units were either purchased from the government or issued free as part of industry assistance measures. As part of the scheme, personal income tax was reduced for those earning less than $80,000 per year and the tax-free threshold was increased from $6,000 to $18,200.[3] Initially the price of a permit for one tonne of carbon was fixed at $23 for the 2012ÿ13 financial year, with unlimited permits being available from the government. The fixed price rose to $24.15 for 2013ÿ14. The government had announced that the scheme was part of a transition to an emissions trading scheme in 2014ÿ15, where the available permits will be limited in line with a pollution cap. The scheme primarily applied to electricity generators and industrial sectors. It did not apply to road transport and agriculture. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency stated that in June 2013 only 260 entities were subject to the scheme,[4] of which approximately 185 were liable to pay for carbon units. Domestic aviation did not face the carbon price scheme per se, but was subject to an additional fuel excise levy of approximately 6 cents per litre.\\r\\nIn February 2012, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Clean Energy Future carbon price scheme had not deterred new investment in the coal industry, as spending on exploration had increased by 62% in 2010-2011, more than any other mineral commodity. The government agency Geoscience Australia reported that investment in coal prospecting reached $520 million in 2010-2011.[5] Falls in carbon emissions were observed following implementation of this policy.[6] It was noted that emissions from sectors subject to the pricing mechanism were 1.0% lower[7] and nine months after the introduction of the pricing scheme, Australia's carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation had fallen to a 10-year low, with coal generation down 11% from 2008 to 2009.[8] However, attribution of these trends to carbon pricing have been disputed, with Frontier Economics claiming trends are largely explained by factors unrelated to the carbon tax.[9][10] Electricity demand had been falling and in 2012 was at the lowest level seen since 2006 in the National Electricity Market.[11]\\r\\nSource ÿ Australia's National Greenhouse Inventory Dec 2012\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRoss Garnaut[12]\\r\\nIn October 2006 the Stern Review on the effect of climate change on the world's economy was released for the British government. This report recommended a range of measures including ecotaxes to address the market failure represented by climate change with the least amount of economic and social disruption. In response to this report and subsequent pressure from the Kim Beazley led Labor opposition, in December 2006 the Howard Government established the Prime Ministerial Task Group on Emissions Trading, chaired by Peter Shergold, to advise on the implementation of an emissions trading scheme (ETS) in Australia.[13] In opposition, Kevin Rudd called for a cut to greenhouse gas emissions by 60% before 2050.[14] Both the incumbent Howard Government and the Rudd Labor opposition promised to implement an emissions trading scheme (ETS) before the 2007 federal election. Following the release of the final Shergold report, the Howard government committed to introduce an ETS in June 2007.[15][16]\\r\\nGoing into the 2007 federal election, the Labor opposition party presented itself as a \\"pro-climate\\" alternative to the Government, with Kevin Rudd, who had by then deposed Beazley as leader, famously describing climate change as \\"the great moral challenge of our generation\\". Labor differentiated itself from the government by promising an ETS with an earlier start date of 2010 rather than the 2012 timeframe advocated by Howard. It also promised ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, investment in clean coal and renewable energy, and slightly more aggressive targets for renewable energy.[13]\\r\\nLabor won the election on 24 November 2007, and on 3 December 2007 the Rudd Government signed the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol at the 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference. By ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, Australia committed to keeping emissions to no more than 108% of its 1990 emissions level by 2012. Australia's ratification came into effect on 11 March 2008.[17]\\r\\nThe Rudd government began negotiating the passage of an ETS through the Parliament. The Opposition led by Brendan Nelson called for the vote on the government's ETS be delayed until after the United Nations climate change summit in Copenhagen in December 2009. Prime Minister Rudd said in response that it would be \\"an act of absolute political cowardice, an absolute failure of leadership not to act on climate change until other nations had done so\\" and the government pursued the early introduction of the Scheme.[18]\\r\\nOn 16 July 2008, the Rudd Government released a green paper for its Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) (also known as Australia's ETS), outlining the intended design of the scheme. The CPRS was criticised by those who were both for and against action to mitigate climate change. Environmental lobby groups protested that the emissions reductions targets were too low, and that the level of assistance to polluters was too high. Industry and business lobby groups however argued for more permits and assistance to offset the economic impacts of the scheme on many enterprises, particularly given the context of the global financial crisis.[13] Malcolm Turnbull became the new Liberal Opposition Leader on 18 September 2008. On 30 September 2008, the Garnaut Climate Change Review, commissioned in April 2007 by Rudd when he was leader of the Opposition, released its final report. Garnaut recommended a price between $20 and $30 per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent with a rise of 4% each year.[12] A more detailed white paper on the CPRS was released on 15 December 2008.\\r\\nUnable to secure the support of the Australian Greens for their preferred model, the government entered negotiations with Turnbull, and in the lead up to the Copenhagen Conference, presented an amended CPRS scheme, with the support of Turnbull. The Turnbull-led Opposition supported the CPRS scheme in principle, although at times over 2009 they indicated disagreement with various details including the timing of implementation of the scheme, timing of the vote on the relevant legislation and on the level of assistance to be provided to polluting industries. The Opposition was able to negotiate greater compensation for polluters affected by the scheme in November 2009.[13][19]\\r\\nShortly before the Senate was due to vote on the carbon bills, on 1 December 2009 Tony Abbott replaced Turnbull as leader of the Liberal Party.[20] Abbot immediately called a secret ballot on support for the ETS among coalition MPs, which was overwhelmingly rejected.[21] The Coalition then withdrew their support for the carbon pricing policy and joined the Greens and Independents in voting against the relevant legislation in the Parliament of Australia on 2 December 2009.[22] As the Rudd government required the support of either the Coalition or the Greens to secure passage of the bill, it was defeated in the Senate. Abbott described Labor's ETS plan as a 'Great big tax on everything'. The Copenhagen Conference was unsuccessful in advancing international agreement.\\r\\nAbbott announced a new Coalition policy on carbon emission reduction in February 2010, which committed the Coalition to a 5% reduction in emissions by 2020. Abbott proposed the creation of an 'emissions reduction fund' to provide 'direct' incentives to industry and farmers to reduce carbon emissions.[23] In April 2010, Rudd deferred attempts to advance the scheme to at least 2013,[24] opting not to present the legislation to the Senate a second time, creating a trigger for a double dissolution election. In June 2010, Julia Gillard replaced Rudd as leader of the Labor Party and became Prime Minister. Factional leader and key Gillard supporter Bill Shorten said that the sudden announcement of change of policy on the ETS was a factor that had contributed to a collapse in support for Rudd's leadership.[25]\\r\\nShortly afterwards Gillard called a federal election for 21 August 2010. During the election campaign Gillard stated that she supported a price on carbon emissions and that she would prosecute the case for action for as long as she needed to win community support.[26] However, she also indicated that she would not introduce carbon pricing until there was a sufficient consensus on the issue,[27] and she specifically ruled out the introduction of a \\"carbon tax\\".[26]\\r\\nThe result of the election left Australia with its first hung parliament in 70 years. To form a majority in the House of Representatives both of the major parties needed to acquire the support of cross-benchers, including the Greens. After two weeks of negotiations Gillard had enough support to gain a majority including the support of the Greens and their single MP in the House, Adam Bandt. Gillard, therefore, remained Prime Minister and Abbott remained in Opposition. One of the conditions for Greens support was that the formation of a cross-party parliamentary committee to determine policy on climate change. Gillard honoured that agreement and on 27 September 2010 the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee (MPCCC) was formed, its terms of reference including that it was to report to Cabinet on ways to introduce a carbon price.[28][29] The MPCCC agreed on the introduction of a fixed carbon price commencing 1 July 2012, transitioning to a flexible-price cap-and-trade ETS on 1 July 2015.[30] Initially the price of permits is fixed and the quantity unlimited i.e. there is no cap; the scheme thus functions similarly, and is popularly referred to as a tax.\\r\\nIn February 2011, the government proposed the Clean Energy Bill,[31] which the opposition claimed to be a broken election promise.[32] The Liberal Party vowed to overturn the bill if it was elected.[33]\\r\\nThe Gillard Government had asked the Productivity Commission to report on the steps taken by eight major economies to address climate change. In June 2011, the report found that more than 1,000 climate policies were already enacted across the globe.[34][35] It also supported a market-based carbon price as being the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions.[35] The report's findings were one of the major reasons that support for the carbon tax was provided by independent Tony Windsor.[35] Windsor made it clear that he would not support the clean energy legislation if it included a carbon tax on transport fuels.[36] He did not want to penalise people who lived in rural areas, where there was no public transport as an alternative to private vehicles.\\r\\nThe Clean Energy Plan was released on 10 July 2011.[22] The Clean Energy Bill 2011 passed the House of Representatives in October 2011 and the Senate in November 2011 and was thus brought into law.[37][38]\\r\\nOn 1 July 2012 the Australian Federal government introduced a carbon price scheme. To offset the impact of the tax on some sectors of society, the government reduced income tax (by increasing the tax-free threshold) and increased pensions and welfare payments slightly to cover expected price increases, as well as introducing compensation for some affected industries. On 17 July 2014, a report by the Australian National University estimated that the Australian scheme had cut carbon emissions by as much as 17 million tonnes, the biggest annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 24 years of records in 2013 as the carbon tax helped drive a large drop in pollution from the electricity sector.[39]\\r\\nOn 17 July 2014, the Abbott Government passed repeal legislation through the Senate to abolish the carbon pricing scheme.[40] In its place the government set up the Emission Reduction Fund,[41] paid by taxpayers from consolidated revenue, which according to RepuTex, a markets consultancy, estimated the governments main climate policy may only meet a third of the emissions reduction challenge if Australia is to cut 2000 levels by 5% by 2020.[42]\\r\\nThe carbon price came into effect on 1 July 2012 and applied to direct emissions from a facility (scope-1 emissions), and not to indirect emissions (scope-2 emissions). The scheme only applied to facilities which emit more than 25,000 tonnes CO2-e per year, and did not apply to agriculture or to transport fuels. The carbon price was set at AUD$23 per tonne of emitted CO2-e on selected fossil fuels consumed by major industrial emitters and government bodies such as councils.\\r\\nAgricultural emissions were exempt due to difficulty in tracking emissions and the related complexity of administering such a scheme.[43] Households and business use of light vehicles did not incur a carbon price. However, changes to the fuel tax regime were proposed to effectively impose a carbon tax on business liquid and gaseous fuel emissions. There were plans for heavy on-road vehicles to pay from 1 July 2014.[44]\\r\\nIn effect, the scope of the scheme meant that only a small number of large electricity generators and larger industrial plants were subject to the carbon price scheme. The tax was payable by surrendering carbon units, which had been either purchased (at $20 per tonne in 2012ÿ13) or acquired free under an industry assistance program. The pricing mechanism was expected to cover 60% of Australia's carbon emissions.[1] 75% of each company's annual obligation were to be paid by 15 June each year with the remaining 25% by the following 1 February.\\r\\nA list of companies which have paid carbon tax, and the amount which each had paid was published by the Clean Energy Regulator (CER).[45][46] This was called the Liable Entities Public Information Database or LEPID. The LEPID for 2012ÿ13 was updated on 12 July 2013 and the companies which were the fifteen largest payers of carbon tax in 2012ÿ13 are shown in the summary below (related companies are grouped together where identifiable).\\r\\n(account for 70% of total carbon units lodged)\\r\\nin 2012ÿ13 (million)\\r\\nSource ÿ LEPID 12 July 2013\\r\\nThe Climate Change Authority, a statutory agency, was created to advise the government on the setting of carbon pollution caps, to conduct periodic reviews of the carbon pricing process, and to report on progress towards meeting national targets.[47] These pollution caps were to form the basis for the cap-and-trade structure to commence in 2015.\\r\\nThe Government ran several major Industry Assistance programs to reduce the impact of carbon tax for the 185 affected companies. These have the effect of significantly reducing the actual carbon tax raised.\\r\\nThe Jobs and Competitiveness Program was for the non-electricity sector and was targeted at the emissions-intensive trade-exposed activities ÿ that is, companies which emitted a lot of CO2 and were exposed to imports or who trade internationally. There was a list of 48 trade-exposed activities, including business such as steel making, alumina refining, cement making and similar activities.\\r\\nDepending on whether a company was highly or moderately emissions intensive, it received 94.5% or 66% of average industry carbon costs supplied as free carbon units.\\r\\nOverall in 2012ÿ13 under the Jobs and Competitiveness Program, there were 104 million free carbon units issued to 123 applicants, valued at approximately $2.4 billion. The fifteen largest recipients of free carbon units in 2012ÿ13, with related companies grouped together where identifiable, were:\\r\\n(under Jobs & Competitiveness Program)\\r\\nin 2012ÿ13 (million)\\r\\nSource ÿ Clean Energy Regulator\\r\\nTo put this into context, the LEPID list indicated that the total amount of carbon units to be surrendered would be 283 million units for 2012ÿ13. 37% of these were awarded for free under the Jobs and Competitiveness Program.\\r\\nUnder the Coal Fired Generation Assistance for coal-based electricity generating companies the Government gave out 42 million of free carbon units each year, valued at almost $5 billion. These were only issued to the generators with the highest amount of CO2 emission intensity, above 1.0 tonne of CO2 per MWh of energy. These were primarily the brown coal-fired generators in Victoria's Latrobe Valley\\r\\nThe free units were shared according to their size and the amount of CO2 produced compared to a more efficient black coal-fired power station. The list of companies which received the free units was published by the Clean Energy Regulator.[48] Nine power stations qualified ÿ the big four brown coal plants in Victoria, and five other much smaller plants. The four big brown coal plants in Victoria received the majority share of free carbon units, around 37 million of the 42 million free carbon units in September each year.\\r\\nWith an average emissions intensity of 1.3, that effectively meant there was no carbon tax on the first 20 TWh (or approximately 50%) they collectively produced each year.\\r\\nThe Steel Transformation Plan was a $500 million package for Australia's two steelmakers. In 2012, payments of $160 million were made, $200 M to BlueScope and $70 M to OneSteel.\\r\\nBecause the Australian carbon tax does not apply to all fossil fuels usage, it only had an effect on some of the emitters of greenhouse gases. Among those emitters to which it applied, emissions were significantly lower after introduction of the tax. According to the Investor Group on Climate Change, emissions from companies subject to the tax went down 7% with the introduction of the tax, and the tax was \\"the major contributor\\" to this reduction.[49]\\r\\nAustralias total greenhouse gas emissions increased by 0.3% in the first six months of the Carbon Tax to December 2012 to 276.5 Mt CO2 equiv,[50] while Australia's gross domestic product grew at a rate of 2.5% per annum.\\r\\nGreenhouse emissions from stationary energy (excluding electricity) and transport grew by 4% in the first six months of the carbon tax to December 2012.\\r\\nHowever, there is a five-year trend for emissions from the electricity generation sector in Australia to decline. Electricity emissions peaked at 38% of the national total in September quarter 2008, coinciding with the start of the Global Financial Crisis. In December 2012, electricity emissions were just 33% of national emissions. The decline is due partly to an almost 6% reduction in electricity demand in the National Electricity market since 2008. This fall in electricity demand followed:{\\r\\nOther factors contributing to the five-year fall in greenhouse emissions from the electricity sector are:{\\r\\nThe Australian Government said in July 2013 that the carbon tax was a factor in reducing the emissions intensity in the National Electricity Market from 0.92 t of CO2 per MWh to 0.87 in the 11 months following its introduction.[51]\\r\\nSince the carbon tax was introduced, wholesale electricity prices in the National Electricity market have increased significantly. The Energy Users Association of Australia in its June 2013 paper said that electricity generators have been able to pass through more than 100% of the cost of the carbon tax. If the outcomes observed in the spot market persist then it can be unequivocally concluded that both fossil fuel generators and renewable generators will have gained as a result of emission pricing, at users expense. Surely this is not what was intended.\\"[52]\\r\\nFrontier Economics said the reduction in emissions from the electricity sector in the first year of the carbon tax was 'largely explained by factors unrelated to the carbon tax'. [9][10]\\r\\nThe Energy Users Association of Australia (EUAA) said in June 2013 \\"we suggest that it cannot be said that pricing emissions has reduced emissions in stationary energy to any meaningful extent\\" [52]\\r\\nAGL ÿ In relation to its purchase of the Loy Yang brown coal fired power station in 2012, one of the single largest emitters of CO2 in Australia states On the supply side of the business, the most significant strategic development was the decision to buy the Loy Yang A power station.?... The Board also recognised that coal fired generation would be required for decades to come if the demand from Australian households and businesses for electricity was to continue to be satisfied [53]\\r\\nAdelaide Brighton (Australias second largest cement producer) .AdelaideBrighton expects it will significantly mitigate the impact of the carbon tax over the next five years by:{\\r\\nBlueScope (Australias largest steelmaker) \\"When funds from the Steel Transformation Plan are taken into account, the Company does not expect to face a net carbon liability over the period.[55]\\r\\nDavid Kassulke, the manager of AJ Bush & Sons, expressed grave concerns over the carbon tax during the lead up to its implementation. However, he now says the carbon tax has had a positive impact on the business. The company expects to cut carbon emissions from 85,000 to 30,000 tonnes per year with the construction of a new biogas plant in 2013.\\r\\n\\"The end result of the introduction of the new biogas technology will not only be a saving of millions of dollars in energy and carbon costs, but also an opportunity for the company to be positioned at the cutting edge of renewable energy technology in the rendering industry, Mr Kassulke said.\\"\\r\\nThe (biogas technology) investment is a good way to modernise and will dramatically reduce our emissions.\\"\\r\\nIt will mean that we will reduce our emissions to the point where we will no longer be a big polluter any more.\\"\\r\\nWhat the imposition of the carbon tax has done is make industry take stock of what it is currently doing and has forced it to look at doing things in a better way.\\"\\r\\nIt means companies are now looking at ways to use less energy which equates to less cost and a subsequent reduction in the tax that is being levied.That has been the intention of the tax and clearly from that perspective it is working and working well.[56]\\r\\nThe introduction of a carbon price in Australia was controversial. The day before the 2010 federal election, Prime Minister, Julia Gillard sent out a message regarding carbon pricing, stating \\"I don't rule out the possibility of legislating a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, a market-based mechanism.\\" However the article also articulated her position on that term of government. \\"While any carbon price would not be triggered until after the 2013 election... She would legislate the carbon price next term if sufficient consensus existed\\",[57] and the federal opposition accused the government of breaking an election promise to not introduce a carbon tax.[58] Julia Gillard responded to these accusations by saying that circumstances changed following the 2010 election.[59][60] Then opposition leader Tony Abbott criticised the carbon pricing policy on economic grounds referring to it as \\"toxic\\" and likening it to an octopus embracing the whole of the economy.[61] He pledged to repeal the tax after the 18 clean energy bills passed through the House of Representatives and stated that the next election would be a referendum on the \\"carbon tax\\".[62][63]\\r\\nThe opposition (and since the 2013 election the Abbott government) proposed an alternative \\"direct-action\\" carbon emissions reduction scheme. Modelling produced by the Department of the Treasury indicated that this scheme would cost twice as much as the Clean Energy Futures Plan.[64] Abbott was unable to find an Australian economist who supported his policy, although he did cite international economists who are supportive.[65] Tony Abbott's \\"Direct Action Plan\\" has been criticised because there is no disincentive to continue polluting at the same rate, meaning that emissions will increase rather than decrease by 2020. In addition, \\"under Direct Action it is the public, not polluters who pay.\\"[66]\\r\\nThe Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) was established as part of the Clean Energy Fund, and commenced operations on 1 July 2012. It consolidated existing renewable energy technology innovation programs. It had funds to provide financial assistance to research, develop, demonstrate, deploy and commercialise renewable energy in Australia and related technologies.[67] The government-established but independent Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) commenced investment operations from 1 July 2013, with a focus on investments in renewable energy, low-emissions and energy efficiency technology and the manufacturing companies that produce materials used in such technologies.[68]\\r\\nThe majority of big emitters in Australia supported a price on carbon as at July 2012.[69] However business groups and some big emitters, especially in the mining sector, were opposed to the pricing scheme.[70]\\r\\nResearch by Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg at the University of Queensland revealed that liable organisations responded with very few investments in emissions reduction activities, largely due to the great deal of policy uncertainty surrounding the scheme.[2]\\r\\nOne criticism of the carbon pricing scheme has been that Australia should not proceed with its introduction ahead of other countries. However, according to the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Australia will be one of around 50 jurisdictions implementing similar schemes worldwide.[72] The starting price of $23 per tonne has also been a point of contention.[72]\\r\\nEmissions figures from the 2010ÿ11 financial year suggest the electricity generation sector may be due to pay around $3.9?billion.[73] Loans have been made available so that electricity generators can purchase carbon permits. Macquarie Generation, a Government of New South Wales owned electricity generator, wrote down the value of its assets by about $1?billion as a result of the carbon tax.[74] Power generators in the La Trobe Valley also face substantial write-downs.\\r\\nModelling undertaken by the Virgin Australia airline calculated that the average increase per flight would be $3. They responded by implementing a surcharge of between $1.00 and $5.00 to a one-way flight starting in July 2012.[75] Qantas is raising its ticket prices by between $1.50 and $5.50.\\r\\nIn a survey conducted by the Economic Society of Australia, 60% of economists thought the carbon pricing proposal was sound economic policy, while 25% disagreed.[76] A number of public protests both in support of and against the carbon price (or tax) have been held in the run up to its introduction. These include the No Carbon Tax Climate Sceptics rallies and Say Yes demonstrations.\\r\\nThe carbon pricing scheme was intended to improve energy efficiency, convert electricity generation from coal to alternatives and shift economic activity towards a low carbon economy.[77] Its impact on business was forecast to be 0.1?ÿ?0.2% lower than the business as usual scenario.[78] The scheme aimed to prevent 160?million tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere by 2020,[79] as well as generating $24?billion over three years.[80]\\r\\nIn May 2012, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) reported it was investigating about 100 cases where customers had possibly been misled into paying excessive price rises falsely claimed to be as a result of the carbon tax.[81] By the middle of June, the commission was investigating about 200 cases.[82] The consumer watchdog also set up a phone hotline and online form for complaints regarding excess pricing claimed to be due to the carbon tax. The ACCC had forecast that home construction costs would be at the lower end of the 0.7% to 1.8% range predicted by building companies.[83] The Housing Industry Association estimated an average new house would experience a price increase of between 0.8% and 1.7% due to the carbon price.[84] Housing construction was expected to be significantly impacted by the carbon tax because new homes require cement, bricks, aluminium, and glass, which are all typically energy-intensive materials.[85] A forecast by the Centre for International Economics predicted the housing construction industry could decline by 12.6% as a result of the carbon price.[85]\\r\\nThe coal industry was expected to be impacted due to the emissions produced as coal is mined, however a similar expense is not expected to be incurred by Australia's coal exporting competitors.[77] The Institute of Public Affairs claimed that the Australian coal industry would lose jobs to overseas competitors and mines will be closed.[86] Despite the announcement of the scheme, spending on mineral exploration in the March quarter was the highest ever at $1.086?billion.[87] The impact on the LNG industry in Australia was expected to be minor to moderate.[88] No major projects were expected to be cancelled as a result of the introduction of the carbon pricing scheme. Dairy farmers will be impacted because of higher power costs for milk processing.[89]\\r\\nHousehold bills were expected to rise by an average of around $5 per week.[90] Energy retailer Synergy said the carbon price would result in a 7.1% rise to power bills.[91]\\r\\nBecause carbon pricing would indirectly flow through to consumers, the Australian government implemented household assistance measures.\\r\\nThe measures included changes to income tax: the tax-free threshold increased from $6,000 to $18,200 on 1 July 2012, and was scheduled to rise to $19,400 from 1 July 2015.[92] The changes meant those earning less than $20,000 received a tax cut with those earning up to $5,000 receiving the greatest tax reduction.[93][94] The changes were described as the biggest overhaul of taxation since the Goods and Services Tax was introduced in 2000.[93]\\r\\nOther steps included direct payments into bank accounts beginning in May 2012.[95] The payments, called the Clean Energy Advance, were targeted at low- and middle-income households.[96]\\r\\nSome industries received direct compensation. As part of the Energy Security Fund, $1?billion was promised to highly emissions-intensive coal-fired generators.[97] Most of that funding was intended for coal-fired power generators in Victoria.[98] Research by the Grattan Institute suggested that no black coal mining or liquefied natural gas projects would be scrapped as a result of carbon pricing, regardless of industry compensation; it further claimed that, if coupled with compensation, the carbon pricing regime would in fact leave the steel industry better off.[99]\\r\\nUnder the Carbon Farming Initiative, farmers and graziers would have been able to plant trees to earn carbon credits, which could have been on-sold to companies liable to pay a carbon price.[100] The Clean Technology Investment Program was touted as helping the manufacturing sector to support investments in \\"energy-efficient capital equipment and low emission technologies, processes and products\\".[101] Companies in the food sector would also have been able to apply for grants to improve their energy efficiency.[102]\\r\\nSix months after the introduction of carbon pricing the Department of Climate Change and Renewable Energy reported a 9% decrease in emissions from electricity generators.[103]\\r\\nNine months after the introduction of the pricing scheme, Australia's emissions of carbon dioxide due to electricity generation fell to a 10-year low, with coal generation down 6% from 2008 to 2009.[104]\\r\\nHeading into the 2013 Australian federal election, the Liberal Party platform included the removal of the 'Carbon Tax', claiming that the election was in effect a referendum on carbon pricing in Australia. The incoming Liberal Government placed removing the carbon pricing scheme at the head of its legislative program.\\r\\nThe carbon tax repeal legislation received Royal Assent on 17 July 2014 and the bills which were part of the package became law, with effect from 1 July 2014.[105]","input":"When was the carbon tax introduced in australia?"},{"output":"January 2, 1968","context":"The Bilingual Education Act (BEA) (81?Stat.?816), also known as Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Amendments of 1967 (Pub.L. 90ÿ247), approved by the 90th United States Congress on January 2, 1968, and was the first United States federal legislation recognized the needs of limited English speaking ability (LESA) students. The BEA was introduced in 1967 by Texas senator Ralph Yarborough and was signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson on January 2, 1968. While some states, such as California and Texas, and numerous local school districts around the country already had policies and programs designed to meet the special educational needs of elementary and secondary school students not fluent in the English language, this act signaled that the federal government now also recognized the need for and value of bilingual education programs in U.S. public education. Passed on the heels of the Civil Rights movement, its purpose was to provide school districts with federal funds, in the form of competitive grants, to establish innovative educational programs for students with limited English speaking ability.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BEA was a significant piece of education legislation. Its passage signaled \\"a shift from the notion that students should be afforded equal educational opportunity to the idea that educational policy should work to equalize academic outcomes, even if such equity demanded providing different learning environments.\\"[2]\\r\\nAdditionally, it reflected changes in cultural perspectives towards diversity and immigration. The BEA was an important shift away from the late 1950s anticommunist sentiment where anything foreign was suspect, which had destroyed many earlier local and state attempts at bilingual education.[3] Furthermore, it recognized that the federal government was responsible for educating immigrants to the US and opened doors for bilingual education projects on local, state, and federal levels.\\r\\nFurthermore, this legislation, successfully enacted into law largely thanks to the efforts of Spanish speakers, has become an important part of the \\"polemic between assimilation and multiculturalism\\" and the role that language education in our society.[4] Because the BEA in its original form promoted celebrating linguistic and cultural differences and diversity in the U.S., it in many ways challenged assimilationist theories and the \\"melting pot\\" concept of the U.S. And yet, in its final form when passed, it did not mention the important link between language and culture, leaving the language vague.\\r\\nThe act additionally opened up a larger need for teachers who could teach language and other content within a language besides English. This placed a strain on the teaching pool available in 1968 and even today there is a shortage of teachers for these highly specialized positions. Culturally, it was argued in this time period that by teaching in a certain language it also taught specific values instead of just a way of communication.[5]\\r\\nWhen Senator Yarborough introduced the bill to the Senate in 1967, he envisioned it as a way of addressing the \\"'poor performance in school and high dropout rates... and great psychological harm' caused by 'English-only policies, no Spanish-speaking rules, and cultural degradation'\\" that was evident in many schools at the time.[6]\\r\\nAlthough the passage of the act was a bipartisan effort on behalf of Republicans and Democrats, it underwent significant changes between 1967 and 1968. Many of these changes were in the wording and framing of the act, which ultimately did not recognize the importance of biculturalism or the benefit of bilingualism or even the link between language and culture. Rather, it framed students of LESA as a \\"problem\\" that needed to be fixed. In addition, unlike what Yarborough had conceived, it provided no funding for permanent programs regarding students of LESA, as many people feared promoting a sense of entitlement in students and families benefitting from the act.\\r\\nThe BEA provided school districts with federal funds, in the form of competitive grants, to establish innovative educational programs for students with limited English speaking ability. The grants that the act provided were given directly to school districts and were to be used to buy resources for educational programs, to train teachers and teachers' aides, to develop and distribute materials and to create meaningful parental involvement projects. Although the act did not require the use of bilingual instruction or the use of a student's native language, its aim was to encourage innovative programs designed to teach students English. The act also gave school districts the opportunity to provide bilingual education programs without violating segregation laws, but at this time, participation was voluntary. Program effectiveness was evaluated at the end of every year and successful programs were eligible to receive federal funding for up to five years.\\r\\nBecause the BEA funding was provided in the form of grants, most of the financial clout lay with local and state education agencies (LEAs and SEAs). However, the federal government limited the reach of these funds in a few significant ways. To begin with, from a simple framing standpoint, the original 1968 BEA did not include any mention of instruction in or maintenance of a student's native language, limiting the potential impact of the act.\\r\\nFrom a financial perspective, the BEA was also limited. The only programs eligible for receiving funding were programs for children between the ages of 3 and 8. Because it was meant to redress the dropout issue, the act with this caveat on funding viewed high school students of LESA somewhat of a lost cause. In addition, the act did not fund any permanent programs for educating students of LESA, but only funding exploratory programs. As a result, it did not seek to truly address the burgeoning issue of how to educate students who were not English dominant. Lastly, the funds were at first reserved for communities whose average income was below the poverty line stated in the ESEA ($3,000 in 1968). This limitation on funding had the unfortunate side effect of framing the act as a somewhat of a handout to poor, Latino communities.[7]\\r\\nDue to many of these limitations and the vague wording of much of the BEA, funding was limited in the first three years to $85 million. By 1972, \\"only 100,391 students nationally, out of approximately 5,000,000 in need were enrolled in a Title VII-funded program.\\"[8]\\r\\nThe Bilingual Education Act of 1968 was not specific and participation by school districts was voluntary. As a result, Civil rights activists argued that the rights of minority-language students were being violated under this act.[9] In 1974, three amendments were made to the original act in an attempt to clarify the intent and design of programs designated for the education of LESA students. There were two significant events that impacted these changes: the Lau V. Nichols case and the Equal Educational Opportunity Act of 1974.\\r\\nLau v. Nichols was a class-action suit brought against the San Francisco School District and alleged that due to their inability to speak English, there were 1,800 Chinese students who were being denied an equal education. In 1974, the Supreme Court overruled the ruling of the lower courts and determined that the same resources, teachers and curriculum did not imply that the education was equal for students who had a limited command of the English language.[10] In the same year as the Supreme Court's ruling, the Equal Education Opportunity Act was passed. By citing instructional programs as the means through which language barriers were to be broken, it effectively extended the Lau ruling to all students and school districts. Furthermore, school districts were required to have special programs for LESA students regardless of federal or state funding.[11]\\r\\nThe amendments in 1974 served to do the following:\\r\\nFunding increased from $7.5 million in 1968 to $68 million and as a result, programs were able to impact 368,000 students.[12]\\r\\nIn 1978, further amendments were made to extend the act and broaden the definition of eligible students. Specifically, these amendments served to do the following:\\r\\nFunding increased from $68 million in 1974 to $135 million which was enough to provide funding for 565 school districts and for secondary programs including service centers, graduate school fellowships and training for undergraduate students interested in becoming bilingual educators.[14]\\r\\nIn 1984, the Bilingual Education Act was further modified. The amendments enacted during this time served to:\\r\\nFunding for these amendments was $139.4 million and there was a heavy emphasis placed on districts using the funding to build enough capacity to eventually be able to support LEP programs without federal government funding.[16]\\r\\nThe BEA was amended again in 1988. The changes this year served to:\\r\\nFunding for the 1988 amendments was $159 million, with regulations for how the money should be divided. Specifically, at least 60% should be spent developing programs and at least 25% of funds should be spent on training.[17]\\r\\nThe Bilingual Education Act (BEA) reauthorization in 1994 maintained the same tenets as the original BEA, introduced new grant categories, set up preference to programs promoting bilingualism, and took into account indigenous languages. Overall, the premise of this addition was to introduce a more systemic reform.[18]\\r\\nNo Child Left Behind (NCLB), passed in 2002, had a significant impact on bilingual education and the Bilingual Education Act in the United States due to its emphasis on high-stakes testing. As a result of NCLB and its emphasis on testing, the Bilingual Education Act was renamed the English Language Acquisition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achievement Act.\\r\\nThe name change alone of BEA under NCLB is significant in that it signals a shift in the philosophical approach to bilingual education. Essentially, even though the act still leaves with state and local educators the ability to choose from instructional methods, \\"the statement of purpose and accountability requirements make clear that the primary objective is English acquisition.\\"[26]\\r\\nUnder NCLB, school success and failure is linked to performance on standardized tests. However, this measure subjects English Language Learners (ELLs) \\"to critical assessments without adequate preparation.\\"[27] The lack of preparation is due to the fact that NCLB caps funding for bilingual education programs at half of what it had been and does not require that any bilingual education programs undergo periodic evaluation, a measure required by the Castenada v. Pickard court case. And yet, despite this lack of preparation, ELLs performance on standardized tests can jeopardize a school's access to funding. In essence, \\"This turns the question of whether or not a school receives a failing label into a question of how many ELLs attend.\\"[28] Because the impact of NCLB on ELLs has significant implications on ELLs and their communities' access to education, NCLB is in conflict with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in that it denies \\"access to a federally funded program based on their skin color or race.\\"[28] The changes in the BEA under NCLB created a grant program that attempted to enhance English language acquisition. The ruling placed ELL students in a similar classroom environment as their peers for whom English is not a second language. The law did not require schools to provide bilingual programs and placed them against the rigorous content standards put in place by State Education Agencies. When ELLs were tested with the same state assessments or the National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP), it was shown that compared to their fluently English-speaking peers the ELL students displayed larger deficits in both reading and math. The 2007 NAEP test, showed increased deficits in both math and reading following a surge of the ELL population in the United States. By 2005 the number of English-learners throughout the US had risen to 57% to approximately 5.1 million students.[29]\\r\\nAfter NCLB was enacted it was shown that there were sufficient numbers of prospective teachers, yet there were insufficient numbers of these teachers entering certain fields. Among these specializations were science, math, foreign languages, special education and namely bilingual education. Several initiatives formed to specifically recruit teachers to these specialization fields and allowed for alternative certification paths. These teacher shortages continue to exist today and are seen to a greater extent in high-poverty districts.[30]\\r\\nThe act and NCLB say that the accommodations that it provides should be interpreted in concordance with federal civil rights laws. \\"As interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, Congress, and federal civil rights officials, these provisions rely on terms like affirmative steps and appropriate action that give school districts the discretion to use a range of instructional approaches. As a result, under both Title VI and the EEOA, courts and federal enforcement agencies must decide on a case-by-case basis whether programs are in fact overcoming linguistic barriers to full participation.\\"[31] The policy still remains highly debated at both the state and federal level.","input":"When did bilingual education start in the us?"},{"output":"Southern Baptist","context":"Elevation Church is a Southern Baptist multi-site church pastored by Steven Furtick, based in Matthews, North Carolina.[2] Elevation has 17 locations, with 9 in the Charlotte area, as well as locations in Raleigh; Winston-Salem; Roanoke Virginia; Melbourne Florida; and the Greater Toronto Area.[3] From 2007 through 2010, Elevation was cited by Outreach Magazine as one of the Top 100 fastest growing churches in the United States.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe church began as a church plant of the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina,. As part of a church planting team, Furtick and seven other families from Christ Covenant Church in Shelby, North Carolina, relocated to Matthews, meeting in Providence High School.[5] On February 5, 2006, the first Sunday worship service, 121 people attended.[6] As of 2013, the church reported a regular attendance of about 15,000 people.[1]\\r\\nServices are held at nine Charlotte-area locations, as well as locations in Raleigh, North Carolina; Roanoke, Virginia; Melbourne, Florida; the Greater Toronto Area, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\\r\\nCharlotte Area Campuses:\\r\\nOther Campuses:\\r\\nPast Campuses:\\r\\nSince 2006, Elevation Church has given more than $10 million.[15] In 2011, a partnership with Charlotte Mayor Anthony Foxx was established to give 100,000 hours and $750,000 to serve Charlotte people in \\"The Orange Initiative.\\" In 2012, the church completed The Orange Initiative with over 102,000 hours served.[16]\\r\\nIn 2008, Elevation Church gave out $40,000 to members, in envelopes filled with $5, $20, even $1,000, and told them to spend it kindly on others.[17]\\r\\nSince 2010, Elevation Church has hosted a week-long outreach called \\"Love Week.\\"[18] During the church's 2010 \\"Love Week,\\" Elevation members packed more than 10,000 sandwiches for the homeless, helped single mothers get their cars serviced, donated blood, cleaned up parks and streets, built a soccer field for local ministries and renovated buildings.[19] In 2011, Elevation and over 25 other local churches served more than 34,000 hours in a single week.[18] In 2012, Elevation partnered with 31 other churches to serve 62 outreach organizations for a total of 50,340 hours around the city of Charlotte, N.C.. Elevation also partnered with Presbyterian Hospital-Matthews to help fund enhancements and expansion at a local free clinic.[20]\\r\\nIn 2012, Elevation Church launched an initiative calling for members to mentoring a child for the 2012-2013 school year, with over 1,600 responding.[21] The school outreach program was criticized in local LGBT media.[22]\\r\\nElevation Churchand, in particular, senior pastor Steven Furtickhave caused controversy over the church's lack of financial transparency, Furtick's personal wealth, and questionable practices by the church.\\r\\nIn 2013, Furtick and his wife built a large house (8,400 sq. ft, heated, 16,000 sq. ft total) on 19 acres of land in Waxhaw, NC, a suburb of Charlotte.[23] The house and land are valued at just under $1.8 million.[24] Furtick has stated that his home was paid for with money from his book sales and publisher advances, rather than his salary from Elevation Church.[25][26] The church has refused to answer questions about Furtick's salary, his tax-free housing allowance, how much he makes from books and speaking fees,[27] with Elevation only saying that Furtick is generous to the church with the money he receives from writing books, arranges for the church to purchase his books directly from the publisher at the author's discount and keep the money from sales, and that the publisher pays the church to produce marketing materials to promote Furtick's books. Elevation has confirmed that Furtick's salary is set by a Board of Overseers composed of other megachurch pastors, who vote on his salary based on a compensation study conducted by an outside firm, and that Furtick does not vote on his own salary.[28][29] In response to the news report, before his sermon on the weekend of October 27, 2013, Furtick addressed the congregation directly, saying he was sorry if the house and surrounding questions caused them to have difficult conversations with co-workers, friends and neighbors.[27] However, he defended the building of the house, calling it \\"a gift from God\\".[30]\\r\\nElevation Church has also been criticized over its practice of selecting volunteers who wish to be baptized to do so during so-called \\"spontaneous baptism\\" services. During these services, which usually take place during normally scheduled weekend services, the volunteers are asked to sit in prominent areas and instructed to respond immediately to Furtick's calls for volunteers to be baptized with the intent of inspiring genuine spontaneous baptisms.[31]\\r\\nCharlotte resident Warren Cole Smith, writing about Furtick for World magazine, said \\"People were willing to excuse his flamboyance and extravagant lifestyle by saying but Hes doing such great work. Now, this new controversy calls into serious question the legitimacy of conversion rates the church have been claiming.\\"[32] In response to the initial coverage, Elevation released a statement, which reads in part: \\"We are confident that those who attend Elevation Church know and understand our mission and vision for reaching people for Jesus Christ. As attendees, they are provided, through weekly teachings, biblical context for everything we do and practice, such as baptism, giving, serving and inviting friends to church.\\"[32]\\r\\nLocal members of the LGBT community and LGBT media have also criticized the church for its general stances on homosexuality. A former attendee who is gay spoke out after the Elevation hosted Ted Haggard, a former evangelical preacher who stepped down from his position after being accused of a gay affair.[33] An unknown gay individual who claims to be a former attendee said in a blog post that Elevation has a \\"problem with privilege\\" and that Furtick \\"leaves LGBTQ people with no answers and no hope, just the sense that something is wrong with them for missing the obvious.\\" [34]","input":"What denomination is elevation church in charlotte nc?"},{"output":"turquoise","context":"The Golden Arches are the symbol of McDonald's, the global fast-food restaurant chain. Originally, real arches were part of the restaurant design. They were incorporated into the chain's logo in 1962, which resembled a stylized restaurant, and in the current Golden Arches logo, introduced 1968, resembling an \\"M\\" for \\"McDonald's\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1952, brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald decided they needed a new building to house their hamburger restaurant in San Bernardino, California. They wanted this building to have an entirely new design which would achieve two goals: even greater efficiency, and an eye-catching appearance. They interviewed at least four architects altogether, finally choosing Stanley Clark Meston, an architect practicing in nearby Fontana, in late 1952. The arches had a direct bearing on the interviewing process and their choice of Meston: the first architect they interviewed objected to the arches the brothers wanted; a second wanted to change the arches; a third, prominent Los Angeles architect Douglas Honnold, said that if the brothers were going to tell him what to do they would be better off doing it themselves.[1]\\r\\nAlong with their practical knowledge, the brothers brought Meston a rough sketch of two half-circle arches drawn by Richard. The idea of an arch had struck Richard as a memorable shape to make their stand more visible. After considering one arch parallel to the front of the building, he had sketched two half-circles on either side of the stand.[1] Meston, together with his assistant Charles Fish, responded with a design which included two 25-foot (7.6?m) yellow sheet-metal arches trimmed in neon, called \\"golden arches\\" even at the design stage. His design also included a third, smaller arch sign at the roadside with a pudgy character in a chef's hat, known as Speedee, striding across the top, trimmed in animated neon.\\r\\nAccording to architectural historian Alan Hess, \\"Meston and Fish turned the crude half-circle suggested by Richard McDonald's sketch into a tapered, sophisticated parabola, with tense, springing lines conveying movement and energy.\\"[1] In the same article Hess added this footnote: \\"Who first suggested the parabola is unclear. Richard McDonald and George Dexter, the sign contractor who fabricated the first arches, recalled that Dexter came up with the idea and added them to the plans. Charles Fish, who did the working drawings and aided Meston in the design, attributes the idea to his familiarity with the form from a school project in which he used structural parabolas for a hangar. The form was one of many advanced engineering solutions, including folded plate roofs, that were in common currency.\\"[1]\\r\\nThe first franchised outlet bearing Meston's design opened in May 1953 in Phoenix, Arizona. Subsequent franchisees of the McDonald brothers were also required to use Meston's design, although Meston adapted the plans for each to the conditions and building codes of each site.[1]\\r\\nIn 1962, seeking to upgrade its image, the company sought a new logo. Fred Turner sketched a stylized \\"V\\", but the company's head of engineering and design, Jim Schindler, extended the \\"V\\" into an \\"M\\" resembling a McDonald's store viewed from an angle, with a red isosceles trapezoid \\"roof\\" serving as background for lettering.[2]\\r\\nWhile McDonald's dropped the physical arches from nearly all of its restaurants in the 1960s[citation needed], the Golden Arches have remained in the logo, and as a commonly understood term for the company. This was partially due to Louis Cheskin's argument that the arches, which he likened to \\"mother McDonald's breasts\\", had \\"Freudian applications to the subconscious mind of the consumer and were great assets in marketing McDonald's food.\\"[3] In Canada, all McDonald's stores and commercials have a maple leaf in the middle of the Golden Arches.\\r\\nAlan Hess summarized the arch's origin in Googie architecture and ultimate significance as follows:\\r\\nThe arch was conceived by businessman Richard McDonald, an untrained designer with no knowledge of erudite architectural examples. His intent was pragmatic: to be noticed. This determined its scale, position, and simple shape visible over long distances following the precedent of earlier drive-ins with which he was familiar. To McDonald, the arch was an arbitrary form, without symbolic or historic associations, which he hoped would come to symbolize McDonald's. The arches' position implies no traditional use of the arch as an entry, nor are they structural. The architect delineated this formal concept determined by the client in the energetic lines and machine-like surfaces of a popular commercial vernacular style current in the 1940s and 1950s ... Meston's design proved successful as design and icon because of, not in spite of, its commercialism.[1]\\r\\nThe term \\"Golden Arches\\" is sometimes used as metonym, symbolizing capitalism or globalization in phrases such as the \\"Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention\\", since McDonald's is one of the more prominent American corporations that have become global in their reach (along with Coca-Cola and Nike).\\r\\nThe McDonald's arches in Sedona, Arizona were made turquoise when the yellow colour had been deemed by government officials to be contrasting too much against the scenic red rock.[4]\\r\\nThe arches in the restaurant at 610 Del Monte Ave., Monterey, California, are in black.[5]\\r\\nThe restaurant at Champs-Elyses in Paris, France, includes a neon McDonald's sign with white arches. Also the new McDonald's in Bruges, Belgium, has the white arches.[6]","input":"What colour are the golden arches at the mcdonalds in sedona arizona?"},{"output":"over 125 million copies","context":"Fifty Shades of Grey is a 2011 erotic romance novel by British author E. L. James, originally a Twilight fan fiction with Christian Grey as a non-vampire Edward Cullen and Anastasia Steele as a wan, gamine Bella Swan.[1] It is the first instalment in the Fifty Shades trilogy that traces the deepening relationship between a college graduate, Anastasia Steele, and a young business magnate, Christian Grey. It is notable for its explicitly erotic scenes featuring elements of sexual practices involving bondage/discipline, dominance/submission, and sadism/masochism (BDSM). Originally self-published as an ebook and a print-on-demand, publishing rights were acquired by Vintage Books in March 2012.\\r\\nFifty Shades of Grey has topped best-seller lists around the world, selling over 125 million copies worldwide by June 2015. It has been translated into 52 languages, and set a record in the United Kingdom as the fastest-selling paperback of all time. Critical reception of the book, however, has tended towards the negative, with the quality of its prose generally seen as poor. Universal Pictures and Focus Features produced a film adaptation, which was released on 13 February 2015[2] and also received generally unfavourable reviews.\\r\\nThe second and third volumes of the trilogy, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, were published in 2012. Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey as Told by Christian, a version of Fifty Shades of Grey being told from Christian's point of view, was published in June 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnastasia \\"Ana\\" Steele is a 21-year-old college senior attending Washington State University in Vancouver, Washington. Her best friend is Katherine \\"Kate\\" Kavanagh, who writes for the college newspaper. Due to an illness, Kate is unable to interview 27-year-old Christian Grey, a successful and wealthy Seattle entrepreneur, and asks Ana to take her place. Ana finds Christian attractive as well as intimidating. As a result, she stumbles through the interview and leaves Christian's office believing it went poorly. Ana does not expect to meet Christian again, but he appears at the hardware store where she works. While he purchases various items including cable ties, masking tape, and rope, Ana informs Christian that Kate would like some photographs to illustrate her article about him. Christian gives Ana his phone number. Later, Kate urges Ana to call Christian and arrange a photo shoot with their photographer friend, Jos Rodriguez.\\r\\nThe next day Jos, Kate, and Ana arrive for the photo shoot at the Heathman Hotel, where Christian is staying. Christian asks Ana out for coffee and asks if she is dating anyone, specifically Jos. Ana replies that she is not dating anyone. During the conversation, Ana learns that Christian is also single, but he says he is not romantic. Ana is intrigued but believes she is not attractive enough for Christian. Later, Ana receives a package from Christian containing first edition copies of Tess of the d'Urbervilles, which stuns her. Later that night, Ana goes out drinking with her friends and ends up drunk dialling Christian, who informs her that he will be coming to pick her up because of her inebriated state. Ana goes outside to get some fresh air, and Jos attempts to kiss her, but he is stopped by Christian's arrival. Ana leaves with Christian, but not before she discovers that Kate has been flirting with Christian's brother, Elliot. Later, Ana wakes to find herself in Christian's hotel room, where he scolds her for not taking proper care of herself. Christian then reveals that he would like to have sex with her. He initially says that Ana will first have to fill in paperwork, but later goes back on this statement after making out with her in the elevator.\\r\\nAna goes on a date with Christian, on which he takes her in his helicopter, Charlie Tango, to his apartment. Once there, Christian insists that she sign a non-disclosure agreement forbidding her from discussing anything they do together, which Ana agrees to sign. He also mentions other paperwork, but first takes her to his playroom full of BDSM toys and gear. There, Christian informs her that the second contract will be one of dominance and submission, and there will be no romantic relationship, only a sexual one. The contract even forbids Ana from touching Christian or making eye contact with him. At this point, Christian realises that Ana is a virgin and agrees to take her virginity without making her sign the contract. The two then have sex. The following morning, Ana and Christian again have sex. His mother arrives moments after their sexual encounter and is surprised by the meeting, having previously thought Christian was homosexual, because he was never seen with a woman. Christian later takes Ana out to eat, and he reveals that he lost his virginity at age 15 to one of his mother's friends, Elena Lincoln, and that his previous dominant/submissive relationships failed due to incompatibility. Christian also reveals that in his first dominant/submissive relationship he was the submissive. Christian and Ana plan to meet again, and he takes Ana home, where she discovers several job offers and admits to Kate that she and Christian had sex.\\r\\nOver the next few days, Ana receives several packages from Christian. These include a laptop to enable her to research the BDSM lifestyle in consideration of the contract; to communicate with him, since she has never previously owned a computer; and to receive a more detailed version of the dominant/submissive contract. She and Christian email each other, with Ana teasing him and refusing to honour parts of the contract, such as only eating foods from a specific list. Ana later meets with Christian to discuss the contract and becomes overwhelmed by the potential BDSM arrangement and the potential of having a sexual relationship with Christian that is not romantic in nature. Because of these feelings, Ana runs away from Christian and does not see him again until her college graduation, where he is a guest speaker. During this time, Ana agrees to sign the dominant/submissive contract. Ana and Christian once again meet to further discuss the contract, and they go over Ana's hard and soft limits. Christian spanks Ana for the first time, and the experience leaves her both enticed and slightly confused. This confusion is exacerbated by Christian's lavish gifts and the fact that he brings her to meet his family. The two continue with the arrangement without Ana's having yet signed the contract. After successfully landing a job with Seattle Independent Publishing (SIP), Ana further bristles under the restrictions of the non-disclosure agreement and her complex relationship with Christian. The tension between Ana and Christian eventually comes to a head after Ana asks Christian to punish her in order to show her how extreme a BDSM relationship with him could be. Christian fulfils Ana's request, beating her with a belt, and Ana realises they are incompatible. Devastated, she breaks up with Christian and returns to the apartment she shares with Kate.\\r\\nThe Fifty Shades trilogy was developed from a Twilight fan fiction series originally titled Master of the Universe and published episodically on fan-fiction websites under the pen name \\"Snowqueen's Icedragon\\". The piece featured characters named after Stephenie Meyer's characters in Twilight, Edward Cullen and Bella Swan. After comments concerning the sexual nature of the material, James removed the story from the fan-fiction websites and published it on her own website, FiftyShades.com. Later she rewrote Master of the Universe as an original piece, with the principal characters renamed Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele and removed it from her website before publication.[3] Meyer commented on the series, saying \\"that's really not my genre, not my thing... Good on hershe's doing well. That's great!\\"[4]\\r\\nThis reworked and extended version of Master of the Universe was split into three parts. The first, titled Fifty Shades of Grey, was released as an e-book and a print on demand paperback in May 2011 by The Writers' Coffee Shop, a virtual publisher based in Australia.[5][6] The second volume, Fifty Shades Darker, was released in September 2011; and the third, Fifty Shades Freed, followed in January 2012. The Writers' Coffee Shop had a restricted marketing budget and relied largely on book blogs for early publicity, but sales of the novel were boosted by word-of-mouth recommendation. The book's erotic nature and perceived demographic of its fan base as being composed largely of married women over thirty led to the book being dubbed \\"Mommy Porn\\" by some news agencies.[7][8] The book has also reportedly been popular among teenage girls and college women.[8][9][10] By the release of the final volume in January 2012, news networks in the United States had begun to report on the Fifty Shades trilogy as an example of viral marketing and of the rise in popularity of female erotica, attributing its success to the discreet nature of e-reading devices.[11][12] Due to the heightened interest in the series, the license to the Fifty Shades trilogy was picked up by Vintage Books for re-release in a new and revised edition in April 2012.[13][14] The attention that the series has garnered has also helped to spark a renewed interest in erotic literature. Many other erotic works quickly became best-sellers following Fifty Shade's success, while other popular works, such as Anne Rice's The Sleeping Beauty trilogy, have been reissued (this time without pseudonyms) to meet the higher demand.[15]\\r\\nOn 1 August 2012, Amazon UK announced that it had sold more copies of Fifty Shades of Grey than it had the entire Harry Potter series combined, making E. L. James its best-selling author, replacing J. K. Rowling, though worldwide the Harry Potter series sold more than 450 million copies compared with Fifty Shades of Grey's sales of 60 million copies.[16]\\r\\nFifty Shades of Grey has topped best-seller lists around the world, including those of the United Kingdom and the United States.[17][18] The series had sold over 125 million copies worldwide by June 2015 and has been translated into 52 languages,[19][20] and set a record in the United Kingdom as the fastest-selling paperback of all time.[21]\\r\\nIt has received mixed to negative reviews, with most critics noting poor literary qualities of the work. Salman Rushdie said about the book: \\"I've never read anything so badly written that got published. It made Twilight look like War and Peace.\\"[22] Maureen Dowd described the book in The New York Times as being written \\"like a Bronte devoid of talent,\\" and said it was \\"dull and poorly written.\\"[23] Jesse Kornbluth of The Huffington Post said: \\"As a reading experience, Fifty Shades?... is a sad joke, puny of plot\\".[24]\\r\\nPrinceton professor April Alliston wrote, \\"Though no literary masterpiece, Fifty Shades is more than parasitic fan fiction based on the recent Twilight vampire series.\\"[25] Entertainment Weekly writer Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the book a \\"B+\\" rating and praised it for being \\"in a class by itself.\\"[26] British author Jenny Colgan in The Guardian wrote \\"It is jolly, eminently readable and as sweet and safe as BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism) erotica can be without contravening the trade descriptions act\\" and also praised the book for being \\"more enjoyable\\" than other \\"literary erotic books\\".[27] The Daily Telegraph noted that the book was \\"the definition of a page-turner\\", noting that the book was both \\"troubling and intriguing\\".[28] A reviewer for the Ledger-Enquirer described the book as guilty fun and escapism, and that it \\"also touches on one aspect of female existence [female submission]. And acknowledging that fact ÿ maybe even appreciating it ÿ shouldn't be a cause for guilt.\\"[29] The New Zealand Herald stated that the book \\"will win no prizes for its prose\\" and that \\"there are some exceedingly awful descriptions,\\" although it was also an easy read; \\"(If you only) can suspend your disbelief and your desire to ÿ if you'll pardon the expression ÿ slap the heroine for having so little self respect, you might enjoy it.\\"[30] The Columbus Dispatch stated that, \\"Despite the clunky prose, James does cause one to turn the page.\\"[31] Metro News Canada wrote that \\"suffering through 500 pages of this heroine's inner dialogue was torturous, and not in the intended, sexy kind of way\\".[32] Jessica Reaves, of the Chicago Tribune, wrote that the \\"book's source material isn't great literature\\", noting that the novel is \\"sprinkled liberally and repeatedly with asinine phrases\\", and described it as \\"depressing\\".[33]\\r\\nThe book garnered some accolades. In December 2012, it won both \\"Popular Fiction\\" and \\"Book of the Year\\" categories in the UK National Book Awards.[34][35] In that same month, Publishers Weekly named E. L. James the 'Publishing Person of the Year', a decision whose criticism in the LA Times and the New York Daily News was referred to by and summarised in The Christian Science Monitor.[36] Earlier, in April 2012, when E. L. James was listed as one of Time magazine's \\"100 Most Influential People in the World\\",[37] Richard Lawson of The Atlantic Wire criticised her inclusion due to the trilogy's fan fiction beginnings.[38]\\r\\nFifty Shades of Grey has attracted criticism due to its depictions of BDSM, with some BDSM participants stating that the book confuses BDSM with abuse and presents it as a pathology to be overcome, as well as showing incorrect and possibly dangerous BDSM techniques.[39][40]\\r\\nCoinciding with the release of the book and its surprising popularity, injuries related to BDSM and sex toy use spiked dramatically. In 2012, the year after the book was published, injuries requiring Emergency Room visits increased by over 50% from 2010 (the year before the book was published). This is speculated to be due to people unfamiliar with both the proper use of these toys and the safe practice of bondage and other \\"kinky\\" sexual fetishes attempting what they had read in the book.[41]\\r\\nThere has also been criticism against the fact that BDSM is part of the book. Archbishop Dennis Schnurr of Cincinnati said in an early February 2015 letter, \\"The story line is presented as a romance; however, the underlying theme is that bondage, dominance, and sadomasochism are normal and pleasurable.\\"[42] The feminist anti-pornography organisation Stop Porn Culture called for a boycott of the movie based on the book because of its sex scenes involving bondage and violence.[43] By contrast, Timothy Laurie and Jessica Kean argue that \\"film fleshes out an otherwise legalistic concept like 'consent' into a living, breathing, and at times, uncomfortable interpersonal experience,\\" and \\"dramatises the dangers of unequal negotiation and the practical complexity of identifying one's limits and having them respected.\\"[44]\\r\\nSeveral critics and scientists have expressed concern that the nature of the main couple's relationship is not BDSM at all, but rather is characteristic of an abusive relationship. In 2013, social scientist Professor Amy E. Bonomi published a study wherein the books were read by multiple professionals and assessed for characteristics of intimate partner violence, or IPV, using the CDC's standards for emotional abuse and sexual violence. The study found that nearly every interaction between Ana and Christian was emotionally abusive in nature, including stalking, intimidation, and isolation. The study group also observed pervasive sexual violence within the CDC's definition, including Christian's use of alcohol to circumvent Ana's ability to consent, and that Ana exhibits classic signs of an abused woman, including constant perceived threat, stressful managing, and altered identity.[45][46]\\r\\nA second study in 2014 was conducted to examine the health of women who had read the series, compared with a control group that had never read any part of the novels. The results showed a correlation between having read at least the first book and exhibiting signs of an eating disorder, having romantic partners that were emotionally abusive and/or engaged in stalking behaviour, engaging in binge drinking in the last month, and having 5 or more sexual partners before age 24. The authors could not conclude whether women already experiencing these \\"problems\\" were drawn to the series, or if the series influenced these behaviours to occur after reading by creating underlying context.[47] The study's lead researcher contends that the books romanticise dangerous behaviour and \\"perpetuate dangerous abuse standards.\\"[48] The study was limited in that only women up to age 24 were studied, and no distinction was made among the reader sample between women who enjoyed the series and those that had a strong negative opinion of it, having only read it out of curiosity due to the media hype or other obligation.[49]\\r\\nAt the beginning of the media hype, Dr. Drew and sexologist Logan Levkoff discussed on The Today Show[50] whether the book perpetuated violence against women; Levkoff said that while that is an important subject, this trilogy had nothing to do with it?ÿ this was a book about a consensual relationship. Dr. Drew commented that the book was \\"horribly written\\" in addition to being \\"disturbing\\" but stated that \\"if the book enhances women's real-life sex lives and intimacy, so be it.\\"[51]\\r\\nIn March 2012, branches of the public library in Brevard County, Florida, removed copies of Fifty Shades of Grey from their shelves, with an official stating that it did not meet the selection criteria for the library and that reviews for the book had been poor. A representative for the library stated that it was due to the book's sexual content and that other libraries had declined to purchase copies for their branches.[52] Deborah Caldwell-Stone of the American Library Association commented that \\"If the only reason you don't select a book is that you disapprove of its content, but there is demand for it, there's a question of whether you're being fair.

He played college basketball for Creighton and was drafted with the 51st overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft by the New Jersey Nets. Korver became an NBA All-Star for the first time in 2015, and holds the NBA record for the highest three-point field goal percentage in a season (with 53.6%).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKorver was born in Paramount, California[2] and is the oldest of four children of Kevin and Laine Korver. He grew up in the Los Angeles area, and was a Los Angeles Lakers fan as a child. Watching Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and the Showtime Lakers instilled a love of basketball in Korver that made him want to pursue it himself.[3] He moved with his family to Iowa in 1993 and graduated from Pella High School.\\r\\nAs a freshman at Creighton, Korver was named to the MVC All-Bench, All-Freshman and All-Newcomer teams after he averaged 8.8 points per game while hitting 43.4 percent from three-point range and 89.5 percent at the free-throw line.[4]\\r\\nAs a sophomore, Korver earned All-MVC second team honors while leading the conference tournament champion Bluejays with 14.6 points per game. He was also named to the MVC All-Tournament team.[4]\\r\\nAs a junior, Korver led the Bluejays to both the Missouri Valley Conference regular season and conference tournament championships. He was then named MVC Player of the Year and an honorable mention All-American.[4] As a senior, Korver again earned MVC Player of the Year and first team All-MVC honors. He was also a consensus second-team All-American and a finalist for the Wooden, Naismith, and Oscar Robertson awards.\\r\\nKorver finished his career at Creighton fourth all-time in scoring (1,801) and first in three-pointers made (371), three-point percentage (45.3), and free-throw percentage (89.1).[4] His 371 career made three-pointers is an MVC record and tied for sixth most in NCAA history. Korver also holds Creighton single-season records for three-pointers made (129), three-point percentage (.480), and free-throw percentage (.908).[4][5]\\r\\nKorver graduated with a bachelor's degree in visual communications.[6]\\r\\nKorver was selected with the 51st overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft by the New Jersey Nets. His draft rights were traded later that night to the Philadelphia 76ers for $125,000.[7] On August 8, 2003, he signed a two-year deal with the 76ers. Korver finished his rookie season averaging 4.1 points in 11.9 minutes per game.\\r\\nKorver finished the 2004ÿ05 season tied for the NBA league leader in three-pointers made with 226, which also marked a 76ers franchise record.[8]\\r\\nOn August 2, 2005, Korver re-signed with the 76ers to a six-year, $25 million contract.[9] Korver scored a career-high 31 points against the Milwaukee Bucks on February 24, 2006,[10] and duplicated that performance on February 21, 2007 against the New York Knicks.[11] He averaged a career-high 14.4 points per game during the 2006ÿ07 season, and led the NBA in free-throw percentage with 91.4 percent.\\r\\nOn December 29, 2007, Korver was traded to the Utah Jazz in exchange for Gordan Giri?ek and a future first-round draft pick.[8][12]\\r\\nKorver spent two and a half seasons in Utah, mostly coming off the bench as the team's sixth man. Korver finished the 2009ÿ10 season hitting 53.6 percent of his three-point shots to secure the NBA's single-season accuracy record.[13] He drilled 59-of-110 three-pointers, edging the record percentage of .524 that Steve Kerr set in 1994ÿ95. Korver played in just 52 games for the Jazz in 2009ÿ10, but his spot-on shooting surged after he finally returned fully healthy after the All-Star break, having struggled with wrist and knee issues following surgeries to both in 2009.[13]\\r\\nOn July 13, 2010, Korver signed with the Chicago Bulls.[14] In 2010ÿ11, Korver, for the third time in his career, appeared in 82 games (all coming off the bench), and averaged 8.3 points, 1.8 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 20.1 minutes (.434 FG%, .415 3FG%, .885 FT%). The Bulls finished first in the Eastern Conference in 2011, and advanced to the Conference Finals where they were defeated by the Miami Heat 4ÿ1.\\r\\nOn March 10, 2012, Korver arguably had his best game as a Bull, recording 26 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists in a 111ÿ97 win over his former team, the Utah Jazz.[15]\\r\\nOn July 16, 2012, Korver was traded to the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for cash considerations.[16] In 2012ÿ13, he averaged 10.9 points in 30.5 minutes per game, while recording percentages of .461 FG%, .457 3FG%, and .859 FT%. He finished second in the NBA in three-point percentage and fourth in three-point field goals made with 189. He made at least one three-pointer in his final 73 games of the season, the longest active streak in the NBA at the time, a career-best and the fourth longest streak in league history (Dana Barros 89, Michael Adams 79, Dennis Scott 78). In addition, his 189 made threes was the fourth-best single season total in franchise history.[5]\\r\\nOn July 12, 2013, Korver re-signed with the Hawks[17] to a four-year, $24 million contract. On December 6, 2013, Korver passed the NBA record for most consecutive games with a made three-pointer (90) originally set by Dana Barros (89).[18][19] The streak eventually ended at 127 games on March 5, 2014.[20] Korver finished the 2013ÿ14 season with a 47.2 percent three-point shooting percentage which led the NBA.\\r\\nOn December 15, 2014, Korver passed Jason Richardson for 15th all-time in three-pointers made.[21] Five days later, in the Hawks' 104ÿ97 win over the Houston Rockets, Korver scored a game-high 22 points and made all four of his free-throw attempts. This gave him 49 consecutive made free-throws on the season to set a new Hawks franchise record.[22] The streak ended at 50 in the Hawks' next game against the Dallas Mavericks. On February 10, 2015, Korver received his first NBA All-Star selection as a reserve for the Eastern Conference in the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, replacing the injured Dwyane Wade. At 33 years and 11 months old, he became the fourth-oldest first-time All-Star.[23] On March 11, in a loss to the Denver Nuggets, Korver passed Kobe Bryant for 12th on the all-time three-pointers made list.[24] Four days later, in a win over the Los Angeles Lakers, Korver left the game with a broken nose after taking an offensive foul from Ed Davis with 8:59 left in the first half. The injury ended a streak of 51 consecutive games with a three-pointer by Korver, who missed both of his shots from behind the arc.[25] After missing three games with the injury, he returned to action on March 22 against the San Antonio Spurs with protective gear on his face to cover the nose.[26]\\r\\nOn April 29, 2015, Korver was named the recipient of the Joe Dumars Trophy for winning the 2014ÿ15 NBA Sportsmanship Award.[27] During the 2015 playoffs, Korver suffered a right ankle sprain playing against the Cleveland Cavaliers on May 22 in the Eastern Conference Finals. The following day, he was ruled out for the rest of the playoffs.[28]\\r\\nOn November 6, 2015, Korver scored 22 points, hitting all eight of his shots, including four from three-point range, as the Hawks won their sixth straight with a 121ÿ115 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans.[29] On December 26, in a win over the New York Knicks, Korver hit one three-pointer and passed Rashard Lewis for ninth place on the all-time list for three-pointers made.[30] However, his late December shooting slump marked one of the worst shooting stretches of his career. In four games between December 23ÿ29, Korver shot 5-of-33 from the field and a woeful 2-of-27 from three-point range.[31] Korver continued to struggle with his shot in January, missing all six of his shots on January 31 against the Miami Heat, marking just the third time in his career that he went 0-of-6 or worse as a starter. Over 47 games to begin the season, his 42% field goal shooting was the worst it had been since the 2004ÿ05 season, and his 37% three-point shooting was a career-low success rate.[32]\\r\\nOn December 16, 2016, Korver scored a season-high 19 points and hit a season-high six three-pointers in a 125ÿ121 win over the Toronto Raptors. The win gave the Hawks a 13ÿ13 record after 26 games; they began the season 9ÿ2.[33] He set a new season high on December 30, scoring 22 points in 29 minutes off the bench in a 105ÿ98 win over the Detroit Pistons.[34]\\r\\nOn January 7, 2017, Korver was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Mike Dunleavy, Mo Williams, cash considerations and a protected future first round draft pick.[35] He made his debut for the Cavaliers three days later, recording two points and three rebounds in 17 minutes off the bench in a 100ÿ92 loss to the Utah Jazz.[36] Korver went 2-of-10 over his first two games for the Cavaliers, with both games resulting in losses. On January 13, he scored 18 points off the bench to help the Cavaliers defeat the Sacramento Kings 120ÿ108.[37] On February 1, he had his best game as a Cavalier, scoring 20 points off the bench on 8-of-11 from the field with four three-pointers in a 125ÿ97 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.[38] On February 8, Korver scored a season-high 29 points on 10-of-12 from the field and 8-of-9 from the three-point line in a 132ÿ117 win over the Indiana Pacers. He subsequently passed Jason Kidd (1,988) for seventh on the all-time three-pointers made list.[39] A week later, on February 15, also against the Pacers, Korver became the seventh player in NBA history to make 2,000 career three-pointers, joining Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, Jason Terry, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, and Jamal Crawford.[40] On April 4, 2017, he returned after missing 11 games with a sore left foot and scored 11 points in 12 minutes in a 122ÿ102 win over the Orlando Magic.[41] Korver helped the Cavaliers go 12ÿ1 over the first three rounds of the playoffs to reach the 2017 NBA Finals. There they faced the Golden State Warriors and were defeated in five games.\\r\\nOn July 12, 2017, Korver re-signed with the Cavaliers.[42]\\r\\nKorver has three brothers, Kirk, Kaleb, and Klayton, all of whom have played Division I basketball. Klayton was a guard/forward for the Drake Bulldogs while Kaleb was a guard for the Creighton Bluejays. Kirk currently plays forward at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.[3] His mother Laine played high-school basketball and once scored 74 points in a game.[1][5] Korver's father, Kevin, is a pastor in Pella, Iowa. Korver's uncle, Kris Korver, is the head basketball coach at Northwestern College in Orange City, Iowa.[3] His cousin Kari Korver plays for the UCLA Bruins women's basketball team.[45]\\r\\nKorver married Juliet Richardson on August 10, 2011.[46] Their daughter, Kyra Elyse, was born on December 5, 2012.[47] His wife delivered their first boy, Knox Elliot, on October 4, 2014.[48] Their second son, Koen, was born in November 7, 2016.[49]\\r\\nKorver is a Christian. Korver has spoken about his faith in Jesus saying, \\"He is the one who came and paid for my sins that I may get to heaven someday and be with Him. He is my example. Hes my everything.\\"[50]\\r\\nKorver has his own charitable foundation, called the \\"Kyle Korver Foundation\\", which contributes to many philanthropic causes.[51] He held a coat drive while with the 76ers, where he collected and donated coats to kids in need.[5] Korver added a new line of clothing called \\"Sheer Outfitters\\" that is connected with his foundation KKF to help the underprivilaged children.[52] In 2013, he started an annual sock drive in October called the \\"Socktober Drive\\" in which he collects socks to donate to homeless people in Atlanta.

Indeed, after the ratification of the Constitution, some opponents of a strong federal judiciary urged that, outside jurisdictions under direct federal control like Washington, D.C. and the territories, the federal court system be limited to the Supreme Court, which would hear appeals from state courts.

The number of judges in each district court (and the structure of the judicial system generally) is set by Congress in the United States Code. The President appoints the federal judges for terms of good behavior (subject to the advice and consent of the Senate), so the nominees often share at least some of his or her convictions. In states represented by a senator of the President's party, the senator (or the more senior of them if both senators are of the president's party) has substantial input into the nominating process, and through a tradition known as senatorial courtesy can exercise an unofficial veto over a nominee unacceptable to the senator.\\r\\nWith the exception of the territorial courts (Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands), federal district judges are Article III judges appointed for life, and can be removed involuntarily only when they violate the standard of \\"good behavior\\". The sole method of involuntary removal of a judge is through impeachment by the United States House of Representatives followed by a trial in the United States Senate and a conviction by a two-thirds vote. Otherwise, a judge, even if convicted of a felony criminal offense by a jury, is entitled to hold office until retirement or death. In the history of the United States, only twelve judges have been impeached by the House, and only seven have been removed following conviction in the Senate. (For a table that includes the twelve impeached judges, see Impeachment in the United States.)\\r\\nA judge who has reached the age of 65 (or has become disabled) may retire or elect to go on senior status and keep working. Such senior judges are not counted in the quota of active judges for the district and do only whatever work they are assigned by the chief judge of the district, but they keep their offices (called \\"chambers\\") and staff, and many of them work full-time. A federal judge is addressed in writing as \\"The Honorable John/Jane Doe\\" or \\"Hon. John/Jane Doe\\" and in speech as \\"Judge\\" or \\"Judge Doe\\" or, when presiding in court, \\"Your Honor\\".\\r\\nDistrict judges usually concentrate on managing their court's overall caseload, supervising trials, and writing opinions in response to important motions like the motion for summary judgment. Since the 1960s, routine tasks like resolving discovery disputes can, in the district judge's discretion, be referred to magistrate judges. Magistrate judges can also be requested to prepare reports and recommendations on contested matters for the district judge's consideration or, with the consent of all parties, to assume complete jurisdiction over a case including conducting the trial.\\r\\nFederal magistrate judges are appointed by each district court pursuant to statute. They are appointed for an eight-year term and may be reappointed for additional eight-year terms. A magistrate judge may be removed \\"for incompetency, misconduct, neglect of duty, or physical or mental disability\\".[5] A magistrate judgeship may be a stepping stone to a district judgeship nomination.\\r\\nAs of 2010, there were 678 authorized district court judgeships.[6] A study put forth by Brennan Center for Justice at New York University of Law found that under the Obama administration and especially in the year 2009 there have been a \\"uniquely high\\" number of vacancies in Federal Court, averaging 60 or more from the years 2009 to 2013. The Obama administration has blamed Senate Republicans for opposing (and therefore, not confirming) presidential nominations, while the Republicans say Obama has been slow to nominate.[7]\\r\\nUnlike some state courts, the power of federal courts to hear cases and controversies is strictly limited. Federal courts may not decide every case that happens to come before them. In order for a district court to entertain a lawsuit, Congress must first grant the court subject matter jurisdiction over the type of dispute in question.\\r\\nThe district courts exercise original jurisdiction overthat is, they are empowered to conduct trials inthe following types of cases:\\r\\nFor most of these cases, the jurisdiction of the federal district courts is concurrent with that of the state courts. In other words, a plaintiff can choose to bring these cases in either a federal district court or a state court. Congress has established a procedure whereby a party, typically the defendant, can \\"remove\\" a case from state court to federal court, provided that the federal court also has original jurisdiction over the matter (meaning that the case could have been filed in federal court initially).[14] If the party that initially filed the case in state court believes that removal was improper, that party can ask the district court to \\"remand\\" the case to the state court system. For certain matters, such as patent and copyright infringement disputes and prosecutions for federal crimes, the jurisdiction of the district courts is exclusive of that of the state courts, meaning that only federal courts can hear those cases.[note 2]\\r\\nIn addition to their original jurisdiction, the district courts have appellate jurisdiction over a very limited class of judgments, orders, and decrees.[15]\\r\\nIn order to represent a party in a case in a district court, a person must be an attorney at law and generally must be admitted to the bar of that particular court. The United States usually does not have a separate bar examination for federal practice (except with respect to patent practice before the United States Patent and Trademark Office). Admission to the bar of a district court is generally available to any attorney who is admitted to practice law in the state where the district court sits.[note 3]\\r\\n56 districts (around 60% of all district courts) require an attorney to be admitted to practice in the state where the district court sits. The other 39 districts (around 40% of all district courts) extend admission to certain lawyers admitted in other states, although conditions vary from court to court. For example, the district courts in New York City (Southern District of New York and Eastern District of New York) extend admission to attorneys admitted to the bar in Connecticut or Vermont and to the district court in that state, but otherwise require attorneys to be admitted to the New York bar. Only 13 districts extend admission to attorneys admitted to any U.S. state bar.[16]\\r\\nThe attorney generally submits an application with a fee and takes the oath of admission. Local practice varies as to whether the oath is given in writing or in open court before a judge of the district. A \\"sponsor\\" admitted to the court's bar is often required. Several district courts require attorneys seeking admission to their bars to take an additional bar examination on federal law, including the following: the Southern District of Ohio,[17] the Northern District of Florida,[18] and the District of Puerto Rico.[19]\\r\\nPro hac vice admission is also available in most federal district courts on a case-by-case basis. Most district courts require pro hac vice attorneys to associate with an attorney admitted to practice before the court.[16]\\r\\nGenerally, a final ruling by a district court in either a civil or a criminal case can be appealed to the United States court of appeals in the federal judicial circuit in which the district court is located, except that some district court rulings involving patents and certain other specialized matters must be appealed instead to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and in a very few cases the appeal may be taken directly to the United States Supreme Court.\\r\\nThe Central District of California is the largest federal district by population;[20] it includes all five counties that make up the Greater Los Angeles Area. By contrast, New York City and the surrounding metropolitan area are divided between the Southern District of New York (which includes Manhattan, The Bronx and Westchester County) and the Eastern District of New York (which includes Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Nassau County and Suffolk County). New York suburbs in Connecticut and New Jersey are covered by the District of Connecticut and District of New Jersey, respectively.\\r\\nThe Southern District of New York and the Central District of California are the largest federal districts by number of judges, with 28 and 27, respectively.[21]\\r\\nIn 2007, the busiest district courts in terms of criminal federal felony filings were the District of New Mexico, Western District of Texas, Southern District of Texas, and the District of Arizona. These four districts all share the border with Mexico.[22] A crackdown on illegal immigration resulted in 75 percent of the criminal cases filed in the 94 district courts in 2007 being filed in these four districts and the other district that borders Mexico, the Southern District of California.[23] The busiest patent litigation court is the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, with the most patent lawsuits filed there nearly every year.[24]\\r\\nMost extinct district courts have disappeared by being divided into smaller districts. The following courts were subdivided out of existence: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin.\\r\\nOn rare occasions, an extinct district court was extinguished by merging it with other district courts. In every case except one, this has restored a district court that had been subdivided:\\r\\nThere are a few additional extinct district courts that fall into neither of the above two patterns.","input":"What kinds of cases are heard in district court?"},{"output":"Bianca Taylor Ryan","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBianca Taylor Ryan (born September 1, 1994)[1] is an American singer-songwriter, musician and actress from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The first four books of the Odyssey focus on Telemachus's journeys in search of news about his father, who has yet to return home from the Trojan War, and are traditionally given the title the Telemachy.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTelemachus's name in Greek means \\"far from battle\\", or perhaps \\"fighting from afar\\", as a bowman does.[2]\\r\\nIn Homer's Odyssey, Telemachus, under the instructions of Athena, spends the first four books trying to gain knowledge of his father, Odysseus, who left for Troy when Telemachus was still an infant. At the outset of Telemachus' journey, Odysseus had been absent from his home at Ithaca for twenty years due to the Trojan War and the intervention of Poseidon. During his absence, Odysseus' house has been occupied by hordes of suitors seeking the hand of Penelope.[3] Telemachus first visits Nestor and is well received by the old man who regales him with stories of his father's glory. Telemachus then departs with Nestor's son Peisistratus,[4] who accompanies him to the halls of Menelaus and his wife Helen. Whilst there, Telemachus is again treated as an honored guest as Menelaus and Helen tell complementary yet contradictory stories of his father's exploits at Troy.[5]\\r\\nTelemachus focuses on his father's return to Ithaca in Book XV. He visits Eumaeus, the swineherd, who happens to be hosting a disguised Odysseus. After Odysseus reveals himself to Telemachus due to Athena's advice, the two men plan the downfall of the suitors. Telemachus then returns to the palace to keep an eye on the suitors and to await his father as the beggar.[6]\\r\\nWhen Penelope challenges the suitors to string Odysseus' bow and shoot an arrow through the handle-holes of twelve axeheads, Telemachus is the first to attempt the task. He would have completed the task, nearly stringing the bow on his fourth attempt; however, Odysseus subtly stops him before he can finish his attempt. Following the suitors' failure at this task, Odysseus reveals himself and he and Telemachus bring swift and bloody death to the suitors.[7]\\r\\nThe Telegony was a short two-book epic poem recounting the life and death of Odysseus after the events of the Odyssey. In this mythological postscript, Odysseus is accidentally killed by Telegonus, his unknown son by the goddess Circe. After Odysseus' death, Telemachus returns to Aeaea with Telegonus and Penelope, and there marries Circe.\\r\\nFrom the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology:\\r\\nThe son of Odysseus and Penelope (Hom. Od. i. 216). He was still an infant at the time when his father went to Troy, and in his absence of nearly twenty years he grew up to manhood. After the gods in council had determined that Odysseus should return home from the island of Ogygia, Athena, assuming the appearance of Mentes, king of the Taphians, went to Ithaca, and advised Telemachus to eject the troublesome suitors of his mother from his house, and to go to Pylos and Sparta, to gather information concerning his father. Telemachus followed the advice, but the suitors refused to quit his house; and Athena, in the form of Mentes, accompanied Telemachus to Pylos. There they were hospitably received by Nestor, who also sent his own son to conduct Telemachus to Sparta. Menelaus again kindly received him, and communicated to him the prophecy of Proteus concerning Odysseus (Hom. Od. i.ÿiv.). From Sparta Telemachus returned home; and on his arrival there, he found his father, with the swineherd Eumaeus. But as Athena had metamorphosed him into a beggar, Telemachus did not recognise his father until the latter disclosed to him who he was. Father and son now agreed to punish the suitors; and when they were slain or dispersed, Telemachus accompanied his father to the aged Laertes. (Hom. Od. xv.ÿxxiv.; comp. Odysseus.) In the post-Homeric traditions, we read that Palamedes, when endeavouring to persuade Odysseus to join the Greeks against Troy, and the latter feigned idiocy, placed the infant Telemachus before the plough with which Odysseus was ploughing (Hygin. Fab. 95; Serv. ad Aen. ii. 81; Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 384; Aelian, V. H. xiii. 12.). According to some accounts, Telemachus became the father of Perseptolis either by Polycaste, the daughter of Nestor, or by Nausicaa, the daughter of Alcinous (Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1796; Dict. Cret. vi. 6.). Others relate that he was induced by Athena to marry Circe, and became by her the father of Latinus (Hygin. Fab. 127; comp. Telegonus), or that he married Cassiphone, a daughter of Circe, but in a quarrel with his mother-in-law he slew her, for which in his turn he was killed by Cassiphone (Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 808.). He is also said to have had a daughter called Roma, who married Aeneas (Serv. ad Aen. i. 273.). One account states that Odysseus, in consequence of a prophecy that his son was dangerous to him, sent him away from Ithaca. Servius (ad Aen. x. 167) makes Telemachus the founder of the town of Clusium in Etruria.\\r\\nIn Contest of Homer and Hesiod, it is alleged that the Roman Emperor Hadrian asked the Delphic Oracle about Homer's birthplace and parentage. The Oracle replied that Homer came from Ithaca and that Telemachus was his father by Epicasta, daughter of Nestor.[8][9]\\r\\nAccording to Aristotle and Dictys of Crete, Telemachus married Nausicaa, King Alcinous' daughter, and fathered a son named Perseptolis or Ptoliporthus.[citation needed]\\r\\nTelemachus is the subject of Fran?ois Fnelon's The Adventures of Telemachus, Son of Ulysses (1699), a scathing attack on the monarchy of France.\\r\\nTelemachus was the subject of numerous operas throughout the eighteenth century, most based on Fnelon's version.[10] Among the most famous of these operas were Andr Cardinal Destouches's Tlmaque (1714), Alessandro Scarlatti's Telemaco (1718), Gluck's Telemaco, ossia L'isola di Circe (1765), Giuseppe Gazzaniga's Gli errori di Telemaco (1776), Jean-Fran?ois Le Sueur's Tlmaque dans l'?le de Calypso ou Le triomphe de la sagesse (1796), Simon Mayr's Telemaco nell'isola di Calipso (1797), and Fernando Sor's Telemaco nell'isola di Calipso (1797).\\r\\nTelemachus is one of the main characters in Ulysses, a 1706 play by Nicholas Rowe.\\r\\nTelemachus is featured in the 1833 poem (published in 1842) \\"Ulysses\\" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson.\\r\\nIn the 1922 novel Ulysses by James Joyce, Stephen Dedalus is generally regarded as corresponding to Telemachus.\\r\\n\\"Telemachus\\" is the title of Book Three of Thomas Wolfe's autobiographical novel Of Time and the River (1935).\\r\\nJoseph Brodsky published the poem \\"Odysseus to Telemachus\\" in 1972.\\r\\nTelemachus is a frequent character in the poetry of Louise Glck.[11]\\r\\nTelemachus was the name of Carole King's cat and is pictured on the cover of her album Tapestry.[12]\\r\\nTelemachus appears as the son of Ulysses in the 1981 French-Japanese animated television series Ulysses 31.","input":"How old is telemachus at the start of the odyssey?"},{"output":"Alaska","context":"The United States has 154 protected areas known as National Forests covering 188,336,179 acres (762,169?km2/294,275 sq. mi).[1] The National Forests are managed by the U.S. Forest Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.[2] The first National Forest was established as the Yellowstone Park Timber and Land Reserve on March 30, 1891, then in the Department of the Interior. In 1897, the Organic Act provided purposes for which forest reserves could be established, including to protect the forest, secure water supplies, and supply timber. With the Forest Reserve Act of 1891, the President of the United States was given the power to set aside forest reserves in the public domain. With the Transfer Act of 1905, forest reserves became part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the newly created U.S. Forest Service.[3][4]\\r\\nBy 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt more than doubled the forest reserve acreage, and Congress responded by limiting the Presidents ability to proclaim new reserves. The National Forest System underwent a major reorganization in 1908, and in 1911 Congress authorized new additions to the system under the authority of the Weeks Act. The management goals provided by the Organic Act were expanded upon by the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 to include outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes as well as for the establishment of wilderness areas.[3][4]\\r\\nAs of September 30, 2014, the Forest Service manages a total 192,922,127 acres (780,728.15?km2), 188,336,179 acres (762,169.48?km2) of which are National Forests. The additional land areas include 20 National Grasslands, 59 purchase units, 19 research and experimental areas, five land utilization projects and 37 other areas. The National Forest System has an extensive and complicated history of reorganization, so while there are currently 154 named National Forests, many of these are managed together as either a single forest or separate forests.[A][1][4][5]\\r\\nThere is at least one National Forest in all but ten states: Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Dakota, New Jersey, and Rhode Island (although Kansas and North Dakota have national grasslands). In addition, Puerto Rico contains El Yunque National Forest.

Idaho also has the greatest percent of its land in national forests with 38.2%, followed by Oregon with 24.7% and Colorado with 20.9%. On maps, national forests in the west generally show the true extent of their area, but those in the east often only show purchase districts, within which usually only a minority of the land is owned by the Forest Service.[1]","input":"What is the largest national forest in the united states?"},{"output":"fewer than 37 weeks' gestational age","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nPreterm birth, also known as premature birth, is the birth of a baby at fewer than 37 weeks' gestational age.[1] These babies are known as preemies or premies.[1] Symptoms of preterm labor include uterine contractions which occur more often than every ten minutes or the leaking of fluid from the vagina.[8] Premature infants are at greater risk for cerebral palsy, delays in development, hearing problems and sight problems.[1] These risks are greater the earlier a baby is born.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cause of preterm birth is often not known.[2] Risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, being pregnant with more than one baby, being either obese or underweight, a number of vaginal infections, tobacco smoking and psychological stress, among others.[2][3] It is recommended that labor not be medically induced before 39 weeks unless required for other medical reasons.[2] The same recommendation applies to cesarean section.[2] Medical reasons for early delivery include preeclampsia.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn those at risk, the hormone progesterone, if taken during pregnancy, may prevent preterm birth.[5] Evidence does not support the usefulness of bed rest.[5][10] It is estimated that at least 75% of preterm infants would survive with appropriate treatment, and the survival rate is highest among the infants born the latest.[2] In women who might deliver between 24 and 37?weeks, corticosteroids improve outcomes.[6][11] A number of medications, including nifedipine, may delay delivery so that a mother can be moved to where more medical care is available and the corticosteroids have a greater chance to work.[12] Once the baby is born, care includes keeping the baby warm through skin to skin contact, supporting breastfeeding, treating infections and supporting breathing.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreterm birth is the most common cause of death among infants worldwide.[1] About 15 million babies are preterm each year (5% to 18% of all deliveries).[2] Approximately 0.5% of births are extremely early periviable births, and these account for most of the deaths.[13] In many countries, rates of premature births have increased between the 1990s and 2010s.[2] Complications from preterm births resulted in 0.81 million deaths in 2015 down from 1.57 million in 1990.[7][14] The chance of survival at 22 weeks is about 6%, while at 23 weeks it is 26%, 24 weeks 55% and 25 weeks about 72%.[15] The chances of survival without any long-term difficulties are lower.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn humans, the usual definition of preterm birth is birth before a gestational age of 37 complete weeks.[17] In the normal human fetus, several organ systems mature between 34 and 37 weeks, and the fetus reaches adequate maturity by the end of this period. One of the main organs greatly affected by premature birth is the lungs. The lungs are one of the last organs to mature in the womb; because of this, many premature babies spend the first days and weeks of their lives on ventilators. Therefore, a significant overlap exists between preterm birth and prematurity. Generally, preterm babies are premature and term babies are mature. Preterm babies born near 37 weeks often have no problems relating to prematurity if their lungs have developed adequate surfactant, which allows the lungs to remain expanded between breaths. Sequelae of prematurity can be reduced to a small extent by using drugs to accelerate maturation of the fetus, and to a greater extent by preventing preterm birth.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreterm birth causes a range of problems.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main categories of causes of preterm birth are preterm labor induction and spontaneous preterm labor. Signs and symptoms of preterm labor include four or more uterine contractions in one hour. In contrast to false labour, true labor is accompanied by cervical dilatation and effacement. Also, vaginal bleeding in the third trimester, heavy pressure in the pelvis, or abdominal or back pain could be indicators that a preterm birth is about to occur. A watery discharge from the vagina may indicate premature rupture of the membranes that surround the baby. While the rupture of the membranes may not be followed by labor, usually delivery is indicated as infection (chorioamnionitis) is a serious threat to both fetus and mother. In some cases, the cervix dilates prematurely without pain or perceived contractions, so that the mother may not have warning signs until very late in the birthing process.\\r\\n\\r\\nA review into using uterine monitoring at home to detect contractions and possible preterm births in women at higher risk of having a preterm baby found that it did not reduce the number of preterm births.[19] The research included in the review was poor quality but it showed that home monitoring may increase the number of unplanned antenatal visits and may reduce the number of babies admitted to special care when compared with women receiving normal antenatal care.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the U.S. where many neonatal infections and other causes of neonatal death have been markedly reduced, prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal mortality at 25%.[20] Prematurely born infants are also at greater risk for having subsequent serious chronic health problems as discussed below.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest gestational age at which the infant has at least a 50% chance of survival is referred to as the limit of viability. As NICU care has improved over the last 40 years, the limit of viability has reduced to approximately 24 weeks.[21][22] Most newborns who die, and 40% of older infants who die, were born between 20 and 25.9 weeks (gestational age), during the second trimester.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs risk of brain damage and developmental delay is significant at that threshold even if the infant survives, there are ethical controversies over the aggressiveness of the care rendered to such infants. The limit of viability has also become a factor in the abortion debate.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreterm infants usually show physical signs of prematurity in reverse proportion to the gestational age. As a result, they are at risk for numerous medical problems affecting different organ systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nA study of 241 children born between 22 and 25 weeks who were currently of school age found that 46 percent had severe or moderate disabilities such as cerebral palsy, vision or hearing loss and learning problems. Thirty-four percent were mildly disabled and 20 percent had no disabilities, while 12 percent had disabling cerebral palsy.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact cause of preterm birth is difficult to determine and it may be multi-factorial. The cause of 50% of preterm births is never determined.[29] Labor is a complex process involving many factors. Four different pathways have been identified that can result in preterm birth and have considerable evidence: precocious fetal endocrine activation, uterine overdistension (placental abruption), decidual bleeding, and intrauterine inflammation/infection.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIdentifying women at high risk of giving birth early would enable the health services to provide specialized care for these women to delay the birth or make sure they are in the best place to give birth (for example a hospital with a special care baby unit). Risk scoring systems have been suggested as a possible way of identifying these women. However, there is no research in this area so it is unclear whether the risk scoring systems would prolong pregnancy and reduce the numbers of preterm births or not.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of factors have been identified that are linked to a higher risk of a preterm birth such as being less than 18 years of age.[36] Maternal height and weight can play a role.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther, in the U.S. and the UK, black women have preterm birth rates of 15ÿ18%, more than double than that of the white population. Filipinos are also at high risk of premature birth, and it is believed that nearly 11ÿ15% of Filipinos born in the U.S. (compared to other Asians at 7.6% and whites at 7.8%) are premature.[38] Filipinos being a big risk factor is evidenced with the Philippines being the 8th highest ranking in the world for preterm births, the only non-African country in the top 10.[39] This discrepancy is not seen in comparison to other Asian groups or Hispanic immigrants and remains unexplained.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nPregnancy interval makes a difference as women with a six-month span or less between pregnancies have a two-fold increase in preterm birth.[40] Studies on type of work and physical activity have given conflicting results, but it is opined that stressful conditions, hard labor, and long hours are probably linked to preterm birth.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nA history of spontaneous (i.e., miscarriage) or surgical abortion has been associated with a small increase in the risk of preterm birth, with an increased risk with increased number of abortions, although it is unclear whether the increase is caused by the abortion or by confounding risk factors (e.g., socioeconomic status).[41] Increased risk has not been shown in women who terminated their pregnancies medically.[42] Pregnancies that are unwanted or unintended are also a risk factor for preterm birth.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdequate maternal nutrition is important. Women with a low BMI are at increased risk for preterm birth.[44] Further, women with poor nutrition status may also be deficient in vitamins and minerals. Adequate nutrition is critical for fetal development and a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may help reduce the risk of a preterm delivery.[45] Obesity does not directly lead to preterm birth;[46] however, it is associated with diabetes and hypertension which are risk factors by themselves.[36] To some degree those individuals may have underlying conditions (i.e., uterine malformation, hypertension, diabetes) that persist.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen with celiac disease have an increased risk of the development of preterm birth.[35] The risk of preterm birth is more elevated when celiac disease remains undiagnosed and untreated.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarital status is associated with risk for preterm birth. A study of 25,373 pregnancies in Finland revealed that unmarried mothers had more preterm deliveries than married mothers (P=0.001).[34] Pregnancy outside of marriage was associated overall with a 20% increase in total adverse outcomes, even at a time when Finland provided free maternity care. A study in Quebec of 720,586 births from 1990 to 1997 revealed less risk of preterm birth for infants with legally married mothers compared with those with common-law wed or unwed parents.[47][needs update]\\r\\n\\r\\nGenetic make-up is a factor in the causality of preterm birth. Genetics has been a big factor into why Filipinos have a high risk of premature birth as the Filipinos have a large prevalence of mutations that help them be predisposed to premature births.[38] An intra- and transgenerational increase in the risk of preterm delivery has been demonstrated.[48] No single gene has been identified.\\r\\n\\r\\nSubfertility is associated with preterm birth. Couples who have tried more than 1 year versus those who have tried less than 1 year before achieving a spontaneous conception have an adjusted odds ratio of 1.35 (95% confidence interval 1.22-1.50) of preterm birth.[49] Pregnancies after IVF confers a greater risk of preterm birth than spontaneous conceptions after more than 1 year of trying, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.55 (95% CI 1.30-1.85).[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of fertility medication that stimulates the ovary to release multiple eggs and of IVF with embryo transfer of multiple embryos has been implicated as an important factor in preterm birth. Maternal medical conditions increase the risk of preterm birth. Often labor has to be induced for medical reasons; such conditions include high blood pressure,[50] pre-eclampsia,[51] maternal diabetes,[52] asthma, thyroid disease, and heart disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a number of women anatomical issues prevent the baby from being carried to term. Some women have a weak or short cervix[50] (the strongest predictor of premature birth)[53][54][55] Women with vaginal bleeding during pregnancy are at higher risk for preterm birth. While bleeding in the third trimester may be a sign of placenta previa or placental abruption ÿ conditions that occur frequently preterm ÿ even earlier bleeding that is not caused by these conditions is linked to a higher preterm birth rate.[56] Women with abnormal amounts of amniotic fluid, whether too much (polyhydramnios) or too little (oligohydramnios), are also at risk.[36]\\r\\nThe mental status of the women is of significance. Anxiety[57] and depression have been linked to preterm birth.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the use of tobacco, cocaine, and excessive alcohol during pregnancy increases the chance of preterm delivery. Tobacco is the most commonly abused drug during pregnancy and contributes significantly to low birth weight delivery.[58] Babies with birth defects are at higher risk of being born preterm.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nPassive smoking and/or smoking before the pregnancy influences the probability of a preterm birth. The World Health Organization published an international study in March 2014.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresence of anti-thyroid antibodies is associated with an increased risk preterm birth with an odds ratio of 1.9 and 95% confidence interval of 1.1ÿ3.5.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2004 systematic review of 30 studies on the association between intimate partner violence and birth outcomes concluded that preterm birth and other adverse outcomes, including death, are higher among abused pregnant women than among non-abused women.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nigerian cultural method of abdominal massage has been shown to result in 19% preterm birth among women in Nigeria, plus many other adverse outcomes for the mother and baby.[63] This ought not be confused with massage conducted by a fully trained and licensed massage therapist or by significant others trained to provide massage during pregnancy, which has been shown to have numerous positive results during pregnancy, including the reduction of preterm birth, less depression, lower cortisol, and reduced anxiety.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe frequency of infection in preterm birth is inversely related to the gestational age. Mycoplasma genitalium infection is associated with increased risk of preterm birth, and spontaneous abortion.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nInfectious microorganisms can be ascending, hematogeneous, iatrogenic by a procedure, or retrograde through the Fallopian tubes. From the deciduas they may reach the space between the amnion and chorion, the amniotic fluid, and the fetus. A chorioamnionitis also may lead to sepsis of the mother. Fetal infection is linked to preterm birth and to significant long-term handicap including cerebral palsy.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been reported that asymptomatic colonization of the decidua occurs in up to 70% of women at term using a DNA probe suggesting that the presence of micro-organism alone may be insufficient to initiate the infectious response.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the condition is more prevalent in black women in the US and the UK, it has been suggested to be an explanation for the higher rate of preterm birth in these populations. It is opined that bacterial vaginosis before or during pregnancy may affect the decidual inflammatory response that leads to preterm birth. The condition known as aerobic vaginitis can be a serious risk factor for preterm labor; several previous studies failed to acknowledge the difference between aerobic vaginitis and bacterial vaginosis, which may explain some of the contradiction in the results.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntreated yeast infections are associated with preterm birth.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nA review into prophylactic antibiotics (given to prevent infection) in the second and third trimester of pregnancy (13ÿ42 weeks of pregnancy) found a reduction in the number of preterm births in women with bacterial vaginosis. These antibiotics also reduced the number of waters breaking before labor in full-term pregnancies, reduced the risk of infection of the lining of the womb after delivery (endometritis), and rates of gonococcal infection. However, the women without bacterial vaginosis did not have any reduction in preterm births or pre-labor preterm waters breaking. Much of the research included in this review lost participants during follow-up so did not report the long-term effects of the antibiotics on mothers or babies. More research in this area is needed to find the full effects of giving antibiotics throughout the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of maternal bacterial infections are associated with preterm birth including pyelonephritis, asymptomatic bacteriuria, pneumonia, and appendicitis. A review into giving antibiotics in pregnancy for asymptomatic bacteriuria (urine infection with no symptoms) found the research was of very low quality but that it did suggest that taking antibiotics reduced the numbers of preterm births and babies with low birth weight.[70] Another review found that one dose of antibiotics did not seem as effective as a course of antibiotics but fewer women reported side effects from one dose.[71] This review recommended that more research is needed to discover the best way of treating asymptomatic bacteriuria.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nA different review found that preterm births happened less for pregnant women who had routine testing for low genital tract infections than for women who only had testing when they showed symptoms of low genital tract infections.[72] The women being routinely tested also gave birth to fewer babies with a low birth weight. Even though these results look promising, the review was only based on one study so more research is needed into routine screening for low genital tract infections.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso periodontal disease has been shown repeatedly to be linked to preterm birth.[73][74] In contrast, viral infections, unless accompanied by a significant febrile response, are considered not to be a major factor in relation to preterm birth.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is believed to be a maternal genetic component in preterm birth.[75] Estimated heritability of timing-of-birth in women was 34%. However, the occurrence of preterm birth in families does not follow a clear inheritance pattern, thus supporting the idea that preterm birth is a non-Mendelian trait with a polygenic nature.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlacental alpha microglobulin-1 (PAMG-1) has been the subject of several investigations evaluating its ability to predict imminent spontaneous preterm birth in women with signs, symptoms, or complaints suggestive of preterm labor.[77][78][79][80][81][82][83] In one investigation comparing this test to fetal fibronectin testing and cervical length measurement via transvaginal ultrasound, the test for PAMG-1 (commercially known as the PartoSure test) has been reported to be the single best predictor of imminent spontaneous delivery within 7 days of a patient presenting with signs, symptoms, or complaints of preterm labor. Specifically, the PPV, or positive predictive value, of the tests were 76%, 29%, and 30% for PAMG-1, fFN and CL, respectively (P < 0.01).[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nFetal fibronectin (fFN) has become an important biomarkerthe presence of this glycoprotein in the cervical or vaginal secretions indicates that the border between the chorion and deciduas has been disrupted. A positive test indicates an increased risk of preterm birth, and a negative test has a high predictive value.[36] It has been shown that only 1% of women in questionable cases of preterm labor delivered within the next week when the test was negative.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nObstetric ultrasound has become useful in the assessment of the cervix in women at risk for premature delivery. A short cervix preterm is undesirable: A cervical length of less than 25?mm at or before 24 weeks of gestational age is the most common definition of cervical incompetence.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically efforts have been primarily aimed to improve survival and health of preterm infants (tertiary intervention). Such efforts, however, have not reduced the incidence of preterm birth. Increasingly primary interventions that are directed at all women, and secondary intervention that reduce existing risks are looked upon as measures that need to be developed and implemented to prevent the health problems of premature infants and children.[87] Smoking bans are effective in decreasing preterm births.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdoption of specific professional policies can immediately reduce risk of preterm birth as the experience in assisted reproduction has shown when the number of embryos during embryo transfer was limited.[87]\\r\\nMany countries have established specific programs to protect pregnant women from hazardous or night-shift work and to provide them with time for prenatal visits and paid pregnancy-leave. The EUROPOP study showed that preterm birth is not related to type of employment, but to prolonged work (over 42 hours per week) or prolonged standing (over 6 hours per day).[89] Also, night work has been linked to preterm birth.[90] Health policies that take these findings into account can be expected to reduce the rate of preterm birth.[87]\\r\\nPreconceptional intake of folic acid is recommended to reduce birth defects. There is significant evidence that long-term (> one year) use of folic acid supplement preconceptionally may reduce premature birth.[91][92][93] Reducing smoking is expected to benefit pregnant women and their offspring.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nHealthy eating can be instituted at any stage of the pregnancy including nutritional adjustments, use of vitamin supplements, and smoking cessation.[87] Calcium supplementation in women who have low dietary calcium reduces the number of negative outcomes including preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, and maternal death.[94] The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests 1.5ÿ2 g of calcium supplements daily, for pregnant women who have low levels calcium in their diet.[94] Supplemental intake of C and E vitamins have not been found to reduce preterm birth rates.[95] Different strategies are used in the administration of prenatal care, and future studies need to determine if the focus can be on screening for high-risk women, or widened support for low-risk women, or to what degree these approaches can be merged.[87] While periodontal infection has been linked with preterm birth, randomized trials have not shown that periodontal care during pregnancy reduces preterm birth rates.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nScreening for asymptomatic bacteriuria followed by appropriate treatment reduces pyelonephritis and reduces the risk of preterm birth.[96] Extensive studies have been carried out to determine if other forms of screening in low-risk women followed by appropriate intervention are beneficial, including: Screening for and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum, group B streptococcus, Trichomonas vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis did not reduce the rate of preterm birth.[87] Routine ultrasound examination of the length of the cervix identifies patients at risk, but cerclage is not proven useful, and the application of a progestogen is under study.[87] Screening for the presence of fibronectin in vaginal secretions is not recommended at this time in women at low risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-care methods to reduce the risk of preterm birth include proper nutrition, avoiding stress, seeking appropriate medical care, avoiding infections, and the control of preterm birth risk factors (e.g. working long hours while standing on feet, carbon monoxide exposure, domestic abuse, and other factors). Self-monitoring vaginal pH followed by yogurt treatment or clindamycin treatment if the pH was too high all seem to be effective at reducing the risk of preterm birth.[97][98] Additional support during pregnancy does not appear to prevent low birthweight or preterm birth.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen are identified to be at increased risk for preterm birth on the basis of their past obstetrical history or the presence of known risk factors. Preconception intervention can be helpful in selected patients in a number of ways. Patients with certain uterine anomalies may have a surgical correction (i.e. removal of a uterine septum), and those with certain medical problems can be helped by optimizing medical therapies prior to conception, be it for asthma, diabetes, hypertension and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn multiple pregnancies, which often result from use of assisted reproductive technology, there is a high risk of preterm birth. Selective reduction is used to reduce the number of fetuses to two or three.[100][101][102]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of agents have been studied for the secondary prevention of indicated preterm birth. Trials using low-dose aspirin, fish oil, vitamin C and E, and calcium to reduce preeclampsia demonstrated some reduction in preterm birth only when low-dose aspirin was used.[87] Even if agents such as calcium or antioxidants were able to reduce preeclampsia, a resulting decrease in preterm birth was not observed.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nReduction in activity by the motherpelvic rest, limited work, bed restmay be recommended although there is no evidence it is useful with some concerns it is harmful.[103] Increasing medical care by more frequent visits and more education has not been shown to reduce preterm birth rates.[99] Use of nutritional supplements such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is based on the observation that populations who have a high intake of such agents are at low risk for preterm birth, presumably as these agents inhibit production of proinflammatory cytokines. A randomized trial showed a significant decline in preterm birth rates,[104] and further studies are in the making.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile antibiotics can get rid of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy, this does not appear to change the risk of preterm birth.[105] It has been suggested that chronic chorioamnionitis is not sufficiently treated by antibiotics alone (and therefore they cannot ameliorate the need for preterm delivery in this condition).[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nProgestogens, often given in the form of progesterone or hydroxyprogesterone caproate, relaxes the uterine musculature, maintains cervical length, and has anti-inflammatory properties, and thus exerts activities expected to be beneficial in reducing preterm birth. Two meta-analyses demonstrated a reduction in the risk of preterm birth in women with recurrent preterm birth by 40ÿ55%.[106][107]\\r\\n\\r\\nProgestogen supplementation also reduces the frequency of preterm birth in pregnancies where there is a short cervix.[108] However, progestogens are not effective in all populations, as a study involving twin gestations failed to see any benefit.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn preparation for childbirth, the woman's cervix shortens. Preterm cervical shortening is linked to preterm birth and can be detected by ultrasonography. Cervical cerclage is a surgical intervention that places a suture around the cervix to prevent its shortening and widening. Numerous studies have been performed to assess the value of cervical cerclage and the procedure appears helpful primarily for women with a short cervix and a history of preterm birth.[108][110] Instead of a prophylactic cerclage, women at risk can be monitored during pregnancy by sonography, and when shortening of the cervix is observed, the cerclage can be performed.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 75% of nearly a million deaths due to preterm deliver would survive if provided warmth, breastfeeding, treatments for infection, and breathing support.[111] If a baby has cardiac arrest at birth and is before 23 weeks or less than 400?g attempts at resuscitation are not indicated.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nTertiary interventions are aimed at women who are about to go into preterm labor, or rupture the membranes or bleed preterm. The use of the fibronectin test and ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy and reduces false-positive diagnosis. While treatments to arrest early labor where there is progressive cervical dilatation and effacement will not be effective to gain sufficient time to allow the fetus to grow and mature further, it may defer delivery sufficiently to allow the mother to be brought to a specialized center that is equipped and staffed to handle preterm deliveries.[113] In a hospital setting women are hydrated via intravenous infusion (as dehydration can lead to premature uterine contractions).[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeverely premature infants may have underdeveloped lungs because they are not yet producing their own surfactant. This can lead directly to respiratory distress syndrome, also called hyaline membrane disease, in the neonate. To try to reduce the risk of this outcome, pregnant mothers with threatened premature delivery prior to 34 weeks are often administered at least one course of glucocorticoids, a steroid that crosses the placental barrier and stimulates the production of surfactant in the lungs of the baby.[11] Steroid use up to 37 weeks is also recommended by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.[11] Typical glucocorticoids that would be administered in this context are betamethasone or dexamethasone, often when the pregnancy has reached viability at 23 weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn cases where premature birth is imminent, a second \\"rescue\\" course of steroids may be administered 12 to 24 hours before the anticipated birth. There are still some concerns about the efficacy and side effects of a second course of steroids, but the consequences of RDS are so severe that a second course is often viewed as worth the risk. A 2015 Cochrane review supports the use of repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids for women still at risk of preterm birth seven days or more after an initial course.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeside reducing respiratory distress, other neonatal complications are reduced by the use of glucocorticosteroids, namely intraventricular bleeding, necrotising enterocolitis, and patent ductus arteriosus.[116] A single course of antenatal corticosteroids could be considered routine for preterm delivery, but there are some concerns about applicability of this recommendation to low-resource settings with high rates of infections.[116] It remains unclear whether one corticosteroid (or one particular regimen) has advantages over another.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerns about adverse effects of prenatal corticosteroids include increased risk for maternal infection, difficulty with diabetic control, and possible long-term effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes for the infants. There is ongoing discussion about when steroids should be given (i.e. only antenatally or postnatally too) and for how long (i.e. single course or repeated administration). Despite these unknowns, there is a consensus that the benefits of a single course of prenatal glucocorticosteroids vastly outweigh the potential risks.[118][119][120]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe routine administration of antibiotics to all women with threatened preterm labor reduces the risk of the baby to get infected with group B streptococcus and has been shown to reduce related mortality rates.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen membranes rupture prematurely, obstetrical management looks for development of labor and signs of infection. Prophylactic antibiotic administration has been shown to prolong pregnancy and reduced neonatal morbidity with rupture of membranes at less than 34 weeks.[122] Because of concern about necrotizing enterocolitis, amoxicillin or erythromycin has been recommended, but not amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav).[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of medications may be useful to delay delivery including: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, calcium channel blockers, beta mimetics, and atosiban.[123] Tocolysis rarely delays delivery beyond 24ÿ48 hours.[124] This delay, however, may be sufficient to allow the pregnant woman to be transferred to a center specialized for management of preterm deliveries and give administered corticosteroids to reduce neonatal organ immaturity. Meta-analyses indicate that calcium-channel blockers and an oxytocin antagonist can delay delivery by 2ÿ7 days, and 2-agonist drugs delay by 48 hours but carry more side effects.[87][125] Magnesium sulfate does not appear to be useful to prevent preterm birth.[126] Its use before delivery, however, does appear to decrease the risk of cerebral palsy.[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe routine use of caesarean section for early delivery of infants expected to have very low birth weight is controversial,[87][128] and a decision concerning the route and time of delivery probably needs to be made on a case by case basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter delivery, plastic wraps or warm mattresses are useful to keep the infant warm on their way to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).[129][needs update] In developed countries premature infants are usually cared for in an NICU. The physicians who specialize in the care of very sick or premature babies are known as neonatologists. In the NICU, premature babies are kept under radiant warmers or in incubators (also called isolettes), which are bassinets enclosed in plastic with climate control equipment designed to keep them warm and limit their exposure to germs. Modern neonatal intensive care involves sophisticated measurement of temperature, respiration, cardiac function, oxygenation, and brain activity. Treatments may include fluids and nutrition through intravenous catheters, oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation support, and medications. In developing countries where advanced equipment and even electricity may not be available or reliable, simple measures such as kangaroo care (skin to skin warming), encouraging breastfeeding, and basic infection control measures can significantly reduce preterm morbidity and mortality. Bili lights may also be used to treat newborn jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia).\\r\\n\\r\\nWater can be carefully provided to prevent dehydration but no so much to increase risks of side effects.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2012 policy statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding \\"significant short- and long-term beneficial effects,\\" including lower rates of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chance of survival at 22 weeks is about 6%, while at 23 weeks it is 26%, 24 weeks 55% and 25 weeks about 72%.[15] The chances of survival without long-term difficulties is less.[16] In the developed world overall survival is about 90% while in low-income countries survival rates are about 10%.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome children will adjust well during childhood and adolescence,[132] although disability is more likely nearer the limits of viability. A large study followed children born between 22 and 25 weeks until the age of 6 years old. Of these children, 46 percent had moderate to severe disabilities such as cerebral palsy, vision or hearing loss and learning disabilities, 34 percent had mild disabilities, and 20 percent had no disabilities. Twelve percent had disabling cerebral palsy.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs survival has improved, the focus of interventions directed at the newborn has shifted to reduce long-term disabilities, particularly those related to brain injury.[132] Some of the complications related to prematurity may not be apparent until years after the birth. A long-term study demonstrated that the risks of medical and social disabilities extend into adulthood and are higher with decreasing gestational age at birth and include cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, disorders of psychological development, behavior, and emotion, disabilities of vision and hearing, and epilepsy.[133] Standard intelligence tests showed that 41 percent of children born between 22 and 25 weeks had moderate or severe learning disabilities when compared to the test scores of a group of similar classmates who were born at full-term.[28] It is also shown that higher levels of education were less likely to be obtained with decreasing gestational age at birth.[133] People born prematurely may be more susceptible to developing depression as teenagers.[134]\\r\\nSome of these problems can be described as being within the executive domain and have been speculated to arise due to decreased myelinization of the frontal lobes.[135] Studies of people born premature and investigated later with MRI brain imaging, demonstrate qualitative anomalies of brain structure and grey matter deficits within temporal lobe structures and the cerebellum that persist into adolescence.[136]  Throughout life they are more likely to require services provided by physical therapists, occupational therapists, or speech therapists.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the neurosensory, mental and educational problems studied in school age and adolescent children born extremely preterm, the majority of preterm survivors born during the early years of neonatal intensive care are found to do well and to live fairly normal lives in young adulthood.[137] Young adults born preterm seem to acknowledge that they have more health problems than their peers, yet feel the same degree of satisfaction with their quality of life.[138]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the neurodevelopmental consequences of prematurity, infants born preterm have a greater risk for many other health problems. For instance, children born prematurely have an increased risk for developing chronic kidney disease.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreterm birth complicates the births of infants worldwide affecting 5% to 18% of births.[68] In Europe and many developed countries the preterm birth rate is generally 5ÿ9%, and in the USA it has even risen to 12ÿ13% in the last decades.[141]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs weight is easier to determine than gestational age, the World Health Organization tracks rates of low birth weight (< 2,500?grams), which occurred in 16.5 percent of births in less developed regions in 2000.[142] It is estimated that one third of these low birth weight deliveries are due to preterm delivery. Weight generally correlates to gestational age, however, infants may be underweight for other reasons than a preterm delivery. Neonates of low birth weight (LBW) have a birth weight of less than 2500 g (5?lb 8 oz) and are mostly but not exclusively preterm babies as they also include small for gestational age (SGA) babies. Weight-based classification further recognizes Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) which is less than 1,500 g, and Extremely Low Birth Weight (ELBW) which is less than 1,000 g.[143] Almost all neonates in these latter two groups are born preterm.\\r\\n\\r\\nComplications from preterm births resulted in 740,000 deaths in 2013, down from 1.57 million in 1990.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreterm birth is a significant cost factor in healthcare, not even considering the expenses of long-term care for individuals with disabilities due to preterm birth. A 2003 study in the US determined neonatal costs to be $224,400 for a newborn at 500ÿ700 g versus $1,000 at over 3,000 g. The costs increase exponentially with decreasing gestational age and weight.[144]\\r\\nThe 2007 Institute of Medicine report Preterm Birth[145] found that the 550,000 premature babies born each year in the U.S. run up about $26 billion in annual costs, mostly related to care in neonatal intensive care units, but the real tab may top $50 billion.[146]\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Elgin Gill (born on 20 May 1987 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) was the earliest premature baby in the world, until that record was broken in 2014. He was 128 days premature (21 weeks and 5 days' gestation) and weighed 1?pound 6?ounces (624?g). He survived.[147][148]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, a baby girl born in San Antonio, Texas, U.S. became the youngest premature baby in the world. The daughter of Courtney Stensrud was born at 21 weeks 4 days and weighed 410 grams (less than a pound). Kaashif Ahmad resuscitated the baby after she was born. As of 2017, the girl was in preschool and on par with her peers.[149]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmillia Taylor is also often cited as the most premature baby.[150] She was born on 24 October 2006 in Miami, Florida, U.S. at 21 weeks and 6 days' gestation.[151] This report has created some confusion as her gestation was measured from the date of conception (through in vitro fertilization) rather than the date of her mother's last menstrual period, making her appear 2 weeks younger than if gestation was calculated by the more common method.[134] At birth, she was 9 inches (22.9?cm) long and weighed 10 ounces (280?g).[150] She suffered digestive and respiratory problems, together with a brain hemorrhage. She was discharged from the Baptist Children's Hospital on 20 February 2007.[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe record for the smallest premature baby to survive was held for a considerable amount of time by Madeline Mann, who was born in 1989 at 26 weeks, weighing 9.9 ounces (280?g) and measuring 9.5 inches (241.3?mm) long.[152] This record was broken in September 2004 by Rumaisa Rahman, who was born in the same hospital[153] at 25 weeks' gestation. At birth, she was 8 inches (200?mm) long and weighed 244 grams (8.6?oz). Her twin sister was also a small baby, weighing 563 grams (1?lb 3.9?oz) at birth. During pregnancy their mother had suffered from pre-eclampsia, which causes dangerously high blood pressure putting the baby into distress and requiring birth by caesarean section. The larger twin left the hospital at the end of December, while the smaller remained there until 10 February 2005 by which time her weight had increased to 1.18?kg (2.6?lb).[154] Generally healthy, the twins had to undergo laser eye surgery to correct vision problems, a common occurrence among premature babies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world's smallest premature boy to survive was born in February 2009 at Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.. Jonathon Whitehill was born at 25 weeks' gestation with a weight of 310 grams (11?oz). He was hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit for five months, and then discharged.[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorical figures who were born prematurely include Johannes Kepler (born in 1571 at seven months' gestation), Isaac Newton (born in 1642, small enough to fit into a quart mug, according to his mother), Winston Churchill (born in 1874 at seven months' gestation), and Anna Pavlova (born in 1885 at seven months' gestation),[156]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe transformation of medical care means that extremely premature and very ill babies have better chances of survival than ever before. But it is difficult to predict which babies will die and which will live, though possibly with severe disabilities. As a consequence, families and health professionals have to make complex decisions about how much intervention is necessary or justifiable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most difficult decisions are about whether or not to resuscitate a premature baby and admit him or her to neonatal intensive care, or whether to withdraw intensive care and give the child palliative care.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is discussed at great length in a report \\"Critical care decisions in fetal and neonatal medicine: ethical issues\\"[157] produced by the London-based Nuffield Council for Bioethics.","input":"When is a baby said to be premature?"},{"output":"as early as 7-months-old","context":"The development of memory in children becomes evident within the first 3 years of a child's life as they show considerable advances in declarative memory. This enhancement continues into adolescence with major developments in short term memory, working memory, long term memory and autobiographical memory.[1]\\r\\nRecent research on the development of memory has indicated that declarative, or explicit memory, may exist in infants who are even younger than two years old. For example, newborns who are less than 3 days old demonstrate a preference for their mothers own voice.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDeclarative memory develops very rapidly throughout the first 2 years of life; infants of this age show evidence of cognitive development in many ways (e.g., increased attention, language acquisition, increasing knowledge). There is a difference in the brain development of explicit and implicit memory in infants. Implicit memory is controlled by an early-developing memory system in the brain that is present very early on, and can be explained by the early maturation of striatum, cerebellum, and brain stem, which are all involved in implicit learning and memory.[3]\\r\\nDevelopment of explicit memory depends on a later developing memory system in the brain that reaches maturity between 8 and 10 months of age. Explicit memory depends heavily on structures in the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus and the parahippocampal cortex. Much of the brain system is formed before birth, however the dentate gyrus within the hippocampal formation has about 70% of the number of cells in adults.[4]\\r\\nRapid myelination of axons within the central nervous system occurs during first year of life which can dramatically increase the efficiency and speed of transmission in neurons. This can explain the higher processing speed of older infants as compared to younger ones.[5]\\r\\nAccording to Baddeley's model of working memory, working memory is composed of three parts. First is the central executive which is responsible for a range of regulatory functions including attention, the control of action, and problem solving. Second, the phonological loop, which is specialized for the manipulation and retention of material in particular informational domains. Finally, the visuospatial sketchpad stores material in terms of its visual or spatial features. The strength of the relationships between the three components of working memory vary; the central executive is strongly linked with both the phonological loop as well as the visuospatial sketchpad which are both independent of each other. Some evidence indicates linear increases in performance of working memory from age 3-4 years through to adolescence.[6][7][8][9][10]\\r\\nIn children from 2-4, the memory storage capacity limitation constrains complex comprehension processes. As the child grows older however, less processing is necessary which opens more storage space for memory.[11][12][13]\\r\\nEvidence indicates linear increases in performance from age 4 years through to adolescence. Prior to about 7 years of age, serial recall performance is mediated by the phonological store which is one component of the phonological loop. Preschool aged children do not use a subvocal rehearsal strategy to maintain decaying phonological representations in the store but instead they identify visual features of pictures in order to remember them. This is evident first by watching children for overt sign of rehearsal (for example lip movement) and second if the child is given nameable pictures, there are no differences in retrieval found for long versus short words. At the age of seven, children begin to use a subvocal rehearsal process to maximize retention in the phonological store. As development continues, nonauditory memory material is recoded into a phonological code suitable for the phonological loop when possible.[11]\\r\\nYounger children (under the age of 5) may be more dependent than older children or adults on using the visuospatial sketchpad to support immediate memory for visual material. Older children adopt a strategy of verbally recoding pictures where possible and also use the phonological loop to mediate performance of the visual memory task. Between the ages of 5 and 11, visual memory span increases substantially and it is at this point when adult levels of performance are reached.[11][10][13]\\r\\nExplicit memory becomes much better over the developmental years. However, there are small effects of age on implicit memory, which could be because implicit memory involves more basic processes than declarative memory which would make it less affected by a child's developing cognitive skills and abilities.[citation needed]\\r\\nInfants who are 5 months or older are able to use emotions to influence their memories. However, at this age, infants will be more likely to remember things that were characterized by positive emotions. The way that researchers study the memory capabilities of infants in this age range is through measuring eye movements between test images presented. After doing this initial round of testing, the researchers would conduct follow-up tests both 5 minutes later and one day later. The follow-up tests shown to the infants included two geometric shapes: one from the original test, and a new shape. The researchers were able to record how long the infants looked at the images in the follow-up tests and measured how long the infants stared at each shape. The infants were more likely to gaze at the geometric shapes from the original tests if they had been paired with positive voices than if they had been paired with neutral or negative voices. This study indicated that infants at this age would be able to better remember shapes and patterns of things if they were associated with positive emotions because positivity would increase the infants' interest and attention.[14]\\r\\nInfants at as early as 7-months-old can conceptually differentiate between categories such as animals and vehicles. Although infants concepts may be crude by adult standards, they still allow infants to make meaningful semantic distinctions. An example is that infants can differentiate between items belonging to a kitchen and those items belonging to a bathroom.[15] At the very least, these categories lay a foundation for early knowledge development, organizing information in storage and influence future encoding. Infants from 16 months old are able to draw on their semantic knowledge in generalization and inference. This knowledge can also be used by older toddlers, 24-month-olds, to facilitate acquisition and retention of new information. Their knowledge of causal ordering of events can be used to help to recall the sequence of events.[citation needed]\\r\\nKnowledge itself will not alter retention performance, rather how well that knowledge is structured will alter performance. Better retention was shown with information that had greater cohesion and more elaborative elements. Familiarity and repetition of an experience can also influence the organization of information in storage for preschoolers and older children.[16] Children who experienced an event twice recalled the event better 3 months later than did children who only experienced it once and showed equally good recall at 3 months compared to recall at 2 weeks after experiences.[citation needed]\\r\\nAge differences in memory are attributed to age-correlated growth in the foundation of knowledge. What children know affects what they encode, how that information is organized in storage, and the manner in which its retrieved. The greater the background knowledge about the to-be-encoded information, the better that the information is remembered.[16] Because older children have more knowledge than younger children, older children perform better than younger children in most memory tasks. When familiarity and meaningfulness of material were equated across age, developmental differences in memory performance was no longer a factor.[citation needed]\\r\\nChildrens use of memory strategies and the development of metamemory skills are also instrumental in age-related changes in memory, particularly later in childhood years.[17] Knowledge influences memory by affecting retrieval, by facilitating spread of activation among related items in memory and by facilitating the use of strategies. Knowledge also provides better elaboration of information which can strengthen its storage in memory.[citation needed]\\r\\nBy school age, the typical child shows skill in recalling details of past experiences and in organizing those details into a narrative form with cohesion. Memories formed at this age and beyond are more likely to stand the test of time over the years and be recalled in adulthood, compared to earlier memories. Young children can sometimes retain information from specific episodes over very long periods of time, but the particular information a child of a particular age is likely to retain over different periods of time is unpredictable. This depends on the nature of the memory event and individual differences in the child such as gender, parental style of communication, and language ability.[16]\\r\\nThe amount of information that is able to be recalled depends on the childs age at the time of the event. Children at the age of 1-2 can recall personal events, though only in fragments when questioned several months later. Two-year-old children form autobiographical memories and remember them over periods of at least several months.[16]\\r\\nDifficulty in assessing memory in young children can be attributed to their level of language skills; this is because memory tests usually occur in the form of a verbal report. It is unclear whether performance on memory assessments is due to poor memory for the event or to the inability to express what they remember in words. However, memory tests assessing performance with a nonverbal photograph recognition test and behavioral re-enactment showed that children had signs of recall from 27 months, as opposed to 33 months using verbal recall testing.[18]\\r\\nInfantile amnesia is the tendency to have few autobiographical memories from below the age of 2-4.This can be attributed to lack of memory rehearsal; young children do not engage in rehearsal of remembered information. There are two theoretical explanations for why this may occur; although they take different approaches, they are not mutually exclusive of each other.[19] The development of a cognitive self is also thought by some to have an effect on encoding and storing early memories.[20][21][22]\\r\\nAutobiographical memories can only begin to form after infants have developed a sense of self to whom events having personal significance can occur.[23] Evidence of a sense of self develops towards the end of the second year of life, in between 21 and 24 months of age. The development of a cognitive self provides a new framework from which memories can be organized. With this cognitive advancement, we see the emergence of autobiographical memory and the end of infantile amnesia.[24]\\r\\nLanguage and culture play central roles in the early development of autobiographical memory. The manner in which parents discuss the past with their children and how elaborative they are in reminiscing affects how the child encodes the memory. Children whose parents talk in detail about the past are being provided with good opportunities to rehearse their memories. The parents use of language at the time in which the event occurred can also play a factor in how the child remembers the episode. Cultural differences in parenting styles and parent-child relationships can contribute to autobiographical memory at an early age.[25]\\r\\nMemory strategies are ways in which individuals can organize the information that they are processing in order to enhance recall in the future. Memory strategies that are helpful may include but are not limited to verbal rehearsal or mnemonics. The use of memory strategies varies in both the types of strategies used as well as the effectiveness of the strategies used across different age groups.[26]\\r\\nAs children grow older, they show increasing evidence of metamemory which is the knowledge about their memory and how it works.[1] There is strong evidence that suggests that greater awareness and knowledge about ones memory leads to increased use of memory strategies and greater levels of recall.[27]\\r\\nIn children under 7, the relationship between metamemory, strategy use, and recall is generally very weak or absent. This can be seen when comparing older children (over the age of 7) and preschool children on sorting tasks where children are asked to sort objects into groups that go together (for example animals)and attempt to recall them.[28][29]\\r\\nPreschool children use simple tactics for remembering but do not use mental strategies and do not typically differentiate memory and perception. In order to remember objects, they tend to verbally name or visually inspect items and use memory strategies intermittently or inconsistently even if they are aware of how they can improve recall.[27] Memory Strategies are used more consistently by children if they are reminded and taught to use them each time they are processing something that should be remembered.[30]\\r\\nBy the age of 7, the awareness of the benefits of memory strategies in learning generally arises. The goal is for children to recognize the advantage of using memory strategies such as categorizing rather than simply looking or naming.[31][29]\\r\\nAt this age, children spontaneously use rehearsal to enhance short-term memory performance and retrieval strategies begin to be used spontaneously without the guidance of others.[30]\\r\\nIn late elementary school, children engage in self-directed use of organization and demonstrate the ability to impose a semantic structure on the to-be-remembered items to guide memory performance. For example, if a child is packing their bag for school they can go through each part of their day and think of each item that they need to pack.[30] Children at this age understand the advantages of using memory strategies and make use of strategies like categorization over looking or naming if they are instructed to think about learning strategies prior to learning.[31]\\r\\nIn early adolescence, children begin to use elaborative rehearsal meaning that items are not simply kept in mind but rather are processed more deeply. They also prefer to use memory strategies such as categorization rather than simple rehearsal, looking or naming and use these strategies without needing to think about memory strategies prior to learning.[31]","input":"When does a child develop long term memory?"},{"output":"Romulus","context":"In Roman mythology, Romulus and Remus are twin brothers, whose story tells the events that led to the founding of the city of Rome and the Roman Kingdom by Romulus. The killing of Remus by his brother, and other tales from their story, have inspired artists throughout the ages. Since ancient times, the image of the twins being suckled by a she-wolf has been a symbol of the city of Rome and the Roman people. Although the tale takes place before the founding of Rome around 750 BC, the earliest known written account of the myth is from the late 3rd century BC. Possible historical basis for the story, as well as whether the twins' myth was an original part of Roman myth or a later development, is a subject of ongoing debate. \\r\\n\\r\\nRomulus and Remus were born in Alba Longa, one of the ancient Latin cities near the future site of Rome. Their mother, Rhea Silvia was a vestal virgin and the daughter of the former king, Numitor, who had been displaced by his brother Amulius. In some sources, Rhea Silvia conceived them when their father, the god Mars visited her in a sacred grove dedicated to him.[2] Through their mother, the twins were descended from Greek and Latin nobility.\\r\\nSeeing them as a possible threat to his rule, King Amulius ordered them to be killed and they were abandoned on the bank of the Tiber River to die. They were saved by the god Tiberinus, Father of the River and survived with the care of others, at the site of what would eventually become Rome. In the most well-known episode, the twins were suckled by a she-wolf, in a cave now known as the Lupercal.[3] Eventually, they were adopted by Faustulus, a shepherd. They grew up tending flocks, unaware of their true identities. Over time, their natural-born leadership abilities attracted a company of supporters from the community.\\r\\nWhen they were young adults, they became involved in a dispute between supporters of Numitor and Amulius. As a result, Remus was taken prisoner and brought to Alba Longa. Both his grandfather and the king suspected his true identity. Romulus, meanwhile, had organized an effort to free his brother and set out with help for the city. During this time they learned of their past and joined forces with their grandfather to restore him to the throne. Amulius was killed and Numitor was reinstated as king of Alba. The twins set out to build a city of their own.\\r\\nAfter arriving back in the area of the seven hills, they disagreed about the hill upon which to build. Romulus preferred the Palatine Hill, above the Lupercal; Remus preferred the Aventine Hill. When they could not resolve the dispute, they agreed to seek the gods' approval through a contest of augury. Remus first saw 6 auspicious birds but soon afterward, Romulus saw 12, and claimed to have won divine approval. The new dispute furthered the contention between them. In the aftermath, Remus was killed either by Romulus or by one of his supporters.[4] Romulus then went on to found the city of Rome, its institutions, government, military and religious traditions. He reigned for many years as its first king.\\r\\nThe origins of the different elements in Rome's foundation myth are a subject of ongoing debate. They may have come from the Romans' own indigenous origins, or from Hellenic influences that were included later. Definitively identifying those original elements has so far eluded the classical academic community.[5] Although the tale takes place before the founding of Rome around 750 BC, the earliest known written account of the myth is from the late 3rd century BC.[6] There is an ongoing debate about how and when the \\"complete\\" fable came together.[7]\\r\\nSome elements are attested to earlier than others, and the storyline and the tone were variously influenced by the circumstances and tastes of the different sources as well as by contemporary Roman politics and concepts of propriety.[8] Whether the twins' myth was an original part of Roman myth or a later development is the subject of an ongoing debate.[7] Sources often contradict one another. They include the histories of Livy, Plutarch, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and Tacitus as well as the work of Virgil and Ovid.[6][9][10] Quintus Fabius Pictor's work became authoritative to the early books of Livy's Ab Urbe Condita, Dionysius of Halicarnassus's Roman Antiquities, and Plutarch's Life of Romulus.[11]\\r\\nThese three works have been among the most widely read versions of the myth. In all three works, the tales of the lupercal and the fratricide are overshadowed by that of the twins' lineage and connections to Aeneas and the deposing of Amulius. The latter receives the most attention in the accounts. Plutarch dedicates nearly half of his account to the overthrow of their uncle.\\r\\nDionysius cites, among others, the histories of Pictor, Lucius Calpurnius Piso, Cato the Elder, Lucius Cincius Alimentus.\\r\\nThe first book of Dionysius' twenty-volume history of Rome does not mention Remus until page 235 (chapter 71). After spending another 8 chapters discussing the background of their birth in Alba, he dedicates a total of 9 chapters to the tale (79ÿ87). Most of that is spent discussing the conflict with Amulius.\\r\\nHe goes on to discuss the various accounts of the city's founding by others, and the lineage and parentage of the twins for another 8 chapters until arriving at the tale of their abandonment by the Tiber. He spends the better part of the chapter 79 discussing the survival in the wild. then the end of 79 through 84 on the account of their struggle with Amulius. 84 with the non-fantastical account of their survival 294. Finally 295 is the augury 85ÿ86, 87ÿ88 the fratricide.303\\r\\nLivy discusses the myth in chapters 4, 5, and 6 of his work's first book. p.?7 parentage 4 p.?8 survival. p.?8 the youth. 5 9ÿ10 the struggle with Amulius. 6 p.?11 (the beginning only) the augury and fratricide.\\r\\nPlutarch relates the legend in chapters 2ÿ10 of the Life of Romulus. He dedicates the most attention, nearly half the entire account, to conflict with Amulius.\\r\\nFasti, the epic Latin poem by Ovid from the early 1st century contains a complete account of the twins' tale. Notably, it relates a tale wherein the ghost of Remus appears to Faustulus and his wife, whom the poet calls \\"Acca\\". In the story, Remus appears to them while in bed and expresses his anger at Celer for killing him and his own, as well as Romulus' unquestioned fraternal love.\\r\\nRoman History by Cassius Dio survives in fragment from various commentaries. They contain a more-or-less complete account. In them, he mentions an oracle that had predicted Amulius' death by a son of Numitor as the reason the Alban king expelled the boys. There is also a mention of \\"another Romulus and Remus\\" and another Rome having been founded long before on the same site.[12]\\r\\nThis work contains a variety of versions of the story. In one, there is a reference to a woodpecker bringing the boys food during the time they were abandoned in the wild. In one account of the conflict with Amulius, the capture of Remus is not mentioned. Instead, Romulus, upon being told of his true identity and the crimes suffered by him and his family at the hands of the Alban king, simply decided to avenge them. He took his supporters directly to the city and killed Amulius, afterwards restoring his grandfather to the throne.[13]\\r\\nModern scholarship approaches the various known stories of Romulus and Remus as cumulative elaborations and later interpretations of Roman foundation-myth. Particular versions and collations were presented by Roman historians as authoritative, an official history trimmed of contradictions and untidy variants to justify contemporary developments, genealogies and actions in relation to Roman morality. Other narratives appear to represent popular or folkloric tradition; some of these remain inscrutable in purpose and meaning. Wiseman sums the whole as the mythography of an unusually problematic foundation and early history.[15][16]\\r\\nThe three canonical accounts of Livy, Dionysius, and Plutarch provide the broad literary basis for studies of Rome's founding mythography. They have much in common, but each is selective to its purpose. Livy's is a dignified handbook, justifying the purpose and morality of Roman traditions of his own day. Dionysius and Plutarch approach the same subjects as interested outsiders, and include founder-traditions not mentioned by Livy, untraceable to a common source and probably specific to particular regions, social classes or oral traditions.[17][18] A Roman text of the late Imperial era, Origo gentis Romanae (The origin of the Roman people) is dedicated to the many \\"more or less bizarre\\", often contradictory variants of Rome's foundation myth, including versions in which Remus founds a city named Remuria, five miles from Rome, and outlives his brother Romulus.[19][20]\\r\\nRoman historians and Roman traditions traced most Roman institutions to Romulus. He was credited with founding Rome's armies, its system of rights and laws, its state religion and government, and the system of patronage that underpinned all social, political and military activity.[21] In reality, such developments would have been spread over a considerable span of time. Some were much older and others much more recent. To most Romans, the evidence for the veracity of the legend and its central characters seemed clear and concrete, an essential part of Rome's sacred topography. One could visit the Lupercal, where the twins were suckled by the she-wolf, or offer worship to the deified Romulus-Quirinus at the \\"shepherd's hut\\", or see it acted out on stage, or simply read the Fasti.\\r\\nThe legend as a whole encapsulates Rome's ideas of itself, its origins and moral values. For modern scholarship, it remains one of the most complex and problematic of all foundation myths, particularly in the manner of Remus's death. Ancient historians had no doubt that Romulus gave his name to the city. Most modern historians believe his name a back-formation from the name Rome; the basis for Remus's name and role remain subjects of ancient and modern speculation. The myth was fully developed into something like an \\"official\\", chronological version in the Late Republican and early Imperial era; Roman historians dated the city's foundation to between 758 and 728 BC, and Plutarch reckoned the twins' birth year as 771 BC. A tradition that gave Romulus a distant ancestor in the semi-divine Trojan prince Aeneas was further embellished, and Romulus was made the direct ancestor of Rome's first Imperial dynasty. Possible historical bases for the broad mythological narrative remain unclear and disputed.[22] The image of the she-wolf suckling the divinely fathered twins became an iconic representation of the city and its founding legend, making Romulus and Remus preeminent among the feral children of ancient mythography.\\r\\nAlthough a debate continues, current scholarship offers little evidence supporting the Roman foundation myth, including a historical Romulus or Remus.[23] Starting with Pictor, the written accounts must have reflected the commonly-held history of the city to some degree, as were not free to make things up.[24] Historical bases for the broad mythological narrative remain unclear and disputed. The archaeologist Andrea Carandini is one of the very few modern scholars who accept Romulus and Remus as historical figures, based on the 1988 discovery of an ancient wall on the north slope of the Palatine Hill in Rome. Carandini dates the structure to the mid-8th century BC and names it the Murus Romuli.[25] In 2007, archaeologists reported the discovery of the Lupercal beneath the home of Emperor Augustus, but a debate over the discovery continues.[26][27]\\r\\nAncient pictures of the Roman twins usually follow certain symbolic traditions, depending on the legend they follow: they either show a shepherd, the she-wolf, the twins under a fig tree, and one or two birds (Livy, Plutarch); or they depict two shepherds, the she-wolf, the twins in a cave, seldom a fig tree, and never any birds (Dionysius of Halicarnassus).\\r\\nThe twins and the she-wolf were featured on what might be the earliest silver coins ever minted in Rome.[28]\\r\\nThe Franks Casket, an Anglo-Saxon ivory box (early 7th century AD) shows Romulus and Remus in an unusual setting, two wolves instead of one, a grove instead of one tree or a cave, four kneeling warriors instead of one or two gesticulating shepherds. According to one interpretation, and as the runic inscription (\\"far from home\\") indicates, the twins are cited here as the Dioscuri, helpers at voyages such as Castor and Polydeuces. Their descent from the Roman god of war predestines them as helpers on the way to war. The carver transferred them into the Germanic holy grove and has Woden's second wolf join them. Thus the picture served  along with five other ones  to influence \\"wyrd\\", the fortune and fate of a warrior king.[29]\\r\\nThe myth has been an inspiration to artists throughout the ages. Particular focus has been paid to the rape of Ilia by Mars and the suckling of the twins by the she-wolf.\\r\\nIn the late 16th century, the wealthy Magnani family from Bologna commissioned a series of artworks based on the Roman foundation myth. The artists contributing works included a sculpture of Hercules with the infant twins by Gabriele Fiorini, featuring the patron's own face. The most important works were an elaborate series of frescoes collectively known as Histories of the Foundation of Rome by the Brothers Carracci: Ludovico, Annibale, and Agostino Carracci.\\r\\nHercules Priapus, Gabriele Fiorini\\r\\nSalone Carracci Palazzo Magnani\\r\\nShe-Wolf Suckling Romulus and Remus (Ludavico)\\r\\nRemus and the Cattle Thieves (attributed to one or more of the Carraccis)\\r\\nRemus being brought before King Amulius (attributed to one or more of the Carraccis)\\r\\nThe death of Amulius\\r\\nThe Loggia di Romolo e Remo is an unfinished, 15th century fresco by Gentile da Fabriano depicting episodes from the legend in the Palazzo Trinci.\\r\\nThe rape of the vestal Rhea Silvia by Mars\\r\\nThe birth of Romulus and Remus\\r\\nLoggia di romolo e remo 08\\r\\nFaustulus finding Romulus and Remus\\r\\nFaustulus bringing the twins to his wife Acca Laurentia\\r\\nThe deposing of Amulius\\r\\nDepiction of the goddess Roma and the Capitoline Wolfe (4th century)\\r\\nDetail of a mosaic with Romolus and Remus, (c.510), Photograph by Ma'arrat al-Numan (2010)\\r\\nMosaic depicting the She-wolf with Romulus and Remus, from Aldborough, (c.300 AD), Leeds City Museum (16025914306)\\r\\nWoodcut illustration of Rhea Silvia and the birth of Romulus and Remus attributed to Johann Zainer (15th century)\\r\\nIlluminated manuscript of Livy's Ab Urbe Condita Libri, (c.1370)\\r\\n14th century depiction of Romulus and Remus\\r\\nDetail from the facade of the Certosa di Pavia, Giovanni Antonio Amadeo (c.1485), photograph by Carlo Brogi (1850ÿ1925)\\r\\nRomolo e Remo, unknown (c.1520)\\r\\nFaustulus (to the right of picture) discovers Romulus and Remus with the she-wolf and woodpecker.

The naturalism of its sculptures and stained glass serve to contrast it with earlier Romanesque architecture.\\r\\nAs the cathedral of the Archdiocese of Paris, Notre-Dame contains the cathedra of the Archbishop of Paris, currently Michel Aupetit. The cathedral treasury contains a reliquary, which houses some of Catholicism's most important relics, including the purported Crown of Thorns, a fragment of the True Cross, and one of the Holy Nails.\\r\\nIn the 1790s, Notre-Dame suffered desecration in the radical phase of the French Revolution when much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed. An extensive restoration supervised by Eugne Viollet-le-Duc began in 1845. A project of further restoration and maintenance began in 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNotre-Dame de Paris was among the first buildings in the world to use the flying buttress. The building was not originally designed to include the flying buttresses around the choir and nave but after the construction began, the thinner walls grew ever higher and stress fractures began to occur as the walls pushed outward. In response, the cathedral's architects built supports around the outside walls, and later additions continued the pattern. The total surface area is 5,500 m2 (interior surface 4,800 m2).\\r\\nMany small individually crafted statues were placed around the outside to serve as column supports and water spouts. Among these are the famous gargoyles, designed for water run-off, and chimeras. The statues were originally colored as was most of the exterior. The paint has worn off. The cathedral was essentially complete by 1345. The cathedral has a narrow climb of 387 steps at the top of several spiral staircases; along the climb it is possible to view its most famous bell and its gargoyles in close quarters, as well as having a spectacular view across Paris when reaching the top.\\r\\nJohn of Jandun recognized the cathedral as one of Paris's three most important buildings [prominent structures] in his 1323 Treatise on the Praises of Paris:\\r\\nIn 1160, because the church in Paris had become the \\"Parish church of the kings of Europe\\", Bishop Maurice de Sully deemed the previous Paris cathedral, Saint-tienne (St Stephen's), which had been founded in the 4th century, unworthy of its lofty role, and had it demolished shortly after he assumed the title of Bishop of Paris. As with most foundation myths, this account needs to be taken with a grain of salt; archeological excavations in the 20th century suggested that the Merovingian cathedral replaced by Sully was itself a massive structure, with a five-aisled nave and a fa?ade some 36m across. It is possible therefore that the faults with the previous structure were exaggerated by the Bishop to help justify the rebuilding in a newer style. According to legend, Sully had a vision of a glorious new cathedral for Paris, and sketched it on the ground outside the original church.\\r\\nTo begin the construction, the bishop had several houses demolished and had a new road built to transport materials for the rest of the cathedral. Construction began in 1163 during the reign of Louis VII, and opinion differs as to whether Sully or Pope Alexander III laid the foundation stone of the cathedral. However, both were at the ceremony. Bishop de Sully went on to devote most of his life and wealth to the cathedral's construction. Construction of the choir took from 1163 until around 1177 and the new High Altar was consecrated in 1182 (it was normal practice for the eastern end of a new church to be completed first, so that a temporary wall could be erected at the west of the choir, allowing the chapter to use it without interruption while the rest of the building slowly took shape). After Bishop Maurice de Sully's death in 1196, his successor, Eudes de Sully (no relation) oversaw the completion of the transepts and pressed ahead with the nave, which was nearing completion at the time of his own death in 1208. By this stage, the western facade had also been laid out, though it was not completed until around the mid-1240s.[5]\\r\\nNumerous architects worked on the site over the period of construction, which is evident from the differing styles at different heights of the west front and towers.[citation needed] Between 1210 and 1220, the fourth architect oversaw the construction of the level with the rose window and the great halls beneath the towers.\\r\\nThe most significant change in design came in the mid 13th century, when the transepts were remodeled in the latest Rayonnant style; in the late 1240s Jean de Chelles added a gabled portal to the north transept topped off by a spectacular rose window. Shortly afterwards (from 1258) Pierre de Montreuil executed a similar scheme on the southern transept. Both these transept portals were richly embellished with sculpture; the south portal features scenes from the lives of St Stephen and of various local saints, while the north portal featured the infancy of Christ and the story of Theophilus in the tympanum, with a highly influential statue of the Virgin and Child in the trumeau.[6]\\r\\nThe Archaeological Crypt of the Paris Notre-Dame (La crypte archologique du Parvis de Notre-Dame) was created in 1965 to protect a range of historical ruins, discovered during construction work and spanning from the earliest settlement in Paris to the modern day. The crypts are managed by the Muse Carnavalet and contain a large exhibit, detailed models of the architecture of different time periods, and how they can be viewed within the ruins. The main feature still visible is the under-floor heating installed during the Roman occupation.[7]\\r\\nIn 1548, rioting Huguenots damaged features of Notre-Dame, considering them idolatrous.[8] During the reigns of Louis XIV and Louis XV, the cathedral underwent major alterations as part of an ongoing attempt to modernize cathedrals throughout Europe. A colossal statue of St Christopher, standing against a pillar near the western entrance and dating from 1413, was destroyed in 1786. Tombs and stained glass windows were destroyed. The north and south rose windows were spared this fate, however.\\r\\nIn 1793, during the French Revolution, the cathedral was rededicated to the Cult of Reason, and then to the Cult of the Supreme Being. During this time, many of the treasures of the cathedral were either destroyed or plundered. The 13th century spire was torn down[9] and the statues located at the west facade were beheaded.[10] Many of the heads were found during a 1977 excavation nearby and are on display at the Muse de Cluny. For a time the Goddess of Liberty replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars.[11] The cathedral's great bells managed to avoid being melted down. The cathedral came to be used as a warehouse for the storage of food.[8]\\r\\nA controversial restoration programme was initiated in 1845, overseen by architects Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Lassus and Eugne Viollet-le-Duc. Viollet Le Duc was responsible for the restorations of several dozen castles, palaces and cathedrals across France. The restoration lasted twenty five years[8] and included a taller and more ornate reconstruction of the flche (a type of spire),[9] as well as the addition of the chimeras on the Galerie des Chimres. Viollet le Duc always signed his work with a bat, the wing structure of which most resembles the Gothic vault (see Chateau de Roquetaillade).\\r\\nThe Second World War caused more damage. Several of the stained glass windows on the lower tier were hit by stray bullets. These were remade after the war, but now sport a modern geometrical pattern, not the old scenes of the Bible.\\r\\nIn 1991, a major programme of maintenance and restoration was initiated, which was intended to last ten years, but was still in progress as of 2010,[8] the cleaning and restoration of old sculptures being an exceedingly delicate matter. Circa 2014, much of the lighting was upgraded to LED lighting.[12]\\r\\nOne of the earliest organs at Notre-Dame, built in 1403 by Friedrich Schambantz, was replaced between 1730-1738 by Francois Thierry. During the restoration of the cathedral by Eugne Viollet-le-Duc, Aristide Cavaill-Coll built a new organ, using pipe work of the former instruments. The organ was dedicated in 1868. In 1904, Charles Mutin modified and added several stops; in 1924, an electric blower was installed. An extensive restoration and cleaning took place in 1932 by Joseph Beuchet. Between 1959 and 1963, the mechanical action with barker machines was replaced by an electric action by Jean Hermann, and a new organ console was installed. During the following years, the stoplist was gradually modified by Robert Boisseau (who added three chamade stops 8', 4', and 2'/16' in 1968) and Jean-Loup Boisseau after 1975, respectively. In fall 1983, the electric combination system was disconnected due to short-circuit risk. Between 1990 and 1992, Jean-Loup Boisseau, Bertrand Cattiaux, Philippe meriau, Michel Giroud, and the Socit Synaptel throughoutly revised and augmented the instrument. A new console was installed, using the stop knobs, pedal and manual keyboards, foot pistons and balance pedals from the Jean Hermann console. Between 2012 and 2014, Bertrand Cattiaux and Pascal Quoirin restored, cleaned, and modified the organ. The stop and key action was upgraded, a new console was built, (again using the stop keys, pedal board, foot pistons and balance pedals of the 1992 console), a new enclosed division (\\"Rsonnance expressive\\", using pipework from the former \\"Petite Pdale\\" by Boisseau, which now can be used as a floating division), the organ case and the facade pipes were restored, and a general tuning was made. The current organ has 115 stops (156 ranks) on five manuals and pedal, and more than 8,000 pipes.\\r\\nViolon Basse 16\\r\\nBourdon 16\\r\\nMontre 8\\r\\nViole de Gambe 8\\r\\nFl?te harmonique 8\\r\\nBourdon 8\\r\\nPrestant 4\\r\\nOctave 4\\r\\nDoublette 2\\r\\nFourniture harmonique II-V\\r\\nCymbale harmonique II-V\\r\\nBombarde 16\\r\\nTrompette 8\\r\\nClairon 4\\r\\nChamades:\\r\\nChamade 8\\r\\nChamade 4\\r\\nChamade REC 8\\r\\nCornet REC\\r\\nMontre 16\\r\\nBourdon 16\\r\\nSalicional 8\\r\\nFl?te harmonique 8\\r\\nBourdon 8\\r\\nUnda maris 8\\r\\nPrestant 4\\r\\nFl?te douce 4\\r\\nNazard 2 2/3\\r\\nDoublette 2\\r\\nTierce 1 3/5\\r\\nFourniture V\\r\\nCymbale V\\r\\nClarinette basse 16\\r\\nClarinette 8\\r\\nClarinette aigu? 4\\r\\nRcit expressif:\\r\\nQuintaton 16\\r\\nDiapason 8\\r\\nFl?te traversire 8\\r\\nViole de Gambe 8\\r\\nBourdon cleste 8\\r\\nVoix cleste 8\\r\\nOctave 4\\r\\nFl?te Octaviante 4\\r\\nQuinte 2 2/3\\r\\nOctavin 2\\r\\nBombarde 16\\r\\nTrompette 8\\r\\nBasson Hautbois 8\\r\\nClarinette 8\\r\\nVoix humaine 8\\r\\nClairon 4\\r\\nRcit classique:\\r\\nCornet V\\r\\nHautbois 8\\r\\nChamades:\\r\\nBasse Chamade 8\\r\\nDessus Chamade 8\\r\\nChamade 4\\r\\nChamade Rgale 8\\r\\nBasse Chamade GO 8\\r\\nDessus Chamade GO 8\\r\\nChamade GO 4\\r\\nTrmolo\\r\\nBourdon 32\\r\\nPrincipal 16\\r\\nMontre 8\\r\\nFl?te harmonique 8\\r\\nQuinte 5 1/3\\r\\nPrestant 4\\r\\nTierce 3 1/5\\r\\nNazard 2 2/3\\r\\nSeptime 2 2/7\\r\\nDoublette 2\\r\\nCornet II-V\\r\\nGrande Fourniture II\\r\\nFourniture V\\r\\nCymbale V\\r\\nCromorne 8\\r\\nChamade GO 8\\r\\nChamade GO 4\\r\\nCornet REC\\r\\nHautbois REC 8\\r\\nPrincipal 8\\r\\nBourdon 8 *\\r\\nPrestant 4 *\\r\\nQuinte 2 2/3 *\\r\\nDoublette 2 *\\r\\nTierce 1 3/5 *\\r\\nLarigot 1 1/3\\r\\nSeptime 1 1/7\\r\\nPiccolo 1\\r\\nPlein jeu III-V\\r\\nCornet V (= *)\\r\\nTuba magna 16\\r\\nTrompette 8\\r\\nClairon 4\\r\\nPrincipal 32\\r\\nContrebasse 16\\r\\nSoubasse 16\\r\\nQuinte 10 2/3\\r\\nFl?te 8\\r\\nVioloncelle 8\\r\\nTierce 6 2/5\\r\\nQuinte 5 1/3\\r\\nSeptime 4 4/7\\r\\nOctave 4\\r\\nContre Bombarde 32\\r\\nBombarde 16\\r\\nBasson 16\\r\\nTrompette 8\\r\\nBasson 8\\r\\nClairon 4\\r\\nChamade GO 8\\r\\nChamade GO 4\\r\\nChamade Rgale 8\\r\\nChamade REC 8\\r\\nChamade REC 4\\r\\nBourdon 16\\r\\nPrincipal 8\\r\\nBourdon 8\\r\\nPrestant 4\\r\\nFl?te 4\\r\\nNeuvime 3 5/9\\r\\nTierce 3 1/5\\r\\nOnzime 2 10/11\\r\\nNazard 2 2/3\\r\\nFl?te 2\\r\\nTierce 1 3/5\\r\\nLarigot 1 1/3\\r\\nFlageolet 1\\r\\nFourniture III\\r\\nCymbale III\\r\\nBasson 16\\r\\nBasson 8\\r\\nVoix humaine 8\\r\\nChimes\\r\\nTremblant\\r\\nCouplers: II/I, III/I, IV/I, V/I; III/II, IV/II, V/II; IV/III, V/III; V/IV, Octave grave gnral, inversion Positif/Grand-orgue, Tirasses (Grand-orgue, Positif, Rcit, Solo, Grand-Ch?ur en 8; Grand-Orgue en 4, Positif en 4, Rcit en 4, Solo en 4, Grand-Ch?ur en 4), Sub- und Super octave couplers and Unison Off for all manuals (Octaves graves, octaves aigu?s, annulation 8').

The largest, Emmanuel, original to 1681, is located in the south tower and weighs just over 13 tons and is tolled to mark the hours of the day and for various occasions and services. This bell is always rung first, at least 5 seconds before the rest. Until recently, there were four additional 19th-century bells on wheels in the north tower, which were swing chimed. These bells were meant to replace nine which were removed from the cathedral during the Revolution and were rung for various services and festivals. The bells were once rung by hand before electric motors allowed them to be rung without manual labor. When it was discovered that the size of the bells could cause the entire building to vibrate, threatening its structural integrity, they were taken out of use. The bells also had external hammers for tune playing from a small clavier.\\r\\nOn the night of 24 August 1944 as the ?le de la Cit was taken by an advance column of French and Allied armoured troops and elements of the Resistance, it was the tolling of the Emmanuel that announced to the city that its liberation was under way.\\r\\nIn early 2012, as part of a ?2?million project, the four old bells in the north tower were deemed unsatisfactory and removed. The plan originally was to melt them down and recast new bells from the material. However, a legal challenge resulted in the bells being saved in extremis at the foundry.[13] As of early 2013, they are still merely set aside until their fate is decided. A set of 8 new bells was cast by the same foundry, Cornille-Havard, in Normandy that had cast the four in 1856. At the same time, a much larger bell called Marie was cast in Asten, Netherlands by Royal Eijsbouts  it now hangs with Emmanuel in the south tower. The 9 new bells, which were delivered to the cathedral at the same time (31 January 2013),[14] are designed to replicate the quality and tone of the cathedral's original bells.\\r\\nUnder a 1905 law, Notre-Dame de Paris is among seventy churches in Paris built before that year that are owned by the French State. While the building itself is owned by the state, the Catholic Church is the designated beneficiary, having the exclusive right to use it for religious purpose in perpetuity. The archdiocese is responsible for paying the employees, security, heating and cleaning, and assuring that the cathedral is open free to visitors. The archdiocese does not receive subsidies from the French State.[16]\\r\\nThe cathedral is renowned for its Lent sermons founded by the famous Dominican Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire in the 1860s. In recent years, however, an increasing number have been given by leading public figures and state employed academics.\\r\\nThe north transept rose\\r\\nEmmanuel, the great bourdon bell, at the Notre-Dame de Paris\\r\\nA wide angle view of Notre-Dame's western fa?ade\\r\\nNotre-Dame's facade showing the Portal of the Virgin, Portal of the Last Judgment, and Portal of St-Anne\\r\\nA view of Notre-Dame from Montparnasse Tower\\r\\nA wide angle view of Notre-Dame's western facade\\r\\nThe Statue of Virgin and Child inside Notre-Dame de Paris\\r\\nNotre-Dame's high altar with the kneeling statues of Louis XIII and Louis XIV\\r\\nOne of Notre-Dame's well known chimera statues\\r\\nSouth rose window of Notre-Dame de Paris\\r\\nNotre-Dame at the end of the 19th century\\r\\nFlying buttresses of Notre-Dame\\r\\nMemorial tablet to the British Empire dead of the First World War\\r\\nTympanum of the Last Judgment\\r\\nStatue of Joan of Arc in Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral interior\\r\\nClose look of the details on the Tympanum of the Last Judgment (2016)\\r\\nChimera \\"Le Stryge\\" overlooking Paris.","input":"Who is the notre dame cathedral dedicated to?"},{"output":"2004/05","context":"Mahendra Singh Dhoni (?pronunciation?(help{info); commonly known as MS Dhoni; born 7 July 1981) is an Indian cricketer who captained the Indian team in limited-overs formats from 11th of September 2007 to 4th of January 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 28th of December 2014. An attacking right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest finishers in limited-overs cricket.[2][3][4][5] He is also regarded to be one of the best wicket-keepers in world cricket and is known to have very fast hands.[6][7] He made his One Day International (ODI) debut in December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka.\\r\\nDhoni holds numerous captaincy records such as most wins by an Indian captain in Tests and ODIs, and most back-to-back wins by an Indian captain in ODIs. He took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid in 2007 and led the team to its first-ever bilateral ODI series wins in Sri Lanka and New Zealand. Under his captaincy, India won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the CB Series of 2007ÿ08, the 2010 Asia Cup, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. In the final of the 2011 World Cup, Dhoni scored 91 not out off 79 balls handing India the victory for which he was awarded the Man of the Match. In June 2013, when India defeated England in the final of the Champions Trophy in England, Dhoni became the first captain to win all three ICC limited-overs trophies (World Cup, Champions Trophy and the World Twenty20). After taking up the Test captaincy in 2008, he led the team to series wins in New Zealand and West Indies, and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2008, 2010 and 2013. In 2009, Dhoni also led the Indian team to number one position for the first time in the ICC Test rankings. In 2013, under his captaincy, India became the first team in more than 40 years to whitewash Australia in a Test series. In the Indian Premier League, he captained the Chennai Super Kings to victory at the 2010 and 2011 seasons, along with wins in the 2010 and 2014 editions of Champions League Twenty20. He announced his retirement from Tests on 30 December 2014.[8]\\r\\nDhoni holds the post of Vice-President of India Cements Ltd., after resigning from Air India. India Cements is the owner of the IPL team Chennai Super Kings, and Dhoni has been its captain since the first IPL season.[9][10] Dhoni is the co-owner of Indian Super League team Chennaiyin FC.[11]\\r\\nDhoni has been the recipient of many awards, including the ICC ODI Player of the Year award in 2008 and 2009 (the first player to win the award twice), the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 2007 and the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour, in 2009.[12] He was named as the captain of ICC World Test XI and ICC World ODI XI teams for 2009. The Indian Territorial Army conferred the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel[13] to Dhoni on 1 November 2011. He is the second Indian cricketer after Kapil Dev to have received this honour. In 2011, Time magazine included Dhoni in its annual Time 100 list as one of the \\"Most Influential People in the World.\\"[14] In 2012, SportsPro rated Dhoni as the sixteenth most marketable athlete in the world.[15] In June 2015, Forbes ranked Dhoni at 23rd in the list of highest paid athletes in the world, estimating his earnings at US$31 million.[16] In 2016, a biopic M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story was made on him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand),[17] and he identifies as being a Hindu Rajput.[18] His paternal village Lvali is in the Lamgarha block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand. Dhoni's parents, moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi where his father Pan Singh worked in junior management positions in MECON. Dhoni has a sister Jayanti Gupta and a brother Narendra Singh Dhoni.[19][20] Dhoni is a fan of Adam Gilchrist, and his childhood idols were cricket teammate Sachin Tendulkar, Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan and singer Lata Mangeshkar[21][22]\\r\\nDhoni studied at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali, Ranchi, Jharkhand where he initially excelled in badminton and football and was selected at district and club level in these sports. Dhoni was a goalkeeper for his football team and was sent to play cricket for a local cricket club by his football coach. Though he had not played cricket, Dhoni impressed with his wicket-keeping skills and became the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando cricket club (1995ÿ1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship and he performed well.[20] Dhoni focused on cricket after his 10th standard.[23] Dhoni was a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station from 2001 to 2003, under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal.[24][25][26] His colleagues remember him as a very honest, straightforward employee of the Indian Railways. But he also had a mischievous side to his personality. Once, while staying at the railway quarters, Dhoni and a couple of his friends covered themselves in white bedsheets and walked around in the complex late in the night. The night guards were fooled into believing that there were ghosts moving around in the complex. The story made big news on the next day.[27][28][29]\\r\\nIn 1998 Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team.[30] Till 1998 Dhoni, who was in class 12th in school, had played only school cricket and club cricket and no professional cricket. One of the famous episode when Dhoni used to play for CCL was when Deval Sahay used to gift him Rs 50 for each six that he hit in Sheesh Mahal tournament cricket matches.[31] Playing for CCL he got a chance to bat up the order. He grabbed the opportunity and scored centuries and helped CCL move to A division. Deval Sahay impressed by his hard hitting shots and dedication, used his contacts in Bihar Cricket Association to push for his selection in the Bihar team.[32] Deval Sahay, an ex Bihar Cricket Association Vice-President, was the Ranchi District Cricket President at that time and was instrumental in pushing Dhoni to the big stage of Ranchi team, junior Bihar cricket team and eventually senior Bihar Ranji Team for the 1999ÿ2000 season. In 1 year Dhoni moved from playing in CCL to the Bihar Ranji team. Dhoni was included in the Bihar U-19 squad for the 1998ÿ99 season and scored 176 runs in 5 matches (7 innings) as the team finished fourth in the group of six and did not make it to the quarter-finals. Dhoni was not picked for the East Zone U-19 squad (CK Nayudu Trophy) or Rest of India squad (MA Chidambaram Trophy and Vinoo Mankad Trophy). Bihar U-19 cricket team advanced to the finals of the 1999ÿ2000 Cooch Behar Trophy where Dhoni made 84 to help Bihar post a total of 357.[33] Bihar's efforts were dwarfed by Punjab U-19s' 839 with Dhoni's future national squad teammate Yuvraj Singh making 358.[34][35] Dhoni's contribution in the tournament included 488 runs (9 matches, 12 innings), 5 fifties, 17 catches and 7 stumpings.[36] Dhoni made it to the East Zone U-19 squad for the CK Nayudu trophy[37] but scored only 97 runs[38] in four matches as East Zone lost all four matches and finished last in the tournament. [39]\\r\\nDhoni made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999ÿ2000 season as an eighteen-year-old. He made a half century in his debut match scoring 68* in the second innings against Assam cricket team.[40] Dhoni finished the season with 283 runs in 5 matches. Dhoni scored his maiden first-class century while playing for Bihar against Bengal in the 2000/01 season in a losing cause.[41] Apart from this century, his performance in the 2000/01 season[42] did not include another score over fifty and in the 2001/02 season he scored just five fifties in four Ranji matches.[43]\\r\\nDhoni's performance in the 2002ÿ03 season included three half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy and a couple of half-centuries in the Deodhar Trophy as he started gaining recognition for his lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style. In the 2003/04 season, Dhoni scored a century (128*) against Assam in the first match of the Ranji ODI tournament. Dhoni was part of the East Zone squad that won the Deodhar Trophy 2003ÿ2004 season[44][45] and contributed with 244 runs in 4 matches,[46] including a century (114) against Central zone.[47]\\r\\nIn the Duleep Trophy finals, Dhoni was picked over international cricketer Deep Dasgupta to represent East Zone.[48] He scored a fighting half-century in the second innings in a losing cause.[49] Dhoni's talent was discovered via the BCCI's small-town talent-spotting initiative TRDW. Dhoni was discovered by TRDO Prakash Poddar, captain of Bengal in the 1960s, when he saw Dhoni play for Jharkhand at a match in Jamshedpur in 2003, and sent a report to the National Cricket Academy.[50]\\r\\nHe was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the One Day format and was picked for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya.[51] Against the Zimbabwe XI in Harare Sports Club, Dhoni had his best wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the match.[52] In the tri-nation tournament involving Kenya, India A and Pakistan A, Dhoni helped India A chase down their target of 223 against Pakistan A with a half-century.[53] Continuing his good performance, he scored back to back centuries ÿ 120[54] and 119*[55] ÿ against the same team. Dhoni scored 362 runs in 6 innings at an average of 72.40 and his performance in the series received attention from the then Indian captain ÿ Sourav Ganguly[56] and Ravi Shastri amongst others. However, the India A team coach Sandeep Patil recommended Dinesh Karthik for a place in the Indian squad as wicket-keeper/batsman.[57]\\r\\nThe Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent.[56] The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads.[56] With Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.[58] Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut.[59] In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series.[60]\\r\\nIn the second match of the series, Dhoni, in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 in Visakhapatnam off only 123 deliveries. Dhoni's 148 surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper,[61] a record that he would re-write before the end of the year.\\r\\nDhoni had few batting opportunities in the first two games of the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series (OctoberÿNovember 2005) and was promoted to No. 3 in the third ODI at Sawai Mansingh Stadium (Jaipur). Sri Lanka had set India a target of 299 after a Kumar Sangakkara century and, in reply, India lost Tendulkar early. Dhoni was promoted to accelerate the scoring and ended the game with an unbeaten 183 off 145 balls, winning the game for India.[62] The innings was described in Wisden Almanack (2006) as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but crude'.[63] The innings set various records including the highest individual score in ODI cricket in the second innings,[64] a record that still stands. Dhoni ended the series with the highest run aggregate (346)[65] and was awarded the Man of the Series award for his efforts. In December 2005, Dhoni was rewarded a B-grade contract by the BCCI.[66]\\r\\nIndia scored 328 in 50 overs with Dhoni contributing 68 in their first match of 2006 against Pakistan. However, the team finished poorly scoring just 43 runs in the last eight overs and lost the match due to Duckworth-Lewis method.[67] In the third match of the series, Dhoni came in with India in a precarious situation and scored 72 runs off just 46 balls that included 13 boundaries to help India take a 2ÿ1 lead in the series.[68][69] The final match of the series had a repeat performance as Dhoni scored 77 runs off 56 balls to enable India win the series 4ÿ1.[70] Due to his consistent ODI performances, Dhoni overtook Ricky Ponting as number one in the ICC ODI Rankings for batsmen on 20 April 2006.[71] His reign lasted just a week as Adam Gilchrist's performance against Bangladesh moved him to the top spot.[72]\\r\\nTwo cancelled series in Sri Lanka, one due to the withdrawal of South Africa from the Unitech Cup due to security concerns[73] and the replacement three-match ODI bilateral series against Sri Lanka washed due to rain,[74] was India's prelude to another disappointing tournament ÿ DLF Cup 2006-07. Dhoni scored 43 runs as the team lost twice in three games and did not qualify for the finals. India's lack of preparation showed in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy as they lost to West Indies and Australia, though Dhoni scored a half-century against West Indies. The story of the ODI series in South Africa was the same for both Dhoni and India as Dhoni scored 139 runs in 4 matches and India lost the series 4ÿ0. From the start of the West Indies ODI series, Dhoni had played 16 matches, hit just two fifties and averaged 25.93. Dhoni received criticism on his wicket-keeping technique from former wicket-keeper Syed Kirmani.[75]\\r\\nPreparations for the 2007 Cricket World Cup improved as India recorded identical 3ÿ1 victories over West Indies and Sri Lanka and Dhoni had averages in excess of 100 in both these series. However,\\r\\nIndia unexpectedly crashed out the World Cup after losses to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the group stage. Dhoni was out for a duck in both these matches and scored just 29 runs in the tournament. After the loss to Bangladesh in 2007 Cricket World Cup, the house that Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalised and damaged by political activists of JMM.[76] The local police arranged for security for his family as India exited the World Cup in the first round.[77]\\r\\nDhoni put his disappointing performances in the World Cup behind him by scoring 91* against Bangladesh after India were left in a tight spot earlier in the run-chase. Dhoni was declared the Man of the Match for his performance, his fourth in ODI cricket. He was also later adjudged the Man of the Series after the third game of the series was washed away. Dhoni had a good Afro-Asia Cup, scoring 174 runs in 3 matches at an average of 87.00, with a blitzkrieg 139 not out of 97 balls, a Man of the Match innings, in the third ODI.\\r\\nDhoni was named vice-captain of the ODI team for the series against South Africa in Ireland and the subsequent India-England seven-match ODI series.[78] Dhoni, who received a 'B' grade contract in December 2005, was awarded an 'A' grade contract in June 2007. And also he was elected as captain of the Indian squad for the World Twenty20 in September 2007. On 2 September 2007, Dhoni equaled his idol Adam Gilchrist's international record for the most dismissals in an innings in ODI by catching five English players and stumping one.[79]\\r\\nHe led India to the ICC World Twenty 20 trophy in South Africa with a victory over arch-rivals Pakistan in an intensely fought final on 24 September 2007, and became the second Indian captain to have won a World Cup in any form of cricket, after Kapil Dev.\\r\\nDuring the series between India and Australia, Dhoni hit an aggressive 124 runs in just 107 balls, in the second ODI, and a measured knock of 71 runs in 95 balls, along with Yuvraj Singh, saw India home by 6 wickets, in the third ODI. Dhoni took his first wicket in international cricket on 30 September 2009. He bowled Travis Dowlin of the West Indies out during a match of the 2009 Champions Trophy.\\r\\nDhoni topped the ICC ODI Batsman rankings for several months in 2009. Michael Hussey from Australia replaced him at the top spot at the beginning of 2010.[80]\\r\\nDhoni had an excellent year in ODIs in 2009 scoring 1198 runs in just 24 innings at an astonishing average of 70.43. Dhoni was also the joint top-scorer in ODIs in 2009 along with Ricky Ponting, but the latter having played in 30 innings.\\r\\nOn 12 February 2012, Dhoni made an unbeaten 44 to guide India to their first win over Australia at Adelaide. In the final over, he hit a monstrous six which traveled 112 metres off the bowling of Clint McKay. During the post-match presentation, he described this six as more important than the one he hit during the ICC World Cup final in 2011.[81]\\r\\nIn November 2013, Dhoni became the second India batsman after Sachin Tendulkar to aggregate 1,000 or more ODI-runs against Australia.[82]\\r\\nDhoni stepped down as captain of India in the limited over formats in January 2017, just ahead of the ODI series at home against England.[83] In the second game of the series, he scored 134 off 122 balls, that included a 256-run partnership for the fourth wicket along with Yuvraj Singh. The hundred, his tenth in ODIs, was his first in over three years.[84]\\r\\nFollowing his good one-day performance against Sri Lanka, Dhoni replaced Dinesh Karthik in December 2005 as the Indian Test wicket-keeper.[85] Dhoni scored 30 runs in his debut match that was marred by rain. Dhoni came to the crease when the team was struggling at 109/5 and as wickets kept falling around him, he played an aggressive innings and was the last man dismissed.[86] Dhoni made his maiden half-century in the second Test and his quick scoring rate (half century came off 51 balls) aided India to set a target of 436 and the Sri Lankans were bowled out for 247.[87]\\r\\nIndia toured Pakistan in JanuaryÿFebruary 2006 and Dhoni scored his maiden century in the second Test at Faisalabad. India was left in a tight spot as Dhoni was joined by Irfan Pathan with the team still 107 away from avoiding a follow-on. Dhoni played his typical aggressive innings as he brought up his maiden Test hundred in just 93 balls after scoring the first fifty in just 34 deliveries.[88]\\r\\nDhoni followed the century up with some prosaic batting performances over the next three matches, one against Pakistan that India lost and two against England that had India holding a 1ÿ0 lead. Dhoni was the top scorer in India's first innings in the third Test at Wankhede Stadium as his 64 aided India post a respectable 279 in reply to England's 400. However Dhoni and the Indian fielders dropped catches and missed many dismissal chances including a key stumping opportunity of Andrew Flintoff (14).[89] Dhoni failed to collect the Harbhajan Singh delivery cleanly as Flintoff went on to make 36 more runs as England set a target of 313 for the home team, a target that Indian were never in the reckoning. A batting collapse saw the team being dismissed for 100 and Dhoni scored just 5 runs and faced criticism for his wicket-keeping lapses as well as his shot selections.\\r\\nOn the West Indies tour in 2006, Dhoni scored a quick and aggressive 69 in the first Test at Antigua. The rest of the series was unremarkable for Dhoni as he scored 99 runs in the remaining 6 innings but his wicket-keeping skills improved and he finished the series with 13 catches and 4 stumpings. In the Test series in South Africa later that year, Dhoni's scores of 34 and 47 were not sufficient to save the second Test against the Proteas as India lost the series 2ÿ1, squandering the chance to build on their first ever Test victory in South Africa (achieved in the first Test match). Dhoni's bruised hands ruled him out of the third Test match.[90]\\r\\nOn the fourth day of the first Test match at Antigua Recreation Ground, St John's, Antigua during India's tour of West Indies, 2006, Dhoni's flick off Dave Mohammed to the midwicket region was caught by Daren Ganga. As the batsman started to walk back, captain Dravid declared the innings when confusion started as the umpires were not certain if the fielder stepped on the ropes and Dhoni stayed for the umpire's verdict. While the replays were inconclusive, the captain of the West Indies side, Brian Lara, wanted Dhoni to walk off based on the fielder's assertion of the catch. The impasse continued for more than 15 minutes and Lara's temper was on display with finger wagging against the umpires and snatching the ball from umpire Asad Rauf. Ultimately, Dhoni walked off and Dravid's declaration was effected but the game was delayed, and Lara's action was criticised by the commentators and former players. Lara was summoned by the match referee to give an explanation of his actions but he was not fined.[91]\\r\\nDhoni scored two centuries in Sri Lanka's tour of India in 2009, a series of three matches in which he led India to a 2ÿ0 victory. With this feat, India soared up to the number one position in Test cricket for the first time in history. India scored 726ÿ9 (decl) in the third match of this series, which was their highest Test total then.[92]\\r\\nHe played his last series in the 2014ÿ15 season in India's tour of Australia captaining India in the second and third tests; losing the second and drawing the third, trailing the series 2ÿ0 before the Sydney Test. Following the third Test in Melbourne, Dhoni announced his retirement from the format.[93] In his last Test, he effected 9 dismissals (8 catches and 1 stumping), and in the process, went past Kumar Sangakkara in the record for stumpings with 134 (in all three formats combined)[94] and also broke the record for effecting the most dismissals in a match by an Indian wicketkeeper.[95] He finished his last innings unbeaten making 24 runs.\\r\\nDhoni was named the captain of Indian squad for the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 held in South Africa in September 2007.[96] India were crowned champions as Dhoni led the team to victory against Pakistan in a thrilling contest.[97] He, then, went on to become the ODI captain of the Indian team for the seven-match ODI series against Australia in September 2007.[98] He made his debut as full-time Test captain of India during the fourth and final Test against Australia at Nagpur in November 2008 replacing Anil Kumble who was injured in the third test and who then announced his retirement. Dhoni was vice-captain in this series up to that point.[99] India eventually won that Test thus clinching the series 2ÿ0 and retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Dhoni had previously captained India on a stand-in basis against South Africa and Australia in 2008 and 2009 respectively.\\r\\nIt was under his captaincy that India climbed to No. 1 in the ICC Test Rankings in December 2009. After that he managed to lead India in a series-leveling world championship of Tests against the South Africans in February 2010. India also managed to draw the Test series 1ÿ1 in South Africa later that year.\\r\\nAfter winning the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup final against Sri Lanka on 2 April 2011 with his match winning knock of unbeaten 91, Tendulkar heaped praises on Dhoni, claiming him to be the best captain he has played under. Tendulkar mentioned that it was Dhoni's calm influence that was rubbing off on all his team-mates and described Dhoni's handling of pressure was incredible.\\r\\nOnly eleven players have captained ten or more Tests playing as a wicket-keeper. Dhoni leads the table with 60?Tests as captain, 35 ahead of Mushfiqur Rahim in second place.[100]\\r\\nIn March 2013, Dhoni became the most successful Indian Test captain when he eclipsed Sourav Ganguly's record of 21 victories from 49 Tests.[101] Ganguly also said in an interview to a news channel that Dhoni is the all-time greatest captain of India and he has a great record to support this credential.\\r\\nIn August 2016, Dhoni was selected as captain for India's first tour to the United States, where India played two T20Is against the West Indies in Lauderhill, Florida.[102] India lost the first match on 27 August 2016, during which Dhoni surpassed former Australian captain Ricky Ponting to become the most experienced captain in international cricket.[103]\\r\\nDhoni's final game as Indian captain was on 10 January, 2017 in a warmup match between England and India during the limited-overs leg of England Tour of India. Dhoni stated he will still fulfill his duties as captains in various domestic teams.\\r\\nAs captain of the Indian cricket team, Dhoni has seldom been suspended due to his team's slow over rate. In December 2009 he was suspended for two ODI matches against Sri Lanka by ICC match referee Jeff Crowe as India was three overs short of the specified rate; Virender Sehwag acted as captain for the two matches in Cuttack and Kolkata.[104] In January 2012 Dhoni was banned for the fourth Test match against Australia in Adelaide as India was two overs short during the third Test in Perth.[105] Sehwag captained the team in the Adelaide test and Wriddhiman Saha kept the wickets. In the CB Series in February, Dhoni again faced a one match ban for slow-over rate against Australia.[106]\\r\\nDhoni has captained India in two World Cups. Under his captaincy, India won the World Cup in 2011 and reached the semifinals in 2015.\\r\\nDhoni played his first ODI World Cup in 2007 at the Caribbean. India made an early exit from the tournament in the Group Stage. In 2007 Cricket World Cup, India was placed in Group B with Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bermuda. Rahul Dravid captained the team in this World Cup. In three matches India played, they managed to win only one against Bermuda while losing the rest from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. In their first match against Bangladesh, India was all out in just 191 in 49.3 overs. Dhoni was out for 0. He stumped Tamim Iqbal, Shakib Al Hasan and captain Habibul Bashar in the match but, India lost by 5 wickets. In the next match against Bermuda, India posted the then Highest Score in the World Cup 413/5 in a must-win match. Dhoni scored 29 off 25 Balls which includes Two 4s and One 6. India won the match by 257 runs. India was required to win their last group match against the Lankans but they lost by 69 runs. Chasing the target of 255, India crumbled to 185 all out in 43.3 overs. Dhoni was out for 0 for the second time in the tournament in his very first ball by Muttiah Muralitharan. Thus, India was out of the world cup in very first round. The Team was heavily criticized for their performance. Dhoni's under construction house in Ranchi was attacked by some 200 fans after the Bangladesh loss.\\r\\nUnder Dhoni's captaincy, India won the 2011 World Cup. In the final against Sri Lanka, chasing 275, Dhoni promoted himself up the batting order, coming before an in form Yuvraj Singh. When he came to bat India needed more than six runs per over with three top order batsmen already dismissed. He started building a good partnership with Gautam Gambhir. Due to good strokeplay and active running between wickets, they kept up with the required run rate. Dhoni was on 60 off 60 balls, but later accelerated with a greater flow of boundaries, ending with 91 not out off 79 balls. Befitting the occasion, he finished the match of in style with a huge six over long-on off bowler Nuwan Kulasekara and won Man of the Match. Later in the post-match presentation, he admitted that he came up the order so as to counter the Muralitharan spin threat as he was very familiar with Murali's bowling, who was his team-mate in the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Chennai Super Kings. He had come after the dismissal of Virat Kohli, also a right-handed batsman. By partnering the left-handed Gambhir, he ensured a right-left combination at the crease that makes it difficult for bowlers to settle into a rhythm.\\r\\nThe bat used by Dhoni in the final match was sold for ? 72 Lac. The money goes to Sakshi Rawat Foundation, operated by Dhoni's wife Sakshi Rawat to help orphan children.[107]\\r\\nFor the 2015 World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand, Dhoni was named the captain of the 30-member squad by the BCCI in December 2014.[108] Under his captaincy, India was able to go through to semi-finals with ease, beating Bangladesh in the quarter-finals. However, they lost to Australia in the semi-finals held at the Sydney Cricket Ground . The team won 7 consecutive matches in this world cup and won 11 all consecutive in world cups. With the win against Bangladesh, he became the first non-Australian captain to win 100 ODI matches, and first Indian captain to achieve the mark. He is also the third captain to win 100 matches, after two Australians, Ricky Ponting, and Allan Border.[109]\\r\\nDhoni was contracted by the Chennai Super Kings for 1.5?Million USD. This made him the most expensive player in the IPL for the first season auctions.[110] Under his captaincy, Chennai Super Kings have won two Indian Premier League titles and the 2010 Champions League Twenty20. After the suspension of CSK for two years, he was bought by Rising Pune Supergiant for 1.9 Million USD in 2016, and was named captain. However his team finished in 7th place.\\r\\nDhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. Initially, Dhoni appeared as a lower-order attacking batsman but he gradually changed his style of playing with the occurrence of pressure situation and his growing responsibility as a captain. He is a powerful hitter of the ball and one of the fastest man in running between the wickets.\\r\\nHis wicket-keeping skill is widely praised by cricket experts. He is quickest when comes to stumping.He has a world record of highest number of stumping by any wicket-keeper.He is the main wicket-keeper in the team but he occasionally bowls as a medium speed bowler.\\r\\nDhoni married Sakshi Singh Rawat, his schoolmate in DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali.[111] a native of Dehradun, Uttarakhand, on 4 July 2010.[112] At the time of their marriage, she was studying hotel management and was working as a trainee at the Taj Bengal, Kolkata. After the retirement of Sakshi's father from his tea growing business, their family shifted to their native place, Dehradun.\\r\\nThe wedding took place one day after the couple got engaged.[113][114] According to Bollywood actress Bipasha Basu, a close friend of Dhoni, the wedding was planned for months and was not a spur of the moment decision.[115] Dhoni became father on 6 February 2015 to a baby girl named Ziva.\\r\\nIn February 2016, Dhoni launched lifestyle brand SEVEN. Dhoni owns the footwear side of the brand and is also the brand ambassador of SEVEN.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nMs Dhoni is the only captain to win all ICC tournament cups.\\r\\nNote ÿ In the 2010 ICC World Twenty20, India played a Super 8 Match against West Indies. This match comes under the List of Matches played in Away Venues as the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 was being hosted in West Indies\\r\\nAlong with Sahara India Pariwar, Dhoni is also a co-owner of Ranchi based Hockey club Ranchi Rays, a franchise of the Hockey India League.[161]\\r\\nAlong with Abhishek Bachchan and Vita Dani, Dhoni is also a co-owner of Chennai based Football club Chennaiyin FC, a franchise of the Indian Super League.[162]\\r\\nDhoni's interest in bikes was often discussed in media.[163] He co-parternered Akkineni Nagarjuna in buying a Supersport World Championship team Mahi Racing Team India.\\r\\nA biographical film based on the life of Dhoni, titled M.S.

It lies in Lake Erie, just south of Pelee Island, and is part of Point Pelee National Park. It forms part of the province of Ontario. The southernmost part of the island lies some 150 metres (164 yards) from the U. S. maritime boundary. The distance to the northernmost point of land in CanadaCape Columbia, Ellesmere Islandis 4,640 kilometres (2,883 miles).\\r\\nThe southernmost point of Middle Island is at a latitude of North 4140'53\\", which is at a slightly lower latitude than the southernmost point in Michigan and slightly farther south than downtown Chicago. Twenty-seven U.S. states lie all or partly north of this point, as do European cities such as Rome and Barcelona. Thirteen states are entirely north of this latitude (Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine).[2] California, albeit only its northernmost edge, is one of the states that lies partially north of Middle Island, as the California/Oregon border is at the 42nd parallel north.\\r\\nThere are no permanent settlements on Middle Island, as the entire island is a conservation area. The most common species are double-crested cormorants, though several others also nest there. The birds are so plentiful that in May 2008, Parks Canada attempted to cull the number of cormorants from more than 4000 nests to between 400 and 800.[3] It once was the site of a lighthouse, built in 1872 but which fell into disuse by 1918.\\r\\nThe 15-metre (49?ft) pyramidal square tower burned sometime afterward, but its stone foundation is visible. Located in Canadian waters, and hence indisputably under Canadian sovereignty, the island was privately owned for years by various U.S. owners. Subsequently, Middle Island was purchased in 1999 by the Nature Conservancy of Canada, and then donated to the Canadian national park system on September 6, 2000.\\r\\nArchaeological evidence from a study done in 1982 suggests human occupation dating from 1000-1500 A.D., with one site containing remains that may date to 500 B.C. Others claim that the island has seen inhabitation for more than 10,000 years.[4] Despite early rumours of burial mounds, none were found.\\r\\nThe island is part of an archipelago across western Lake Erie, providing a natural migratory corridor for birds and other animals. It has also seen human migrations, mainly from the U.S. northward in the 19th century, including escaped slaves, prisoners of war and army deserters from the U.S. Civil War seeking asylum in mainland Ontario.\\r\\nThroughout the later decades of the 19th century, parts of Middle Island were used for growing grapes to be used in the production of wine, as was being done on Pelee Island.[4]\\r\\nDuring Prohibition, the island was a way station for alcohol en route to the United States on the south shore of Lake Erie. Gangster Joe Roscoe acquired part of the island and built a seven-bedroom \\"clubhouse\\" that became the centre of rum-running activity. The hotel offered electricity, fireplaces, and a large screened-in porch with views of the lake. The basement held a casino, carved out of solid bedrock.[5]\\r\\nIn the years after 1933, after the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution resulted in the repeal of the Volstead Act, the hotel drew as many as 200 visitors a day in peak season. Its kitchen became known for pheasant dinners.[5]\\r\\nLikely prior to the 1950s,[5] there was an airstrip of about 275 metres (900 feet) in length. The runway began and ended in water, and is now choked with vegetation.[5]\\r\\nThere was at one time a stately mansion on the island, rumoured to be a brothel some time after Prohibition.[5] Only a remnant of the foundation remains.\\r\\nWhen purchased in 1999 by the Nature Conservancy of Canada, the island had no physical improvements and had essentially become a nature preserve over the last ten years, hosting the occasional scientific visit, and curious boaters. Although part of Point Pelee National Park, Middle Island is not officially open to visitors.\\r\\nInterest in preserving the island prompted a 1982 study by Parks Canada, which recommended naming it a national natural landmark. Its ecological, historical, and aesthetic value led Essex County to include it on its list of Environmentally Sensitive Areas and an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest.

The band's seminal 1968 album In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida is among the world's 40 best-selling albums, selling more than 30 million copies.[4] Iron Butterfly is also notable for being the first group to receive an RIAA platinum award.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band formed in 1966 in San Diego.[6] The original members were Doug Ingle (vocals, organ), Jack Pinney (drums), Greg Willis (bass), and Danny Weis (guitar).[7] They were soon joined by tambourine player and vocalist Darryl DeLoach. DeLoach's parents' garage on Luna Avenue served as the site for their almost nightly rehearsals.\\r\\nJerry Penrod and Bruce Morse replaced Willis and Pinney after the band relocated to Los Angeles in 1966 and Ron Bushy then came aboard when Morse left due to a family tragedy. In early 1968, the band's debut album Heavy was released after signing a deal with ATCO, an Atlantic Records subsidiary. All but Ingle and Bushy left the band after recording the album in late 1967. The remaining musicians, faced with the possibility of the record not being released, quickly found replacements in bassist Lee Dorman and guitarist Erik Brann (also known as \\"Erik Braunn\\" and \\"Erik Braun\\") and resumed touring. They were represented by the William Morris Agency, which booked all their live concerts. DeLoach subsequently recorded with Two Guitars, Piano, Drum and Darryl, while Weis and Penrod went on to form the group Rhinoceros. In 1970, DeLoach formed Flintwhistle along with Erik Brann; the band performed live for about a year before breaking up.\\r\\nThe 17-minute \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\\", the title track of Iron Butterfly's second album, became a top-30 hit (edited down to 2:52) in the US in 1968, re-entered in late 1969, and made the number-9 spot on the Dutch Top 40 in 1970. The members when In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida was recorded were Doug Ingle (organ and vocals), Lee Dorman (bass guitar), Ron Bushy (drums), and 17-year-old Erik Brann (guitar). The album was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA in December 1968 [8] and had sold over three million copies by the end of 1970, going platinum along the way. It ultimately sold over 30 million copies[9] and stayed on the Billboard charts for over a year.\\r\\nThe band had been booked to play at Woodstock, but got stuck at LaGuardia Airport. When they called the promoters of the concert, they explained the situation and asked for patience. However, their manager sent a telegram demanding that the Butterfly be flown in by helicopter, whereupon they would \\"immediately\\" take the stage. After their set, they would be paid and flown back to the airport. According to drummer Bushy, \\"We went down to the Port Authority three times and waited for the helicopter, but it never showed up\\".[10] Woodstock Production Coordinator John Morris claims he sent the manager a telegram reading: \\"For reasons I can't go into / Until you are here / Clarifying your situation / Knowing you are having problems / You will have to find / Other transportation / Unless you plan not to come.\\" The first letter of each line in the telegram spelled out an acrostic making clear that the band was not welcome.[11]\\r\\nThe next album, Ball, reached number three on the charts and went gold, but more lineup changes followed. In 1970, with Erik Brann gone, Iron Butterfly released their fourth studio album, Metamorphosis with two new members, guitarist/vocalist Mike Pinera (whose Blues Image had opened for the Butterfly's Vida tour) and guitarist Larry \\"Rhino\\" Reinhardt. The album managed to get into the top 20, but Doug Ingle quit the group shortly after its release. Without an organist for the first time in their history, the remaining four members cut a single, \\"Silly Sally\\". It failed to chart and proved to be their last recording. The band broke up after playing a final show on May 23, 1971. Dorman and Reinhardt subsequently founded Captain Beyond.\\r\\nThe band reformed in 1974 with Ron Bushy and Erik Brann joined by bassist Philip Taylor Kramer and keyboardist Howard Reitzes. (Kramer later made news with his 1995 disappearance and the discovery of his remains and minivan at the bottom of Decker Canyon in 1999). Brann, who had done occasional lead vocals during Iron Butterfly's original run, served as the band's main lead vocalist. The album Scorching Beauty was released in January 1975 with Reitzes and Sun and Steel in October 1975 with Bill DeMartines replacing Reitzes. Both albums were criticized for bearing little resemblance to the original tone of the group, and sold poorly compared to their earlier releases.\\r\\nIn 1977, after the Bushy/Brann/Kramer/DeMartines grouping wound down, Lee Dorman put together a new IB lineup with Rhino that contained British singer Jimi Henderson, Larry Kiernan on keyboards and Kevin Karamitros on drums and toured mostly in the South. By 1978 the lineup was Dorman, Karamitros, Pinera and John Leimsider on keyboards.\\r\\nIn the late fall of 1978, a German promoter made an offer for the band to tour over there. So the Metamorphosis lineup made preparations, but just before they were to depart, Dorman's father took ill and another bassist, Keith Ellis (formely of Boxer, Spooky Tooth and his own Patto), was brought in to cover for Dorman just in case he had to leave suddenly to return to the US. But during the tour, Ellis died in Darmstadt, Germany on December 6, 1978 after complications from alcohol over consumption and an infection caused by a tooth abcess.\\r\\nAfter their return to the US, the Metamorphosis group played a few homecoming shows, joined by Erik Brann for guest appearances. But later in 1979, the lineup was: Mike Pinera, Lee Dorman, Doug Ingle, a returning John Leimsider and Dorman's Captain Beyond bandmate drummer Bobby Caldwell.\\r\\nStill later that same year, Bobby Hasbrook, from Hawaii, joined the band as lead guitarist and lead vocals alongside Dorman, Brann, Caldwell and Leimseider.\\r\\nBut IB's lineup was in a contant state flux from late 1979 on with: Brann, Dorman, Leimsider, Caldwell and Hasbrook (1979); Pinera, Brann, Dorman, Hashbrook, Caldwell and Nathan Pino - keyboards (1979); Dorman, Brann, Hasbrook, Tim Kislan - keyboards, Zam Johnson - drums and Starz Vanderlocket - vocals, percussion (1980); Dorman, Rhino, Leimsider, Randy Skirvin - guitar, Jimmy Rock - drums and Luke - vocals, percussion (1981-1982); Pinera, Dorman, Rhino, Guy Babylon - keyboards and Jan Uvena - drums (1982) plus Pinera, Brann, Dorman, Rhino, Babylon and Bushy (1982).\\r\\nOn July 31 1982, the Pinera, Brann, Dorman, Rhino, Babylon and Bushy lineup went into Music Sound Connection Studio in Studio City, CA to record some material. But to this day, none of it has been released.\\r\\nAt the tail end of 1982, Ingle returned to the fold once more as John Shearer came in on drums and a percussionist named Luke also joined since Bushy had taken a sales job outside of music for Makita Tools. Brann soon ended his association with the band at this time as well.\\r\\nPinera left again, as did Luke, in 1983 and IB worked on some more material in September of that year, with drummer Jerry Sommers playing on some tracks. But once again, nothing ever came of it.\\r\\nThen Ingle, Dorman, Rhino and drummer Rick Rotante undertook the \\"Wings of Flight Tour\\" in early 1984, with Lenny Campanero (ex-Badfinger) replacing Rotante for more recording sessions at Salty Dog Studios in Van Nuys, California.\\r\\nThe \\"Legends Tour\\" took place in the fall of 1984 with Ingle, Dorman, Campanero and guitarist Steve Fister (later of Steppenwolf) and another Steppenwolf alumni, bassist Kurtis Teal, took Dorman's spot for the \\"Phoenix Tour\\" in the fall of '85, which ended abruptly on December 2 when Teel died of a heart murmur. The group then disbanded once again due to managerial problems.\\r\\nIn May 1988, the band's classic 1968 line-up of Ingle, Bushy, Brann, and Dorman performed at the 40th-anniversary celebration of Atlantic Records at Madison Square Garden along with Led Zeppelin.\\r\\nDoug Ingle rejoined the band on vocals and keyboards from 1994 to 1999. In 1997, the band did a tour of Europe with original members Ingle, Bushy, and Dorman, along with keyboardist Derek Hilland and new guitarist Eric Barnett. A DVD of live performances from the tour was released in 2008. Ingle officially retired in 1999, and Larry Rust joined the band as keyboardist from 1999-2005.\\r\\nGuitarist/vocalist Charlie Marinkovich joined the band in 2002. Originally from Seattle, Marinkovich had played with Randy Hansen and others.[12]\\r\\nGerman violinist, keyboardist, and composer Martin Gerschwitz, who had formerly worked with Lita Ford, Meat Loaf, Walter Trout, and most recently Eric Burdon and The Animals,[13] joined the band in 2005, replacing Larry Rust.\\r\\nOriginal vocalist Darryl DeLoach (born on September 12, 1947) died of liver cancer on October 3, 2002, at the age of 55.[14][15]\\r\\nOn July 25, 2003, Erik Brann died of heart failure at the age of 52.[16]\\r\\nIn early 2010, an announcement was made that Iron Butterfly would receive the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 20th Annual San Diego Music Awards, which took place on September 12, 2010.[17] The award was presented by San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders.[18] Later the same year, Ray Weston (formerly of Wishbone Ash) came in to substitute on drums for Ron Bushy after he was sidelined by health issues. In early 2012, Phil Parlapiano substituted for Martin Gerschwitz for a few shows, when Gerschwitz was unable to play due to his own solo-tour schedule.[19]\\r\\nFormer guitarist Larry \\"Rhino\\" Reinhardt died on January 2, 2012, at the age of 63, due to cirrhosis of the liver. Bassist Lee Dorman, who had a history of heart trouble, died on December 21, 2012, at the age of 70. Both Reinhardt and Dorman were also founding members of Captain Beyond, along with former Deep Purple vocalist Rod Evans and drummer Bobby Caldwell.\\r\\nFollowing Dorman's death, Iron Butterfly dissolved once more. Charlie Marinkovich revealed in 2013 that he had departed the band altogether and that Ron Bushy was very ill, shrouding the band's future in doubt.\\r\\nAt times during his recovery in 2014, Ron Bushy entertained the idea of putting a new Iron Butterfly band together, possibly with Martin Gerschwitz returning on keyboards and lead vocals.[20]\\r\\nIn late 2014, reports surfaced of the band reforming, with a lineup consisting of Bushy, Mike Pinera, Doug Ingle, Jr., on keyboards, and an unnamed bassist.[21] However, this reformation did not come to fruition and in 2015 the band unveiled a lineup consisting of Bushy and returning guitarist Eric Barnett, along with new members Mike Green (percussion), Dave Meros (bass), Phil Parlapiano (keyboards), and Ray Weston {drums}. Meros, Parlapiano, and Weston have all previously played with Iron Butterfly as substitute musicians; Meros for Dorman (in 2006) and Weston for Bushy (in 2010), respectively. At present, Ron Bushy remains a member of Iron Butterfly, but is not performing due to his health concerns, leaving Weston as sole drummer for the band at current appearances.[22]\\r\\nFormer Butterfly keyboardist Larry Rust died peacefully at his home near Los Angeles on November 25, 2016 at the age of 63.\\r\\nDisbanded\\r\\nDisbanded\\r\\nDisbanded\\r\\n(Contained video performances of \\"Easy Rider\\" (3:21), \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\\" (17:03) and \\"Butterfly Bleu\\" (19:51))\\r\\n(Contained video performances of the full concert at Itchycoo Park in 1999)","input":"In what city was the band iron butterfly initially formed?"},{"output":"the Chameleon","context":"Spider-Man is a fictional superhero in the Marvel Universe debuting in the anthology comic book series issue Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comics published by Marvel Comics. After his debut he would get his own comic book entitled The Amazing Spider-Man. The comic book series would introduce many of what would become his major supervillain adversaries. Spider-Man would then be popular enough for more Spider-Man comic spinoffs (The Spectacular Spider-Man, Marvel Team-Up, Web of Spider-Man, Peter Parker: Spider-Man etc.) which potentially introduced more recurring enemies of the web-slinger.\\r\\nAs with Spider-Man, the theme behind the villains' powers originate with scientific accidents or the misuse of scientific technology and also tend to have animal-themed costumes or powers (Vulture, Doctor Octopus, Beetle, Lizard, Rhino, Scorpion, Kraven the Hunter, Jackal and Black Cat). There also consists supervillains with the powers over the elements (Sandman, Shocker, Electro, Molten Man and Hydro-Man), some that are horror-themed (the Goblins, Morbius, Morlun, and the Symbiotes) and some that are crime lords (Kingpin, Tinkerer, Tombstone, Hammerhead, Silvermane and Mister Negative).[1] His rogue also consisted of some that are masters of trickery and deception (Chameleon and Mysterio).[2] These villains oftentimes form teams such as the Sinister Six to oppose the superhero.\\r\\nThe rogues gallery of Spider-Man has garnered many positive reviews and has been considered as one of the greatest rogues gallery of all time by many alongside Batman's rogues gallery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of supervillains depicted in Spider-Man comics first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man while some first appeared in later spinoff comics such as The Spectacular Spider-Man and Marvel Team-Up and other titles.\\r\\nMost of the supervillains of Spider-Man would be introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man comic book starting with the Chameleon.[3] The early villains would be introduced in the 1960s in the Silver Age of Comic Books.[3] Originally created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.[3] John Romita, Sr. would soon replace Ditko starting with the Rhino.[4] Gerry Conway later replaced Stan Lee and helped create new adversaries for the web-slinger and also helped pave the way to the Bronze Age of Comic Books with depicting Green Goblin as the killer of Spider-Man's long time romantic interest, Gwen Stacy.[5][6][7] Many collaborators would soon take over The Amazing Spider-Man title. One of the more popular examples included Todd McFarlane's Venom in the Modern Age of Comic Books.[8] Note: Alter ego characters who are the most high profile in the supervillain alias but others have shared that supervillain name are in bold.

Many other anti-heroes were introduced in the 1970s in between the Silver Age and the Bronze Age while Humbug was introduced in the 1980s right around the start of the Modern Age. Kaine is the youngest debuted character while Cardiac is the second youngest. Both Kaine and Cardiac appeared around the 1990s.\\r\\nThe Burglar and Flash Thompson both appeared in the first comic book starring Spider-Man appearing in the anthology series Amazing Fantasy.

All three of the characters listed appeared in the 1960s around the Silver Age of Comics.\\r\\nDelilah first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #414 by Tom DeFalco and Mark Bagley.[27] The Rose's confidante as well as his chief enforcer, Delilah helped battle to maintain control of part of the New York crime scene against the threat of the Black Tarantula.[111][112]\\r\\nDuring her career, she had a role in the rebirth of two of Spider-Man's old foes during the Rose's efforts to gain extra muscle: she was the one who threw the switch of the electric chair which gave Electro his powers back, and helped set up the theft of Doctor Octopus' corpse for re-animation from the Hand. She also appears in Loners as an assassin smuggling MGH.[113][114][115][116]\\r\\nSpidercide was a major antagonist in the Maximum Clonage story arc. He first appeared in The Spectacular Spider-Man #222 by Tom DeFalco and Sal Buscema.[67] He is depicted as an evil foil of Spider-Man, Ben Reilly, and Kaine. Introduced as a red herring to suggest the possibility of a third individual that was the original Peter Parker, he is one of the Spider-Man clones created by Jackal, to be Jackal's enforcer and protector. However, Spidercide is actually a clone to Ben Reilly, who is a direct genetic duplicate of Spider-Man.[40]\\r\\nHe first appeared as a Peter Parker double emerging from one of the Jackal's pods that believed himself to be the real Peter Parker, having been kept in stasis since the first Clone Saga. He claimed that both Peter Parker and Ben Reilly were his clones. However, upon meeting Parker, Reilly and Kaine, the Jackal's programming kicked in and he went insane before shapeshifting into a freakish giant, and thus revealing his true status as a clone. In denial of the truth, he tried to kill the \\"clones\\" and to claim Peter Parker's life as his own. He was even infatuated with Parker's wife Mary Jane Watson and seeks to have her as his bride. Since their first encounter, Reilly realizes that Spidercide is twisted from the start and expresses disgust of his corrupted doppelg?nger's immorality, tauntingly refers him as \\"Freakface\\" once the villainous clone's shapeshifting powers manifest. However, this also causes Reilly to be afraid of his and Parker's capabilities for wicked if they allow themselves demoralize as Spidercide.\\r\\nThe Jackal later modified Spidercide's powers, granting him the unique ability to control his physical make-up on a molecular level; he can alter his mass, density, shape and state at will similar to the symbiotes.

They opined that the scope of their schemes, how cool their powers are, and how dramatically they have affected Spider-Man's life is what makes the Spider-Man villains so great.[1] Newsarama ranked Spider-Man's rogues gallery as number one out ten as the greatest rogues gallery of all time.[137]\\r\\nGeorge Marston of Newsarama explaining why he felt that Spider-Man rogues gallery was the best was the thematic elements that the villains of Spider-Man manifested.[137] He explained that just like the superhero they have the same concept of science gone wrong.

There is normally only one adult, mated queen in a hive, in which case the bees will usually follow and fiercely protect her.\\r\\nThe term \\"queen bee\\" can be more generally applied to any dominant reproductive female in a colony of a eusocial bee species other than honey bees. However, as in the Brazilian stingless bee Schwarziana quadripunctata, a single nest may have multiple queens or even dwarf queens, ready to replace a dominant queen in a case of sudden death.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen conditions are favorable for swarming, the queen will start laying eggs in queen cups. A virgin queen will develop from a fertilized egg. The young queen larva develops differently because it is more heavily fed royal jelly, a protein-rich secretion from glands on the heads of young workers. If not for being heavily fed royal jelly, the queen larva would develop into a regular worker bee. All bee larvae are fed some royal jelly for the first few days after hatching but only queen larvae are fed the jelly exclusively. As a result of the difference in diet, the queen will develop into a sexually mature female, unlike the worker bees.\\r\\nQueens are raised in specially constructed queen cells. The fully constructed queen cells have a peanut-like shape and texture. Queen cells start out as queen cups. Queen cups are larger than the cells of normal brood comb and are oriented vertically instead of horizontally. Worker bees will only further build up the queen cup once the queen has laid an egg in a queen cup. In general, the old queen starts laying eggs into queen cups when conditions are right for swarming or supersedure. Swarm cells hang from the bottom of a frame while supersedure queens or emergency queens are generally raised in cells built out from the face of a frame.\\r\\nAs the young queen larva pupates with her head down, the workers cap the queen cell with beeswax. When ready to emerge, the virgin queen will chew a circular cut around the cap of her cell. Often the cap swings open when most of the cut is made, so as to appear like a hinged lid.\\r\\nDuring swarming season, the old queen will likely leave with the prime swarm before the first virgin queen emerges from a queen cell.\\r\\nA virgin queen is a queen bee that has not mated with a drone. Virgins are intermediate in size between workers and mated, laying queens, and are much more active than the latter. They are hard to spot while inspecting a frame, because they run across the comb, climbing over worker bees if necessary, and may even take flight if sufficiently disturbed. Virgin queens can often be found clinging to the walls or corners of a hive during inspections.\\r\\nVirgin queens appear to have little queen pheromone and often do not appear to be recognized as queens by the workers. A virgin queen in her first few hours after emergence can be placed into the entrance of any queenless hive or nuc and acceptance is usually very good, whereas a mated queen is usually recognized as a stranger and runs a high risk of being killed by the older workers.\\r\\nWhen a young virgin queen emerges from a queen cell, she will generally seek out virgin queen rivals and attempt to kill them. Virgin queens will quickly find and kill (by stinging) any other emerged virgin queen (or be dispatched themselves), as well as any unemerged queens. Queen cells that are opened on the side indicate that a virgin queen was likely killed by a rival virgin queen. When a colony remains in swarm mode after the prime swarm has left, the workers may prevent virgins from fighting and one or several virgins may go with after-swarms. Other virgins may stay behind with the remnant of the hive. Some virgins have been seen to escape the hive to avoid being killed and seek out another without a queen, such as in the eusocial bee Melipona scutellaris.[3] As many as 21 virgin queens have been counted in a single large swarm.[citation needed] When the after-swarm settles into a new home, the virgins will then resume normal behavior and fight to the death until only one remains. If the prime swarm has a virgin queen and the old queen, the old queen will usually be allowed to live. The old queen continues laying. Within a couple of weeks she will die a natural death and the former virgin, now mated, will take her place.\\r\\nUnlike the worker bees, the queen's stinger is not barbed and she is able to sting repeatedly without dying.\\r\\nPiping describes a noise made by virgin and mated queen bees during certain times of the virgin queens' development. Fully developed virgin queens communicate through vibratory signals: \\"quacking\\" from virgin queens in their queen cells and \\"tooting\\" from queens free in the colony, collectively known as piping. A virgin queen may frequently pipe before she emerges from her cell and for a brief time afterwards. Mated queens may briefly pipe after being released in a hive.\\r\\nPiping is most common when there is more than one queen in a hive. It is postulated that the piping is a form of battle cry announcing to competing queens and the workers their willingness to fight. It may also be a signal to the worker bees which queen is the most worthwhile to support.\\r\\nThe piping sound is a G? (aka A?). The adult queen pipes for a two-second pulse followed by a series of quarter-second toots. [4] The queens of Africanized bees produce more vigorous and frequent bouts of piping because they are more aggressive.\\r\\nThe surviving virgin queen will fly out on a sunny, warm day to a \\"drone congregation area\\" where she will mate with 12-15 drones. If the weather holds, she may return to the drone congregation area for several days until she is fully mated. Mating occurs in flight. The young queen stores up to 6 million sperm from multiple drones in her spermatheca. She will selectively release sperm for the remaining 2ÿ7 years of her life.[5]\\r\\nThe young virgin queen has a limited time to mate. If she is unable to fly for several days because of bad weather and remains unmated, she will become a \\"drone layer.\\" Drone-laying queens usually signal the death of the colony, because the workers have no fertilized (female) larvae from which to raise worker bees or a replacement queen. (Pearcy et al. 2004)\\r\\nThough timing can vary, matings usually take place between the sixth and tenth day after the queen emerges. Egg laying usually begins 2 to 3 days after the queen returns to the beehive, but can start earlier than this.[6]\\r\\nA special, rare case of reproduction is thelytoky: the reproduction of female workers or queens by laying worker bees. Thelytoky occurs in the Cape bee, Apis mellifera capensis, and has been found in other strains at very low frequency.\\r\\nAs the queen ages her pheromone output diminishes. A queen bee that becomes old, or is diseased or failing, is replaced by the workers in a procedure known as \\"supersedure\\".\\r\\nSupersedure may be forced by a beekeeper, for example by clipping off one of the queen's middle or posterior legs. This makes her unable to properly place her eggs at the bottom of the brood cell; the workers detect this and then rear replacement queens. When a new queen becomes available, the workers kill the reigning queen by \\"balling\\" her, clustering tightly around her. Death through balling is accomplished by surrounding the queen bee and raising her body temperature, causing her to overheat and die. Balling is often a problem for beekeepers attempting to introduce a replacement queen.\\r\\nIf a queen suddenly dies, the workers will attempt to create an \\"emergency queen\\" by selecting several brood cells where a larva has just emerged which are then flooded with royal jelly. The worker bees then build larger queen cells over the normal-sized worker cells which protrude vertically from the face of the brood comb. Emergency queens are usually smaller and less prolific than normal queens.\\r\\nAlthough the name might imply it, a queen bee does not directly control the hive. Her sole function is to serve as the reproducer. A well-mated and well-fed queen of quality stock can lay about 1,500 eggs per day during the spring build-upmore than her own body weight in eggs every day. She is continuously surrounded by worker bees who meet her every need, giving her food and disposing of her waste. The attendant workers also collect and then distribute queen mandibular pheromone, a pheromone that inhibits the workers from starting queen cells.[7]\\r\\nThe queen bee is able to control the sex of the eggs she lays. The queen lays a fertilized (female) or unfertilized (male) egg according to the width of the cell. Drones are raised in cells that are significantly larger than the cells used for workers. The queen fertilizes the egg by selectively releasing sperm from her spermatheca as the egg passes through her oviduct.\\r\\nThe queen bee's abdomen is longer than the worker bees surrounding her and also longer than a male bee's. Even so, in a hive of 60,000 to 80,000 honey bees, it is often difficult for beekeepers to find the queen with any speed; for this reason, many queens in non-feral colonies are marked with a light daub of paint on their thorax. The paint used does no harm to the queen and makes her much easier to find when necessary.\\r\\nAlthough the color is sometimes randomly chosen, professional queen breeders use a color that identifies the year a queen hatched, which helps them to decide whether their queens are too old to maintain a strong hive and need to be replaced. The mnemonic taught to assist beekeepers in remembering the colour order is Will You Raise Good Bees (white, yellow, red, green, blue). Sometimes tiny convex disks marked with identification numbers (Opalithpl?ttchen) are used when a beekeeper has many queens born in the same year.\\r\\nQueen rearing is the process by which beekeepers raise queen bees from young fertilized worker bee larvae. The most commonly used method is known as the Doolittle method.[8] In the Doolittle method, the beekeeper grafts larvae, which are 24 hours or less of age, into a bar of queen cell cups. The queen cell cups are placed inside of a cell-building colony.[9]A cell-building colony is a strong, well-fed, queenless colony that feeds the larva royal jelly and develops the larvae into queen bees.[10]\\r\\nAfter approximately ten days, the queen cells are transferred from the cell building colony to small mating nuclei colonies, which are placed inside of mating yards. The queen cells hatch inside of the mating nuclei.? After approximately 7-10 days, the virgin queens take their mating flights, mate with 10-20 drone bees, and return to their mating nuclei as mated queen bees.

Einhard was a dedicated servant of Charlemagne and his son Louis the Pious; his main work is a biography of Charlemagne, the Vita Karoli Magni, \\"one of the most precious literary bequests of the early Middle Ages.\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEinhard was from the eastern German-speaking part of the Frankish Kingdom. Born into a family of landowners of some importance, his parents sent him to be educated by the monks of Fulda - one of the most impressive centres of learning in the Frank lands. Perhaps due to his small stature, which restricted his riding and sword-fighting ability, Einhard concentrated his energies towards scholarship and especially to the mastering of Latin.[2] He was accepted into the hugely wealthy court of Charlemagne around 791 or 792. Charlemagne actively sought to amass scholarly men around him and established a royal school led by the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin. Einhard evidently was a talented builder and construction manager, because Charlemagne put him in charge of the completion of several palace complexes including Aachen and Ingelheim. Despite the fact that Einhard was on intimate terms with Charlemagne, he never achieved office in his reign. In 814, on Charlemagne's death his son Louis the Pious made Einhard his private secretary. Einhard retired from court during the time of the disputes between Louis and his sons in the spring of 830.\\r\\nHe died at Seligenstadt in 840.\\r\\nEinhard was married to Emma, of whom (as of most laywomen of the period) little is known. There is a possibility that their marriage bore a son, Vussin. Their marriage also appears to have been exceptionally liberal for the period, with Emma being as active as Einhard, if not more so, in the handling of their property.[3] It is said that in the later years of their marriage Emma and Einhard abstained from sexual relations, choosing instead to focus their attentions on their many religious commitments. Though he was undoubtedly devoted to her, Einhard wrote nothing of his wife until after her death on 13 December 835, when he wrote to a friend that he was reminded of her loss in every day, in every action, in every undertaking, in all the administration of the house and household, in everything needing to be decided upon and sorted out in my religious and earthly responsibilities.[4]\\r\\nEinhard made numerous references to himself as a \\"sinner\\", a description of himself that shows his Augustinian influenced world view.[5] To assuage such feelings of guilt he erected churches at both of his estates in Michelstadt and Mulinheim. In Michelstadt he also saw fit to build a basilica completed in 827 and then sent a servant, Ratleic, to Rome with an end to find relics for the new building. Once in Rome, Ratleic robbed a catacomb of the bones of the Martyrs Marcellinus and Peter and had them translated to Michelstadt. Once there, the relics made it known they were unhappy with their new tomb and thus had to be moved again to Mulinheim. Once established there, they proved to be miracle workers. Although unsure as to why these saints should choose such a \\"sinner\\" as their patron, Einhard nonetheless set about ensuring they continued to receive a resting place fitting of their honour.[6] Between 831 and 834 he founded a Benedictine Monastery and, after the death of his wife, served as its Abbot until his own death in 840.\\r\\nLocal lore from Seligenstadt portrays Einhard as the lover of Emma, one of Charlemagne's daughters, and has the couple elope from court. Charlemagne found them at Seligenstadt (then called Obermhlheim) and forgave them. This account is used to explain the name \\"Seligenstadt\\" by folk etymology.[7] Einhard and his wife were originally buried in one sarcophagus in the choir of the church in Seligenstadt, but in 1810 the sarcophagus was presented by the Grand Duke of Hesse to the count of Erbach, who claims descent from Einhard as the husband of Imma, the reputed daughter of Charlemagne. The count put it in the famous chapel of his castle at Erbach in the Odenwald.[8]\\r\\nThe most famous of Einhard's works is his biography of Charlemagne, the Vita Karoli Magni, \\"The Life of Charlemagne\\" (c. 817ÿ836), which provides much direct information about Charlemagne's life and character, written sometime between 817 and 830. In composing this he relied heavily upon the Royal Frankish Annals. Einhard's literary model was the classical work of the Roman historian Suetonius, the Lives of the Caesars, though it is important to stress that the work is very much Einhard's own, that is to say he adapts the models and sources for his own purposes. His work was written as a praise of Charlemagne, whom he regarded as a foster-father (nutritor) and to whom he was a debtor \\"in life and death\\". The work thus contains an understandable degree of bias, Einhard taking care to exculpate Charlemagne in some matters, not mention others, and to gloss over certain issues which would be of embarrassment to Charlemagne, such as the morality of his daughters; by contrast, other issues are curiously not glossed over, like his concubines.\\r\\nEinhard is also responsible for three other extant works: a collection of letters, On the Translations and the Miracles of SS. Marcellinus and Petrus, and On the Adoration of the Cross.[9][10] The latter dates from ca. 830 and was not rediscovered until 1885,[11] when Ernst Dmmler identified a text in a manuscript in Vienna as the missing Libellus de adoranda cruce,[12] which Einhard had dedicated to his pupil Lupus Servatus.[13][14]","input":"When did einhard write the life of charlemagne?"},{"output":"Aragog","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nRubeus Hagrid is a fictional character in the Harry Potter book series written by J. K. Rowling. He is introduced in Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone as a half-giant and half-human who is the gamekeeper and Keeper of Keys and Grounds of Hogwarts, the primary setting for the first six novels. In the third novel Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Hagrid is promoted to Care of Magical Creatures teacher, and is later revealed to be a member of the Order of the Phoenix.\\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid was among the characters that Rowling says she created on \\"the very first day\\".[1] She has explained the source of his name as \\"another old English word, meaning?ÿ if you were hagrid?ÿ its a dialect word?ÿ youd had a bad night. Hagrid is a big drinker?ÿ he has a lot of bad nights.\\"[2] His first name, Rubeus, was named after red in Latin to reflect alchemy and his paternal contrast to Albus Dumbledore: his \\"passion\\" to Dumbledore's \\"asceticism\\".[3] In her article \\"Harrys Fame\\", Rosemary Goring notes the Forest of Dean is an influence on Rowlings work, and Hagrid is the only character that is \\"directly drawn from the Forest of Dean\\". According to Goring, Hagrids \\"dropped word-endings are a Chepstow speciality.\\" She also claims that Hagrid is physically \\"modeled on the Welsh chapter of Hells Angels whod swoop down on the town and hog the bar, 'huge mountains of leather and hair\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character of Hagrid and conversations between him, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger in his hut are expository through the series, due to the fact that the trio frequently discover things about Albus Dumbledore and Hogwarts by talking with Hagrid, as he has a habit of letting slip bits of information that were specifically confided to him. He was also one of the first characters to imply that the idea of thinking of wizards as \\"pure-bloods\\" and \\"half-bloods\\" is a dated concept.\\r\\n\\r\\nRowling has stated in an interview that Hagrid was in Gryffindor house during his time as a student.[5] When he comes into possession of an acromantula, he is expelled from Hogwarts as his pet is believed to be the \\"monster of Slytherin\\". However, persuaded by Dumbledore (who at the time was Transfiguration teacher), Headmaster Armando Dippet agrees to train Hagrid as gamekeeper, allowing the boy to remain at Hogwarts. By the time Harry attends Hogwarts, Hagrid is also the Keeper of Keys and Grounds: the former, according to Rowling, means \\"that he will let you in and out of Hogwarts.\\"[6] Part of his job includes leading the first years across the lake in boats, upon their initial arrival at Hogwarts.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen discussing the killing off of characters in her books, Rowling said that she always knew she was \\"working towards the point where Hagrid carried Harry out alive?ÿ but supposedly dead?ÿ out of the forest\\". She said she had planned from very early on that Harry would walk to his death accompanied by the 'ghosts', and that \\"he would emerge in Hagrid's arms\\". In her own words, \\"that's what always kept Hagrid safe\\". She said \\"Hagrid would have been a natural to kill in some ways\\", but that the mental image of this moment?ÿ a big fatherly Hagrid carrying the limp Harry in his arms?ÿ was so strong it decided his fate. She also liked the circular notion of Hagrid both bringing Harry into the world, and then bringing him back from the dead.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid is introduced in the opening chapter of the first novel. Following the death of James and Lily Potter, Dumbledore entrusts Hagrid with rescuing the infant Harry from his parents' house after they have been murdered by Lord Voldemort. When Minerva McGonagall expresses her concern about the fact that it was Hagrid who would carry Harry to the Dursleys', Dumbledore says that he would trust Hagrid with his life, a fact that is demonstrated several times during the series, as Dumbledore frequently asks him to carry out secret tasks. Ten years later, he is tasked to bring the Philosophers Stone from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and provides the three-headed dog Fluffy to guard it. Dumbledore also gives him the task of locating Harry, helping him to find his bearings in the wizarding world and to buy his school things. Hagrid is the first member of the Hogwarts staff to be introduced to Harry before he began attending the school. Hagrid later becomes friends with Ron and Hermione as well. Later in the book, a hooded person (Quirinus Quirrell in disguise) gives him a dragon egg to elicit details about Fluffy. Hagrid lets slip to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that the way to get past Fluffy is to play music, for which they use the flute Hagrid himself carved for Harry, which allows them to pursue the potential thief. The three also assist Hagrid after the dragon egg hatches, by helping to remove the baby dragon Norbert, who is taken to live in a dragon sanctuary in Romania where Rons older brother, Charlie Weasley, works.\\r\\n\\r\\nReaders first discover why Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts in the second novel. It is revealed that Hagrid was a student at Hogwarts at the same time as Tom Marvolo Riddle, the wizard who later became Lord Voldemort. Hagrid was expelled during his third year, after being caught in the company of Aragog, a dangerous acromantula: this already serious crime seemed worse than it was, due to the belief that the acromantula was \\"The Monster of Slytherin\\", and that Hagrid had released it from the Chamber of Secrets and allowed it to attack students. Aragog escapes into the dark forest and starts a colony of spiders. The belief of Hagrid's guilt was encouraged by Tom Riddle, the actual criminal, who had been using the true monster (a basilisk) to attack students, and who had framed Hagrid to prevent the school from being closed, because he didn't want to return to the orphanage whence he had come. During the events of the second book, the Basilisk is unleashed once again and Hagrid is sent to the prison of Azkaban, as he is believed again to be responsible for the attacks. However, before being arrested, Hagrid tells Harry and Ron to \\"follow the spiders\\", so that they can meet Aragog and discover the identity of the true monster. After Harry defeats the Basilisk and uncovers the truth, Hagrid is freed from prison.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the resignation of Silvanus Kettleburn, who, according to Dumbledore, wanted to spend time with his remaining limbs, Hagrid is assigned to teach the subject of Care of Magical Creatures in the third novel. He is also allowed to perform magic again since his name has been cleared after the events of the previous book.[8] During his first class, in which he introduces the hippogriffs to third-years, one of the beasts, Buckbeak, attacks Draco Malfoy after the boy insults it. Although Dumbledore manages to prove that Hagrid is innocent, the Ministry of Magic sentences Buckbeak to death. Thus, Hagrid's classes become extremely boring, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione spend some time looking for information that would help Hagrid in Buckbeaks defence. Near the end of the book Hermione and Harry use a time-turner to save Buckbeak from death and Sirius Black from the Dementor's Kiss.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth novel it is revealed that Hagrid is of mixed wizard and giant parentage, his mother having been the giantess Fridwulfa, who left his wizard father when Hagrid was a baby. Since giants have a reputation for being brutal, and were once allies of Voldemort, Hagrid keeps his parentage a secret and allows people to imagine other reasons for his great size (such as drinking a bottle of Skele-Gro when he did not need it). Hagrids parentage is exposed in the Daily Prophet by Rita Skeeter, who portrays him as dangerous (because of his fascination for aggressive creatures) and incompetent. Hagrid is gravely affected by this and attempts to resign from his post as teacher, though Dumbledore does not accept his resignation. During the novel, Hagrid develops a romantic interest with Olympe Maxime?ÿ another half-giant witch and Headmistress of the French magic school Beauxbatons. Hagrid is also one of the very few people who, since the beginning, believes Harrys word that he did not apply to enter the Triwizard Tournament. Later in the book, Alastor Moody (impersonated by Barty Crouch Jr) suggests Hagrid should show Harry that the first task of the Tournament would involve dragons. Hagrid also provides Blast-Ended Skrewts for the third task.\\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid is absent during the first part of the fifth novel. The character later reveals to Harry, Ron and Hermione that he and Madame Maxime travelled across Europe together on a mission from the Order, planning to find giants and convince them to ally themselves with the good side and with Dumbledore; however, Death Eaters also find the giants and managed to get them to Voldemorts side. Hagrid is attacked by giants during the mission, and saved by Maxime. Hagrid and Maxime eventually part on the journey home because of Maximes exasperation with Grawp, Hagrids half-brother whom he had found and was attempting to bring home with them. Grawp, who wanted to stay with the giants, seriously injured Hagrid. Hagrid introduces his half-brother to Harry and Hermione, and asks them to take care of him after he leaves Hogwarts. High Inquisitor of Hogwarts Dolores Umbridge supervises the classes of all the members of the Hogwarts staff, including Hagrid's, and she looks for an excuse to fire him, as Hagrid is close to Dumbledore. Towards the end of the book, Umbridge and other Ministry officials attempt to arrest Hagrid. The latter manages to escape, but Professor McGonagall is injured whilst trying to defend him. Finally, with Dumbledores post as Headmaster restored, Hagrid returns to Hogwarts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the sixth novel, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are no longer students of Care of Magical Creatures, and Hagrid is both angry and disappointed with them during the first part of the book, but he soon realises that it is not because they do not like him. Later in the novel, Aragog dies, and Hagrid risks his life to recover the acromantula's body to give it a proper funeral. After the funeral, he and Horace Slughorn drink excessive amounts of Firewhisky, and Harry takes advantage of this situation (under the influence of Felix Felicis potion, otherwise known as \\"liquid luck\\") to retrieve a certain memory from Slughorn. Towards the end of the book, Death Eaters attack Hogwarts and Hagrid's hut is set on fire as he tries to fight them.  During Dumbledores funeral, Hagrid is seen carrying the Headmasters body.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the seventh novel, Hagrid is part of the Order of the Phoenix delegation assigned to remove Harry from the Dursleys' home to the magic-protected Burrow. Hagrid takes Harry on the flying motorcycle he inherited from Sirius but the plan goes awry when the Order delegation is ambushed by Death Eaters. The pair narrowly make it to the Burrow after being attacked by Voldemort himself. After attending Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacours wedding reception, Hagrid does not appear again until near the end of the book when it is revealed he has been driven into hiding in the mountains by the new Death Eater regime at Hogwarts.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the climactic battle, Hagrid attempts to come to the defence of Aragog's carnivorous children, who have been driven out of the Forbidden Forest by the Death Eaters and are now attacking both Hogwarts defenders and Death Eaters indiscriminately, but he is carried off by a swarm of them. He later turns up, captive in the Death Eaters' camp, when Harry sacrifices himself to Voldemort. Hagrid is forced to carry Harry back to the school, not realising that Harry has survived again, and en route accuses the watching Centaurs of not doing enough to help. The Centaurs soon afterward join the fray and Hagrid takes part in the second half of the battle, felling his main nemesis among the Death Eaters, the magical-creature executioner Walden Macnair.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Rowling, the scene in the final book in which Hagrid is seen carrying Harrys apparently dead body is very significant as \\"Hagrid brings Harry from the Dursleys. He takes him into the wizarding world ... He was sort of his guardian and his guide ... And now I wanted Hagrid to be the one to lead Harry out of the forest.\\"[9] Rowling also commented that Hagrid was never in danger of dying, as she \\"always had that picture in my head of the huge gigantic Hagrid walking through the forest crying with Harry in his arms\\".[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nNineteen years after Voldemorts defeat, Hagrid is still at Hogwarts and invites Harry and Ginny Weasley's second son Albus Severus Potter to his hut for tea, just as he had once done for Harry himself. During an interview in 2007, when asked if Hagrid did marry, Rowling answered that Hagrid developed a relationship with a giantess but it did not work out.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nScottish actor Robbie Coltrane has portrayed Hagrid in all of the film adaptations of the Harry Potter novels.[12] Robin Williams was interested for the role and approached Chris Columbus, the director of the first two films, about participating in the project but Columbus rejected him due to the \\"all-British and Irish cast\\" policy.[13][14] Rowling had wanted Coltrane for the role from the start,[13] responding \\"RobbieColtraneforHagrid\\" all in one quick breath when asked who was the top of her list of casting choices.[15][16] Coltrane was already a fan of the books[17] and has commented that being part of the Harry Potter franchise was \\"a fantastic thing.\\"[18] Rowling discussed Hagrid's past and future with Coltrane, assisting him in preparing for the role.[17][19] She also stated that \\"Robbie is just perfect for Hagrid because Hagrid is a very loveable character, quite likeable, quite comic [...] but he had to have?ÿ you really do have to sense?ÿ a certain toughness underneath [...] and I think Robbie does that perfectly.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer English rugby union player Martin Bayfield portrayed Hagrid as a stunt performer in longer shots due to his large size to emphasise Hagrids height. Bayfield also appeared as a young Hagrid in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Philosophers Stone, Hagrid is mentioned as being twice as tall as the average man and nearly five times as wide but in the film, he is portrayed as being 8?ft 6?in (2.59?m) and in later books he is said to be three times as wide.[citation needed] Hagrid is known for his thick West Country accent. Being a half-giant, he is less vulnerable to jinxes and spells than full-humans. In Order of the Phoenix, when Umbridge and some other wizards come to remove him from Hogwarts he fights back. They try to jinx and stun him, but the spells just bounce off him because of giant-inherited resistance to magic. Hagrid also shows this resilience at the end of Half-Blood Prince, during the chapter Flight of the Prince, withstanding a Death Eaters powerful curses. Some potions are also ineffective with him, such as Polyjuice Potion, which is designed for human-only use.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has a friendly, softhearted personality and is easily driven to tears, as seen in his very first scene, when he drops Harry off at the Dursleys' in Philosophers Stone. He is very loyal to his peers, especially Dumbledore, to whom he refers as the greatest wizard in the world multiple times. As first seen in Philosophers Stone, he becomes extremely angry whenever anyone insults Dumbledore around him (a mistake made by Vernon Dursley, who called Dumbledore a \\"crackpot old fool\\"). He is also very loyal to Harry, suffered several times during the series because of this loyalty, and had to go into hiding twice to avoid prison. Rowling says of Hagrid, \\"Hagrid was always supposed to be this almost elemental force. Hes like the king of the forest, or the Green Man. Hes this semi-wild person who lives on the edge of the forest\\".[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing his expulsion from Hogwarts, the Ministry of Magic broke Hagrids oak wand and forbade him to perform magic.[22] Hagrid keeps the pieces of his wand in a pink umbrella, and performs small spells from time to time; however, he was technically forbidden to do magic until the third book, and since he is not a fully qualified wizard, he \\"will always be a bit inept\\" as compared to other adult wizards,[8] but \\"occasionally surprises everyone, himself included, by bringing off more impressive bits of magic\\".[23] However, he is unable to produce a Patronus.[24] He also has magical abilities that stem from his giant blood. For example, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, many of the stunning spells thrown at him by Ministry officials simply bounce off him. Also, being half-giant gives Hagrid some level of superhuman strength, which allowed him to bend the barrel of a shotgun with one hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrawp is the giant half-brother of Hagrid. Grawp and Hagrid were born of the same mother, the giantess Fridwulfa.[25] Grawp is about 16 feet (4.9?m) tall, which Hagrid claims is small for a giant. His knuckles are the size of cricket balls (~225?mm in circumference). The other giants were bullying Grawp, and this is a factor in Hagrids decision to bring him to the Forbidden Forest. Big and dim, he only knows a few words in English and his manners are wild and unpredictable, but he is also a child in giant years.  In the film, this is elaborated on more as he is visibly portrayed as a big, excitable child who simply doesn't know his own strength or developed proper social cues yet.  He responds to Hermione, who approaches him like a strict but caring mother figure, scolding him when doing something wrong, but giving him praise and playing with him when he does something good.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first, Grawp seems indifferent to his brothers attempts to civilise him, preferring to spend his time tearing down trees. After Hagrid leaves Hogwarts to avoid being imprisoned, he leaves Grawp in the care of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Much to their surprise, when they find themselves trapped in the forest during a confrontation with the local centaur population, Grawp inadvertently manages to divert the centaurs' attention from Harry and Hermione while looking for Hagrid, whom he calls 'Hagger'.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Half-Blood Prince, Grawp is moved to the mountains, where he is apparently progressing much better. He also attends Dumbledores funeral with Hagrid, much more civil and calm than before, and dressed formally. He also appears to understand emotions, at least to some extent, as he pats Hagrids head to comfort him. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Grawp, Hagrid, and Fang go into hiding after Hagrid throws a \\"Support Harry Potter\\" party and it is implied that Grawp helped them all escape. He is the only giant fighting against the Death Eaters in the Battle of Hogwarts, probably in an attempt to protect Hagrid, as he frequently calls his name while fighting the Death Eaters. Grawp participates in the victory celebration over Voldemorts defeat (albeit from a window, since he is too big to fit into the hall), and the Hogwarts students show their appreciation by tossing food into his laughing mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the film adaptation of the fifth book Grawp is computer-generated using a new \\"soul capturing\\" process from Image Metrics.[26] Andrew Whitehead spent 18 months working on the giant Grawp for the film.[27] The voice of Grawp is performed by Tony Maudsley.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Goblet of Fire, the truth about Hagrids parents is revealed: his father, who is never named in the stories, married a giantess, Fridwulfa. Fridwulfa left Rubeus to his fathers care after his birth; according to Hagrid, she was not very maternal. Later she gave birth to Grawp. She died long before Hagrid returned to the giants in the Order of the Phoenix. Hagrid describes his father as \\"a tiny little man\\" whom he could pick up with one hand and place on the dresser at the age of six. Hagrid clearly felt great affection for him; in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, he says that his fathers death when Hagrid was in third year at Hogwarts was one of his saddest memories.\\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid had a long-standing friendship with Dumbledore who became a sort of surrogate father to Hagrid after his father's death. It was Professor Dumbledore who stood up for Hagrid upon his expulsion and got him the job as gamekeeper and keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Hagrid, in turn, was a loyal friend to and agent for Dumbledore in various situations. Professor Dumbledore would recruit Hagrid as an agent of the Order of the Phoenix during both wizarding wars. Hagrid was also trusted by Dumbledore to rescue Harry from his parent's collapsing home upon their deaths and later was sent to retrieve Harry on his eleventh birthday, tell him of his wizarding identity and take him to Diagon Alley to purchase his supplies and equipment. Hagrid has been protective of Dumbledore and defended his honour against those who would speak badly about Dumbledore such as Vernon Dursley. Hagrid refers to Dumbledore as a \\"great man\\" and Dumbledore continued to help Hagrid and comfort him when he was in distress. Hagrid was stricken by grief when Dumbledore died and wept openly at the funeral services after having carried Dumbledore's body to where his tomb was to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid keeps and has kept a variety of pets, including some which the Wizarding community considers impossible to domesticate. They are not always wrong. Rowling has said that Hagrid has little interest in tamer magical creatures because of the lack of a challenge,[citation needed] although he has a large but cowardly boarhound named Fang. Hagrids love of dangerous magical creatures is central to the plot of several books of the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nAragog was an Acromantula, an enormous, sentient spider capable of speech, who made a unique clicking noise as he moved in search of prey. Hagrid raised Aragog from an egg as a Hogwarts student, keeping him inside a cupboard. In his third year at Hogwarts, Hagrid was caught talking to Aragog in the dungeons by Tom Riddle, who alleged that Aragog was the \\"Monster of Slytherin\\", and that Hagrid had opened the Chamber of Secrets. In fact, it was Riddle who had opened the Chamber, and the monster was actually a basilisk.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Hagrid's expulsion and assignment as gamekeeper, Aragog lived in the Forbidden Forest. Hagrid found him a mate, Mosag, with whom Aragog bore an entire colony of giant spiders. He remained grateful to Hagrid for his entire life, and kept his carnivorous children from attacking him when he came to visit (to bring him and his family food). This courtesy was not extended to other creatures and people, even when they were friends of Hagrid's; he allowed his children to attack Harry, Ron, and Fang when they encountered him in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Hagrid led him and Ron to Aragog by giving them the cryptic advice, \\"follow the spiders\\". An aging Aragog reveals to Harry and Ron of Hagrid's innocence and the discovery of a girl's corpse in the bathroom, before giving them a clue of the Chamber's resident monster; it was born in the castle, and his species never speak of the creature nor give its name, despite Hagrid's numerous inquiries as they fear it above all others. Though Aragog allowed his children to attack Harry, Ron, and Fang, they were saved at the last minute by Ron's father Arthur Weasleys flying car, which had been lost in the forest months before. Aragog remained in the Forbidden Forest for the rest of his life, but eventually died of old age in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Hagrid retrieved Aragogs body from the forest so that he could give him a proper burial, fearing that his children would devour his body. From that point on, the spider colony was the only part of the Forbidden Forest that Hagrid could not enter safely.\\r\\n\\r\\nAragogs children returned in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows during the Battle at Hogwarts; having been driven from the forest, they began attacking Death Eaters and Hogwarts' inhabitants indiscriminately. Hagrids love of the spiders endangered him and others because he tried to protect them; the spiders thanked Hagrid by capturing him and taking him to Voldemort. It is unknown what happens to them afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nAragog was voiced by Julian Glover in the film adaptation of the Chamber of Secrets. In 2017, in celebration of the 20th anniversary of \\"Harry Potter\\" franchise, arachnologists Anton A. Nadolny and Alireza Zamani named a new species of Iranian wolf spiders (Lycosidae) after Aragog, as Lycosa aragogi. The single specimen was collected on 26 April 2016, almost 19 years to the day after Aragog died (20 April 1997 in the world of the book).[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nBuckbeak, along with eleven other hippogriffs, is introduced during one of Hagrids Care of Magical Creatures classes. Hagrid explains that hippogriffs are very calm, powerful, proud creatures, but are sensitive and demand respect. Harry successfully approaches Buckbeak, who allows him to ride him around the paddock.\\r\\n\\r\\nDraco, in an arrogant attempt to show up his school nemesis, endeavours to approach Buckbeak as well. It becomes obvious that Draco neither listens to nor cares about Hagrid's warnings about the hippogriffs' sensitivity, as he makes contemptuous remarks about Buckbeak. Quickly angered, Buckbeak slashes Dracos arm with his claws. Pretending to be injured much more severely than he truly is, Draco persuades his father, Lucius Malfoy, to use his political power to sentence Buckbeak to death. Hagrids numerous appeals fail, and members of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures come to Hogwarts to execute Buckbeak. With the use of a Time-Turner, Hermione and Harry free Buckbeak (they believed him earlier to have been executed, but it was revealed the executioner only swung his axe into the fence in anger, in the film he does this to a pumpkin) and rescue Sirius from the tower in which he is being held before being handed over to the Dementors. Sirius escapes with Buckbeak and flies to safety. During most of Harrys fourth year, Sirius and Buckbeak hide in a cave in the mountains above Hogsmeade. After this, they move to Number 12 Grimmauld Place, whereupon Buckbeak stays in Sirius' mothers former room. When Kreacher wants to lure Sirius away briefly, he wounds Buckbeak.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Half-Blood Prince, Harry inherits Buckbeak, and allows Hagrid to look after him again. To avoid suspicion from the Ministry of Magic, he is given the alias \\"Witherwings\\". A fiercely loyal creature, Buckbeak chases Severus Snape away from Harry by slashing his claws at the end of the book. Buckbeak also features in the Battle of Hogwarts at the end of the Deathly Hallows leading the Hogwarts' Thestrals against Voldemorts giants.\\r\\n\\r\\nFang is a large boarhound (portrayed in the films by a Neapolitan Mastiff) that, aside from his enormous size, appears to be an entirely ordinary dog. While Fang's appearance is intimidating, he is, in Hagrid's words, \\"a bloody coward.\\" Boisterous and loving with people he knows, he seems to enjoy licking Harry, Ron, or Hermione around the face or ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Philosophers Stone he accompanies Harry, Hagrid, Draco, and Hermione into the Forbidden Forest to look for an injured unicorn. In the following book, the Chamber of Secrets, Harry and Ron take Fang into the forest where he is scared stiff of both the gigantic acromantula and Mr Weasleys flying car. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, an escaping Death Eater sets fire to Hagrids hut while Fang is inside; Hagrid enters the flaming hut, slings Fang over his shoulder, and carries him to safety. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Fang and Hagrid participate in the Battle of Hogwarts; though Fang's exact involvement is not clear. He is last seen running away after a shattered vase frightens him. It's implied that Fang survives, as Hagrid is not seen mourning him at any time. It's unknown if Fang is still alive when Harry's children come to Hogwarts.\\r\\n\\r\\nFluffy is a giant three-headed dog provided by Hagrid to guard the trapdoor leading to the underground chamber where the Philosopher's Stone was hidden until the end of Philosopher's Stone. The only known way to get past Fluffy is to lull him to sleep by playing music. Fluffy is based on Cerberus, the three-headed dog from Greek mythology that guards the gates to the underworld. As with Fluffy, Cerberus was lulled to sleep with music by Orpheus.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Philosophers Stone, Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville accidentally run into Fluffy whilst hiding from Peeves, who was attempting to give them away to caretaker Argus Filch, who was searching for them. On Halloween, Harry and Ron witness Snape entering the door to Fluffys chamber, and for the next few days having a pronounced limp. Harry also overhears him saying \\"How are you meant to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?\\" to Filch. However, it is later revealed that he followed then Hogwarts Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Quirinus Quirrell into the chamber. While Fluffy is guarding the Philosophers Stone, Professor Quirrell penetrates Fluffys defences by playing a harp, in order to access the trapdoor, while Harry uses a flute that had been given to him by Hagrid.\\r\\n\\r\\nJ. K. Rowling later revealed that Fluffy was repatriated to Greece by Dumbledore.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorbert is a Norwegian Ridgeback dragon that Hagrid had acquired as an egg from a mysterious, hooded stranger in the Hog's Head, who turned out to be Professor Quirrell. Hagrid helps the dragon hatch from the egg. Norbert becomes very dangerous and much bigger in the weeks following. Norbert bit Rons hand, causing him to require medical treatment due to the venom in her fangs.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione finally persuade Hagrid to send the dragon to Rons older brother Charlie, who is studying dragons in Romania. In the Deathly Hallows, Charlie reveals to Hagrid that \\"Norbert\\" is actually female and had been renamed Norberta. Charlie adds that female Norwegian Ridgeback dragons \\"are more vicious...\\" which explained Norbert's biting and dangerous behaviour as a baby.\\r\\n\\r\\nIGN listed Hagrid as their thirteenth top Harry Potter character, saying that Hagrid had become a surrogate for the audience and that the short scene in the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire film where he recollects memorable moments with Harry, Hermione and Ron gave them a \\"cherished memory\\".[31] IGNs Joe Utichi also listed Hagrid as his 7th favourite Harry Potter character.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid has appeared in various animated and non-animated parodies of Harry Potter. He was featured in US skit comedy Saturday Night Live, portrayed by Horatio Sanz, in the same episode in which Lindsay Lohan played Hermione.[33] In Alistair McGowan's Big Impression show, Hagrid appeared in a sketch called \\"Louis Potter and the Philosophers Scone\\", in which he was portrayed by Robbie Coltrane himself.[34] Hagrid is also parodied in Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan, a story released by Comic Relief in 2003, and he was played by Ronnie Corbett.[35][36] In the Potter Puppet Pals parodies by Neil Cicierega, Hagrid appeared in the episode \\"Ron's Disease\\", in which Harry uses Hagrids strength to cure Ron from an illness, as well as to beat Hermione and Snape, and to discover Dumbledores identity as a \\"gay android\\".[37] Hagrid also appears in the parody stage production Harry Potter and the Obnoxious Voice, interacting with Draco Malfoy and a dementor.[38] In one episode of the second series of Tracey Ullman's State of the Union, Tracey Ullman parodies Rowling as bossy and very keen on keeping her creations copyrighted, believing a hobo is impersonating Hagrid.","input":"What is the name of hagrid's spider?"},{"output":"from a drug overdose","context":"Kris Kross was an American hip hop duo formed in the early 1990s and consisting of Chris \\"Mac Daddy\\" Kelly and Chris \\"Daddy Mac\\" Smith.

The English, and later the British, were among the most important colonizers of the Americas, and their American empire came to rival the Spanish American colonies in military and economic might.\\r\\nThree types of colonies were established in the English overseas possessions in America of the 17th century and continued into the British Empire at the height of its power in the 18th century. These were charter colonies, proprietary colonies, and royal colonies. A group of 13 British American colonies collectively broke from the British Empire in the 1770s through a successful revolution, establishing the modern United States. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars (1803ÿ15), the remaining British territories in North America were slowly granted more responsible government. In 1838 the Durham Report recommended full responsible government for Canada, but this was not fully implemented for another decade. Eventually, with the Confederation of Canada, the Canadian colonies were granted significant autonomy and became a self-governing Dominion in 1867. Other colonies in the Americas followed at a much slower pace. In this way, two countries in North America, ten in the Caribbean, and one in South America have received their independence from Great Britain or the later United Kingdom. All of these, except the United States, are members of the Commonwealth of Nations and nine are Commonwealth realms. The eight current British overseas territories in the Americas have varying degrees of self-government.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of English colonies were established under a system of Proprietary Governors, who were appointed under mercantile charters to English joint stock companies to found and run settlements.\\r\\nIn 1664, England took over the Dutch colony of New Netherland (including its capital of New Amsterdam) which England renamed the Province of New York. With New Netherland, the English also came to control the former New Sweden (in what is now Delaware), which the Dutch had conquered earlier. This later became part of Pennsylvania after that was established in 1680.\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Scotland tried unsuccessfully to establish a colony at Darin, and the Scottish colonization of Nova Scotia (New Scotland) lasted from 1629 to 1632. Thousands of Scotsmen also participated in English colonization before the two countries were united in 1707.\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Great Britain acquired the French colony of Acadia in 1713 and then Canada and the Spanish colony of Florida in 1763. After being renamed the Province of Quebec, the former French Canada was divided into two Provinces, the Canadas, consisting of the old settled country of Lower Canada (today Quebec) and the newly settled Upper Canada (today Ontario).\\r\\nIn the north, the Hudson's Bay Company actively traded for fur with the indigenous peoples, and had competed with French, Aboriginal, and Mtis fur traders. The company came to control the entire drainage basin of Hudson Bay, called Rupert's Land. The small part of the Hudson Bay drainage south of the 49th parallel went to the United States in the Anglo-American Convention of 1818.\\r\\nThirteen of Great Britain's colonies rebelled in the American Revolutionary War, beginning in 1775, primarily over representation, local laws and tax issues, and established the United States of America, which was recognised internationally with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 3 September 1783.\\r\\nGreat Britain also colonised the west coast of North America, indirectly via the Hudson's Bay Company licenses west of the Rocky Mountains: the Columbia District and New Caledonia fur district. Most of these were jointly claimed as the Oregon Country by the United States from 1818 until the 49th parallel was established as the international boundary west of the Rockies by the Oregon Treaty of 1846. The Colony of Vancouver Island, founded in 1849, and the Colony of British Columbia, founded in 1858, were combined in 1866 under the name Colony of British Columbia, and joined the Confederation in 1871. British Columbia was expanded with the inclusion of the Stikine Territory in 1863; and upon joining Confederation the Peace River Block, formerly part of Rupert's Land, was added.\\r\\nIn 1867, the colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the Province of Canada (the southern portion of modern-day Ontario and Quebec) combined to form a self-governing dominion, named Canada, within the British Empire (the term \\"kingdom\\" was avoided so as to not provoke the United States). Quebec (including what is now the southern portion of Ontario) and Nova Scotia (including what is now New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island) had been ceded to Britain by the French. The colonies of Prince Edward Island and British Columbia joined over the next six years, and Newfoundland joined in 1949. Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory were ceded to Canada in 1870. This area now consists of the provinces of Manitoba (admitted after negotiation between Canada and a Mtis provisional government in 1870), Saskatchewan, and Alberta (both created in 1905), as well as the Northwest Territories, the Yukon Territory (created 1898, following the start of the Klondike Gold Rush), and Nunavut (created in 1999).\\r\\nIn order of settlement or founding:","input":"How did america become part of the british empire?"},{"output":"Third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics (i.e. cefotaxime, ceftriaxone)","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nNeisseria meningitidis, often referred to as meningococcus, is a Gram-negative bacterium that can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease such as meningococcemia, a life-threatening sepsis. The bacterium is referred to as a coccus because it is round, and more specifically, diplococcus because of its tendency to form pairs. About 10% of adults are carriers of the bacteria in their nasopharynx.[1] As an exclusively human pathogen it is the main cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults, causing developmental impairment and death in about 10% of cases. It causes the only form of bacterial meningitis known to occur epidemically, mainly Africa and Asia. It occurs worldwide in both epidemic  and endemic form.[2]\\r\\nN. meningitidis is spread through saliva and respiratory secretions during coughing, sneezing, kissing, chewing on toys and even through sharing a source of fresh water. It infects its host cells by sticking to them with long thin extensions called pili and the surface-exposed proteins Opa and Opc and has several virulence factors.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeningococcus can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease.[3] \\r\\nIt initially produces general symptoms like fatigue, fever, and headache and can rapidly progress to neck stiffness, coma and death in 10% of cases. Symptoms of meningococcal meningitis are easily confused with those caused by other bacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae.[4][5] Suspicion of meningitis is a medical emergency and immediate medical assessment is recommended. Current guidance in the United Kingdom is that if a case of meningococcal meningitis or septicaemia (infection of the blood) is suspected intravenous antibiotics should be given and the ill person admitted to the hospital.[6] This means that laboratory tests may be less likely to confirm the presence of Neisseria meningitidis as the antibiotics will dramatically lower the number of bacteria in the body. The UK guidance is based on the idea that the reduced ability to identify the bacteria is outweighed by reduced chance of death.\\r\\n\\r\\nSepticaemia caused by Neisseria meningitidis has received much less public attention than meningococcal meningitis even though septicaemia has been linked to infant deaths.[7]  Meningococcal septicaemia typically causes a purpuric rash, that does not lose its color when pressed with a glass (\\"non-blanching\\") and does not cause the classical symptoms of meningitis. This means the condition may be ignored by those not aware of the significance of the rash. Septicaemia carries an approximate 50% mortality rate over a few hours from initial onset.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther severe complications include WaterhouseÿFriderichsen syndrome, a massive, usually bilateral, hemorrhage into the adrenal glands caused by fulminant meningococcemia, adrenal insufficiency, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all instances of a purpura-like rash are due to meningococcal septicaemia; other possible causes, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP; a platelet disorder) and HenochÿSch?nlein purpura, also need prompt investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nN. meningitidis is a Gram-negative diplococcus since it has an outer and inner membranes with a thin layer of peptidoglycan in between. It is 0.6ÿ1.0 micrometers in size. It tests positive for the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nN. meningitidis is a part of the normal nonpathogenic flora in the nasopharynx of up to 5ÿ15% of adults.[9] It colonizes and infects only humans, and has never been isolated from other animals. This is thought to stem from the bacterium's inability to get iron sources other than human transferrin and lactoferrin.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nDisease-causing strains are classified according to the antigenic structure of their polysaccharide capsule.[10] Serotype distribution varies markedly around the world.[11]  Among the 13 identified capsular types of N. meningitidis, six (A, B, C, W135, X, and Y) account for most disease cases worldwide.[12] Type A has been the most prevalent in Africa and Asia, but is rare/practically absent in North America.  In the United States, serogroup B is the predominant cause of disease and mortality, followed by serogroup C. The multiple subtypes have hindered development of a universal vaccine for meningococcal disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nLipooligosaccharide (LOS) is a component of the outer membrane of N. meningitidis. This acts as an endotoxin and is responsible for septic shock and hemorrhage due to the destruction of red blood cells.[13] Other virulence factors include a polysaccharide capsule which prevents host phagocytosis and aids in evasion of the host immune response; fimbriae  mediate attachment of the bacterium to the epithelial cells of the nasopharynx.[14][15]  It infects the cell by sticking to it mainly with long thin extensions called pili and the surface-exposed proteins Opa and Opc.[16] Meningococci produce an IgA protease, an enzyme that cleaves IgA class antibodies and thus allows the bacteria to evade a subclass of the humoral immune system.\\r\\n\\r\\nA hypervirulent strain was discovered in China. Its impact is yet to be determined.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nFactor H binding protein (fHbp) that is exhibited in N. meningitidis and some commensal species is the main inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway. fHbp protects meningococci from complement-mediated death in human serum experiments, but has also been shown to protect meningococci from antimicrobial peptides in vitro. Factor H binding protein is key to the pathogenesis of N. meningitidis, and is, therefore, important as a potential vaccine candidate.[17]  Porins are also an important factor for complement inhibition for both pathogenic and commensal species. Porins are important for nutrient acquisition. Porins are also recognized by TLR2, they bind complement factors (C3b, C4b, factor H, and C4bp (complement factor 4b-binding protein)). Cooperation with pili for CR3-mediated internalization is another function of porins.  Ability to translocate into host cells and modulate reactive oxygen species production and apoptosis is made possible by porins, as well. Strains of the same species can express different porins.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least 8 complete genomes of Neisseria meningitidis strains have been determined which encode about 2,100 to 2,500 proteins.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genome of strain MC58 (serogroup B) has 2,272,351-base pairs. When sequenced in 2000, it was found to contain 2158 open reading frames (ORFs). Of these, a biological function was predicted for 1158 (53.7%). There were three major islands of horizontal DNA transfer found. Two encode proteins involved in pathogenicity. The third island only codes for hypothetical proteins. They also found more genes that undergo phase variation than any pathogen then known. Phase variation is a mechanism that helps the pathogen to evade the immune system of the host.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genome size of strain H44/76 is 2.18 Mb, and encodes 2,480 open reading frames (ORFs), compared to 2.27 Mb and 2,465 ORFs for MC58.[18] Both strains have a GC content of 51.5%.[18] A comparison with MC58 showed that four genes are uniquely present in H44/76 and nine genes are only present in MC58. Of all ORFs in H44/76, 2,317 (93%) show more than 99% sequence identity.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe complete genome sequence of strain NMA510612  (serogroup A) consists of one circular chromosome with a size of 2,188,020?bp, and the average GC content is 51.5%. The chromosome is predicted to possess 4 rRNA operons, 163 insertion elements (IS), 59 tRNAs, and 2,462 ORFs.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nGenetic transformation is the process by which a recipient bacterial cell takes up DNA from a neighboring cell and integrates this DNA into the recipients genome by recombination.  In N. meningitidis, DNA transformation requires the presence of short DNA sequences (9ÿ10 mers residing in coding regions) of the donor DNA.  These sequences are called DNA uptake sequences (DUSs).  Specific recognition of these sequences is mediated by a type IV pilin.[21]  In N. meningitidis DUSs occur at a significantly higher density in genes involved in DNA repair and recombination (as well as in restriction-modification and replication) than in other annotated gene groups. The over-representation of DUS in DNA repair and recombination genes may reflect the benefit of maintaining the integrity of the DNA repair and recombination machinery by preferentially taking up genome maintenance genes, that could replace their damaged counterparts in the recipient cell.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nN. meningititis colonizes the nasopharyngeal mucosa, which is rich in macrophages.  Upon their activation, macrophages produce superoxide (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Thus N. meningitidis is likely to encounter oxidative stress during its life cycle.[23]  Consequently, an important benefit of genetic transformation to N. meningitidis may be the maintenance of the recombination and repair machinery of the cell that removes oxidative DNA damages such as those caused by reactive oxygen. This is consistent with the more general idea that transformation benefits bacterial pathogens by facilitating repair of DNA damages produced by the oxidative defenses of the host during infection.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a fatality risk approaching 15% within 12 hours of infection, it is crucial to initiate testing as quickly as possible, but not to wait for the results before initiating antibiotic therapy.\\r\\n\\r\\nA small amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is sent to the laboratory as soon as possible for analysis. The diagnosis is suspected, when Gram-negative diplococci are seen on Gram stain of a centrifuged sample of CSF; sometimes they are located inside white blood cells. The microscopic identification takes around 1ÿ2 hours after specimen arrival in the laboratory.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gold standard of diagnosis is microbiological isolation of N. meningitidis by growth from a sterile body fluid, which could be CSF or blood.[5] Diagnosis is confirmed when the organism has grown, most often on a chocolate agar plate, but also on Thayer-Martin agar. To differentiate any bacterial growth from other species a small amount of a bacterial colony is tested for oxidase, catalase for which all clinically relevant Neisseria show a positive reaction, and the carbohydrates maltose, sucrose, and glucose, in which N. meningitidis will ferment that is, utilize the glucose and maltose. Finally, serology determines the subgroup of the N. meningitidis, which is important for epidemiological surveillance purposes; this may often only be done in specialized laboratories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above tests take a minimum of 48ÿ72 hours turnaround time for growing the organism, and up to a week more for serotyping. Growth can and often does fail, either because antibiotics have been given preemptively, or because specimens have been inappropriately transported, as the organism is extremely susceptible to antibiotics and fastidious in its temperature, CO2 and growth medium requirements.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests where available, mostly in industrialized countries, have been increasingly used; PCR can rapidly identify the organism, and works even after antibiotics have been given.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll recent contacts of the infected patient over the 7 days before onset should receive medication to prevent them from contracting the infection. This especially includes young children and their child caregivers or nursery-school contacts, as well as anyone who had direct exposure to the patient through kissing, sharing utensils, or medical interventions such as mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Anyone who frequently ate, slept or stayed at the patient's home during the 7 days before the onset of symptom, or those who sat beside the patient on an airplane flight or classroom for 8 hours or longer, should also receive chemoprophylaxis. The agent of choice is usually oral rifampicin for a few days.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nReceiving a dose of the Meningococcal vaccine before traveling to a country in the \\"meningitis belt\\" or having a booster meningitis vaccine, normally five years apart could prevent someone from getting an infection from the pathogen.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of vaccines are available in the U.S. to prevent meningococcal disease. Some of the vaccines cover serogroup B, while others cover A, C, W, and Y.[26] A meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) has been available since the 1970s and is the only meningococcal vaccine licensed for people older than 55. MPSV4 may be used in people 2ÿ55 years old if the MCV4 vaccines are not available or contraindicated. Two meningococcal conjugate vaccines (MCV4) are licensed for use in the U.S. The first conjugate vaccine was licensed in 2005, the second in 2010. Conjugate vaccines are the preferred vaccine for people 2 through 55 years of age. It is indicated in those with impaired immunity, such as nephrotic syndrome or splenectomy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes information about who should receive meningococcal vaccine.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a combination vaccine against two types of meningococcal diseases and Hib disease for infants and children 6 weeks to 18 months old. The vaccine, Menhibrix, was designed to prevent disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups C and Y, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). It was the first meningococcal vaccine that could be given to infants as young as six weeks old.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2014 the FDA approved the first vaccine effective against serogroup B,  named Trumenba, for use in 10- to 25-year-old individuals.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, the Meningitis Vaccine Project introduced a vaccine called MenAfriVac in the African meningitis belt. It was made by generic drug maker Serum Institute of India and cost 50 U.S. cents per injection. Beginning in Burkina Faso in 2010, it has been given to 215 million people across Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Togo and Gambia.[30] The vaccination campaign has resulted in near-elimination of serogroup A meningitis from the participating countries.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nPersons with confirmed N. meningitidis infection should be hospitalized immediately for treatment with antibiotics. Because meningococcal disease can disseminate very rapidly, a single dose of intramuscular antibiotic is often given at the earliest possible opportunity, even before hospitalization, if disease symptoms look suspicious enough.[5] Third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics (i.e. cefotaxime, ceftriaxone) should be used to treat a suspected or culture-proven meningococcal infection before antibiotic susceptibility results are available.[32] Empirical treatment should also be considered if a lumbar puncture, to collect CSF for laboratory testing, cannot be done within 30 minutes of admission to hospital.[33][34] Antibiotic treatment may affect the results of microbiology tests,  but a diagnosis may be made on the basis of blood-cultures and clinical examination.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nN. meningitidis is a major cause of illness, developmental impairment and death during childhood in industrialized countries and has been responsible for epidemics in Africa and in Asia. Every year, about 2,500 to 3,500 people become infected with N. meningitidis in the US, with a frequency of about 1 in 100,000. Children younger than 5 years are at greatest risk, followed by teenagers of high school age. Rates in the African meningitis belt were as high as 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 100[5] before introduction of a vaccine in 2010. The incidence of meningococcal disease is highest among infants (children younger than 1-year-old) whose immune system is relatively immature. In industrialized countries there is a second peak of incidence in young adults, who are congregating closely, living in dormitories or smoking.[36] Vaccine development is ongoing.[37]\\r\\nIt is spread through saliva and other respiratory secretions during coughing, sneezing, kissing, and chewing on toys. Inhalation of respiratory droplets from a carrier which may be someone who is themselves in the early stages of disease can transmit the bacteria. Close contact with a carrier is the predominant risk factor.  Other risk factors include a weakened general or local immune response, such as a recent upper respiratory infection, smoking, and complement deficiency. The incubation period is short, from 2 to 10 days. In susceptible individuals, N. meningitidis may invade the bloodstream and cause a systemic infection, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, breakdown of circulation, and septic shock.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1884 Ettore Marchiafava and Angelo Celli first observed the bacterium inside cells in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).[38] In 1887 Anton Weichselbaum isolated the bacterium from the CSF of patients with bacterial meningitis.[39]  He named the bacterium Diplococcus intracellularis meningitidis.[38]","input":"What kind of antibiotics are used for neisseria meningitidis?"},{"output":"233,836","context":"FargoÿMoorhead is a common name given to the metropolitan area comprising Fargo, North Dakota, Moorhead, Minnesota, and the surrounding communities.

A July 1, 2015 census estimate placed the population at 233,836,[1] an increase of 34% from the 2000 census.\\r\\nFargoÿMoorhead is the cultural, retail, health care, educational, and industrial center of southeastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the American Community Survey, the age distribution was as follows:\\r\\nAccording to the same survey, the racial composition was as follows:\\r\\nThere were 3,032 African Americans, who made up 1.6% of the population.\\r\\nThe Asian American population is not dominated by a single ancestry group, and is fairly diverse. The largest Asian American group are those of Chinese descent, who number at 928 and make up 0.5% of the population. Other sizable groups include Indians, Vietnamese, and Koreans, who number at 393, 379, and 360 respectively; all three groups comprise roughly 0.2% of the population. There are 134 Filipinos, making up roughly 0.1% of the population. People of Japanese descent were very few, with only 40 people identifying themselves as Japanese; they make up a mere 0.02% of the population.\\r\\nPacific Islander Americans numbered at 119, and made up approximately 0.06% of the population.\\r\\nMultiracial Americans make up 1.4% of the metro area's population. Those of white and Native American ancestry made up 0.5% of the population, and numbered at 938. People of white and Asian ancestry numbered at 557, and those of white and black ancestry numbered at 571. Both groupings made up roughly 0.3% of the population. Approximately 72 people identified themselves as black and Native American.\\r\\nHispanics and Latinos are the largest minority group in FargoÿMoorhead. Hispanics and Latinos make up 2.5% of the population, of which 2.0% are of Mexican descent. Of the 4,786 Hispanics, 3,846 are Mexican. There were 196 Puerto Ricans and 136 Cubans; both of these groups made up roughly 0.1% of the population. In addition, 608 individuals identified themselves with other Hispanic or Latino groups other than Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban, making up 0.3% of the population.\\r\\nThe Native American population is predominantly Ojibwe, with a Sioux minority. Of the 2,679 Native Americans, 1,447 are of the Chippewa tribal grouping. The Chippewa alone make up 0.8% of the population. The 444 Sioux make up 0.2% of the population. In addition, 20 people identified themselves as a member of the Cherokee tribal grouping.\\r\\nNOTE: The source above contains all of the information on population, age, and race.\\r\\nThe European American population is overwhelmingly German and Scandinavian. Most of the Scandinavian population is of Norwegian descent. Smaller Euro-American groups include those of English, Irish, and French descent.\\r\\nAs of the 2006ÿ2008 American Community Survey, the top ten largest European ancestry groups were the following:\\r\\nNOTE: The source above contains all of the information on ancestry and language.\\r\\nThe Census Bureau also tracks a FargoÿWahpeton Combined Statistical Area, consisting of Cass and Clay counties, as well as Richland County, North Dakota and Wilkin County, Minnesota. This area includes the twin cities of Wahpeton, North Dakota and Breckenridge, Minnesota. The FargoÿMoorhead urban core is actually about an hour's worth of highway travel from the WahpetonÿBreckenridge core. The main connection between these two pairs of cities is the Red River Valley, the flat, fertile land that both depend upon for a major part of their economies. Potatoes and sugar beets are important crops in the region, in addition to most of the other crops produced elsewhere in Minnesota and North Dakota.\\r\\nCoordinates: 4651N 9647W? / ?46.850N 96.783W? / 46.850; -96.783","input":"What is the population of the fargo moorhead area?"},{"output":"3 June 1787","context":"The First Fleet was the 11 ships that departed from Portsmouth, England, on 13 May 1787 to found the penal colony that became the first European settlement in Australia. The Fleet consisted of two Royal Navy vessels, three store ships and six convict transports, carrying between 1,000 and 1,500 convicts, marines, seamen, civil officers and free people (accounts differ on the numbers), and a large quantity of stores. From England, the Fleet sailed southwest to Rio de Janeiro, then east to Cape Town and via the Great Southern Ocean to Botany Bay, arriving over the period of 18 to 20 January 1788, taking 250 to 252 days from departure to final arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConvicts were originally transported to the Thirteen Colonies in North America, but after the American War of Independence ended in 1783, the newly formed United States refused to accept further convicts.[1] On 6 December 1785, Orders in Council were issued in London for the establishment of a penal colony in New South Wales, on land claimed for Britain by explorer James Cook in his first voyage to the Pacific in 1770.[2][3]\\r\\nThe First Fleet was commanded by Commodore Arthur Phillip, who was given instructions authorising him to make regulations and land grants in the colony.[4] The ships arrived at Botany Bay between 18 January and 20 January 1788:[5] HMS Supply arrived on 18 January, Alexander, Scarborough and Friendship arrived on 19 January, and the remaining ships on 20 January.[6][7]\\r\\nThe cost to Britain of outfitting and despatching the Fleet was S84,000[8] (about S9.6 million as of 2015).[9]\\r\\nThe First Fleet included two Royal Navy escort ships, the ten-gun sixth-rate vessel HMS?Sirius under the command of Captain John Hunter, and the armed tender HMS?Supply commanded by Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball.\\r\\nRopes, crockery, agricultural equipment and a miscellany of other stores were needed. Items transported included tools, agricultural implements, seeds, spirits, medical supplies, bandages, surgical instruments, handcuffs, leg irons and a prefabricated wooden frame for the colony's first Government House.[12] The party had to rely on its own provisions to survive until it could make use of local materials, assuming suitable supplies existed, and grow its own food and raise livestock.\\r\\nScale models of all the ships are on display at the Museum of Sydney. The models were built by ship makers Lynne and Laurie Hadley, after researching the original plans, drawings and British archives. The replicas of the Supply, Charlotte, Scarborough, Friendship, Prince of Wales, Lady Penrhyn, Borrowdale, Alexander, Sirius?(1786), Fishburn and Golden Grove are made from Western Red or Syrian Cedar.[13]\\r\\nNine Sydney harbour ferries built in the mid-1980s are named after First Fleet vessels. The unused names are Lady Penrhyn and Prince of Wales.\\r\\nThe people of the fleet included seamen, marines and their families, government officials, and a large number of convicts, including women and children. The majority were British, but there were also African, American and French convicts on board.[14][15] The convicts had committed a variety of crimes, including theft, perjury, fraud, assault, and robbery, for which they had variously been sentenced to penal transportation for 7 years, 14 years, or the term of their natural life.[16][17]\\r\\nThe six convict transports each had a detachment of marines on board. Most of the families of the marines traveled aboard the Prince of Wales.[18] A number of people on the First Fleet kept diaries and journals of their experiences, including the surgeons. There are twelve known journals in existence as well as some letters.[19]\\r\\nThe exact number of people directly associated with the First Fleet will likely never be established, as accounts of the event vary slightly. A total of 1,420 people have been identified as embarking on the First Fleet in 1787, and 1,373 are believed to have landed at Sydney Cove in January 1788. In her biographical dictionary of the First Fleet, Mollie Gillen gives the following statistics:[20]\\r\\nWhile the names of all crew members of Sirius and Supply are known, the six transports and three storeships may have carried as many as 110 more seamen than have been identified ÿ no complete musters have survived for these ships. The total number of persons embarking on the First Fleet would, therefore, be approximately 1,530 with about 1,483 reaching Sydney Cove.\\r\\nOther sources indicate that the passengers consisted of 10 civil officers, 212 marines, including officers, 28 wives and 17 children of the marines, 81 free people, 504 male convicts and 192 female convicts; making the total number of free people 348 and the total number of prisoners 696, coming to a grand total of 1,044 people.\\r\\nAccording to the first census of 1788 as reported by Governor Phillip to Lord Sydney, the white population of the colony was 1,030 and the colony also consisted of 7 horses, 29 sheep, 74 swine, 6 rabbits, and 7 cattle.[21]\\r\\nThe following statistics were provided by Governor Phillip:[22]\\r\\nDavid Collins' book An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales gives the following details:[23]\\r\\nThe Alexander, of 453 tons, had on board 192 male convicts; 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 29 privates, with 1 assistant surgeon to the colony.\\r\\nThe Scarborough, of 418 tons, had on board 205 male convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 26 privates, with 1 assistant surgeon to the colony.\\r\\nThe Charlotte, of 346 tons, had on board 89 male and 20 female convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 3 corporals, 1 drummer, and 35 privates, with the principal surgeon of the colony.\\r\\nThe Lady Penrhyn, of 338 tons, had on board 101 female convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, and 3 privates, with a person acting as a surgeon's mate.\\r\\nThe Prince of Wales, of 334 tons, had on board 2 male and 50 female convicts; 2 lieutenants, 3 sergeants, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 24 privates, with the surveyor-general of the colony.\\r\\nThe Friendship,  of 228 tons, had on board 76 male and 21 female convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 3 corporals, 1 drummer, and 36 privates, with 1 assistant surgeon to the colony.\\r\\nThere were on board, beside these, 28 women, 8 male and 6 female children, belonging to the soldiers of the detachment, together with 6 male and 7 female children belonging to the convicts.\\r\\nThe Fishburn store-ship was of 378 tons; the Borrowdale of 272 tons; and the Golden Grove of 331 tons. Golden Grove carried the chaplain for the colony, with his wife and a servant.\\r\\nNot only these store-ships, but the men of war and transports were laden with provisions, implements of agriculture, camp equipage, clothing for the convicts, baggage, etc.\\r\\nThe Sirius carried as supernumeraries, the major commandant of the corps of marines embarked in the transports* [*This officer was also lieutenant-governor of the colony], the adjutant and quarter-master, the judge-advocate of the settlement, and the commissary; with one sergeant, three drummers, seven privates, four women, and a few artificers.\\r\\nThe chief surgeon for the First Fleet, John White, reported a total of 48 deaths and 28 births during the voyage. The deaths during the voyage included one marine, one marine's wife, one marine's child, 36 male convicts, four female convicts, and five children of convicts.[24]\\r\\nThe First Fleet left Portsmouth, England on 13 May 1787.[25] The journey began with fine weather, and thus the convicts were allowed on deck.[26] The Fleet was accompanied by the armed frigate Hyena until it left English waters.[27] On 20 May 1787, one convict on the Scarborough reported a planned mutiny; those allegedly involved were flogged and two were transferred to Prince of Wales.[27] In general, however, most accounts of the voyage agree that the convicts were well behaved.[27] On 3 June 1787, the fleet anchored at Santa Cruz at Tenerife.[25] Here, fresh water, vegetables and meat were brought on board. Phillip and the chief officers were entertained by the local governor, while one convict tried unsuccessfully to escape.[28] On 10 June they set sail to cross the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro,[25] taking advantage of favourable trade winds and ocean currents.\\r\\nThe weather became increasingly hot and humid as the Fleet sailed through the tropics. Vermin, such as rats, and parasites such as bedbugs, lice, cockroaches and fleas, tormented the convicts, officers and marines. Bilges became foul and the smell, especially below the closed hatches, was over-powering.[29] While Phillip gave orders that the bilge-water was to be pumped out daily and the bilges cleaned, these orders were not followed on the Alexander and a number of convicts fell sick and died.[29] Tropical rainstorms meant that the convicts could not exercise on deck as they had no change of clothes and no method of drying wet clothing.[29] Consequently, they were kept below in the foul, cramped holds. On the female transports, promiscuity between the convicts, the crew and marines was rampant, despite punishments for some of the men involved.[29] In the doldrums, Phillip was forced to ration the water to three pints a day.[29]\\r\\nThe Fleet reached Rio de Janeiro on 5 August and stayed for a month.[25] The ships were cleaned and water taken on board, repairs were made, and Phillip ordered large quantities of food.[26] The women convicts' clothing had become infested with lice and was burnt. As additional clothing for the female convicts had not arrived before the Fleet left England,[26] the women were issued with new clothes made from rice sacks. While the convicts remained below deck, the officers explored the city and were entertained by its inhabitants.[30] A convict and a marine were punished for passing forged quarter-dollars made from old buckles and pewter spoons.\\r\\nThe Fleet left Rio de Janeiro on 4 September to run before the westerlies to the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa, which it reached on 13 October.[31] This was the last port of call, so the main task was to stock up on plants, seeds and livestock for their arrival in Australia.[32] The livestock taken on board from the Cape of Good Hope destined for the new colony included two bulls, seven cows, one stallion, three mares, 44 sheep, 32 pigs, four goats and \\"a very large quantity of poultry of every kind\\".[33] Women convicts on the Friendship were moved to other transports to make room for livestock purchased there. The convicts were provided with fresh beef and mutton, bread and vegetables, to build up their strength for the journey and maintain their health.[32] The Dutch colony of Cape Town was the last outpost of European settlement which the fleet members would see for years, perhaps for the rest of their lives. \\"Before them stretched the awesome, lonely void of the Indian and Southern Oceans, and beyond that lay nothing they could imagine.\\"[34]\\r\\nAssisted by the gales in the \\"Roaring Forties\\" latitudes below the 40th parallel, the heavily laden transports surged through the violent seas. In the last two months of the voyage, the Fleet faced challenging conditions, spending some days becalmed and on others covering significant distances; the Friendship travelled 166 miles one day, while a seaman was blown from the Prince of Wales at night and drowned.[35] Water was rationed as supplies ran low, and the supply of other goods including wine ran out altogether on some vessels.[35] Van Diemen's Land was sighted from the Friendship on 4 January 1788.[35] A freak storm struck as they began to head north around the island, damaging the sails and masts of some of the ships.\\r\\nOn 25 November, Phillip had transferred to the Supply. With Alexander, Friendship and Scarborough, the fastest ships in the Fleet, which were carrying most of the male convicts, the Supply hastened ahead to prepare for the arrival of the rest. Phillip intended to select a suitable location, find good water, clear the ground, and perhaps even have some huts and other structures built before the others arrived. This was a planned move, discussed by the Home Office and the Admiralty prior to the Fleet's departure.[36] However, this \\"flying squadron\\" reached Botany Bay only hours before the rest of the Fleet, so no preparatory work was possible.[37] Supply reached Botany Bay on 18 January 1788; the three fastest transports in the advance group arrived on 19 January; slower ships, including Sirius, arrived on 20 January.[38]\\r\\nThis was one of the world's greatest sea voyages ÿ eleven vessels carrying about 1,487 people and stores[33] had travelled for 252 days for more than 15,000 miles (24,000?km) without losing a ship. Forty-eight people died on the journey, a death rate of just over three per cent.\\r\\nIt was soon realised that Botany Bay did not live up to the glowing account that the explorer Captain James Cook had provided.[39] The bay was open and unprotected, the water was too shallow to allow the ships to anchor close to the shore, fresh water was scarce, and the soil was poor.[40] First contact was made with the local indigenous people, the Eora, who seemed curious but suspicious of the newcomers. The area was studded with enormously strong trees. When the convicts tried to cut them down, their tools broke and the tree trunks had to be blasted out of the ground with gunpowder. The primitive huts built for the officers and officials quickly collapsed in rainstorms. The marines had a habit of getting drunk and not guarding the convicts properly, whilst their commander, Major Robert Ross, drove Phillip to despair with his arrogant and lazy attitude. Crucially, Phillip worried that his fledgling colony was exposed to attack from Aborigines or foreign powers. Although his initial instructions were to establish the colony at Botany Bay, he was authorised to establish the colony elsewhere if necessary.[41]\\r\\nOn 21 January, Phillip and a party which included John Hunter, departed the Bay in three small boats to explore other bays to the north.[43] Phillip discovered that Port Jackson, about 12 kilometres to the north, was an excellent site for a colony with sheltered anchorages, fresh water and fertile soil.[43] Cook had seen and named the harbour, but had not entered it.[43] Phillip's impressions of the harbour were recorded in a letter he sent to England later: \\"the finest harbour in the world, in which a thousand sail of the line may ride in the most perfect security ...\\". The party returned to Botany Bay on 23 January.[43]\\r\\nOn the morning of 24 January, the party was startled when two French ships were seen just outside Botany Bay. This was a scientific expedition led by Jean-Fran?ois de La Prouse. The French had expected to find a thriving colony where they could repair ships and restock supplies, not a newly arrived fleet of convicts considerably more poorly provisioned than themselves.[44] There was some cordial contact between the French and British officers, but Phillip and La Prouse never met. The French ships remained until 10 March before setting sail on their return voyage. They were not seen again and were later discovered to have been shipwrecked off the coast of Vanikoro in the present-day Solomon Islands.[45]\\r\\nOn 26 January 1788, the Fleet weighed anchor and sailed to Port Jackson.[25] The site selected for the anchorage had deep water close to the shore, was sheltered, and had a small stream flowing into it. Phillip named it Sydney Cove, after Lord Sydney the British Home Secretary.[43] This date is celebrated as Australia Day, marking the beginning of British settlement.[46] The British flag was planted and formal possession taken. This was done by Phillip and some officers and marines from the Supply, with the remainder of Supply's crew and the convicts observing from on board ship. The remaining ships of the Fleet did not arrive at Sydney Cove until later that day.[47]\\r\\nThe First Fleet encountered indigenous Australians when they landed at Botany Bay. The Cadigal people of the Botany Bay area witnessed the Fleet arrive and six days later the two ships of French explorer La Prouse sailed into the bay.[48] When the Fleet moved to Sydney Cove seeking better conditions for establishing the colony, they encountered the Eora people, including the Bidjigal clan. A number of the First Fleet journals record encounters with Aboriginal people.[49]\\r\\nAlthough the official policy of the British Government was to establish friendly relations with Aboriginal people,[41] and Arthur Phillip ordered that the Aboriginal people should be well treated, it was not long before conflict began. The colonists did not sign treaties with the original inhabitants of the land.[50] Between 1790 and 1810, Pemulwuy of the Bidjigal clan led the local people in a series of attacks against the British colonisers.[51]\\r\\nThe ships of the First Fleet mostly did not remain in the colony. Some returned to England, while others left for other ports. Some remained at the service of the Governor of the colony for some months: some of these were sent to Norfolk Island where a second penal colony was established.\\r\\n1788\\r\\n1789\\r\\n1790:\\r\\nOn 26 January 1842, the Colonial Government in Sydney awarded a life pension of 1 shilling a day to three surviving members of the First Fleet. The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser reported, on Saturday 29 January 1842: \\"The Government have ordered a pension of one shilling per diem to be paid to the survivors of those who came by the first vessel into the Colony. The number of these really 'old hands' is now reduced to three, of whom, two are now in the Benevolent Asylum, and the other is a fine hale old fellow, who can do a day's work with more spirit than many of the young fellows lately arrived in the Colony.\\"[71] The names of the three recipients are not given.\\r\\nWilliam Hubbard: Hubbard was convicted in the Kingston Assizes in Surrey, England, on 24 March 1784 for theft.[72] He was transported to Australia on the Scarborough in the First Fleet. He married Mary Goulding on 19 December 1790 in Rose Hill. In 1803 he received a land grant of 70 acres at Mulgrave Place. He died on 18 May 1843 at the Sydney Benevolent Asylum. His age was given as 76 when he was buried at Christ Church St. Lawrence, Sydney on 22 May 1843.\\r\\nJohn McCarthy: McCarthy was a Marine who sailed on the Friendship.[73] McCarthy was born in Killarney, County Kerry, Ireland, circa Christmas 1745. He first served in the colony of New South Wales, then at Norfolk Island where he took up a land grant of 60 acres (Lot 110). He married the first fleet convict Ann Beardsley on Norfolk Island in November 1791 after his discharge a month earlier. In 1808, on the close of Norfolk Island settlement, he resettled in Van Diemen's Land and later took a land grant (80 acres at Melville) in lieu of the one forfeited on Norfolk Island. The last few years of his life were spent at the home of his granddaughter and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. William H. Budd, at a place called Kinlochewe Inn near Donnybrook, Victoria. McCarthy died on 24 July 1846,[74] six months past his 100 birthday.\\r\\nJohn Limeburner: The South Australian Register reported, in an article dated Wednesday 3 November 1847: \\"John Limeburner, the oldest colonist in Sydney, died in September last, at the advanced age of 104 years. He helped to pitch the first tent in Sydney, and remembered the first display of the British flag there, which was hoisted on a swamp oak-tree, then growing on a spot now occupied as the Water-Police Court. He was the last of those called the 'first-fleeters' (arrivals by the first convict ships) and, notwithstanding his great age, retained his faculties to the last.\\"[75] John Limeburner was a convict on the Charlotte. He was convicted on 9 July 1785 at New Sarum, Wiltshire of theft of a waistcoat, a shirt and stockings.[76] He married Elizabeth Ireland in 1790 at Rosehill and together they establish a 50-acre farm at Prospect.[77] He died at Ashfield in September 1847 and is buried at St John's, Ashfield.\\r\\nJohn Jones: Jones was a Marine on the First Fleet and sailed on the Alexander. He is listed in the N.S.W. 1828 Census as aged 82 and living at the Sydney Benevolent Asylum.[78] He is said to have died at the Benevolent Asylum in 1848.[79]\\r\\nSamuel King: King was a scribbler (a worker in a scribbling mill[80]) before he became a Marine. He was a Marine with the First Fleet on board the flagship Sirius?(1786).[81] He shipped to Norfolk Island on Golden Grove in September 1788, where he lived with Mary Rolt, a convict who arrived with the First Fleet on the Prince of Wales. He received a grant of 60 acres (Lot No. 13) at Cascade Stream in 1791. Mary Rolt returned to England on the Britannia in October 1796. King was resettled in Van Diemen's Land, boarding the City of Edinburgh on 3 September 1808, and landed in Hobart on 3 October.[82] He married Elizabeth Thackery on 28 January 1810. He died on 21 October 1849 at 86 years of age and was buried in the Wesleyan cemetery at Lawitta Road, Back River.\\r\\nJohn Small: Convicted 14 March 1785 at the Devon Lent Assizes held at Exeter for Robbery King's Highway. Sentenced to hang, reprieved to 7 years transportation. Arrived on the Charlotte in First Fleet 1788. Certificate of freedom 1792. Land Grant 1794, 30 acre \\"Small's Farm\\" at Eastern Farms (Ryde). Married October 1788 Mary Parker also a First Fleet convict who arrived on Lady Penrhyn. John Small died on 2 October 1850 at age of 90 years.[83][84]\\r\\nElizabeth Thackery: Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" King (ne Thackery) was tried and convicted of theft on 4 May 1786 at Manchester Quarter Sessions, and sentenced to seven years transportation. She sailed on the Friendship, but was transferred to the Charlotte at the Cape of Good Hope. She was shipped to Norfolk Island on the Sirius?(1786) in 1790 and lived there with James Dodding. In August 1800 she bought 10 acres of land from Samuel King at Cascade Stream. Elizabeth and James were relocated to Van Diemen's Land in December 1807[85] but parted company sometime afterwards. On 28 January 1810 Elizabeth married \\"First Fleeter\\" Private Samuel King (above) and lived with him until his death in 1849. Betty King died in New Norfolk, Tasmania on 7 August 1856, aged 89 years. She is buried in the churchyard of the Methodist Chapel, Lawitta Road, Back River, next to her husband, and the marked grave bears a First Fleet plaque. She was one of the first British women to land in Australia and was the last \\"First Fleeter\\" to die.\\r\\nHistorians have disagreed over whether those aboard the First Fleet were responsible for introducing smallpox to Australia's indigenous population, and if so, whether this was the consequence of deliberate action.\\r\\nIn 1914, J.?H.?L. Cumpston, director of the Australian Quarantine Service put forward the hypothesis that smallpox arrived with British settlers.[86] Some researchers have argued that any such release may have been a deliberate attempt to decimate the indigenous population.[87][88] Others have suggested that live smallpox virus may have been introduced accidentally, when Aboriginal people came into contact with variolous matter brought by the First Fleet for use in anti-smallpox inoculations.[89][90][91] Hypothetical scenarios for such an action might have included: an act of revenge by an aggrieved individual, a response to attacks by indigenous people,[92] or part of an orchestrated assault by the New South Wales Marine Corps, intended to clear the path for colonial expansion.[93][94]\\r\\nOther historians have disputed the idea that there was a deliberate release of smallpox virus and/or suggest that it arrived with visitors to Australia other than the First Fleet.[95][96][97][98][99] In 2002, historian Judy Campbell suggested that smallpox had arrived in Australia through contact with fishermen from Makassar in Indonesia, where smallpox was endemic.[97][100] In 2011, Macknight stated: The overwhelming probability must be that it [smallpox] was introduced, like the later epidemics, by [Indonesian] trepangers ... and spread across the continent to arrive in Sydney quite independently of the new settlement there.[101]\\r\\nThere is a third theory, that the 1789 epidemic was not smallpox but chickenpox ÿ to which indigenous Australians also had no inherited resistance ÿ that happened to be affecting, or was carried by, members of the First Fleet.[102][103] This theory has also been disputed.[104][105]\\r\\nAfter Ray Collins, a stonemason, completed years of research into the First Fleet, he sought approval from about nine councils to construct a commemorative garden in recognition of these immigrants. Liverpool Plains Shire Council was ultimately the only council to accept his offer to supply the materials and construct the garden free of charge. The site chosen was a disused caravan park on the banks of Quirindi Creek at Wallabadah, New South Wales. In September 2002 Collins commenced work on the project. Additional support was later provided by Neil McGarry in the form of some signs and the council contributed $28,000 for pathways and fencing. Collins hand-chiseled the names of all those who came to Australia on the eleven ships in 1788 on stone tablets along the garden pathways. The stories of those who arrived on the ships, their life, and first encounters with the Australian country are presented throughout the garden.[106] On 26 January 2005, the First Fleet Garden was opened as the major memorial to the First Fleet immigrants. Previously the only other specific memorial to the First Fleeters was an obelisk at Brighton-Le-Sands, New South Wales.[107] The surrounding area has a barbecue, tables, and amenities.","input":"When did the first fleet arrived in tenerife?"},{"output":"scheduling conflicts with some members of the cast","context":"Camelot is a 2011 historical-fantasy-drama television series which premiered on 1 April 2011.

Aided by her loyal maid Vivien and the devious nun Sybil, Morgan takes up residence in Uther's old castle, Castle Pendragon, from where she schemes against Arthur.\\r\\nIn October 2010, Camelot was the first series to get the green light from Starz since Chris Albrecht took over as President and CEO of the company.[17] With the announcement of plans for the series, Albrecht said that \\"The story of Arthur isn't history, it's mythology, and Camelot isn't a place but an idea of hope that has resonated at different times throughout history.\\"[17] Launched in January 2010, GK-TV is the television division of GK Films, headed by Oscar-winning producer Graham King and Tim Headington.[18] King called the series \\"a perfect choice as GK-TV's maiden project,\\" given the company's mandate for \\"producing compelling cinematic quality programming for television.\\"[17] The series idea is attributed to the U.K.'s Ecosse Films, and an \\"early incarnation\\" was set up at Showtime in 2008,[17] with that network announcing plans for the series in conjunction with BBC.[19]\\r\\nThe cast assembled at Ardmore Studios in Ireland in JuneÿJuly 2010 to begin \\"principal photography\\" for the series, which was created as an Irish-Canadian international co-production.[1] After the Ireland filming, post-production and visual effects took place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The cost was estimated at around $7 million per episode.[20] Starz retained U.S. rights, including digital and home entertainment distribution, Take 5 Productions owned distribution rights in Canada, and GK-TV for the rest of the world.[21]\\r\\nChris Chibnall, known for television series including Life on Mars and Torchwood, was showrunner and head writer for the show, which was engineered by Executive Producers Morgan O'Sullivan of Octagon in Ireland and John Weber of Take 5 Productions in Canada. Other executive producers included Academy Award-winner Graham King, Timothy Headington of GK Films, Craig Cegielski of GK-TV, James Flynn of Octagon, Douglas Rae of UK's Ecosse Films, Fred Fuchs, Michael Hirst and Anne Thomopoulos.[21] Chibnall was no newcomer to the legend of Camelot, having previously been in charge of developing a series about Merlin in 2005 for BBC. However, despite several scripts being written, BBC Head of Drama Jane Tranter eventually decided not to green-light the project,[22] although it later emerged, without Chibnall's involvement, as Merlin (2008ÿ2012). Executive producer Morgan O'Sullivan also had experience with the story through his involvement with the 2004 film King Arthur.[23]\\r\\nPublicity releases noted the series would consist of ten episodes that would \\"redefine the classic medieval tale of King Arthur.\\"[24] Advance descriptions of the series described it as having \\"sex, sword-fighting, magic, comedy\\".[25] According to a tongue-in-cheek comment by star Joseph Fiennes, it should be watched for another reason: \\"Because it's not a musical.\\"[25]\\r\\nHead writer Chris Chibnall stated that every era needs its own version of the story of Camelot[26] and that this version would include strong currents of politics and romance in an adult drama: \\"The amazing thing about Camelot is you can talk about political pursuits and it's all about the romance. It's all about the passion. It's all about great ideals compromised by falling in love with the wrong person.\\"[27] Chibnall also stated that the story had a special relevance for today's world because it dealt with the promise of world leaders to create a better world, and then trying to carry through on their promises.\\r\\nThe series used well-known stories and legends about King Arthur, including Le Morte d'Arthur[28] \\"but those only provided a starting point\\". The goal of the producers was to create episodes that \\"weave historical authenticity into a telling of the Arthur legends that is relatable to contemporary audiences\\".[21] The relationship between Merlin (Fiennes) and Arthur (Campbell Bower) was central to the show. Fiennes has joked that he thinks \\"of Merlin as a sort of cross between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Donald Rumsfeld,\\" referring to Kenobi's mentoring qualities and Rumsfeld's political agendas.[27] Fiennes described Merlin as a \\"...sort of tutor. He's a father figure. He's a brutal headmaster. He's got to give this boy all of the tools to be king in a ruthless world, and he has to do it in a very short space of time. So there's a lot of 'cruel to be kind.'\\"[27]\\r\\nWhile the first season was limited to ten episodes, the producers indicated that if the response to the show were strong, they had plans for \\"several additional seasons\\".[29] It was announced on 30 June 2011, that Camelot would not be returning for a second season and US network Starz had ruled out production for 2011.[30]\\r\\nStarz invested in a number of initiatives to promote the series, including the advance airing of the first episode (scheduled for normal broadcast on 1 April 2011) on 25 February 2011, following the series finale of that network's successful series, Spartacus: Gods of the Arena.[4][31] That episode, \\"Homecoming\\", was subsequently posted on the special series website created by Starz, where it could be streamed for home viewing.\\r\\nIn addition to a meeting with film critics to talk about the show,[27] individual interviews with the writer and a number of cast members[32] have been conducted, a Facebook page has been created, and many of the stars have been blogging[33] and tweeting[34] about the show's progress during and after the filming. Additionally, special short video trailers and behind-the-scenes video teasers were also posted online.[35] The upcoming series was also advertised online in a \\"Starz Originals\\" video, promoting both current and future original series.[36]\\r\\nStarz also released a poster showing Arthur and Morgan[37] and a series of promotional photos. In addition to the official promotions, fans created a website to include news and images of the upcoming series.[38]\\r\\nAdvance publicity for the series was positive, as evidenced by the comments of Maureen Ryan, who writes the \\"Stay Tuned\\" column for TVSquad.com.[39] Other critics were also comparing the series to the upcoming HBO series, Game of Thrones.[40] Critic James Hibberd refers to both shows as \\"swords 'n' sorcery epics\\", with a \\"quest for the kingship as the central storyline\\"?ÿ but adds the comment that there is no reason to choose one over the other, implying that viewers might be able to enjoy both.[40] Hibberd adds the one-word description, \\"fleshy\\", to describe the new Starz show.[40] One website used the phrase, \\"Starz makes Camelot sexy again.\\"[41] A critic for the Daily Inquirer wrote, \\"I watched the sneak preview and it looks like Starz has another hit on their hands\\",[42] and a New York Times article has called the series \\"An Arthur worthy of the modern ages.\\"[43] On the KFOG morning show Tim Goodman, The Hollywood Reporter's Chief Television Critic, called Camelot \\"a lightweight version of Game of Thrones\\" and \\"almost more like a guilty pleasure\\".[44][45]\\r\\nCamelot received a score of 58 on Metacritic. Negative reviews included Time magazine saying, \\"Even on the level of it's-just-entertainment, Camelot is exceedingly silly\\",[46] and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette saying, \\"it's a lot less graphic than Starz's ultra-sexy, ultra-violent Spartacus franchise. Dramatically, Camelot also pales in comparison. It's dull and talky and its first three episodes offer few surprises in storytelling.\\"[47]\\r\\nThe two-hour premiere was the highest-rated and most-watched premiere for an original series on Starz at that time. [48] The series was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award, a Saturn Award and additional award nominations internationally.","input":"Why was there only one season of camelot?"},{"output":"Richard Shannon Hoon","context":"Richard Shannon Hoon (September 26, 1967 ÿ October 21, 1995) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. He was the lead singer of the band Blind Melon until his death in 1995.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHoon was born in Lafayette, Indiana and raised in nearby Dayton, Indiana with his half-sister, Anna, and half-brother, Tim. He reportedly began using his middle name, Shannon, to avoid confusion with his father, who was also named Richard. In high school, he played football, wrestled, and was a pole vaulter. Shannon's musical influences included the Grateful Dead, The Beatles, John Lennon, and Bob Dylan. After graduating from McCutcheon High School in 1985, Hoon joined a local glam metal band named Styff Kytten, which also featured guitarist Michael Kelsey. He took on the role of frontman and lead singer of the band. It was around this time that he wrote his first song and called it \\"Change.\\" He was also a member of the Lafayette band Mank Rage, along with David Lank and Darren Mickler, during this time.\\r\\nIn 1985, Hoon, 18, left Indiana for Los Angeles.[3] In Los Angeles, he met musicians Brad Smith and Rogers Stevens at a party. Smith and Stevens saw Hoon perform his song \\"Change\\" acoustically and invited Hoon to play with them. Christopher Thorn and Glen Graham were then brought into the fold, and by 1990 the five musicians decided to form Blind Melon. The band was possibly named for a term Smith's father used to describe the neighborhood stoners; or for Blind Melon Chitlin, a character from a Cheech & Chong album.[contradictory] In 1990, the new bandmates produced a four-song demo tape and subsequently signed a $500,000 recording contract with Capitol Records.\\r\\nIn Los Angeles, Hoon befriended his sister Anna's high school friend, Axl Rose. Rose invited Hoon to join him in the studio, where his band Guns N' Roses were recording their albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (both released in 1991). Hoon sang backing vocals on several of the tracks, including \\"The Garden\\" and \\"Don't Cry.\\" Rose also invited Hoon to appear in the video for \\"Don't Cry.\\"\\r\\nIn 1992, Blind Melon released their self-titled debut album produced by Pearl Jam producer Rick Parashar. Blind Melon began touring to promote the album, supporting and opening for acts like Ozzy Osbourne, Guns N' Roses, and Soundgarden over the course of 1992ÿ1993. In the summer of 1992, the video for the album track \\"No Rain\\" was released as a single. The video for \\"No Rain\\" focused on a theme of the \\"normal\\" crowd versus the lonely outcast. It featured a young girl, played by Heather DeLoach, in a bee costume, tap dancing to unappreciative audiences, who finally finds an entire crowd of people similarly dressed who welcome her. The video is often referred to as the 'Bee Girl'. Blind Melon went multi-platinum.\\r\\nHoon and Blind Melon spent the next two years touring. In 1993, Hoon was arrested for indecent exposure after he disrobed onstage and urinated on a fan at a show in Vancouver.[4]\\r\\nIn 1994, Blind Melon appeared at Woodstock '94 where Hoon, allegedly high on LSD, went onstage wearing his girlfriend's white dress.[5]\\r\\nAfter taking a hiatus from touring, Blind Melon returned to the studio to record the album Soup in New Orleans. Soup was released in 1995.\\r\\nOn July 11, 1995, Hoon and his girlfriend, Lisa Crouse, had a daughter named Nico Blue.[6] Before the birth of his daughter, Hoon entered rehab again. In August, Blind Melon planned to tour to support their album Soup, so Hoon allowed a drug counselor to accompany him on the road.[7] The counselor, unable to keep Hoon from relapsing, was dismissed days before Hoon's death.\\r\\nAfter a disappointing performance in Houston on October 20, Hoon launched himself into an all-night drug binge.[7] The next day, Saturday, October 21, 1995, Blind Melon was scheduled to play a show in New Orleans at Tipitina's. The band's sound engineer, Lyle Eaves, went to the tour bus to awaken Hoon for a sound check, but Hoon was unresponsive. An ambulance arrived, and Hoon was pronounced dead at the scene, at the age of 28.[8] The cause of death was attributed to a cocaine overdose.\\r\\nHoon was buried at Dayton Cemetery in Dayton, Indiana. His grave is inscribed with a line from Blind Melon's song \\"Change\\", the first song he wrote:\\r\\nSo I want to write my words on the face of today and they'll paint it\\r\\nOn November 12, 1996, Blind Melon released their final album featuring Hoon, Nico, as a tribute to him with all proceeds going to his daughter and to programs helping musicians deal with drug problems. The band also released a video called Letters From A Porcupine that was nominated for 'Best Long Form Music Video' at the Grammy Awards on February 25, 1997.\\r\\nOn September 17, 2008, the book A Devil on One Shoulder and an Angel on the Other: The Story of Shannon Hoon and Blind Melon by Greg Prato was published.[9]","input":"Who was the lead singer for blind melon?"},{"output":"February 6, 2005","context":"American Dad! is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker, and Matt Weitzman for the Fox Broadcasting Company.[2][3] American Dad! is the first television series to have its inception on Animation Domination.[4] The series premiere aired on February 6, 2005, following Super Bowl XXXIX, three months before the rest of the first season aired as part of the Animation Domination block, commencing on May 1, 2005. [5][6]\\r\\nCreative direction of American Dad! has largely been guided by Barker (prior to his exit from the show in season 10) and Weitzman as opposed to MacFarlane, resulting in a series that is different from its counterparts.[7] Unlike its sister shows, Family Guy and The Cleveland Show, American Dad! does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags, and is less concerned with conventional \\"setup-punchline\\" jokes,[3] instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters, the relationships between family members, and the relatively relatable plots. The show is not as heavy on pop cultural allusions as MacFarlane's Family Guy, and is more concerned with telling stories while maintaining the integrity and realism of the family members.[2] While the core issues and resolutions are relatable in most episodes, the show nonetheless weaves in fantastical elements, pitching the tone of the show somewhere between observational comedy and farce.[8] The plots are often absurd, but they are grounded by family stories and real-world issues.[9]\\r\\nAmerican Dad! has been nominated for numerous awards, most prominently three Primetime Emmy Awards and two Annie Awards. In June 2013, it was awarded as top television series by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. Since its debut, American Dad! has broadcast 234 episodes (September 2017). The total number of seasons and organization of episodes within these seasons are in dispute because of a discrepancy in how official sources report this information. One model suggests the first season of American Dad! comprises the first 7 episodes, while another model suggests the first season comprises 23 episodes.[10]\\r\\nTBS picked up the series for the 12th season following the final 3 episodes airing on Fox as the 11th season. American Dad!'s TBS run began on October 20, 2014. TBS has also renewed the series for a 22-episode as 13th season, which premiered on January 25, 2016.[11][12] On August 27, 2015, TBS announced it had picked up American Dad! for a 14th and 15th season of 22 episodes each.[13] The 14th season premiered on November 7, 2016.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series focuses on the eccentric upper middle class Smith family in the fictional community of Langley Falls, Virginia and their three housemates:[3] Father, husband, CIA Agent, Republican, and breadwinner Stan; his wife and homemaker/housewife, Francine; their liberal, hippie, college-aged daughter, Hayley; and their dorky high-school-aged son, Steve. There are three additional main characters, including Hayley's boyfriend/husband, Jeff Fischer; the family's unusual goldfish, Klaus, who has the mind of an East German athlete; and Roger, the alien, who is a deceitful, self-serving master of disguise.[15][16] Stan's boss Avery Bullock, the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, is a recurring character.\\r\\nThe voice actors are not assembled as a group when performing the lines of their characters; rather, each of the voice actors perform their lines privately. The voice actors have stated that because of their personalities and tendency to goof off when together as a group, they would never get anything completed if they performed their lines collectively.[17]\\r\\nAmerican Dad! centers on the absurd circumstances, adventures and domestic life of its title character Stan Smith, his immediate family, and their three housemates. Adding to all the ridiculousness and absurdity are the various personality traits of all the show's eccentric main characters, listed as follows:\\r\\nWhen asked what first spurred the idea for American Dad! Seth MacFarlane answered, \\"It was right after the [2000] election, and me [sic] and co-creator Matt Weitzman were so frustrated with the Bush administration that we would just spend days bitching and complaining, and we figured we should channel this into something creative and hopefully profitable.\\"[7][10] In early February 2005, Barker stated, \\"About a year and a half ago, Seth called and asked if Matt and I would be interested in working on a show about a right-wing CIA agent and his liberal daughter. It was right up our alley, and everything just fell into place.\\"[5][10][18] On September 14, 2003, Variety reported that Fox Broadcasting had ordered a pilot presentation of the then tentatively titled American Dad! and \\"If greenlit, American Dad! could launch as early as fall 2004.\\" At the time, Fox was aiming to develop a new lineup of adult animated sitcoms.[19]\\r\\nAmerican Dad! had a mid-season debut. Its first episode, titled \\"Pilot\\", was originally shown directly following Super Bowl XXXIX on February 6, 2005. The rest of the first season, however, would not launch until May 1, 2005, on Fox's Animation Domination lineup which had its debut on that date.[6][9][20] Initially, it was a replacement for the originally failed series Family Guy (1999ÿ2003). American Dad! was originally intended to be Fox's answer to the hordes of fans left behind from the original failure of MacFarlane's previous animated venture.[2] Just three short months after American Dad!'s debut however, Family Guy was revived, leaving American Dad! with a formidable expectation: whether the series could distinguish itself from its counterpart and succeed on its own merits.[2] Instead of taking over creative direction of the series, MacFarlane left the job largely in the hands of Barker and Weitzman so as to distinguish American Dad![7]\\r\\nIn its early going, American Dad! brought in strong ratings but fought an uphill battle in gaining widespread acceptance and approval from viewers and critics alike.[10] The popularity of MacFarlane and his involvement with Family Guy have led to foregone conclusions and prejudices against American Dad! as a rip-off of the predecessor[10] and some critics had already written off American Dad! prior to its birth as nothing more than a pale imitation of Family Guy and MacFarlane's attempts to get his old show back on the air.[9] One example, prior to the American Dad! series debut, a writer of The Washington Post published a piece that reads \\"But those same executives have also given MacFarlane a whole new animated half-hour to play with in the disappointing American Dad! The new series officially premieres in May but has a sneak preview tomorrow night in the coveted post-Super Bowl time period?... The look and pace of American Dad! is the same as Family Guy.\\"[21]\\r\\nIn actuality, however, the program's beginnings take cues from the TV series All in the Family, almost a farcical animated version of the live action sitcom.[22][23] Both shows make use of political satire, bigotry, ludicrous expressions of Conservatism from their paternal main character (Stan likened to Archie Bunker), and sensible expressions of Liberalism from their daughter character (Hayley likened to Gloria Stivic). Moreover, the daughter in both series each have a Liberal hippie boyfriend turned husband (Jeff likened to Michael Stivic) of whom the daughter's Conservative father is antagonistic towards. Also in both, the daughter lives in her parents' home with her boyfriend turned husband as a housemate. American Dad! in its original form was even said to have been inspired by All in the Family.[22][24]\\r\\nIn American Dad!'s initial seasons MacFarlane was described as focusing more attention on his coexisting obligation of Family Guy. This was to the extent that American Dad! was completely secondary to him, and he did not understand the show. Because he was not getting the show at the time, he was described as \\"just going along for the ride.\\" Likewise, the rest of the show's creators Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman were also trying to figure out the show and where it was going.[9][10]\\r\\nAfter American Dad!'s initial couple of seasons and as it progressed, the show began to increasingly develop its very own distinct approach and identity, becoming more and more distinguished from all other programs on the air. Standing out from its counterparts increasingly with each passing season, the series has been described as eventually becoming the weirdest show in network prime time. It has been characterized as serving up distinguishing blasts of surrealism.[9] As the series progressed, MacFarlane realized that Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman were on to something uniquely appealing; moreover, he realized they were on to something that sharply contrasted from Family Guy, which audiences appreciated.[9][10]\\r\\nAfter the show's first several seasons, MacFarlane not only came to fully understand and appreciate American Dad!'s value but also came to consider himself a huge fan of the series. Taking note of his Twitter followers increased fanaticism and excitement over American Dad! and the \\"Roger\\" character, MacFarlane began putting considerable amounts of his time and efforts into the series, more so in the last several seasons than ever before (this observation made in fall 2012).[9] In describing American Dad! comedy styles, Barker noted that it is not as reference-laden as Family Guy or South Park. He added that American Dad!'s humor more frequently derives from \\"the human condition and emotions that everyone can relate to: ego, the feds, etc. And for that reason, I think our humor is a little more evergreen.\\"[25]\\r\\nOn developing scripts for American Dad! episodes, co-creator Mike Barker revealed that he and the rest of the show's staff never know when and from where plot line ideas will emerge. \\"Just as an example,\\" Barker explained, \\"All About Steve\\" is an episode where Stan wants his son to be more of a jock and more like he was when he was his age. That whole episode came about from one of our writers Dave Hemingson coming into our office, telling us he just visited the dentist and he may need to get braces. And the idea of a grown man with braces appealed to us, and we just decided what if we put Stan in braces, and he understands for the first time what it's like to feel like a geek.\\"[26]\\r\\nDuring the 2012ÿ13 season, Barker revealed that much of his inspiration for American Dad! plots has come through listening to music. Barker's revelation to use music as a muse for his American Dad! writing came from attending the 2008 Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival. During that event, he watched the rock band My Morning Jacket perform a four-hour set in the rain and realized from the experience that he could generate ideas for American Dad! by tapping into music: \\"From that point on, I realized that music should be playing a bigger role in my writing\\", Barker told the Louisville Courier-Journal. \\"Writing is hard for me, and when you hear music that inspires good ideas, you're really grateful.\\"[27] The Beginning of the show's main theme \\"Good Morning USA\\" uses the beginning introduction to \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\".\\r\\nIn particular, Barker has credited music from Wax Fang for his inspiration in writing certain American Dad! plots. Said Barker, \\"There's just something so inherently cinematic about Wax Fang's music. [Scott] Carney's voice is stunningly clear and dramatic. And his lyrics are specific enough to build stories around while staying flexible enough for different interpretations.\\" Barker added that through listening to the Wax Fang track Majestic, he was able to come up with major plot elements for the episode \\"Lost in Space\\" (this episode features the Wax Fang songs Majestic and At Sea).[28]\\r\\nBarker has stated that once he and the rest of the show's staff get the idea for the plot line, they spend a couple of weeks in a room with all the screenwriters. There, they break the story and make sure that each act of the two act breaks are strong. As another procedure, Barker stated that they make a point of twisting the story in such a way so as to make audiences come back for more after the commercial break.[26]\\r\\n\\"The final process,\\" Barker explained, \\"is sending a screenwriter out to write the script. The screenwriter gets two weeks to write the script. The script then comes back.\\" Barker explained that they then all edit and rewrite it, \\"hopefully keeping as much of the first draft as we can and punching the jokes and making sure all the motivations are there, and then we take it to the table and read it.\\"[26]\\r\\nIn February 2005, Barker stated that as creative directors, all decisions made about the plot line and direction of the series go through himself and Weitzman. He explained that the show had reflected their point of view since the beginning. Barker has also credited the program's other staff beyond himself, Weitzman, and MacFarlane, remarking \\"We couldn't have made it all happen without them.\\" At the time, it was noted that the series had a staff of 17 writers, which was described as \\"a big undertaking.\\"[22]\\r\\nWhen Barker was asked what his favorite part was of the American Dad! pre-production process, he answered, \\"I like the story breaking process, personallycoming up with the stories. To me, that's the most gratifying.\\"[26]\\r\\nBarker and Matt Weitzman have stated that they are accustomed to feeling scruples with adding certain material into the plots, but always follow this up by going ahead with incorporating the material anyway. They added that their goal is to create laughs combined with groans and going over the line.[29]\\r\\nMacFarlane played a lead role in the animated character designs for American Dad!.[22]\\r\\nIn describing the characters' appearances, Weitzman remarked \\"It's all very bright, very easy on the eyes.\\"[5][18]\\r\\nIn explaining the animated side of the job, Barker stated, \\"Fifty or so animators from the Fox animation group are involved. A lot is done in-house: poses, models, props, all storyboards and timing.\\"[22]\\r\\nAlso as reported in February 2005, animation for American Dad! is colored and detailed overseas. Sunwoo Entertainment of Korea was said to handle that end of the pre-production process.[22]\\r\\nBarker has explained that because American Dad! creators are working in animation as opposed to live action, they have the ability to redraw and rewrite up until the show is aired.\\r\\nHowever, Barker has also stated, \\"It's really hard to accept anything less than perfect when you start to get wrapped up in this process of being able to constantly make changes. Eventually you have to kind of bring down the hammer at the color stage and live with what you've got.\\"\\r\\nBarker has explained that, ultimately, the creation process of an American Dad! episode is completed upon the producers' say-so, not anyone else's.[26]\\r\\nWhen American Dad! co-creator Matt Weitzman was asked what his favorite part was of the show's pre-production process, he answered, \\"I probably enjoy the editing process a lot. I think I like the fine tuning of things and making things happen just so. Making the episode just kind of pop in its own subtle ways.\\"[26]\\r\\nAmerican Dad! creators have revealed to working significantly in advance of newly broadcast episodes. As many as 20 to 42 unaired episodes are typically ready for finishing touches. Barker explained that a key to this system is making sure that the writing is timeless, as opposed to topical and contemporary. He added that if any material within the script deals with contemporary issues, the creators have to hope that they're also contemporary issues two years down the line. When asked whether or not this method has ever brought on difficulties, Barker answered in the affirmative and explained:\\r\\nIn discussing the creation of American Dad! and animated sitcoms in general, MacFarlane has stated:\\r\\nConversely, Barker has stated:\\r\\nThe Smith family and their two housemates reside on Cherry Street in the fictional suburb of Langley Falls, Virginia.[30] It is worth noting that there is an actual Langley, Virginia (home to the headquarters of the CIA, which is where Stan works in the series) and a Great Falls, Virginia, both communities located in Fairfax County, Virginia. The Smiths and their two housemates live in a large, two-story residence with a basement and an attic. In addition, the Smith house is apparently enhanced with numerous secret rooms, facilities, and large habitats, these unorthodox attachments usually only seen once for each (i.e., the episodes \\"Of Ice and Men\\", \\"Bush Comes to Dinner\\", \\"The Missing Kink\\", \\"The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith\\", etc.).[31] The house is also shown to be filled with many pitfall traps, one of which is filled with alligators and another named by Stan as the \\"Pit of No Return.\\"[32][33] Greg and Terry are a gay couple that live across the street from the Smiths. Within the neighborhood, they are portrayed as running a neater and tidier home than the Smiths. Greg and Terry are also the local news anchor for W-ANG-TV. Also in the area is the high school attended by Steve, Pearl Bailey High School.[34]\\r\\nAmerican Dad! has commonly made use of farces as most of the predicaments that befall the main characters have escalated into the extremes, to the point of getting outrageously out-of-hand.[3][35][36] For example, in the episode \\"Home Wrecker\\", Stan and Francine's marital harmony breaks down from a difference of opinion on remodeling the house. It gets to the point where they divide the house in two, each decorating their half of the house in their desired fashion. Not satisfied with this however, they both attempt to drive the other out of the home and eventually erect a colossal block wall, dividing the two halves of the house. The rest of the family members are forced to spend one holiday after the next alternating between Fran's and Stan's place (the sides of the house treated as distinct homes). As another example, in the episode \\"Stan's Food Restaurant\\", Stan asks for Roger's help in starting a restaurant. As things progress, Roger makes heavy changes in the layout, eventually kicking Stan out of the project. Stan retaliates by opening another restaurant next door, which becomes a smashing success. Roger responds by blowing up Stan's restaurant but destroying his own in the process. Stan threatens to kill Roger, but backs down after Roger pulls a gun on him and tells him to relax.[36]\\r\\nAmerican Dad! plots are generally teeming with surrealism and nonsensical elements.[37] Many of the occurrences, circumstances, and behaviors are unrestrainedly preposterous, senseless, and illogical.[3][38]\\r\\nAs further examples of surrealism on American Dad!in the episode \\"Hurricane!\\", a ferocious bear pauses in his attack, lowers his eyelids halfway, and repeatedly shakes his head horizontally, shaming Stan for missing him in a harpoon shot and instead spearing Francine into a wall; in the episode \\"Why Can't We Be Friends?\\", the hallways of the Smith house transform into dark and dangerous ghetto alleyways for every time Roger ambushed, stole money from, and even tried to forcibly rape Jeff Fischer;[39] in the episode \\"The Missing Kink\\", Steve and family fish Klaus are shown competing in a one-on-one basketball game between each other, the score nearly tied at 11 to 10; also in the \\"Missing Kink\\" episode, the Smith house is shown to consist of a never-before-seen underworld to which various friends and acquaintances of the Smiths party and frolic; in the episode \\"The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith\\", Stan has a never-before-seen secret control room hidden underground just beside the house. The control room door's exterior side is camouflaged with the grass surrounding it. The room is filled with highly advanced, state-of-the-art equipment. Access to the control room is achieved through a handprint reading device that extends from the ground when Stan extends his arm/hand at it; etc.[37][38]\\r\\nAmong one of the many forms of surreal humor and nonsense elements that have been used by American Dad! is the non sequitur. This arises when the show's focus becomes sidetracked by entirely unknown and unrelated characters in circumstances that are irrelevant to the episode's main plot. Typically when this happens, it is after the show has maintained focus on its main characters for much of the episode; following this, the scenes randomly lose focus and become deeply wrapped up into the lives of never-before-seen characters who are non-central to the plot. A prime example of this is in the episode \\"Homeland Insecurity\\". As opposed to scenes focusing on main characters, attention is redirected deep into the lives of unknown characters who gain possession of Roger's transforming feces turned gold. As another example, in the episode \\"The Missing Kink\\", the show's focus is sporadically sidetracked with brief scenes revolving around the life of a drug abusing bird and Francine's inexplicable ability to both understand and communicate with the bird's chirping.[37][40]\\r\\nThe series has abounded with random, unexpected occurrences and surprise plot twists as result of the characters and the very makeup of the program.[41] For example, in the episode \\"The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith\\", Steve refers to Roger for help in dealing with a school bully. Because Steve is able to correctly predict Roger's original game plan of handling the situation himself under an alter ego, Roger throws him a curveball: he not only hires someone else, Stelio Kontos (from the episode \\"Bully for Steve\\"), to handle the matter but hires him to bully Steve in combination with Steve's original bully. As another example, in the episode \\"The Vacation Goo\\", Francine becomes frustrated that she cannot get the family together for Sunday night dinner. For family time, Stan suggests a vacation, and the Smiths have a great time in Maui as a family. This is up until Roger shuts down the mechanism Francine and the kids are all attached to so as to believe they are all on vacation. Francine and the kids then learn that Stan has been programming a pseudo-vacation every year in a contraption dubbed \\"the goo chambers\\". After learning of this, Francine demands they go on a real vacation. Twice they appear to do so, first skiing, then to Italy, until it is ultimately revealed that they are in the \\"goo chambers\\" all along, with Steve and then Hayley having programmed the vacations, respectively. In the episode \\"Spelling Bee My Baby\\", Steve deliberately misspells his words in a spelling bee so as to express his love for Akiko (who is also competing), instead spelling random Tyler Perry/Madea films.[41]\\r\\nAnother technique used by American Dad! is the story arc. On several occasions, a circumstance expands and progresses across a collection of episodes.[3][18] As an example, one of Hayley's temporary breakups with Jeff expanded across a string of episodes, in which she instead temporarily dated a black man in a koala body, Reginald Koalaknown for his very urban mannerisms and behaviors. As another example, since the 9th season episode \\"Naked to the Limit, One More Time\\", Jeff Fischer has been absent from the Smith house and planet Earth altogether. In that episode, Jeff is blindsided when Roger hurls him into a spaceship. This spacecraft belongs to Roger's race of aliens and was intended to return him back to his birth planet; however, Roger remains behind after casting Jeff into the spaceship. The spaceship immediately takes off and Jeff is not seen until several episodes later, the episode \\"Lost in Space\\". During episodes that aired between the two aforementioned episodes, allusions to the ongoing plot line are made. For example, in the episode \\"Spelling Bee My Baby\\", Hayley is shown holding out hope for Jeff's return. In the episode, Roger and Stan attempt to rush Hayley through her grieving process so she will be willing to be their tennis official.[3][42] In the episode \\"The Longest Distance Relationship\\" Jeff gets in touch with Hayley via a radio and ultimately tells her not to wait for him and to move on with her life. This story arc is finally resolved in the episode \\"Holy Shit, Jeff's Back!\\", Jeff supposedly returns to Earth but it turns out to be an alien called Zebleer masquerading as Jeff and the real Jeff has been dissected, however Jeff's brain is transplanted into Zebleer's body allowing the real Jeff to live, after which Stan and Hayley's memories are wiped, leaving them unaware that Jeff is no longer entirely human. This plot point is continued at the end of \\"Bahama Mama\\", where Roger mentions Jeff cannot get Hayley pregnant because he has an alien body, so he agrees to rebirth Jeff in \\"Roger's Baby\\". By the end of the episode, Jeff is human again and with Hayley on Earth.\\r\\nIn discussing the cartoon's distinguishing story arc element, co-creator Mike Barker explained:\\r\\nMuch of the wit used in American Dad! has come in the form of black comedy as many of the predicaments and circumstances have made fun of the characters in life-threatening, disastrous, terrifying, and traumatic situations.[43] As an example, the episode \\"A Ward Show\\" is chock full of suicide and murder: Roger became Steve's legal guardian and responded to him getting picked on at school by rigging the teachers' cars with explosives and killing them all. Later on in the episode while Principal Lewis was driving his vehicle with Steve as the passenger, he informed Steve that he was about to drive off the Grand Canyon in a murder-suicide. This culminated in Roger saving the day, his love supernaturally allowing the car to fly once Principal Lewis drove off the Canyon; however, another vehicle with a random white man and a black boy in it (opposite of Principal Lewis, a black man and Steve, a white boy) had also, coincidentally enough, driven off the opposite side of the Grand Canyon in a murder-suicide attempt. This resulted in a midair collision between the car with Principal Lewis and Steve in it and the car with the white man and black boy in it.[43] Another example, in the episode \\"Da Flippity Flop\\", Roger leaves a long series of harassing answering machine messages for Steve, trying to get him to sign up for his gym. In these messages, Roger is also heard snapping on various people, killing three individuals from reckless driving, landing himself in court, and subsequently becoming irate and shooting up numerous people at the city courthouse for being scolded to turn off his mobile phone.[44]\\r\\nMuch of the comedy on the show is in the form of cringe comedy and shock value, intended to elicit sharp disgust, discomfort or shock. The show's creators have stated that if material elicits laughter combined with groans and offense, it is a shoo-in for American Dad![29] As an example, in the episode \\"Can I Be Frank with You\\", during a massage treatment in which Roger has a nurse reaching her arms/hands up his anal/colon region to squirt water inside him, it is revealed that Roger knowingly has a live house cat residing in his anus and colon. Roger chides the cat for coming out during the massage.[45] As another example, in the episode \\"The Scarlett Getter\\", Steve magically starts having good luck whenever he wears his sister Hayley's panties. Also, in the episode \\"Stanny Boy and Frantastic\\", when Stan and Francine are free-running with new couple friends, Tom and Cami, Francine gets Stan's head out of bannisters that it is stuck in and subsequently Stan falls down multiple flights of stairs and fractures his shin bone.\\r\\nSome episodes have hinted at incest. On more than one occasion, Stan has flexed and shown off his derrire at his own children, Steve and Hayley, once even making attempts to get them to grab onto it. In the episode \\"Great Space Roaster\\", Stan remarks, \\"Steve, don't steal glances. If you want to check out my meatballs in this thing, go right ahead. I'm your dad.\\" In the episode \\"Why Can't We Be Friends?\\" as Steve turns around and walks away from an upset Stan who has just finished scolding him, Stan quietly admires his son's derrire, remarking to himself, \\"Kid's got his mother's ass, lucky bastard.\\" Further, in the episode \\"Pulling Double Booty\\", Hayley is seen making out with a man identical to her father. Mistaking him for Stan, Francine disgustedly passes out. Stan later reveals the look-alike to be a body double of his named Bill, who works for the CIA. Hayley is convinced that Bill is the one and if he dumps her, she would go \\"maximum insane\\": She would kill Bill, burn down the neighborhood, and rape Roger, according to her. While the four spend time together at the beach, Stan gives Bill a detailed account of Francine's sex drive, leading Bill to seduce and attempt to have sexual intercourse with Francine. Stan later kicks Bill out of his house. He then passes himself off as Bill to Hayley, hoping to prevent her from going \\"maximum insane\\", with Hayley under the impression that Stan is Bill, the two travel to a romantic resort, with Hayley making sexual advances on her own father.\\r\\nThere are multiple conflicting reports and models as to the number of seasons American Dad! has had.[10]\\r\\n(A): One of the reports upholds a one-season-fewer numbering model: Under this arrangement, season 1 is a combination of both the first 7 episodes and the following 16 episodes, despite the separation of these two episode collections by a summer hiatus. Under this system, season 1 is uncharacteristically longer in contrast to the rest of the show's seasons, consisting of 23 episodes.[46][47]\\r\\n(B): The other report upholds a one-season-more numbering model: Under this arrangement, season 1 ended after the program's first 7 episodes leading into the summer hiatus. Season 2 then picked up when the following 16 episodes began that fall. Under this system, season 1 is uncharacteristically shorter in contrast to the rest of the show's seasons, consisting of only 7 episodes.[48]\\r\\nCommentary from American Dad! co-creators Matt Weitzman and Mike Barker has largely been consistent with (A): on September 28, 2012, the two were interviewed and reported that they had 20 episodes completed for the then imminent \\"2012ÿ13 eighth season,\\" and were in the process of doing early work on the show's \\"2013ÿ14 ninth season.\\"[49] During the show's life on Fox however, the network contradicted that arrangement as it presented information on the show's now former website in the form of (B): in listing all episodes from the 2012ÿ13 season, Fox reported each as existing as part of the show's \\"ninth season.\\"[50] In addition, Fox contradicted its own American Dad! website, also supporting the one-season-fewer numbering scheme: Fox Flash, which is the publicity center for Fox, labeled the 2012ÿ13 broadcasts as the \\"eighth season.\\"[51] Websites releasing the show's season-based ratings have also used the one-season-fewer numbering method.\\r\\nIt is evident that Fox either miscounts American Dad! episodes or at least intentionally discounts one episode of the series. This was established in Fox advertisements for the episode \\"Lost in Space.\\" The episode was promoted by Fox as American Dad!'s 150th episode. Subsequently, numerous mainstream media reports also labeled the episode as the 150th.[52][53][54] In actuality, however, it was the show's 151st episode while the episode \\"The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith\\" was the 150th episode of the series. In addition, Fox has misreported the \\"Lost in Space\\" episode as the revealing of Roger's birth planet. In actuality, the setting of this episode is a spaceship owned by members of Roger's alien race. To date, Roger's birth planet has yet to be revealed.[55]\\r\\nWhile the series premiere of American Dad! is entitled \\"Pilot\\", \\"Pilot\\" is not the show's actual pilot presentation. The actual pilot is a 6-minute version of the first 6 minutes in the series premiere. This precursory pilot was used by MacFarlane, Barker and Weitzman to sell American Dad! to Fox and was never aired along with the rest of the series. While much of the dialogue and general scenery were simply redone between the precursory pilot and the following series premiere, there are sharp distinctions between the two. Differences also exist between the precursory pilot and the official series as a whole. Most of these are in pictorial technique. For example, scenes from the pilot are drawn in a rougher, more cursory fashion with weaker coloration than scenes from the official series. Most prominently, Steve's physical design and outfit in the predecessor greatly contrast from his official design and outfit. In addition, Steve is voiced by Ricky Blitt in the precursory pilot but by Scott Grimes in the official series. There are also variations in Steve's personality.[56][57]\\r\\nEarly episodes of the series featured political banter between the conservative Stan and liberal Hayley. However, the creators learned quickly that this had only \\"a limited shelf life\\" and did not provide them as much as they originally thought it would. Said co-creator Matt Weitzman, \\"There are times when we still have that kind of dynamic between them, but not nearly what it was in the first season. And I think the show, honestly, has grown and benefited from it, because that would have gotten boring after a while.\\"[9]\\r\\nRoger was enhanced by being provided with a running gag of alternate disguises and freedom to exist outside of the Smith house. The show's original concept basically portrayed him as being similar to Alf, having him sit in the house all day while commenting on life. The creators, however, have stated that the character was far too much fun to keep restricted to the house, and having him interact with different people provided for lots of material. The creators have further appreciated the direction of Roger for the fact that he almost serves as a different guest star for each episode what with his many alter egos. The show's staff believe this element of the show highlights MacFarlane's versatility as he voices Roger and his countless alter egos.[9]\\r\\nThere have been three versions of the \\"Steve\\" character, the creators having twice made considerable adjustments to his design. Steve's initial design ended up being a one-off execution limited to the unaired precursory pilot (not to be confused with the series premiere, entitled \\"Pilot\\"). By the season premiere, Scott Grimes had begun voicing Steve, and his design was made taller, more filled out, and less geeky. After early seasons of the series, Steve was remodeled again. This time he was made softer, more emotional, cuter and more endearing, creating a sharper contrast to his father Stan's ruggedness and machismo.[58]\\r\\nBetween the eighth and ninth seasons there were significant changes in the show's writing staff. Mike Barker mentions (with one-season-less numbering) \\"We lost some animators, and we lost a lot of writers. Season eight, our writing staff is about 65ÿ70 percent new.\\"[9]\\r\\nOn July 16, 2013, it was announced that American Dad! had been cancelled by Fox. Shortly thereafter, however, the cable station TBS picked up the show for a 15-episode 11th season, slated to premiere on October 20, 2014.[59][60] Currently, TBS airs reruns of American Dad! in syndication.[61] The tenth season was initially to be the final one on Fox; however, on July 20, 2014, it was announced that Fox had three unaired episodes left for broadcast. Two of the three aired back-to-back on September 14, 2014, and the final one aired on September 21, 2014. Reports from Fox seemed to imply that these three episodes constituted a season of their own, season 10. Among multiple discrepant reports from TBS however, one indicated that the three episodes were the beginning of the 11th season to resume on their network.[62] TBS actually debuted their first episode through social media websites YouTube and Facebook on October 13, 2014. However, the October 20, 2014 date still applies to the television debut.[63]\\r\\nOn the show's network relocation, Mike Barker has stated, \\"It's going to be the same American Dad!, just in a different place.\\" Barker also joked that the network relocation was to execute a Tyler Perry crossover they [Barker and American Dad! production staff] had long aspired to.[64] In reality, the purpose of the network relocation was Fox's move away from the \\"Animation Domination\\" format to make room for sitcoms like Brooklyn Nine-Nine. It may also have been due to the arrival of a new animated series from Family Guy writer Mark Hentemann and executive produced by American Dad! creator Seth MacFarlane called Bordertown.\\r\\nOn November 4, 2013, it was announced that Mike Barker had departed American Dad![65] Barker had served for ten seasons as the show's co-creator/executive and producer/co-showrunner. Matt Weitzman is now serving as the show's sole showrunner. The news came as early production for season 11 commenced. As of November 2013, the show's production crew was developing its first four episodes for season 11, slated to begin airing on October 20, 2014 when American Dad! moved to TBS. Barker remained under an overall contract with 20th Century Fox Television.[66][67]\\r\\nFollowing Mike Barker's exit, Brian Boyle replaced him as the showrunner for the television series[68] and his sole character on the show, Terry Bates, was written out of the series.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that American Dad! \\"is not popular in Utah or much of the South\\".[69]\\r\\nUntil season 12 when American Dad! moved to TBS, all but one episode originally aired on Animation Domination. The program's series premiere is the only episode that pre-dates the Animation Domination lineup. In addition, American Dad!'s series premiere predated the rest of the first season by roughly three months. The series premiere episode, \\"Pilot\\", aired directly following Fox's broadcast of Super Bowl XXXIX on February 6, 2005. The episode aired alongside The Simpsons and pulled in 15 million viewers,[70] with 23 million viewers overall.[71] Both Animation Domination and the rest of the show's first season commenced on May 1, 2005. The show returned with the episode \\"Threat Levels\\", obtaining 9.47 million viewers, after the season premiere/revival of Family Guy.[72]\\r\\nOn November 18, 2014, it was reported that the show's outstanding performance in cable quickly moved TBS to order another season of the series, bringing the show to 13 seasons. [11][12]\\r\\nAt Comic-Con 2013 on July 20, Mike Barker revealed that an American Dad! moviecentering on Roger and set on his birth planetmay take place in the future. Barker did not announce any specifics as it relates to the nature and type of film he and the rest of the show's creators had in mind for the series; however, he strongly suggested that a movie is where the show's staff and creators would like to take things. Barker further hinted that an American Dad! movie may already even be in the works and partially written. No further information about the movie was released following Barker's exit from the series in November 2013.[64]\\r\\nAmerican Dad! characters have appeared on other animated sitcoms and vice versa. To date, all of American Dad!'s crossovers have involved two other animated programs. The other two animated programs were also created by Seth MacFarlane: Family Guy (the crossover episode \\"Bigfat\\" also consisted of King of the Hill characters), and the cancelled series The Cleveland Show.\\r\\nOn December 8, 2013, Bart Simpson made a cameo appearance in the American Dad! season 10 episode, \\"Faking Bad\\". Though unofficial, this marked the first ever Simpsons/American Dad! crossover.[129]\\r\\nPlaytech signed on for the development of a 40-line branded slot game based on Fox Broadcasting Company's animated sitcom, American Dad. Released online in May 2017, Stan Smith, Francine, Hayley, Klaus and Roger are featured along with special game bonuses including re-spins, free spins and 'Wheels and the Legman'.[130]","input":"When did the first episode of american dad air?"},{"output":"President","context":"The President of the Republic of Korea (Hangul:????? ???; Hanja:?έg?? ξ~B; RR:?Daehan Minguk Daetongryeong) is, according to the South Korean constitution, the chairperson of the cabinet, the chief executive of the government, commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and the head of state of South Korea. The Constitution and the amended Presidential Election Act of 1987 provide for election of the president by direct, secret ballot, ending sixteen years of indirect presidential elections under the preceding two governments. The president is directly elected to a five-year term, with no possibility of re-election.[1] If a presidential vacancy should occur, a successor must be elected within sixty days, during which time presidential duties are to be performed by the prime minister or other senior cabinet members in the order of priority as determined by law. While in office, the chief executive lives in Cheong Wa Dae (the \\"Blue House\\"), and is exempt from criminal liability (except for insurrection or treason).\\r\\nMoon Jae-in, former human rights lawyer and chief of staff to then-President Roh Moo-hyun,[2] assumed post of President of South Korea on 10 May 2017[3] immediately upon being elected with a plurality of 41.1%, in contrast to 24.0% and 21.4% won by his major opponents, conservative Hong Joon-pyo and centrist Ahn Cheol-soo, respectively.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 3 of the South Korean constitution states the duties and the powers of the president. The president is required to:\\r\\nAlso, the president is given the powers:\\r\\nIf the National Assembly votes against a presidential decision, it will be declared void immediately.\\r\\nThe president may refer important policy matters to a national referendum, declare war, conclude peace and other treaties, appoint senior public officials, and grant amnesty (with the concurrence of the National Assembly). In times of serious internal or external turmoil or threat, or economic or financial crises, the president may assume emergency powers \\"for the maintenance of national security or public peace and order.\\" Emergency measures may be taken only when the National Assembly is not in session and when there is no time for it to convene. The measures are limited to the \\"minimum necessary.\\"\\r\\nThe 1987 Constitution removed the 1980 Constitution's explicit provisions that empowered the government to temporarily suspend the freedoms and rights of the people. However, the president is permitted to take other measures that could amend or abolish existing laws for the duration of a crisis. It is unclear whether such emergency measures could temporarily suspend portions of the Constitution itself. Emergency measures must be referred to the National Assembly for concurrence. If not endorsed by the assembly, the emergency measures can be revoked; any laws that had been overridden by presidential order regain their original effect. In this respect, the power of the legislature is more vigorously asserted than in cases of ratification of treaties or declarations of war, in which the Constitution simply states that the National Assembly \\"has the right to consent\\" to the president's actions. In a change from the 1980 Constitution, the 1987 Constitution stated that the president is not permitted to dissolve the National Assembly.\\r\\nThe official residence of the president is Cheong Wa Dae. It means 'the House of the Blue Roof Tiles', so it is also called the \\"Blue House\\" in English. The president is assisted by the staff of the Presidential Secretariat, headed by a cabinet-rank secretary general. Apart from the State Council, or cabinet, the chief executive relies on several constitutional organs.\\r\\nThese constitutional organs included the National Security Council, which provided advice concerning the foreign, military, and domestic policies bearing on national security. Chaired by the president, the council in 1990 had as its statutory members the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the ministers for foreign affairs, home affairs, finance, and national defense, the director of the Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP) which was known as the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) until December 1980, and others designated by the president. Another important body is the National Unification Advisory Council, inaugurated in June 1981 under the chairpersonship of the president. From its inception, this body had no policy role, but rather appeared to serve as a government sounding board and as a means to disburse political rewards by providing large numbers of dignitaries and others with titles and opportunities to meet periodically with the president and other senior officials.\\r\\nThe president also was assisted in 1990 by the Audit and Inspection Board. In addition to auditing the accounts of all public institutions, the board scrutinized the administrative performance of government agencies and public officials. Its findings were reported to the president and the National Assembly, which itself had broad powers to inspect the work of the bureaucracy under the provisions of the Constitution. Board members were appointed by the president.\\r\\nOne controversial constitutional organ was the Advisory Council of Elder Statesmen, which replaced a smaller body in February 1988, just before Roh Tae Woo was sworn in as president. This body was supposed to be chaired by the immediate former president; its expansion to eighty members, broadened functions, and elevation to cabinet rank made it appear to have been designed, as one Seoul newspaper said, to \\"preserve the status and position of a certain individual.\\" The government announced plans to reduce the size and functions of this body immediately after Roh's inauguration. Public suspicions that the council might provide former President Chun with a power base within the Sixth Republic were rendered moot when Chun withdrew to an isolated Buddhist temple in self-imposed exile in November 1988.\\r\\nArticle 71 of the Constitution of South Korea states, 'In the event of the president not being able to discharge the duties of his/her office, the Prime Minister and ministers in line of the order of succession shall be the acting president.' Article 68 of the Constitution requires the acting president to hold new elections within 60 days.\\r\\nAccording to article 12, section 2 and article 22, section 1 of the Government Organization Act, order of succession follows:\\r\\n1stÿ3rd term\\r\\nRhee Syngman\\r\\n(served: 1948ÿ1960)\\r\\nHeo Jeong\\r\\n(acting: AprilÿJune, JuneÿAugust 1960)[a]\\r\\nKwak Sang-hoon\\r\\n(acting: June 1960)\\r\\nBaek Nak-jun\\r\\n(acting: August 1960)\\r\\n4th term\\r\\nYun Bo-seon\\r\\n(served: 1960ÿ1962)\\r\\n5thÿ9th term\\r\\nPark Chung-hee\\r\\n(acting: March 1962?ÿ December 1963)\\r\\n(served: 1963ÿ1979)\\r\\n10th term\\r\\nChoi Kyu-hah\\r\\n(acting: OctoberÿDecember 1979)\\r\\n(served: 1979ÿ1980)\\r\\n11th & 12th term\\r\\nChun Doo-hwan\\r\\n(served: 1980ÿ1988)\\r\\n13th term\\r\\nRoh Tae-woo\\r\\n(served: 1988ÿ1993)\\r\\n14th term\\r\\nKim Young-sam\\r\\n(served: 1993ÿ1998)\\r\\n15th term\\r\\nKim Dae-jung\\r\\n(served: 1998ÿ2003)\\r\\n16th term\\r\\nRoh Moo-hyun\\r\\n(served: 2003ÿ2008)\\r\\nGoh Kun\\r\\n(acting: MarchÿMay 2004)[b]\\r\\n17th term\\r\\nLee Myung-bak\\r\\n(served: 2008ÿ2013)\\r\\n18th term\\r\\nPark Geun-hye\\r\\n(served: 2013ÿ2017)\\r\\nHwang Kyo-ahn\\r\\n(acting: December 2016ÿMay 2017)[c]\\r\\n19th term\\r\\nMoon Jae-in\\r\\n(served: 2017ÿpresent)\\r\\nAs of June 2018, four former presidents are alive:\\r\\nThe longest-lived President was Yun Bo-seon, who died on July 18, 1990 (at the age of 92?years, 326?days).\\r\\nThe most recent President to die was Kim Young-sam, who died on November 22, 2015 (at the age of 87?years, 337?days).","input":"What kind of leader does south korea have?"},{"output":"bearskin","context":"King Kong is a 1933 American pre-Code monster adventure film[4] directed and produced by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack. The screenplay by James Ashmore Creelman and Ruth Rose was from an idea conceived by Cooper and Edgar Wallace. It stars Fay Wray, Bruce Cabot and Robert Armstrong, and opened in New York City on March 2, 1933, to rave reviews. It has been ranked by Rotten Tomatoes as the greatest horror film of all time[5] and the twentieth greatest film of all time.[6]\\r\\nThe film tells of a gigantic, prehistoric, island-dwelling ape called Kong who dies in an attempt to possess a beautiful young woman. King Kong is especially noted for its stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien and a groundbreaking musical score by Max Steiner. In 1991, it was deemed \\"culturally, historically and aesthetically significant\\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. It has been remade twice, in 1976 and 2005, while a reboot, Kong: Skull Island, was released in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn New York Harbor, filmmaker Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), famous for making wildlife films in remote and exotic locations, charters Captain Englehorn's (Frank Reicher) ship Venture for his new project, but is unable to secure an actress for a female role he has reluctantly added to the script. Due to set sail that night, Denham searches the streets of New York for a suitable woman. He meets penniless Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) and convinces her to join him for what he proposes as the adventure of a lifetime. The Venture quickly gets underway and, during the voyage, the surly first mate, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), gradually falls in love with Ann.\\r\\nAfter weeks of secrecy, Denham finally tells Englehorn and Driscoll that their destination is Skull Island, an uncharted land shown on a map in Denham's possession. Denham also cryptically alludes to some monstrous creature rumored to dwell on the island, a legendary entity known only as \\"Kong\\". When they find the island and anchor offshore, they see a native village, separated from the rest of the island by an enormous ancient stone wall. A landing party, including the filming crew and Ann, witnesses a group of natives preparing to sacrifice a young maiden as the \\"bride of Kong\\". The intruders are spotted and the native chief (Noble Johnson) angrily stops the ceremony. When he sees the blonde Ann, he offers to trade six of his tribal women for the \\"golden woman\\". They rebuff him and return to the Venture.\\r\\nThat night, a band of natives kidnap Ann from the ship and lead her through a huge wooden gate in the wall. Tied to an altar, she is offered to Kong, who turns out to be an enormous gorilla-like ape. Kong carries her off into the jungle as the Venture crew, alerted to Ann's abduction, arrive. They open the gate and Denham, Driscoll and some volunteers enter the jungle in hopes of rescuing Ann. They soon discover that Kong is far from the only giant prehistoric creature on the island when they are charged by a Stegosaurus, which they manage to kill. After constructing a raft in order to cross a swamp, a Brontosaurus capsizes their supplies, killing several of the men. Fleeing through the jungle, they soon encounter Kong, who tries to stop them from crossing a ravine by shaking them off a fallen tree that bridges it. Only Driscoll and Denham, on opposite sides, survive.\\r\\nA Tyrannosaurus threatens Ann, but Kong kills it after a colossal battle by breaking its neck and jaw. Driscoll continues to shadow Kong and Ann while Denham returns to the village for more men. Upon arriving in Kong's lair in a mountain cave, Ann is menaced by a snake-like Elasmosaurus, which Kong wrestles and kills. While Kong is distracted killing a Pteranodon that tried to fly away with Ann, Driscoll reaches her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong notices and starts pulling them back up, they let go and fall unharmed into the water below. They run through the jungle and back to the village, where Denham, Englehorn and the surviving crewmen are waiting. Kong, following, breaks open the gate and murderously rampages through the village. On shore, Denham, now determined to bring Kong back alive, knocks him unconscious with a gas bomb.\\r\\nShackled in chains of chrome steel, Kong is presented to a Broadway theatre audience as \\"Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World\\". Ann and Jack are brought on stage to join him, followed by an invited group of press photographers. Kong, believing that the ensuing flash photography is an attack, breaks loose as the audience flees in terror. Ann is whisked away to a hotel room on a high floor, but Kong, scaling the building, soon finds her. Kong's hand smashes through the hotel room window, knocking Jack unconscious and seizing Ann. Kong rampages through the city. He wrecks a crowded elevated train and ultimately climbs the Empire State Building. At its top, he is met by four Observation Aircraft. Kong sets Ann down and battles the planes, managing to down one of them, but he finally succumbs to their gunfire and falls to his death. Ann and Jack are reunited. Denham arrives and pushes through a crowd surrounding Kong's body in the street. When a policeman remarks that the planes got him, Denham tells him, \\"Oh, no, it wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast.\\"\\r\\nBefore King Kong entered production, a long tradition of jungle films existed, and, whether drama or documentary, such films generally adhered to a narrative pattern that followed an explorer or scientist into the jungle to test a theory only to discover some monstrous aberration in the undergrowth (see Stark Mad). In such films, scientific knowledge could be turned topsy-turvy at any time, and it was this that provided the genre with its vitality, appeal, and endurance.[7]\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, few zoos had primate exhibits so there was popular demand to see them on film. At the turn of the 20th century, the Lumire Brothers sent film documentarians to places westerners had never seen, and Georges Mlis utilized trick photography in film fantasies that prefigured that in King Kong. Jungle films were launched in the United States in 1913 with Beasts in the Jungle, a film that mixed live actors with lions, a tiger, and other animals. The film's popularity spawned similar pictures, including a few about \\"ape men\\" and gorillas. In 1918, Elmo Lincoln starred in Tarzan of the Apes,[7] and, in 1925, The Lost World made movie history with special effects by Willis O'Brien and a crew that later would work on King Kong.[8] William S. Campbell specialized in monkey-themed films with Monkey Stuff and Jazz Monkey in 1919, with Prohibition Monkey following in 1920. King Kong producer Ernest B. Schoedsack had earlier monkey experience directing Chang: A Drama of the Wilderness in 1927 (also with Merian C. Cooper) and Rango in 1931, both of which prominently featured monkeys in authentic jungle settings. Capitalizing on this trend, Congo Pictures released the hoax documentary Ingagi in 1930, advertising the film as \\"an authentic incontestable celluloid document showing the sacrifice of a living woman to mammoth gorillas.\\" Ingagi was an unabashed black exploitation film, immediately running afoul of the Hollywood code of ethics, as it implicitly depicted black women having sex with gorillas, and baby offspring that looked more ape than human.[9] The film was an immediate hit, and by some estimates it was one of the highest-grossing movies of the 1930s at over $4 million. Although Cooper never listed Ingagi among his influences for King Kong, it has long been held that RKO green-lit Kong because of the bottom-line example of Ingagi and the formula that \\"gorillas plus sexy women in peril equals enormous profits\\".[10]\\r\\nMerian C. Cooper's fascination with gorillas began with his boyhood reading of Paul Du Chaillu's Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa (1861) and was furthered in 1929 by studying a tribe of baboons in Africa while filming The Four Feathers. After reading W. Douglas Burden's The Dragon Lizards of Komodo, he fashioned a scenario depicting African gorillas battling Komodo dragons intercut with artificial stand-ins for joint shots. He then narrowed the dramatis personae to one ferocious, lizard-battling gorilla (rather than a group) and included a lone woman on expedition to appease those critics who belabored him for neglecting romance in his films. A remote island would be the setting and the gorilla would be dealt a spectacular death in New York City.[11]\\r\\nCooper took his concept to Paramount Studios in the first years of the Great Depression but executives shied away from a project that sent film crews on costly shoots to Africa and Komodo. In 1931, David O. Selznick brought Cooper to RKO as his executive assistant, and, to sweeten the deal, promised him he could make his own films. Cooper began immediately developing The Most Dangerous Game, a story about a big game hunter, and hired his friend and former film partner, Ernest B. Schoedsack, to direct. A huge jungle stage set was built, with Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray as the stars. Once the film was underway, Cooper turned his attention to the studio's big-budget-out-of-control fantasy, Creation, a story about a group of travelers shipwrecked on an island of dinosaurs. The film employed special effects wizard Willis O'Brien.[12]\\r\\nWhen Cooper screened O'Brien's stop-motion Creation footage, he was unimpressed, but realized he could economically make his gorilla picture by scrapping the Komodo dragons and costly location shoots for O'Brien's animated dinosaurs and the studio's existing jungle set. It was at this time Cooper probably cast his gorilla as a giant named Kong, and planned to have him die at the Empire State Building. The RKO board was wary about the project, but gave its approval after Cooper organized a presentation with Wray, Armstrong, and Cabot, and O'Brien's model dinosaurs. In his executive capacity, Cooper ordered the Creation production shelved, and put its crew to work on Kong.[13]\\r\\nCooper assigned recently hired RKO screenwriter and best-selling British mystery/adventure writer Edgar Wallace the job of writing a screenplay and a novel based on his gorilla fantasy. Cooper understood the commercial appeal of Wallace's name and planned to publicize the film as being \\"based on the novel by Edgar Wallace\\". Wallace conferred with Cooper and O'Brien (who contributed, among other things, the \\"Ann's dress\\" scene) and began work on January 1, 1932. He completed a rough draft called The Beast on January 5, 1932. Cooper thought the draft needed considerable work but Wallace died on February 10, 1932, just after beginning revisions.[7][14] Despite not using any of the draft in the final production beyond the previously agreed upon plot outline, Cooper gave a screen credit to Wallace as he had promised it as a producer.\\r\\nCooper called in James Ashmore Creelman (who was working on the script of The Most Dangerous Game at the time) and the two men worked together on several drafts under the title The Eighth Wonder. Some details from Wallace's rough draft were dropped, notably his boatload of escaped convicts. Wallace's Danby Denham character, a big game hunter, became film director Carl Denham. His Shirley became Ann Darrow and her lover-convict John became Jack Driscoll. The 'beauty and the beast' angle was first developed at this time. Kong's escape was switched from Madison Square Garden to Yankee Stadium and (finally) to a Broadway theater. Cute moments involving the gorilla in Wallace's draft were cut because Cooper wanted Kong hard and tough in the belief that his fall would be all the more awesome and tragic.[14]\\r\\nTime constraints forced Creelman to temporarily drop The Eighth Wonder and devote his time to the Game script. RKO staff writer Horace McCoy was called in to work with Cooper, and it was he who introduced the island natives, a giant wall, and the sacrificial maidens into the plot. Leon Gordon also contributed to the screenplay in a minimal capacity; both he and McCoy went uncredited in the completed film.[15] When Creelman returned to the script full-time, he hated McCoy's 'mythic elements', believing the script already had too many over-the-top concepts, but Cooper insisted on keeping them in. RKO head Selznick and his executives wanted Kong introduced earlier in the film (believing the audience would grow bored waiting for his appearance), but Cooper persuaded them that a suspenseful build-up would make Kong's entrance all the more exciting.[16]\\r\\nCooper felt Creelman's final draft was slow-paced, too full of flowery dialogue, weighted-down with long scenes of exposition,[16] and written on a scale that would have been prohibitively expensive to film.[17] Writer Ruth Rose (Schoedsack's wife) was brought in to for rewrites and, although she had never written a screenplay, undertook the task with a complete understanding of Cooper's style, streamlining the script and tightening the action. Rather than explaining how Kong would be transported to New York, for example, she simply cut from the island to the theater. She incorporated autobiographical elements into the script with Cooper mirrored in the Denham character, her husband Schoedsack in the tough but tender Driscoll character, and herself in struggling actress Ann Darrow. Rose also rewrote the dialogue and created the film's opening sequence, showing Denham meeting Ann on the streets of New York. Cooper was delighted with Rose's script, approving the newly re-titled Kong for production.[18] Cooper and Schoedsack decided to co-direct scenes but their styles were different (Cooper was slow and meticulous, Schoedsack brisk) and they finally agreed to work separately, with Cooper overseeing O'Brien's miniature work and directing the special effects sequences, and Schoedsack directing the dialogue scenes.[19]\\r\\nFay Wray played bit parts in Hollywood until cast as the lead in Erich von Stroheim's 1928 silent film, The Wedding March. She met Kong co-directors Cooper and Schoedsack when cast as Ethne Eustace in The Four Feathers in 1929. Cooper cast her in 1932 as Eve Trowbridge in The Most Dangerous Game.[20]\\r\\nAfter the RKO board approved the Kong test, Cooper decided a blonde would provide contrast to the gorilla's dark pelt. Dorothy Jordan, Jean Harlow, and Ginger Rogers were considered, but the role finally went to Wray who wore a blonde wig in the film and was inspired more by Cooper's enthusiasm than the script to accept the role. According to her autobiography, On the Other Hand, Wray recounts that Cooper had told her he planned to star her opposite the \\"tallest, darkest leading man in Hollywood\\". She assumed he meant Clark Gable until he showed her a picture of Kong climbing the Empire State Building.[20]\\r\\nOn the film's 50th anniversary in 1983, one New York theater held a Fay Wray scream-alike contest in its lobby,[15] and, two days after her death on August 8, 2004, the lights of the Empire State Building were dimmed for 15 minutes in her memory.[21]\\r\\nMichigan native and veteran Broadway and silent film character actor Robert Armstrong played Wray's alcoholic brother in The Most Dangerous Game and, during filming, became a member of the Cooper-Schoedsack inner circle. He was a shoo-in as Denham when Kong was cast.[20] The film's romantic angle (rather than its jungle or animal angle) was played-up after animal films fared poorly at the box office in the early months of 1933. One exhibitor displayed a promotional still of Wray swooning in Armstrong's arms with the caption, \\"Their Hearts Stood Still...For There Stood Kong! A Love Story of Today That Spans the Ages!\\". Although the film's romantic subplot belongs to Cabot and Wray, established star Armstrong was chosen for the ad rather than the unknown Cabot.[22] Months later, Armstrong again played Carl Denham in Kong's sequel, Son of Kong (1933).[23]\\r\\nNew Mexico native Jacques De Bujac was signed by Selznick as a contract player, given the name Bruce Cabot, and met Cooper when auditioning for The Most Dangerous Game. He almost walked out of his Kong audition (mistakenly believing he was trying out as a stunt double for Joel McCrea) but was convinced otherwise and received the role of Jack Driscoll, his first starring role.[24] He was an inexperienced actor and described his participation in Kong as standing in the right place, doing what he was told, and collecting a paycheck.[25]\\r\\nGerman-born Broadway veteran and silent film director Frank Reicher was cast as Captain Englehorn of the SS Venture, Victor Wong as the ship's cook Charlie, James Flavin as Second Mate Briggs, and a host of stuntmen and bit players as the ship's crew. Noble Johnson and Steve Clemente were members of the Cooper-Schoedsack inner circle and cast as the Native Chief and the Witch Doctor respectively while Etta McDaniel played a native mother of a child she rescues from Kong's rampage. Sam Hardy was cast as a theatrical agent and Sandra Shaw (later Mrs. Gary Cooper) was cast as the New York woman Kong drops to the street from the hotel ledge.[26] Merian C. Cooper, who was shot down in World War I in an Airco DH.4 and made a prisoner of war by the Germans, and who later flew with the Kosciuszko Squadron, played the airplane pilot and Schoedsack the machine gunner in uncredited roles in the film's final scenes.[27]\\r\\nAfter the RKO board approved the production of a test reel, Marcel Delgado constructed Kong (or the \\"Giant Terror Gorilla\\" as he was then known) per designs and directions from Cooper and O'Brien on a one-inch-equals-one-foot scale to simulate a gorilla 18 feet tall.[citation needed] Four models were built: two jointed 18-inch aluminum, foam rubber, latex, and rabbit fur models (to be rotated during filming), one jointed 24-inch model of the same materials for the New York scenes, and a small model of lead and fur for the plummeting-down-the-Empire-State-Building scene.[citation needed] At least two armatures have survived - one believed to be the original made for the test footage - and are owned by Peter Jackson and Bob Burns.[28] In 2009, one sold for S121,000 ($200,000) at Christie's in London.[29]\\r\\nKong's torso was streamlined to eliminate the comical appearance of the real world gorilla's prominent belly and buttocks. His lips, eyebrows, and nose were fashioned of rubber, his eyes of glass, and his facial expressions controlled by thin, bendable wires threaded through holes drilled in his aluminum skull. During filming, Kong's rubber skin dried out quickly under studio lights, making it necessary to replace it often and completely rebuild his facial features.[30]\\r\\nA huge bust of Kong's head, neck, and upper chest was made of wood, cloth, rubber, and bearskin by Delgado, E. B. Gibson, and Fred Reefe.[citation needed] Inside the structure, metal levers, hinges, and an air compressor were operated by three men to control the mouth and facial expressions. Its fangs were 10 inches in length and its eyeballs 12 inches in diameter. The bust was moved from set to set on a flatcar. Its scale matched none of the models and, if fully realized, Kong would have stood thirty to forty feet tall.[31]\\r\\nTwo versions of Kong's right hand and arm were constructed of steel, sponge rubber, rubber, and bearskin.[citation needed] The first hand was non articulated, mounted on a crane, and operated by grips for the scene in which Kong grabs at Driscoll in the cave. The other hand and arm had articulated fingers, was mounted on a lever to elevate it, and was used in the several scenes in which Kong grasps Ann. A non articulated leg was created of materials similar to the hands, mounted on a crane, and used to stomp on Kong's victims.[32]\\r\\nThe dinosaurs were made by Delgado in the same fashion as Kong and based on Charles R. Knight's murals in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. All the armatures were manufactured in the RKO machine shop. Materials used were cotton, foam rubber, latex sheeting, and liquid latex. Football bladders were placed inside some models to simulate breathing.[citation needed] A scale of one-inch-equals-one-foot was employed and models ranged from 18 inches to 3 feet in length. Several of the models were originally built for Creation and sometimes two or three models were built of individual species. Prolonged exposure to studio lights wreaked havoc with the latex skin so John Cerasoli carved wooden duplicates of each model to be used as stand-ins for test shoots and lineups. He carved wooden models of Ann, Driscoll, and other human characters. Models of the Venture, railway cars, and war planes were built.[34]\\r\\nKing Kong is well known for its groundbreaking use of special effects, such as stop-motion animation, matte painting, rear projection and miniatures, all of which were conceived decades before the digital age.\\r\\nThe numerous prehistoric creatures inhabiting Skull Island were brought to life through the use of stop-motion animation by Willis OBrien and his assistant animator, Buzz Gibson. The stop-motion animation scenes were painstaking and difficult to achieve and complete after the special effects crew realized that they could not stop, because it would make the movements of the creatures seem inconsistent and the lighting would not have the same intensity over the many days it took to fully animate a finished sequence. A device called the surface gauge was used in order to keep track of the stop-motion animation performance. The iconic fight between Kong and the Tyrannosaurus took seven weeks to be completed. OBriens proteg, Ray Harryhausen, who would work with him on several films and become one of the most prominent stop-motion animators in Hollywood, stated that OBriens second wife noticed that there was so much of her husband in Kong.\\r\\nThe backdrop of Skull Island seen when the Venture crew first arrive was painted on glass by matte painters Henry Hillinck, Mario Larrinaga and Byron C. Crabb. The scene was then composted with separate bird elements and rear projected behind the ship and the actors. The background of the scenes in the jungle (a miniature set) were also painted on several layers of glass to convey the illusion of deep and dense jungle foliage.\\r\\nThe most difficult task for the special effects artists to achieve was to make live-action footage interact with separately filmed stop-motion animation - to make the interaction between the humans and the creatures of the island seem believable. The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame, than running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing the other part of the frame with a different image. The most complex shots, where the live-action actors interacted with the stop-motion animation, were achieved via two different techniques, the Dunning process and the Williams process, in order to produce the effect of a travelling matte. The Dunning process, invented by cinematographer Carroll H. Dunning, employed the use of blue and yellow lighting, filtered and photographed into black-and-white film. Bi packing of the camera was used for these types of effects. With it, the special effects crew could combine two strips of different film at the same time, creating the final composite shot in the camera. It was used in the climactic scene where one of the Curtiss Helldiver planes attacking Kong crashes from the top of the Empire State Building, and in the scene where natives are running through the foreground, while Kong is fighting other natives at the wall.\\r\\nOn the other hand, the Williams process, invented by cinematographer Frank D. Williams, did not require a system of colored lights and could be used for wider shots. It was used in the scene where Kong is shaking the sailors off the log, as well as the scene where Kong pushes the gates open. The Williams process did not use bipacking, but rather an optical printer, the first such device that synchronized a projector with a camera, so that several strips of film could be combined into a single composted image. Through the use of the optical printer, the special effects crew could film the foreground, the stop-motion animation, the live-action footage, and the background, and combine all of those elements into one single shot. The optical printer would continue to be used for films until the late 1980s, when they were superseded by digital composting.\\r\\nAnother technique that was used in combining live actors and stop-motion animation was rear-screen projection. The actor would have a translucent screen behind him where a projector would project footage onto the back of the translucent screen. The translucent screen was developed by Sidney Saunders and Fred Jackman, who received a Special Achievement Oscar. It was used in the famous scene where Kong and the Tyrannosaurus fight while Ann watches from the branches of a nearby tree. The stop-motion animation was filmed first. Fay Wray then spent a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree acting out her observation of the battle, which was projected onto the translucent screen while the camera filmed her witnessing the projected stop-motion battle. She was sore for days after the shoot. The same process was also used for the scene where sailors from the Venture kill a Stegosaurus.\\r\\nOBrien and his special effects crew also devised a way to use rear-projection in miniature sets. A tiny screen was built into the miniature onto which live-action footage would then be projected. A fan pumped cool air to prevent the footage that was projected from melting or catching fire. This miniature rear projection was used in the scene where Kong is trying to grab Driscoll, who is hiding in a cave. The scene where Kong puts Ann in the top of a tree switched from a puppet in Kong's hand to a projected footage of Ann sitting.\\r\\nThe scene where Kong fights the snake-like reptile in his lair was likely the most significant special effects achievement of the film, due to the way in which all of the elements in the sequence work together at the same time. The scene was accomplished through the use of a miniature set, stop-motion animation for Kong, background matte paintings, real water, foreground rocks with bubbling mud, smoke and two miniature rear screen projections of Driscoll and Ann.\\r\\nOver the years, some media reports have alleged that in certain scenes Kong was played by an actor wearing a gorilla suit.[35][36] However, film historians are generally agreed that all scenes involving Kong were achieved with animated models.[37][38]\\r\\nKing Kong was filmed in several stages over an eight-month period. Some actors had so much time between their Kong periods that they were able to fully complete work on other films. Cabot completed Road House and Wray appeared in the horror films Dr. X and Mystery of the Wax Museum. She estimated she worked for ten weeks on Kong over its eight-month production.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn May and June 1932, Cooper directed the first live-action Kong scenes on the jungle set built for The Most Dangerous Game. Some of these scenes were incorporated into the test reel later exhibited for the RKO board. The script was still in revision when the jungle scenes were shot and much of the dialogue was improvised. The jungle set was scheduled to be struck after Game was completed, so Cooper filmed all of the other jungle scenes at this time. The last scene shot was that of Driscoll and Ann racing through the jungle to safety following their escape from Kong's lair.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn July 1932, the native village was readied while Schoedsack and his crew filmed establishing shots in the harbor of New York City. Curtiss F8C-5/O2C-1 Helldiver war planes taking off and in flight were filmed at a U.S. Naval airfield on Long Island. Views of New York City were filmed from the Empire State Building for backgrounds in the final scenes and architectural plans for the mooring mast were secured from the building's owners for a mock-up to be constructed on the Hollywood sound stage.[39]\\r\\nIn August 1932, the island landing party scene and the gas bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at San Pedro, California. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the RKO-Path lot in Culver City with the native huts recycled from Bird of Paradise (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from DeMille's The King of Kings (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might go up in flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for Gone With the Wind's burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the scene depicting a New York woman being dropped to her apparent death from a hotel window was filmed on the sound stage using the articulated hand. At the same time, a scene depicting poker players surprised by Kong's face peering through a window was filmed using the 'big head', although the scene was eventually dropped.[40] When filming was completed, a break was scheduled to finish construction of the interior sets and to allow screenwriter Ruth Rose time to finish the script.\\r\\nIn SeptemberÿOctober 1932, Schoedsack returned to the sound stage after completing the native village shoots in Culver City. The decks and cabins of the Venture were constructed and all the live-action shipboard scenes were then filmed. The New York scenes were filmed, including the scene of Ann being plucked from the streets by Denham, and the diner scene. Following completion of the interior scenes, Schoedsack returned to San Pedro and spent a day on a tramp steamer to film the scene of Driscoll punching Ann, and various atmospheric harbor scenes. The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles was rented for one day to film the scenes where Kong is displayed in chains and the backstage theater scenes following his escape.[41] Principal photography wrapped at the end of October 1932 with the filming of the climax wherein Driscoll rescues Ann at the top of the Empire State Building. Schoedsack's work was completed and he headed to Syria to film outdoor scenes for Arabia, a project that was never completed.[42]\\r\\nIn December 1932 ÿ January 1933, the actors were called back to film a number of optical effects shots which were mostly rear-screen projections.[citation needed] Technical problems inherent in the process made filming difficult and time-consuming. Wray spent most of a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree to witness the battle between Kong and a Tyrannosaurus. She was sore for days after. Many of the scenes featuring Wray in the articulated hand were filmed at this time.[citation needed] In December, Cooper re shot the scene of the female New Yorker falling to her death. Stunt doubles were filmed for the water scenes depicting Driscoll and Ann escaping from Kong. A portion of the jungle set was reconstructed to film Denham snagging his sleeve on a branch during the pursuit scene. Originally, Denham ducked behind a bush to escape danger, but this was later considered cowardly and the scene was re shot. The final scene was originally staged on the top of the Empire State Building, but Cooper was dissatisfied and re shot the scene with Kong lying dead in the street with the crowd gathered about him.[citation needed]\\r\\nKing Kong was settled upon as the title, and the film cut from 125 to 100 minutes, with scenes that slowed the pace or diverted attention from Kong deleted. Infamously, the deleted scene was what later became known as the \\"Spider Pit Sequence\\", where a number of sailors from the Venture survived a fall into a ravine, only to be eaten alive by various large spiders, insects and other creatures. In a studio memo, Merian C. Cooper said that he cut the scene out himself because it \\"stopped the story\\". Aside from some still photographs and pre-production artwork, no trace of it has ever been found. Decades later, Peter Jackson would incorporate a re-imagining of this sequence for his 2005 King Kong remake, and he also shot another version of the scene for fun using stop-motion animation, which was included among the bonus features of the two-disc DVD of the 1933 original.[43]\\r\\nMurray Spivack provided the sound effects for the film. Kong's roar was created by mixing the recorded roars of zoo lions and tigers, subsequently played backwards slowly. Spivak himself provided Kong's \\"love grunts\\" by grunting into a megaphone and playing it at a slow speed. For the huge ape's footsteps, Spivak stomped across a gravel-filled box with plungers wrapped in foam attached to his own feet, while the sounds of his chest beats were recorded by Spivak hitting his assistant (who had a microphone held to his back) on the chest with a drumstick. Spivak created the hisses and croaks of the dinosaurs with an air compressor for the former and his own vocals for the latter. The vocalizations of the Tyrannosaurus were additionally mixed in with puma screams. Bird squawks were used for the Pteranodon. Spivak also provided the numerous screams of the various sailors. Fay Wray herself provided all of her character's screams in a single recording session.[44][45]\\r\\nFor budget reasons, RKO decided not to have an original film score composed, instead instructing composer Max Steiner to simply reuse music from other films. Cooper thought the film deserved an original score and paid Steiner $50,000 to compose it. Steiner completed the score in six weeks and recorded it with a 46-piece orchestra. The studio later reimbursed Cooper.[46] The score was unlike any that came before and marked a significant change in the history of film music. King Kong's score was the first feature-length musical score written for an American \\"talkie\\" film, the first major Hollywood film to have a thematic score rather than background music, the first to mark the use of a 46-piece orchestra, and the first to be recorded on three separate tracks (sound effects, dialogue, and music). Steiner used a number of new film scoring techniques, such as drawing upon opera conventions for his use of leitmotifs.[47]\\r\\nKing Kong opened at the 6,200-seat Radio City Music Hall in New York City and the 3,700-seat RKO Roxy across the street on Thursday, March 2, 1933. The film was preceded by a stage show called Jungle Rhythms. Crowds lined up around the block on opening day, tickets were priced at $.35 to $.75, and, in its first four days, every one of its ten-shows-a-day were sold out?ÿ setting an all-time attendance record for an indoor event. Over the four-day period, the film grossed $89,931.[48]\\r\\nThe film had its official world premiere on March 23, 1933 at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. The 'big head bust' was placed in the theater's forecourt and a seventeen-act show preceded the film with The Dance of the Sacred Ape performed by a troupe of African American dancers the highpoint. Kong cast and crew attended and Wray thought her on-screen screams distracting and excessive. The film opened nationwide on April 10, 1933, and worldwide on Easter Day in London, England.[48]\\r\\nVariety thought the film was a powerful adventure.[49] The New York Times gave readers an enthusiastic account of the plot and thought the film a fascinating adventure.[50] John Mosher of The New Yorker called it \\"ridiculous\\", but wrote that there were \\"many scenes in this picture that are certainly diverting\\".[51] The New York World-Telegram said it was \\"one of the very best of all the screen thrillers, done with all the cinema's slickest camera tricks\\".[52] The Chicago Tribune called it \\"one of the most original, thrilling and mammoth novelties to emerge from a movie studio.\\"[53]\\r\\nOn February 3, 2002, Roger Ebert included King Kong in his \\"Great Movies\\" list, writing that \\"In modern times the movie has aged, as critic James Berardinelli observes, and 'advances in technology and acting have dated aspects of the production.' Yes, but in the very artificiality of some of the special effects, there is a creepiness that isn't there in today's slick, flawless, computer-aided images.... Even allowing for its slow start, wooden acting and wall-to-wall screaming, there is something ageless and primeval about \\"King Kong\\" that still somehow works.\\"[54] King Kong holds an average score of 98% based on 54 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.[55]\\r\\nIn the 19th and early twentieth century, people of African descent were commonly visually represented as ape-like, a metaphor that fitted racist stereotypes, further bolstered by the emergence of scientific racism. Early blockbuster films frequently mirrored racial tensions. While King Kong is often compared to the story of Beauty and the Beast, many film scholars have argued that the film was a racist cautionary tale about interracial romance, in which the film's \\"carrier of blackness is not a human being, but an ape\\".[56] Cooper and Schoedsack rejected any allegorical interpretations, insisting in interviews that the film's story contained no hidden meanings.[57]\\r\\nThe film was a box office success making about $2 million in rentals on its initial release, with an opening weekend estimated at $90,000. Receipts fell by up to 50% in the second week of the film's release because of the national \\"bank holiday\\" called in President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first days in office;[58] the film still did nicely. During the film's first run it made a profit of $650,000.[3] It was re-released in 1938, 1942, 1946, 1952 and 1956. After the 1952 re-release, Variety estimated the film had made $4 million in cumulative domestic rentals for that year.[59]\\r\\nKong did not receive any Academy Awards nominations. Selznick wanted to nominate O'Brien and his crew for a special award in visual effects but the Academy declined. Such a category did not exist at the time and would not exist until 1938. Sidney Saunders and Fred Jackman received a special achievement award for the development of the translucent acetate/cellulose rear screen?ÿ the only Kong-related award.[60]\\r\\nThe film has since received some significant honors. In 1975, Kong was named one of the 50 best American films by the American Film Institute, and, in 1991, the film was deemed \\"culturally, historically and aesthetically significant\\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In 1998, the AFI ranked the film #43 on its list of the 100 greatest movies of all time.[61]\\r\\nAmerican Film Institute Lists\\r\\nKing Kong was re-released in 1938, 1942, 1946, 1952 and 1956, to great box office success. Stricter decency rules had been put into effect in Hollywood since its 1933 premiere and each time it was censored further, with several scenes, being either trimmed or excised altogether.\\r\\nThese scenes were as follows:[62]\\r\\nAfter the 1956 re-release, the film was sold to television (first being broadcast March 5, 1956).[63]\\r\\nRKO had failed to preserve copies of film's negative or release prints with the excised footage, and the cut scenes were considered lost for years. In 1969, a 16mm print, including the censored footage, was found in Philadelphia. The cut scenes were added to the film, restoring it to its original theatrical running time of 100 minutes. This version was re-released to art houses by Janus Films in 1970.[62]\\r\\nOver the next two decades, Universal Studios carried out further photochemical restoration on King Kong. This was based on a 1942 release print, with missing censor cuts taken from a 1937 print, which \\"contained heavy vertical scratches from projection.\\"[64] An original release print located in the UK in the 1980s was found to contain the cut scenes in better quality.\\r\\nAfter a 6-year worldwide search for the best surviving materials, a further, fully digital, restoration utilizing 4K resolution scanning was completed by Warner Bros. in 2005.[65] This restoration also had a 4-minute overture added, bringing the overall running time to 104 minutes. King Kong was also, somewhat controversially, colorized in the late 1980s for television.[66]\\r\\nIn 1984, King Kong was one of the first films to be released on LaserDisc by the Criterion Collection, and was the very first movie to have an audio commentary track included. Criterion's audio commentary was by film historian Ron Haver; in 1985 Image Entertainment released another LaserDisc, this time with a commentary by film historian and soundtrack producer Paul Mandell. Neither of these commentaries has since resurfaced on any other format.\\r\\nKing Kong had numerous VHS and LaserDisc releases of varying quality prior to receiving an official studio release on DVD. Those included a Turner 60th anniversary edition in 1993 featuring a front cover which had the sound effect of Kong roaring when his chest was pressed. It also included the colorized version of the film and a 25-minute documentary, It Was Beauty Killed the Beast (1992). The documentary is also available on two different UK King Kong DVDs, while the colorized version is available on DVD in the UK and Italy.[67] Warner Home Video re-released the black and white version on VHS with the 25-minute documentary included under the Warner Bros. Classics label in 1999.\\r\\nIn 2005 Warner Bros. released their digital restoration of King Kong in a US 2-disc Special Edition DVD, coinciding with the theatrical release of Peter Jackson's remake. It had numerous extra features, including a new, third audio commentary by visual effects artists Ray Harryhausen and Ken Ralston, with archival excerpts from actress Fay Wray and producer/director Merian C. Cooper. Warners issued identical DVDs in 2006 in Australia and New Zealand, followed by a US digibook-packaged Blu-ray in 2010.[68] In 2014 the Blu-ray was repackaged with three unrelated films in a 4 Film Favorites: Colossal Monster Collection.\\r\\nAt present, Universal holds worldwide rights to Kong's home video releases outside of the US, Australia and New Zealand. All Universal's releases only contain their earlier, 100 minute, pre-2005 restoration.[65]\\r\\nThe 1933 King Kong film and character inspired imitations and installments. Son of Kong, a direct sequel to the 1933 film was released nine months after the first film's release. In the early 1960s, RKO had licensed the King Kong character to Japanese studio Toho and produced two King Kong films, King Kong vs. Godzilla and King Kong Escapes, both directed by Ishir Honda.\\r\\nIn 1976, Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis released his version of King Kong, a modern remake of the 1933 film, which was followed by a sequel in 1986 titled King Kong Lives. In 2005, Universal Pictures released another remake of King Kong, directed by Peter Jackson. Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros. released a Kong reboot film titled Kong: Skull Island in 2017 which was directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts.\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nBibliography","input":"What was king kong's fur made out of?"},{"output":"Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin","context":"Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin (Russian: β?ҳ 쿹?־ ?ҷ[note 1]; IPA:?[?j?r??j ?l???ks?ej?v??t? ??ar??n]; 9 March 1934 ÿ 27 March 1968) was a Soviet pilot and cosmonaut. He was the first human to journey into outer space, when his Vostok spacecraft completed an orbit of the Earth on 12 April 1961.\\r\\nGagarin became an international celebrity, and was awarded many medals and titles, including Hero of the Soviet Union, the nation's highest honour. Vostok 1 marked his only spaceflight, but he served as backup crew to the Soyuz 1 mission (which ended in a fatal crash). Gagarin later became deputy training director of the Cosmonaut Training Centre outside Moscow, which was later named after him. Gagarin died in 1968 when the MiG-15 training jet he was piloting crashed. The Fdration Aronautique Internationale awards the Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal in his honor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYuri Gagarin was born in the village of Klushino, near Gzhatsk (renamed Gagarin in 1968 after his death), on 9 March 1934.[1] His parents worked on a collective farm.[2] His father, Alexei Ivanovich Gagarin was a carpenter and bricklayer, and his mother, Anna Timofeyevna Gagarina, was a milkmaid.[note 2][3] Yuri was the third of four children: older brother Valentin, older sister Zoya, and younger brother Boris.[4]\\r\\nLike millions of people in the Soviet Union, the Gagarin family suffered during Nazi occupation in World War II. Klushino was occupied in November 1941 during the German advance on Moscow, and an officer took over the Gagarin residence. The family was allowed to build a mud hut, approximately 3 by 3 metres (10 by 10?ft) inside, on the land behind their house, where they spent a year and nine months until the end of the occupation.[5] His two older siblings were deported by the Germans to Poland for slave labour in 1943, returning only after the war in 1945.[4][6] In 1946, the family moved to Gzhatsk, where Gagarin continued his secondary education.[5]\\r\\nIn 1950, Gagarin entered into an apprenticeship at age 16 as a foundryman at the Lyubertsy Steel Plant near Moscow,[4][6] and also enrolled at a local \\"young workers\\" school for seventh grade evening classes.[7] After graduating in 1951 from both the seventh grade and the vocational school (with honours in moldmaking and foundry-work),[7] he was selected for further training at the Saratov Industrial Technical School, where he studied tractors.[4][6][8] While in Saratov, Gagarin volunteered for weekend training as a Soviet air cadet at a local flying club, where he learned to fly  at first in a biplane and later in a Yak-18 trainer.[6][8] He also earned extra money as a part-time dock laborer on the Volga River.[5]\\r\\nAfter graduating from the technical school in 1955, the Soviet Army drafted Gagarin.[7] On a recommendation, Gagarin was sent to the First Chkalov Air Force Pilot's School in Orenburg, and soloed in a MiG-15 in 1957.[4][6][7] Post-graduation, he was assigned to the Luostari airbase in Murmansk Oblast, close to the Norwegian border, where terrible weather made flying risky. He became a Lieutenant in the Soviet Air Forces on 5 November 1957; on 6 November 1959 he received the rank of Senior Lieutenant.[9]\\r\\nIn 1960, after much searching and a selection process, Yuri Gagarin was chosen with 19 other pilots for the Soviet space program. Gagarin was further selected for an elite training group known as the Sochi Six, from which the first cosmonauts of the Vostok programme would be chosen. Gagarin and other prospective candidates were subjected to experiments designed to test physical and psychological endurance; he also underwent training for the upcoming flight. Out of the twenty selected, the eventual choices for the first launch were Gagarin and Gherman Titov due to their performance during training sessions as well as their physical characteristics? space was limited in the small Vostok cockpit, and both men were rather short. Gagarin was 1.57 metres (5?ft 2?in) tall.[2]\\r\\nIn August 1960, when Gagarin was one of 20 possible candidates, a Soviet Air Force doctor evaluated his personality as follows:\\r\\nModest; embarrasses when his humor gets a little too racy; high degree of intellectual development evident in Yuriy; fantastic memory; distinguishes himself from his colleagues by his sharp and far-ranging sense of attention to his surroundings; a well-developed imagination; quick reactions; persevering, prepares himself painstakingly for his activities and training exercises, handles celestial mechanics and mathematical formulae with ease as well as excels in higher mathematics; does not feel constrained when he has to defend his point of view if he considers himself right; appears that he understands life better than a lot of his friends.[10]\\r\\nGagarin was also a favoured candidate by his peers. When the 20 candidates were asked to anonymously vote for which other candidate they would like to see as the first to fly, all but three chose Gagarin.[11] One of these candidates, Yevgeny Khrunov, believed that Gagarin was very focused, and was demanding of himself and others when necessary.[12]\\r\\nGagarin kept physically fit throughout his life, and was a keen sportsman. Cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky wrote:\\r\\nService in the Air Force made us strong, both physically and morally. All of us cosmonauts took up sports and PT seriously when we served in the Air Force. I know that Yuri Gagarin was fond of ice hockey. He liked to play goal keeper... I don't think I am wrong when I say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts.[13]\\r\\nIn addition to being a keen ice hockey player, Gagarin was also a basketball fan, and coached the Saratov Industrial Technical School team, as well as being a referee.[14]\\r\\nOn 12 April 1961, the Vostok 3KA-3 (Vostok 1) spacecraft with Gagarin aboard was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. Gagarin thus became both the first human to travel into space, and the first to orbit the Earth. His call sign was Kedr (Russian: 椿, Siberian pine or Cedar).[15]\\r\\nThe radio communication between the launch control room and Gagarin included the following dialogue at the moment of rocket launch:\\r\\nKorolev: \\"Preliminary stage..... intermediate..... main..... lift off! We wish you a good flight. Everything is all right.\\"\\r\\nGagarin: \\"楾!\\" (Poyekhali!Let's go!).[16]\\r\\nGagarin's informal poyekhali! became a historical phrase in the Eastern Bloc, used to refer to the beginning of the Space Age in human history.[17][18]\\r\\nIn his post-flight report, Gagarin recalled his experience of spaceflight, having been the first human in space:\\r\\nThe feeling of weightlessness was somewhat unfamiliar compared with Earth conditions. Here, you feel as if you were hanging in a horizontal position in straps. You feel as if you are suspended.[19]\\r\\nFollowing the flight, Gagarin told the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that during reentry he had whistled the tune \\"The Motherland Hears, The Motherland Knows\\" (Russian: \\"˾ҷ ְ, ˾ҷ \\").[20][21] The first two lines of the song are: \\"The Motherland hears, the Motherland knows/Where her son flies in the sky\\".[22] This patriotic song was written by Dmitri Shostakovich in 1951 (opus 86), with words by Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky.\\r\\nSome sources have claimed that Gagarin commented during the flight, \\"I don't see any God up here.\\" However, no such words appear in the verbatim record of his conversations with Earth-based stations during the spaceflight.[23] In a 2006 interview, Gagarin's friend Colonel Valentin Petrov stated that the cosmonaut never said such words, and that the quote originated from Nikita Khrushchev's speech at the plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU about the state's anti-religion campaign, saying \\"Gagarin flew into space, but didn't see any god there.\\"[24] Petrov also said that Gagarin had been baptised into the Orthodox Church as a child, and a 2011 Foma magazine article quoted the rector of the Orthodox church in Star City saying, \\"Gagarin baptized his elder daughter Yelena shortly before his space flight; and his family used to celebrate Christmas and Easter and keep icons in the house.\\"[25]\\r\\nGagarin's flight was a triumph for the Soviet space program. The announcement on the Soviet radio was made by Yuri Levitan, the same speaker who announced all major events in the Great Patriotic War. Gagarin became a national hero of the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc, and a worldwide celebrity. Newspapers around the globe published his biography and details of his flight. Moscow and other cities in the USSR held mass demonstrations, the scale of which was second only to World War II Victory Parades. Gagarin was escorted in a long motorcade of high-ranking officials through the streets of Moscow to the Kremlin where, in a lavish ceremony, he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, by Nikita Khrushchev.[26]\\r\\nLater on, Gagarin toured widely abroad. He visited Italy, Germany, Canada, Brazil, Japan, Egypt[27] and Finland to promote the Soviet Union's accomplishment of putting the first human in space. He visited the United Kingdom three months after the Vostok 1 mission, going to London and Manchester.[28][29]\\r\\nThe sudden rise to fame took its toll on Gagarin. While acquaintances say Gagarin had been a \\"sensible drinker\\", his touring schedule placed him in social situations where he was always expected to drink. Gagarin was also reportedly caught by his wife in a room with another woman, a nurse named Anna who had aided him after a boating incident earlier in the day, at a Black Sea resort in September 1961. He attempted to escape by leaving through a window and jumping off her second floor balcony, hitting his face on a kerbstone and leaving a permanent scar above his left eyebrow.[4][8]\\r\\nIn 1962, he began serving as a Deputy to the Soviet of the Union,[30] and was elected to the Central Committee of the Young Communist League. He later returned to Star City, the cosmonaut facility, where he spent several years working on designs for a reusable spacecraft. He became a lieutenant colonel of the Soviet Air Forces on 12 June 1962, and received the rank of colonel on 6 November 1963.[9] Soviet officials tried to keep him away from any flights, being worried of losing their hero in an accident. Gagarin was backup pilot for his friend Vladimir Komarov in the Soyuz 1 flight, which was launched despite Gagarin's protests that additional safety precautions were necessary.[31] When Komarov's flight ended in a fatal crash, Gagarin was permanently banned from training for and participating in further spaceflights.\\r\\nOn 20 December 1963, Gagarin had become Deputy Training Director of the Star City cosmonaut training base.[32] Two years later he was re-elected as a deputy to the SSSU, but this time to the Soviet of Nationalities.[30] Next year he began to re-qualify as a fighter pilot.[33] On 17 February 1968, he successfully defended his aerospace engineering thesis on the subject of spaceplane aerodynamic configuration, passing with flying colors.[34][35]\\r\\nOn 27 March 1968, while on a routine training flight from Chkalovsky Air Base, he and flight instructor Vladimir Seryogin died in a MiG-15UTI crash near the town of Kirzhach. The bodies of Gagarin and Seryogin were cremated and the ashes were buried in the walls of the Kremlin on Red Square.\\r\\nGagarin is survived by his wife Valentina, and daughters Yelena and Galina.\\r\\nThe cause of the crash that killed Gagarin is not entirely certain, and has been subject to speculation about conspiracy theories over the ensuing decades.\\r\\nSoviet documents declassified in March 2003 showed that the KGB had conducted their own investigation of the accident, in addition to one government and two military investigations. The KGB's report dismissed various conspiracy theories, instead indicating that the actions of airbase personnel contributed to the crash. The report states that an air traffic controller provided Gagarin with outdated weather information, and that by the time of his flight, conditions had deteriorated significantly. Ground crew also left external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft. Gagarin's planned flight activities needed clear weather and no outboard tanks. The investigation concluded that Gagarin's aircraft entered a spin, either due to a bird strike or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft. Because of the out-of-date weather report, the crew believed their altitude to be higher than it actually was, and could not react properly to bring the MiG-15 out of its spin.[36]\\r\\nAnother hypothesis, advanced by the original crash investigator in 2005, hypothesizes that a cabin air vent was accidentally left open by the crew or the previous pilot, leading to oxygen deprivation and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft.[37] A similar hypothesis, published in Air & Space magazine, is that the crew detected the open vent and followed procedure by executing a rapid dive to a lower altitude. This dive caused them to lose consciousness and crash.[38]\\r\\nOn 12 April 2007, the Kremlin vetoed a new investigation into the death of Gagarin. Government officials said that they saw no reason to begin a new investigation.[39]\\r\\nIn April 2011, documents from a 1968 commission set up by the Central Committee of the Communist Party to investigate the accident were declassified. Those documents revealed that the commission's original conclusion was that Gagarin or Seryogin had maneuvered sharply either to avoid a weather balloon, leading the jet into a \\"super-critical flight regime and to its stalling in complex meteorological conditions,\\" or to avoid \\"entry into the upper limit of the first layer of cloud cover\\".[40]\\r\\nIn his 2004 book Two Sides of the Moon, Alexey Leonov, who was part of a State Commission established to investigate the death in 1968, recounts that he was flying a helicopter in the same area that day when he heard \\"two loud booms in the distance.\\" Corroborating other hypotheses, his conclusion is that a Sukhoi jet (which he identifies as a Su-15 'Flagon') was flying below its minimum allowed altitude, and \\"without realizing it because of the terrible weather conditions, he passed within 10 or 20 meters of Yuri and Seregin's plane while breaking the sound barrier.\\" The resulting turbulence would have sent the MiG into an uncontrolled spin. Leonov believes the first boom he heard was that of the jet breaking the sound barrier, and the second was Gagarin's plane crashing.[41] In a June 2013 interview with Russian television network RT, Leonov said that a declassified report on the incident revealed the presence of a second, \\"unauthorized\\" Su-15 flying in the area. Leonov states that this aircraft had descended to 450 metres (1,480?ft) and that, while running afterburners, \\"the aircraft reduced its echelon at a distance of 10ÿ15 meters in the clouds, passing close to Gagarin, turning his plane and thus sending it into a tailspin ÿ a deep spiral, to be precise ÿ at a speed of 750 kilometers per hour.\\" As a condition of being allowed to discuss the report, however, Leonov was required to not disclose the name of the other pilot, who was reported to be 80 years old (as of 2013) and in poor health.[42][43]\\r\\nIn 1957, while at the First Chkalov Air Force Pilot's School in Orenburg, Gagarin met Valentina Ivanovna Goryacheva,[3] a medical technician graduate of the Orenburg Medical School.[6][8] They were married on 7 November 1957, the same day Gagarin graduated from Orenburg, and they have two daughters.[3][6]\\r\\nYelena Yurievna Gagarina is an art historian who has worked as the Director-General of the Moscow Kremlin Museums since 2001.[44][45]\\r\\nGalina Yurievna Gagarina is a professor of economics and the department chair at Plekhanov Russian University of Economics in Moscow.[44][46]\\r\\nAside from his short stature at 1.57 metres (5?ft 2?in), one of Gagarin's most notable traits was his smile.[47] Many commented on how Gagarin's smile gained the attention of crowds on the frequent tours he did in the months after the Vostok 1 mission success.[29]\\r\\nGagarin also garnered a reputation as an adept public figure. When he visited Manchester in the United Kingdom, it was pouring rain. However, Gagarin insisted that the convertible top remain down so that the cheering crowds could catch a glimpse of him. Gagarin stated, \\"If all these people have turned out to welcome me and can stand in the rain, so can I.\\" Gagarin refused an umbrella and remained standing in his open-top Bentley so that the cheering crowds could still see him.[29]\\r\\nSergei Korolev, one of the masterminds behind the early years of the Soviet space program, later said that Gagarin possessed a smile \\"that lit up the Cold War\\".[48]\\r\\n12 April, the date of Gagarin's space flight, has been commemorated as a special date. Since 1962, it has been celebrated in the USSR and later in Russia and other post-Soviet states as the Cosmonautics Day. In 2011 it was declared the International Day of Human Space Flight by the United Nations.[49]\\r\\nSince 2001, Yuri's Night, an international celebration, is held every 12 April to commemorate milestones in space exploration.\\r\\nA number of buildings and other sites on Earth have been named for Gagarin. The Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City was named in 1969. The launch pad at Baikonur Cosmodrome from which Sputnik 1 and Vostok 1 were launched, is now known as Gagarin's Start. Gagarin Raion in the Sevastopol city (Ukraine) was named after him during the period of the Soviet Union. The Air Force Academy was renamed Gagarin Air Force Academy in 1968.\\r\\nGagarin has been honored on the Moon by both astronauts and astronomers. He was honored by the American space program during Apollo 11 in 1969 when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin left a memorial satchel containing medals commemorating Gagarin and fellow cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov on the surface.[50][51] In 1971, Apollo 15 astronauts David Scott and James Irwin left the Fallen Astronaut at their landing site as a memorial to all the American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts who died in the Space Race, with Yuri Gagarin listed among 14 others.[52][53] He is memorialized by the official naming of a 265?km crater on the Far Side after him.\\r\\nSeveral statues have been erected in his honor.\\r\\nOn 4 June 1980, a monument to Gagarin was opened on Gagarin Square in Leninsky Avenue, Moscow. The monument is 42.4 m tall and constructed of titanium. Beside the column is a replica of the descent module used by Gagarin.\\r\\nIn 2011 a statue, Yuri Gagarin, was unveiled at the Admiralty Arch end of The Mall in London, opposite the permanent sculpture of James Cook. It is a copy of the statue outside Gagarin's former school in Lyubertsy.[54] In 2013 the statue was moved to a permanent location outside the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.[55]\\r\\nIn 2012, a statue was unveiled at the site of NASA's original spaceflight headquarters on South Wayside Drive in Houston. The sculpture, completed in 2011 by artist/cosmonaut Alexsei Leonov, was a gift to Houston by various Russian organisations. Houston Mayor Annise Parker, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were present for the dedication.[56]\\r\\nGagarin is memorialized in music, including a cycle of Soviet patriotic songs The Constellation Gagarin (Russian: Ѿ־ҿ ҷ, tr. Sozvezdie Gagarina) was written by Alexandra Pakhmutova and Nikolai Dobronravov in 1970ÿ1971.[57] The most famous of these songs referred to Gagarin's poekhali!: He said \\"let's go!\\" He waved his hand.[17][57] He was the inspiration for the pieces \\"Hey Gagarin\\" by Jean Michel Jarre (on Mtamorphoses), \\"Gagarin\\" by Public Service Broadcasting, and \\"Gagarin, I loved you\\" by Undervud.\\r\\nVessels have been named for him. Soviet tracking ship Kosmonavt Yuri Gagarin was built in 1971. Armenian airline Armavia named their first Sukhoi Superjet 100 in Gagarin's honour in 2011.[58]\\r\\nThere were two commemorative coins issued in the Soviet Union to honour the 20th and 30th anniversaries of his flight: 1 ruble coin (1981, copper-nickel) and 3 ruble coin (1991, silver). In 2001, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Gagarin's flight, a series of four coins bearing his likeness was issued in Russia: 2 ruble coin (copper-nickel), 3 ruble coin (silver), 10 ruble coin (brass-copper, nickel), and 100 ruble coin (silver).[59] In 2011, Russia issued a 1,000 ruble coin (gold) and 3 ruble coin (silver) to mark the 50th anniversary of his flight.[60]\\r\\nIn 2008, the Kontinental Hockey League named their championship trophy the Gagarin Cup.[61] In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Gagarin was ranked as the #6 most popular space hero, tied with Star Trek's fictional Capt. James T. Kirk.[62] The Russian docudrama, Gagarin: First in Space, was released in 2013.\\r\\nThe 50th anniversary of Gagarin's journey into space was marked in 2011 by tributes around the world. A film titled First Orbit was shot from the International Space Station, combining the original flight audio with footage of the route taken by Gagarin.[63] The Russian, American, and Italian Expedition 27 crew aboard the ISS sent a special video message to wish the people of the world a \\"Happy Yuri's Night\\", wearing shirts with an image of Gagarin.[64]\\r\\nSwiss-based German watchmaker Bernhard Lederer created a limited edition of 50 Gagarin Tourbillons to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight.[65]\\r\\nThe launch of Soyuz TMA-21 on 4 April 2011 was devoted to the 50th anniversary of the first manned space mission.[66]\\r\\nand others.\\r\\nYuri Gagarin was elected an honorary citizen of the following cities:\\r\\nHe was also awarded the golden keys to the gates of the Egyptian cities Cairo and Alexandria.","input":"Who was the first person went to space?"},{"output":"Western Front","context":"","input":"What was the front line trench in ww1?"},{"output":"Arthur Andersen","context":"The Big Four are the four largest professional services networks in the world, offering audit, assurance services, taxation, management consulting, advisory, actuarial, corporate finance and legal services. They handle the vast majority of audits for public companies as well as many private companies. It is reported that the Big Four audit 99% of the companies in the FTSE 100, and 96% of the companies in the FTSE 250 Index, an index of the leading mid-cap listing companies.[1] The Big Four firms are shown below, with their latest publicly available data.\\r\\nThis group was once known as the \\"Big Eight\\", and was reduced to the \\"Big Six\\" and then \\"Big Five\\" by a series of mergers. The Big Five became the Big Four after the fall of Arthur Andersen in 2002, following its involvement in the Enron scandal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNone of the Big Four firms is a single firm; rather, they are professional services networks. Each is a network of firms, owned and managed independently, which have entered into agreements with other member firms in the network to share a common name, brand and quality standards. Each network has established an entity to co-ordinate the activities of the network. In one case (KPMG), the co-ordinating entity is Dutch, and in three cases (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young) the co-ordinating entity is a UK limited company. Those entities do not themselves perform external professional services and do not own or control the member firms. They are similar to law firm networks found in the legal profession.\\r\\nIn many cases each member firm practices in a single country, and is structured to comply with the regulatory environment in that country. In 2007, KPMG announced a merger of four member firms (in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein) to form a single firm.\\r\\nErnst & Young also includes separate legal entities which manage three of its four areas: the Americas, EMEIA (Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa), and Asia-Pacific. (Note: the Japan area does not have a separate area management entity.) These firms coordinate services performed by local firms within their respective areas but do not perform services or hold ownership in the local entities.[6]\\r\\nThe figures in this article refer to the combined revenues of each network of firms.\\r\\nSince 1989, mergers and one major scandal involving Arthur Andersen have reduced the number of major professional-services firms from eight to four.\\r\\nThe firms were called the Big Eight for most of the 20th century, reflecting the international dominance of the eight largest firms (presented here in alphabetical order):\\r\\nMost of the Big Eight originated in an alliance formed between British and U.S. audit firms in the 19th or early 20th centuries. Price Waterhouse was a UK firm which opened a U.S. office in 1890 and subsequently established a separate U.S. partnership. The UK and U.S. Peat Marwick Mitchell firms adopted a common name in 1925. Other firms used separate names for domestic business, and did not adopt common names until much later: Touche Ross in 1960, Arthur Young (at first Arthur Young, McLelland Moores) in 1968, Coopers & Lybrand in 1973, Deloitte Haskins & Sells in 1978 and Ernst & Whinney in 1979.[9]\\r\\nThe firms' initial international expansion was driven by the needs of British and U.S.-based multinationals for worldwide service. They expanded by forming local partnerships or by forming alliances with local firms.\\r\\nArthur Andersen had a different history. The firm originated in the United States, and expanded internationally by establishing its own offices in other markets, including the United Kingdom.\\r\\nIn the 1980s the Big 8, each now with global branding, adopted modern marketing and grew rapidly. They merged with many smaller firms. One of the largest of these mergers was in 1987, when Peat Marwick merged with the Klynveld Main Goerdeler (KMG) group to become KPMG Peat Marwick, later known simply as KPMG.\\r\\nCompetition among these firms intensified and the Big?8 became the Big?Six in 1989 when Ernst & Whinney merged with Arthur Young to form Ernst & Young in June, and Deloitte, Haskins & Sells merged with Touche Ross to form Deloitte & Touche in August.\\r\\nConfusingly, in the United Kingdom the local firm of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells merged instead with Coopers & Lybrand. For some years after the merger, the merged firm was called Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte and the local firm of Touche Ross kept its original name. In the mid 1990s however, both UK firms changed their names to match those of their respective international organizations. On the other hand, in Australia the local firm of Touche Ross merged instead with KPMG.[10][11] It is for these reasons that the Deloitte & Touche international organization was known as DRT International (later DTT International), to avoid use of names which would have been ambiguous (as well as contested) in certain markets.\\r\\nThe Big 6 became the Big?Five in July 1998 when Price Waterhouse merged with Coopers & Lybrand to form PricewaterhouseCoopers.\\r\\nThe Big 5 Accounting Firms were:[12]\\r\\nThe Enron collapse and ensuing investigation prompted scrutiny of their financial reporting, which was audited by Arthur Andersen. Arthur Andersen was eventually indicted for obstruction of justice for shredding documents related to the audit in the 2001 Enron scandal. The resulting conviction, though later overturned, still effectively meant the end for Arthur Andersen. Most of its country practices around the world have been sold to members of what is now the Big Fournotably Ernst & Young globally; Deloitte & Touche in the UK, Canada, Spain, and Brazil; and PricewaterhouseCoopers (now known as PwC) in China and Hong Kong.\\r\\nIn 2010 Deloitte with its 1.8% growth was able to beat PricewaterhouseCoopers with its 1.5% growth to gain first place and become the largest firm in the industry. In 2011, PwC re-gained the first place with 10% revenue growth. In 2013, these two firms still claim the top two spots with only $200 million or 0.5% revenue difference. However, Deloitte has seen faster growth than PwC over the last few years (largely due to acquisitions) and reclaimed the title of largest of the Big Four in Fiscal Year 2016.\\r\\nIt was estimated that the Big Four had about 67 per cent share of the global accountancy market in 2012 while the rest were divided amongst so-called mid-tier players, including Grant Thornton and BDO.[13]\\r\\nA year at the end indicates year of formation through merger or adoption of single brand name.\\r\\nAccording to Australian taxation expert George Rozvany, the Big Four are \\"the masterminds of multinational tax avoidance and the architects of tax schemes which cost governments and their taxpayers an estimated $US1 trillion a year\\". At the same time they are advising governments on tax reforms, they are advising their multinational clients how to avoid taxes.[14][15]\\r\\nIn the wake of industry concentration and individual firm failure, the issue of a credible alternative industry structure has been raised.[16] The limiting factor on the growth of additional firms is that although some of the firms in the next tier have become quite substantial, and have formed international networks, effectively all very large public companies insist on having a \\"Big Four\\" audit, so the smaller firms have no way to grow into the top end of the market.\\r\\nDocuments published in June 2010 show that some UK companies' banking covenants required them to use one of the Big Four. This approach from the lender prevents firms in the next tier from competing for audit work for such companies. The British Bankers' Association said that such clauses are rare.[17] Current discussions in the UK consider outlawing such clauses.\\r\\nIn 2011,The UK House of Lords completed an inquiry into the financial crisis, and called for an Office of Fair Trading investigation into the dominance of the Big Four.[18] It is reported that the Big Four audit all but one of the companies that constitute the FTSE 100, and 240 of the companies in the FTSE 250, an index of the leading mid-cap listing companies.[1]\\r\\nIn Ireland, the Director of Corporate Enforcement, in February 2011 said, auditors \\"report surprisingly few types of company law offences to us\\", with the so-called \\"big four\\" auditing firms reporting the least often to his office, at just 5pc of all reports.[19]\\r\\nEY Bangladesh\\r\\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Kyoto","input":"Who were the original big 8 accounting firms?"},{"output":"seven","context":"Age of Empires is a series of personal computer games originally developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft Studios. The first title of the series was Age of Empires, released in 1997. Since then, seven titles and three spin-offs have been released. The titles are historical real-time strategy games.\\r\\nAge of Empires focused on events in Europe, Africa and Asia, spanning from the Stone Age to the Iron Age; the expansion game explored the formation and expansion of the Roman Empire. The sequel, Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, was set in the Middle Ages, while its expansion focused partially on the Spanish conquest of Mexico. The subsequent three games of Age of Empires III explored the early modern period, when Europe was colonizing the Americas and several Asian nations were on the decline. The newest installment, Age of Empires Online, takes a different approach as a free-to-play online game utilizing Games for Windows Live. A spin-off game, Age of Mythology, was set in the same period as the original Age of Empires, but focused on mythological elements of Greek, Egyptian, and Norse mythology. At Gamescom 2017, Microsoft announced the fourth installment of the series, Age of Empires IV as well as Definitive Editions for Age of Empires II and Age of Empires III.\\r\\nThe Age of Empires series has been a commercial success, selling over 20 million copies.[1] Critics have credited part of the success of the series to its historical theme and fair play; the artificial intelligence (AI) players fight with fewer advantages than in many of the series' competitors.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe games in the series focus on historical events throughout time. Age of Empires covers the events between the Stone Age and the Classical period, in Europe and Asia. Its expansion, The Rise of Rome, follows the formation and rise of the Roman Empire. The Age of Kings and its Nintendo DS spin-off follow Europe and Asia through the Middle Ages. The Age of Kings' expansion pack, The Conquerors, is set during the same period, but also includes scenarios about the Spanish conquest of Mexico, El Cid, and Attila the Hun. Age of Empires III and its first expansion, The WarChiefs, take place during the European colonization of the Americas. Its second expansion, The Asian Dynasties, follows the rise of Asia in the same period. Age of Empires Online focuses on the Greek and Egyptian civilizations. The series' spin-off, Age of Mythology, and its expansion pack, The Titans, are set during the Bronze Age, but focus on mythology as their themes, rather than history.\\r\\nAge of Empires, released on October 26, 1997,[3] was the first game in the series, as well as the first major release from Ensemble Studios.[4] It was one of the first history-based real-time strategy games made,[5] utilizing the Genie game engine. GameSpot described it as a mix of Civilization and Warcraft.[6] The game gives players a choice of 12 civilizations to develop from the Stone Age to the Iron Age. The expansion pack, The Rise of Rome, published by Microsoft on October 31, 1998, introduced new features and four new civilizations, including the Romans. Although the two games had contained many software bugs, patches resolved many of the problems.[7][8]\\r\\nAge of Empires was generally well received, despite some highly negative reviews. GameSpot criticized a confused design, while Computer and Video Games praised the game as strong in single and multiplayer.[9] The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences named Age of Empires the 1998 \\"Computer Strategy Game of the Year.\\"[10] For several years, the game remained high on the sales charts, with over three million units sold by 2000.[11] The Rise of Rome sold one million units in 2000[11] and attained 80% as an aggregate score from GameRankings.[12]\\r\\nIn June 2017, Adam Isgreen, creative director of Microsoft Studios announced Age of Empires: Definitive Edition at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017. It will feature overhauled graphics with support for 4K resolution, a remastered soundtrack, and other gameplay improvements, and was planned to be released on October 19, 2017.[13][14] On October 13, it was announced that the release date of the Definitive Edition would be postponed until early 2018.[15]\\r\\nAge of Empires II: The Age of Kings, released on September 30, 1999, used the Genie game engine, and had gameplay similar to its predecessor.[16] Age of Kings is set in the Middle Ages, from the Dark Ages to the Imperial Age. It allows players to choose one of 13 civilizations, from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.[17]\\r\\nOn August 24, 2000, Microsoft published the expansion, The Conquerors. It added new units and five new civilizations, including two Mesoamerican civilizations; the Maya and the Aztec.[18] The Age of Kings was a bigger critical success than the first two games, with Game Rankings and Metacritic scores of 92%.[19][20] Microsoft shipped out more than two million copies to retailers, and the game received numerous awards and accolades.[21] Critics agreed that The Conquerors expanded well on The Age of Kings, though issues of unbalanced gameplay were raised.[22] The Age of Kings and The Conquerors won the 2000 and 2001 \\"Computer Strategy Game of the Year\\" awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, respectively.[23][24]\\r\\nIn April 2013, Age of Empires II: HD Edition was released on the Steam digital distribution platform for Windows operating systems. The HD Edition includes both the original game and the expansion The Conquerors, as well as updated graphics for high-resolution displays.[25] In November 2013, a second expansion entitled The Forgotten was released by Microsoft exclusively for the HD Edition.[26] A third expansion named The African Kingdoms was released by Microsoft in November 2015, also exclusively for the HD Edition.[27] A fourth expansion entitled Rise of the Rajas was released on 19 December 2016.[28] On August 21, 2017, Microsoft announced Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition.[29]\\r\\nAge of Empires III, released on October 18, 2005, was built on an improved version of the Age of Mythology game engine with the most significant changes being the updated graphics engine and the inclusion of the Havok physics middleware engine.[30][31] The game is set in the period between 1421 and 1850, and players can choose one of eight European nations. The game introduced a large number of features, such as home cities. Described by Ensemble Studios as \\"an important support system to your efforts in the New World,\\" home cities helped provide the player with resources, equipment, troops, and upgrades. They could be used across multiple games, and upgraded after each battle; it was compared to a role-playing game character by Ensemble Studios.[32] The first expansion to Age of Empires III, The WarChiefs, was released October 17, 2006. Most gameplay changes in the expansion pack were small, but it introduced three new civilizations, with a focus on Native Americans.[33] Most notable was the introduction of the WarChief unit.[34] The second expansion, The Asian Dynasties, went on sale October 23, 2007. It was a jointly developed product; Big Huge Games helped Ensemble Studios develop the game, with Brian Reynolds joining Bruce Shelley as lead designer.[35] The game expanded the Age of Empires III universe into Asia, and introduced three new civilizations.[36] Reception towards Age of Empires III was mixed; Game Revolution described it as \\"about as much fun\\" as a history textbook, while GameZone argued it was \\"one of the best looking games, much less an RTS game, that is out on the market currently\\".[37] It sold more than two million copies, and won the GameSpy \\"real-time strategy game of the year\\" award.[38][39] The WarChiefs failed to equal the success of its predecessor, with a lower score on both Game Rankings and Metacritic, and The Asian Dynasties' score was lower still with 80%.[40][41][42][43]\\r\\nSeveral collectors' editions of Age of Empires III included a hardcover artbook. The last page of the artbook has a pictorial depiction of the series; the Roman numerals below each panel range from I to V, indicating the series would include an Age of Empires IV and Age of Empires V. Ensemble Studios employee Sandy Petersen said that the image \\"was total speculation on [their] part.\\"[44]\\r\\nIn 2008, Microsoft announced they were closing down Ensemble Studios following the completion of Halo Wars. Some of its employees would form a new team as part of Microsoft Studios.[45] Kevin Unangst, director of Games for Windows, denied it was the end of the Age of Empires series, telling The San Francisco Chronicle \\"we're very excited about the future potential for Age of Empires\\".[46] Edge confirmed, in an interview with Microsoft's corporate vice president of interactive entertainment, Shane Kim, that Microsoft continued to own Age of Empires and that they had plans to continue the series.[47] However, Bruce Shelley wrote in his blog that he would not be part of any new studios formed.[48][49]\\r\\nOn August 21, 2017, Microsoft announced Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition.[29]\\r\\nOn August 21, 2017, Microsoft announced Age of Empires IV, developed by Relic Entertainment.[50]\\r\\nAge of Mythology shared many elements of gameplay with the main series,[51] and was considered a part of the series, despite its different focus.[52][53] The campaign in Age of Mythology tells the story of an Atlantean, Arkantos, and his quest to find why his people are out of favor with Poseidon.[54] Microsoft published the game on October 30, 2002,[55] and its expansion, The Titans, on October 21, 2003.[56] The Titans featured the Atlanteans as a new civilization.[57] Its campaign is shorter than previous expansions, and centers on Kastor, son of Arkantos, who falls for the lies of the titans and frees them from Tartarus.[58] Age of Mythology sold more than one million units in four months.[59] It scored 89% on Game Rankings and Metacritic.[60][61] The Titans failed to equal the sales success of Age of Mythology, although critics rated it highly.[62][63]\\r\\nBackbone Entertainment developed Age of Empires: The Age of Kings as a turn-based game for the Nintendo DS. Majesco Entertainment published the game on February 14, 2006. It is similar to other turn-based games, such as Advance Wars, but with a gameplay based on its PC counterpart.[64] Age of Empires: The Age of Kings scored 80% on Game Rankings and Metacritic.[65][66] Konami brought a game of the same title to the PlayStation 2 around five years earlier than the DS version, but the game had little promotion, and sold poorly.[67]\\r\\nOn August 16, 2010, Microsoft announced Age of Empires Online, which was a free-to-play Games for Windows Live online game, it developed in collaboration with Robot Entertainment. It featured Free-to-play experiences via Games for Windows LIVE as well as: A persistent online capital city that lives and grows even when you're offline, Cooperative multiplayer quests, trading and a level-based system that lets you progress at your own pace.[68] Premium content could be earned or purchased, such as access to blueprints and special items, as well as more quests and features. In September 2013, it was announced that the game would remain functional until July 1, 2014, after which it would be shut down due to the content being too expensive to maintain.[69]\\r\\nOn April 13, 2014, Age of Empires: World Domination was announced. It was developed by KLab Games for the iOS, Android and Windows Phone.[70] It was released on December 7, 2015,[71] with the service terminated on 30 November 2016.[72]\\r\\nOn August 25, 2014, Age of Empires: Castle Siege was announced. It is a touch-based game developed by Smoking Gun Interactive. It was released on September 17, 2014 for the Windows PC and Windows Phone 8.[73][74]\\r\\nThe development phases of the Age of Empires games were similar in several ways. Due to the games being based on historical events, the team often had to do large amounts of research.[75] However, the research was not in depth, which, according to Age of Empires designer Bruce Shelley, is \\"a good idea for most entertainment products.\\"[75] Shelley also said that Ensemble Studios took most of the reference material from children's sections at libraries. He pointed out the goal was for the players of the game to have fun, \\"not [its] designers or researchers.\\"[75] At the Games Convention Developers Conference in 2007, Shelley continued with this thought and explained that the success of the series laid in \\"making a game which appealed to both the casual and hardcore gamer.\\"[76] Shelley also remarked the Age of Empires games were not about history in itself, but rather \\"about the human experience;\\"[76] they focused not simply on what humans had done but on what they could do in the future such as \\"going into space.\\"[76] Ensemble Studios developed Age of Mythology in a different way than the previous two games. The team had worried they \\"couldn't get away\\" with a third historical-based game, and chose mythology as the setting after they had discussed several options.[77]\\r\\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) used in the Age of Empires series has been developed and improved regularly by designers. AI specialist Dave Pottinger noted the development team gave the AI in the original game a very high priority, and spent over a year working on it. He said that the AI in the game relies on tactics and strategies to win, instead of \\"cheating\\" by giving bonus resources to itself, or tweaking its units to be stronger than normal.[2] Pottinger later noted that the Age of Empires series team took great pride in their AI playing a \\"fair game\\".[78]\\r\\nAge of Empires allows players to choose to play either along specialized, story-backed conditions or as individual battles against the AI (and other players). Choosing to battle against the AI ÿ rather than following the storyline ÿ allows the AI to adapt to players' strategies and even remember which games it won and lost. The AI eventually overcomes players' strategies and easily destroys their villages after several games. For instance, in Age of Empires III, this is referred to as playing a \\"Skirmish.\\" However Age of Empires III allows players to refine their strategies further against the AI by \\"Building a Deck,\\" which allows players to replace \\"Home City\\" shipments with improved alternatives.\\r\\nIn Age of Empires II: The Conquerors the AI was given a high priority, the result being the \\"smart villager\\" feature, which was included in subsequent games of the series. After building a structure that stores or produces resources, smart villagers would proceed to collect resources related to the structure, such as crops from farms or ore from exposed deposits.[79]\\r\\nAge of Mythology: The Titans lets players use an AI debugger when creating custom scenarios; players can change the settings of computer players and make them act according to certain patterns.[80] More basic changes to the AI had previously been available in the series' first two games.[81]\\r\\nThe graphics and visuals of Age of Empires improved with each successive release. From the original release to the second, Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, noteworthy improvements gained praise from several critics.[82][83][84] With the release of Age of Mythology the praise continued,[82][85][86][87] and the fourth release, Age of Empires III, garnered even more.[88][89][90]\\r\\nGameSpot praised the improved graphics[82] in the second release, Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. Eurogamer welcomed its introduction of female villagers[91] as compared with the original male only version. Allgame praised the advanced grouping and path-finding systems in the second release.[83] Despite the improved graphics, Allgame complained that units in Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings were at times difficult to distinguish from one another,[83] a point numerous reviewers agreed on.[82][92] Nevertheless, Game Revolution wrote that the second release was \\"the best looking of the 2D RTS games out there right now.\\"[84]\\r\\nThe graphics continued to improve in Age of Mythology and was praised by a majority of reviewers. IGN ranked the graphics in this third release, \\"a joy to watch ... awesome.\\"[85] GameSpot assented, also rating the graphics a 9 out of 10.[82] Game Revolution agreed,[86] and PC Gamer stated that the graphics in the third release \\"are packed with detail.\\"[87]\\r\\nThe trend in improved graphics continued well into the next release, Age of Empires III, much to the delight of reviewers. IGN stated, \\"After seeing the screenshots, our jaws hit the floor at the amount of detail.\\"[88] 1UP.com described Age of Empires III as \\"one of the most beautiful games you will put on your computer for the foreseeable future.\\"[89] GameSpy agreed, stating, \\"Age III's graphics are unmatched in the strategy genre.\\"[90] Age of Empires III builds on and introduces new features to the prior release, Age of Mythology, such as the inclusion of the award-winning[93] Havok physics simulation middleware[94] game engine for the Windows version and PhysX for the Mac OS X. The innovative result is that pre-created animations are avoided; instead events are calculated according to the physics engine. Consequently, views of events like building destruction and tree felling are not pre-recorded. GameSpot also admired the graphics in the fourth release but complained about \\"the awkward unit behavior.\\"[95] Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for pixel shader 3.0.[96]\\r\\nGameSpy awarded Age of Empires III the \\"Best Graphics\\" award at GameSpy's \\"Game of the Year 2005.\\"[97]\\r\\nStephen Rippy has been the series' music director since the first game. He has had occasional help from his brother, David Rippy, as well as Kevin McMullan.[98] He created the original music in Age of Empires with sounds of instruments from the periods in the game.[99] These sounds came from actual instruments, and their digital samples.[99] The tunes were the result of extensive research on the cultures, styles, and instruments used.[99] Rippy said that sound development on The Age of Kings was easy, since there was knowledge of the instruments used in the Middle Ages. Therefore, they were able to reproduce the tunes for the soundtrack of the game.[100] In Age of Mythology, an orchestral instrumentation was used, instead. According to McMullan, the team also collected large numbers of audio recordings from zoos, and created \\"a massive sound library of [their] own material.\\"[101] The music of Age of Empires III was similar to The Age of Kings, in which the team used more historical instruments; Rippy noted the team used instruments such as \\"bagpipes and field drums\\" to give it a realistic feel.[98]\\r\\nEnsemble Studios worked together with Big Huge Games to develop The Asian Dynasties, Age of Empires III's second expansion. This was the first joint venture for both teams. The reason for them doing so was compatible schedules: Ensemble Studios was busy with other projectsparticularly Halo Warswhile Big Huge Games' real-time strategy team had few projects at that time. Big Huge Games did most of the work, but Ensemble Studios designers Greg Street and Sandy Petersen joined in the brainstorming, and had control over the final product.[102] Both studios had roles in testing the game before its release.[103]\\r\\nThe Age of Empires series has been a commercial success. As of 2008, five of its games have each sold more than one million copies. According to Gamasutra, Age of Empires had sold more than three million copies, and The Rise of Rome sold one million copies as of 2000.[11] Around the same time, Microsoft announced that they shipped over two million copies of The Age of Kings.[21] In 2003, Microsoft announced the sales of one million copies for Age of Mythology.[59] By 2004prior to the release of Age of Empires IIIthe Age of Empires franchise had sold over 15 million copies.[116] On May 18, 2007, Ensemble Studios announced that two million copies of Age of Empires III had been sold.[38] Games in the series have consistently scored highly on video game review aggregator websites GameRankings and Metacritic, which collect data from numerous review websites. As noted in the adjacent table, the highest rating game is Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, receiving a 92% score from both sites.[19][20]\\r\\nCritics have credited Age of Empires for influencing real-time strategy (RTS) games such as Rise of Nations, Empire Earth, and Cossacks.[117][118] Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds was also influenced by the series: it utilized the Genie game engine, as Age of Empires and Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings had, and was considered by critics to be a very close replica to the games; IGN began their review with the statement \\"I love Age of Star Wars, I mean Star Empires. Whatever it's called, I dig it.\\"[119] and GameSpot wrote that \\"fundamentals of the Age of Empires II engine are so intact in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds that veterans of that game can jump right in.\\"[120] In October 2005, Shelley commented on the impact of the series. In a GameSpy interview, he explained that parents would \\"tell Ensemble Studios that their kid is reading books about ancient Greece because they enjoy playing with the triremes so much, or that they want to check out books about medieval history because [the] game taught them what a trebuchet was.\\"[121]\\r\\nShelley has said that the key to the success of the games was its innovation, rather than imitation of its peers. He also claimed the unique elements in the games \\"helped establish the reputation of Ensemble Studios as masters of the real-time strategy genre.\\"[122] Mark Bozon of IGN wrote in his review of The Age of Kings, \\"The Age of Empires series has been one of the most innovative real-time strategy games for PC in the last decade or so.\\"[123] Gamenikki called Ensemble Studios \\"the developer that started it all\\" when they talked about how much Age of Empires III had done to advance the real-time strategy genre.[124] Shelley has acknowledged the success and innovation of Age of Empires helped to ensure Ensemble survive its early periods since startup.[125] In 2005, Shelley complained of critics holding an \\"innovation bias\\" against the series; citing the 60% score from Computer Gaming World, he said that despite Age of Empires III being \\"perhaps the best selling PC game in the world,\\" reviewers expected \\"something really new,\\" and rated it harshly.[126]\\r\\nBungie Studios chose Ensemble Studios to develop Halo Wars, an RTS game based on their Halo series. They said that one of the reasons they chose to work with Ensemble was because of the \\"awesometastic\\" Age of Empires series.[127] They also noted that Ensemble was the perfect choice \\"to realize the original vision of Halo,\\" which started life as an RTS.[127]","input":"How many age of empires games are there?"},{"output":"Baltimore-Washington International Airport","context":"Washington Dulles International Airport (/?d?l?s/ DUL-iss) (IATA: IAD,?ICAO: KIAD,?FAA LID: IAD) is an international airport in Loudoun and Fairfax counties in Virginia, United States, 26 miles (42?km) west of downtown Washington, D.C.[3] The airport serves the BaltimoreÿWashington metropolitan area, centered on the District of Columbia. The airport is named after John Foster Dulles, the 52nd Secretary of State who served under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Dulles main terminal is a well-known landmark designed by Eero Saarinen. Operated by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, Dulles Airport occupies 13,000 acres (52.6?km2)[4] straddling the Loudoun-Fairfax line.[1] Most of the airport is in the unincorporated community of Dulles, in Loudoun County, with a small portion in the unincorporated community of Chantilly in Fairfax County.\\r\\nDulles is one of the three major airports in the larger BaltimoreÿWashington metropolitan area with more than 21 million passengers a year.[5][6] Dulles has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the Mid-Atlantic outside of the New York metropolitan area, including approximately 90% of the international passenger traffic in the Baltimore-Washington region.[7] On a typical day, more than 60,000 passengers pass through Washington Dulles to and from more than 125 destinations around the world.[5][8] However, Dulles Airport now ranks behind both Baltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI) and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) in total annual passenger boardings.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to World War II, Hoover Field was the main commercial airport serving Washington. It was replaced by Washington National Airport in 1941. After the war, in 1948, the Civil Aeronautics Administration began to consider sites for a second major airport to serve the nation's capital.[10] Congress passed the Washington Airport Act in 1950 to provide funding for a new airport in the region.[11] The initial CAA proposal in 1951 called for the airport to be built in Fairfax County near what is now Burke Lake Park, but protests from residents, as well as the rapid expansion of Washington's suburbs during the time, led to reconsideration of this plan.[12] One competing plan called for the airport to be built in the Pender area of Fairfax County, while another called for the conversion of Andrews Air Force Base in Prince George's County, Maryland.[10]\\r\\nThe current site was selected by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1958;[12] the Dulles name was chosen by Eisenhower's aviation advisor Pete Quesada, who later served as the first head of the Federal Aviation Administration. As a result of the site selection, the unincorporated, largely African-American community of Willard, which once stood in the airport's current footprint, was demolished, and 87 property owners had their holdings condemned.[10]\\r\\nThe civil engineering firm Ammann and Whitney was named lead contractor. The airport was dedicated by President John F. Kennedy on November 17, 1962. As originally opened, the airport had three runways (current day runways 1C/19C, 1R/19L, and 12/30). Its original name, Dulles International Airport, was changed in 1984 to Washington Dulles International Airport.[13] The main terminal was designed in 1958 by famed Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, and it is highly regarded for its graceful beauty, suggestive of flight. In the 1990s, the main terminal at Dulles was reconfigured to allow more space between the front of the building and the ticket counters. Additions at both ends of the main terminal more than doubled the structure's length. The original terminal at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in Taoyuan, Taiwan was modeled after the Saarinen terminal at Dulles.\\r\\nThe design included a landscaped man-made lake to collect rainwater, a low-rise hotel, and a row of office buildings along the north side of the main parking lot. The design also included a two-level road in front of the terminal to separate arrival and departure traffic and a federally owned limited access highway connecting the terminal to the Capital Beltway (I-495) about 17 miles (27?km) to the east. (Eventually, the highway system grew to include a parallel toll road to handle commuter traffic and an extension to connect to I-66). The access road had a wide median strip to allow the construction of a passenger rail line, which will be in the form of an extension of the Washington Metro's Silver Line and is expected to be completed in 2020.\\r\\nBy the 1980s the original design, which had mobile lounges meet each plane, was no longer well-suited to Dulles' role as a hub airport. Instead, midfield concourses were added to allow passengers to walk between connecting flights without visiting the main terminal. Mobile lounges were still used for international flights and to transport passengers between the midfield concourses and the main terminal. An underground tunnel (consisting of a passenger walkway and moving sidewalks) which links the main terminal and Concourse B was opened in 2004.[24] The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) began a renovation program for the airport including a new security mezzanine with more room for lines.[25]\\r\\nA new train system, dubbed AeroTrain and developed by Mitsubishi, began in 2010 to transport passengers between the concourses and the main terminal.[26] The system, which uses rubber tires and travels along a fixed underground guideway,[26] is similar to the people mover systems at Singapore Changi Airport,[26] HartsfieldÿJackson Atlanta International Airport, and Denver International Airport. The train is intended to replace the mobile lounges, which many passengers found crowded and inconvenient. The initial phase includes the main terminal station, a permanent Concourse A station, a permanent Concourse B station, a permanent midfield concourse station (with access to the current temporary C concourse via a tunnel with moving walkways), and a maintenance facility.[26] Mobile lounges continue to service the D Concourse from both the main terminal and Concourse A. Even after AeroTrain is built out and the replacement Concourses C and D are built, the mobile lounges and plane mates will still continue to be used, to transport international arriving passengers to the International Arrivals Building, as well as transport passengers to aircraft parked on hardstands without direct access to jet bridges. Dulles has stated that the wait time for a train does not exceed four minutes, compared to the average 15-minute wait and travel time for mobile lounges.\\r\\nUnder the development plan, future phases would see the addition of several new midfield concourses and a new south terminal.[27] A fourth runway (parallel to the existing runways 1 and 19 L&R) opened in 2008,[28] and development plans include a fifth runway to parallel the existing runway 12ÿ30.[29] If this runway is built, the current runway will be redesignated as 12L-30R while the new runway will be designated 12R-30L. An expansion of the B concourse, used by many low cost airlines as well as international arrivals, has been completed, and the building housing Concourses C and D will eventually be knocked down to make room for a more ergonomic building. Because Concourses C and D are temporary concourses, the only way to get to those concourses is via moving walkway from the Concourse C station which is built in the location of the future gates and Concourse D by mobile lounge from the main terminal.[30]\\r\\nThe airport's terminal complex consists of a main terminal and two midfield terminal buildings: Concourses A/B and C/D. The entire terminal complex has 123 gates and 16 hardstand locations[31] from which passengers can board or disembark using the airport's plane mate vehicles.[4]\\r\\nConceived in early planning sessions in 1959, Dulles is one of the few remaining airports to use the mobile lounge (also known as \\"plane mates\\" or \\"people movers\\") for boarding and disembarkation from aircraft, and to transfer passengers between the midfield concourses and to and from the main terminal building. They have all been given names based on the postal abbreviations of 50 states, e.g., VA, MD, AK.[32]\\r\\nThe Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority has begun to gradually phase out the mobile lounge system for inter-terminal passenger movements in favor of the AeroTrain, an underground people mover which currently operates to Concourses A, B and C, as well as underground pedestrian walkway tunnels (now in service to concourse A/B). The mobile lounges are still used to transport passengers directly from the main terminal to Concourse D. Plane mates also remain in use to disembark international passengers and carry them to the International Arrivals Building, as well as to convey passengers to and from aircraft on hard stand (i.e., those parked remotely on the apron without access to jet bridges).[33][34]\\r\\nDulles's iconic main terminal houses ticketing, baggage claim, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, an international arrivals building for passenger processing, the Z gates, information facilities and other support facilities. The terminal was recognized by the American Institute of Architects in 1966 for its design concept; its roof is a suspended catenary providing a wide enclosed area unimpeded by any columns.\\r\\nThe main terminal was extended in 1996 to 1,240 feet (380?m)Saarinen's original design lengthwhich was slightly more than double its originally constructed length of 600 feet (180?m).[31] In addition, an extension for international arrivals was added to the west of the main terminal in 1991. On September 22, 2009, an expansion of the international arrivals building opened which includes a 41,400 square feet (3,850?m2) arrival hall for customs and immigration processing. The new facility has the capacity to process 2,400 arriving passengers per hour.[35]\\r\\nAlso in September 2009, a 121,700 square feet (11,310?m2) central security checkpoint was added on a new security mezzanine level of the main terminal. This checkpoint replaced previous checkpoints which were located behind the ticketing areas.[36] A separate security checkpoint is available on the baggage claim level. Both security checkpoints connect to the AeroTrain, which links the main terminal with the A, B, and C concourses.\\r\\nThere are two sets of gates in the main terminal: the first is the \\"H\\" Gates, which are waiting areas for airlines which lack permanent physical jetbridges and therefore use plane mates to reach planes parked at 16 hard-stand locations. The other is a set of four gates with jetbridges that are designated as Concourse Z, which provides service for Air Canada Express and Frontier Airlines.\\r\\nAll airlines aside from Air Canada Express and Frontier Airlines operate out of two linear satellite terminals. One contains Concourses A and B, and the second contains Concourses C and D.\\r\\nAll non-United flights & United Express operate out of these two concourses. Concourse A (which has 47 gates) composes the eastern part of the closer midfield terminal building. It consists of a permanent ground level set of gates designed for small planes and regional jets used by United Express, and several former Concourse B gates.[37] The concourse is primarily used for international flights. Air France operates an airline lounge opposite gate A22, Etihad Airways operates a First and Business Class lounge across from gate A15, and Virgin Atlantic has a Clubhouse lounge across from gate A32. Concourse A's AeroTrain station is located halfway along the horizontal length of the building, between gates A6 and A14.\\r\\nConcourse B (which has 28 gates) composes the western half of the building. It is the first of the permanent elevated midfield concourses. Originally constructed in 1998 and designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, the B concourse contained 20 gates. In 2003, 4 additional gates were added to concourse B, followed by a 15-gate expansion in 2008.[38] In addition to the AeroTrain station located between gates B51 and B62, Concourse B also has an underground walkway to connect it to the main terminal. Concourse B is used by some international carriers, and is also utilized by all non-United domestic and Canada flights. The facility also includes a British Airways Galleries lounge, a Lufthansa lounge divided into Senator and Business class sections located between gates B49 and B51, and a Turkish Airlines Lounge near gate B43.[39]\\r\\nConcourses C/D are solely used for United Airlines flights. All mainline United flights and most United Express regional jet operations operate out of these concourses (some United Express flights use Concourse A).\\r\\nThese concourses were constructed in 1983 and designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum. The two concourses have 22 gates each, numbered C1-C28 and D1-D32, with odd-numbered gates on the north side of the building and even numbered gates on the south side. Concourse C composes the eastern half of the terminal and Concourse D composes the gates on the west half of the terminal.[40][41] The C/D concourses were given a face lift in 2006 which included light fixture upgrades, new paint finishes, new ceiling grids and tiles, heating and air conditioning replacement, and complete restroom renovations.[41]\\r\\nConcourse C also has a dedicated Federal Inspection Station located at ground level. International United flights not originating at an airport with US customs preclearance can directly deplane passengers via jetbridge at Concourse C (as opposed to using plane mates to offload passengers). Once deplaned, arriving passengers are separated. Passengers terminating at Dulles take a mobile lounge that transports them to the International Arrivals Building, while connecting passengers continuing on another United flight go through U.S. Customs and Immigration at the FIS station on the ground level. Since this immigration facility is only for connecting passengers on United and other Star Alliance carriers, it has shorter lines and passengers don't have to reclear security at the massive security checkpoints in the main terminal.\\r\\nThe facility houses three United Clubs: one adjacent to Gate C7, one adjacent to gate C17, and one adjacent to gate D8. A United International First Lounge is near gate C2. Concourse C is directly linked to the main terminal via the AeroTrain, while mobile lounges can be used to travel from Concourse D to the main terminal.\\r\\nA new and permanent C/D concourse (also called \\"Tier 2\\") is planned as part of the D2 Dulles Development Project. The new building is to include a three-level structure with 44 airline gates and similar amenities to Concourse B.[41] The concourse plan includes a dedicated mezzanine corridor with moving sidewalks to serve international passengers. The design and construction of the new C/D concourse has not been scheduled.[41] When built, it is planned that both terminals will be connected to the main terminal and other concourses via the AeroTrain. To that extent, the AeroTrain station at Concourse C was built at the location where the future Concourse C/D structure is proposed to be built, and is connected to the existing Concourse C via an underground walkway.\\r\\nSince many major domestic and international airlines have a large presence at Washington Dulles, there are several airline lounges within the airport:\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\nAlong with Newark Liberty International Airport, Dulles is one of United Air Lines' two transatlantic gateways with many nonstop flights to Europe, Asia, South America and the Middle East. As of June 2015 United handled 61.1% of scheduled air carrier passengers at the airport in.[50] American Airlines has a 4.8% market share.[50] Delta Air Lines handles 4.1% of scheduled air carrier passengers.[50] In addition, 25 foreign carriers have service in and out of Washington Dulles.[51]\\r\\nOn a typical day, Dulles averages 1,000 to 1,200 flight operations.[52] Dulles International served 21.6 million passengers in 2014, a 1.7% decrease over 2013. However, international passenger traffic has increased by 1.6% to nearly 7.1 million during the same time.[53] Additional international service is commencing service at Washington Dulles. With 45 weekly flights, Dulles is now the third largest United States gateway to the Middle East. Even before the United States economic recession started, international passengers have continued to grow, which prompted the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority to expand the International Arrivals Building to handle 2,400 passengers per hour.\\r\\nDulles is accessible via the Dulles Access Road/Dulles Greenway (State Route 267) and State Route 28. The Dulles Airport Access Highway (DAAH) is a toll-free, limited access, highway owned by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) to facilitate car access to Dulles from the Washington Capital Beltway and Interstate 66.[59] After it opened, non-airport traffic between Washington and Reston became so heavy that a parallel set of toll lanes were added on the same right-of-way to accommodate non-airport traffic (Dulles Toll Road). However, the airport-only lanes are both less congested as well as toll-free. As of November 1, 2008, MWAA assumed responsibility from the Virginia Department of Transportation both for operating the Dulles Toll Road and for the construction of a rapid transit rail line down its median. Route 28, which runs northÿsouth along the eastern edge of the airport, has been upgraded to a limited access highway, with the interchanges financed through a property tax surcharge on nearby business properties. The Dulles Toll Road has been extended to the west to Leesburg as the Dulles Greenway.\\r\\nFairfax Connector routes 981 and 983 serve Dulles, connecting to the HerndonÿMonroe park & ride lot in Herndon, the Reston Town Center transit in Reston, the Wiehle ÿ Reston East Metro station, and the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center Air and Space Museum.\\r\\nAs of 2014[update] the only Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority service to Dulles is the \\"Express\\" 5A Metrobus route. The 5A express bus makes two stops on its way from the airport to downtown Washington. Stops include the HerndonÿMonroe park & ride lot in Herndon and the Rosslyn Metro station in Arlington. It terminates at the L'Enfant Plaza Metro station in Southwest DC. Both Metro stations can be accessed by the Orange, Blue, and Silver lines, while L'Enfant Plaza is also served by the Yellow and Green lines.\\r\\nAn alternative way of reaching Dulles is the Washington Flyer's Silver Line Express bus service that operates roughly every 15ÿ20 minutes between the airport and the Wiehle ÿ Reston East Metro station.[60] Washington Flyer service will be permanently discontinued when Phase II of the Silver Line opens in 2020.[61]\\r\\nPassengers connecting to the Shenandoah Valley can use the Shenandoah Valley Commuter Bus, which connects to the Vienna and Rosslyn Metro stations. Washington Flyer was given a monopoly to operate cabs from Dulles Airport, as no other taxis can take passengers from the airport.[62] SuperShuttle ride sharing vans are also available. A special location exists for Uber and Lyft vehicles to take passengers, but the drivers need a special permit and there is an additional cost of $4 per trip.[63]\\r\\nConstruction is now underway to connect the airport to Washington via the Silver Line of the Washington Metro.[64] While initial plans called for completion of the station in 2016, officials now expect the construction to be completed in 2020.[65][66]\\r\\n Media related to Washington Dulles International Airport at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What is the main airport in washington dc?"},{"output":"mostly eight","context":"Telephone numbers in Hong Kong are mostly eight-digit.

While much of the neighborhood is residential, Downtown Flushing, centered on the northern end of Main Street in Queens, is a large commercial and retail area and is the fourth largest central business district in New York City.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlushing's diversity is reflected by the numerous ethnic groups that reside there, including people of Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, European, and African American ancestry. It is part of New York's Sixth Congressional District, which is located entirely within Queens County. Flushing is served by five railroad stations on the Long Island Rail Road Port Washington Branch, as well as the New York City Subway's IRT Flushing Line (7 and <7>? trains), which has its terminus at Main Street. The intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue is the third busiest intersection in New York City, behind Times and Herald Squares.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood of Flushing is part of Queens Community Board 7[6] and the broader district of Flushing in Queens County. The Flushing \\"neighborhood\\" is bounded by Flushing MeadowsÿCorona Park to the west, Kissena Boulevard to the east, the Long Island Expressway to the south, and Willets Point Boulevard to the north.\\r\\n\\r\\nZIP codes beginning with 113 are administered from a sectional center at Flushing Post Office. The 113-prefixed area extends northwest from Broadway-Flushing, Elmhurst and Jackson Heights, south into Ridgewood, Forest Hills, and Fresh Meadows, and  Murray Hill, Bayside, and Little Neck to the east.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlushing was originally inhabited by the Matinecoc Indians prior to colonialization and English settlement.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 10, 1645, Flushing was established on the eastern bank of Flushing Creek under charter of the Dutch West India Company and was part of the New Netherland colony. The settlement was named after the city of Vlissingen, in the southwestern Netherlands, the main port of the company. However, by 1657, the residents called the place \\"Vlishing.\\"  Eventually, \\"Flushing\\", the British name for Vlissingen, was used. Despite being a Dutch colony, many of the early inhabitants were British. The original name is supposedly derived from the Dutch word \\"fles\\" which means \\"bottle.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike all other towns in the region, the charter of Flushing allowed residents freedom of religion as practiced in Holland \\"without the disturbance of any magistrate or ecclesiastical minister.\\" However, New Amsterdam Director-General Peter Stuyvesant issued an edict prohibiting the harboring of Quakers. On December 27, 1657, the inhabitants of Flushing approved a protest known as The Flushing Remonstrance.  This petition contained religious arguments even mentioning freedom for \\"Jews, Turks, and Egyptians,\\" but ended with a forceful declaration that any infringement of the town charter would not be tolerated. Subsequently, a farmer named John Bowne held Quaker meetings in his home and was arrested for this and deported to Holland. Eventually he persuaded the Dutch West India Company to allow Quakers and others to worship freely.[8] As such, Flushing is claimed to be a birthplace of religious freedom in the New World.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nLandmarks remaining from the Dutch period in Flushing include the John Bowne House on Bowne Street and the Old Quaker Meeting House on Northern Boulevard.  The Remonstrance was signed at a house on the site of the former State Armory, now a police facility, on the south side Northern Boulevard between Linden Place and Union Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1664, the English took control of New Amsterdam, ending Dutch control of the colony, and renamed it the Province of New York. When Queens County was established in 1683, the \\"Town of Flushing\\" was one of the original five towns which the county comprised.[10] Many historical references to Flushing are to this town, bounded from Newtown on the west by Flushing Creek (now Flushing River), from Jamaica on the south by the watershed, and from Hempstead on the east by what later became the Nassau County line. The town was dissolved in 1898 when Queens became a borough of New York City, and the term \\"Flushing\\" today usually refers to a much smaller area, for example the former Village of Flushing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlushing was a seat of power as the Province of New York up to the American Revolution was led by Governor Cadwallader Colden, based at his Spring Hill estate.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlushing was the site of the first commercial tree nurseries in North America, the most prominent being the Prince, Bloodgood, and Parsons nurseries. Much of the northern section of Kissena Park, former site of the Parsons nursery, still contains a wide variety of exotic trees. The naming of streets intersecting Kissena Boulevard on its way toward Kissena Park celebrates this fact (Ash Avenue, Beech, Cherry ...Poplar, Quince, Rose). Flushing also supplied trees to the Greensward project, now known as Central Park in Manhattan.  Well into the 20th century, Flushing contained many horticultural establishments and greenhouses.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the American Revolution, Flushing, along with most settlements in present-day Queens County, favored the British and quartered British troops, though one battalion of Scottish Highlanders is known to have been stationed at Flushing during the war. Following the Battle of Long Island, Nathan Hale, an officer in the Continental Army, was apprehended near Flushing Bay while on what was probably an intelligence gathering mission and was later hanged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1785 Kingsland Homestead, originally the residence of a wealthy Quaker merchant, now serves as the home of the Queens Historical Society.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 19th century, as New York City continued to grow in population and economic vitality, so did Flushing. Its proximity to Manhattan was critical in its transformation into a fashionable residential area. On April 15, 1837, the Village of Flushing was incorporated within the Town of Flushing.[14] The official seal was merely the words, \\"Village of Flushing,\\" surrounded by nondescript flowers. No other emblem or flag is known to have been used. By the mid-1860s, Queens County had 30,429 residents. Flushing's growth continued with two new villages incorporating: College Point in 1867, and Whitestone in 1868. The first free public high school in what is now New York City was established in Flushing in 1875.  Flushing, then a small village, established a library in 1858.  This is the oldest in Queens County and only slightly younger than the library of the City of Brooklyn (1852). In 1898, although opposed to the proposal, the Town of Flushing (along with two other towns of Queens County) was consolidated into the City of New York to form the new Borough of Queens. All towns, villages, and cities within the new borough were dissolved. Local farmland continued to be subdivided and developed transforming Flushing into a densely populated neighborhood of New York City.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe continued construction of bridges over the Flushing River and the development of other roads increased the volume of vehicular traffic into Flushing. In 1909, the construction of the Queensboro Bridge (also known as the 59th Street Bridge) over the East River connected Queens County to midtown Manhattan.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe introduction of rail road service to Manhattan in 1910 by the Long Island Rail Road Port Washington Branch and in 1928 by the New York City Subway's IRT Flushing Line (7 and <7>? trains) hastened the continued transformation of Flushing to a commuter suburb and commercial center. Due to increased traffic, a main roadway through Flushing named Broadway was widened and renamed Northern Boulevard.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlushing was a forerunner of Hollywood, when the young American film industry was still based on the U.S. East Coast and Chicago. Decades later, the RKO Keith's movie palace would host vaudeville acts and appearances by the likes of Mickey Rooney, the Marx Brothers and Bob Hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 21st century, Flushing has cemented its status as an international melting pot, predominantly attracting immigrants from Asia, particularly from throughout the various provinces of China, but including newcomers from all over the world. Flushing Chinatown is centered around Main Street and the area to its west, most prominently along Roosevelt Avenue, which have become the primary nexus of Flushing Chinatown. However, Chinatown continues to expand southeastward along Kissena Boulevard and northward beyond Northern Boulevard. The Flushing Chinatown houses over 30,000 individuals born in China alone, the largest Chinatown by this metric outside Asia and one of the largest and fastest-growing Chinatowns in the world.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1970s, a Chinese community established a foothold in the neighborhood of Flushing, whose demographic constituency had been predominantly non-Hispanic white, interspersed with a small Japanese  community. This wave of immigrants from Taiwan were the first to arrive and developed Flushing's Chinatown. It was known as Little Taipei or Little Taiwan.  Along with immigrants from Taiwan at this time, a large South Korean population also called Flushing home.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the 1970s, Cantonese immigrants had vastly dominated Chinese immigration to New York City; however during the 1970s, the Taiwanese immigrants were the first wave of Chinese immigrants who spoke Mandarin (Taiwanese also spoken) rather than Cantonese to arrive in New York City. Many Taiwanese immigrants were additionally Hokkien and had relatives or connections to Fujian province in China, which led to large influxes of Fuzhounese Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the years, many new non-Cantonese ethnic Chinese immigrants from different regions and provinces of China started to arrive in New York City and settled in Flushing through word of mouth. This led to the creation of a more Mandarin-speaking Chinatown or Mandarin Town that gradually replaced Little Taipei. This wave of immigrants spoke Mandarin and various regional/provincial dialects. The early 90s and 2000s brought a wave of Fuzhounese Americans and Wenzhounese immigrants. Like the Taiwanese, they faced cultural and communication problems in Manhattan's dominant Cantonese-speaking Chinatown and settled in Flushing as well as Elmhurst, Queens, which also has a significant Mandarin-speaking population. Flushing's Chinese population became very diverse over the next few decades as people from different provinces started to arrive, infusing their varied languages and cultures into this new \\"Chinatown.\\" [17][18][19][20] Due to the increased opening of Mainland China, there has been a growing Northern Chinese population in Flushing. These diverse Chinese immigrant populations have brought with them their own regional food cuisines which have led to Flushing being considered a \\"Food Mecca\\" for Chinese regional cuisine outside of Asia.[21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Flushing was 72,008, an increase of 2,646 (3.8%) from the 69,362 counted in 2000. Covering an area of 853.06 acres (345.22?ha), the neighborhood had a population density of 84.4 inhabitants per acre (54,000/sq?mi; 20,900/km2).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe racial makeup of the neighborhood was 9.5% (6,831) White, 4.2% (3,016) African American, 0.1% (74) Native American, 69.2% (49,830) Asian, 0.1% (59) Pacific Islander, 0.2% (172) from other races, and 1.8% (1,303) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 14.9% (10,723) of the population.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlushing Chinatown (X?A), or Mandarin Town (?}Z)[24] is one of the largest and fastest growing ethnic Chinese enclaves outside Asia, as well as within New York City itself. In Mandarin, Flushing is known as \\"Falasheng\\" (Chinese: X; pinyin: FҊlshng).\\r\\n\\r\\nMain Street and the area to its west, particularly along Roosevelt Avenue, have become the primary nexus of Flushing's Chinatown. However, Chinatown continues to expand southeastward along Kissena Boulevard and northward beyond Northern Boulevard. In the 1970s, a Chinese community established a foothold in the neighborhood of Flushing, whose demographic constituency had been predominantly non-Hispanic white. Taiwanese began the surge of immigration, followed by other groups of Chinese. By 1990, Asians constituted 41% of the population of the core area of Flushing, with Chinese in turn representing 41% of the Asian population.[17] However, ethnic Chinese are constituting an increasingly dominant proportion of the Asian population as well as of the overall population in Flushing and its Chinatown. A 1986 estimate by the Flushing Chinese Business Association approximated 60,000 Chinese in Flushing alone.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue, the business center for Flushing, on the westernmost edge of the neighborhood, has a large concentration of Chinese and Korean businesses, including Asian restaurants. Chinese-owned businesses in particular dominate the area along Main Street and the blocks west of it. Many of the signs and advertisements of the stores in the area are in Chinese. Ethnic Chinese constitute an increasingly dominant proportion of the Asian population and as well as of the overall population in Flushing. Consequently, Flushing's Chinatown has grown rapidly enough to become the largest Chinatown outside Asia and has surpassed the Manhattan Chinatown in size.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1986 estimate by the Flushing Chinese Business Association approximated 60,000 Chinese in Flushing alone.[26] By 1990, Asians constituted 41% of the population of the core area of Flushing, with Chinese in turn representing 41% of the Asian population.[17] However, ethnic Chinese are constituting an increasingly dominant proportion of the Asian population as well as of the overall population in Flushing and its Chinatown. High rates of both legal[27][28] and illegal[29] immigration from Mainland China continue to spur the ongoing rise of the ethnic Chinese population in Flushing, as in all of New York City's Chinatowns.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a Daily News article, Flushing's Chinatown ranks as New York City's second largest Chinese community with 33,526 Chinese, up from 17,363, a 93% increase. The Brooklyn Chinatown (ƱZHݛ?A) now ranks #1 as the largest Chinatown of NYC with 34,218 Chinese residents, up from 19,963 in 2000, a 71% increase. As for Manhattan's Chinatown, its Chinese population declined by 17%, from 34,554 to 28,681 since 2000 to rank #3.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlushing now rivals Manhattan's Chinatown as a center of Chinese culture[32] and has been called the \\"Chinese Manhattan\\".[33] The Lunar New Year Parade has become a growing annual celebration of Chinese New Year. More and larger Chinese supermarkets are locating and selling a diverse and uniquely vast array of Chinese food and ingredient selections in Flushing, the largest of which include Hong Kong Supermarket and New York Supermarket, which also happen to be rapidly growing Chinese American chain supermarkets.[34][35][36] The segment of Main Street between Roosevelt Avenue and Kissena Boulevard represents the cultural heart of Flushing Chinatown. Flushing's rise as an epicenter of Chinese culture outside Asia has been attributed to the remarkable diversity of regional Chinese demographics represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Journal, one of the largest Chinese-language newspapers outside China, is headquartered in adjacent Whitestone (f), Queens, with offices in Flushing as well.[31] Numerous other Chinese- and English-language publications are available in Flushing. SinoVision, founded in 1990, one of the largest and most influential Chinese language television networks in North America has offices in Flushing while headquartered in Midtown Manhattan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe popular styles of Chinese cuisine are ubiquitously accessible in Flushing,[37] including Hakka, Taiwanese, Shanghainese, Hunanese, Szechuan, Cantonese, Fujianese, Xinjiang, Zhejiang, and Korean Chinese cuisine. Even the relatively obscure Dongbei style of cuisine indigenous to Northeast China is now available in Flushing,[38] as well as Mongolian cuisine and Uyghur cuisine.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nMandarin Chinese[40] (including Northeastern Mandarin), Fuzhou dialect, Min Nan (Hokkien), Wu Chinese (Wenzhounese, Shanghainese, Suzhou dialect, Hangzhou dialect), Cantonese, and English are all prevalently spoken in Flushing Chinatown, while the Mongolian language is now emerging. Given its rapidly growing status, the Flushing Chinatown has surpassed in size and population the original New York City Chinatown in the borough of Manhattan[16] and this substantial growth has resulted in a commensurate rise in this Chinatown's cultural status. The New York Times says that Flushing's Chinatown now rivals Manhattan's Chinatown for being the center of Chinese-speaking New Yorkers' politics and trade.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn accompaniment with its rapid growth, Flushing in particular has witnessed the proliferation of highly competitive businesses touted as educational centers as well as non-profit organizations declaring the intent to educate the community. Some entities offer education in Mandarin,[42] the lingua franca of Mainland China; others profess to provide students with intensive training in computer and technological proficiency; while still others entice high school students with rigorous preparatory classes for college entrance examinations in mathematics, science, and English literacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nA diverse array of social services geared toward assisting recent as well as established Chinese immigrants is readily available in Flushing.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Elmhurst Chinatown on Broadway in nearby Elmhurst, another neighborhood in the borough of Queens, also has a large and rapidly growing Chinese community and is developing as a satellite of the Flushing Chinatown. Previously a small area with Chinese shops on Broadway between 81st Street and Cornish Avenue, this newly evolved second Chinatown in Queens has now expanded to 45th Avenue and Whitney Avenue.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nA third and fledgling Chinatown is now emerging in Queens, geographically between Flushing and Elmhurst, in the neighborhood of Corona.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a Koreatown which originated in Flushing, but has since spread eastward to Murray Hill, Bayside, Douglaston, and Little Neck in Queens, and also into Nassau County.[46][47][48][49][50] As of the 2010 United States Census, the Korean population of Queens was 64,107.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, a continuous stream of Korean immigrants emerged into Flushing, many of whom began as workers in the medical field or Korean international students who had moved to New York City to find or initiate professional or entrepreneurial positions.[47] They established a foothold on Union Street in Flushing between 35th and 41st Avenues,[47] featuring restaurants and karaoke (noraebang) bars, grocery markets, education centers and bookstores, banking institutions, offices, consumer electronics vendors, apparel boutiques, and other commercial enterprises.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the community grew in wealth and population and rose in socioeconomic status, Koreans expanded their presence eastward along Northern Boulevard, buying homes[52] in more affluent and less crowded Queens neighborhoods and more recently into adjacent suburban Nassau County, bringing their businesses with them, and thereby expanding the Koreatown itself.[46] This expansion has led to the creation of an American Meokjagolmok, or Korean Restaurant Street, around the Long Island Rail Road station in Murray Hill, Queens, exuding the ambience of Seoul itself.[46] The eastward pressure to expand was also created by the inability to move westward, inhibited by the formidable presence of the enormous Flushing Chinatown (X?A) centered on Main Street.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nPer the 2010 United States Census, the Korean population of Queens was 64,107,[51] representing the largest municipality in the United States with a density of at least 500 Korean Americans per square mile; while the Korean population of Nassau County had increased by nearly two-thirds to approximately 14,000 over one decade since the 2000 Census.[53] Along with the two Koreatowns of Bergen County, New Jersey (in Palisades Park and Fort Lee) and the Manhattan Koreatown in New York City, the Long Island Koreatown functions as a satellite node for an overall Korean American population of 218,764 individuals in the New York City Metropolitan Area,[54] the second largest population of ethnic Koreans outside Korea. Korean Air and Asiana Airlines provide non-stop flights from Seoul to JFK Airport[55][56] in Queens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Korea Times, a news organization based in Seoul, carries a significant presence in the Long Island Koreatown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Long Island Koreatown features numerous restaurants that serve both traditional and/or regional Korean cuisine. As noted above, the development of this Koreatown has led to the creation of an American Meokjagolmok, or Korean Restaurant Street, around the Long Island Rail Road station in Murray Hill, exuding the ambiance of Seoul itself.[46] Korean Chinese cuisine is now also available in Koreatown.\\r\\n\\r\\nKorean and English are both spoken prevalently. Retail signs employing the Hangul (??) alphabet are ubiquitous.\\r\\n\\r\\nA significant array of social services toward assisting recent and established Korean immigrants is available in Koreatown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also a significant population of Korean-Chinese or Chinese-Koreans in Flushing that bridge the Chinese and Korean communities. They can speak Mandarin, Korean, and English.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood of East Flushing, technically within Greater Flushing, also houses a substantial Chinese community along with most of Downtown Flushing. However, East Flushing also substantially includes Irish, Greek, Russian, and Italian communities, as well as communities of Indians, Sri Lankans, Malaysians, and Hispanics, mostly Colombians and Salvadorans. This neighborhood tends to be more diverse visibly than Downtown Flushing because of the more even distribution of the ethnicities of East Flushing residents resulting in more businesses catering to each community rather than the dominance of Chinese and to a lesser extent Korean businesses in Downtown Flushing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe northeastern section of Flushing near Bayside continues to maintain large Italian and Greek presences that are reflected in its many Italian and Greek bakeries, grocery stores and restaurants. The northwest is a mix of Jews, Greeks, and Italians. Most of central Flushing is an ethnic mix of Whites, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn area south of Franklin Avenue houses a concentration of Indian, Pakistani, Afghan, and Bangladeshi markets. This concentration of South Asian businesses south of Franklin Avenue has existed since the late 1970s, one of the oldest Little Indias in North America. The Sri Maha Vallabha Ganapati Devasthanam (Sanskrit: ???? ???????? ????? ??????????, Tamil: ???? ??? ????? ????? ??????????) at 45-57 Bowne Street in Flushing was the very first of the traditional Hindu temples in the US.[58][59] However, Indians are migrating eastward into neighborhoods in northeastern Queens and into Nassau County, as with many Chinese and Korean immigrants.\\r\\n\\r\\nBroadway-Flushing, also known as North Flushing, is a residential area with many large homes. Part of this area has been designated a State and Federal historic district due to the elegant, park-like character of the neighborhood. Much of the area has been rezoned by the City of New York to preserve the low density, residential quality of the neighborhood. The neighborhood awaits designation as an Historic District by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Broadway-Flushing is approximately bounded by 29th Avenue to the north, Northern Boulevard and Crocheron Avenue to the south, 155th Street to the west, and 172nd Streets to the east.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinden Hill is part of Flushing and is served by the NYPD's 109th Precinct and Queens Community Board 7. Its borders are defined as 25th Avenue to Willets Point Boulevard. to the north, 154th Street to the east, Northern Boulevard to the south and the Whitestone Expressway to the west.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nLinden Hill was originally a rural estate owned by the Mitchell family. Ernest Mitchell owned an adjacent area known as Breezy Hill and his father owned the area now called Linden Hill.[61] The two areas are sometimes referred to as Mitchell-Linden. A major change in the rural nature of Linden Hill occurred in the early 1950s. Neisloss Brothers with architect Benjamin Braunstein envisioned a cooperative project to be set on Linden Hill and landfill of an adjacent swamp which would provide middle-income housing to veterans of World War II and the Korean War[61] under Section 213 of the Federal Housing Act of 1950.[62] Gerace and Castagna with architects Samuel Paul and Seymour Jarmul subsequently developed the larger Linden Towers several years after this. Paul was additionally the architect of Embassy Arms.  In total, 41 six-story buildings containing 3,146 apartments comprising the Linden Hill, Mitchell Gardens, Linden Towers, and Embassy Arms cooperatives were erected.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce a primarily European-American neighborhood, Linden Hill is now a diverse mix of European-Americans, Asian-Americans and Latino-Americans. The Asian-American population has expanded markedly in the southern part of Linden Hill in the past decade (as it has throughout Flushing) and the Latino-American population has also grown noticeably. Conversely, the European-American population has lessened somewhat, though European-Americans still remain in great numbers north of Bayside Avenue, west of 149th Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe local branch of the Queens Borough Public Library is located on Union Street and is known as the Mitchell Linden Branch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis subsection has a median income of $38,978 and ZIP codes of 11354, 11355, and 11358. Traditionally the home of families of Irish and Italian immigrants, many Korean and Chinese immigrants have moved into Murray Hill in recent years. Murray Hill within Flushing is often confused with the larger Murray Hill neighborhood on the East Side of Manhattan.[63][64]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the area was developed for residential housing in 1889, Murray Hill was the location of several large nurseries owned by the King, Murray, and Parsons families.[65] The Kingsland Homestead has been preserved as the home of the Queens Historical Society.[63] The Voelker Orth Museum, Bird Sanctuary and Victorian Garden is also located in Murray Hill.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nComic strip artist Richard F. Outcault, the creator of The Yellow Kid and Buster Brown, lived on 147th Street in Murray Hill.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nQueensboro Hill in southern Flushing is bordered to the West by College Point Boulevard, to the North by Kissena Park and Kissena Corridor Park, to the South by Reeves Avenue and the Long Island Expressway, and to the East by Kissena Boulevard. Queensboro Hill is a part of ZIP codes 11355 and 11367 and contains a New York Hospital Queens branch. One of the leading churches is the Queensboro Hill Community Church, a multi-racial congregation of the Reformed Church in America. Turtle Playground serves the residents of this section of Flushing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis area is often referred to as South Flushing. This may also refer to Pomonok.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Waldheim neighborhood, an estate subdivision in Flushing constructed primarily between 1875 and 1925, is a small district of upscale \\"in-town\\" suburban architecture that preservationists have tried to save for at least twenty-five years. Waldheim, German for \\"home in the woods\\", known for its large homes of varying architectural styles, laid out in an unusual street pattern, was the home of some of Flushing's wealthiest residents until the 1960s. Notable residents include the Helmann family of condiment fame, the Steinway family of piano notability, as well as A. Douglas Nash, who managed a nearby Tiffany glass plant. The neighborhood was rezoned by the City of New York in 2008, in order to halt the destruction of its original housing stock, which began in the late 1980s, and to help preserve the low density, residential character of the neighborhood. As with the Broadway neighborhood, preservationists have been unable to secure designation as an Historic District by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission to date. Today, Waldheim stretches between Sanford and Franklin Avenues on the north, 45th Avenue on the south, Bowne Street on the west and Parsons Boulevard on the east. The area is immediately southeast of the downtown Flushing commercial core, and adjacent to Kissena Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlushing is among the most religiously diverse communities in America. Today, Flushing abounds with houses of worship, ranging from the Dutch colonial epoch Quaker Meeting House, the historic Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Queens, St. Andrew Avellino Roman Catholic Church, St. George's Episcopal Church, the Free Synagogue of Flushing, the Congregation of Georgian Jews, St. Mel Roman Catholic Church, St. Michael's Catholic Church, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Shrine Church, St. John's Lutheran Church, Queensboro Hill Community Church, Hindu Temple Society of North America, and the Muslim Center of New York.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are \\"over 200 places of worship in a small urban neighborhood about 2.5 square miles (6.3 square kilometers).\\"[69] \\"Flushing has become a model for religious pluralism in America, says R. Scott Hanson, a visiting assistant professor of history at the State University of New York at Binghamton and an affiliate of the Pluralism Project at Harvard University.\\"[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1657, while Flushing was still a Dutch settlement, a document known as the Flushing Remonstrance was created by Edward Hart, the town clerk, where some thirty ordinary citizens protested a ban imposed by Peter Stuyvesant, the director general of New Amsterdam, forbidding the harboring of Quakers. The Remonstrants cited the Flushing Town charter of 1645 which promised liberty of conscience.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlushing has many landmark buildings. Flushing Town Hall[71] on Northern Boulevard is the headquarters of the Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts, an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.[72] The building houses a concert hall and cultural center and is one of the sites designated along the Queens Historical Society's Freedom Mile.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther registered New York City Landmarks include the Bowne House, Kingsland Homestead, Old Quaker Meeting House (1694), Flushing High School, St. George's Church (1854), the Lewis H. Latimer House, the former RKO Keith's movie theater, the United States Post Office on Main Street, and the Unisphere, the iconic 12-story-high stainless steel globe that served as the centerpiece for the 1964 New York World's Fair. The Flushing Armory, on Northern Boulevard, was formerly used by the National Guard. Presently, the Queens North Task Force of the New York City Police Department uses this building.[74]  In 2005, the Fitzgerald-Ginsberg Mansion[75] on Bayside Avenue and in 2007, the Voelker Orth Museum, Bird Sanctuary and Victorian Garden[76] were designated as landmarks.  In addition, the Broadway-Flushing Historic District, Free Synagogue of Flushing, and Main Street Subway Station (Dual System IRT) are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral attractions were originally developed for the World's Fairs in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. There is a stone marker for the two 5,000-year Westinghouse Time Capsules made of special alloys buried in the park, chronicling 20th-century life in the United States, dedicated both in 1938 and 1965. Also in the park are the Queens Museum of Art which features a scale model of the City of New York, the largest architectural model ever built; Queens Theatre in the Park;[78] the New York Hall of Science and the Queens Zoo.  The New York State Pavilion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queens Botanical Garden on Main Street has been in operation continuously since its opening as an exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair. The Botanical Garden carries on Flushing's nearly three centuries-long horticultural tradition, dating back to its once famed tree nurseries and seed farms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the public parks and playgrounds in Flushing are supervised by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. For Queens County, the Department of Parks and Recreation is headquartered at The Overlook in Forest Park located in Kew Gardens.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany shopping malls and entertainment centers have emerged in the heart of Flushing. These multi-use businesses serve as sites for both business and leisure.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic schools in Flushing are supervised by the New York City Department of Education through Administrative District 25. There are numerous public Elementary and Junior High Schools in Flushing and students generally attend a school based on the location of their residence.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic elementary and middle schools include: John Bowne Elementary P.S. 20, P.S. 107,  P.S. 21 Edward Hart Elementary School, Thomas Jefferson Elementary P.S. 22,  Andrew Jackson Elementary P.S. 24, Cadwallader Colden Elementary P.S. 214, P.S. 32, Adrien Block Intermediate I.S. 25, Daniel Carter Beard Junior High School 189, and Edward Bleeker JHS 185.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe six public high schools in Flushing are:\\r\\n\\r\\nI.S. 237, an arts-oriented magnet school also known as Rachel Carson Intermediate School 237, is also located in Flushing, at 46-21 Colden Street. This school consists of grades 6, 7, and 8. The school was named after scientist Rachel Carson, the writer of Silent Spring which inspired people to name the school after her; it opened in 1971. Each year in June for the 8th graders they have a senior trip to the Poconos. In 1999 the school took ownership of a park called Rachel Carson Playground, which is right across from the school. Judith Friedman is the principal of the school, which has over 1200[86] students. Since 2006 the school made room for a new school to use the space up on the 4th floor for the East-West School of International Studies.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe East-West School of International Studies[88] (Public School Q281) was established in 2006 in I.S. 237; the school serves students in grades 6-12 with an emphasis on Asian studies. It opened in September 2006 with 6th through 12th grade classes.[89] Operated by the New York City Department of Education, it is led by principal Ben Sherman, has an average class size of 25 students, and has a student-teacher ratio of 14.9:1 in 2006-07,[90] As it shares space with I.S. 237, the education department is looking at sites for the East-West School to occupy, including a nearby Home Depot.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe East-West School curriculum prepares students to graduate high school with a Regents' diploma and proficiency in Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, or Korean.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nStudent groups and activities include erhu club, anime club, art, STEP team, dance team calligraphy, chess club, dance, film-making, MOUSE Squad (student computer maintenance), mentoring, Model United Nations, music, newspaper, peer tutoring, step club, Korean Traditional Painting, Korean dancing and singing, and student government. Athletic clubs and teams include basketball, yoga, martial arts, soccer, t'ai chi, judo, and table tennis.[93][94][95]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe private high schools include:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 22, 1980,[96] The Japanese School of New York moved from Jamaica Estates, Queens into Fresh Meadows, Queens,[97] near Flushing. In 1991, the school moved to Yonkers in Westchester County, New York, before moving to Greenwich, Connecticut in 1992.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the high number of Chinese & Korean immigrants with (Confucius) educationally orientated outlooks, there is a large number of cram schools (Buxiban & hagwon) located not only in Flushing, but following Northern Blvd. west into Nassau County.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nQueens College, founded in 1937, is a senior college of the City University of New York (CUNY), and is commonly misconstrued to be within Flushing neighborhood limits due to its Flushing mailing address. It is actually located in the nearby neighborhood of Kew Gardens Hills on Kissena Boulevard near the Long Island Expressway. The City University of New York School of Law was founded in 1983 adjacent to the Queens College campus, and was located at 65-21 Main Street in Kew Gardens Hills until 2012.[99] It moved to Long Island City for the Fall 2012 Semester. The Law School operates Main Street Legal Services Corp., a legal services clinic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1858, the first library in Queens County was founded in Flushing.  Today, there are eight branches of the Queens Borough Public Library with Flushing addresses.[101]  The largest of the Flushing branches is located at the intersection of Kissena Boulevard and Main Street[102] in Flushing's central business district and is the busiest branch of the highest circulation system[103] in the country.[102][104] This library has and houses an auditorium for public events. The current building, designed by Polshek Partnership Architects, is the third to be built on the sitethe first was a gift of Andrew Carnegie.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York Hospital Queens (formerly known as Booth Memorial Hospital), a member of the New York-Presbyterian Healthcare System, is a major medical center providing Flushing as well as surrounding communities with comprehensive medical care services.[105] Numerous tertiary medical clinics also serve the residents of Flushing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlushing Hospital Medical Center serves the area as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York City Subway operates the IRT Flushing Line (7 and <7>? trains). The FlushingÿMain Street station, located at the intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue, is currently the eastern terminus of the line.[106] Until the Flushing line made its way to the intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue in 1928, the center of Flushing was considered to be at the intersection of Northern Boulevard and Main Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Long Island Rail Road's Port Washington Branch has five stations in Flushing. The FlushingÿMain Street is located one block away from the IRT station. The other stations in the neighborhood are Mets ÿ Willets Point, Murray Hill, Broadway and Auburndale. The Port Washington Branch provides a direct rail link to Penn Station in Manhattan.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor highways that serve the area include the Van Wyck Expressway, Whitestone Expressway, Grand Central Parkway, and Long Island Expressway. Northern Boulevard extends from the Queensboro Bridge in Long Island City through Flushing into Nassau County.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also many buses run by Metropolitan Transportation Authority affiliate New York City Bus (routes Q12, Q13, Q15, Q15A, Q16, Q17, Q20A, Q20B, Q26, Q27, Q28, Q44 SBS, Q48, Q58) and subsidiary MTA Bus Company (routes Q19, Q25, Q34, Q50, Q65, Q66). The n20G Nassau Inter-County Express bus route terminates in Flushing.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe political stature of Flushing appears to be increasing significantly, with many Chinese from Flushing becoming New York City Council members. Taiwan-born John Liu, former New York City Council member representing District 20, which includes Flushing and other northern Queens neighborhoods, was elected to his current position of New York City Comptroller in November 2009. Concomitantly, Shanghai-born Peter Koo was elected to succeed Liu to assume this council membership seat. Additionally, in 2012 Flushing resident Grace Meng, a State Assembly Member, was elected to Congress as the first Asian-American member of that chamber east of the Mississippi.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 404453N 734859W? / ?40.74806N 73.81639W? / 40.74806; -73.81639","input":"What is the population of flushing new york?"},{"output":"14 December 1972","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n??Luna programme (USSR)\\r\\n??Chang'e 3 (China)\\r\\n\\r\\n??Surveyor program (USA)\\r\\n??Apollo program (USA)\\r\\n\\r\\nA Moon landing is the arrival of a spacecraft on the surface of the Moon. This includes both manned and unmanned (robotic) missions. The first human-made object to reach the surface of the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 mission, on 13 September 1959.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States' Apollo 11 was the first manned mission to land on the Moon, on 20 July 1969.[4] There have been six manned U.S. landings (between 1969 and 1972) and numerous unmanned landings, with no soft landings happening from 22 August 1976 until 14 December 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, the United States is the only country to have successfully conducted manned missions to the Moon, with the last departing the lunar surface in December 1972.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the unsuccessful attempt by the Luna 1 to land on the moon in 1959, the Soviet Union performed the first hard (unpowered) moon landing later that same year with the Luna 2 spacecraft, a feat the U.S. duplicated in 1962 with Ranger 4. Since then, twelve Soviet and U.S. spacecraft have used braking rockets to make soft landings and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface, between 1966 and 1976. In 1966 the USSR accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the Luna 9 and Luna 13 missions. The U.S. followed with five unmanned Surveyor soft landings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Soviet Union achieved the first unmanned lunar soil sample return with the Luna 16 probe on 24 September 1970. This was followed by Luna 20 and Luna 24 in 1972 and 1976, respectively. Following the failure at launch in 1969 of the first Lunokhod, Luna E-8 No.201, the Luna 17 and Luna 21 were successful unmanned lunar rover missions in 1970 and 1973.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany missions were failures at launch.  In addition, several unmanned landing missions achieved the Lunar surface but were unsuccessful, including: Luna 15, Luna 18, and Luna 23 all crashed on landing; and the U.S. Surveyor 4 lost all radio contact only moments before its landing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recently, other nations have crashed spacecraft on the surface of the Moon at speeds of around 8,000 kilometres per hour (5,000?mph), often at precise, planned locations. These have generally been end-of-life lunar orbiters that, because of system degradations, could no longer overcome perturbations from lunar mass concentrations (\\"masscons\\") to maintain their orbit. Japan's lunar orbiter Hiten impacted the Moon's surface on 10 April 1993. The European Space Agency performed a controlled crash impact with their orbiter SMART-1 on 3 September 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) performed a controlled crash impact with its Moon Impact Probe (MIP) on 14 November 2008. The MIP was an ejected probe from the Indian Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter and performed remote sensing experiments during its descent to the lunar surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1 executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009. The rover mission Chang'e 3 was launched on 1 December 2013 and soft-landed on 14 December.\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of twelve men have landed on the Moon. This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a Lunar Module on each of six NASA missions across a 41-month period starting on 20 July 1969 UTC, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11, and ending on 14 December 1972 UTC with Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt on Apollo 17. Cernan was the last to step off the lunar surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the Command Module. The last three missions had a rover for increased mobility.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to go to the Moon, a spacecraft must first leave the gravity well of the Earth. The only practical way of accomplishing this currently is with a rocket. Unlike other airborne vehicles such as balloons or jets, a rocket is the only known form of propulsion which can continue to increase its speed at high altitudes in the vacuum outside the Earth's atmosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon approach of the target moon, a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity. In order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about 160 kilometres per hour (99?mph) and be ruggedized to withstand a \\"hard landing\\" impact, or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a \\"soft landing\\" (which is the only viable option with human occupants). The first three attempts by the U.S. to perform a successful hard moon landing with a ruggedized seismometer package in 1962 all failed.[5] The Soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in 1966, followed only months later by the first unmanned soft lunar landing by the U.S.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe speed of a crash landing on its surface is typically between 70 and 100% of the escape velocity of the target moon, and thus this is the total velocity which must be shed from the target moon's gravitational attraction for a soft landing to occur. For Earth's Moon, the escape velocity is 2.38 kilometres per second (1.48?mi/s).[6] The change in velocity (referred to as a delta-v) is usually provided by a landing rocket, which must be carried into space by the original launch vehicle as part of the overall spacecraft. An exception is the soft moon landing on Titan carried out by the Huygens probe in 2005. As the moon with the thickest atmosphere, landings on Titan may be accomplished by using atmospheric entry techniques that are generally lighter in weight than a rocket with equivalent capability.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Soviets succeeded in making the first crash landing on the Moon in 1959.[7]  Crash landings[8] may occur because of malfunctions in a spacecraft, or they can be deliberately arranged for vehicles which do not have an onboard landing rocket. There have been many such moon crashes, often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface. For example, during the Apollo program the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V moon rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the lunar module were deliberately crashed on the Moon several times to provide impacts registering as a moonquake on seismometers that had been left on the lunar surface. Such crashes were instrumental in mapping the internal structure of the Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo return to Earth, the escape velocity of the Moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the gravity well of the Moon. Rockets must be used to leave the Moon and return to space. Upon reaching Earth, atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the kinetic energy of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing.[citation needed] These functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations. Any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the Moon's surface by a moon landing rocket, increasing the latter's required size. The Moon departure rocket, larger moon landing rocket and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and parachutes must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle, greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intense efforts devoted in the 1960s to achieving first an unmanned and then ultimately a manned moon landing become easier to understand in the political context of its historical era. World War II  had introduced many new and deadly innovations including blitzkrieg-style surprise attacks used in the invasion of Poland and in the attack on Pearl Harbor; the V-2 rocket, a ballistic missile which killed thousands in attacks on London and Antwerp; and the atom bomb, which killed hundreds of thousands in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the 1950s, tensions mounted between the two ideologically opposed superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union that had emerged as victors in the conflict, particularly after the development by both countries of the hydrogen bomb.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilly Ley wrote in 1957 that a rocket to the Moon \\"could be built later this year if somebody can be found to sign some papers\\".[9] On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 as the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth and so initiated the Space Race. This unexpected event was a source of pride to the Soviets and shock to the U.S., who could now potentially be surprise attacked by nuclear-tipped Soviet rockets in under 30 minutes.[citation needed]   Also, the steady beeping of the radio beacon aboard Sputnik 1 as it passed overhead every 96 minutes was widely viewed on both sides[citation needed]  as effective propaganda to Third World countries demonstrating the technological superiority of the Soviet political system compared to that of the U.S. This perception was reinforced by a string of subsequent rapid-fire Soviet space achievements. In 1959, the R-7 rocket was used to launch the first escape from Earth's gravity into a solar orbit, the first crash impact onto the surface of the Moon, and the first photography of the never-before-seen far side of the Moon. These were the Luna 1, Luna 2, and Luna 3 spacecraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. response to these Soviet achievements was to greatly accelerate previously existing military space and missile projects and to create a civilian space agency, NASA. Military efforts were initiated to develop and produce mass quantities of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that would bridge the so-called missile gap and enable a policy of deterrence to nuclear war with the Soviets known as mutual assured destruction or MAD. These newly developed missiles were made available to civilians of NASA for various projects (which would have the added benefit of demonstrating the payload, guidance accuracy and reliabilities of U.S. ICBMs to the Soviets).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile NASA stressed peaceful and scientific uses for these rockets, their use in various lunar exploration efforts also had secondary goal of realistic, goal-oriented testing of the missiles themselves and development of associated infrastructure,[citation needed] just as the Soviets were doing with their R-7.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, historical records were released to allow the true accounting of Soviet lunar efforts. Unlike the U.S. tradition of assigning a particular mission name in advance of a launch, the Soviets assigned a public \\"Luna\\" mission number only if a launch resulted in a spacecraft going beyond Earth orbit. The policy had the effect of hiding Soviet Moon mission failures from public view. If the attempt failed in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon, it was frequently (but not always) given a \\"Sputnik\\" or \\"Cosmos\\" Earth-orbit mission number to hide its purpose. Launch explosions were not acknowledged at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast to Soviet lunar exploration triumphs in 1959, success eluded initial U.S. efforts to reach the Moon with the Pioneer and Ranger programs. Fifteen consecutive U.S. unmanned lunar missions over a six-year period from 1958 to 1964 all failed their primary photographic missions;[10][11] however, Rangers 4 and 6 successfully repeated the Soviet lunar impacts as part of their secondary missions.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nFailures included three U.S. attempts[5][12][14] in 1962 to hard land small seismometer packages released by the main Ranger spacecraft. These surface packages were to use retrorockets to survive landing, unlike the parent vehicle, which was designed to deliberately crash onto the surface. The final three Ranger probes performed successful high altitude lunar reconnaissance  photography missions during intentional crash impacts between 2.62 and 2.68 kilometres per second (9,400 and 9,600?km/h).[15][16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThree different designs of Pioneer lunar probes were flown on three different modified ICBMs. Those flown on the Thor booster modified with an Able upper stage carried an infrared image scanning television system with a resolution of 1 milliradian to study the Moon's surface, an ionization chamber to measure radiation in space, a diaphragm/microphone assembly to detect micrometeorites, a magnetometer, and temperature-variable resistors to monitor spacecraft internal thermal conditions. The first, a mission managed by the United States Air Force, exploded during launch; all subsequent Pioneer lunar flights had NASA as the lead management organization. The next two returned to Earth and burned up upon reentry into the atmosphere after achieved maximum altitudes of around 110,000 kilometres (68,000?mi) and 1,450 kilometres (900?mi), far short of the roughly 400,000 kilometres (250,000?mi) required to reach the vicinity of the Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nNASA then collaborated with the United States Army's Ballistic Missile Agency to fly two extremely small cone-shaped probes on the Juno ICBM, carrying only photocells which would be triggered by the light of the Moon and a lunar radiation environment experiment using a Geiger-Mller tube detector. The first of these reached an altitude of only around 100,000 kilometres (62,000?mi), serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the Van Allen radiation belts before reentering Earth's atmosphere. The second passed by the Moon at a distance of more than 60,000 kilometres (37,000?mi), twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on-board scientific instruments, yet still becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to reach a solar orbit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final Pioneer lunar probe design consisted of four \\"paddlewheel\\" solar panels extending from a one-meter diameter spherical spin-stabilized spacecraft body that was equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the poles, record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, study radiation, measure magnetic fields, detect low frequency electromagnetic waves in space and use a sophisticated integrated propulsion system for maneuvering and orbit insertion as well. None of the four spacecraft built in this series of probes survived launch on its Atlas ICBM outfitted with an Able upper stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the unsuccessful Atlas-Able Pioneer probes, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory embarked upon an unmanned spacecraft development program whose modular design could be used to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions. The interplanetary versions were known as Mariners; lunar versions were Rangers. JPL envisioned three versions of the Ranger lunar probes: Block I prototypes, which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high Earth orbit that came nowhere near the Moon; Block II, which would try to accomplish the first Moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package; and Block III, which would crash onto the lunar surface without any braking rockets while taking very high resolution wide-area photographs of the Moon during their descent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ranger 1 and 2 Block I missions were virtually identical.[18][19] Spacecraft experiments included a Lyman-alpha telescope, a rubidium-vapor magnetometer, electrostatic analyzers, medium-energy-range particle detectors, two triple coincidence telescopes, a cosmic-ray integrating ionization chamber, cosmic dust detectors, and scintillation counters. The goal was to place these Block I spacecraft in a very high Earth orbit with an apogee of 110,000 kilometres (68,000?mi) and a perigee of 60,000 kilometres (37,000?mi).[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom that vantage point, scientists could make direct measurements of the magnetosphere over a period of many months while engineers perfected new methods to routinely track and communicate with spacecraft over such large distances. Such practice was deemed vital to be assured of capturing high-bandwidth television transmissions from the Moon during a one-shot fifteen-minute time window in subsequent Block II and Block III lunar descents. Both Block I missions suffered failures of the new Agena upper stage and never left low Earth parking orbit after launch; both burned up upon reentry after only a few days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first attempts to perform a Moon landing took place in 1962 during the Rangers 3, 4 and 5 missions flown by the United States.[5][12][14] All three Block II missions basic vehicles were 3.1?m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact-limiter, 650?mm in diameter, a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a retrorocket with a thrust of 5,050 pounds-force (22.5?kN),[12] and a gold- and chrome-plated hexagonal base 1.5?m in diameter. This lander (code-named Tonto) was designed to provide impact cushioning using an exterior blanket of crushable balsa wood and an interior filled with incompressible liquid freon. A 42?kg (56 pounds) 30-centimetre-diameter (0.98?ft) metal payload sphere floated and was free to rotate in a liquid freon reservoir contained in the landing sphere[citation needed].\\r\\n\\r\\nThis payload sphere contained six silver-cadmium batteries to power a fifty-milliwatt radio transmitter, a temperature sensitive voltage controlled oscillator to measure lunar surface temperatures, and a seismometer that was designed with sensitivity high enough to detect the impact of a 5?lb (2.3?kg) meteorite on the opposite side of the Moon. Weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere. After landing, plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere. The batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere. Various mission constraints limited the landing site to Oceanus Procellarum on the lunar equator, which the lander ideally would reach 66 hours after launch.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo cameras were carried by the Ranger landers, and no pictures were to be captured from the lunar surface during the mission. Instead, the 3.1 metres (10?ft) Ranger Block II mother ship carried a 200-scan-line television camera which was to capture images during the free-fall descent to the lunar surface. The camera was designed to transmit a picture every 10 seconds.[12] Seconds before impact, at 5 and 0.6 kilometres (3.11 and 0.37?mi) above the lunar surface, the Ranger mother ships took picture (which may be viewed here).\\r\\n\\r\\nOther instruments gathering data before the mother ship crashed onto the Moon were a gamma ray spectrometer to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter. The radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid-fueled braking rocket overboard from the Block II mother ship. The braking rocket was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at 330 metres (1,080?ft) above the surface and separate, allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface[citation needed].\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Ranger 3, failure of the Atlas guidance system and a software error aboard the Agena upper stage combined to put the spacecraft on a course that would miss the Moon. Attempts to salvage lunar photography during a flyby of the Moon were thwarted by in-flight failure of the onboard flight computer. This was probably because of prior heat sterilization of the spacecraft by keeping it above the boiling point of water for 24 hours on the ground, to protect the Moon from being contaminated by Earth organisms. Heat sterilization was also blamed for subsequent in-flight failures of the spacecraft computer on Ranger 4 and the power subsystem on Ranger 5. Only Ranger 4 reached the Moon in an uncontrolled crash impact on the far side of the Moon.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nHeat sterilization was discontinued for the final four Block III Ranger probes.[citation needed] These replaced the Block II landing capsule and its retrorocket with a heavier, more capable television system to support landing site selection for upcoming Apollo manned Moon landing missions. Six cameras were designed to take thousands of high-altitude photographs in the final twenty-minute period before crashing on the lunar surface. Camera resolution was 1,132 scan lines, far higher than the 525 lines found in a typical U.S. 1964 home television. While Ranger 6 suffered a failure of this camera system and returned no photographs despite an otherwise successful flight, the subsequent Ranger 7 mission to Mare Cognitum was a complete success.\\r\\n\\r\\nBreaking the six-year string of failures in U.S. attempts to photograph the Moon at close range, the Ranger 7 mission was viewed as a national turning point and instrumental in allowing the key 1965 NASA budget appropriation to pass through the United States Congress intact without a reduction in funds for the Apollo manned Moon landing program. Subsequent successes with Ranger 8 and Ranger 9 further buoyed U.S. hopes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luna 9 spacecraft, launched by the Soviet Union, performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February, 1966. Airbags protected its 99 kilograms (218?lb) ejectable capsule which survived an impact speed of over 15 metres per second (54?km/h).[20] Luna 13 duplicated this feat with a similar Moon landing on 24 December 1966. Both returned panoramic photographs that were the first views from the lunar surface.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nLuna 16 was the first robotic probe to land on the Moon and safely return a sample of lunar soil back to Earth.[22] It represented the first lunar sample return mission by the Soviet Union, and was the third lunar sample return mission overall, following the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. This mission was later successfully repeated by Luna 20 (1972) and Luna 24 (1976).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1970 and 1973 two Lunokhod (\\"Moonwalker\\") robotic lunar rovers were delivered to the Moon, where they successfully operated for 10 and 4 months respectively, covering 10.5?km (Lunokhod 1) and 37?km (Lunokhod 2). These rover missions were in operation concurrently with the Zond and Luna series of Moon flyby, orbiter and landing missions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. robotic Surveyor program was part of an effort to locate a safe site on the Moon for a human landing and test under lunar conditions the radar and landing systems required to make a true controlled touchdown. Five of Surveyor's seven missions made successful unmanned Moon landings. Surveyor 3 was visited two years after its Moon landing by the crew of Apollo 12. They removed parts of it for examination back on Earth to determine the effects of long-term exposure to the lunar environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin four months of each other in early 1966 the Soviet Union and the United States had accomplished successful Moon landings with unmanned spacecraft. To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon. These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming manned landers with their much greater weight.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the Luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a 50 kilometres (31?mi)-per-hour ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 Ranger landing attempts and their planned 160 kilometres (99?mi)-per-hour impacts than with the Surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar-controlled, adjustable-thrust retrorocket. While Luna 9 and Surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments, only Surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a manned flight. Thus as of mid-1966, the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so-called Space Race to land a man on the Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvances in other areas were necessary before manned spacecraft could follow unmanned ones to the surface of the Moon. Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit. Ranger, Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all utilized flight paths from Earth that traveled directly to the lunar surface without first placing the spacecraft in a lunar orbit. Such direct ascents use a minimum amount of fuel for unmanned spacecraft on a one-way trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, manned vehicles need additional fuel after a lunar landing to enable a return trip back to Earth for the crew. Leaving this massive amount of required Earth-return fuel in lunar orbit until it is used later in the mission is far more efficient than taking such fuel down to the lunar surface in a Moon landing and then hauling it all back into space yet again, working against lunar gravity both ways. Such considerations lead logically to a lunar orbit rendezvous mission profile for a manned Moon landing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly, beginning in mid-1966 both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. naturally progressed into missions which featured lunar orbit operations as a necessary prerequisite to a manned Moon landing. The primary goals of these initial unmanned orbiters were extensive photographic mapping of the entire lunar surface for the selection of manned landing sites and, for the Soviets, the checkout of radio communications gear that would be used in future soft landings.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn unexpected major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast volumes of dense materials beneath the surface of the Moon's maria. Such mass concentrations (\\"mascons\\") can send a manned mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a Moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe. Mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly disturb the orbits of low-altitude satellites around the Moon, making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years.\\r\\n\\r\\nControlling the location of impact for spent lunar orbiters can have scientific value. For example, in 1999 the NASA Lunar Prospector orbiter was deliberately targeted to impact a permanently shadowed area of Shoemaker Crater near the lunar south pole. It was hoped that energy from the impact would vaporize suspected shadowed ice deposits in the crater and liberate a water vapor plume that would be detectable from Earth. No such plume was observed. However, a small vial of ashes from the body of pioneer lunar scientist Eugene Shoemaker was delivered by the Lunar Prospector to the crater named in his honor ÿ currently the only human remains on the Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuna 10 became the first spacecraft to orbit the Moon on 3 April 1966.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is possible to aim a spacecraft from Earth so that it will loop around the Moon and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit, following the so-called free return trajectory. Such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and Earth return are not required. However, a manned circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges above and beyond those found in a manned low-Earth-orbit mission, offering valuable lessons in preparation for a manned Moon landing. Foremost among these are mastering the demands of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere upon returning from the Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nManned Earth-orbiting vehicles such as the Space Shuttle return to Earth from speeds of around 17,000 miles per hour (27,000?km/h; 7,600?m/s). Due to the effects of gravity, a vehicle returning from the Moon hits Earth's atmosphere at a much higher speed of around 25,000 miles per hour (40,000?km/h; 11,000?m/s). The g-loading on astronauts during the resulting deceleration can be at the limits of human endurance even during a nominal reentry. Slight variations in the vehicle flight path and reentry angle during a return from the Moon can easily result in fatal levels of deceleration force.\\r\\n\\r\\nAchieving a manned circumlunar loop flight prior to a manned lunar landing became a primary goal of the Soviets with their Zond spacecraft program. The first three Zonds were unmanned planetary probes; after that, the Zond name was transferred to a completely separate manned program. The initial focus of these later Zonds was extensive testing of required high-speed reentry techniques. This focus was not shared by the U.S., who chose instead to bypass the stepping stone of a manned circumlunar loop mission and never developed a separate spacecraft for this purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitial manned spaceflights in the early 1960s placed a single person in low Earth orbit during the Soviet Vostok and U.S. Mercury programs. A two-flight extension of the Vostok program known as Voskhod effectively used Vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve Soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in 1964 and spacewalks in early 1965. These capabilities were later demonstrated by the U.S. in ten Gemini low Earth orbit missions throughout 1965 and 1966, using a totally new second-generation spacecraft design that had little in common with the earlier Mercury. These Gemini missions went on to prove critical techniques for orbital rendezvous and docking that were crucial to a manned lunar landing mission profile.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the end of the Gemini program, the Soviets Union began flying their second-generation Zond manned spacecraft in 1967 with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the Moon and returning him immediately to Earth. The Zond spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational Proton launch rocket, unlike the parallel Soviet manned Moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third-generation Soyuz spacecraft requiring development of the advanced N-1 booster. The Soviets thus believed they could achieve a manned Zond circumlunar flight years before a U.S. manned lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory. However, significant development problems delayed the Zond program and the success of the U.S. Apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the Zond effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Zond, Apollo Moon flights were generally launched on a free return trajectory that would return them to Earth via a circumlunar loop in the event that a Service Module malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit as planned. This option was implemented after an explosion aboard the Apollo 13 mission in 1970, which is the only manned circumlunar loop mission flown to date.\\r\\n\\r\\nZond 5 was the first spacecraft to carry life from Earth to the vicinity of the Moon and return, initiating the final lap of the Space Race with its payload of turtles, insects, plants and bacteria. Despite the failure suffered in its final moments, the Zond 6 mission was reported by Soviet media as being a success as well. Although hailed worldwide as remarkable achievements, both of these Zond missions flew off-nominal reentry trajectories resulting in deceleration forces that would have been fatal to human crewmembers had they been aboard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result, the Soviets secretly planned to continue unmanned Zond tests until their reliability to support manned flight had been demonstrated. However, due to NASA's continuing problems with the lunar module, and because of CIA reports of a potential Soviet manned circumlunar flight in late 1968, NASA fatefully changed the flight plan of Apollo 8 from an Earth-orbit lunar module test to a lunar orbit mission scheduled for late December 1968.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early December 1968 the launch window to the Moon opened for the Soviet launch site in Baikonur, giving the USSR their final chance to beat the US to the Moon. Cosmonauts went on alert and asked to fly the Zond spacecraft then in final countdown at Baikonur on the first manned trip to the Moon. Ultimately, however, the Soviet Politburo decided the risk of crew death was unacceptable given the combined poor performance to that point of Zond/Proton and so scrubbed the launch of a manned Soviet lunar mission. Their decision proved to be a wise one, since this unnumbered Zond mission was destroyed in another unmanned test when it was finally launched several weeks later.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time flights of the third generation U.S. Apollo spacecraft had begun. Far more capable than the Zond, the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth. The Apollo 8 mission carried out the first manned trip to the Moon on 24 December 1968, certifying the Saturn V booster for manned use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. Apollo 10 then performed a full dress rehearsal of a manned Moon landing in May 1969. This mission orbited within 47,400 feet (14.4?km) altitude above the lunar surface, performing necessary low-altitude mapping of trajectory-altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module that was too overweight to allow a successful landing. With the failure of the unmanned Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt Luna 15 in July 1969, the stage was set for Apollo 11.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlans for manned Moon exploration originated during the Eisenhower administration. In a series of mid-1950s articles in Collier's magazine, Wernher von Braun had popularized the idea of a manned expedition to the Moon to establish a lunar base. A manned Moon landing posed several daunting technical challenges to the US and USSR. Besides guidance and weight management, atmospheric re-entry without ablative overheating was a major hurdle. After the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik, von Braun promoted a plan for the United States Army to establish a military lunar outpost by 1965.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the early Soviet successes, especially Yuri Gagarin's flight, US President John F. Kennedy looked for a US project that would capture the public imagination. He asked Vice President Lyndon Johnson to make recommendations on a scientific endeavor that would prove US world leadership. The proposals included non-space options such as massive irrigation projects to benefit the Third World. The Soviets, at the time, had more powerful rockets than the United States, which gave them an advantage in some kinds of space mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvances in US nuclear weapon technology had led to smaller, lighter warheads, and consequently, rockets with smaller payload capacities. By comparison, Soviet nuclear weapons were much heavier, and the powerful R-7 rocket was developed to carry them. More modest potential missions such as flying around the Moon without landing or establishing a space lab in orbit (both were proposed by Kennedy to von Braun) were determined to offer too much advantage to the Soviets, since the US would have to develop a heavy rocket to match the Soviets. A Moon landing, however, would capture world imagination while functioning as propaganda.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohnson had championed the US manned space program ever since the Sputnik scare, sponsoring the legislation which created NASA when he was in the Senate in 1958. When Kennedy asked him in 1961 to research the best manned space achievement to counter the Soviets' lead, Johnson responded that the US had an even chance of beating the USSR to a manned lunar landing, but not for anything less. Kennedy seized on Apollo as the ideal focus for efforts in space. He ensured continuing funding, shielding space spending from the 1963 tax cut, but diverting money from other NASA scientific projects. This last dismayed NASA's leader, James E. Webb, who perceived the need for NASA's support from the scientific community.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Moon landing required development of the large Saturn V launch vehicle, which achieved a perfect record of zero catastrophic failures or launch vehicle-caused mission failures, in thirteen launches.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the program to succeed, its proponents would have to defeat criticism from politicians on the left, who wanted more money spent on social programs, and on those on the right, who favored a more military project. By emphasizing the scientific payoff and playing on fears of Soviet space dominance, Kennedy and Johnson managed to swing public opinion: by 1965, 58 percent of Americans favored Apollo, up from 33 percent two years earlier. After Johnson became President in 1963, his continuing defense of the program allowed it to succeed in 1969, as Kennedy planned.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoviet leader Nikita Khrushchev said in October 1963 that the USSR was \\"not at present planning flight by cosmonauts to the Moon,\\" while insisting that the Soviets had not dropped out of the race. Only after another year would the USSR fully commit itself to a Moon-landing attempt, which ultimately failed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, Kennedy had suggested various joint programs, including a possible Moon landing by Soviet and U.S. astronauts and the development of better weather-monitoring satellites. Khrushchev, sensing an attempt by Kennedy to steal Russian space technology, rejected the idea: if the USSR went to the Moon, it would go alone. Sergey Korolev, the Soviet space program's chief designer, had started promoting his Soyuz craft and the N1 launcher rocket that would have the capability of carrying out a manned Moon landing.\\r\\n\\r\\nKhrushchev directed Korolev's design bureau to arrange further space firsts by modifying the existing Vostok technology, while a second team started building a completely new launcher and craft, the Proton booster and the Zond, for a manned cislunar flight in 1966. In 1964 the new Soviet leadership gave Korolev the backing for a Moon landing effort and brought all manned projects under his direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Korolev's death and the failure of the first Soyuz flight in 1967, the co-ordination of the Soviet Moon landing program quickly unraveled. The Soviets built a landing craft and selected cosmonauts for the mission that would have placed Aleksei Leonov on the Moon's surface, but with the successive launch failures of the N1 booster in 1969, plans for a manned landing suffered first delay and then cancellation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA program of automated return vehicles was begun, in the hope of being the first to return lunar rocks.  This had several failures.  It eventually succeeded with Luna 16.[23]  But this had little impact, because the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 lunar landings and rock returns had already taken place by then.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn total, twenty-four U.S. astronauts have traveled to the Moon. Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of free return trajectory; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of manned Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut Alan Bean is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike other international rivalries, the Space Race has remained unaffected in a direct way regarding the desire for territorial expansion. After the successful landings on the Moon, the U.S. explicitly disclaimed the right to ownership of any part of the Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Richard Nixon had speechwriter William Safire prepare a condolence speech for delivery in the event that Armstrong and Aldrin became marooned on the Moon's surface and could not be rescued.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1951, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke forecast that man would reach the Moon by 1978.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 16 August 2006, the Associated Press reported that NASA is missing the original Slow-scan television tapes (which were made before the scan conversion for conventional TV) of the Apollo 11 Moon walk. Some news outlets have mistakenly reported that the SSTV tapes were found in Western Australia, but those tapes were only recordings of data from the Apollo 11 Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nScientists believe the six American flags planted by astronauts have been bleached white because of more than 40 years of exposure to solar radiation.[28] Using LROC images, five of the six American flags are still standing and casting shadows at all of the sites, except Apollo 11.[29] Astronaut Buzz Aldrin reported that the flag was blown over by the exhaust from the ascent engine during liftoff of Apollo 11.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nLaunched on 24 January 1990, 11:46 UTC. At the end of its mission, the Japanese lunar orbiter Hiten was commanded to crash into the lunar surface and did so on 10 April 1993 at 18:03:25.7 UT (11 April 03:03:25.7 JST).[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nLunar Prospector was launched on 7 January 1998. The mission ended on 31 July 1999, when the orbiter was deliberately crashed into a crater near the lunar south pole after the presence of water ice was successfully detected.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nLaunched 27 September 2003, 23:14 UTC from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. At the end of its mission, the ESA lunar orbiter SMART-1 performed a controlled crash into the Moon, at about 2?km/s. The time of the crash was 3 September 2006, at 5:42 UTC.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nSELENE or Kaguya was launched on 14 September 2007.  After successfully orbiting the Moon for a year and eight months, the main orbiter was instructed to impact on the lunar surface near the crater Gill at 18:25 UTC on 10 June 2009.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1, launched 24 October 2007, 10:05 UTC, executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009, 20:44 GMT, after a 16-month mission.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nChandrayaan-1 was launched on 22 October 2008, 00:52 UTC. The impactor, the Moon Impact Probe, impacted near Shackleton Crater at the south pole of the lunar surface at 14 November 2008, 20:31 IST.[35] Chandrayaan-2 is scheduled for launch in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe LCROSS data collecting shepherding spacecraft was launched together with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) on 18 June 2009 on board an Atlas V rocket with a Centaur upper stage. On 9 October 2009, at 11:31 UTC, the Centaur upper stage impacted the lunar surface, releasing the kinetic energy equivalent of detonating approximately 2 tons of TNT (8.86 GJ).[36] Six minutes later at 11:37 UTC, the LCROSS shepherding spacecraft also impacted the surface.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe GRAIL mission consisted of two small spacecraft: GRAIL A (Ebb), and GRAIL B (Flow). They were launched on 10 September 2011 on board a Delta II rocket. GRAIL A separated from the rocket about nine minutes after launch, and GRAIL B followed about eight minutes later.[38][39] The first probe entered orbit on 31 December 2011 and the second followed on 1 January 2012.[40] The two spacecraft impacted the Lunar surface on 17 December 2012.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nLADEE was launched on 7 September 2013.[42] The mission ended on 18 April 2014, when the spacecraft's controllers intentionally crashed LADEE into the far side of the Moon,[43][44] which, later, was determined to be near the eastern rim of Sundman V crater.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 14 December 2013 at 13:12 UTC[47] Chang'e 3 soft-landed a rover on the Moon. This was the first lunar soft landing since Luna 24 on 22 August 1976.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nProgress in space exploration has recently broadened the phrase moon landing to include other moons in the Solar System as well. The Huygens probe of the CassiniÿHuygens mission to Saturn performed a successful unmanned moon landing on Titan in 2005. Similarly, the Soviet probe Phobos 2 came within 120?mi (190?km) of performing an unmanned moon landing on Mars' moon Phobos in 1989 before radio contact with that lander was suddenly lost. A similar Russian sample return mission called Fobos-Grunt (\\"grunt\\" means \\"soil\\" in Russian) launched in November 2011, but stalled in low Earth orbit. There is widespread interest in performing a future moon landing on Jupiter's Europa moon to drill down and explore the possible liquid water ocean beneath its icy surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nChina is planning to land another rover and collect samples in the Chang'e 4 mission and return lunar soil samples by 2018 in the Chang'e 5 mission.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nISRO, the Indian National Space agency, is planning a second version of Chandrayaan named Chandrayaan 2. According to former ISRO Chairman G. Madhavan Nair, \\"The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) hopes to land two rovers ÿ one Indian and another Russian ÿ on the Moon in 2018, as a part of its second Chandrayaan mission. The rover will be designed to move on wheels on the lunar surface, pick up samples of soil or rocks, do on-site chemical analysis and send the data to the mother-spacecraft Chandrayaan II, which will be orbiting above. Chandrayaan II will transmit the data to Earth.\\"  The payloads have already been finalized.[50][51] ISRO has mentioned that due to weight restrictions it will not be carrying any overseas payloads on this mission. The lander weight is projected to be 1,250?kg, and the spacecraft will be launched by the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nRussia's Luna-Glob 1 is expected to be launched in 2018.[52] In 2007 the head of the Russian Space Agency announced plans to send cosmonauts to the Moon by 2025 and establish a permanent robotically operated base there in 2027ÿ2032.[53] In 2015, Roscosmos stated that Russia plans to place a cosmonaut on the Moon by 2030, leaving Mars to NASA. The purpose is to work jointly with NASA and avoid another Space Race.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lunar Precursor Robotic Program (LPRP) is a program of robotic spacecraft missions which NASA will use to prepare for future Moon landings.[55] Three orbiters have been launched in the program, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), and the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), launched in 2013, but no Moon landings are scheduled yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Google Lunar X Prize competition offers a $20?million award for the first privately funded team to land a robotic probe on the Moon. Like the Ansari X Prize before it, the competition aims to advance the state of the art in private space exploration.[56] Of the several competing teams, Puli Space Technologies at one time (2012) planned to launch in 2014[57][needs update]\\r\\nand Astrobotic Technology plans to launch in the second half of 2016 with their own rover plus another team's lunar rovers from Hakuto.[58][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2019, a consortium of Vodafone, Audi and PT Scientists are planning a moon landing. The mission is to launch a lander and two small rovers to the moon from Cape Canaveral, Florida on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during the 50th-anniversary year of NASA's Apollo 11 moon landing.[60] Nokia will assist to setup a LTE network in moon to manage lunar terrestrial communication system of the mission.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany conspiracy theorists hold that the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax;[62] however, empirical evidence is readily available to show that manned moon landings did indeed occur. Anyone on Earth with an appropriate laser and telescope system can bounce laser beams off three retroreflector arrays left on the Moon by Apollo 11,[63] 14 and 15, verifying deployment of the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment at historically documented Apollo Moon landing sites and so proving equipment constructed on Earth was successfully transported to the surface of the Moon. In addition, in August 2009 NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter began to send back high resolution photos of the Apollo landing sites. These photos show not only the large Descent Stages of the lunar landers left behind but also tracks of the astronauts' walking paths in the lunar dust.[64]","input":"When did man last walk on the moon?"},{"output":"at least 2000 BC","context":"","input":"When was it discovered that lead was poisonous?"},{"output":"a contemporary, domestic setting","context":"The Mrode Altarpiece[A] (or Annunciation Triptych) is an oil on oak panel triptych, now in The Cloisters, in New York City. It is unsigned and undated, but attributed to the workshop of the Early Netherlandish painter Robert Campin.[B] The three panels represent, from left to right, the donors kneeling in prayer in a garden, the moment of the Annunciation to Mary, which is set in a contemporary, domestic setting, and Saint Joseph, a carpenter with the tools of his trade. The many elements of religious symbolism include the lily and fountain (symbolising the purity of Mary), and the Holy Spirit represented by the rays of light coming falling from the left hand window.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt historian's interest in the Mrode Altarpiece focuses mainly on the central panel, which was completed after 1422, likely between 1425 and 1428, by a member of Campin's workshop.[C]  The outer panels are later additions by a workshop member, probably on request by the donor who sought to elevate the central panel to a triptych and place himself in the pictorial space. The wings contain views of the city of Lige, in today's Belgium. A version of the center panel in Brussels is earlier, and maybe Campin's original panel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe triptych is a founding and important work in the then emerging late Gothic, Early Netherlandish style, and has been described as a \\"milestone between two periods; it at once summarizes the medieval tradition and lays the foundation for the development of modern painting\\".[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York triptych has been at times attributed to the young Rogier van der Weyden[2] It is today accepted as belonging to a group of paintings associated with the Master of Flmalle, assumed to be Robert Campin,[D] a mentor of Jan van Eyck.[3] There is another version of the Annunciation panel in Brussels, slightly earlier but damaged,[4] which may represent the original version by Campin.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical examination of the wood panels suggest that the New York triptych was completed by a number of hands. The wood of the central panel is different and earlier to that of the wings, while the hinging further suggest that the central panel was not intended as part of a triptych. The central panel is likely a copy of an earlier composition by Campin, while the wings were probably a later commissioned by the donor, who presumably wished that they were attached to the main panel to form a devotional altarpiece, probably (given its size) for private devotion.[5] Areas of the panels have been reworked; both the female doner and bearded man on the left wing were painted over landscape, while the window behind the Virgin was originally painted in gold.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nCampbell has dismissed the triptych's association with the Flemalle group, and thus Robert Campin. He describes the Mrode as \\"incoherent in design\\", in that it lacks spatial continuity between the panels, a trait most noticeable in the Seilern Triptych.[4] In addition the open sky seen through the windows in the central is incongruous in point of view with the street scene in the donor panel. He further notes the poor command of perspective in the donor panel, and notes that it is \\"unfortunate that a line of one of the mortar courses in the garden wall disappear into the donor's mouth\\".[7] Campbell disregards the wing panels as pedestrian and by lesser hands, thrown together at the will of the donor. He gives prominence to the Brussels panel, which he cautiously attributes to the Master of Flmalle.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe triptych was commissioned for private and domestic use; the central panel is a relatively small 64 G 63?cm and each wing measures 65 G 27?cm. Each panel has a steep perspective, in that the viewer seems to be looking down on the figures from an elevated point of view. In other respects the perspective is underdeveloped; neither the Virgin nor Gabriel seem to rest on solid ground, while the female donor seems to hover, and  barely able to fit into the space she is positioned in.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe panels The panels are well preserved, with little over-paint, glossing, dirt layers or paint losses.[5] They are almost entirely in oil; and establish many of the inventions that were to make the technique so successful and adaptable over the following centuries.[9] The serenity of the works is achieved, in part, through the dominance of pale, opaque white, red and blue hues. The panels are relatively small; the at times minute attention to detail calls to mind the focus of contemporary miniatures, of the kind seem in the two illuminated manuscripts in the central panel.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe panel is one of the earliest representations of the Annunciation to Mary in a contemporary middle-class Northern European interior,[9] perhaps a dining room. This is Campin's main innovation; showing a reading Madonna, with unbound hair in a then familiar setting; an image that lead to many adoptions, most famously Rogier van der Weyden's Reading Magdalen.[10] The colours of the central panel are dominated by the cool grays of the plaster and the brown of the timber wall.[11] The lower half is characterised by warmer and deeper brownish greens and reds.[2] Art historian suggest that the success of the panel is due to the contrast between the warm reds of the Virgin's robe and the pale blue hues of the archangel Gabriel's vestment.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe perspective is very steep and unevenly distributed. The angle of the table in particular is illogical. Art historian Lorne Campbell describes these distortions as \\"disturbing\\".[7] The panel shows the moment before the traditional scene, as Mary, absorbed in her book, is still unaware of the presence of Gabriel.[12] Mary is in a red gown rather than the more usual blue. She is in a relaxed pose, reading from a book of hours, her hair unbound. Unusually for a medieval depiction of the Annunciation, the dove of the Holy Spirit is not included. Instead he is represented by the extinguished light of the candle, and the beam of light falling from the window to the left, which carries the Christ Child holding a cross.[13] \\r\\nThe Christ Child flies down towards Mary from the left oculus, signifying her impregnation by God the Father. He gazes directly at her and holds a cross. The folding-table contains a recently extinguished candle,[14] and shows coiling smoke and a still glowing wick. This maybe a reference to the Holy Spirit, who, according to some late medieval writers, descended to the apostles \\"like a puff of wind\\".[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe white lily in a Tuscan earthenware jug[9] on the table represents Mary's virginity and purity, as does the white, ocher towel. The jug contains a series of enigmatic letters in Latin and Hebraic, deciphered by some art historians as De Campyn, that is the artist's signature.[15] An opened manuscript is positioned on a green velvet book pouch. Unusually the book is positioned next to the Virgin rather than the shelf. The pages seem worn and handled, indicating that it has been well read.[15] It has been suggested that the book reflects the Carthusian Ludolf of Saxony's idea of the  secluded life of the Virgin - that she earlier lived with \\"the Holy Scriptures as her sole companion\\".[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe right hand half of the back wall holds three windows, one of which contains a lattice screen.[2] The beams of the ceiling are supported by a series of corbels.[17] The sky visible through the windows is a later addition, which was painted over an earlier gold ground. The armorial shields are also later additions.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe donor and his wife are shown kneeling in prayer are in the left panel, looking through a half-open door into the Virgin's Hortus conclusus.[2] The door presents a continuity oddity; although it can be seen opening into the Virgins room from the left panel, no such door entrance is visible in the center panel. Addressing this, the art historians Rose-Marie and Rainer Hagen suppose that the donor is \\"imagining that she has entered into his house. From without, he has opened the door; with his own eyes he beholds the Mother of God and petitions her for a family\\".[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant or attendant dressed in a festive outfit[19] appears to be an later addition by a different artist, perhaps after the donor's marriage.[20] The space contains an unlocked entrance which leads to a minutely detailed street scene.[14] The panel is the more striking as the door leading into the Virgin's chamber is wide open, hugely presumptuous for even a mid-fifteenth century commission, and suggesting access to the gates of heaven.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe donors are identifiable as bourgeoisie from nearby Mechelen, and are documented in Tournai in 1427, identifiable from the coat of arms in the stained glass window of the central panel.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is assumed that this panel was a later commission to Campin's workshop, not part of the original single panel design. There has been speculation that it was completed by the young Rogier van der Weyden.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe altarpiece was commissioned either by the businessman Jan Engelbrecht, or the Cologne-born merchant Peter Engelbrecht and his wife Margarete Scrynmaker.[23][24] Engelbrecht translates from German as \\"angel brings\\", while Scrynmaker means \\"cabinet maker\\", the latter perhaps influencing the choice of Joseph in the right hand panel.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Joseph, a carpenter by trade, occupies the right-hand panel. He is shown at work, carving a mousetrap. An unusual feature is that, although Mary and Joseph did not marry until after the Annunciation, they are apparently living together and sharing the same space. Joseph is shown with the tools of his craft, including an ax, saw and rod, laid out across a table, and a small footstool, sitting before a fire of burning logs. Joseph's presence is probably intended to invoke  10 :15 from the Book of Isaiah: \\"Shall the ax boast itself against him that heweth there-\\r\\nwith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it?\\r\\nas if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if\\r\\nthe staff should lift up itself as if was it were no wood.\\"[25] Isaiah's words were intended as incentatory and revolutionary, were followed by a treatise for the salvation of Israel, and protested against an Assyrian king he considered considered boorish and vainglorious.[25] Given this, Joseph is seen by art historians as a reassuring presence, warding the devil from the center panel.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nJoseph is shown as an old man[26] wearing an eggplant coloured coat and blue turban, in a panel characterised by dark and warm colours, and framed by the shadows from the window shutters.[2] He works on a mouse trap, probably intended as a symbol of the cross at the Crucifixion,[27] in that it represents an imagined but literal capture of the Devil, said to have held a man in ransom because of the sin of Adam.[28] In some scripts, Christ's naked flesh was served as bait for the devil; \\"He rejoiced in Christ's death, like a bailiff of death. What he rejoiced in was then his own undoing. The cross of the Lord was the devil's mousetrap; the bait by which he was caught was the Lord's death.\\"[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe background contains a cityscape, probably fictitious, showing the spires of two churches, one of which is now lost, the churches of St. Pierre (left) and Sainte Croix (right) in Liege.[E][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Iconography contains complex religious symbolism, although their extent and exact nature is debated ÿ Meyer Schapiro pioneered the study of the symbolism of the mousetrap,[30] and Erwin Panofsky later extended, or perhaps over-extended, the analysis of symbols to cover many more details of the furniture and fittings. Similar debates exist for many Early Netherlandish paintings, and a number of the details seen for the first time here reappear in later Annunciations by other artists. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe symbolic elements in the central panel mostly relate to the Annunciation, the Mass and the sacrament of the Eucharist.[31] Mary sits on the floor to show her humility. The scroll and book in front of Mary symbolize the Old and the New Testaments, and the roles Mary and the Christ child played in the fulfillment of prophecy.  The lilies in the earthenware vase on the table represent Mary's virginity. Other symbols of her purity include the enclosed garden (Hortus conclusus),[23] and the white towel, while the small windows to the right, and  the half-closed windows at the rear, serve to emphasise the quite, virginal life she has lived.[18][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lion finials on the bench may have a symbolic role (referring to the Seat of Wisdom, or throne of Solomon) ÿ this feature is often seen in other paintings, religious or secular (like Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait).  The arrangements for washing at the back of the room, which are considered unusual for a domestic interior, may relate to the similar arrangements of a piscina for the officiating priest to wash his hands during Mass.  The sixteen sides of the table may allude to the sixteen main Hebrew prophets; the table is usually seen as an altar, and the archangel Gabriel wears the vestments of a deacon.[32] The basin may represent both the purity of Virgin, and the cleansing of the Christian act of baptism.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the right-hand panel, Saint Joseph, a carpenter, has constructed a mouse trap symbolizing Christ's trapping and defeat of the devil, a metaphor used three times by Saint Augustine: \\"The cross of the Lord was the devil's mousetrap; the bait by which he was caught was the Lord's death\\"[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIts early history is obscure. The triptych was owned by the aristocratic Belgian Arenberg and Mrode families from 1820 to 1849 before reaching the art market, and has been in the collection of the Cloisters, New York since 1956. Until its acquisition it had been in private collection for many years and thus inaccessible to both scholars and the public. Its purchase was funded by John D. Rockefeller Jr. and was described at the time as a \\"major event for the history of collecting in the United States\\".[35]","input":"What is the setting for campin's annunciation?"},{"output":"Instagram","context":"This list contains the top 25 accounts with the most followers on the social photo-sharing platform Instagram.[1] As of February 2018, the most followed user is Instagram's own account, with over 232 million followers.

Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history.[1][2][3] In the short-term, France lost thousands of her countrymen in the form of migrs, or emigrants who wished to escape political tensions and save their lives.   A number of individuals settled in the neighboring countries (chiefly Great Britain, Germany, Austria, and Prussia), however quite a few also went to the United States.  The displacement of these Frenchmen led to a spread of French culture, policies regulating immigration, and a safe haven for Royalists and other counterrevolutionaries to outlast the violence of the French Revolution.  The long-term impact on France was profound, shaping politics, society, religion and ideas, and polarizing politics for more than a century.  The closer other countries were, the greater and deeper was the French impact, bringing liberalism and the end of many feudal or traditional laws and practices.[4][5]  However, there was also a conservative counter-reaction that defeated Napoleon, reinstalled the Bourbon kings, and in some ways reversed the new reforms.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the new nations created by the French were abolished and returned to prewar owners in 1814. However, Frederick Artz emphasizes the benefits the Italians gained from the French Revolution: \\r\\n\\r\\nLikewise in Switzerland the long-term impact of the French Revolution has been assessed by Martin: \\r\\n\\r\\nThe greatest impact came in France itself. In addition to effects similar to those in Italy and Switzerland, France saw the introduction of the principle of legal equality, and the downgrading of the once powerful and rich Catholic Church to just a bureau controlled by the government. Power became centralized in Paris, with its strong bureaucracy and an army supplied by conscripting all young men. French politics were permanently polarizednew names were given, 'left' and 'right' for the supporters and opponents of the principles of the Revolution.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe changes in France were enormous; some were widely accepted and others were bitterly contested into the late 20th century.[8]  Before the Revolution, the people had little power or voice. The kings had so thoroughly centralized the system that most nobles spent their time at Versailles, and played only a small direct role in their home districts. Thompson says that the kings had:\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first year of revolution, this power had been stripped away. The king was a figurehead, the nobility had lost all their titles and most of their land, the Church lost its monasteries and farmlands, bishops, judges and magistrates were elected by the people, the army was almost helpless, with military power in the hands of the new revolutionary National Guard. The central elements of 1789 were the slogan \\"Libert, galit, fraternit\\" and \\"The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen\\", which Lefebvre calls \\"the incarnation of the Revolution as a whole.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long-term impact on France was profound, shaping politics, society, religion and ideas, and polarizing politics for more than a century. Historian Fran?ois Aulard writes:\\r\\n\\r\\nEurope was wracked by two decades of war revolving around France's efforts to spread its revolutionary ideals, and the opposition of reactionary royalty, led by Britain and Austria.  War broke out in 1792 as Austria and Prussia invaded France, but were defeated at the Battle of Valmy (1792).\\r\\n\\r\\nTo escape political tensions and save their lives, a number of individuals, mostly men, emigrated from France. Many settled in neighboring countries (chiefly Great Britain, Germany, Austria, and Prussia), and quite a few went to the United States.  The presence of these thousands of Frenchmen of varying socioeconomic backgrounds who had just fled a hotbed of revolutionary activity posed a problem for the nations that extended refuge to the migrants.  The fear was that they brought with them a plot to disrupt the political order, which did lead to increased regulation and documentation of the influx of immigrants in neighboring countries.  Still, most nations such as Britain remained magnanimous and welcomed the French.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn foreign affairs, the French Army at first was quite successful.  It conquered the Austrian Netherlands (approximately modern-day Belgium) and turned it into another province of France.  It conquered the Dutch Republic (the present Netherlands), and made it a puppet state. It took control of the German areas on the left bank of the Rhine River and set up a puppet regime. It conquered Switzerland and most of Italy, setting up a series of puppet states.  The result was glory for France, and an infusion of much needed money from the conquered lands, which also provided direct support to the French Army. However the enemies of France, led by Britain and funded by the inexhaustible British Treasury, formed a Second Coalition in 1799 (with Britain joined by Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and Austria).  It scored a series of victories that rolled back French successes, and The French Army trapped in Egypt. Napoleon himself slipped through the British blockade in October 1799, returning to Paris.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nNapoleon conquered most of Italy in the name of the French Revolution in 1797ÿ99. He consolidated old units and split up Austria's holdings. He set up a series of new republics, complete with new codes of law and abolition of old feudal privileges. Napoleon's Cisalpine Republic was centered on Milan. Genoa the city became a republic while its hinterland became the Ligurian Republic. The Roman Republic was formed out of the papal holdings while the pope himself was sent to France. The Neapolitan Republic was formed around Naples, but it lasted only five months before the enemy forces of the Coalition recaptured it.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1805 he formed the Kingdom of Italy, with himself as king and his stepson as viceroy. In addition, France turned the Netherlands into the Batavian Republic, and Switzerland into the Helvetic Republic. All these new countries where satellites of France, and had to pay large subsidies to Paris, as well as provide military support for Napoleon's wars. Their political and administrative systems were modernized, the metric system introduced, and trade barriers reduced. Jewish ghettos were abolished. Belgium and Piedmont became integral parts of France.[14][15]The new nations were abolished and returned to prewar owners in 1814. However, Artz emphasizes the benefits the Italians gained from the French Revolution: \\r\\n\\r\\nOtto Dann and John Dinwiddy report, \\"It has long been almost a truism of European history that the French Revolution gave a great \\r\\nstimulus to the growth of modern nationalism.\\"[16]  Nationalism was emphasized by historian Carlton J.H. Hayes as a major result of the French Revolution across Europe. The impact on French nationalism was profound. Napoleon became such a heroic symbol of the nation that the glory was easily picked up by his nephew, who was overwhelmingly elected president (and later became Emperor Napoleon III).[17] The influence was great in the hundreds of small German states and elsewhere, where it was  either inspired by the French example or in reaction against it.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the Revolution, Britain supported the constitutional monarchy, up until they de-instated the king Louis XVI. Britain saw minority support for the French Revolution, but the majority, especially the elite, were strongly opposed. Britain led and funded the series of coalitions that fought France from 1793 to 1815, and then restored the Bourbons.  Edmund Burke was the chief spokesman for the opposition.[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Ireland, the effect was to transform what had been an attempt by Protestant settlers to gain some autonomy into a mass movement led by the Society of United Irishmen involving Catholics and Protestants. It stimulated the demand for further reform throughout Ireland, especially in Ulster. The upshot was a revolt in 1798, led by Wolfe Tone, that was crushed by Britain.[22][23] This revolt is seen as the foundation for modern Irish republicanism, which eventually led to the partition of Ireland and independence for 26 of its 32 counties.\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman reaction to the Revolution swung from favorable at first to antagonistic. At first it brought liberal and democratic ideas, the end of guilds, of serfdom and of the Jewish ghetto. It brought economic freedoms and agrarian and legal reform. German intellectuals celebrated the outbreak, hoping to see the triumph of Reason and  The Enlightenment.  There were enemies as well, as the royal courts in Vienna and Berlin denounced the overthrow of the king and the threatened spread of notions of liberty, equality, and fraternity.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1793, the execution of the French king and the onset of the Terror disillusioned the \\"Bildungsbrgertum\\" (educated middle classes). Reformers said the solution was to have faith in the ability of Germans to reform their laws and institutions in peaceful fashion.[24][25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Prussia was humiliated by Napoleon opinion swung against France and stimulated and shaped German nationalism.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance took direct control of the Rhineland 1794ÿ1814 and radically and permanently liberalized the government, society and economy.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French swept away centuries worth of outmoded restrictions and introduced unprecedented levels of efficiency. The chaos and barriers in a land divided and subdivided among many different petty principalities gave way to a rational, simplified, centralized system controlled by Paris and run by Napoleon's relatives. The most important impact came from the abolition of all feudal privileges and historic taxes, the introduction of legal reforms of the Napoleonic Code, and the reorganization of the judicial and local administrative systems. The economic integration of the Rhineland with France increased prosperity, especially in industrial production, while business accelerated with the new efficiency and lowered trade barriers. The Jews were liberated from the ghetto. One sour point was the hostility of the French officials toward the Roman Catholic Church, the choice of most of the residents. Much of South Germany felt a similar but more muted influence of the French Revolution, while in Prussia and areas to the east there was far less impact.[29] The reforms were permanent. Decades later workers and peasants in the Rhineland often appealed to Jacobinism to oppose unpopular government programs, while the intelligentsia demanded the maintenance of the Napoleonic Code (which was stayed in effect for a century).[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French invaded Switzerland and turned it into an ally known as the \\"Helvetic Republic\\" (1798ÿ1803). The interference with localism and traditional liberties was deeply resented, although some modernizing reforms took place.[31][32] Resistance was strongest in the more traditional Catholic bastions, with armed uprisings breaking out in spring 1798 in the central part of Switzerland. Alois Von Reding, a powerful Swiss general, led an army of 10,000 men from the Cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden against the French. This resulted in the Swiss regaining control of Lucerne, however due to the sheer greatness in size of the French army, Von Reding's movement was eventually suppressed. The French Army suppressed the uprisings but support for revolutionary ideals steadily declined, as the Swiss resented their loss of local democracy, the new taxes, the centralization, and the hostility to religion.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe instability of France resulted in the creation of two different revolutionary groups with different ideologies of revolt: The aristocrats, seeking the restoration of the Old Swiss Confederacy and a section of the population wanting a coup. Furthermore, Switzerland became a battleground between the armies of France, Austria and Russia. Ultimately, this instability, frequent coups within the government and the eventual Bourla-papey forced Napoleon to sign the Act of Medallion which led to the fall of the Helvetic Republic and the restoration of the Confederacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long-term impact of the French Revolution has been assessed by Martin: \\r\\n\\r\\nFrench invaded the territory of modern-day Belgium and controlled it between 1794ÿ1814. The French imposed reforms and incorporated the territory into France. New rulers were sent in by Paris. Belgian men were drafted into the French wars and heavily taxed. Nearly everyone was Catholic, but the Church was repressed. Resistance was strong in every sector, as Belgian nationalism emerged to oppose French rule. The French legal system, however, was adopted, with its equal legal rights, and abolition of class distinctions. Belgium now had a government bureaucracy selected by merit.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAntwerp regained access to the sea and grew quickly as a major port and business center. France promoted commerce and capitalism, paving the way for the ascent of the bourgeoisie and the rapid growth of manufacturing and mining.  In economics, therefore, the nobility declined while the middle class Belgian entrepreneurs  flourished because of their inclusion in a large market, paving the way for Belgium's leadership role after 1815 in the Industrial Revolution on the Continent.[36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance turned the Netherlands into a puppet state that had to pay large indemnities.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Denmark adopted liberalizing reforms in line with those of the French Revolution, with no direct contact. Danes were aware of French ideas and agreed with them, as it moved from Danish absolutism to a liberal constitutional system between 1750ÿ1850. The change of government in 1784 was caused by a power vacuum created when King Christian VII took ill, and power shifted to the crown prince (who later became King Frederik VI) and reform-oriented landowners. In contrast to Old Regime France, agricultural reform was intensified in Denmark, serfdom was abolished and civil rights were extended to the peasants, the finances of the Danish state were healthy, and there were no external or internal crises.  That is, reform was gradual and the regime itself carried out agrarian reforms that had the effect of weakening absolutism by creating a class of independent peasant freeholders. Much of the initiative came from well-organized liberals who directed political change in the first half of the 19th century.[39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Sweden, King Gustav III (reigned 1771ÿ92) was an enlightened despot, who  weakened the nobility and  promoted numerous major social reforms.  He felt the Swedish monarchy could survive and flourish by achieving a coalition with the newly emerged middle classes against the nobility.  He was close to King Louis XVI so he was disgusted with French radicalism. Nevertheless, he decided to promote additional antifeudal reforms  to strengthen his hand among the middle classes.[41]  When the king was assassinated in 1792 his brother Charles became regent, but real power was with Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm, who bitterly opposed the French Revolution and all its supporters. Under King Gustav IV Adolf, Sweden joined various coalitions against Napoleon, but was badly defeated and lost much of its territory, especially Finland and Pomerania.  The king was overthrown by the army, which in 1810 decided to bring in one of Napoleon's marshals, Bernadotte, as the heir apparent and army commander.  He had a Jacobin background and was well-grounded in revolutionary principles, but put Sweden in the coalition that opposed Napoleon. Bernadotte served as a quite conservative king Charles XIV John of Sweden (1818ÿ44).[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French Revolution fished widespread American support in its early phase, but when the king was executed it polarized American opinion and played a major role in shaping American politics.[43] President George Washington declared neutrality in the European wars, but the polarization shaped the First Party System. In 1793, the first \\"Democratic societies\\" were formed. They supported the French Revolution in the wake of the execution of the king. The word \\"democrat\\" was proposed by French Ambassador Citizen Genet for the societies, which he was secretly subsidizing. The emerging Federalists led by Alexander Hamilton began to ridicule the supporters of Thomas Jefferson as \\"democrats\\". Genet now began mobilizing American voters using French money, for which he was expelled by President Washington.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter President Washington denounced the societies as unrepublican, they faded away. In 1793, as war broke out in Europe, the Jeffersonian Republican Party favored France and pointed to the 1778 treaty that was still in effect. Washington and his unanimous cabinet (including Jefferson) decided the treaty did not bind the U.S. to enter the war, since they stopped being in favor of the Revolution after they executed the King; instead Washington proclaimed neutrality.[45] Under President Adams, a Federalist, an undeclared naval war took place with France in 1798ÿ99, called the \\"Quasi War\\". Jefferson became president in 1801, but was hostile to Napoleon as a dictator and emperor. Nevertheless, he did seize the opportunity to purchase Louisiana in 1803.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe broad similarities but different experiences between the French and American revolutions lead to a certain kinship between France and the United States, with both countries seeing themselves as pioneers of liberty and promoting republican ideals. [47] This bond manifesting itself in such exchanges as the gift of the Statue of Liberty by France. [48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe call for modification of society was influenced by the revolution in France, and once the hope for change found a place in the hearts of the Haitian people, there was no stopping the radical reformation that was occurring.[49] The Enlightenment ideals and the initiation of the French Revolution were enough to inspire the Haitian Revolution, which evolved into the most successful and comprehensive slave rebellion.[49] Just as the French were successful in transforming their society, so were the Haitians. On April 4, 1792, The French National Assembly granted freedom to slaves in Haiti[50] and the revolution culminated in 1804; Haiti was an independent nation solely of freed peoples.[51] The activities of the revolutions sparked change across the world. France's transformation was most influential in Europe, and Haiti's influence spanned across every location that continued to practice slavery. John E. Baur honors Haiti as home of the most influential Revolution in history.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs early as 1810, the term \\"liberal\\" was coined in Spanish politics to indicate supporters of the French Revolution. This usage passed to Latin America and animated the independence movement against Spain. In the nineteenth century \\"Liberalism\\" was the dominant element in Latin American political thought. French liberal ideas were especially influential in Mexico, particularly as seen through the writings of Alexis de Tocqueville, Benjamin Constant and douard Ren de Laboulaye. The Latin American political culture oscillated between two opposite poles: the traditional, as based on highly specific personal and family ties to kin groups, communities, and religious identity; and the modern, based on impersonal ideals of individualism, equality, legal rights, and secularism or anti-clericalism. The French Revolutionary model was the basis for the modern viewpoint, as explicated in Mexico in the writings of Jos Mara Luis Mora (1794ÿ1850).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Mexico, modern liberalism was best expressed in the Liberal Party, the Constitution of 1857, the policies of Benito Jurez, and finally by Francisco I. Madero's democratic movement leading to the Revolution of 1911.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe impact of the French Revolution on the Middle East came in terms of the political and military impact of Napoleon's invasion; and in the eventual influence of revolutionary and liberal ideas and revolutionary movements or rebellions. In terms of Napoleon's invasion in 1798, the response by Ottoman officials was highly negative. They warned that traditional religion would be overthrown. Long-standing Ottoman friendship with France ended. Sultan Selim III immediately realized how far behind his empire was, and started to modernize both his army and his governmental system. In Egypt itself, the ruling elite of Mamluks was permanently displaced, speeding the reforms.  In intellectual terms, the immediate impact of the French Revolutionary ideas was nearly invisible, but there was a long-range influence on liberal ideas and the ideal of legal equality, as well as the notion of opposition to a tyrannical government. In this regard, the French Revolution brought such influential themes as constitutionalism, parliamentarianism, individual liberty, legal equality, and the sense of ethnic nationalism.  These came to fruition about 1876.[54]","input":"What was one effect of the french revolution?"},{"output":"18 characters","context":"Tracking numbers are numbers given to packages when they are shipped.

Known as the \\"Founder of Hip-Hop\\" and \\"Father of Hip-Hop\\", Campbell began playing hard funk records of the sort typified by James Brown as an alternative both to the violent gang culture of the Bronx and to the nascent popularity of disco in the 1970s. Campbell began to isolate the instrumental portion of the record, which emphasized the drum beatthe \\"break\\"and switch from one break to another.\\r\\nUsing the same two turntable set-up of disco DJs, Campbell used two copies of the same record to elongate the break. This breakbeat DJing, using hard funk and records with Latin percussion, formed the basis of hip hop music. Campbell's announcements and exhortations to dancers helped lead to the syncopated, rhymed spoken accompaniment now known as rapping. He called his dancers \\"break-boys\\" and \\"break-girls\\", or simply b-boys and b-girls. Campbell's DJ style was quickly taken up by figures such as Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash. Unlike them, he never made the move into commercially recorded hip hop in its earliest years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nClive Campbell was the first of six children born to Keith and Nettie Campbell in Kingston, Jamaica. While growing up, he saw and heard the sound systems of neighborhood parties called dance halls, and the accompanying speech of their DJs, known as toasting. He emigrated with his family at the age of 12 to The Bronx, New York City in November 1967,[4] where they lived at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue.\\r\\nCampbell attended the Alfred E. Smith Career and Technical Education High School in the Bronx, where his height, frame, and demeanor on the basketball court prompted the other kids to nickname him \\"Hercules\\". He began running with a graffiti crew called the Ex-Vandals, taking the name Kool Herc.[5] Herc recalls persuading his father to buy him a copy of \\"Sex Machine\\" by James Brown, a record that not a lot of his friends had, and which they would come to him to hear.[6] He and his sister, Cindy, began hosting back-to-school parties in the recreation room of their building, 1520 Sedgwick Avenue.[7] Herc's first soundsystem consisted of two turntables connected to two amplifiers and a Shure \\"Vocal Master\\" PA system with 2 speakers columns, on which he played records such as James Brown's \\"Give It Up or Turnit a Loose\\", Jimmy Castor's \\"It's Just Begun\\" and Booker T. & the M.G.'s' \\"Melting Pot\\".[5] With Bronx clubs struggling with street gangs, uptown DJs catering to an older disco crowd with different aspirations, and commercial radio also catering to a demographic distinct from teenagers in the Bronx, Herc's parties had a ready-made audience.[5][8][9]\\r\\nDJ Kool Herc developed the style that was the blueprint for hip hop music. Herc used the record to focus on a short, heavily percussive part in it: the \\"break\\". Since this part of the record was the one the dancers liked best, Herc isolated the break and prolonged it by changing between two record players. As one record reached the end of the break, he cued a second record back to the beginning of the break, which allowed him to extend a relatively short section of music into \\"five-minute loop of fury\\".[10] This innovation had its roots in what Herc called \\"The Merry-Go-Round,\\" a technique by which the deejay switched from break to break at the height of the party. This technique is specifically called \\"The Merry-Go-Round\\" because according to Herc, it takes one \\"back and forth with no slack.\\"[11] Herc told The New York Times that he first introduced the Merry-Go-Round into his sets in 1972.[12] The earliest known Merry-Go-Round involved playing James Brown's \\"Give It Up or Turnit a Loose\\" (with its refrain, \\"Now clap your hands! Stomp your feet!\\"), then switching from that record's break into the break from a second record, \\"Bongo Rock\\" by The Incredible Bongo Band. From the \\"Bongo Rock\\"'s break, Herc used a third record to switch to the break on \\"The Mexican\\" by the English rock band Babe Ruth.[13] Kool Herc also contributed to developing the rhyming style of hip hop by punctuating the recorded music with slang phrases, announcing: \\"Rock on, my mellow!\\" \\"B-boys, b-girls, are you ready? keep on rock steady\\" \\"This is the joint! Herc beat on the point\\" \\"To the beat, y'all!\\" \\"You don't stop!\\"[14][15] For his contributions, Herc is called a \\"founding father of hip hop,\\"[16][17] a \\"nascent cultural hero,\\"[18] and an integral part of the beginnings of hip hop by Time.[19][20]\\r\\nOn August 11, 1973, DJ Kool Herc was a disc jockey and emcee at a party in the recreation room at Sedgwick Avenue.[21] Specifically, DJ Kool Herc:\\r\\nextended an instrumental beat (breaking or scratching) to let people dance longer (break dancing) and began MC'ing (rapping) during the extended breakdancing. ... [This] helped lay the foundation for a cultural revolution.\\r\\nAccording to music journalist Steven Ivory, in 1973, Herc placed on the turntables two copies of Brown's 1970 Sex Machine album and ran \\"an extended cut 'n' mix of the percussion breakdown\\" from \\"Give It Up or Turnit Loose\\", signaling the birth of hip hop.[22]\\r\\nThe \\"b-boys\\" and \\"b-girls\\" were the dancers to Herc's breaks, who were described as \\"breaking\\". Herc has noted that \\"breaking\\" was also street slang of the time meaning \\"getting excited\\", \\"acting energetically,\\" or \\"causing a disturbance\\".[23] Herc coined the terms \\"b-boy\\", \\"b-girl,\\" and \\"breaking\\" which became part of the lexicon of what would be eventually called hip hop culture. Early Kool Herc b-boy and later DJ innovator Grandmixer DXT describes the early evolution as follows:\\r\\n\\" ... [E]verybody would form a circle and the B-boys would go into the center. At first the dance was simple: touch your toes, hop, kick out your leg. Then some guy went down, spun around on all fours. Everybody said wow and went home to try to come up with something better.\\"[14]\\r\\nIn the early 1980s, the media began to call this style \\"breakdance,\\" which in 1991 the New York Times wrote was \\"an art as demanding and inventive as mainstream dance forms like ballet and jazz.\\"[24] Since this emerging culture was still without a name, participants often identified as \\"b-boys,\\" a usage that included and went beyond the specific connection to dance, a usage that would persist in hip hop culture.[25]\\r\\nWith the mystique of his graffiti name, his physical stature, and the reputation of his small parties, Herc became a folk hero in the Bronx. He began to play at nearby clubs including the Twilight Zone[7] Hevalo, Executive Playhouse, the PAL on 183rd Street,[5] as well as at high schools such as Dodge and Taft.[26] Rapping duties were delegated to Coke La Rock[27] and Theodore Puccio.[28] Herc's collective, known as The Herculoids, was augmented by Clark Kent and dancers The ##### Twins.[5] Herc took his soundsystem (the herculords) still legendary for its sheer volume[29]to the streets and parks of the Bronx. Nelson George recalls a schoolyard party:\\r\\n\\"The sun hadn't gone down yet, and kids were just hanging out, waiting for something to happen. Van pulls up, a bunch of guys come out with a table, crates of records. They unscrew the base of the light pole, take their equipment, attach it to that, get the electricity ÿ Boom! We got a concert right here in the schoolyard and it's this guy Kool Herc. And he's just standing with the turntable, and the guys were studying his hands. There are people dancing, but there's as many people standing, just watching what he's doing. That was my first introduction to in-the-street, hip hop DJing.\\"[30]\\r\\nIn 1975, the young Grandmaster Flash, to whom Kool Herc was, in his words, \\"a hero\\", began DJing in Herc's style. By 1976, Flash and his MCs The Furious Five played to a packed Audubon Ballroom in Manhattan. Venue owners were often nervous of unruly young crowds, however, and soon sent hip hop back to the clubs, community centres and high school gymnasiums of the Bronx.[31]\\r\\nAfrika Bambaataa first heard Kool Herc in 1973. Bambaataa, at that time a general in the notorious Black Spades gang of the Bronx, obtained his own soundsystem in 1975 and began to DJ in Herc's style, converting his followers to the non-violent Zulu Nation in the process. Kool Herc began using The Incredible Bongo Band's \\"Apache\\" as a break in 1975. It became a firm b-boy favourite\\"the Bronx national anthem\\"[14]and is still in use in hip hop today.[12] Steven Hager wrote of this period:\\r\\n\\"For over five years the Bronx had lived in constant terror of street gangs. Suddenly, in 1975, they disappeared almost as quickly as they had arrived. This happened because something better came along to replace the gangs. That something was eventually called hip-hop.\\"[14]\\r\\nIn 1979, the record company executive Sylvia Robinson assembled a group she called The Sugarhill Gang and recorded \\"Rapper's Delight\\". The hit song ushered in the era of commercially released hip hop. By that year's end, Grandmaster Flash was recording for Enjoy Records. In 1980, Afrika Bambaataa began recording for Winley. By this time, DJ Kool Herc's star had faded.\\r\\nGrandmaster Flash suggests that Herc may not have kept pace with developments in techniques of cueing (lining up a record to play at a certain place on it).[32] Developments changed techniques of cutting (switching from one record to another) and scratching (moving the record by hand to and fro under the stylus for percussive effect) in the late 1970s. Herc said he retreated from the scene after being stabbed at the Executive Playhouse while trying to intercede in a fight, and the burning down of one of his venues. In 1980, Herc had stopped DJing and was working in a record shop in South Bronx.\\r\\nKool Herc appeared in Hollywood's motion picture take on hip hop, Beat Street (Orion, 1984), as himself. In the mid-1980s, his father died, and he became addicted to crack cocaine. \\"I couldn't cope, so I started medicating\\", he says of this period.[33]\\r\\nIn 1994, Herc performed on Terminator X & the Godfathers of Threatt's album, Super Bad.[5] In 2005, he wrote the foreword to Jeff Chang's book on hip hop, Can't Stop Won't Stop. In 2005 he appeared in the music video of \\"Top 5 (Dead or Alive)\\" by Jin from the album The Emcee's Properganda. In 2006, he became involved in getting Hip Hop commemorated at the Smithsonian Institution museums.[34] He participated in the 2007 Dance parade.\\r\\nSince 2007, Herc has worked in a campaign to prevent 1520 Sedgwick Avenue from being sold to developers and withdrawn from its status as a Mitchell-Lama affordable housing property.[35] In the summer of 2007, New York state officials declared 1520 Sedgwick Avenue the \\"birthplace of hip-hop\\", and nominated it to national and state historic registers.[7] The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development ruled against the proposed sale in February 2008, on the grounds that \\"the proposed purchase price is inconsistent with the use of property as a Mitchell-Lama affordable housing development\\". It is the first time they have so ruled in such a case.[36]\\r\\nAccording to a DJ Premier fan blog,[37] The Source's website[38] and other sites, DJ Kool Herc fell gravely ill in early 2011 and was said to lack health insurance.[39] He had surgery for kidney stones, with a stent placed to relieve the pressure. He needed follow-up surgery but St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, the site that performed the previous surgery, has requested that he make a deposit toward the next surgery, because he has missed several follow-up visits. The hospital said it would not turn away uninsured patients in the emergency room.[40] DJ Kool Herc and his family set up an official website on which he describes his medical issue and the larger goal of establishing the DJ Kool Herc Fund to pioneer long-term health care solutions.[41] In April 2013, Campbell recovered from surgery and moved into post-medical care.[41]","input":"Who was the jamaican born dj who is credited as being one of the founders of hip hop?"},{"output":"Sydney","context":"The history of Australia from 1788ÿ1850 covers the early colonial period of Australia's history, from the arrival in 1788 of the First Fleet of British ships at Sydney, New South Wales, who established the penal colony, the scientific exploration of the continent and later, establishment of other Australian colonies and the beginnings of representative democratic government. European colonisation would have a devastating effect on the pre-existing population of Indigenous Australians, and debate continues in the 21st century as to whether the colonisation process represented settlement, invasion, or a mixture of both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is commonly reported that the colonisation of Australia was driven by the need to address overcrowding in the British prison system, and the fact of the British losing the United States from the American Revolution; however, it was simply not economically viable to transport convicts halfway around the world for this reason alone.[1] Many convicts were either skilled tradesmen or farmers who had been convicted for trivial crimes and were sentenced to seven years transportation, the time required to set up the infrastructure for the new colony. Convicts were often given pardons prior to or on completion of their sentences and were allocated parcels of land to farm.\\r\\nSir Joseph Banks, the eminent scientist who had accompanied Lieutenant James Cook on his 1770 voyage, recommended Botany Bay as a suitable site.[2] Banks accepted an offer of assistance made by the American Loyalist James Matra in July 1783. Matra had visited Botany Bay with Banks in 1770 as a junior officer on the Endeavour commanded by James Cook. Under Banks's guidance, he rapidly produced \\"A Proposal for Establishing a Settlement in New South Wales\\" (24 August 1783), with a fully developed set of reasons for a colony composed of American Loyalists, Chinese and South Sea Islanders (but not convicts).[3]\\r\\nFollowing an interview with Secretary of State Lord Sydney in March 1784, Matra amended his proposal to include convicts as settlers.[4] Matras plan can be seen to have provided the original blueprint for settlement in New South Wales.[5] A cabinet memorandum December 1784 shows the Government had Matras plan in mind when considering the creation of a settlement in New South Wales.[5][6] The London Chronicle of 12 October 1786 said: Mr. Matra, an Officer of the Treasury, who, sailing with Capt. Cook, had an opportunity of visiting Botany Bay, is the Gentleman who suggested the plan to Government of transporting convicts to that island. The Government also incorporated into the colonisation plan the project for settling Norfolk Island, with its attractions of timber and flax, proposed by Bankss Royal Society colleagues, Sir John Call and Sir George Young.[7]\\r\\nOn 13 May 1787, the First Fleet of 11 ships and about 1,530 people (736 convicts, 17 convicts' children, 211 marines, 27 marines' wives, 14 marines' children and about 300 officers and others) under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip set sail for Botany Bay.[8][9] The Fleet of 11 vessels consisted of over a thousand settlers, including 778 convicts (192 women and 586 men).[10] A few days after arrival at Botany Bay the fleet moved to the more suitable Port Jackson where a settlement was established at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788.[11] This date later became Australia's national day, Australia Day. The colony was formally proclaimed by Governor Phillip on 7 February 1788 at Sydney. Sydney Cove offered a fresh water supply and a safe harbour, which Philip famously described as:[12]\\r\\nPhillip named the settlement after the Home Secretary, Thomas Townshend, 1st Baron Sydney (Viscount Sydney from 1789). The only people at the flag raising ceremony and the formal taking of possession of the land in the name of King George III were Phillip and a few dozen marines and officers from the Supply, the rest of the ship's company and the convicts witnessing it from on board ship. The remaining ships of the Fleet were unable to leave Botany Bay until later on 26 January because of a tremendous gale.[13] The new colony was formally proclaimed as the Colony of New South Wales on 7 February.[14]\\r\\nOn 24 January 1788 a French expedition of two ships led by Admiral Jean-Fran?ois de La Prouse had arrived off Botany Bay, on the latest leg of a three-year voyage that had taken them from Brest, around Cape Horn, up the coast from Chile to California, north-west to Kamchatka, south-east to Easter Island, north-west to Macao, and on to the Philippines, the Friendly Isles, Hawaii and Norfolk Island.[15] Though amicably received, the French expedition was a troublesome matter for the British, as it showed the interest of France in the new land.\\r\\nNevertheless, on 2 February Lieutenant King, at Phillip's request, paid a courtesy call on the French and offered them any assistance they may need.[13] The French made the same offer to the British, as they were much better provisioned than the British and had enough supplies to last three years.[13] Neither of these offers was accepted. On 10 March[13] the French expedition, having taken on water and wood, left Botany Bay, never to be seen again. Phillip and La Prouse never met. La Prouse is remembered in a Sydney suburb of that name. Various other French geographical names along the Australian coast also date from this expedition.\\r\\nGovernor Phillip was vested with complete authority over the inhabitants of the colony. Phillip's personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony. Phillip and several of his officers ÿ most notably Watkin Tench ÿ left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were few and far between. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney ÿ many \\"professional criminals\\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the Second Fleet which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its \\"passengers\\" through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the Third Fleet appalled Phillip. From 1791 however, the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.[16]\\r\\nIn 1792, two French ships, La Recherche and L'Esprance anchored in a harbour near Tasmania's southernmost point they called Recherche Bay. This was at a time when Britain and France were trying to be the first to discover and colonise Australia. The expedition carried scientists and cartographers, gardeners, artists and hydrographers who, variously, planted, identified, mapped, marked, recorded and documented the environment and the people of the new lands that they encountered at the behest of the fledgling Socit D'Histoire Naturelle.\\r\\nWhite settlement began with a consignment of English convicts, guarded by a detachment of the Royal Marines, a number of whom subsequently stayed in the colony as settlers. Their view of the colony and their place in it was eloquently stated by Captain David Collins: \\"From the disposition to crimes and the incorrigible character of the major part of the colonists, an odium was, from the first, illiberally thrown upon the settlement; and the word \\"Botany Bay\\" became a term of reproach that was indiscriminately cast upon every one who resided in New South Wales. But let the reproach light upon those who have used it as such... if the honour of having deserved well of one's country be attainable by sacrificing good name, domestic comforts, and dearest connections in her service, the officers of this settlement have justly merited that distinction\\".[17]\\r\\nWhen the Bellona transport came to anchor in Sydney Cove on 16 January 1793, she brought with her the first immigrant free settlers. They were: Thomas Rose, a farmer from Dorset, his wife and four children; he was allowed a grant of 120 acres; Frederic Meredith, who had formerly been at Sydney with HMS Sirius; Thomas Webb (who had also been formerly at Sydney with the Sirius), his wife, and his nephew, Joseph Webb; Edward Powell, who had formerly been at Sydney with the Juliana transport, and who married a free woman after his arrival. Thomas Webb and Edward Powell each received a grant of 80 acres; and Joseph Webb and Frederic Meredith received 60 acres each.\\r\\nThe conditions they had come out under were that they should be provided with a free passage, be furnished with agricultural tools and implements by the Government, have two years' provisions, and have grants of land free of expense. They were likewise to have the labour of a certain number of convicts, who were also to be provided with two years' rations and one year's clothing from the public stores. The land assigned to them was some miles to the westward of Sydney, at a place named by the settlers, \\"Liberty Plains\\". It is now the area covered mainly by the suburbs of Strathfield and Homebush.\\r\\nOne in three convicts transported after 1798 was Irish, about a fifth of whom were transported in connection with the political and agrarian disturbances common in Ireland at the time. While the settlers were reasonably well-equipped, little consideration had been given to the skills required to make the colony self-supporting ÿ few of the first wave convicts had farming or trade experience (nor the soldiers), and the lack of understanding of Australia's seasonal patterns saw initial attempts at farming fail, leaving only what animals and birds the soldiers were able to shoot. The colony nearly starved, and Phillip was forced to send a ship to Batavia (Jakarta) for supplies. Some relief arrived with the Second Fleet in 1790, but life was extremely hard for the first few years of the colony.\\r\\nConvicts were usually sentenced to seven or fourteen years' penal servitude, or \\"for the term of their natural lives\\". Often these sentences had been commuted from the death sentence, which was technically the punishment for a wide variety of crimes. Upon arrival in a penal colony, convicts would be assigned to various kinds of work. Those with trades were given tasks to fit their skills (stonemasons, for example, were in very high demand) while the unskilled were assigned to work gangs to build roads and do other such tasks. Female convicts were usually assigned as domestic servants to the free settlers, many being forced into prostitution.[18]\\r\\nWhere possible, convicts were assigned to free settlers who would be responsible for feeding and disciplining them; in return for this, the settlers were granted land. This system reduced the workload on the central administration. Those convicts who weren't assigned to settlers were housed at barracks such as the Hyde Park Barracks or the Parramatta female factory.\\r\\nConvict discipline was harsh; convicts who would not work or who disobeyed orders were punished by flogging, being put in stricter confinement (e.g. leg-irons), or being transported to a stricter penal colony. The penal colonies at Port Arthur and Moreton Bay, for instance, were stricter than the one at Sydney, and the one at Norfolk Island was strictest of all. Convicts were assigned to work gangs to build roads, buildings, and the like. Female convicts, who made up 20% of the convict population, were usually assigned as domestic help to soldiers. Those convicts who behaved were eventually issued with ticket of leave, which allowed them a certain degree of freedom. Those who saw out their full sentences or were granted a pardon usually remained in Australia as free settlers, and were able to take on convict servants themselves.\\r\\nIn 1789 former convict James Ruse produced the first successful wheat harvest in NSW. He repeated this success in 1790 and, because of the pressing need for food production in the colony, was rewarded by Governor Phillip with the first land grant made in New South Wales. Ruse's 30 acre grant at Rose Hill, near Parramatta, was aptly named 'Experiment Farm'.[19] This was the colony's first successful farming enterprise, and Ruse was soon joined by others. The colony began to grow enough food to support itself, and the standard of living for the residents gradually improved.\\r\\nIn 1804 the Castle Hill convict rebellion was led by around 200 escaped, mostly Irish convicts, although it was broken up quickly by the New South Wales Corps. On 26 January 1808, there was a military rebellion against Governor Bligh led by John Macarthur. Following this, Governor Lachlan Macquarie was given a mandate to restore government and discipline in the colony. When he arrived in 1810, he forcibly deported the NSW Corps and brought the 73rd regiment to replace them.\\r\\n[24]\\r\\nIn October 1795 George Bass and Matthew Flinders, accompanied by William Martin sailed the boat Tom Thumb out of Port Jackson to Botany Bay and explored the Georges River further upstream than had been done previously by the colonists. Their reports on their return led to the settlement of Banks' Town.[25] In March 1796 the same party embarked on a second voyage in a similar small boat, which they also called the Tom Thumb.[26] During this trip they travelled as far down the coast as Lake Illawarra, which they called Tom Thumb Lagoon. They discovered and explored Port Hacking. In 1798ÿ99, Bass and Flinders set out in a sloop and circumnavigated Tasmania, thus proving it to be an island.[27]\\r\\nAboriginal guides and assistance in the European exploration of the colony were common and often vital to the success of missions. In 1801ÿ02 Matthew Flinders in The Investigator lead the first circumnavigation of Australia. Aboard ship was the Aboriginal explorer Bungaree, of the Sydney district, who became the first person born on the Australian continent to circumnavigate the Australian continent.[27] Previously, the famous Bennelong and a companion had become the first people born in the area of New South Wales to sail for Europe, when, in 1792 they accompanied Governor Phillip to England and were presented to King George III.[27]\\r\\nIn 1813, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth succeeded in crossing the formidable barrier of forested gulleys and sheer cliffs presented by the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, by following the ridges instead of looking for a route through the valleys. At Mount Blaxland they looked out over \\"enough grass to support the stock of the colony for thirty years\\", and expansion of the British settlement into the interior could begin.[28]\\r\\nIn 1824 the Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane, commissioned Hamilton Hume and former Royal Navy Captain William Hovell to lead an expedition to find new grazing land in the south of the colony, and also to find an answer to the mystery of where New South Wales's western rivers flowed. Over 16 weeks in 1824ÿ25, Hume and Hovell journeyed to Port Phillip and back. They made many important discoveries including the Murray River (which they named the Hume), many of its tributaries, and good agricultural and grazing lands between Gunning, New South Wales and Corio Bay, Victoria.[29]\\r\\nCharles Sturt led an expedition along the Macquarie River in 1828 and discovered the Darling River. A theory had developed that the inland rivers of New South Wales were draining into an inland sea. Leading a second expedition in 1829, Sturt followed the Murrumbidgee River into a 'broad and noble river', the Murray River, which he named after Sir George Murray, secretary of state for the colonies. His party then followed this river to its junction with the Darling River, facing two threatening encounters with local Aboriginal people along the way. Sturt continued down river on to Lake Alexandrina, where the Murray meets the sea in South Australia. Suffering greatly, the party had to then row back upstream hundreds of kilometres for the return journey.[30]\\r\\nSurveyor General Sir Thomas Mitchell conducted a series of expeditions from the 1830s to 'fill in the gaps' left by these previous expeditions. He was meticulous in seeking to record the original Aboriginal place names around the colony, for which reason the majority of place names to this day retain their Aboriginal titles.[31]\\r\\nThe Polish scientist/explorer Count Paul Edmund Strzelecki conducted surveying work in the Australian Alps in 1839 and became the first European to ascend Australia's highest peak, which he named Mount Kosciuszko in honour of the Polish patriot Tadeusz Kosciuszko.[32]\\r\\nTraditional Aboriginal society had been governed by councils of elders and a corporate decision-making process, but the first European-style governments established after 1788 were autocratic and run by appointed governors ÿ although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the doctrine of reception, thus notions of the rights and processes established by the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights 1689 were brought from Britain by the colonists. Agitation for representative government began soon after the settlement of the colonies.[33]\\r\\nThe Second Fleet in 1790 brought to Sydney two men who were to play important roles in the colony's future. One was D'Arcy Wentworth, whose son, William Charles, went on to be an explorer, to found Australia's first newspaper and to become a leader of the movement to abolish convict transportation and establish representative government. The other was John Macarthur, a Scottish army officer and founder of the Australian wool industry, which laid the foundations of Australia's future prosperity. Macarthur was a turbulent element: in 1808 he was one of the leaders of the Rum Rebellion against the governor, William Bligh.\\r\\nFrom about 1815 the colony, under the governorship of Lachlan Macquarie, began to grow rapidly as free settlers arrived and new lands were opened up for farming. Despite the long and arduous sea voyage, settlers were attracted by the prospect of making a new life on virtually free Crown land. From the late 1820s settlement was only authorised in the limits of location, known as the Nineteen Counties.\\r\\nMany settlers occupied land without authority and beyond these authorised settlement limits: they were known as squatters and became the basis of a powerful landowning class. As a result of opposition from the labouring and artisan classes, transportation of convicts to Sydney ended in 1840, although it continued in the smaller colonies of Van Diemen's Land (first settled in 1803, later renamed Tasmania) and Moreton Bay (founded 1824, and later renamed Queensland) for a few years more.\\r\\nThe Swan River Settlement (as Western Australia was originally known), centred on Perth, was founded in 1829. The colony suffered from a long-term shortage of labour, and by 1850 local capitalists had succeeded in persuading London to send convicts. (Transportation did not end until 1868.) New Zealand was part of New South Wales until 1840 when it became a separate colony.\\r\\nThe first governments established after 1788 were autocratic and each colony was governed by a British Governor, appointed by the British monarch. There was considerable unhappiness with the way some of the colonies were run. In most cases the administration of the early colonies was carried out by the British military. The New South Wales Corps, which was in charge of New South Wales, became known as the \\"Rum Corps\\", due to its stranglehold on the distribution of rum, which was used as a makeshift currency at the time. In New South Wales this led to the \\"Rum Rebellion\\". Although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the doctrine of reception, thus notions of the rights and processes established by the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights 1689 were brought from Britain by the colonists. Agitation for representative government began soon after the settlement of the colonies.[33]\\r\\nThe oldest legislative body in Australia, the New South Wales Legislative Council, was created in 1825 as an appointed body to advise the Governor of New South Wales. William Wentworth established the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand democratic government for New South Wales. The reformist attorney general, John Plunkett, sought to apply Enlightenment principles to governance in the colony, pursuing the establishment of equality before the law, first by extending jury rights to emancipists, then by extending legal protections to convicts, assigned servants and Aborigines. Plunkett twice charged the colonist perpetrators of the Myall Creek massacre of Aborigines with murder, resulting in a conviction and his landmark Church Act of 1836 disestablished the Church of England and established legal equality between Anglicans, Catholics, Presbyterians and later Methodists.[34]\\r\\nIn 1840, the Adelaide City Council and the Sydney City Council were established. Men who possessed 1000 pounds worth of property were able to stand for election and wealthy landowners were permitted up to four votes each in elections. Australia's first parliamentary elections were conducted for the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1843, again with voting rights (for males only) tied to property ownership or financial capacity. Voter rights were extended further in New South Wales in 1850 and elections for legislative councils were held in the colonies of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.[35]\\r\\nBy the mid-19th century, there was a strong desire for representative and responsible government in the colonies of Australia, later fed by the democratic spirit of the goldfields and the ideas of the great reform movements sweeping Europe, the United States and the British Empire. The end of convict transportation accelerated reform in the 1840s and 1850s. The Australian Colonies Government Act [1850] was a landmark development which granted representative constitutions to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania and the colonies enthusiastically set about writing constitutions which produced democratically progressive parliaments ÿ though the constitutions generally maintained the role of the colonial upper houses as representative of social and economic \\"interests\\" and all established constitutional monarchies with the British monarch as the symbolic head of state.[36]\\r\\nThe colonies relied heavily on imports from England for survival. The official currency of the colonies was the British pound, but the unofficial currency and most readily accepted trade good was rum. During this period Australian businessmen began to prosper. For example, the partnership of Berry and Wollstonecraft made enormous profits by means of land grants, convict labour, and exporting native cedar back to England.\\r\\nSince time immemorial in Australia, indigenous people had performed the rites and rituals of the animist religion of the Dreamtime. The permanent presence of Christianity in Australia however, came with the arrival of the First Fleet of British convict ships at Sydney in 1788. As a British colony, the predominant Christian denomination was the Church of England, but one-tenth of all the convicts who came to Australia on the First Fleet were Catholic, and at least half of them were born in Ireland.[37]\\r\\nA small proportion of British marines were also Catholic. Some of the Irish convicts had been Transported to Australia for political crimes or social rebellion in Ireland, so the authorities were suspicious of the minority religion for the first three decades of settlement.[38] It was therefore the crew of the French explorer La Prouse who conducted the first Catholic ceremony on Australian soil in 1788 ÿ the burial of Father Louis Receveur, a Franciscan monk, who died while the ships were at anchor at Botany Bay, while on a mission to explore the Pacific.[39]\\r\\nIn early colonial times, Church of England clergy worked closely with the governors. Richard Johnson, Anglican chaplain to the First Fleet, was charged by the governor, Arthur Phillip, with improving \\"public morality\\" in the colony, but he was also heavily involved in health and education.[40] The Reverend Samuel Marsden (1765ÿ1838) had magisterial duties, and so was equated with the authorities by the convicts. He became known as the 'floging parson' for the severity of his punishments[41]\\r\\nCatholic convicts were compelled to attend Church of England services and their children and orphans were raised by the authorities as Protestant.[42] The first Catholic priest colonists arrived in Australia as convicts in 1800 ÿ James Harold, James Dixon, and Peter O'Neill, who had been convicted for 'complicity' in the Irish 1798 Rebellion. Fr Dixon was conditionally emancipated and permitted to celebrate Mass. On 15 May 1803, in vestments made from curtains and with a chalice made of tin he conducted the first Catholic Mass in New South Wales.[42]\\r\\nThe Irish led Castle Hill Rebellion of 1804 alarmed the British authorities and Dixon's permission to celebrate Mass was revoked. Fr Jeremiah Flynn, an Irish Cistercian, was appointed as Prefect Apostolic of New Holland, and set out from Britain for the colony, uninvited. Watched by authorities, Flynn secretly performed priestly duties before being arrested and deported to London. Reaction to the affair in Britain led to two further priests being allowed to travel to the Colony in 1820 ÿ John Joseph Therry and Philip Connolly.[38] The foundation stone for the first St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney was laid on 29 October 1821 by Governor Lachlan Macquarie.\\r\\nThe absence of a Catholic mission in Australia before 1818 reflected the legal disabilities of Catholics in Britain and the difficult position of Ireland within the British Empire. The government therefore endorsed the English Benedictines to lead the early Church in the Colony.[43] The Church of England lost its legal privileges in the Colony of New South Wales by the Church Act of 1836. Drafted by the reformist attorney-general John Plunkett, the Act established legal equality for Anglicans, Catholics and Presbyterians and was later extended to Methodists.[44] Catholic missionary William Ullathorne criticised the convict system, publishing a pamphlet, The Horrors of Transportation Briefly Unfolded to the People, in Britain in 1837.[45] Laywoman Caroline Chisolm did ecumenical work to alleviate the suffering of female migrants.\\r\\nInitially, education was informal, primarily occurring in the home.[citation needed] At the instigation of the then British Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington, and with the patronage of King William IV, Australia's oldest surviving independent school, The King's School, Parramatta, was founded in 1831 as part of an effort to establish grammar schools in the colony.[46] By 1833, there were around ten Catholic schools in the Australian colonies.[38] Today one in five Australian students attend Catholic schools.[47]\\r\\nSydney's first Catholic Bishop, John Bede Polding requested a community of nuns be sent to the colony and five Irish Sisters of Charity arrived in 1838 to set about pastoral care of convict women and work in schools and hospitals before going on to found their own schools and hospitals.[48] At Polding's request, the Christian Brothers arrived in Sydney in 1843 to assist in schools. Establishing themselves first at Sevenhill, in South Australia in 1848, the Jesuits were the first religious order of priests to enter and establish houses in South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory ÿ where they established schools and missions.\\r\\nSome Australian folksongs date to this period.\\r\\nAmong the first true works of Australian literature produced over this period was the accounts of the settlement of Sydney by Watkin Tench, a captain of the marines on the First Fleet to arrive in 1788. In 1819, poet, explorer, journalist and politician William Wentworth published the first book written by an Australian: A Statistical, Historical, and Political Description of the Colony of New South Wales and Its Dependent Settlements in Van Diemen's Land, With a Particular Enumeration of the Advantages Which These Colonies Offer for Emigration and Their Superiority in Many Respects Over Those Possessed by the United States of America,[49] in which he advocated an elected assembly for New South Wales, trial by jury and settlement of Australia by free emigrants rather than convicts. In 1838 The Guardian: a tale by Anna Maria Bunn was published in Sydney. It was the first Australian novel printed and published in mainland Australia and the first Australian novel written by a woman. It is a Gothic romance.[50]\\r\\nEuropean traditions of Australian theatre also came with the First Fleet, with the first production being performed in 1789 by convicts?: The Recruiting Officer by George Farquhar.[51] Two centuries later, the extraordinary circumstances of the foundations of Australian theatre were recounted in Our Country's Good by Timberlake Wertenbaker: the participants were prisoners watched by sadistic guards and the leading lady was under threat of the death penalty. The play is based on Thomas Keneally's novel The Playmaker.[51] The Theatre Royal, Hobart, opened in 1837 and it remains the oldest theatre in Australia.[52] The Melbourne Athenaeum is one of the oldest public institutions in Australia, founded in 1839 and it served as library, school of arts and dance hall (and later became Australia's first cinema, screening The Story of the Kelly Gang, the world's first feature film in 1906).[53] The Queen's Theatre, Adelaide opened with Shakespeare in 1841 and is today the oldest theatre on the mainland.[54]\\r\\nAboriginal reactions to the sudden arrival of British settlers were varied, but often hostile when the presence of the colonisers led to competition over resources, and to the occupation by the British of Aboriginal lands. European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources led to starvation. By contrast with New Zealand, where the Treaty of Waitangi was seen to legitimise British settlement, no treaty was signed with Aborigines, who never authorised British colonisation.\\r\\nAccording to the historian Geoffrey Blainey, in Australia during the colonial period:\\r\\n\\"In a thousand isolated places there were occasional shootings and spearings. Even worse, smallpox, measles, influenza and other new diseases swept from one Aboriginal camp to another... The main conqueror of Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralisation\\".[55]\\r\\nSince the 1980s, the use of the word \\"invasion\\" to describe the British colonisation of Australia has been highly controversial. According to Australian Henry Reynolds however, government officials and ordinary settlers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries frequently used words such as \\"invasion\\" and \\"warfare\\" to describe their presence and relations with Indigenous Australians. In his book The Other Side of the Frontier,[56] Reynolds described in detail armed resistance by Aboriginal people to white encroachments by means of guerilla warfare, beginning in the eighteenth century and continuing into the early twentieth.\\r\\nIn the early years of colonisation, David Collins, the senior legal officer in the Sydney settlement, wrote of local Aborigines:\\r\\nWhile they entertain the idea of our having dispossessed them of their residences, they must always consider us as enemies; and upon this principle they [have] made a point of attacking the white people whenever opportunity and safety concurred.[57]\\r\\nIn 1847, Western Australian barrister E.W. Landor stated: \\"We have seized upon the country, and shot down the inhabitants, until the survivors have found it expedient to submit to our rule. We have acted as Julius Caesar did when he took possession of Britain.\\"[58] In most cases, Reynolds says, Aborigines initially resisted British presence. In a letter to the Launceston Advertiser in 1831, a settler wrote:\\r\\nWe are at war with them: they look upon us as enemies ÿ as invaders ÿ as oppressors and persecutors ÿ they resist our invasion. They have never been subdued, therefore they are not rebellious subjects, but an injured nation, defending in their own way, their rightful possessions which have been torn from them by force.[59]\\r\\nReynolds quotes numerous writings by settlers who, in the first half of the nineteenth century, described themselves as living in fear and even in terror due to attacks by Aborigines determined to kill them or drive them off their lands. He argues that Aboriginal resistance was, in some cases at least, temporarily effective; the Aboriginal killings of men, sheep and cattle, and burning of white homes and crops, drove some settlers to ruin. Aboriginal resistance continued well beyond the middle of the nineteenth century, and in 1881 the editor of The Queenslander wrote:\\r\\nDuring the last four or five years the human life and property destroyed by the aborigines in the North total up to a serious amount. [...] [S]ettlement on the land, and the development of the mineral and other resources on the country, have been in a great degree prohibited by the hostility of the blacks, which still continues with undiminished spirit.[60]\\r\\nReynolds argues that continuous Aboriginal resistance for well over a century belies the \\"myth\\" of peaceful settlement in Australia. Settlers in turn often reacted to Aboriginal resistance with great violence, resulting in numerous indiscriminate massacres by whites of Aboriginal men, women and children.[61] Among the most famous massacres of the early nineteenth century were the Pinjarra massacre and the Myall Creek massacre.\\r\\nFamous Aborigines who resisted British colonisation in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries include Pemulwuy and Yagan. In Tasmania, the \\"Black War\\" was fought in the first half of the nineteenth century.\\r\\nHistory of Australia:","input":"Where were the first colonial settlements in australia founded?"},{"output":"ancient times","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nCapital punishment in the United Kingdom was used from ancient times until the second half of the 20th century. The last executions in the United Kingdom were by hanging, and took place in 1964, prior to capital punishment being abolished for murder (in 1965 in Great Britain and in 1973 in Northern Ireland).  Although unused, the death penalty remained a legally defined punishment for certain offences such as treason until it was completely abolished in 1998. In 2004 the 13th Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights became binding on the United Kingdom, prohibiting the restoration of the death penalty for as long as the UK is a party to the Convention.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Samuel Romilly, speaking to the House of Commons on capital punishment in 1810, declared that \\"[there is] no country on the face of the earth in which there [have] been so many different offences according to law to be punished with death as in England\\".[2] Known as the \\"Bloody Code\\", at its height the criminal law included some 220 crimes punishable by death, including \\"being in the company of Gypsies for one month\\", \\"strong evidence of malice in a child aged 7ÿ14 years of age\\" and \\"blacking the face or using a disguise whilst committing a crime\\".  Many of these offences had been introduced to protect the property of the wealthy classes that emerged during the first half of the 18th century, a notable example being the Black Act of 1723, which created 50?capital offences for various acts of theft and poaching.[citation needed] Crimes eligible for the death penalty included shoplifting and stealing sheep, cattle, and horses, and before abolition of the death penalty for theft in 1832, \\"English law was notorious for prescribing the death penalty for a vast range of offenses as slight as the theft of goods valued at twelve pence.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst executions for murder, burglary and robbery were common, the death sentences for minor offenders were often not carried out. A sentence of death could be commuted or respited (permanently postponed) for reasons such as benefit of clergy, official pardons, pregnancy of the offender or performance of military or naval duty.[4] Between 1770 and 1830, an estimated 35,000 death sentences were handed down in England and Wales, of which 7,000 executions were carried out.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1808 Romilly had the death penalty removed for pickpockets and lesser offenders, starting a process of reform that continued over the next 50 years. The death penalty was mandatory (although it was frequently commuted by the government) until the Judgement of Death Act 1823 gave judges the power to commute the death penalty except for treason and murder. The Punishment of Death, etc. Act 1832 reduced the number of capital crimes by two-thirds. In 1832, the death penalty was abolished for theft, counterfeiting, and forgery except for the forgery of wills and certain powers of attorney.[3][6] Gibbeting was abolished in 1832 and hanging in chains was abolished in 1834. In 1837, the death penalty for forging wills and powers of attorney was abolished. The death penalty for rape was abolished in 1841.[7] In 1861, several acts of Parliament (24 & 25 Vict; c. 94 to c. 100) further reduced the number of civilian capital crimes to five: murder, treason, espionage, arson in royal dockyards, and piracy with violence; there were other offences under military law. The death penalty remained mandatory for treason and murder unless commuted by the monarch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1864ÿ66[8] concluded (with dissenting Commissioners) that there was not a case for abolition but recommended an end to public executions. This proposal was included in the Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868. From that date executions in Great Britain were carried out only in prisons. The punishment of beheading and quartering those executed for treason was abolished in 1870.[9] The last application of that punishment had been in 1820 and the last sentence to the punishment had been in 1839.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1908, the Children Act 1908 banned the execution of juveniles under the age of 16. In 1922 a new offence of Infanticide was introduced to replace the charge of murder for mothers killing their children in the first year of life. In 1930 a parliamentary Select Committee recommended that capital punishment be suspended for a trial period of five years, but no action was taken. From 1931 pregnant women could no longer be hanged (following the birth of their child) although in practice since the 18th century their sentences had always been commuted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1933 the minimum age for capital punishment was raised to 18 under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. The last known execution by the civilian courts of a person under 18 was that of Charles Dobel, 17, hanged at Maidstone together with his accomplice William Gower, 18, in January 1889. Harold Wilkins, at 16 years old, was the last juvenile sentenced to the death penalty in the United Kingdom, in 1932 for a sexually related murder, but he was reprieved due to age.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1938 the issue of the abolition of capital punishment was brought before parliament. A clause within the Criminal Justice Bill called for an experimental five-year suspension of the death penalty. When war broke out in 1939 the bill was postponed. It was revived after the war and to everyone's surprise was adopted by a majority in the House of Commons (245 to 222). In the House of Lords the abolition clause was defeated but the remainder of the bill was passed. Popular support for abolition was absent and the government decided that it would be inappropriate for it to assert its supremacy by invoking the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 over such an unpopular issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, then Home Secretary, James Chuter Ede, set up a new Royal Commission (the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, 1949ÿ1953) with instructions to determine \\"whether the liability to suffer capital punishment should be limited or modified\\". The Commission's report discussed a number of alternatives to execution by hanging (including the electric chair, gas inhalation, lethal injection, shooting, and the guillotine), but rejected them. It had more difficulty with the principle of capital punishment. Popular opinion believed that the death penalty acted as a deterrent to criminals, but the statistics within the report were inconclusive. Whilst the report recommended abolition from an ethical standpoint, it made no mention of possible miscarriages of justice. The public had by then expressed great dissatisfaction with the verdict in the case of Timothy Evans, who was tried and hanged in 1950 for murdering his infant daughter. It later transpired in 1953 that John Christie had strangled at least six women in the same house; he also confessed to killing Timothy's wife. If the jury in Evans's trial had known this, Evans may have been acquitted. There were other cases in the same period where doubts arose over convictions and subsequent hangings, such as the notorious case of Derek Bentley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commission concluded that unless there was overwhelming public support in favour of abolition, the death penalty should be retained.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1900 and 1949, 621 men and 11 women were executed in England and Wales. Ten German agents were executed during the First World War under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914,[11] and 16 spies were executed during the Second World War under the Treachery Act 1940.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1957 a number of controversial cases highlighted the issue of capital punishment again. Campaigners for abolition were partially rewarded with the Homicide Act 1957. The Act brought in a distinction between capital and non-capital murder. Only six categories of murder were now punishable by execution:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe police and the government were of the opinion that the death penalty deterred offenders from carrying firearms and it was for this reason that such offences remained punishable by death.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965 the Labour MP Sydney Silverman, who had committed himself to the cause of abolition for longer than 20 years, introduced a Private Member's Bill to suspend the death penalty for murder. It was passed on a free vote in the House of Commons by 200 votes to 98. The bill was subsequently passed by the House of Lords by 204 votes to 104.[14][15] Silverman was opposed in the General Election 1966 in the Nelson and Colne constituency by Patrick Downey, the uncle of Lesley Anne Downey, a victim in the Moors murders case, who stood on an explicitly pro-hanging platform. Downey polled over 5,000 votes, 13.7%, then the largest vote for a genuinely independent candidate since 1945.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 suspended the death penalty in Great Britain (but not in Northern Ireland) for murder for a period of five years, and substituted a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment; it further provided that if, before the expiry of the five-year suspension, each House of Parliament passed a resolution to make the effect of the Act permanent, then it would become permanent. In 1969 the Home Secretary, James Callaghan, proposed a motion to make the Act permanent, which was carried in the Commons on 16 December 1969,[17] and a similar motion was carried in the Lords on 18 December.[18] The death penalty for murder was abolished in Northern Ireland on 25 July 1973 under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the abolition of the death penalty for murder, the House of Commons held a vote during each subsequent parliament until 1997 to restore the death penalty. This motion was always defeated, but the death penalty remained for other crimes until the dates mentioned below:\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, no executions were carried out in the United Kingdom for any of these offences after the abolition of the death penalty for murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, there remained a working gallows at HMP Wandsworth, London, until 1994, which was tested every six months until 1992. This gallows is now housed in the Galleries of Justice in Nottingham.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nEngland and in the United Kingdom: on 13 August 1964, Peter Anthony Allen, at Walton Prison in Liverpool, and Gwynne Owen Evans, at Strangeways Prison in Manchester, were executed for the murder of John Alan West on 7 April that year.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nScotland: Henry John Burnett, 21, on 15 August 1963 in Craiginches Prison, Aberdeen, for the murder of seaman Thomas Guyan.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorthern Ireland: Robert McGladdery, 26, on 20 December 1961 in Crumlin Road Gaol, Belfast, for the murder of Pearl Gamble.\\r\\n\\r\\nWales: Vivian Teed, 24, in Swansea on 6 May 1958, for the murder of William Williams, sub-postmaster of Fforestfach Post Office.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorthern Ireland and the United Kingdom: Liam Holden in 1973 in Northern Ireland, for the capital murder of a British soldier during the Troubles.

He had shot his wife's lover in Cardiff.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Criminal Damage Act 1971 abolished the offence of arson in royal dockyards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Naval Discipline Act 1957 reduced the scope of capital espionage from \\"all spies for the enemy\\" to spies on naval ships or bases.[26] Later, the Armed Forces Act 1981 abolished the death penalty for espionage.[27] (The Official Secrets Act 1911 had created another offence of espionage which carried a maximum sentence of fourteen years.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBeheading was abolished as a method of execution for treason in 1973.[28] Hanging, however, remained available until 1998 when, under a House of Lords amendment to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, proposed by Lord Archer of Sandwell, the death penalty was abolished for treason and piracy with violence, replacing it with a discretionary maximum sentence of life imprisonment. These were the last civilian offences punishable by death.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 20 May 1998 the House of Commons voted to ratify the 6th Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights prohibiting capital punishment except \\"in time of war or imminent threat of war\\". The last remaining provisions for the death penalty under military jurisdiction (including in wartime) were removed when section 21(5) of the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force on 9 November 1998. On 10 October 2003, effective from 1 February 2004,[29] the UK acceded to the 13th Protocol, which prohibits the death penalty in all circumstances.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a legacy from colonial times, several states in the West Indies still had the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as the court of final appeal; although the death penalty has been retained in these states, the Privy Council would sometimes delay or deny executions. Some of these states severed links with the British court system in 2001 by transferring the responsibilities of the Privy Council to the Caribbean Court of Justice, to speed up executions.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough not part of the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey are British Crown dependencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Channel Islands, the last death sentence was passed in 1984; the last execution in the Channel Islands was in Jersey on 9 October 1959, when Francis Joseph Huchet was hanged for murder.[32] The Human Rights (Amendment) (Jersey) Order 2006[33] amends the Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000[34] to give effect to the 13th Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights providing for the total abolition of the death penalty. Both of these laws came into effect on 10 December 2006. Capital punishment was abolished in Guernsey in 2003, and the 13th Protocol was extended to Guernsey in April 2004. Sark formally retained it until January 2004, when the Chief Pleas in a 14ÿ9 vote removed it from the statutes.[35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last execution on the Isle of Man took place in 1872, when John Kewish was hanged for patricide. Capital punishment was not formally abolished by Tynwald (the island's parliament) until 1993.[37] Five persons were sentenced to death (for murder) on the Isle of Man between 1973 and 1992, although all sentences were commuted to life imprisonment. The last person to be sentenced to death in the UK or its dependencies was Anthony Teare, who was convicted at the Manx Court of General Gaol Delivery in Douglas for contract murder in 1992; he was subsequently retried and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1994.[38] In 2004 the 13th Protocol was adopted,[39] with an effective date of 1 November 2006.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the Crown dependencies, the British overseas territories are constitutionally not part of the United Kingdom. However, the British government's ultimate responsibility for good governance of the territories has led it over recent years to pursue a policy of revoking all statutory provision for the death penalty in those territories where it had up until recently been legal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last executions in an overseas territory, and indeed the last on British soil, took place in Bermuda in 1977, when two men, Larry Tacklyn and Erskine Burrows, were hanged for the 1973 murder of the territory's then Governor Sir Richard Sharples.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991, the British government extended an Order in Council to its Caribbean territories whose effect was to abolish capital punishment for murder: Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat and the Turks and Caicos Islands.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British government was unable to extend the abolition via Order in Council to Bermuda, the UK's most autonomous overseas territory with powers of almost total self-governancebut warned that if voluntary abolition was not forthcoming it would be forced to consider the unprecedented step of \\"whether to impose abolition by means of an Act of Parliament\\".[43] As a result, the Bermudian government introduced its own domestic legislation in 1999 to rectify the problem.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther measures were subsequently adopted to revoke technicalities in British overseas territories' domestic legislation as regards use of the death penalty for crimes of treason and piracy. In October 2002 the British government abolished the death penalty for treason and piracy in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Since then, the death penalty has been outlawed under all circumstances in all the UK's overseas territories.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the death penalty's suspension in 1965, there have been continued public and media calls for its reintroduction, particularly prompted by high-profile murder cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, there have been a number of miscarriages of justice since 1965 where someone convicted of murder has later had their conviction quashed on appeal and been released from prison, strengthening the argument of those who oppose the death penalty's reintroduction. These include the Birmingham Six (cleared in 1991 of planting an IRA bomb which killed 21 people in 1974), the Guildford Four (cleared in 1989 of murdering five people in another 1974 IRA bombing), Stephen Downing (a Derbyshire man who was freed in 2001 after serving 27 years for the murder of a woman in a churchyard) and Barry George (who was freed in 2007 when his conviction for the 1999 murder of TV presenter Jill Dando was quashed on appeal).[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the first high-profile murder case which sparked widespread calls for a return of the death penalty was the Moors murders trial in 1966, the year after the death penalty's suspension, in which Ian Brady and Myra Hindley were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murders of two children and a teenager in the Manchester area (they later confessed to a further two murders).[47] Later in 1966, the murder of three policemen in West London also attracted widespread public support for the death penalty's return.[48] Other subsequent high-profile cases to have sparked widespread media and public calls for the death penalty's return include \\"Yorkshire Ripper\\" Peter Sutcliffe, convicted in 1981 of murdering 13 women and attacking seven others in the north of England,[49] Roy Whiting, who murdered a seven-year-old girl in West Sussex in 2000,[50] and Ian Huntley, a Cambridgeshire school caretaker who killed two 10-year-old girls in 2002.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nA November 2009 television survey showed that 70% favoured reinstating the death penalty for at least one of the following crimes: armed robbery, rape, crimes related to paedophilia, terrorism, adult murder, child murder, child rape, treason, child abuse or kidnapping. However, respondents only favoured capital punishment for adult murder, the polling question asked by other organisations such as Gallup, by small majorities or pluralities: overall, 51% favoured the death penalty for adult murder, while 56% in Wales did, 55% in Scotland, and only 49% in England.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2011, the Internet blogger Paul Staineswho writes a political blog as Guido Fawkes and heads the Restore Justice Campaignlaunched an e-petition on the Downing Street website calling for the restoration of the death penalty for those convicted of the murder of children and police officers.[53] The petition was one of several in support or opposition of capital punishment to be published by the government with the launch of its e-petitions website. Petitions attracting 100,000 signatures would prompt a parliamentary debate on a particular topic, but not necessarily lead to any Parliamentary Bills being put forward.[54] When the petition closed on 4 February 2012 it had received 26,351 signatures in support of restoring capital punishment,[55] but a counter-petition calling to retain the ban on capital punishment received 33,455 signatures during the same time period.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso in August 2011, a representative survey conducted by Angus Reid Public Opinion showed that 65% of Britons support reinstating the death penalty for murder in Great Britain, while 28% oppose this course of action. Men and respondents aged over 35 are more likely to endorse the change.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2015 a survey by the NatCen British Social Attitudes Report showed that public support for the death penalty had dropped to 48 per cent.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Royal Assent for the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965, supporters in Parliament have made several attempts to reintroduce capital punishment. On 23 November 1966, Duncan Sandys was refused leave to bring in a Bill to restore capital punishment for the murder of police or prison officers, by a vote of 170 to 292.[59] Motions to make the five-year suspension of capital punishment under the 1965 Act permanent were opposed, but agreed by 343 to 185 in the House of Commons;[60] in the House of Lords, an amendment to continue with a temporary suspension of capital punishment until 31 July 1973 was rejected by 174 to 220.[61] In April 1973, the House of Commons voted against reintroduction.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deaths of civilians in several IRA bombings in 1974 prompted a renewed debate. On 11 December 1974 Brian Walden moved a motion declaring that \\"the death penalty would neither deter terrorists nor increase the safety of the public\\"; Jill Knight moved an amendment calling instead for introduction of legislation providing for death to be the penalty for acts of terrorism causing death. Her amendment was rejected by 217 to 369.[63] A year later, Ivan Lawrence's motion \\"That this House demands capital punishment for terrorist offences causing death\\" was rejected by 232 to 361.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Conservatives' victory in the 1979 general election, Eldon Griffiths (Parliamentary adviser to the Police Federation of England and Wales) moved a motion \\"that the sentence of capital punishment should again be available to the courts\\" on 19 July 1979.[65] While the motion was not expected to pass, the margin of its defeat (243 to 362) was much wider than expected.[66] Later in the same Parliament, the Criminal Justice Bill provided an opportunity on 11 May 1982 for several new clauses to be proposed which would have reinstated capital punishment. The first, which simply declared that \\"A person convicted of murder shall be liable to capital punishment\\", was tabled by Edward Gardner, and rejected by 195 to 357.[67] It was followed by an alternative under which capital punishment would be available \\"as the penalty for an act of terrorism involving the loss of human life\\"; this new clause was rejected by 176 to 332.[68] A further new clause proposing capital punishment \\"as the penalty for murder by means of firearms or explosives\\" was rejected by 176 to 343.[69] Then a new clause allowing for capital punishment \\"as the penalty for murder of a police or prison officer\\" was rejected by 208 to 332.[70] Finally a new clause allowing capital punishment \\"as the penalty for murder in the course of robbery and burglary which involves the use of offensive weapons\\" was rejected by 151 to 331.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new Parliament in 1983 again prompted supporters of capital punishment to put their case. Sir Edward Gardner's motion \\"That this House favours the restoration of the death penalty for murder\\" was debated on 13 July 1983, with several amendments moved to restrict capital punishment to certain categories of murder. The amendments were voted on first: capital punishment for murder \\"resulting from acts of terrorism\\" was rejected by 245 to 361, for murder \\"of a police officer during the course of his duties\\" by 263 to 344, for murder \\"of a prison officer during the course of his duties\\" by 252 to 348, for murder \\"by shooting or causing an explosion\\" by 204 to 374, and for murder \\"in the course or furtherance of theft\\" by 194 to 369. The main motion was then defeated by 223 to 368.[72] Towards the end of the Parliament, a new clause proposed to the Criminal Justice Bill proposed to return the death penalty for \\"A person convicted by the unanimous verdict of a jury of the premeditated killing of another person or of knowingly and intentionally killing another person in a manner, or for a reason, or in circumstances which a reasonable person would consider to be evil\\" was rejected by 230 to 342 on 1 April 1987.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Criminal Justice Bill in 1988 provided a further opportunity for a debate; the new clause proposed by Roger Gale allowed for the jury in a murder case to \\"have the power, upon reaching a verdict of guilt of murder, to recommend ... death in the manner authorised by law\\". It was rejected by 218 to 341.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aforementioned bills were rejected despite support from then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 December 1990 a new Criminal Justice Bill again saw amendments designed to reintroduce capital punishment. The first covered anyone over 18 \\"convicted of the murder of a police officer acting in the execution of his duty\\" and was rejected by 215 to 350;[76] a general reintroduction of death as the penalty for murder (with special provision for the Court of Appeal to decide whether to substitute a life sentence) was then rejected by 182 to 367.[77] Capital punishment for \\"murder committed by means of firearms, explosives or an offensive weapon, or for the murder of a police or prison officer\\" was rejected by 186 to 349.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most recent Parliamentary debate on a question proposing reintroduction of capital punishment came on 21 February 1994 when new clauses to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill were moved. The first, providing for death as the sentence for \\"the murder of a police officer acting in the execution of his duty\\", was rejected by 186 to 383;[79] A new clause providing for general reintroduction with power for the Court of Appeal to substitute life imprisonment was rejected by 159 to 403.[80] This would have been aimed at terrorists in the Northern Ireland conflict.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2013 a new bill for capital punishment in England and Wales was introduced. This Bill has been withdrawn and will not progress any further.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following parties support the reintroduction of capital punishment:","input":"When was capital punishment introduced in the uk?"},{"output":"John Roberts","context":" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Justice of the United States is the chief judge of the Supreme Court of the United States and thus the head of the United States federal court system, which functions as the judicial branch of the nation's federal government. The Chief Justice is one of nine Supreme Court justices; the other eight have the title Associate Justice.\\r\\nThe Chief Justice, as the highest judicial officer in the country, serves as a spokesperson for the federal government's judicial branch, and acts as a chief administrative officer for the federal courts. The Chief Justice is also head of the Judicial Conference of the United States, and in that capacity appoints the director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. By law, the Chief Justice is also a member of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, and by custom is elected chancellor of the board.\\r\\nThe Chief Justice leads the business of the Supreme Court and presides over oral arguments. When the court renders an opinion, the Chief Justicewhen in the majoritydecides who writes the court's opinion. The Chief Justice also has significant agenda-setting power over the court's meetings. In the case of an impeachment of a President of the United States, which has occurred twice, the Chief Justice presides over the trial in the U.S. Senate. Additionally, the presidential oath of office is typically administered by the Chief Justice (although the Constitution does not assign this duty to anyone in particular).\\r\\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 17 persons have served as chief justice. The first was John Jay (1789ÿ1795). The current chief justice is John Roberts (since 2005). FourEdward Douglass White, Charles Evans Hughes, Harlan Fiske Stone, and William Rehnquistwere previously confirmed for associate justice and subsequently confirmed for chief justice separately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Constitution does not explicitly establish an office of Chief Justice, but presupposes its existence with a single reference in Article I, Section 3, Clause 6: \\"When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.\\" Nothing more is said in the Constitution regarding the office. Article III, Section 1, which authorizes the establishment of the Supreme Court, refers to all members of the Court simply as \\"judges.\\" The Judiciary Act of 1789 created the distinctive titles of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\\r\\nIn 1866, at the urging of Salmon P. Chase, Congress restyled the chief justice's title to the current Chief Justice of the United States. The first person whose Supreme Court commission contained the modified title was Melville Fuller in 1888.[1] The associate justices' title was not altered in 1866, and remains as originally created.\\r\\nThe chief justice, like all federal judges, is nominated by the President and confirmed to office by the U.S. Senate. Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution specifies that they \\"shall hold their Offices during good Behavior\\". This language means that the appointments are effectively for life, and that, once in office, a justice's tenure ends only when they die, retire, resign, or are removed from office through the impeachment process.\\r\\nThe salary of the chief justice is set by Congress; the current (2018) annual salary is $267,000, which is slightly higher than that of associate justices, which is $255,300.[2] The practice of appointing an individual to serve as chief justice is grounded in tradition; while the Constitution mandates that there be a chief justice, it is silent on the subject of how one is chosen and by whom. There is no specific constitutional prohibition against using another method to select the chief justice from among those justices properly appointed and confirmed to the Supreme Court. Constitutional law scholar Todd Pettys has proposed that presidential appointment of chief justices should be done away with, and replaced by a process that permits the Justices to select their own chief justice.[3]\\r\\nThree incumbent associate justices have been nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate as chief justice: Edward Douglass White in 1910, Harlan Fiske Stone in 1941, and William Rehnquist in 1986. A fourth, Abe Fortas, was nominated to the position in 1968, but not confirmed. As an associate justice does not have to resign his or her seat on the Court in order to be nominated as chief justice, Fortas remained an associate justice. Similarly, when associate justice William Cushing was nominated and confirmed as chief justice in January 1796, but declined the office, he too remained on the Court. Additionally, two former associate justices subsequently returned to service on the Court as chief justice. John Rutledge was the first. President Washington gave him a recess appointment in 1795. However, his subsequent nomination to the office was not confirmed by the Senate, and he left office and the Court. In 1933, former associate justice Charles Evans Hughes was confirmed as chief justice.\\r\\nAlong with his general responsibilities as a member of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice has several unique duties to fulfill.\\r\\nArticle I, section 3 of the U.S. Constitution stipulates that the Chief Justice shall preside over impeachment trials of the President of the United States in the U.S. Senate. Two Chief Justices, Salmon P. Chase and William Rehnquist, have presided over the trial in the Senate that follows an impeachment of the president ÿ Chase in 1868 over the proceedings against President Andrew Johnson and Rehnquist in 1999 over the proceedings against President Bill Clinton. Both presidents were subsequently acquitted.\\r\\nMany of the procedures and inner workings of the Court turn on the seniority of the justices. Traditionally, the chief justice has been regarded as primus inter pares (first among equals)that is, the chief justice is the highest-ranking and foremost member of the Court, regardless of that officeholder's length of service when compared against that of any associate justice. This seniority and added prestige enables a chief justice to define the Court's culture and norms, and thus influence how it functions. The chief justice sets the agenda for the weekly meetings where the justices review the petitions for certiorari, to decide whether to hear or deny each case. The Supreme Court agrees to hear less than one percent of the cases petitioned to it. While associate justices may append items to the weekly agenda, in practice this initial agenda-setting power of the chief justice has significant influence over the direction of the court. Nonetheless, a chief justice's influence may be limited by circumstances and the associate justices' understanding of legal principles; it is definitely limited by the fact that he has only a single vote of nine on the decision whether to grant or deny certiorari.[4][5]\\r\\nDespite the chief justice's elevated stature, his vote carries the same legal weight as the vote of each associate justice. Additionally, he has no legal authority to overrule the verdicts or interpretations of the other eight judges or tamper with them.[4] The task of assigning who shall write the opinion for the majority falls to the most senior justice in the majority. Thus, when the chief justice is in the majority, he always assigns the opinion.[6] Early in his tenure, Chief Justice John Marshall insisted upon holdings which the justices could unanimously back as a means to establish and build the Court's national prestige. In doing so, Marshall would often write the opinions himself, and actively discouraged dissenting opinions. Associate Justice William Johnson eventually persuaded Marshall and the rest of the Court to adopt its present practice: one justice writes an opinion for the majority, and the rest are free to write their own separate opinions or not, whether concurring or dissenting.[7]\\r\\nThe chief justice's formal prerogativewhen in the majorityto assign which justice will write the Court's opinion is perhaps his most influential power,[5] as this enables him to influence the historical record.[4] He \\"may assign this task to the individual justice best able to hold together a fragile coalition, to an ideologically amenable colleague, or to himself.\\" Opinion authors can have a big influence on the content of an opinion; two justices in the same majority, given the opportunity, might write very different majority opinions.[5] A chief justice who knows well the associate justices can therefore do muchby the simple act of selecting the justice who writes the opinion of the courtto affect the general character or tone of an opinion, which in turn can affect the interpretation of that opinion in cases before lower courts in the years to come.\\r\\nAdditionally, the chief justice chairs the conferences where cases are discussed and tentatively voted on by the justices. He normally speaks first and so has influence in framing the discussion. Although the chief justice votes firstthe Court votes in order of seniorityhe may strategically pass in order to ensure membership in the majority if desired.[5] It is reported that:\\r\\nChief Justice Warren Burger was renowned, and even vilified in some quarters, for voting strategically during conference discussions on the Supreme Court in order to control the Courts agenda through opinion assignment. Indeed, Burger is said to have often changed votes to join the majority coalition, cast \\"phony votes\\" by voting against his preferred position, and, declined to express a position at conference.[8]\\r\\nThe Chief Justice typically administers the oath of office at the inauguration of the President of the United States. This is a tradition, rather than a constitutional responsibility of the Chief Justice; the Constitution does not require that the oath be administered by anyone in particular, simply that it be taken by the president. Law empowers any federal and state judge, as well as notaries public (such as John Calvin Coolidge, Sr.), to administer oaths and affirmations.\\r\\nIf the Chief Justice is ill or incapacitated, the oath is usually administered by the next senior member of the Supreme Court. Seven times, someone other than the Chief Justice of the United States administered the oath of office to the President.[9] Robert Livingston, as Chancellor of the State of New York (the state's highest ranking judicial office), administered the oath of office to George Washington at his first inauguration; there was no Chief Justice of the United States, nor any other federal judge prior to their appointments by President Washington in the months following his inauguration. William Cushing, an associate justice of the Supreme Court, administered Washington's second oath of office in 1793. Calvin Coolidge's father, a notary public, administered the oath to his son after the death of Warren Harding.[10] This, however, was contested upon Coolidge's return to Washington and his oath was re-administered by Judge Adolph A. Hoehling, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.[11] John Tyler and Millard Fillmore were both sworn in on the death of their predecessors by Chief Justice William Cranch of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia.[12] Chester A. Arthur and Theodore Roosevelt's initial oaths reflected the unexpected nature of their taking office. On November 22, 1963, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Judge Sarah T. Hughes, a federal district court judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, administered the oath of office to then Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson aboard the presidential airplane.\\r\\nIn addition, the Chief Justice ordinarily administers the oath of office to newly appointed and confirmed associate justices, whereas the senior associate justice will normally swear in a new Chief Justice or vice president.\\r\\nSince the tenure of William Howard Taft, the office of the Chief Justice has moved beyond just first among equals.[13] The Chief Justice also:\\r\\nUnlike Senators and Representatives who are constitutionally prohibited from holding any other \\"office of trust or profit\\" of the United States or of any state while holding their congressional seats, the Chief Justice and the other members of the federal judiciary are not barred from serving in other positions. Chief Justice John Jay served as a diplomat to negotiate the so-called Jay Treaty (also known as the Treaty of London of 1794), Justice Robert H. Jackson was appointed by President Truman to be the U.S. Prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials of leading Nazis, and Chief Justice Earl Warren chaired The President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. As described above, the Chief Justice holds office in the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress.\\r\\nUnder 28 USC,[15] when the Chief Justice is unable to discharge his functions, or that office is vacant, his duties are carried out by the most senior associate justice who is able to act, until the disability or vacancy ends, as chief justice.[3] As of February 13, 2016, Anthony Kennedy is the most senior associate justice.\\r\\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, the following 17 persons have served as Chief Justice:[16][17]","input":"Who is the current us supreme court chief justice?"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},B={class:"card-container"};function x(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):y("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(M,[["render",x]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/18.md","filePath":"qapage/18.md"}'),H={name:"qapage/18.md"},R=Object.assign(H,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{W as __pageData,R as default};
