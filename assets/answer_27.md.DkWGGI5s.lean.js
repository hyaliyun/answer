Fatty acids are a family of molecules classified within the lipid macronutrient class . One role of fatty acids in animal metabolism is energy production , captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . When compared to other macronutrient classes ( carbohydrates and protein ) , fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis , when they are completely oxidized to CO and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle . Fatty acids ( mainly in the form of triglycerides ) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals , and to a lesser extent in plants . In addition , fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed ( the cell wall , and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells , such as the nucleus , the mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , and the Golgi apparatus ) . Fatty acids can also be cleaved , or partially cleaved , from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell , and local hormones in the immediate vicinity of the cell . The prostaglandins made from arachidonic acid stored in the cell membrane , are probably the most well known group of these local hormones ."},{"query":"what a piece of work is man picard","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` What a piece of work is man !

Water is necessary for plants but only a small amount of water taken up by the roots is used for growth and metabolism . The remaining 97 -- 99.5 % is lost by transpiration and guttation . Leaf surfaces are dotted with pores called stomata , and in most plants they are more numerous on the undersides of the foliage . The stomata are bordered by guard cells and their stomatal accessory cells ( together known as stomatal complex ) that open and close the pore . Transpiration occurs through the stomatal apertures , and can be thought of as a necessary \`\` cost '' associated with the opening of the stomata to allow the diffusion of carbon dioxide gas from the air for photosynthesis . Transpiration also cools plants , changes osmotic pressure of cells , and enables mass flow of mineral nutrients and water from roots to shoots . Two major factors influence the rate of water flow from the soil to the roots : the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the magnitude of the pressure gradient through the soil . Both of these factors influence the rate of bulk flow of water moving from the roots to the stomatal pores in the leaves via the xylem ."},{"query":"names of the darling family in peter pan","short_answer":"Wendy Moira Angela Darling|John Napoleon Darling|Michael Nicholas Darling|George Darling|Mary Darling|Jane|Margaret","abstract":"The works of J.M.

This increase in membrane potential is what causes the cell membrane , which typically maintains a resting membrane potential of - 70 mV , to reach the threshold potential and consequently fire the next action potential ; thus , the pacemaker potential is what drives the self - generated rhythmic firing ( automaticity ) of pacemaker cells , and the rate of change ( i.e. , the slope ) of the pacemaker potential is what determines the timing of the next action potential and thus the intrinsic firing rate of the cell . In a healthy sinoatrial node ( SAN , a complex tissue within the right atrium containing pacemaker cells that normally determine the intrinsic firing rate for the entire heart ) , the pacemaker potential is the main determinant of the heart rate . Because the pacemaker potential represents the non-contracting time between heart beats ( diastole ) , it is also called the diastolic depolarization . The amount of net inward current required to move the cell membrane potential during the pacemaker phase is extremely small , in the order of few pAs , but this net flux arises from time to time changing contribution of several currents that flow with different voltage and time dependence . Evidence in support of the active presence of K , Ca , Na channels and Na / K exchanger during the pacemaker phase have been variously reported in the literature , but several indications point to the \`\` funny '' ( I ) current as one of the most important. ( see funny current ) . There is now substantial evidence that also sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) Ca - transients participate to the generation of the diastolic depolarization via a process involving the Na -- Ca exchanger ."},{"query":"where will the next general conference of sda be held","short_answer":"Indianapolis , Indiana","abstract":"The General Conference Session is the official world meeting of the General Conference of Seventh - day Adventists , held every five years .

The U.S. involvement in South Vietnam stemmed from 20 long years of political and economic action . These had the common incentive of ending the growing communist domination in Vietnam . At the time , French forces , allies of the U.S. , were backed by America -- President Harry S. Truman provided progressively increasing amounts of financial and military assistance to French forces fighting in Vietnam . From the spring of 1950 , their involvement increased from just assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states ( Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia ) . Eventually , U.S. missions were carried out at a more constant rate by sending out increasing number of military assistance from the United States . Their main intent was to restrict the Communist domination that was present in the government of Vietnam as it would soon lead to a chain of neighbouring countries adopting the same . This would have resulted in a change in balance of power throughout Southeast Asia . The U.S. foreign policy establishment saw national security interests being disturbed due to the rise of this communist expansion and strived to take any measure to end it .

The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the body , then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond to such events . Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago . In vertebrates it consists of two main parts , the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord . The PNS consists mainly of nerves , which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons , that connect the CNS to every other part of the body . Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves , while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent . Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves . The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems , the somatic , autonomic , and enteric nervous systems . Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement . The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy , while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state . The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system . Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily . Nerves that exit from the cranium are called cranial nerves while those exiting from the spinal cord are called spinal nerves ."},{"query":"who wrote you'll never know how much i love you","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` You 'll Never Know '' is a popular song with music written by Harry Warren and the lyrics by Mack Gordon .

For example , for a proposed society in which 50 % of the population is kept in slavery , it follows that on entering the new society there is a 50 % likelihood that the participant would be a slave .

The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen , called an antigen , via the Fab 's variable region . Each tip of the \`\` Y '' of an antibody contains a paratope ( analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( similarly analogous to a key ) on an antigen , allowing these two structures to bind together with precision . Using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival ) . Depending on the antigen , the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activate macrophages to destroy the foreign substance . The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its Fc region ( located at the base of the \`\` Y '' ) , which contains a conserved glycosylation site involved in these interactions . The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system ."},{"query":"when was the first meeting of constitution assembly held","short_answer":"6 December 1946","abstract":"An idea for a Constituent Assembly of India was proposed in 1934 by M.N.

Prison building efforts in the United States came in three major waves . The first began during the Jacksonian Era and led to widespread use of imprisonment and rehabilitative labor as the primary penalty for most crimes in nearly all states by the time of the American Civil War . The second began after the Civil War and gained momentum during the Progressive Era , bringing a number of new mechanisms -- such as parole , probation , and indeterminate sentencing -- into the mainstream of American penal practice . Finally , since the early 1970s , the United States has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of its imprisonment systems at both the federal and state level . Since 1973 , the number of incarcerated persons in the United States has increased five-fold , and in a given year 7,000,000 people were under the supervision or control of correctional services in the United States .

At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action . The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era . Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country ; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea . Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system . Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support . South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union . The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea 's request for weapons and troops .

Small boats are typically found on inland waterways ( e.g. rivers and lakes ) or in protected coastal areas . However , boats such as the whaleboat were designed for operation as a ship in an offshore environment .

An older tradition is that a ship has a weather deck fully enclosing the hull space , while a boat lacks a full weather deck ; this is suggested as the reason why submarines are referred to as ' boats ' rather than ' ships ' , as a cylindrical hull has interior decks but no weatherdeck . Another definition is a vessel that can be lifted out of the water .

The complementary nature of this based - paired structure provides a backup copy of all genetic information encoded within double - stranded DNA . The regular structure and data redundancy provided by the DNA double helix make DNA well suited to the storage of genetic information , while base - pairing between DNA and incoming nucleotides provides the mechanism through which DNA polymerase replicates DNA , and RNA polymerase transcribes DNA into RNA .
