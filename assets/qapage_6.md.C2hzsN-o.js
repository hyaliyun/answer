It stars Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow and Gunnar Hansen, who respectively portray Sally Hardesty, Franklin Hardesty, the hitchhiker, the proprietor, and Leatherface. The film follows a group of friends who fall victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead. Although it was marketed as a true story to attract a wider audience and as a subtle commentary on the era's political climate, its plot is entirely fictional; however, the character of Leatherface and minor plot details were inspired by the crimes of real-life murderer Ed Gein.\\r\\nHooper produced the film for less than $300,000 and used a cast of relatively unknown actors drawn mainly from central Texas, where the film was shot. The limited budget forced Hooper to film for long hours seven days a week, so that he could finish as quickly as possible and reduce equipment rental costs. Due to the film's violent content, Hooper struggled to find a distributor. Louis Perano of Bryanston Pictures eventually purchased the distribution rights. Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG rating, but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated it R. The film faced similar difficulties internationally.\\r\\nUpon its October 1974 release, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was banned outright in several countries, and numerous theaters later stopped showing the film in response to complaints about its violence. While it initially drew a mixed reception from critics, it was enormously profitable, grossing over $30 million at the domestic box office. It has since received a positive reappraisal and gained a reputation as one of the best and most influential horror films in cinema history. It is credited with originating several elements common in the slasher genre, including the use of power tools as murder weapons and the characterization of the killer as a large, hulking, faceless figure. The popularity of the film led to a franchise that continued the story of Leatherface and his family through sequels, remakes, one prequel, comic books and video games.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) and her paraplegic brother, Franklin (Paul A. Partain), travel with three friends, Jerry (Allen Danziger), Kirk (William Vail), and Pam (Teri McMinn), to visit the grave of the Hardestys' grandfather to investigate reports of vandalism and grave robbing. Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) who talks about his family who worked at the old slaughterhouse. He borrows Franklin's pocket-knife and cuts himself, then takes a Polaroid picture of the others and demands money for it. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo and slashes Franklin's arm with a straight razor. The group forces him out of the van and drive on. They stop at a gas station to refuel, but the proprietor (Jim Siedow) tells them that the pumps are empty.\\r\\nThey continue toward the homestead, intending to return to the gas station once it has received a fuel delivery. When they arrive, Franklin tells Kirk and Pam about a local swimming-hole and the couple head off to find it. They find the swimming-hole dried up but hear a generator running in the distance. They stumble upon a nearby house. Kirk calls out, asking for gas, while Pam waits on a swing in the yard. After Kirk receives no answer, he enters through the unlocked door, whereupon Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) appears and kills him with a hammer. Pam enters soon after and trips into a room filled with furniture made from human bones. She attempts to flee, but Leatherface catches her and impales her on a meathook, making her watch as he butchers Kirk with a chainsaw. Jerry heads out to look for Pam and Kirk at sunset. He finds the couple's blanket outside the nearby house. He investigates and finds Pam, still alive, inside a freezer. Before he can react, Leatherface kills him and stuffs Pam back into the freezer.\\r\\nWith darkness falling, Sally and Franklin set out to find their friends. As they near the neighboring house and call out, Leatherface lunges from the darkness and kills Franklin with a chainsaw. Sally runs toward the house and finds the desiccated remains of an elderly couple in an upstairs room. She escapes from Leatherface by jumping through a second-floor window and flees to the gas station. Leatherface disappears into the night. The proprietor calms her with offers of help but then ties her up, gags her and forces her into his truck. He drives to the house, arriving at the same time as the hitchhiker, now revealed as Leatherface's brother. When the pair bring Sally inside, the hitchhiker recognizes her and taunts her.\\r\\nThe men torment the bound and gagged Sally while Leatherface, now dressed as a woman, serves dinner. Leatherface and the hitchhiker bring Grandpa (John Dugan), one of the desiccated bodies seen earlier, down from upstairs. He is revealed to be alive when he sucks blood from a cut in Sally's finger. During the night, they decide that Grandpa, the best killer in the old slaughterhouse, should kill Sally. He tries to hit her with a hammer but is too weak. In the ensuing confusion, she breaks free, leaps through a window, and flees to the road. Leatherface and the hitchhiker give chase, but the latter is run over and killed by a passing semi-trailer truck. Armed with his chainsaw, Leatherface attacks the truck when the driver stops to help; the driver knocks down Leatherface with a pipe wrench, causing the chainsaw to cut his leg. The driver flees, and Sally escapes in the back of a passing pickup truck as Leatherface dances maniacally in the road with his chainsaw.\\r\\nThe concept for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre arose in the early 1970s while Tobe Hooper was working as an assistant film director at the University of Texas at Austin and as a documentary cameraman.[3] He had already developed a story involving the elements of isolation, the woods, and darkness.[4] He credited the graphic coverage of violence by San Antonio news outlets as one inspiration for the film[5] and based elements of the plot on serial killer Ed Gein in 1950s Wisconsin;[6] Gein inspired other horror films such as Psycho (1960) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991).[7][8][9][10] During development, Hooper used the working titles of Headcheese and Leatherface.[11][12]\\r\\nHooper has cited changes in the cultural and political landscape as central influences on the film. His intentional misinformation, that the \\"film you are about to see is true\\", was a response to being \\"lied to by the government about things that were going on all over the world\\", including Watergate, the 1973 oil crisis, and \\"the massacres and atrocities in the Vietnam War\\".[5] The \\"lack of sentimentality and the brutality of things\\" that Hooper noticed while watching the local news, whose graphic coverage was epitomized by \\"showing brains spilled all over the road\\", led to his belief that \\"man was the real monster here, just wearing a different face, so I put a literal mask on the monster in my film\\".[8] The idea of using a chainsaw as the murder weapon came to Hooper while he was in the hardware section of a busy store, contemplating how to speed his way through the crowd.[9]\\r\\nHooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the screenplay and formed Vortex, Inc.[15] with Henkel as president and Hooper as vice president.[16] They asked Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits.[17] Production manager Ron Bozman told most of the cast and crew that he would have to defer part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. Vortex made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share of its potential profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar to mortgage points. The cast and crew were not informed that Vortex owned only 50%, which meant their points were worth half of the assumed value.[16][18]\\r\\nMany of the cast members at the time were relatively unknown actorsTexans who had played roles in commercials, television, and stage shows, as well as performers whom Hooper knew personally, such as Allen Danziger and Jim Siedow.[19][20][21] Involvement in the film propelled some of them into the motion picture industry. The lead role of Sally was given to Marilyn Burns, who had appeared previously on stage and served on the film commission board at UT Austin while studying there.[20] Teri McMinn was a student who worked with local theater companies, including the Dallas Theater Center.[20] Henkel called McMinn to come in for a reading after he spotted her picture in the Austin American-Statesman.[22] For her last call-back he requested that she wear short shorts, which proved to be the most comfortable of all the cast members' costumes.[20]\\r\\nIcelandic-American actor Gunnar Hansen was selected for the role of Leatherface.[23] He regarded Leatherface as being mentally retarded and having never learned to speak properly. To research his character in preparation for his role, Hansen visited a special needs school and watched how the students moved and spoke.[9][24] John Larroquette performed the narration in the opening credits.[25]\\r\\nThe primary filming location was an early 1900s farmhouse located on Quick Hill Road near Round Rock, Texas, where the La Frontera development is now located.[26] The small budget and concerns over high-cost equipment rentals meant the crew filmed seven days a week, up to 16 hours a day. The environment was humid[18][27] and the cast and crew found conditions tough; temperatures peaked at 110F (43?C) on July 26.[28] Hansen later recalled, \\"It was 95, 100 degrees every day during filming. They wouldn't wash my costume because they were worried that the laundry might lose it, or that it would change color. They didn't have enough money for a second costume. So I wore that [mask] 12 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week, for a month.\\"[29]\\r\\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre was mainly shot using an Eclair NPR 16mm camera[11][30] with fine-grain, low-speed film that required four times more light than modern digital cameras.[31] Most of the filming took place in the farmhouse, which was filled with furniture constructed from animal bones and a latex material used as upholstery to give the appearance of human skin.[32] The house was not cooled, and there was little ventilation. The crew covered its walls with drops of animal blood obtained from a local slaughterhouse.[5] Art director Robert A. Burns drove around the countryside and collected the remains of cattle and other animals in various stages of decomposition, with which he littered the floors of the house.[32]\\r\\nThe special effects were simple and limited by the budget.[33] The on-screen blood was real in some cases,[34] such as the scene in which Leatherface feeds \\"Grandpa\\". The crew had difficulty getting the stage blood to come out of its tube, so instead Burns's index finger was cut with a razor.[35] Burns's costume was so drenched with stage blood that it was \\"virtually solid\\" by the last day of shooting.[20] The scene in which Leatherface decapitates Kirk with a chainsaw worried actor William Vail (Kirk). After telling Vail to stay still lest he really be killed, Hansen brought the running chainsaw to within 3 inches (8?cm) of Vail's face.[30] A real hammer was used for the climactic scene at the end, with some takes also featuring a mock-up. However, the actor playing Grandpa was aiming for the floor rather than his victim's head.[36] Still, the shoot was somewhat dangerous, with Hooper noting at the wrap party that all cast members had obtained some level of injury. He stated that \\"everyone hated me by the end of the production\\" and that \\"it just took years for them to kind of cool off.\\"[36][37]\\r\\nThe production exceeded its original $60,000 budget during editing.[38] Sources differ on the film's final cost, offering figures between $93,000 and $300,000.[23][39][40][41] A film production group, Pie in the Sky, provided $23,532 in exchange for 19% of Vortex.[42] This left Henkel, Hooper and the rest of the cast and crew with a 40.5% stake.[16] Warren Skaaren, then head of the Texas Film Commission, helped secure the distribution deal with Bryanston Pictures.[17] David Foster, producer of the 1982 horror film The Thing, arranged for a private screening for some of Bryanston Pictures' West Coast executives, and received 1.5% of Vortex's profits and a deferred fee of $500.[16]\\r\\nOn August 28, 1974, Louis Peraino of Bryanston agreed to distribute the film worldwide, from which Bozman and Skaaren would receive $225,000 and 35% of the profits. Years later Bozman stated, \\"We made a deal with the devil, [sigh], and I guess that, in a way, we got what we deserved.\\"[16] They signed the contract with Bryanston and, after the investors recouped their money (with interest),and after Skaaren, the lawyers, and the accountants were paidonly $8,100 was left to be divided among the 20 cast and crew members.[16] Eventually the producers sued Bryanston for failing to pay them their full percentage of the box office profits. A court judgment instructed Bryanston to pay the filmmakers $500,000, but by then the company had declared bankruptcy. In 1983 New Line Cinema acquired the distribution rights from Bryanston and gave the producers a larger share of the profits.[43]\\r\\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre premiered in Austin, Texas on October 1, 1974, almost a year after filming concluded. It screened nationally in the United States as a Saturday afternoon matine and its false marketing as a \\"true story\\" helped it attract a broad audience.[44][45] For eight years after 1976, it was annually reissued to first-run theaters, promoted by full-page ads.[46] The film eventually grossed more than $30 million in the United States and Canada[47] ($14.4 million in rentals), making it the 12th highest-grossing film initially released in 1974, despite its minuscule budget.[48] Among independent films, it was overtaken in 1978 by John Carpenter's Halloween, which grossed $47 million.[49]\\r\\nHooper reportedly hoped that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) would give the complete, uncut release print a \\"PG\\" rating due to its minimal amount of visible gore.[50][51][52] Instead, it was originally rated \\"X\\". After several minutes were cut, it was resubmitted to the MPAA and received an \\"R\\" rating. A distributor apparently restored the offending material, and at least one theater presented the full version under an \\"R\\".[53] In San Francisco, cinema-goers walked out of theaters in disgust[54] and, in February 1976, two theaters in Ottawa, Canada, were advised by local police to withdraw the film lest they face morality charges.[55]\\r\\nAfter its initial British release, including a one-year theatrical run in London,[56] The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was initially banned on the advice of British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) Secretary Stephen Murphy, and subsequently by his successor, James Ferman.[57][58] While the British ban was in force the word \\"chainsaw\\" itself was barred from movie titles, forcing imitators to rename their films.[59] In 1998, despite the BBFC ban, Camden London Borough Council granted the film a license.[60] The following year the BBFC passed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre for release with an 18 certificate (indicating that it should not be seen or purchased by a person under 18),[61] and it was broadcast a year later on Channel 4.[62][63]\\r\\nThe Australian censors refused to classify the 83-minute version of the film in June 1975;[64] the board similarly refused classification of a 77-minute print in December that year.[65] In 1981, an 83-minute version submitted by Greater Union Organization Film Distributors was again refused registration.[66] It was later submitted by Filmways Australia and approved for an \\"R\\" rating in 1984.[67][68] It was banned for periods in many other countries, including Brazil, Chile, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Singapore, Sweden and West Germany.[69][70][71]\\r\\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre received a mixed reaction upon its initial release. Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"despicable\\" and described Henkel and Hooper as more concerned with creating a realistic atmosphere than with its \\"plastic script\\".[72] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said it was \\"as violent and gruesome and blood-soaked as the title promises\\", yet praised its acting and technical execution.[73][74] Patrick Taggart of the Austin American-Statesman hailed it as the most important horror film since George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968).[75] Variety found the picture to be well-made, despite what it called the \\"heavy doses of gore\\".[76] John McCarty of Cinefantastique stated that the house featured in the film made the Bates motel \\"look positively pleasant by comparison\\".[77] Revisiting the film in his 1976 article \\"Fashions in Pornography\\" for Harper's Magazine, Stephen Koch found its sadistic violence to be extreme and unimaginative.[78]\\r\\nCritics later frequently praised both the film's aesthetic quality and its power. Observing that it managed to be \\"horrifying without being a bloodbath (you'll see more gore in a Steven Seagal film)\\", Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle called it \\"a backwoods masterpiece of fear and loathing\\".[79] TV Guide thought it was \\"intelligent\\" in its \\"bloodless depiction of violence\\",[80] while Anton Bitel felt the fact that it was banned in the United Kingdom was a tribute to its artistry. He pointed out how the quiet sense of foreboding at the beginning of the film grows, until the viewer experiences \\"a punishing assault on the senses\\".[81] In Hick Flicks: The Rise and Fall of Redneck Cinema, Scott Von Doviak commended its effective use of daylight shots, unusual among horror films, such as the sight of a corpse draped over a tombstone in the opening sequence.[82] Mike Emery of The Austin Chronicle praised the film's \\"subtle touches\\"such as radio broadcasts heard in the background describing grisly murders around Texasand said that what made it so dreadful was that it never strayed too far from potential reality.[83]\\r\\nIt has often been described as one of the scariest films of all time.[84] Rex Reed called it the most terrifying film he had ever seen.[85] Empire described it as \\"the most purely horrifying horror movie ever made\\" and called it \\"never less than totally committed to scaring you witless\\".[86] Reminiscing about his first viewing of the film, horror director Wes Craven recalled wondering \\"what kind of Mansonite crazoid\\" could have created such a thing.[87] It is a work of \\"cataclysmic terror\\", in the words of horror novelist Stephen King, who declared, \\"I would happily testify to its redeeming social merit in any court in the country.\\"[88] Critic Robin Wood found it one of the few horror films to possess \\"the authentic quality of nightmare\\".[89] Based on 56 reviews published since 2000, the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 88% of critics gave it a positive review, with an average score of 7.9 out of 10.[90]\\r\\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre is considered one of the greatestand most controversialof horror films,[91][92] and a major influence on the genre.[41][93] In 1999 Richard Zoglin of Time commented that it had \\"set a new standard for slasher films\\".[94] The Times listed it as one of the 50 most controversial films of all time.[95] Tony Magistrale believes the film paved the way for horror to be used as a vehicle for social commentary.[96] Describing it as \\"cheap, grubby and out of control\\", Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times declared that it \\"both defines and entirely supersedes the very notion of the exploitation picture\\".[97] In his book Dark Romance: Sexuality in the Horror Film, David Hogan called it \\"the most affecting gore thriller of all and, in a broader view, among the most effective horror films ever made ... the driving force of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is something far more horrible than aberrant sexuality: total insanity.\\"[98][99] According to Bill Nichols, it \\"achieves the force of authentic art, profoundly disturbing, intensely personal, yet at the same time far more than personal\\".[100] Leonard Wolf praised the film as \\"...an exquisite work of art\\" and compared it to a Greek tragedy, noting the lack of onscreen violence.[101]\\r\\nLeatherface has gained a reputation as a significant character in the horror genre,[102][103] responsible for establishing the use of conventional tools as murder weapons and the image of a large, silent killer devoid of personality.[104][105] Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com said, \\"In our collective consciousness, Leatherface and his chainsaw have become as iconic as Freddy and his razors or Jason and his hockey mask.\\"[106] Don Sumner called The Texas Chain Saw Massacre a classic that not only introduced a new villain to the horror pantheon but also influenced an entire generation of filmmakers.[107] According to Rebecca Ascher-Walsh of Entertainment Weekly, it laid the foundations for future horror franchises such as Halloween, The Evil Dead, and The Blair Witch Project.[108] Ridley Scott cited it as an inspiration for his 1979 film Alien.[109][110] French director Alexandre Aja credited it as an early influence on his career.[111] Horror filmmaker and heavy metal musician Rob Zombie sees it as a major influence on his art, most notably his 2003 film House of 1000 Corpses.[112]\\r\\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre was selected for the 1975 Cannes Film Festival Directors' Fortnight[56] and London Film Festival.[48] In 1976, it won the Special Jury Prize at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival in France.[113] Entertainment Weekly ranked the film sixth on its 2003 list of \\"The Top 50 Cult Films\\".[114] In a 2005 Total Film poll, it was selected as the greatest horror film of all time.[91][115] It was named among Time's top 25 horror films in 2007.[116] In 2008 the film ranked number 199 on Empire magazine's list of \\"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\\".[117] Empire also ranked it 46th in its list of the 50 greatest independent films.[118] In a 2010 Total Film poll, it was again selected as the greatest horror film; the judging panel included veteran horror directors such as John Carpenter, Wes Craven, and George A. Romero.[119] In 2010, as well, The Guardian ranked it number 14 on its list of the top 25 horror films.[120] The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was inducted into the Horror Hall of Fame in 1990, with director Hooper accepting the award,[121] and it is part of the permanent collection of New York City's Museum of Modern Art.[41] In 2012, the film was named by critics in the British Film Institute's Sight & Sound magazine as one of the 250 greatest films.[122]\\r\\nThe underlying themes of the film have been the subject of extensive critical discussion; critics and scholars have interpreted it as a paradigmatic exploitation film in which female protagonists are subjected to brutal, sadistic violence.[123][124] Stephen Prince comments that the horror is \\"born of the torment of the young woman subjected to imprisonment and abuse amid decaying arms... and mobiles made of human bones and teeth.\\"[125] As with many horror films, it focuses on the \\"final girl\\" tropethe heroine and inevitable lone survivor who somehow escapes the horror that befalls the other characters:[126][127] Sally Hardesty is wounded and tortured, yet manages to survive with the help of a male truck driver.[128] Critics argue that even in exploitation films in which the ratio of male and female deaths is roughly equal, the images that linger will be of the violence committed against the female characters.[126][129][130] The specific case of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre provides support for this argument: three men are killed in quick fashion, but one woman is brutally slaughteredhung on a meathookand the surviving woman endures physical and mental torture.[131] In 1977, critic Mary Mackey described the meathook scene as probably the most brutal onscreen female death in any commercially distributed film.[132] She placed it in a lineage of violent films that depict women as weak and incapable of protecting themselves.[132]\\r\\nIn one study, a group of men were shown five films depicting differing levels of violence against women.[133] On first viewing The Texas Chain Saw Massacre they experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety; however, upon subsequent viewing they found the violence against women less offensive and more enjoyable.[131] Another study, investigating gender-specific perceptions of slasher films, involved 30 male and 30 female university students.[134] One male participant described the screaming, especially Sally's, as the \\"most freaky thing\\" in the film.[134]\\r\\nAccording to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, the lack of explicit violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they play a central role in imagining.[135] Nonethelessciting its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts of light, and auditory pandemoniumStommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory rather than an intellectual level.[135]\\r\\nCritic Christopher Sharrett argues that since Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963), the American horror film has been defined by the questions it poses \\"about the fundamental validity of the American civilizing process\\",[137] concerns amplified during the 1970s by the \\"delegitimation of authority in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate\\".[138] \\"If Psycho began an exploration of a new sense of absurdity in contemporary life, of the collapse of causality and the diseased underbelly of American Gothic\\", he writes, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre \\"carries this exploration to a logical conclusion, addressing many of the issues of Hitchcock's film while refusing comforting closure\\".[139]\\r\\nRobin Wood characterizes Leatherface and his family as victims of industrial capitalism, their jobs as slaughterhouse workers having been rendered obsolete by technological advances.[140] He states that the picture \\"brings to focus a spirit of negativity... that seems to lie not far below the surface of the modern collective consciousness\\".[141] Naomi Merritt explores the film's representation of \\"cannibalistic capitalism\\" in relation to Georges Bataille's theory of taboo and transgression.[142] She elaborates on Wood's analysis, stating that the Sawyer family's values \\"reflect, or correspond to, established and interdependent American institutions... but their embodiment of these social units is perverted and transgressive.\\"[143]\\r\\nIn Kim Newman's view, Hooper's presentation of the Sawyer family during the dinner scene parodies a typical American sitcom family: the gas station owner is the bread-winning father figure; the killer Leatherface is depicted as a bourgeois housewife; the hitchhiker acts as the rebellious teenager.[144] Isabel Cristina Pinedo, author of Recreational Terror: Women and the Pleasures of Horror Film Viewing, states, \\"The horror genre must keep terror and comedy in tension if it is to successfully tread the thin line that separates it from terrorism and parody ... this delicate balance is struck in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in which the decaying corpse of Grandpa not only incorporates horrific and humorous effects, but actually uses one to exacerbate the other.\\"[145]\\r\\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre has also been described as \\"the ultimate pro-vegetarian film\\" due to its animal rights themes. In a video essay, film critic Rob Ager describes the irony in humans being slaughtered for meat, putting humans in the position of being slaughtered like farm animals. Director Tobe Hooper gave up meat while making the film, and said \\"In a way I thought the heart of the film was about meat; its about the chain of life and killing sentient beings.\\"[146][147]\\r\\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre has appeared on various home video formats. In the US, it was first released on videotape and CED in the early 1980s by Wizard Video and Vestron Video.[148][149] The British Board of Film Classification had long since refused a certification for the uncut theatrical version and in 1984 they also refused to certify it for home video, amid a moral panic surrounding \\"video nasties\\".[150] After the retirement of BBFC Director James Ferman in 1999, the board passed the film uncut for theatrical and video distribution with an 18 certificate, almost 25 years after the original release.[151] The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was initially released on DVD in October 1998 in the United States,[152] May 2000 in the United Kingdom[153] and 2001 in Australia.\\r\\nIn 2005 the film received a 2K scan and full restoration from the original 16mm A/B rolls,[154] which was subsequently released on DVD and Blu-ray. In 2014 an additional, even more extensive 4K restoration, using the original 16mm A/B reversal rolls, was carried out.[155] After a screening in the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival,[156] this was also released on DVD and Blu-ray worldwide. Dark Sky Films' US 40th Anniversary Edition was nominated for Best DVD/BD Special Edition Release at the 2015 Saturn Awards.[157]\\r\\nIn 1982, shortly after The Texas Chain Saw Massacre established itself as a success on US home video, Wizard Video released a mass-market video game adaptation for the Atari 2600.[158] In the game, the player assumes the role of Leatherface and attempts to murder trespassers while avoiding obstacles such as fences and cow skulls.[158] As one of the first horror-themed video games, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre caused controversy when it was first released due to its violent nature; it sold poorly as a result, because many game stores refused to stock it.[159][160]\\r\\nThe film has been followed by seven other films to date, including sequels, prequels and remakes. The first sequel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986), was considerably more graphic and violent than the original and was banned in Australia for 20 years before it was released on DVD in a revised special edition in October 2006.[161] Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III (1990) was the second sequel to appear, though Hooper did not return to direct due to scheduling conflicts with another film, Spontaneous Combustion.[162] Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation, starring Rene Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey, was released in 1995. While briefly acknowledging the events of the preceding two sequels, its plot makes it a virtual remake of the 1974 original.[163] A straight remake, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was released by Platinum Dunes and New Line Cinema in 2003.[164] It was followed by a prequel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, in 2006. A seventh film, Texas Chainsaw 3D, was released on January 4, 2013.[164] It is a direct sequel to the original 1974 film, with no relation to the 2003 or 2006 films.[165][166] The 2017 prequel, Leatherface will be released exclusively to DirecTV on September 21, 2017, before receiving a wider release on Video on demand and in limited theaters, simultaneously, in North America on October 20, 2017.\\r\\nThe Academy Film Archive houses the Texas Chain Saw Massacre collection, which contains over 50 items in a collection representing many original elements of the film.[167]","input":"Where did the original texas chainsaw massacre happen?"},{"output":"Zero Divided by Zero Equals Nothing","context":"Nil Battey Sannata (Zero Divided by Zero Equals Nothing; slang for \\"Good For Nothing\\"), released internationally as The New Classmate, is a 2016 Indian comedy drama film directed by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari in her feature debut.

Reviewers praised most aspects of the production, especially its narrative and realism, and the performances of the cast, Bhaskar's in particular. At the 62nd Filmfare Awards, Iyer won the Filmfare Award for Best Debut Director, while Bhaskar and Shukla won the Screen Awards for Best Actress (Critics) and Best Child Artist respectively. The film did well at the box-office, collecting a total of around ?69 million (US$1.1?million) during its entire theatrical run. A Tamil remake, Amma Kanakku, directed by Iyer was released in June 2016 and starred Amala Paul, Revathi and Samuthirakani.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nApeksha \\"Apu\\" Shivlal Sahay (Ria Shukla) is an unmotivated student who has managed to reach her SSC year in school despite her lack of interest in studying further. She struggles in mathematics alongside her friends, Sweety (Neha Prajapati) and Pintu (Prashant Tiwari). Her single mother Chanda (Swara Bhaskar), a high-school drop-out, works four different menial jobs, which include working as a maid for Dr. Diwan (Ratna Pathak Shah).\\r\\nTroubled by her daughter's indifferent attitude, Chanda narrates her dilemma to Dr. Diwan, who suggests that she hire a maths tutor for Apu. Chanda is told that Apu must pass her pre-board math exams to receive a 50?% discount for the crash course tuition. Hearing this, Apu replies that she is destined to work as a maid, as Chanda cannot provide financially for any higher education. With the encouragement of Dr. Diwan, Chanda enrolls herself in Apu's class in her school so that she can learn maths and tutor Apu herself. This embarrasses Apu and she continuously ridicules her mother. No one, except for the school's principal Mr. Srivastava (Pankaj Tripathi), is aware of Chanda's relationship with Apu; she manages to befriend Apu's classmates, including Sweety and Pintu and impresses her teachers with her steady progress. Chanda enlists the help of her shy classmate Amar (Vishal Nath) to understand maths and makes use of mind maps on his advice.\\r\\nApu is angered by her mother's success in maths, as she herself continues to fail to understand it. Chanda challenges Apu to achieve grades higher than hers in maths; if she is successful, Chanda promises to drop out of school. With Amar's help and constant studying, Apu manages to complete the challenge. Her mother is overjoyed, but is heartbroken when Apu informs her that she performed well in school with the sole purpose of ensuring her mother's absence at school. In her anger, Chanda breaks her promise and returns to school, performing even better than before, much to Apu's chagrin. After allotting more time to school, Chanda loses one of her four jobs and begins to work at a restaurant because Amar recommends the job to her since his elder brother Pankaj worked there.\\r\\nOne night, she is dropped off at home by one of her male colleagues; Apu witnesses this and assumes that Chanda has been soliciting. She steals the money that Chanda has been collecting to pay for the maths tuition and spends it all on food, new clothes and sandals. This devastates Chanda, who becomes depressed when Apu tells her that the money was not hard-earned. Chanda stops attending school and continues to work with the hope that Apu will join the Indian Administrative Service, after she is inspired by a kind District Commissioner (Sanjay Suri). In the meantime, Amar helps Apu realize her mistake by making her witness Chanda working at the restaurant and tells her that it was his brother Pankaj who used to drop Chanda back home. Apu rekindles her interest in school and begins to treat her mother with respect, having realized that she can perform well if she possesses the will. She brings her mother back to school and the duo finish their SSC year together.\\r\\nWith a scenic view of the Taj Mahal in the backdrop, Chanda motivates Apu to always follow her dreams, as they are dependent on efforts and not circumstances. A few years later, Apu attends her Union Public Service Commission interview, having passed her examinations successfully. After being asked what inspired her to apply for IAS, she answers that she is inspired by her mother, who now tutors struggling maths students for free.\\r\\nThe cast is listed below:[1]\\r\\nNil Battey Sannata was directed by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari in her directorial debut.[3] She conceived the idea for the film while working with Leo Burnett Worldwide, a Chicago-based advertising company, for a Kaun Banega Crorepati promotional video.[4][5] The screenplay was written by Iyer, Neeraj Singh, Pranjal Choudhary and Nitesh Tiwari.[1][4] In an interview with The Indian Express, Iyer said that \\"the story of Nil Battey Sannata is relevant as well as inspiring\\".[6] The film's title translates to \\"Zero Divided by Zero Equals Nothing\\", and is a slang for \\"Good For Nothing\\".[7]\\r\\nAfter going through the script, JAR Pictures' Ajay G. Rai decided to produce the film, and insisted on Iyer to direct it as well. Although initially reluctant, Iyer agreed to direct and learnt the major aspects of cinematography as a part of her preparation.[4] Gavemic U Ary worked as the cinematographer for the film, and Kunal Sharma headed the sound department. The visual effects were provided by Prasad Film Labs, a motion picture post-production studio based in Hyderabad, and the costumes were designed by Sachin Lovalekar.[1]\\r\\nMukesh Chhabra was the film's casting director.[4] Swara Bhaskar was the first to be cast in the role of Chanda Sahay, a single mother of a 15-year-old girl. Initially sceptical about playing a mother on screen early in her career, she changed her mind after reading the script.[8][9] To understand the role better, Bhaskar stayed with professional domestic helpers from Agra, Uttar Pradesh, where the film is set.[9] She bought such props as a handbag, a comb, a pocket mirror, and rubber chappals.[10] She also drew guidance from her mother's experiences of handling a teenage daughter. After the film's release, Bhaskar said in an interview with Daily News and Analysis that her friends in the Hindi film industry advised her not to take up the role as they felt it would be a \\"career suicide\\" for her. She agreed to participate in the project because \\"the story stayed in [her] mind\\".[9] The next role to be cast was that of the 15-year-old daughter of the protagonist. Ria Shukla was selected for the role after auditions in Lucknow.[4] Ratna Pathak and Pankaj Tripathi play supporting roles in the film.[6][11] A group of around 25 local children played the students at the school.[11]\\r\\nPrincipal photography for Nil Battey Sannata commenced in May 2014 at Agra, and was completed by the end of November.[8] At several locations in Agra, the crew found it difficult to manage an \\"over-enthusiastic crowd\\".[12] The editing process began immediately after, and was supervised by Chandrashekhar Prajapati of the Pixon Studios.[8] The editor's cut was submitted for the Work-in-Progress Lab at the NFDC Film Bazaar.[13] Distributed by Eros International in India, Nil Battey Sannata's final cut ran for a total of 104 minutes.[14][15]\\r\\nThe music for Nil Battey Sannata was composed by newcomers Rohan and Vinayak, with Manoj Yadav, Nitesh Tiwari and Shreyas Jain as lyricists for the soundtrack.[16][17] Joginder Tuteja's mixed review for Bollywood Hungama was largely appreciative of the songs \\"Murabba\\" and \\"Maths Mein Dabba Gul\\", also acknowledging the soundtrack's \\"rural flavor\\". He deemed the overall album to be \\"strictly situational\\".[16] The Times of India critic Mohar Basu gave the soundtrack a 3 out 5 star rating, saying that the \\"album wins you over with its innocence\\". Praising the pleasant \\"Murabba\\" and the catchy \\"Maths Mein Dabba\\", he asserted that the film \\"has music that will touch your heart\\".[18]\\r\\nThe film had its world premiere in the last week of September 2015 at the Silk Road Film Festival, Fuzhou, China.[20] It was released under the title of The New Classmate, as it was at such international film festivals like the Marrakech International Film Festival and the Cleveland International Film Festival.[21][22][23] The film then went on to be screened at the BFI London Film Festival (LFF) on 23 October 2015, and was lauded at the event.[3] The release of the first look of the film coincided with the International Women's Day, 8 March.[24] In the poster of the film, a smiling Swara Bhaskar is seen taking a leap with Ria Shukla in a red sari and a blue salwar kameez respectively. The poster was unveiled by the actress Sonam Kapoor, a close friend of Bhaskar.[24] The official trailer was released by Eros productions on 22 March 2016.[25] The launch took place at a media session in a classroom set-up with Bhaskar, Shukla and Pankaj Tripathi.[26] At the event, the film's producer Anand L Rai said, \\"I associated with Nil Battey Sannata straight from my heart and I'm feeling very proud of the film.\\"[27] The trailer was well received by both critics and audiences.[26][27] A reviewer for Daily News and Analysis thought of it as \\"heartwarming\\".[28] The film had its theatrical release in India on 22 April 2016.[29]\\r\\nNil Battey Sannata released in India on fewer than 300 screens and had an average opening at the box-office. It collected ?2.5 million (US$39,000) on its opening, but the figure grew on the second day as a result of positive word of mouth reviews.[30] The film collected ?6.0 million (US$94,000) on Saturday and ?10.5 million (US$160,000) on Sunday bringing the opening weekend collections to ?19 million (US$300,000).[31] The film faced competition from other small-budget Hindi film releases Laal Rang and Santa Banta Pvt Ltd in its opening weekend at the box-office, but was expected to do well because of the positive reviews and good word of mouth.[32] The film collected ?30 million (US$470,000) in its opening week.[33] It was declared tax free in the states of Uttar Pradesh and New Delhi by their respective state governments.[34][35] The film became a commercial success, and continued thought the second week, increasing in rural areas of the country.[36] It had an impressive six-week run at the box office and its lifetime collections were around ?70 million (US$1.1?million).[2]\\r\\nNil Battey Sannata opened to critical acclaim, and was positively received by the audiences as well.[37] It received overwhelming praise, chiefly for the direction, and for Bhaskar, Shukla and Tripathi. Kunal Guha of the Mumbai Mirror wrote, \\"It's rare to come across films that force you to keep aside your yardsticks of what a good film is and dive into the experience\\".[38] Namrata Thakur of Rediff.com gave the film the highest praise and deemed it \\"an absolute gem\\", saying \\"there is hardly a dull moment in the film\\". She considered it the feel-good film of the year, comparing it to 2015's Dum Laga Ke Haisha.[39] The Hindu journalist and film critic Namrata Joshi included Nil Battey Sannata in her year-end list of \\"Hindi films that made a mark in 2016\\".[40] She thought of it \\"a warm, feel-good film which offers hope and the promise\\".[41]\\r\\nThe realism in the portrayal of the characters, and the universal theme of the film was widely lauded by critics. Gautaman Bhaskaran of Hindustan Times gave it 4 stars out of 5 and remarked that the film \\"is a powerful and honest work\\",[42] and Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express noted that \\"the film relies on keeping things real\\".[43] Mohar Basu in his review at The Times of India described the movie as \\"unpretentious\\", saying that \\"the movie wins you over with its innocence and simplicity\\".[15] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV said the film resonated as \\"a disarmingly simple and heart-warming film\\".[44] Suparna Sharma of Deccan Chronicle called it a \\"real film in a real setting about real people that delivers several empowering, powerful messages\\".[45]\\r\\nThe performances of the lead cast were chiefly praised by critics. Joshi, who was particularly impressed with the performances of Tripathi and Shukla, ascribed the film's appeal to its well-etched characters and their relationships which were \\"brought alive by a nicely put together ensemble cast\\".[41] The view was shared by Rachit Gupta of Filmfare, who noted that \\"the actors make this film so memorable\\". He gave Bhaskar the highest praise, saying that she delivered the \\"performance of a lifetime\\", while also praising Shukla's \\"super\\", Pathak's \\"phenomenal\\" and Tripathi's \\"masterclass\\" performances.[46] In his review, CNN-News18 film critic Rajeev Masand deemed Bhaskar to be \\"the heart of the film\\" noting that with \\"not one note out of place, she grabs your attention\\".[47] Udita Jhunjhunwala of Firstpost praised Bhaksar, stating that \\"This is one of her most nuanced performances and a welcome change\\", and highlighted Tripathi, calling him the \\"scene-stealer as the zealous school principal\\".[48]\\r\\nIn November 2015, Iyer agreed terms to direct a remake of the film in Tamil, for producers Dhanush and Anand L Rai. Dhanush had been shown a preview of the film by Rai, during a visit to Mumbai in September 2015 and the duo chose to co-produce the film, with Iyer retained as director.[49] The roles played by Bhaskar, Shukla, Pathak, and Tripathi were essayed by Amala Paul, Yuvasri, Revathi, and Samuthirakani respectively in the remake, titled Amma Kanakku, which released on 24 June 2016.[50]\\r\\nThe film was also remade in Malayalam as Udaharanam Sujatha (2017) where the role of Swara Bhaskar was portrayed by Manju Warrier.","input":"What is the meaning of nil battey sannata?"},{"output":"Jan. 1977","context":"Black Panther is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Jack Kirby, first appearing in Fantastic Four #52 (cover-dated July 1966) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Black Panther's real name is T'Challa, king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies.\\r\\nBlack Panther is the first superhero of African descent in mainstream American comics, having debuted years before early African American superheroes such as Marvel Comics' the Falcon (1969), Luke Cage (1972) and Blade (1973), or DC Comics' John Stewart in the role of Green Lantern (1971). In one comic book storyline, the Black Panther mantle is handled by Kasper Cole, a multiracial New York City police officer. Beginning as an impersonator, Cole would later take on the moniker of White Tiger and become an ally to T'Challa. The role of Black Panther and leadership of Wakanda is also given to T'Challa's sister Shuri for a short time.\\r\\nBlack Panther has made numerous appearances in various television shows, animated films and video games. The character is portrayed in live action by Chadwick Boseman in the 2016 film Captain America: Civil War, and the 2018 films Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\\r\\nIn 2011, Black Panther was ranked 51st overall on IGN's \\"Top 100 Comic Books Heroes\\" list.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Black Panther's name predates the October 1966 founding of the Black Panther Party, though not the black panther logo of the party's predecessor, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO), nor the segregated World War II Black Panthers Tank Battalion.[2][3] Stan Lee, co-creator of the comic, denied that the comic was named after any of the political uses of the term \\"black panther\\", including the LCFO, citing \\"a strange coincidence\\".[4] He is the first black superhero in American mainstream comic books; very few black heroes were created before him, and none with actual superpowers. These included the characters in the single-issue, low-distribution All-Negro Comics #1 (1947); Waku, Prince of the Bantu, who starred in his own feature in the omnibus title Jungle Tales, from Marvel's 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics; and the Dell Comics Western character Lobo, the first black person to star in his own comic book. Previous non-caricatured black supporting characters in comics include U.S. Army infantry private Gabriel Jones of Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos.\\r\\nIn a guest appearance in Fantastic Four #119 (Feb. 1972), the Black Panther briefly tried using the name Black Leopard to avoid connotations with the Party, but the new name did not last.[5] The character's name was changed back to Black Panther in Avengers #105, with T'Challa explaining that renaming himself made as much sense as altering the Scarlet Witch's name, and he is not a stereotype.[6]\\r\\nCo-creator Stan Lee recounted that the name was inspired by a pulp adventure hero who has a black panther as a helper.[7] Jack Kirby's original concept art for Black Panther used the concept name Coal Tiger.[8]\\r\\nFollowing his debut in Fantastic Four #52ÿ53 (JulyÿAug. 1966) and subsequent guest appearance in Fantastic Four Annual #5 (1967) and with Captain America in Tales of Suspense #97ÿ100 (Jan.ÿ April 1968), the Black Panther journeyed from the fictional African nation of Wakanda to New York City to join the titular American superhero team in The Avengers #52 (May 1968), appearing in that comic for the next few years. During his time with the Avengers, he made solo guest-appearances in three issues of Daredevil, and fought Doctor Doom in Astonishing Tales #6ÿ7 (June & Aug. 1971), in that supervillain's short-lived starring feature.\\r\\nHe received his first starring feature with Jungle Action #5 (July 1973), a reprint of the Panther-centric story in The Avengers #62 (March 1969). A new series began running the following issue, written by Don McGregor, with art by pencilers Rich Buckler, Gil Kane, and Billy Graham, and which gave inkers Klaus Janson and Bob McLeod some of their first professional exposure. The critically acclaimed[9] series ran in Jungle Action #6ÿ24 (Sept. 1973 ÿ Nov. 1976).[10]\\r\\nOne now-common format McGregor pioneered was that of the self-contained, multi-issue story arc.[11] The first, \\"Panther's Rage\\", ran through the first 13 issues. Critic Jason Sacks has called the arc \\"Marvel's first graphic novel\\":\\r\\n[T]here were real character arcs in Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four [comics] over time. But ... \\"Panther's Rage\\" is the first comic that was created from start to finish as a complete novel. Running in two years' issues of Jungle Action (#s 6 through 18), \\"Panther's Rage\\" is a 200-page novel that journeys to the heart of the African nation of Wakanda, a nation ravaged by a revolution against its king, T'Challa, the Black Panther.[11]\\r\\nThe second and final arc, \\"Panther vs. the Klan\\", ran as mostly 17-page stories in Jungle Action #19ÿ24 (Jan.ÿNov. 1976), except for issue #23, a reprint of Daredevil #69 (Oct. 1970), in which the Black Panther guest-starred.[10] The subject matter of the Ku Klux Klan was considered controversial in the Marvel offices at the time, creating difficulties for the creative team.[12]\\r\\nAfrican-American writer-editor Dwayne McDuffie said of the Jungle Action \\"Black Panther\\" feature:\\r\\nThis overlooked and underrated classic is arguably the most tightly written multi-part superhero epic ever. If you can get your hands on it ... sit down and read the whole thing. It's damn-near flawless, every issue, every scene, a functional, necessary part of the whole. Okay, now go back and read any individual issue. You'll find seamlessly integrated words and pictures; clearly introduced characters and situations; a concise (sometimes even transparent) recap; beautifully developed character relationships; at least one cool new villain; a stunning action set piece to test our hero's skills and resolve; and a story that is always moving forward towards a definite and satisfying conclusion. That's what we should all be delivering, every single month. Don [McGregor] and company did it in only 17 story pages per issue.[9]\\r\\nThough popular with college students, the overall sales of Jungle Action were low,[13] and Marvel relaunched the Black Panther in a self-titled series, bringing in the character's co-creator Jack Kirbynewly returned to Marvel after having decamped to rival DC Comics for a timeas writer, penciler, and editor. However, Kirby wanted to work on new characters and was unhappy at being assigned a series starring a character he had already worked with extensively.[14] He left the series after only 12 issues and was replaced by Ed Hannigan (writer), Jerry Bingham (penciler), and Roger Stern (editor). Black Panther ran 15 issues (Jan. 1977 ÿ May 1979).[15] Due to the series's cancellation, the contents of what would have been Black Panther #16ÿ18 were published in Marvel Premiere #51ÿ53.\\r\\nA four-issue miniseries, Black Panther vol. 2,[16] (JulyÿOct. 1988) was written by Peter B. Gillis and penciled by Denys Cowan.[17] McGregor revisited his Panther saga with Gene Colan in \\"Panther's Quest\\", published as 25 eight-page installments within the bi-weekly anthology series Marvel Comics Presents (issues #13ÿ37, Feb.ÿDec. 1989).[18] He later teamed with artist Dwayne Turner in the square-bound miniseries Black Panther: Panther's Prey (Sept. 1990 ÿ March 1991).[19] McGregor conceived a fifth arc in his Black Panther saga, titled \\"Panther's Vows\\", but it failed to get off the ground.[13]\\r\\nWriter Christopher Priest's and penciller Mark Texeira's 1998 series The Black Panther vol. 3 used Erik Killmonger, Venomm, and other characters introduced in \\"Panther's Rage\\", together with new characters such as State Department attorney Everett Ross; the Black Panther's adopted brother, Hunter; and the Panther's protg, Queen Divine Justice. The Priest-Texeira series was under the Marvel Knights imprint in its first year. Priest said the creation of character Ross contributed heavily to his decision to write the series. \\"I realized I could use Ross to bridge the gap between the African culture that the Black Panther mythos is steeped in and the predominantly white readership that Marvel sells to,\\" adding that in his opinion, the Black Panther had been misused in the years after his creation.[20]\\r\\nThe last 13 issues (#50ÿ62) saw the main character replaced by a multiracial New York City police officer named Kasper Cole, with T'Challa relegated to a supporting character. This Black Panther, who became the White Tiger, was placed in the series The Crew, running concurrently with the final few Black Panther issues. The Crew was canceled with issue #7.\\r\\nIn 2005, Marvel began publishing Black Panther vol. 4,[21] which ran 41 issues (April 2005 ÿ Nov. 2008).[22] It was initially written by filmmaker Reginald Hudlin (through issue #38) and penciled by John Romita, Jr. (through #6). Hudlin said he wanted to add \\"street cred\\" to the title, although he noted that the book was not necessarily or primarily geared toward an African-American readership.[23] As influences for his characterization of the character, Hudlin has cited comic character Batman, film director Spike Lee, and music artist Sean Combs.[23] Other influences include historical figures such as 14th-century Mali Empire sultan Mansa Musa and 20th-century Jamaican activist Marcus Garvey, as well as Biblical figures such as Ham and Canaan.[24]\\r\\nBlack Panther vol. 5[25] launched in February 2009, with Hudlin, again scripting, introducing a successor Black Panther, T'Challa's sister Shuri.[26][27][28] Hudlin co-wrote issue #7 with Jonathan Maberry, who then became the new writer,[29] joined by artist Will Conrad.[30] The Panther was also a featured player, with members of the Fantastic Four and the X-Men, in the Doctor Doom-based, six-issue miniseries Doomwar (AprilÿSept. 2010).[31]\\r\\nT'Challa then accepted an invitation from Matt Murdock, the superhero Daredevil, to become the new protector of New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. He became the lead character in Daredevil beginning with issue #513 (Feb. 2011), when that series was retitled Black Panther: The Man Without Fear.[32] Under writer David Liss and artist Francesco Francavilla, he took on the identity of Mr. Okonkwo, an immigrant from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and becomes the owner of a small diner in order to be close to the people.[33]\\r\\nA new Black Panther series written by Ta-Nehisi Coates and drawn by Brian Stelfreeze was launched in 2016 and continues to be published with Coates as the head writer.[34][35][36]\\r\\nIn 2017, the afrofuturist writer Nnedi Okorafor wrote the series Black Panther: Long Live the King.[37]\\r\\nThe Black Panther is the ceremonial title given to the chief of the Panther Tribe of the advanced African nation of Wakanda. In addition to ruling the country, he is also chief of its various tribes (collectively referred to as the Wakandas). The Panther habit is a symbol of office (head of state) and is used even during diplomatic missions. The Panther is a hereditary title, but one must still earn it.\\r\\nIn the distant past, a meteorite made of the (fictional) vibration-absorbing mineral vibranium crashed in Wakanda, and was unearthed. Reasoning that outsiders would exploit Wakanda for this valuable resource, the ruler, King T'Chaka, like his father and other Panthers before him, concealed his country from the outside world. T'Chaka's first wife N'Yami died while in labor with T'Challa, and his second wife Ramonda was taken prisoner by Anton Pretorius during a visit to her homeland of South Africa, so for most of his childhood T'Challa was raised by his father alone.[38] T'Chaka was murdered by the adventurer Ulysses Klaw in an attempt to seize the vibranium mound. With his people still in danger, a young T'Challa used Klaw's sound weapon on Klaw and his men, shattering Klaw's right hand and forcing him to flee.[39]\\r\\nT'Challa was next in line to be the king of Wakanda and Black Panther, but until he was ready to become the leader of the nation, his uncle S'yan (T'Chaka's younger brother) successfully passed the trials to become the Black Panther. While on his Wakandan walkabout rite of passage, T'Challa met and fell in love with apparent orphaned teen Ororo Munroe, who would grow up to become the X-Men member Storm.[40] The two broke off their relationship due to his desire to avenge his father's death and to become the type of man who could suitably lead Wakanda, but they would see each other over the years when they could.\\r\\nT'Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the various champions of the Wakandan tribes. One of his first acts was to disband and exile the Hatut Zerazethe Wakandan secret policeand its leader, his adopted brother Hunter the White Wolf.[41] He sold off small portions of vibranium to scientific institutions around the world, amassing a fortune which he used to arm himself with advanced technology.[39] Later, to keep peace, he picked dora milaje (\\"adored ones\\") from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives-in-training. He then studied abroad for a time before returning to his kingship.\\r\\nIn his first published appearance, the now-adult T'Challa invites the American superhero team the Fantastic Four to Wakanda, then attacks and attempts to neutralize them individually in order to test himself to see if he is ready to battle Klaw, who had replaced his shattered right hand with a sonic weapon.[42][43] For their part, the Four manage to rally and stymie T'Challa in a team counter-attack, enabling the impressed King to stand down and explain himself to the team's satisfaction. After the ruler makes proper amends to the Four, they befriend and help T'Challa, and he in turn aids them against the supervillain the Psycho-Man.[44] T'Challa later joins the Avengers,[45] beginning a long association with that superhero team. He first battles the Man-Ape while with the group,[46] and then meets the American singer Monica Lynne,[47] with whom he becomes romantically involved. He helps the Avengers defeat the second Sons of the Serpent, and then reveals his true identity on American television.[48] He encounters Daredevil, and reveals to him that he had deduced Daredevil's true identity.[49]\\r\\nAfter receiving numerous urgent official letters requesting him to return to his increasingly troubled homeland,[50] the Panther eventually leaves his active Avengers membership to return to a Wakanda on the brink of civil war, bringing Lynne with him. After defeating would-be usurper Erik Killmonger and his minions,[51] the Panther ventures to the American South to battle the Ku Klux Klan.[52] He later gains possession of the mystical time-shifting artifacts known as King Solomon's Frogs.[53] These produce an alternate version of T'Challa from a future 10 years hence, a merry, telepathic Panther with a terminal brain aneurysm, whom T'Challa places in cryogenic stasis.\\r\\nLater, while searching for and finding his stepmother Ramonda, the Panther contends with South African authorities during Apartheid.[54] T'Challa eventually proposes and becomes engaged to Monica Lynne,[55] though the couple never marry.\\r\\nYears later, the Panther accepts a Washington, D.C. envoy, Everett K. Ross, and faces multiple threats to Wakanda's sovereignty. Ross assists him in many of these threats. In gratitude, the Panther often risks much for Ross in return. The first threat he and Ross encounter is \\"Xcon\\", an alliance of rogue intelligence agents backing a coup led by the Reverend Achebe.[56] Afterward, Killmonger resurfaces with a plot to destroy Wakanda's economy. This forces T'Challa to nationalize foreign companies.[57] Killmonger then defeats him in ritual combat, thus inheriting the role of Black Panther,[58] but falls into a coma upon eating the heart-shaped herbpoisonous to anyone outside the royal bloodline, which had a hereditary immunity to its toxic effects.[59] T'Challa preserves his rival's life rather than allowing him to die.\\r\\nLater, T'Challa finds he has a brain aneurysm like his alternate future self, and succumbs to instability and hallucinations. After his mental state almost causes tribal warfare, the Panther hands power to his council[60] and hides in New York City. There he mentors police officer Kasper Cole (who had adopted an abandoned Panther costume), an experience that gives T'Challa the strength to face his illness, reclaim his position, and return to active membership in the Avengers, whom he helps secure special United Nations status.\\r\\nT'Challa recounts the story of his ascension as the Black Panther in the fourth volume of his eponymous comic book series. He defeated his uncle during the Black Panther celebration,[61] and during his walkabout when he met and fell in love with a street urchin named Ororo in Cairo, Egypt.[62] Unbeknownst to him the US government is planning a coup in order to get access to the vibranium. They allow Klaw to recruit a team of villains in order to support his totalitarian neighbor, Niganda. Klaw recruits Rhino, Black Knight, Batroc the Leaper, and Radioactive Man to lead the invasion. The US government then deploys an army of Deathloks to \\"support\\" T'Challa and justify an invasion, but T'Challa kills Klaw and Storm wipes out the Deathlok army in a hurricane.[63]\\r\\nT'Challa then helps his old flame Ororo Munroe reunite with her surviving family members in Africa and the U.S.[64] He shortly afterward proposes,[volume?&?issue?needed] and the two are married in a large Wakandan ceremony attended by many superheroes.[65] One of the couple's first tasks is to embark on a diplomatic tour, in which they visit the Inhumans, Doctor Doom, the President of the United States, and Namor, with only the last one ending well.[66] After the death of Bill Foster, the Black Panther and Storm side with Captain America's anti-registration forces.[67] During the end battle between both sides, the Wakandan embassy in Manhattan is heavily damaged, though no Wakandans are hurt.[68] After the confrontation, the Panther and Storm briefly fill in for vacationing Fantastic Four members Reed and Sue Richards before returning to Wakanda.[69]\\r\\nUpon returning to Wakanda alone, leaving Storm in New York to aid the X-Men, Black Panther faces Erik Killmonger, defeating him with assistance from Monica Rambeau (a.k.a. Pulsar).[70] Afterward, Wakanda fends off the alien shapeshifters the Skrulls, who had infiltrated as part of their \\"Secret Invasion\\" plan to conquer Earth.[71] Prince Namor attempts to recruit T'Challa for the Cabal, a secret council of supervillains. Attacked by the forces of fellow Cabal member Doctor Doom, T'Challa is left comatose.[72] His sister Shuri is trained as the next Panther, with the mantle passing onto her officially after T'Challa awakens from his coma and attempts to recover from his injuries.[73]\\r\\nIn the aftermath, T'Challa loses all of his enhanced attributes given to him by being the panther totem. As a result, he works with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to accumulate a replacement.[74] He has since made a pact with another unknown Panther deity, returning his attributes to an even higher level as well as placing incantations on his body, making himself highly resistant to most magic and mystic assaults. This has all been done in preparation for the imminent battle with Doctor Doom,[75] which culminated in T'Challa rendering all of the processed vibranium inert to give his people a chance to rebuild without their dependence on the element.[76]\\r\\nAfter the events of \\"Shadowland\\", Matt Murdock (the superhero Daredevil) asks T'Challa to replace him as guardian of Hell's Kitchen, which gives T'Challa a chance to discover himself. With the help of Foggy Nelson, T'Challa assumes the identity of Mr. Okonkwo, an immigrant from the Congo and manager of a diner called Devil's Kitchen, so that he can blend in and learn about the denizens as an ordinary man. He gets on well with two of the Kitchen's staff: Sofija, a migrant from Serbia who was formerly involved in violent Serbian nationalism, and the busboy, Brian. He also gets to know some of the neighbors from his apartment block: Mr. Nantakarn and his son Alec, as well as Iris, a social worker assigned to handle cases of child abuse.[77]\\r\\nT'Challa finds himself up against an ambitious new crime lord, Vlad Dinu, who styles himself \\"The Impaler\\". He also seeks an understanding with the police through Detective Alex Kurtz. During an attempt by Vlad to terminate the Panther, Brian from the Devil's Kitchen is seriously injured by an energy blast from Vlad, and is reported dead. The conflict between Vlad and the Panther becomes more personal, especially after Vlad discovers the Panther over his wife Angela dead from a gunshot wound.[77]\\r\\nT'Challa learns that Iris was the serial shooter who killed abusers of childrenGabe was abused secretly by Angela. Brian was kidnapped by his doctor, Dr. Holman, at the behest of Nicolae who wanted to use someone who received a dose of Vlad's power. After being subjected to torturous experiments, Brian lost the ability to think for himself but was rescued by Gabe who also stole the serum produced from the experiment meant to endow the recipient with Vlad's powers. The Panther obtains evidence of Vlad Dinu's crimes as well as clues to Iris as the serial shooter, and turns the evidence over to Kurtz. Vlad kills his own son Nicolae before being subdued by the Panther. Gabe is arrested for attempting to take Iris' life. Before being taken away, Gabe reveals to the Panther Brian's fate. Though aware of the Panther's identity as Mr. Okonkwo, both Iris and Sofija promise to keep silent.[77]\\r\\nShortly after Daredevil returns to Hell's Kitchen, T'Challa returns to Wakanda, serving as a second to his sister, Shuri. In preparation for an upcoming attack on Wakanda as part of the Avengers vs. X-Men storyline, the Panther God returns T'Challa's abilities.[78] Empowered by the Phoenix, Namor destroys Wakanda with a massive tidal wave.[79] Returning to help, Storm is stunned when the Panther informs her that their marriage has been annulled.[80]\\r\\nAfter witnessing an alternate Earth over Wakanda being destroyed by the Black Swan, T'Challa reforms the Illuminatiwith Beast replacing the now-deceased Charles Xavierto confront the threat of the Incursions, parallel universes colliding with each other to the destruction of both. Although able to avert one Incursion with the Infinity Gauntlet, the subsequent destruction of the Infinity Gems forces the group to decide to resort to more questionable measures to protect Earth from future Incursions, wiping Captain America's mind so that he will not remember these events, allowing them to do \\"what needs to be done\\".[81] Although equipped with planet-destroying weapons to protect Earth, the Illuminati mostly become disgusted with the wholesale slaughter, until Namor breaks off from the group to form a new Cabal of villains to do what the heroes will not. Despite Namor's Cabal achieving legitimacy as Earth's protectors, Namor grew weary of the wholesale slaughter they carried out in the name of preserving their universe. Although he collaborated with the Illuminati in a plan to destroy the Cabal by trapping them on the next Earth to be destroyed, Black Panther and Black Bolt left him behind to die with the Cabal, disgusted at his earlier actions,[82] although Namor and the Cabal escape to the Ultimate universe when the other Earth has a simultaneous Incursion.[83]\\r\\nWhen the final Incursion occurs during the Secret Wars storyline, resulting in all realities collapsing into one Earth, Black Panther is one of the few heroes to survive the Incursion in a specially-designed \\"life pod\\"other survivors including Mister Fantastic, Star-Lord, Spider-Man, the new Thor, Captain Marvel and a Phoenix-enhanced Cyclopsalthough they are only released into the new world after an eight-year stasis. Retrieved by Doctor Strange, they learn that Strange has assumed a role of \\"sheriff\\" to Doctor Doom, who has appointed himself the god of the new \\"Battleworld\\" created from the multiple realities.[84] Although Doom effortlessly kills Cyclops, Strange protects the other heroes by dispersing them across Battleworld,[85] with T'Challa and Namor eventually discovering a new version of the Infinity Gauntlet that Strange collected, ensuring that the Gems he found would work in the location where Doom built his main fortress.[86] Recruiting the residents of the deadlands as an army, T'Challa marches on Doom at the same time as multiple other areas rebel against him through the encouragement of the heroes,[87] but admits when Doom confronts him that he was only intended as a distraction while Reed targets Doom's power source. As Reed takes Doom's power and sets out to rebuild the multiverse, T'Challa uses the Time Gem to take himself back to Wakanda before the Incursions, proclaiming to his people that they will lead the way to the stars and explore new ideas.[88]\\r\\nAs part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel, Black Panther is a member of the Ultimates.[89]\\r\\nDuring the Civil War II storyline, Black Panther represents Wakanda on the Alpha Flight Space Program's Board of Governors.[90] He sides with Captain Marvel on needing help from an Inhuman who can predict the possible future named Ulysses Kain.[volume?&?issue?needed] Black Panther and Shuri take part in the fight against the Leviathon Tide.[91]\\r\\nDuring Hydra's reign over the world led by Arnim Zola, Baron Zemo and Steve Rogers, Panther is captured for opposing this regime, and brought into a containing room. Once Panther and Zemo are alone, Winter Soldier rescues Panther. Panther entrusts the unconscious Zemo to Winter Soldier, while trailing Rogers and Zola into the secret lab. Panther finds out that Zola infused a brainwashed Captain America with a Cosmic Cube using a stolen Stark tech modified by Zola himself, and warns his allies to retreat from a Cosmic Cube-powered Steve Rogers, but is too late.[92] Even though one of the heroes knows they cannot defeat a Cosmic Cube-powered Supreme Hydra Rogers, Winter Soldier, Captain America (Sam Wilson) and Ant-Man (Scott Lang) trick Rogers by surrendering the last fragment of the cube to him. Winter Soldier and Ant-Man steal the cube from Rogers before he uses its full potential, and bring back Kobik and the real Steve Rogers.[93][94] After the defeat of Supreme Hydra Steve Rogers, Black Panther establishes his quest to go across the universe with his people, and found an Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda on Planet Bast, located in the Benhazin Star System.[95]\\r\\nThe title \\"Black Panther\\" is a rank of office, chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan. As chieftain, the Panther is entitled to eat a special heart-shaped herb which, in addition to his mystical, shamanistic connection with the Wakandan Panther God Bast, grants him superhumanly acute senses, enhanced strength, speed, agility, stamina, durability, healing, and reflexes.[96][97]\\r\\nHe has since lost this connection and forged a new one with another unknown Panther deity, granting him augmented physical attributes as well as a resistance to magic.[75] His senses are so powerful that he can pick up a prey's scent and memorize tens of thousands of individual ones. Following his war with Doom, T'Challa loses his enhanced abilities only to once again establish a connection with the Panther God.[78] In addition to the resurgence of his now superhuman abilities, he is anointed \\"King of the Dead\\", granting him the power and knowledge of all the past Black Panthers as well as the ability to control the Undead.[98] After Battleworld and the resurgence of the Multiverse T'challa eventually showcased new powers in regards to his King of the Dead status, for not only could he reanimate the dead but summon departed spirits into the physical world with tangible form as well. Using these spiritual energies also enables him to conjure a mythical mystical spear of glowing blue energy to his hand.[99]\\r\\nT'Challa worked with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to endow T'Challa with immunity to mystical attacks and detection in order to defeat Dr. Doom. When T'Challa's alchemical upgrade was tested by means of Wakanda's most powerful acolytes attacking T'Challa in unison, each mystical attack was absorbed and only served to strengthen T'Challa. During these preparations, T'Challa invented a potent mystical-scientific hybrid art called \\"shadow physics\\" and was able to use it to craft shadow weapons and to track vibranium on a quantum level.[75]\\r\\nAs king of Wakanda, the Panther has access to a vast collection of magical artifacts, advanced Wakandan technological and military hardware, and the support of his nation's wide array of scientists, warriors, and mystics. The Wakandan military has been described as one of the most powerful on Earth. His attire is the sacred vibranium costume of the Wakandan Panther Cult.\\r\\nHe is a skilled hunter, tracker, strategist, politician, inventor, and scientist. He has a PhD in physics from Oxford University. He is proficient in physics and advanced technology, and is also an inventor. T'Challa has been granted the strength and knowledge of every past Black Panther.[78]\\r\\nT'Challa is rigorously trained in acrobatics and hand-to-hand combat. He is skilled in various forms of unarmed combat, with a unique hybrid fighting style that incorporates acrobatics and aspects of animal mimicry.[100]\\r\\nThe chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan is one of the wealthiest people in the world, although financial estimates are difficult given Wakanda's isolation from the world's economy and the uncertain value of Wakanda's vast vibranium reserves and extremely advanced technologies.[101]\\r\\nIn Black Panther volume 3, writer Christopher Priest expanded the Panther's day-to-day arsenal to include equipment such as an \\"energy dagger\\", a vibranium-weave suit, and a portable supercomputer, the \\"Kimoyo card\\".[102] In Black Panther volume 4, writer Reginald Hudlin introduced such specialized equipment as \\"thrice-blessed armor\\" and \\"light armor\\" for specific tasks,[103] and for a short while outfitted him with the Ebony Blade of the Black Knight.[104]\\r\\nThe mantle of the Black Panther is passed down from generation to generation among the rulers of Wakanda[105] although it must still be deserved through a severe selection involving the best warriors of the nation.\\r\\nBashenga appeared for the first time in Black Panther Vol. 1 #7 (January 1978) by Jack Kirby (scripts and drawings). Wise warrior at the head of the Panther Tribe, according to legends, during the tumult where the vibranium meteorite fell on the soil of the village, then composed of various warring clans, he gathered all the aforementioned under his guide to defeating the inhabitants transformed by the impact into fierce \\"demonic spirits\\", a company which has unified the nation by founding Wakanda and becoming its first ruler[106] and the first to obtain the title of \\"Black Panther\\" as it tells of his \\"spiritual connection\\" with the Goddess Pantera Bast that led to the foundation of the Cult of the Panther.[105]\\r\\nChanda appeared for the first time in Fantastic Four Unlimited Vol. 1 #1 (March 1993) by Roy Thomas (scripts) and Herb Trimpe (drawings). Black Panther and ruler of Wakanda during the Second World War, Chanda is the husband of Nanali and father of T'Chaka and S'Yan; distinguished by an excessively good and compassionate nature, he welcomed the Nazi colonel Fritz Klaue after he crashed into his reign due to a plane crash. Over time, the two make a kind of friendship and Klaue develops a strong obsession with the culture of Wakanda coming to try to convince them to make their religion deist rather than spiritist, which causes a strong friction between him and Chanda culminating in the death of Nanali by the Nazi and in its subsequent expulsion from the country.[107]\\r\\nIn several subsequent stories, T'Chaka's father (and husband of Nanali) is called Azzuri the Wise and is presented in a completely different way from Chanda,[108][109] leaving the doubt if it is only a sort of nickname or another character.\\r\\nT'Chaka appeared for the first time in Fantastic Four Vol. 1 #53 (August 1966) by Stan Lee (script) and Jack Kirby (art). The eldest son of King Azzuri and Queen Nanali, T'Chaka inherits the throne and the title of the Black Panther on his father's death by being helped in his monarch duties by his younger brother and trusted adviser S'Yan.[110] After having married a woman named N'Yami, believing she can not have children, she adopts a child with her, Hunter, however, she later becomes pregnant and dies giving birth to her first child, T'Challa; from the relationship with a woman of another tribe T'Chaka then has a second son, Jakarra, and finally remarries with Ramonda, a woman who grows her children as her own and from whom she has her only daughter, Shuri,[110] but which subsequently disappears into nothingness, leading him to believe that he has abandoned it.[38] To protect the kingdom, T'Chaka instituted a policy of strong isolationism,[111] but in the course of his life he often collaborated with agents of the US government.[109][112] He is killed by Ulysses Klaw after having surprised him to illegally extract vibranium in his kingdom.[113]\\r\\nIn Black Panther Vol. 3 #15 (February 2000), Erik Killmonger challenges and bests T'Challa in a duel for the throne, overthrowing him as king of Wakanda and taking on the role as the Black Panther.[114] He becomes comatose after attempting to ingest the Heart-shaped Herb to acquire the Black Panther's powers, as he is not of royal blood. Killmonger's time as king is short-lived however, as he is killed by Monica Rambeau during T'Challa's attack to reclaim Wakanda.[115]\\r\\nS'Yan The Fast, appeared for the first time in Black Panther Vol. 4 #2 (May, 2005) by Reginald Hudlin (scripts) and John Romita Jr. (drawings). The second son of King Azzuri and Queen Nanali, S'Yan is T'Chaka's younger and trusted advisor, after whose death, although he has no desire to reign, he agrees to ascend the throne until his nephew became an adult.[110] Ironically, S'Yan, who has never wanted to be king, becomes one of the most beloved monarchs in the history of Wakanda but, nevertheless, when T'Challa returns home and obtains the title of Black Panther, he leaves with joy, returning to play the role of royal adviser.[110] He died during the war with Latveria to defend Ramonda from the soldiers of Doctor Doom.\\r\\nWhen T'Challa ends up in a coma because of Doctor Doom,[116] Shuri becomes his substitute as Black Panther and queen of Wakanda which, after the rise of her half-brother to \\"king of the dead\\", creates for the first time in history two avatars of the Panther Goddess.\\r\\nBlack Panther was ranked the 79th greatest comic book character by Wizard magazine.[120] IGN ranked the character the 51st greatest comic book hero, stating that Black Panther could be considered Marvel's equivalent to Batman;[121] he was also ranked tenth in their list of \\"The Top 50 Avengers\\".[122] In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked the Black Panther as #33 on their list of the \\"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\\".[123]\\r\\nJournalist Joe Gross praised Christopher Priest for his characterization of the Black Panther, stating, that the writer \\"turned an underused icon into the locus of a complicated high adventure by taking the Black Panther to his logical conclusion. T'Challa (the title character) is the enigmatic ruler of a technologically advanced, slightly xenophobic African nation, so he acts like it\\". Gross applauded the title's \\"endless wit, sharp characterization, narrative sophistication and explosive splash panels\\".[124]\\r\\nComics reviewer and journalist Mike Sangiacomo, however, criticized the narrative structure. \\"Christopher Priest's fractured writing is getting on my nerves. Like the Spider-Man comics, I want to like Black Panther, but Priest's deliberately jumbled approach to writing is simply silly. I know it's a style, but does he have to do it every issue?\\"[125]\\r\\nReporter Bill Radford cited similar concerns when the title had just launched. \\"I appreciate the notion of seeing the Black Panther through the eyes of an Everyman, but the Panther is almost relegated to secondary status in his own book. And Ross' narration jumps around in time so much that I feel like his boss, who, in trying to get Ross to tell her what has happened, complains: 'This is like watching \\"Pulp Fiction\\" in rewind. My head is exploding.'\\"[126]\\r\\nPublishers Weekly gave a negative review to the first arc, \\"Who Is the Black Panther?\\", a modern retelling of the character's origin, saying, \\"Hudlin's take is caught between a rock and a hard place. His over-the-top narrative is not likely to appeal to fans of the most recent version of the character, but it's too mired in obscure Marvel continuity to attract the more general reader. The plot manages to be convoluted without ever becoming absorbing\\".[127]\\r\\nJournalist Shawn Jeffords, citing the lack of appearances of the title character in the first issue, called the new series a \\"fairly unimpressive launch\\". Jeffords also said general-audience unfamiliarity was a hindrance. \\"He's never been a marquee character and to make him one will be tough\\".[128]\\r\\nT'Challa is Coal Tiger, Sersi kills the Avengers and Coal Tiger is the only survivor.[129]\\r\\nIn the Age of Ultron story, Black Panther contacts the Fantastic Four and informs them that Ultron has invaded Earth with an army of Ultron Sentinels.[130] Black Panther was later seen with Red Hulk and Taskmaster in Chicago spying on some Ultron Sentinels. When Taskmaster takes out a Sentinel that was sneaking up on him, alerting the other Sentinels, Red Hulk holds off the Sentinels while Black Panther and Taskmaster flee. During the mayhem, Black Panther falls several stories and breaks his neck, killing him instantly.[131]\\r\\nBronze Tiger is the ruler of Wakanda and is named B'Nchalla; an amalgamation of the Bronze Tiger (DC) and the Black Panther (Marvel).\\r\\nIn Avengers Forever, Captain America and Goliath visit an alternate future timeline where Martian invaders have ravaged the Earth. An aged Black Panther leads this reality's version of the Avengers, who consist of Jocasta, Living Lightning, Killraven, Crimson Dynamo and Thundra.[132]\\r\\nIn an alternate reality where the Civil War between Iron Man and Captain America never ended, Black Panther was killed alongside Maria Hill after activating Prison 42's self-destruct mechanism.[133] He is succeeded by his son, Azari, who takes on the Black Panther name.[134] It is later revealed that the Black Panther who destroyed Prison 42 was actually Queen Veranke of the shape-shifting alien Skrull race, who had stolen T'Challa's identity in order to manipulate and prolong the Civil War to suit her own needs.[135]\\r\\nT'Challa is Chieftain Justice, a Captain Britain Corps member, in Excalibur #44 (1991).[136]\\r\\nIn the alternate universe of Earth X, T'Challa has been affected by the mutative event that drives the plot. Like most of humanity, he is mutated; in this case to become a humanoid black panther. He is entrusted with the Cosmic Cube by Captain America, who knows that T'Challa would be the only one to resist using it and to never give it back if asked. In fact, Captain America does ask for it back and T'Challa is forced to refuse.[137]\\r\\nAn alternate version of Black Panther, called simply \\"Panther\\", is drafted onto the interdimensional superhero team the Exiles.[138] The Panther is the son of T'Challa and Storm and named T'Chaka, after his grandfather. Originating from Earth-1119, he was ambushed by Klaw while examining some ruins. Caught in Klaw's blast, the Panther was plucked out of time and placed on the team.[138] Unlike the stoic 616-Black Panther, The Panther is a wisecracking flirt.[138] After his assumed death on Earth-1119, his sister took up the mantle of Black Panther.[139]\\r\\nThe Black Panther appears in issues #1 and #6ÿ7 of Marvel Comics/Fox Kids comic book series based on the TV show The Avengers: United They Stand.\\r\\nT'Challa appears in Marvel Mangaverse Volume 2 as a man with a pet panther. When summoning the spirits, T'Challa and his panther combine to become the Black Panther. He also became The Falcon. This Black Panther was romantically attracted to Tigra. T'Challa's sister, T'Chana, reveals herself to be this universe's Doctor Doom.[140]\\r\\nIn the Marvel 2099 continuity, a greatly weakened Wakanda is soon to be governed by its princess, Okusana. Fearing that she is not ready, she requests Doom's help in resurrecting Thandaza, her grandfather and a former Black Panther. Doom (who claims to have agreed to the proposal out of respect for T'Challa) and the Wakandan scientists revive Thandaza in a cyberbetic body made from vibranium, but the plan goes awry when Mkhalali, the current Panther Guard, opens fire on Thandaza, believing his resurrection to be an abomination. The attack throws off the calibrations and leaves Thandaza in a maddened state and constant pain, causing him to go on a bloody rampage. Doom is ultimately forced to kill Thandaza, who thanks him for ending his suffering.[141]\\r\\nBlack Panther was featured in the Marvel Knights 2099 one shots, which were not tied to the main 2099 continuity. A new Black Panther, K'Shamba, rose to fight and thwart the mounting invasions by the successor of Doom. While the victory over the new Doom appeared triumphant, the new Wakandan king was ultimately revealed to be a puppet of Doom.[142]\\r\\nBlack Panther is, for the most part, one of the few uninfected superheroes in the alternate-universe series Marvel Zombies, where he is kept as a food supply for the Zombie Giant-Man, who keeps the Panther imprisoned and cuts off various limbs so that he can maintain his intelligence via a ready access to fresh meat without infecting Panther with the zombie \\"virus\\".[143] Despite having lost half of his right arm and his left foot, the Panther escapeswith the severed head of zombified superheroine the Wasp in tow[144]and joins forces with the mutant group the Acolytes.[145] While with the Acolytes, T'Challa briefly talks with his Earth-616 counterpart, where he expresses surprise at his marriage to Storm but offers him all the information he can provide about the zombie plague.[146] Decades later, T'Challa has married one of the Acolytes, Lisa Hendricks, and they have a son, with Forge having provided T'Challa with artificial limbs to compensate for his injuries.[147] Facing retirement, the Panther is stabbed and critically wounded by an agent of an Acolyte splinter group, and the Wasp now a willing ally after having lost her zombie hunger zombifies the Panther in order to grant him continued existence. With the Wasp's help, he survives to the post-hunger stage himself and continues to lead his people, despite his status.[148] Further internal betrayal lead the Black Panther and many of his allies to be tossed through the dimensions.[149] He ends up involved with another Earth that is threatened by the zombie virus. His attempts to save this new planet fail and he is destroyed, leaving only one hand displayed as a trophy by his enemies.[150]\\r\\nIn the MC2 universe, Black Panther has a son named T'Chaka II, who joined the A-Next as the Coal Tiger.[151]\\r\\nIn the Mutant X reality, Black Panther had the appearance of a humanoid black panther. He is among the second wave of heroes who died fighting the Beyonder.[152]\\r\\nIn the alternate-reality Ultimate Marvel imprint, the Black Panther is T'Challa Udaku, a young man who is experimented on in the Weapon X program before being liberated by Nick Fury.[153]\\r\\nT'Challa, the younger son of King T'Chaka of Wakanda, is severely injured during the \\"Trial of the Panther\\" from which the protector of the nation is selected. His older brother M'Baku finds T'Challa bloodied, mute, and near death but derisively calls him a fool for attempting the trial. Later, M'Baku adds that he, not T'Challa, should have taken the trial. Angry that his father has decided to share Wakanda's technology in exchange for America's help in saving T'Challa's life, M'Baku leaves the kingdom.\\r\\nTo save T'Challa, T'Chaka turns him over to the Weapon X program. Over a year later, a healthy T'Challa, in his full Black Panther garb, has enhanced speed, strength, night vision, and healing ability. Additionally, he can summon short, cat-like Adamantium claws from his knuckles by balling his hands into fists. T'Chaka becomes outraged upon learning that S.H.I.E.L.D. (who had shut down Weapon X and freed T'Challa) now considers his son an asset of the U.S. and S.H.I.E.L.D. He subsequently sends M'Baku a letter, claiming that M'Baku, not T'Challa, is the titular \\"favorite son\\", and he implores M'Baku to return.\\r\\nFury has Captain America train and mentor the Panther, who reveals his damaged throat. Captain America, sympathizing for the Panther's plight, encourages Fury to place the Panther in the superhero team the Ultimates. This turns out to be a ruse in which Captain America impersonates the Panther, allowing T'Challa to escape and return home to Wakanda.[154]\\r\\nCaptain America later impersonates Black Panther during an Ultimates confrontation with the Juggernaut.[155]\\r\\nAfter Ultimatum, Black Panther joins the New Ultimates.[156]\\r\\nChadwick Boseman portrays T'Challa within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, first appearing in Captain America: Civil War (2016).[170][171] In the film, he is shown displaying enhanced speed, agility, strength, and durability, which he gains from ingesting the heart-shaped herb, as in the comics.[172] His suit has retractable claws and is made of a vibranium weave, which can deflect heavy machine gun fire. As of the 2018 film Black Panther, he wears a new variant of the suit that can absorb kinetic energy (represented as purple highlights) and release it as a purple shockwave after enough has been amassed. It can also fold into a silver necklace.\\r\\nIn 2016, Disney XD launched on its YouTube channel the motion comic \\"Black Panther in ... The Visitor\\".[182]","input":"When did black panther become a comic book?"},{"output":"Madden NFL 18","context":"Madden NFL (originally known as John Madden Football until 1993) is an American football video game series developed by EA Tiburon for EA Sports. It is named after Pro Football Hall of Famer John Madden, and has sold more than 100 million copies, and influenced many players and coaches of the physical sport. Among the game's realistic features are sophisticated playbooks and player statistics, and voice commentary that allows players to hear the game as if it were a real TV broadcast. As of September 2013, the franchise generated over $4 billion in revenue.[1]\\r\\nElectronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins conceived the series and approached Madden in 1984 for his endorsement and expertise. Because of Madden's insistence that the game be as realistic as possible, the first version of John Madden Football did not appear until 1988. EA has released annual versions since 1990, and the series' name changed to Madden NFL in 1993 after EA acquired the rights to use NFL teams and players. Despite Madden's retirement as a broadcaster in 2009, he continues to lend his name to and provide expertise for the game.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2013[update] Electronic Arts has sold more than 100 million copies of Madden NFL, and more than five million in one year, for more than $4 billion in total sales.[3] At EA Tiburon in Orlando, Florida a team of 30 developers and more than 100 game testers works on each new game in the series,[4] which as of 2012[update] contains more than 10 million lines of source code.[5]\\r\\nMadden, once better known for Ace Hardware commercials than football despite winning Super Bowl XI with the Oakland Raiders, is now better known for Madden NFL than as coach or broadcaster.[6][4] He receives an estimated $2 to 3 million each year for his endorsement[7] but describes himself as \\"never a good player\\" of Madden, and prefers to watch others play.[5] Although Madden says that \\"a computer is a helluva lot smarter than me\\"[2] he has influenced the series' design from the first game, and since retiring from broadcasting and doing videogame voice commentary in 2009 his participation in each Madden's development has increased:[5][4]\\r\\nHe breaks down upcoming rules changes. He brings up concussions, helmet-to-helmet hits and gimmick quarterbacks. A digression on how the Dome Patrol-era Saints used to frustrate Bill Walsh's 49ers teams with short linebacker drops becomes a lecture on the obsolescence of the fullback, which then morphs into a short aside on player character.[4]\\r\\nEA estimates that the series has five to seven million dedicated fans, and an underground circuit of Madden cash tournaments exists.[5] Marshall Faulk in 2010 estimated that \\"50 percent on up\\" of NFL players are Madden players, who play in the league with or against childhood heroes they once chose to play as in the game.[9] Players typically play as themselves regardless of their electronic counterparts' abilities[8][10][9] and immediately check new releases of the game for changes in the more than 60 ratings of their talent.[11][2] They often complain to Madden and EA about allegedly inaccurate ratings (only Emmitt Smith has told him that the game rated him too high), or ask for changes in their in-game appearance. Such complaints began as early as 1990, confusing the broadcaster, who did not contribute the player statistics for that year's version due to lack of time.[4][7]\\r\\nCoaches and players at all levels of the sport say that Madden has influenced them, and recommend the game to learn football strategy and tactics, practice plays and assignments, and simulate opponents.[4][9] Young players who grew up with it reportedly understand plays better than those who did not. Wired in 2010 attributed the growing use of rookie quarterbacks and the spread offense to the game, stating that \\"the sport is being taken over by something you might call Maddenball  a sophisticated, high-scoring, pass-happy, youth-driven phenomenon\\". When the Denver Broncos' Brandon Stokley in 2009 burned six seconds of the clock with an unusual run before scoring the winning touchdown against the Cincinnati Bengals, Madden designerswho were watching the game with Maddenimmediately recognized his action as \\"what happens in the game!\\"[9][4]\\r\\nFootball broadcasts on television use Madden-like visual cues to more closely resemble it, and the NFL considers the series its \\"33rd franchise\\" because each week during the season EA Sports receives the same searchable film database of every play that each of the league's 32 teams do.[5][2] The game is the NFL's second-largest source of licensing revenue after apparel, and an important part of the league's recruitment of children as new football fans.[8]\\r\\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2003 opened an interactive exhibit in which visitors play Madden,[11] three years before its namesake's induction.[4] Museum of the Moving Image in New York City in early 2014 celebrated Madden NFL's 25th anniversary, with an exhibit including five playable versions of the game.[12]\\r\\nVoice commentary in Madden allows players or watchers to hear the game being called as if it were a real game on TV.[13] For early versions of the game, this commentary was performed by Madden himself and his play-by-play partner. Initially, this was Pat Summerall, his partner during their days at the CBS and the Fox from the early 1980s to the early 2000s until Summerall retired; the role was then filled by Al Michaels, John's broadcast partner on ABC Monday Night Football (2002ÿ2005) and NBC Sunday Night Football (2006ÿ2008). For the first Madden games on the Xbox 360 and PS3, they featured a generic EA Sports radio announcer doing play-by-play. This started with Madden 06 and ended with Madden 08.[14] Other versions of those games still featured Madden's commentary. Madden NFL 09 would end up being the last version to feature Madden's commentary, albeit in a reduced role. By that time, he felt that reciting a script covering every single scenario in the game was boring and tedious[15]Madden recalled the long hours spent alone in the recording studio as \\"the most difficult part of any part that I've ever had in the game and the least amount of fun\\"[5]but said that in the decision to remove him from game commentary, \\"I feel that something is being taken away from me\\".[4]\\r\\nMadden and Michaels were replaced by Cris Collinsworth as color commentator and Tom Hammond on play-by-play in Madden NFL 09 and Madden NFL 10. Gus Johnson replaced Hammond in Madden NFL 11 and Madden NFL 12, with Collinsworth handling color commentary in both games.[16] Madden NFL 13 marked the debut of real-life announcing team Jim Nantz and Phil Simms, including them appearing in an in-booth cutscene before the game.[17] Nantz and Simms stayed until Madden NFL 16, when they were replaced by Brandon Gaudin and Charles Davis for Madden NFL 17. Gaudin and Davis returned to the studio throughout the 2016ÿ17 NFL season to add new commentary relevant to each week of the season.[18]\\r\\nIn a similar approach used by the automobile industry, until Madden NFL 25, the Madden series has always historically been numbered one year later than the year in which it is released. However, the season it represents is the year in which the game is released (thus, Madden NFL 13 was actually released in 2012 and is modeled after the 2012 NFL season).\\r\\nTrip Hawkins created a clone of the Strat-o-Matic paper and dice-based football simulation game as a teenager. The game was unsuccessful due to its complexity, and he hoped to one day delegate its rules to a computer. At Harvard College, where Hawkins played football for the Crimson, he wrote a football simulation for the PDP-11 minicomputer which, he later said, predicted that the Miami Dolphins would defeat the Minnesota Vikings 23ÿ6 (actually 24ÿ7) in the 1974 Super Bowl.[4][24] After founding Electronic Arts in 1982[4]\\"The real reason that I founded [it] was because I wanted to make computerized versions of games like Strat-O-Matic\\", Hawkins later said[23][9]the company began designing a microcomputer football game. Hawkins first approached his favorite player Joe Montana to endorse the proposed game but the quarterback already had an endorsement deal with Atari Inc., and his second choice, Cal coach Joe Kapp, demanded royalties.[4]\\r\\nIn 1984 Hawkins approached Madden. He and game producer Joe Ybarra arranged a follow-up meeting with the broadcaster during an Amtrak train trip over two days because of Madden's fear of flying.[4][25][26][5] The EA executives promised that the proposed game would be a sophisticated football simulation, and asked the retired Oakland Raiders coach for his endorsement and expertise. Madden knew nothing about computers beyond his telestrator but agreed; he had taught a class at the University of California, Berkeley called \\"Football for Fans\\", and envisioned the program as a tool for teaching and testing plays.[4][15] (Madden continues to see the game as an educational tool. When asked in 2012 to describe Madden NFL, he called it \\"a way for people to learn the game and participate in the game at a pretty sophisticated level\\".[5]) Hawkins and Ybarra during the train trip learned football plays and strategies from Madden from sunrise to midnight.[4]\\r\\nEA likely expected Madden to endorse the game without participating in its design. Early plans envisioned six or seven players per team because of technical limitations but Madden insisted on having 11 players,[4][5] stating \\"I'm not putting my name on it if it's not real.\\"[26] Ybarra, who had played chess, not football, in high school, became an expert on the subject through his work, but found that 11 players overwhelmed contemporary home computers. Most projects that are as delayed as Madden are canceled; Ybarra and developer Robin Antonick needed three years, more than twice the length of the average development process. The project became known within the company as \\"Trip's Folly\\", and Madden believed at times that EA had given up.[4]\\r\\nThe company hired Bethesda Softworks to finish the game, but this only got them partway to their goal. While EA used many of its designs, including contributions to their physics engine,[27] within a year Bethesda stopped working on Madden and sued EA over EA's failure to publish new versions of Bethesda's Gridiron! football game. This added to the delay.[26] After a final development push, John Madden Football debuted in 1988 for the Apple II series of computers. Hawkins and an exhausted Ybarra (\\"All my memories are of pain\\") were able to move on to other projects.[4]\\r\\nEA had a copy of the 1980 Raiders playbook, and hired San Francisco Chronicle writer Frank Cooney, who had designed his own figurine football game with numerical skill ratings. Although the company could not yet legally use NFL teams' or players' names, Cooney obtained real plays from NFL teams. The back of the box called the game \\"The First Real Football Simulation\\" and quoted Madden: \\"Hey, if there aren't 11 players, it isn't real football.\\" Documentation included diagrams of dozens of offensive and defensive plays with Madden's commentary on coaching strategies and philosophy.[28] The game sold moderately well[4] but given the sophisticated playbook its interface was complex, and Madden's insistence on 11 players caused the game to run slowly.[26]\\r\\nDuring this period, Madden turned down the opportunity to buy an \\"unlimited\\" number of options for EA stock in its initial public offering, a decision he later called \\"the dumbest thing I ever did in my life\\".[4][5]\\r\\nIn early 1990 EA hired Park Place Productions to develop Madden for the Sega Genesis video game console. Park Place had developed ABC Monday Night Football with \\"arcade-style, action-heavy\\" game play, and its Madden also emphasized hyperreality compared to the computer version's focus on exact simulation.[4][6] Impressed with Park Place's work, EA chose it for the Genesis Madden instead of completing an in-house version by Antonick.[29]\\r\\nEA reverse engineered the console to sell the game without paying the standard $8 to $10 license fee per cartridge to Sega, then proposed a compromise of $2 per cartridge and a $2 million cap on the fee. The console maker agreed, afraid that EA would sell its reverse-engineered knowledge to other companies; the agreement saved EA $35 million over the next three years. As its own Joe Montana-endorsed football game would miss the 1990 Christmas shopping season, Sega asked EA to let it sell Madden with the Montana name. EA refused, but offered an inferior alternative that lacked Madden's 3D graphics and most of its 113 plays.[4][6] Joe Montana Football sold well despite shipping after Christmas 1990, and remained popular after BlueSky Software took over development.[26] John Madden Football for the Genesis, however, became both the first hugely successful Madden gameselling 400,000 copies when the company expected 75,000[29]and the first killer app for EA and Sega, helping the console gain market share against the Super NES.[4][26] From 1992 to 1994, Mega placed the game at #1 in their monthly Top 100 Mega Drive Games of All Time.\\r\\nIn 1990, EA producer Richard Hilleman brought in veteran sports game designer Scott Orr, who had founded the mid-1980s Commodore 64 game publisher GameStar, and had led the design of their best-selling sports games. The team of Orr and Hilleman designed and led the development of what is today still recognizable as the modern Madden. Early versions of Madden were created by external development studios such as Bethesda, Visual Concepts, and Stormfront Studios. John Madden Football '92 also featured the ambulance which would run over any players in its path. After Visual Concepts failed to deliver Madden NFL '96 for the new PlayStation in 1995, EA hired Tiburon Entertainment for Madden NFL '97[26] and later acquired the company, centralizing development in-house.[4] It planned to release John Madden Football as its first sports-based arcade game, but the game was cancelled due to unenthusiastic reactions from play testers.[30] EA's refusal to release Madden and other sports titles for the Dreamcast in 1999 contributed to the console's lack of success and Sega's exit from the hardware market.[26]\\r\\nIn 1998 Electronic Arts added \\"Franchise Mode\\" to Madden, giving players the ability to play multiple seasons, make off-season draft picks, and trade players.[31] Within Franchise Mode, players take on the role of General Manager and manage all personnel matters, including contracts, free agency, draft picks, and hiring and firing coaches. The player also acts as a head coach-like character (although there is a head coach figure in-game), choosing which players to play, making substitutions, running practices, practicing gameplans, etc.\\r\\nPlayers may play with any of the NFL's 32 franchises, and can choose whether or not to have trade deadlines, salary caps, and if they want to start their Franchise with a 49-round fantasy draft of all active NFL players. Players can also upload created teams for use in the game.\\r\\nOnce in game, players run training camp (individual drills for improving players' attributes), play in preseason games and compete in a regular 16-game NFL season, including playoffs and the Super Bowl. The player has the option to play any game in the simulation, including those involving other teams if they so desire, or may simulate through the games as they choose. Most versions of Madden give a player 30 years with their franchise, sometimes with an opportunity to apply for the Hall of Fame at the end of the simulation.\\r\\nMadden NFL 2001 featured a segment called \\"Great Games\\" where one would be put in a situation where they control one team and would have to win the game with a set amount of time. If the player wins, they unlock either a new team or a stadium. Overall, there were more than 60 teams and over 80 stadiums in Madden NFL 2001.\\r\\nMadden NFL 2002 featured for the first time Create-A-Team where one would make a team and play with that team in either Play Now or Franchise mode. It also featured Create-A-League mode but it never caught on. Create-A-Team was not featured in Madden NFL 13 and moving teams was first featured in Madden NFL 2004 called \\"Stadium\\" in the Franchise mode of the game. Madden NFL 2002 was the 2nd highest selling game in 2002.\\r\\nThere are multiple modes of game play, from a quick head-to-head game to running a team for a whole season or even multiple seasons. Online play, which was a new feature for Madden NFL 2003 (in this version there are also mini-camp challenges) was only available for users of the PlayStation 2 console, Xbox console, or a Microsoft Windows PC until early 2004.\\r\\nAlso, starting with Madden NFL 2004, EA Sports created the new Playmaker tool, using the right analog joystick found on each of the adjustments previously unavailable in prior installments of the franchise.[32] One such adjustment includes the ability to switch which direction a running play was going without changing the formation. Prior to the Playmaker tool, the Player could only call one of four available \\"hot routes.\\" With Playmaker and the use of the right thumb stick, the player is given 4 additional Hot Route options. When the quarterback has the ball the Playmaker Tool can be used to make receivers alter their routes mid-play. When running the ball on offense, the runner can control the direction in which the blocker is going. Defensive alignment adjustments, however, were not available leading to obvious imbalance in favor of the Offensive player.\\r\\nIn Madden NFL 2005, EA Sports ran a campaign with the Theme \\"Fear the D\\" emphasising their improvements on the \\"other side of the ball.\\" In an attempt to re-balance the players experience, EA gave a Playmaker Tool to the defense. Similar to the offensive Playmaker Tool, the defensive Playmaker allows the player to make pre-snap defensive adjustments. EA Sports further utilized the right analog joystick on defense by creating the \\"Hit Stick\\", an option on defense that allows the controlled player to make big hits, with a simple flick, that increases the chances the ball carrier will fumble. Also introduced for the first time is the \\"Formation Shift.\\" This new feature allowed players to shift their formation in the pre-snap audible menu without actually changing the play. For example, if you call a run play up the middle out of a goal line formation, you could then call a formation shift and make your players spread out into a four wide receiver formation while still in the same running play. The problem with this new function was that EA also added a fatigue penalty for the defense causing defensive players to get more tired each time there was a formation shift. This led to players on offense calling multiple formation shifts each play making the defensive players too exhausted to keep up and force them to substitute out of the game until they are fully rested. This led to more imbalance that could only be fixed by turning off fatigue.\\r\\n2005 also added \\"EA Sports Radio\\", a fictional show that plays during the menu screen of Franchise mode to provide a greater sense of a storyline during gameplay. It features Tony Bruno as the host, who often interviews players and coaches about how the season is going and also has quiz questions in which fake listeners call in to make attempts at answering football-related questions. It included mock interviews of famous NFL players and coaches throughout the in-game season. Some fans have criticized EA Sports for not including new features to the 'programming' as the radio became stale after only two seasons in franchise mode, but the feature drew acclaim for adding content to the Franchise menu. Also added was the Newspaper where the player could look at National News from licensed USA Today and Licensed Local papers for almost each of the 32 NFL teams. Lastly, 2005 also saw the introduction of multiple progressions during franchise mode. Previously NFL players in Madden would only progress or regress at the end of each season. Now at the end of Week 5, 11, and 17 the game would use a program to \\"progress\\" players based on their performance in addition to end of season progression.\\r\\nIn Madden NFL 06, the \\"Truck Stick\\" was introduced. This feature allows the offensive player to lower his shoulder and break a tackle, or back juke to avoid one. Another new feature is the Superstar Mode, which allows the player to take control of a rookie, and progress through his career.[33] This includes an IQ test, interviews, workouts, the NFL Draft, hiring an agent, and other aspects of a superstar's life.\\r\\nEA also introduced the QB Vision feature in the 2006 installment. With this feature, a cone of spotlight emits from the quarterback during passing plays, simulating his field of vision. To make an accurate pass, the quarterback must have his intended receiver in his field of vision. Passing to a receiver not in the cone reduces pass accuracy significantly. The size of the quarterback's vision cone is directly correlated to his Awareness and Passer Accuracy rating; Brett Favre and Peyton Manning see nearly the entire field at once, whereas an inexperienced quarterback such as J. P. Losman or Kyle Boller sees only a sliver of the field.[4] This feature also allows for bigger plays and more interceptions.\\r\\nAlso, EA sports added the Smart Route. This means that when pressing a hot route to the corresponding receiver, you put the analog stick down and the receiver will run to the first down, and you can throw him the ball.\\r\\nWhile current gen Madden remained the same with the exception of a \\"Smart Route\\" and \\"QB Vision\\", this was also the first year Madden was released on the next-gen Xbox 360. It was completely stripped down, almost every change made in the previous gen was wiped away.\\r\\nIn Madden NFL 07, EA introduced Lead Blocker Controls which allow users to control blockers during running plays. In addition, EA redefined the Truck Stick into the Highlight Stick. With the Highlight Stick, users can have their running backs perform different running moves and combos, instead of just bowling over defenders. Truck Stick features still exist for bigger backs, but not for smaller backs who would never realistically use them anyway. Instead, more agile backs perform acrobatic ducks and dodges to avoid tackles.[34]\\r\\nIn Madden NFL 08, the Weapons feature was added, allowing superstar players to be noticed. Randy Moss, for example, is a Go-To-Guy, allowing him to make amazing one-handed grabs. Peyton Manning is a Franchise QB. It also includes new skill drills, Hit Stick 2.0, and Ring of a Champion features. Tennessee Titans quarterback Vince Young is on the cover. Madden NFL 08 was also the last GameCube game ever released. 2008 marked the last year of the PC version of the game.\\r\\nMadden NFL 09 was released on August 12, 2008. Citing business concerns, EA chose not to release it on the PC platform.[35] The game features quarterback Brett Favre on the front cover.[36] Madden NFL 09 was the first of the series to offer online, league game play, allowing up to 32 players to compete in an online, simulated NFL season. EA Sports Senior Producer Phil Frazier, up to 32 players were able to participate in competitive games, the NFL Draft and conduct trades between their teams. The game was also the first of the series to incorporate a Madden IQ. The Madden IQ is used to automatically gauge your skills through a series of mini-games consisting of run offense, pass offense, run defense, and pass defense. At the end of each of the drills, the player receives a score ranging from rookie to all-Madden. The final Madden IQ is a mixture of those scores which is used to control the game's difficulty.[4][37][38]\\r\\nMadden NFL 10 was released on August 14, 2009.[39] Compared to previous iterations, Madden NFL 10 has been extremely transparent with its development efforts, maintaining a weekly blog updates as well as a constant presence on various message boards. A new design team has also taken over the game, including members from NFL Head Coach 09. The direction of Madden NFL 10 has been shifted to much more of a realistic and simulation focus, with info already released including Procedural Awareness (a robust head tracking system), a new philosophy on player ratings, and big improvements to realism in QB play, WR/DB play, and other areas across the game. Madden 10 has several new features including the PRO-TAK animation technology, which allows up to nine man gang tackles and fumble pile-ups to help players 'fight for every yard', in this year's tagline. Madden 10 also features an in-game weekly recap show called The Extra Point. Madden 10 offers a series of multiple play packages. This allows for more options to score. This version features a completely overhauled rating system for players, featuring new categories such as throw on the run and specific ratings for short, medium, and deep passes.[40] The game's soundtrack features rap, alternative rock, rap metal and hard rock bands such as Nirvana, Pantera, System of a Down, and Kid Rock.\\r\\nMadden NFL 11 was released on July 27, 2010 (moved up from its original release date of August 10, 2010 for promotional reasons[41]), and features Drew Brees on the cover. It features several new additions to the franchise, such as Online Team Play,[42] Online Scouting[43] and online attribute boosts for co-op play.[44] Along with these new game additions is a new rating (sponsored by Old Spice) known as Swagger.[45] Although early speculation was that this new rating would be reflective of \\"confidence\\" or \\"composure,\\" it was quickly confirmed to be directly tied to a player's personality for celebrations.[46]\\r\\nMadden NFL 12 was released on August 25, 2011. The release was delayed by two weeks due to the NFL lockout,[47] and features Cleveland Browns running back Peyton Hillis on the cover. However, there is a limited edition in which the cover features St. Louis Rams running back Marshall Faulk.\\r\\nMadden NFL 13 was released on August 28, 2012, and features Detroit Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson as the cover athlete. Madden NFL 13 is the first Madden game to be released on the PlayStation Vita, and is also the first game in the series to have Kinect support as well as a new physics engine promoting real in game physics.[48]\\r\\nMadden NFL 13 included a complete revamp to online franchise mode which became known as Connected Careers Mode (CCM). Some of the new CCM features included player contracts, the ability to trade draft picks, a salary cap, and up to 30 seasons worth of gameplay.[49]\\r\\nIn early 2013, EA Sports announced that the next installment of the Madden series was released on August 27, 2013. As this installment is the 25th anniversary of the series,[50] the game is called Madden NFL 25, instead of Madden NFL 14 with the year like the previous versions.[51] The cover vote consisted of two brackets containing past players (\\"Old School\\") and active players (\\"New School\\").[52]\\r\\n\\"Old School\\" player and Pro Football Hall of Famer Barry Sanders was chosen as the cover athlete for Madden NFL 25 on the April 24, 2013, episode of ESPN's SportsNation. The \\"New School\\" finalist was Adrian Peterson.[53]\\r\\nOn March 13, 2014 EA Sports posted on its website that user would be able to design and submit uniforms for Connected Careers by March 17, 2014 for \\"the next Madden NFL.\\"[54] On April 28, 2014, EA announced the release of Madden 15 pre-ordering in a release video with NFL linebacker and 2013 Defensive Player of the Year Luke Kuechly. The game was released August 26 in North America and on August 29 in the EU for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. The game featured \\"dramatic all-new camera angles, as well as dynamic pre-game and halftime features.\\"[55] During the Detroit Lions 10th pick of the 2014 NFL Draft, Barry Sanders announced fans again would be able to vote for the cover athlete.[56] On June 6, Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman was announced as the cover athlete.[57]\\r\\nEA decided not to have players vote for the cover athlete through a traditional bracket, but rather through collectible cards in Madden NFL Mobile, or through Ultimate Team on the console devices. On May 4, 2015, the four finalists were announced for the 2016 game cover: New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, Arizona Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson, New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown. On May 13, Beckham Jr. beat out Gronkowski in a fan vote for the cover of Madden 16. It was released on August 25, 2015.[58]\\r\\nMadden NFL 17 was released on August 23, 2016. The features in the game include an upgrade of the Ground Game, a redesigned and better Franchise Mode, \\"Madden 365\\", new Ball Carrier UI Prompts, the new Path Assist and more.[59] New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski serves as the cover athlete.[60]\\r\\nMadden NFL 18 was released on August 25, 2017.[61] The game is the first in the series to be developed in the Frostbite Engine, and incorporates a Story Mode, akin to The Journey in FIFA 17.[62] It was announced that Tom Brady would be on the cover, marking the second consecutive year where a Patriot will be on the cover.[63] Furthermore, an enhanced G.O.A.T edition was also announced.[64]\\r\\nUntil 1993, the Madden series did not have official licenses from the National Football League or National Football League Players Association (NFLPA). Madden NFL '94 was the first game in the series to include real NFL teams, and Madden NFL '95 added an NFLPA license for real players through the National Football League Players Incorporated (NFLPI).[65] The licenses restrict EA from including certain content in current Madden games, such as the humorous ambulance that picks up injured players in 1991's John Madden Football II.[4] The NFL Coaches Association sold the rights to have NFL coaches' names appear in the Madden NFL games; Madden NFL 2001 was the first game in the series to feature this license.[66] Neither New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick nor Bill Parcells appeared in the game as they are not members of the NFL Coaches Association. Likewise, non-NFLPA players (such as Thurman Thomas during his playing career) do not appear in the game, instead being replaced with generic placeholders.\\r\\nIn 2004, EA signed an exclusive license through 2009 with the NFL and the NFLPI to give the company the exclusive rights to use the NFL's teams, stadia, and players in a video game.[67] This exclusive license prevents other official NFL video games. The deal, reportedly worth $300 million and later extended to 2013,[4] has been widely criticized. Some competitors, such as the Blitz: The League series, have elected to continue, seeking to distinguish themselves through innovative gameplay while others, such as the NFL 2K series, have ceased production. In 2007, 2K Sports released All Pro Football 2K8, which used former NFL stars.\\r\\nIn August 2006, EA Sports debuted NFL Head Coach, which utilized the Madden engine to create a football management simulation. The game was criticized as buggy and unrealistic. EA Tiburon rebuilt the game from the ground up, addressing flaws and creating a proprietary engine, over the course of three years. NFL Head Coach 09 was released on August 12, 2008 bundled with the special edition of Madden NFL 09 and as a standalone game on September 2, 2008.\\r\\nReleased on November 24, 2009,[68] the game is 5-on-5 and takes the best 10 players from each of the 32 NFL teams.[69]\\r\\nMadden NFL Football was released as the launch title for the Nintendo 3DS on March 27, 2011.[70]\\r\\nIn 1996, Next Generation listed the Genesis installments of the series collectively as number 30 on their \\"Top 100 Games of All Time\\", calling them \\"One of the best two-player games of all time, the game that reinvented EA, and (along with Sonic the Hedgehog) the game that launched Sega's 16-bit assault on Nintendo.\\"[71]\\r\\nPrior to 1999, every annual installment of the Madden NFL series primarily featured Madden on its cover.[4][72] In 1999, Electronic Arts selected Garrison Hearst to appear on the PAL version's cover, and has since featured one of the leagues top players on every annual installment[73] despite Madden's opposition.[4] While appearing on the cover has become an honor akin to appearing on the Wheaties box,[4] much like the Sports Illustrated Cover Jinx, certain players who appeared on Madden video game box art have experienced a decline in performance, usually due to an injury. This apparent run of misfortune for Madden cover athletes has been dubbed the \\"Madden Curse.\\"[74]\\r\\nWhen asked about the Madden Curse, EA Sports' Chris Erb said, \\"I don't know that we believe in the curse. The players don't believe in the curse.\\"[75] Running back Shaun Alexander, who was featured on the cover of Madden NFL 07, commented \\"Do you want to be hurt and on the cover, or just hurt?\\" Madden NFL 08 cover athlete Vince Young expressed skepticism,[76][77] while Madden NFL 12 cover athlete Peyton Hillis attributed his subpar season that year to the curse.[78]\\r\\nThe perception that the curse is real has resulted in some fans lobbying for their favorite players not to be on the cover, such as fans of LaDainian Tomlinson who were strongly opposed to EA Sports' initial decision to feature him on the cover of Madden NFL 08, so much that a fan created SaveLTfromMadden.com to voice their disdain.[79][80][81] Tomlinson eventually declined the offer, but stated it was solely due to contract negotiations.[81] Starting with Madden NFL 11 EA has allowed fans to choose their favorite player for the cover.[82] However, EA believes that many fans vote against their favorite player to avoid the purported \\"curse\\".[5] It has become so prominent that bookmakers create odds on how likely an injury will occur to the player appearing on the cover.[83]\\r\\nThe injuries that Madden cover athletes experience can be attributed to the physical nature of football.[75] Also to earn the honor of being put on the game cover, a player is usually coming off of a strong year and some regression the following year is likely. Attributing some cause, such as a curse, to this randomness is a regression fallacy and a spurious correlation.\\r\\nIn December 2010, EA announced plans on developing a movie based on the Curse, which would be a comedy, and not based on fate-based horror movies like Final Destination.[84] However, EA Entertainment executive Pat O'Brien stated in October 2014 that EA is not working on a Madden Curse movie.[85]\\r\\nThe Madden Bowl is a single elimination tournament held on the most current edition of Madden NFL. It has been held since 1995 during Super Bowl weekend in the host city and, in the past, participation included NFL players and celebrities. The Madden Bowl's participation has changed over the years from being an event held with athletes, musicians, and celebrities, to become an event where only NFL players who are invited to participate get a chance to play. Participants in the Madden Bowl are free to choose whichever team they like. Winners receive a Madden Bowl trophy and recognition in the upcoming Madden video game.\\r\\nThe 2006 Madden Bowl, held during the weekend of Super Bowl XL in Detroit, Michigan, was televised on ESPN and premiered in April 2006. It is not to be confused with Madden Nation, which was a reality television show that chronicled a cross-country trip to crown the best Madden player in America, which also aired on ESPN.\\r\\nFrom 2011 to 2012, the Madden Bowl competition utilizes the new Online Team Play feature included in Madden NFL 11. Rather than competing as individuals, players form groups of three to square-off for the trophy. After this feature was discontinued, the Madden Bowl competition continued in a Head-to-Head format.\\r\\nSince 2004, EA Sports has run a simulation of the Super Bowl using the latest game in the Madden NFL series and announced the result. The game simulations conducted by EA have correctly predicted ten of the last 14 Super Bowl winners.

The eight lane bridge satisfied the capacity of U.S. Route 17 when it opened in 2005 to replace two obsolete cantilever truss bridges. The bridge has a main span of 1,546 feet (471 m), the third longest among cable-stayed bridges in the Western Hemisphere. It was built using the design-build method and was designed by Parsons Brinckerhoff.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first bridge to cross the lower Cooper River opened in 1929, eventually named the John P. Grace Memorial Bridge for former Charleston mayor John P. Grace, who spearheaded the project. The main span of the double cantilever truss bridge was the fifth longest in the world at 1,050 feet (320 m) and soared 150 feet (46 m) above the river. The main span of the second cantilever was the twelfth-longest in the world. The total length of the structure was about 2.7 miles (4.3?km). Following a 17-month construction at a cost of $6 million, it opened with a 3-day celebration that attracted visitors from around the globe. Engineers and critics proclaimed colorful descriptions of the unique structure, deeming it \\"the first roller-coaster bridge\\" and citing that \\"steep approaches, stupendous height, extremely narrow width, and a sharp curve at the dip conspire to excite and alarm the motorist.\\" Privately owned originally, a $1.00 toll was charged for car and driver to cross. In 1943 the state of South Carolina purchased the bridge, and the tolls were lifted in 1946.\\r\\nBy the 1960s the Grace Memorial Bridge had become insufficient, with its two narrow 10-foot (3 m) lanes built for Ford Model As and its steep grades of up to 6 percent. Later changes to the side rail and curb reduced the lane width further.[citation needed] A new bridge was constructed alongside and parallel to it. Named for the then-South Carolina Highway Commissioner, the Silas N. Pearman Bridge opened in 1966 at cost of $15 million. Its three lanes, at a modern 12-foot (3.7 m) width, opened to northbound traffic while its older counterpart carried the southbound traffic into downtown Charleston. One lane was reversible on the Pearman bridge, which led to signs warning \\"Use lanes with green arrow\\" and \\"Do not use red X lane\\" on the bridge.\\r\\nThe two truss bridges had become functionally obsolete by 1979. Extensive metal deterioration caused by the lack of maintenance shortly after Grace Bridge's tolls were removed limited the capacity of the older Grace bridge to ten ton vehicles (later five tons), and the reversible lane on the Pearman was eliminated (it had been able to switch to three lanes northbound for rush hour traffic), making that lane southbound permanently, diverting all heavy trucks, buses, and recreational vehicles to that lane on the Pearman bridge. Neither of the bridges had emergency lanes, and the Pearman bridge had no median between the northbound and southbound lanes because of its reversible lane, and it was not until 2002 when flexible barriers were added to the Pearman bridge to prevent head-on collisions.\\r\\nFurthermore, the vertical clearance above the river ÿ once among the highest in the world ÿ could no longer accommodate modern shipping vessels. Three of Charlestons four shipping terminals are situated up the Cooper and Wando Rivers, and the limited bridge clearance excluded the access of ships that would otherwise be beneficial to the economy of South Carolina. Now that the old bridges are disassembled, the worlds largest modern container ships are able to access all terminals of the nation's fourth-largest container port.\\r\\nRaising financial support for a new eight-lane bridge over the Cooper River was a struggle 20 years in the making, prolonged by the state's insistence that it could not afford such a bridge and by Charleston's reluctance to provide any funds for the project. Several proposals were made for a toll bridge, but the mayors of Charleston and Mount Pleasant objected. When officials revealed in 1995 that the Grace Bridge scored a 4 out of 100 for safety and integrity, retired U.S. Congressman Arthur Ravenel, Jr. ran for the South Carolina Senate with a goal of solving the funding problem. He helped to establish the S.C. Infrastructure Bank and worked with local, state, and federal officials to create partnerships that helped to materialize the final funding.\\r\\nThe State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) budgeted $325 million to accompany $96.6 million from the Federal Highway Administration. The project did not become a reality, however, until the SIB agreed to commit to a $215 million federal loan, provided that Charleston County would contribute $3 million a year for 25 years, including an 8.33% sales tax increase, to the federal loan, as well as yearly payments from the SCDOT and State Ports Authority. The overall price of the bridge totaled around $700 million.\\r\\nCharlestons new bridge over the Cooper River is a cable-stayed suspension design with two diamond-shaped towers, each 575 feet (175 m) high. The total length of the structure is 13,200 feet (4.0?km), with the main span stretching 1,546 feet (471 m) between the towers. 128 individual cables anchored to the inside of the diamond towers suspend the deck 186 feet (57 m) above the river. The roadway consists of eight 12-foot (3.7 m) lanes, four in each direction as well as a 12-foot (3.7?m) bicycle and pedestrian path to the design, which runs along the south edge of the bridge overlooking Charleston Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean.\\r\\nThe bridge superstructure is designed to withstand shipping accidents and the natural disasters that have plagued Charlestons history. The span is designed to endure wind gusts in excess of 300?mph (480?km/h), far stronger than those of the worst storm in Charleston's history, Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Engineers also considered the 1886 earthquake that nearly leveled Charleston. The Ravenel Bridge is designed to withstand an earthquake of approximately 7.4 on the Richter magnitude scale without total failure. To protect the bridge from errant ships, the towers are flanked by one-acre rock islands. Ships will run aground on the islands before colliding with the towers.\\r\\nThe bridge includes a shared bicycle-pedestrian path named Wonders' Way in memory of Garrett Wonders. Wonders was a US Navy ensign stationed in Charleston and was in training for the 2004 Olympics before he died in a bicycle-vehicle collision.[3] The path was included in design of the new bridge because of grassroots efforts by groups such as a fifth grade class at a local elementary school.[4]\\r\\nGroundbreaking on the bridge occurred in 2001 in Mount Pleasant. The bridge was built as a design-build project, meaning that one contract was signed to both design and construct the bridge. This meant that construction could begin even while the design was not yet finalized. The bridge was built by a joint venture of two major construction firms operating under the name Palmetto Bridge Constructors. The joint venture partners were Tidewater Skanska of Norfolk, Virginia and Flatiron Constructors of Longmont, Colorado. The construction joint venture hired Parsons Brinckerhoff to complete the design. For the sake of simplifying labor and equipment resources, Palmetto Bridge Constructors actually managed the building of the bridge as five separate projects (the two highway interchanges at either end of the bridge, the two approach spans, and the cable-stayed span) going on simultaneously.\\r\\nBy the summer of 2002 the foundations for the towers and most of the piers were in place and the rock islands were completed. The steel and concrete towers began to ascend from the islands soon after. Originally, each of the towers was to be topped with a 50-foot (15?m) multicolored LED \\"beacon,\\" but public opinion caused this plan to be scrapped.\\r\\nThe fast-paced construction schedule led to contractors to use a self-climbing form system to build the towers. The formwork, supplied by PERI, provided a solution to meet the tight construction tolerances and provide safe access for workers laboring hundreds of feet in the air. The self-climbing system meant that the tower cranes did not have to spend time raising the forms after each segment of concrete hardened, and instead could be better used to haul material from barges below.[5]\\r\\nThe first cables were hung from the towers in 2004as a time-saving measure, this was done before the towers were wholly completed. Sections of the deck were built outward from each of the towers as more cables were hung.\\r\\nThe decks of the approaches were taking shape as well. Construction of part of the roadway actually occurred over the top of the old cantilever bridges, which remained open to traffic without interruption.\\r\\nA ceremony was held in March 2005, when the last slab of the deck was added, thus making the bridge \\"complete.\\" But paving, installation of lights and signs, and cleanup meant that the bridge would not open for another four months.\\r\\nFollowing a week-long celebration that included a public bridge walk, concerts, dinners, and fireworks, the bridge was dedicated and opened on July 16, 2005 ÿ one year ahead of schedule and under budget. The bridge was featured on the TV show Extreme Engineering.\\r\\nThe proximity and rivalry between Charleston, South Carolina and Savannah and Brunswick often lead to comparisons between the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, the Sidney Lanier Bridge, and the Talmadge Memorial Bridge, all of which carry US 17.[citation needed] Completed in 2005, the clearance under the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is actually only 1 foot (0.30?m) taller than both the Sidney Lanier Bridge and the Talmadge Memorial Bridge. Unlike the Sidney Lanier Bridge and the Talmadge Memorial Bridge, however, the Ravenel Bridge has eight travel lanes; the Talmadge and the Sidney Lanier both have just four lanes. The Ravenel also features a dedicated bike/pedestrian lane. The Talmadge Memorial Bridge also has a similar design as the Alex Fraser Bridge in Vancouver, Canada.\\r\\nAs for the span of the three bridges, The Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is 1,546 feet (471?m). The Sidney Lanier Bridge is 1,250 feet (380?m). The Talmadge Memorial Bridge is 1,100 feet (340?m).\\r\\nAs for the total length of the three bridges, the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is 13,200 feet (4.0?km). The Sidney Lanier Bridge is 7,779 feet (2,371?m). The Talmadge Memorial Bridge is 10,032 feet (3.058?km), or 1.9 miles (3.1?km).\\r\\nThe bridge is home to the annual USA Track & Field 10,000 meter (6.2?mi) Cooper River Bridge Run on the first weekend of April. This event attracts up to 50,000 people. The route starts in Mount Pleasant and finishes in downtown Charleston at Marion Square.\\r\\nThe cover of Darius Rucker's 2010 album Charleston, SC 1966 features a picture of Rucker, a Charleston native, with the Ravenel Bridge in the background.\\r\\nThe 2014 television series Reckless features the bridge in its title sequence.\\r\\nIn the video game Need for Speed Undercover a bridge similar to the Ravenel Bridge was featured but only on the PlayStation 3, Xbox and PC versions. It was also featured in the 2012 version of Need for Speed Most Wanted (but it only crosses half of the water)\\r\\nThe 2009 movie The New Daughter, starring Kevin Costner, features the Ravenel Bridge in several scenes as the movie is based in and around Charleston, South Carolina.","input":"What is the length of the ravenel bridge?"},{"output":"Expressionism","context":"Die Brcke (The Bridge) was a group of German expressionist artists formed in Dresden in 1905, after which the Brcke Museum in Berlin was named. Founding members were Fritz Bleyl, Erich Heckel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. Later members were Emil Nolde, Max Pechstein and Otto Mueller. The seminal group had a major impact on the evolution of modern art in the 20th century and the creation of expressionism.[1]\\r\\nDie Brcke is sometimes compared to the Fauves. Both movements shared interests in primitivist art. Both shared an interest in the expressing of extreme emotion through high-keyed color that was very often non-naturalistic. Both movements employed a drawing technique that was crude, and both groups shared an antipathy to complete abstraction. The Die Brcke artists' emotionally agitated paintings of city streets and sexually charged events transpiring in country settings make their French counterparts, the Fauves, seem tame by comparison.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe founding members of Die Brcke in 1905 were four Jugendstil architecture students: Fritz Bleyl (1880ÿ1966), Erich Heckel (1883ÿ1970), Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880ÿ1938) and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff (1884ÿ1976). They met through the K?nigliche Technische Hochschule (technical university) of Dresden, where Kirchner and Bleyl began studying in 1901 and became close friends in their first term.[3] They discussed art together and also studied nature,[3] having a radical outlook in common.[4] Kirchner continued studies in Munich 1903ÿ1904, returning to Dresden in 1905 to complete his degree.[5] The institution provided a wide range of studies in addition to architecture, such as freehand drawing, perspective drawing and the historical study of art.[6] The name \\"Die Brcke\\" was intended to \\"symbolize the link, or bridge, they would form with art of the future\\".[7]\\r\\nDie Brcke aimed to eschew the prevalent traditional academic style and find a new mode of artistic expression, which would form a bridge (hence the name) between the past and the present.[4] They responded both to past artists such as Albrecht Drer, Matthias Grnewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder, as well as contemporary international avant-garde movements.[4] The group published a broadside called Programme in 1906, where Kirchner wrote:\\r\\nWe call all young people together, and as young people, who carry the future in us, we want to wrest freedom for our actions and our lives from the older, comfortably established forces.[7]\\r\\nAs part of the affirmation of their national heritage, they revived older media, particularly woodcut prints.[4] The group developed a common style based on vivid color, emotional tension, violent imagery, and an influence from primitivism. After first concentrating exclusively on urban subject matter, the group ventured into southern Germany on expeditions arranged by Mueller and produced more nudes and arcadian images. They invented the printmaking technique of linocut, although they at first described them as traditional woodcuts, which they also made.[8]\\r\\nThe group members initially \\"isolated\\" themselves in a working-class neighborhood of Dresden, aiming thereby to reject their own bourgeois backgrounds. Erich Heckel was able to obtain an empty butcher's shop on the Berlinerstrasse in Friedrichstadt for their use as a studio.[9] Bleyl described the studio as:\\r\\nKirchner's became a venue which overthrew social conventions to allow casual love-making and frequent nudity.[4] Group life-drawing sessions took place using models from the social circle, rather than professionals, and choosing quarter-hour poses to encourage spontaneity.[4] Bleyl described one such model, Isabella, a fifteen-year-old girl from the neighbourhood, as \\"a very lively, beautifully built, joyous individual, without any deformation caused by the silly fashion of the corset and completely suitable to our artistic demands, especially in the blossoming condition of her girlish buds.\\"[10]\\r\\nThe group composed a manifesto (mostly Kirchner's work), which was carved on wood and asserted a new generation, \\"who want freedom in our work and in our lives, independence from older, established forces.\\"[4]\\r\\nIn September and October 1906, the first group exhibition was held, focused on the female nude, in the showroom of K.F.M. Seifert and Co. in Dresden.[10]\\r\\nEmil Nolde (1867ÿ1956) and Max Pechstein (1881ÿ1955) joined the group in 1906. Bleyl married in 1907, and, with a concern to support his family, left the group.[3] Otto Mueller (1874ÿ1930) joined in 1910.\\r\\nBetween 1907 and 1911, Brcke members stayed during the summer at the Moritzburg lakes and on the island of Fehmarn.[5] In 1911, Kirchner moved to Berlin, where he founded a private art school, MIUM-Institut, in collaboration with Max Pechstein with the aim of promulgating \\"Moderner Unterricht im Malen\\" (modern teaching of painting). This was not a success and closed the following year.[5]\\r\\nIn 1913, Kirchner wrote Chronik der Brcke (Brcke chronicle), which led to the ending of the group.[5]\\r\\nDie Brcke was one of two groups of German painters fundamental to Expressionism, the other being Der Blaue Reiter group (\\"The Blue Rider\\"), formed in Munich in 1911.","input":"With what are the german die brcke artists associated?"},{"output":"April 1, 1963","context":"General Hospital (commonly abbreviated GH) is an American daytime television medical drama. It is listed in Guinness World Records as the longest-running American soap opera in production and the second longest-running drama in television in American history after Guiding Light.[2][3] Concurrently, it is the world's third longest-running scripted drama series in production after British serials The Archers and Coronation Street, as well as the world's second-longest-running televised soap opera still in production. General Hospital premiered on the ABC television network on April 1, 1963. Same-day broadcasts as well as classic episodes were aired on SOAPnet from January 20, 2000, to December 31, 2013, following Disney-ABC's decision to discontinue the network. General Hospital is the longest-running serial produced in Hollywood, and the longest-running entertainment program in ABC television history. It holds the record for most Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Drama Series, with 13 wins.[4]\\r\\nThe show was created by husband-and-wife soap writers Frank and Doris Hursley, who originally set it in a general hospital (hence the title), in an unnamed fictional city. In the 1970s, the city was named Port Charles, New York. From its beginning, General Hospital starred John Beradino and Emily McLaughlin, and both actors stayed with the show until their deaths in 1996 and 1991 respectively. They were joined a year later by Rachel Ames who remains to date the longest serving actress on an ABC soap opera, having been continuously on the show from 1964 to 2007. General Hospital was the second soap to air on ABC (after the short-lived Road to Reality, which aired for several months during the 1960ÿ61 season). In 1964, a sister soap was created for General Hospital, The Young Marrieds; it ran for two years, and was canceled because of low ratings. General Hospital also spawned a primetime spinoff with the same name in the United Kingdom from 1972 to 1979, as well as the daytime series Port Charles (1997ÿ2003) and the primetime spin-off General Hospital: Night Shift (2007ÿ2008) in the United States. Taped at The Prospect Studios, General Hospital aired for a half-hour until July 23, 1976. The series was expanded from 30 minutes to 45 minutes on July 26, 1976, and then to a full hour on January 16, 1978.[5]\\r\\nEver since the late 1970s, most of the storylines have revolved around the Quartermaines and the Spencers. From 1979 to 1988, General Hospital had more viewers than any other daytime soap opera. It rose to the top of the ratings in the early 1980s in part thanks to the monumentally popular \\"supercouple\\" Luke and Laura, whose 1981 wedding brought in 30 million viewers and remains the highest-rated hour in American soap opera history.[6][7] The soap opera is also known for its high-profile celebrity guest stars who have included, among others, Roseanne Barr, James Franco and Elizabeth Taylor. In 2007, the program was listed as one of Time magazine's \\"100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME.\\"[8] On April 23, 2009, General Hospital began broadcasting in high definition, making it the first ABC soap opera to make such a transition.[9] The serial aired its 14,000th episode on February 23, 2018.[1]\\r\\nGeneral Hospital became the oldest American soap opera on September 17, 2010, following the final broadcast of CBS' As the World Turns. On April 14, 2011, ABC announced the cancellation of both All My Children and One Life to Live, leaving General Hospital as the last remaining soap opera airing on the network after January 13, 2012.[10] The show celebrated its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Hospital was created by Frank and Doris Hursley and premiered on April 1, 1963. The first stories were mainly set on the seventh floor of General Hospital, in an unnamed midsize Eastern city (the name of the city, Port Charles, would not be mentioned until the late 1970s). \\"They had this concept of the show that it was like a big wagon wheel ÿ the spokes would be the characters and the hub would be the hospital,\\" John Beradino (Steve Hardy) later reflected to Entertainment Weekly in 1994.[11]\\r\\nLaunched in 1963, the first stories were mainly set at General Hospital in an unnamed midsized Eastern city. The name of the city, Port Charles, would not be mentioned until 1976 by headwriters Eileen and Robert Mason Pollock.[12] Storylines revolved around Dr. Steve Hardy (John Beradino) and his friend, Nurse Jessie Brewer (Emily McLaughlin). Jessie's turbulent marriage to the much-younger Dr. Phil Brewer (originally portrayed by Roy Thinnes; lastly by Martin West) was the center of many early storylines. In 1964 Audrey March (Rachel Ames), a flight attendant and sister of Nurse Lucille (Lucille Wall), came to town, and was the woman who won Steve's heart.\\r\\nBy the end of the 1970s, General Hospital was facing dire ratings when executive producer Gloria Monty was brought in to turn the show around. Monty is credited with creation of the first supercouple, Luke Spencer and Laura Webber, played by Anthony Geary and Genie Francis. The end of their hour wedding on November 17, 1981, was the most-watched event in daytime serial history.[7] During the 1980s, the series featured several high-profile action, adventure, and some science fiction-based storylines. Location shooting at sites including Mount Rushmore in South Dakota; Niagara Falls; Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Big Bear and Avalon (Catalina Island), California; and San Antonio, Texas are some that propelled the story.\\r\\nAfter Gloria Monty first left the series in 1987, General Hospital entered into a transitional phase that lasted until Wendy Riche took the position of executive producer in 1992. Under Riche, the show gained critical acclaim for its sensitive handling of social issues. In 1994, Riche started an annual Nurses' Ball, a fundraiser and AIDS awareness event both on the show and in real life. Later that year, a heart transplant storyline involves the death of eight-year-old B. J. Jones (daughter of Dr. Tony Jones and R.N. Bobbie Spencer) in a bus crash and the subsequent donation of her heart to her dying cousin Maxie Jones. Shortly afterwards, Monica Quartermaine (Leslie Charleson) begins a long battle with breast cancer, which leads to her adopting Emily Quartermaine, the orphaned young daughter of Monica's friend from treatment. General Hospital was also praised for the love story of teenagers Stone Cates (Michael Sutton) and Robin Scorpio (Kimberly McCullough). After a struggle that lasted throughout most of 1995, Stone dies from AIDS at the age of 19 and his death is followed by 17-year-old Robin having to deal with being HIV-positive as a result of their relationship. Sutton received a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and McCullough won an Outstanding Younger Actress award. ABC featured an Afterschool Special \\"Positive: A Journey Into AIDS\\" revolving around the AIDS story as well as The New York Times best selling novel Robin's Diary.\\r\\nOn Saturday, December 14, 1996, General Hospital aired its one of three primetime episodes, General Hospital: Twist of Fate, which picked up where that Friday's episode had left off. The special centered on Laura's supposed death at the hands of Stefan Cassadine. In 1997, the show's long-rumored spin-off materialized into the half-hour serial, Port Charles. The series' 11,000th episode aired on February 20, 2006.[13] On April 23, 2009, General Hospital became ABC's first regular daytime drama to be taped and broadcast in high definition, though the 2008 season of its primetime spinoff General Hospital: Night Shift was in high definition. This is the second daytime drama to move to high definition after CBS's The Young and the Restless. On February 23, 2010, the series aired its 12,000th episode.[14] On December 1, 2011, ABC confirmed that former One Life to Live executive producer Frank Valentini and head writer Ron Carlivati would replace longtime executive producer Jill Farren-Phelps and Garin Wolf respectively, though Wolf would remain on as a regular writer. The change took effect on January 9, 2012.[15] The first episode under the direction of Valentini aired on February 1, 2012, and Carlivati's material started airing on February 21, 2012. Several storylines reminiscent of iconic story arcs of the past were created and popular characters returned to the show in order to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the series in 2013.[16] The serial celebrated 13,000 episodes on February 24, 2014,[17] and marked its 51st anniversary on April 1, 2014.[18] Also in January 2014, ABC renewed Carlivati's contract with the soap.[19][20] The series marked its 52nd anniversary on April 1, 2015, with a special episode revolving around the Spencer family.[21][22][23][24]\\r\\nIn July 2015, it was revealed that Carlivati was fired as Head Writer, with Shelly Altman and Jean Passanante rehired as replacements.[25] On September 16, 2016, Daytime Confidential reported that Valentini, Passanante and Altman re-signed with the show.[26] On June 6, 2017, Passanante announced her decision to retire from the serial.[27] On July 29, 2017, it was revealed through Passanante that breakdown writer Chris Van Etten will be promoted to co-head writer along with Altman as her replacement.[28] On February 23, 2018, the serial aired its 14,000th episode.[1]\\r\\nGeneral Hospital has aired on ABC Television and has been filmed in Hollywood since its inception. The show was filmed in the Sunset Gower Studios from 1963 to the mid-1980s. It relocated in the 1980s to The Prospect Studios, where it remains.\\r\\nGeneral Hospital has had a number of different distributors throughout the show's history, From its beginning until 1968, it was a co-production of ABC-Paramount and Selmur Productions. ABC would later buy the series outright in 1968 and its owner passed from Selmur to American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., ABC's old separate conglomerate. Ownership of the soap was then passed when the original ABC, Inc. merged with Capital Cities Communications in 1985 and it became Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. The show would change hands again when The Walt Disney Company bought Capital Cities/ABC in 1996 and Disney began to program the network and the soap in September 1997 where it remains to this day.\\r\\nThough the series originally focused on solely the medical staff at Port Charles' General Hospital, and starred John Beradino as Dr. Steve Hardy and Emily McLaughlin as Nurse Jessie Brewer, the series branched out and began to focus more on the people and families of the town of Port Charles rather than those solely in the hospital.[30]\\r\\nPort Charles is full of \\"dysfunctional family dynamics...and family drama remains the focal point of this town.\\"[31] The current families on the show include the quarreling and wealthy Quartermaine family, the mobster crime Corinthos family, the middle class Scorpio/Jones family, the aristocratic Cassadine family, and the adventurous Spencer family.\\r\\nFormer notable crew members: Gloria Monty,[32] Jill Farren Phelps, Robert Guza, Jr., Charles Pratt Jr., John William Corrington, Lewis Arlt, Lynda Myles, Alan Pultz, Judith Pinsker, Joseph Behar, Stephanie Braxton, Norma Monty, Frank South, Ralph Ellis, Shelley Curtis, Hope Harmel Smith, Michael Conforti, Michele Val Jean and Ron Carlivati.[25]\\r\\nSince the series began in 1963, Port Charles, New York, has been the setting for the show. The town exists in the same fictional universe as other soap opera settings such as Llanview (One Life to Live), Pine Valley (All My Children), New York City (Ryan's Hope), and Corinth (Loving). The same setting was also used for the show's spinoff Port Charles.\\r\\nGeneral Hospital's cast and crew have won many awards since 1974 when the Daytime Emmy Awards were created. In 2012, the Creative Arts Emmy Awards were created. General Hospital has won 13 Daytime Emmy's for Outstanding Drama Series.[4]\\r\\nIn June 2009, TV Guide ranked \\"Luke and Laura's Wedding\\" #45 on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes.[33]\\r\\nDuring the 1960s, General Hospital earned decent ratings against the likes of To Tell the Truth and The Secret Storm on CBS, but there was a decline as the 1970s came, especially when NBC's Another World became highly popular. For two years, it also faced CBS' The Price Is Right, already a major hit. After continued mediocrity in the Nielsen ratings, ABC was prepared to cancel General Hospital, but decided to give it a second chance in 1978 when it expanded the show to a full hour, from an experimental 45 minutes. However, the expansion came with an ultimatum to the producers that they had six months to improve the show's ratings. Gloria Monty was hired as the new executive producer, and on her first day, she spent an extra $100,000 re-taping four episodes. A miracle occurred thanks to Monty and head writer Douglas Marland; the show became the most watched daytime drama by 1979, marking a rare instance of a daytime serial's comeback from near-extinction. During the wedding of Luke and Laura Spencer on November 17, 1981, about 30 million people tuned in to watch them exchange vows and be cursed by Elizabeth Taylor's Helena Cassadine (later played by Constance Towers).\\r\\nFrom 1979 to 1988, General Hospital remained number one in the ratings, competing against two low-rated soaps on NBC -- Texas and Santa Barbaraand Guiding Light on CBS (although Guiding Light experienced a renaissance for a brief period in the middle of 1984, and became the #1 rated soap, briefly dethroning General Hospital from the top ratings spot). For the most part, however, General Hospital continued to triumph, even after the departure of popular actors Anthony Geary and Genie Francis in the mid-1980s. Although The Young and the Restless took General Hospital's place as the highest-rated serial in 1989, General Hospital continued to maintain excellent ratings.\\r\\nEven at its peak in the 1980s, General Hospital had been pre-empted in at least two markets in the United States. With the show still number one in the Nielsens, WDTN in Dayton, Ohio pre-empted the series upon joining ABC in January 1980 in favor of Woody Woodpecker and Super Friends cartoons. Later, the station would air such shows as Hour Magazine, Geraldo and Maury in the show's time slot until September 2000, when the station's new owners, Sunrise Broadcasting (which purchased the station from Hearst Broadcasting two years prior), pulled Maury from the station's schedule, due to what it called \\"community standards\\", and brought General Hospital back to Dayton. In Vermont and Plattsburgh, WVNY dropped General Hospital from the schedule in the 1980s and would only bring it back in 1995. During that hiatus, General Hospital still aired on Montreal's CFCF-TV, whose signal was decently available in Vermont and Plattsburgh.\\r\\nEver since the 1991-1992 season of General Hospital, the show has had a steady decline in ratings. On and off, it would rank between third and fifth place in the Nielsen Ratings, with CBS's The Young And The Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful coming in first and second place, respectively. General Hospital remained in between third and fifth place in the ratings during that time and from late 1991 to 1996 All My Children held the title of ABC's highest rated soap. During the 1990s General Hospital was put up against competition such as CBS's As the World Turns and NBC's Days of Our Lives although neither show aired at the same time as General Hospital.\\r\\nAfter months of speculation and cancellation rumors, Deadline Hollywood reported on April 11, 2012, that ABC quietly made the decision to keep General Hospital on the air and to cancel instead the lower-rated talk show The Revolution.[34] On June 26, 2012, ABC officially announced that General Hospital would move to the 2 p.m. (ET) timeslot starting on September 10, 2012, once Katie Couric's new syndicated talk show, Katie, would begin to air in the 3 p.m. (ET) timeslot on many of ABC's local stations.[35] This represents the first schedule shifting for a daytime soap opera in the United States since CBS relocated As the World Turns from 1:30?p.m. (ET) to 2 p.m. (ET) in 1987.\\r\\nEncore episodes were shown every weeknight on the former cable station SOAPnet, with a marathon on Saturday and classic episodes at 4 A.M. EST and 5 A.M. (3.AM, 4 A.M. CST).\\r\\nABC stations in the Mountain and Pacific time zones, and in Alaska and Hawaii follow a Central time zone schedule for daytime programming; thus, General Hospital is scheduled by the network to air at 1:00 pm in these areas.\\r\\nFor historical ratings information, see List of U.S. daytime soap opera ratings\\r\\nThe popularity of General Hospital has gained it many parodies and references in other mainstream programs. For example:\\r\\nGeneral Hospital has many famous fans, including:\\r\\nThe success of the long-running soap opera has had one sister serial, one spinoff in the United States, and two primetime spinoffs in the United States and the United Kingdom.\\r\\nThe Young Marrieds was ABC's first attempt at a sister serial for General Hospital. It ran for only two years, racking up a total of 380 episodes. Despite its moderate popularity, it was aired against CBS's top-rated The Edge of Night, which it could not compete against. The series finale aired on March 25, 1966, with the show's main protagonist contemplating suicide. It ended in a cliffhanger, leaving the audience wondering if the man had killed himself or not. The Young Marrieds was set in the fictional suburb of Queen's Point, which was considered by the writers to be a suburb of Port Charles.\\r\\nThe UK series General Hospital did not feature any characters from the American show, but was modeled after its format. It started as a half-hour program broadcast in the afternoons, which was unusual for British serials that normally aired in prime time. In 1975, it was expanded to an hour-long format and moved to Friday evenings.\\r\\nPort Charles was a daytime drama that initially featured interns in a competitive medical school program,[47] and was known for having more action actually in the hospital than General Hospital itself. It also included the characters of Scotty Baldwin. Serena Baldwin, Lucy Coe, Kevin Collins, and Karen Wexler, all of whom originally appeared as characters on General Hospital.[47] As the show evolved, it tended more towards gothic intrigue, including supernatural elements such as vampires and life after death. It also switched formats from an open-ended daytime serial to 13-week story arcs known as \\"books\\", similar to Spanish language telenovelas.\\r\\nGeneral Hospital: Night Shift is the second American prime time spinoff of a daytime drama (the first being Our Private World, a spinoff of As the World Turns). Its first season aired from July 12, 2007, to October 4, 2007, on SOAPnet, a cable channel owned by ABC.[48] The series follows the nighttime adventures of familiar and new characters around the hospital. As of March 2008, the first season of the series was \\"SOAPnet's most-watched series ever\\", with ABC Daytime and SOAPnet President Brian Frons noting that Night Shift drew more than 1 million new viewers to the channel during its first season.[49]\\r\\nGeneral Hospital: Twist of Fate was a primetime special that aired on Saturday, December 14, 1996. The episode picked up where that Friday's show had left off. The special centered on Laura's supposed death at the hands of Stefan Cassadine.[50]\\r\\nOn April 2, 1998, General Hospital aired a primetime special in celebration of the program's 35th anniversary. Hosted by Anthony Geary, the show focused and recapped on many popular storylines including Monica's breast cancer, BJ's death, and Stone's battle with HIV. This was the first anniversary special that was broadcast in primetime and that didn't include any of the current storyline.[51][52]\\r\\nGeneral Hospital: The Real Soap Dish was a special episode of ABC news program 20/20 aired on April 6, 2013, in honor of General Hospital's 50th anniversary. It focused on the entire history of the soap, including interviews of stars and clips from the series.[53]\\r\\nOn September 5, 2014, General Hospital Now was announced as a new Variety Show/Soap web series airing exclusively on ABC.com hosted by longtime cast member Nancy Lee Grahn featuring appearances by the rest of the General Hospital Cast as well as Special Guests beginning in January 2015.[54][55]\\r\\nOn May 15 and 18, 2015, General Hospital aired two live episodes as part of its 52nd anniversary celebration, using the hashtag #GHLive to promote the broadcast on social media.[56]","input":"When was the first episode of general hospital aired?"},{"output":"Jari Hill","context":"","input":"What is the source of two china's great rivers?"},{"output":"a mathematical model for data types","context":"In computer science, an abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for data types, where a data type is defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations. This contrasts with data structures, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormally, an ADT may be defined as a \\"class of objects whose logical behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations\\";[1] this is analogous to an algebraic structure in mathematics. What is meant by \\"behavior\\" varies by author, with the two main types of formal specifications for behavior being axiomatic (algebraic) specification and an abstract model;[2] these correspond to axiomatic semantics and operational semantics of an abstract machine, respectively. Some authors also include the computational complexity (\\"cost\\"), both in terms of time (for computing operations) and space (for representing values). In practice many common data types are not ADTs, as the abstraction is not perfect, and users must be aware of issues like arithmetic overflow that are due to the representation. For example, integers are often stored as fixed width values (32-bit or 64-bit binary numbers), and thus experience integer overflow if the maximum value is exceeded.\\r\\n\\r\\nADTs are a theoretical concept in computer science, used in the design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, and software systems, and do not correspond to specific features of computer languagesmainstream computer languages do not directly support formally specified ADTs. However, various language features correspond to certain aspects of ADTs, and are easily confused with ADTs proper; these include abstract types, opaque data types, protocols, and design by contract. ADTs were first proposed by Barbara Liskov and Stephen N. Zilles in 1974, as part of the development of the CLU language.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, integers are an ADT, defined as the values , ?2, ?1, 0, 1, 2, , and by the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, together with greater than, less than, etc., which behave according to familiar mathematics (with care for integer division), independently of how the integers are represented by the computer.[a] Explicitly, \\"behavior\\" includes obeying various axioms (associativity and commutativity of addition etc.), and preconditions on operations (cannot divide by zero). Typically integers are represented in a data structure as binary numbers, most often as two's complement, but might be binary-coded decimal or in ones' complement, but the user is abstracted from the concrete choice of representation, and can simply use the data as data types.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn ADT consists not only of operations, but also of values of the underlying data and of constraints on the operations. An \\"interface\\" typically refers only to the operations, and perhaps some of the constraints on the operations, notably pre-conditions and post-conditions, but not other constraints, such as relations between the operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, an abstract stack, which is a last-in-first-out structure, could be defined by three operations: push, that inserts a data item onto the stack; pop, that removes a data item from it; and peek or top, that accesses a data item on top of the stack without removal. An abstract queue, which is a first-in-first-out structure, would also have three operations: enqueue, that inserts a data item into the queue; dequeue, that removes the first data item from it; and front, that accesses and serves the first data item in the queue. There would be no way of differentiating these two data types, unless a mathematical constraint is introduced that for a stack specifies that each pop always returns the most recently pushed item that has not been popped yet. When analyzing the efficiency of algorithms that use stacks, one may also specify that all operations take the same time no matter how many data items have been pushed into the stack, and that the stack uses a constant amount of storage for each element.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbstract data types are purely theoretical entities, used (among other things) to simplify the description of abstract algorithms, to classify and evaluate data structures, and to formally describe the type systems of programming languages. However, an ADT may be implemented by specific data types or data structures, in many ways and in many programming languages; or described in a formal specification language. ADTs are often implemented as modules: the module's interface declares procedures that correspond to the ADT operations, sometimes with comments that describe the constraints. This information hiding strategy allows the implementation of the module to be changed without disturbing the client programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term abstract data type can also be regarded as a generalized approach of a number of algebraic structures, such as lattices, groups, and rings.[4] The notion of abstract data types is related to the concept of data abstraction, important in object-oriented programming and design by contract methodologies for software development.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn abstract data type is defined as a mathematical model of the data objects that make up a data type as well as the functions that operate on these objects.\\r\\nThere are no standard conventions for defining them. A broad division may be drawn between \\"imperative\\" and \\"functional\\" definition styles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the philosophy of imperative programming languages, an abstract data structure is conceived as an entity that is mutablemeaning that it may be in different states at different times. Some operations may change the state of the ADT; therefore, the order in which operations are evaluated is important, and the same operation on the same entities may have different effects if executed at different timesjust like the instructions of a computer, or the commands and procedures of an imperative language. To underscore this view, it is customary to say that the operations are executed or applied, rather than evaluated. The imperative style is often used when describing abstract algorithms. (See The Art of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth for more details)\\r\\n\\r\\nImperative-style definitions of ADT often depend on the concept of an abstract variable, which may be regarded as the simplest non-trivial ADT. An abstract variable V is a mutable entity that admits two operations:\\r\\n\\r\\nwith the constraint that\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in so many programming languages, the operation store(V, x) is often written V K x (or some similar notation), and fetch(V) is implied whenever a variable V is used in a context where a value is required. Thus, for example, V K V + 1 is commonly understood to be a shorthand for store(V,fetch(V) + 1).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this definition, it is implicitly assumed that storing a value into a variable U has no effect on the state of a distinct variable V. To make this assumption explicit, one could add the constraint that\\r\\n\\r\\nMore generally, ADT definitions often assume that any operation that changes the state of one ADT instance has no effect on the state of any other instance (including other instances of the same ADT)  unless the ADT axioms imply that the two instances are connected (aliased) in that sense. For example, when extending the definition of abstract variable to include abstract records, the operation that selects a field from a record variable R must yield a variable V that is aliased to that part of R.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe definition of an abstract variable V may also restrict the stored values x to members of a specific set X, called the range or type of V. As in programming languages, such restrictions may simplify the description and analysis of algorithms, and improve their readability.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that this definition does not imply anything about the result of evaluating fetch(V) when V is un-initialized, that is, before performing any store operation on V. An algorithm that does so is usually considered invalid, because its effect is not defined. (However, there are some important algorithms whose efficiency strongly depends on the assumption that such a fetch is legal, and returns some arbitrary value in the variable's range.[citation needed])\\r\\n\\r\\nSome algorithms need to create new instances of some ADT (such as new variables, or new stacks). To describe such algorithms, one usually includes in the ADT definition a create() operation that yields an instance of the ADT, usually with axioms equivalent to\\r\\n\\r\\nThis axiom may be strengthened to exclude also partial aliasing with other instances. On the other hand, this axiom still allows implementations of create() to yield a previously created instance that has become inaccessible to the program.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs another example, an imperative-style definition of an abstract stack could specify that the state of a stack S can be modified only by the operations\\r\\n\\r\\nwith the constraint that\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the assignment V K x, by definition, cannot change the state of S, this condition implies that V K pop(S) restores S to the state it had before the push(S, x). From this condition and from the properties of abstract variables, it follows, for example, that the sequence\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere x, y, and z are any values, and U, V, W are pairwise distinct variables, is equivalent to\\r\\n\\r\\nHere it is implicitly assumed that operations on a stack instance do not modify the state of any other ADT instance, including other stacks; that is,\\r\\n\\r\\nAn abstract stack definition usually includes also a Boolean-valued function empty(S) and a create() operation that returns a stack instance, with axioms equivalent to\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes an ADT is defined as if only one instance of it existed during the execution of the algorithm, and all operations were applied to that instance, which is not explicitly notated. For example, the abstract stack above could have been defined with operations push(x) and pop(), that operate on the only existing stack. ADT definitions in this style can be easily rewritten to admit multiple coexisting instances of the ADT, by adding an explicit instance parameter (like S in the previous example) to every operation that uses or modifies the implicit instance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, some ADTs cannot be meaningfully defined without assuming multiple instances. This is the case when a single operation takes two distinct instances of the ADT as parameters. For an example, consider augmenting the definition of the abstract stack with an operation compare(S, T) that checks whether the stacks S and T contain the same items in the same order.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother way to define an ADT, closer to the spirit of functional programming, is to consider each state of the structure as a separate entity. In this view, any operation that modifies the ADT is modeled as a mathematical function that takes the old state as an argument, and returns the new state as part of the result. Unlike the imperative operations, these functions have no side effects. Therefore, the order in which they are evaluated is immaterial, and the same operation applied to the same arguments (including the same input states) will always return the same results (and output states).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the functional view, in particular, there is no way (or need) to define an \\"abstract variable\\" with the semantics of imperative variables (namely, with fetch and store operations). Instead of storing values into variables, one passes them as arguments to functions.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, a complete functional-style definition of an abstract stack could use the three operations:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a functional-style definition there is no need for a create operation. Indeed, there is no notion of \\"stack instance\\". The stack states can be thought of as being potential states of a single stack structure, and two stack states that contain the same values in the same order are considered to be identical states. This view actually mirrors the behavior of some concrete implementations, such as linked lists with hash cons.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of create(), a functional-style definition of an abstract stack may assume the existence of a special stack state, the empty stack, designated by a special symbol like  or \\"()\\"; or define a bottom() operation that takes no arguments and returns this special stack state. Note that the axioms imply that\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a functional-style definition of a stack one does not need an empty predicate: instead, one can test whether a stack is empty by testing whether it is equal to .\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that these axioms do not define the effect of top(s) or pop(s), unless s is a stack state returned by a push. Since push leaves the stack non-empty, those two operations are undefined (hence invalid) when s = . On the other hand, the axioms (and the lack of side effects) imply that push(s, x) = push(t, y) if and only if x = y and s = t.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in some other branches of mathematics, it is customary to assume also that the stack states are only those whose existence can be proved from the axioms in a finite number of steps. In the abstract stack example above, this rule means that every stack is a finite sequence of values, that becomes the empty stack () after a finite number of pops. By themselves, the axioms above do not exclude the existence of infinite stacks (that can be poped forever, each time yielding a different state) or circular stacks (that return to the same state after a finite number of pops). In particular, they do not exclude states s such that pop(s) = s or push(s, x) = s for some x. However, since one cannot obtain such stack states with the given operations, they are assumed \\"not to exist\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from the behavior in terms of axioms, it is also possible to include, in the definition of an ADT operation, their algorithmic complexity. Alexander Stepanov, designer of the C++ Standard Template Library, included complexity guarantees in the STL specification, arguing:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason for introducing the notion of abstract data types was to allow interchangeable software modules. You cannot have interchangeable modules unless these modules share similar complexity behavior. If I replace one module with another module with the same functional behavior but with different complexity tradeoffs, the user of this code will be unpleasantly surprised. I could tell him anything I like about data abstraction, and he still would not want to use the code. Complexity assertions have to be part of the interface.\\r\\nAbstraction provides a promise that any implementation of the ADT has certain properties and abilities; knowing these is all that is required to make use of an ADT object. The user does not need any technical knowledge of how the implementation works to use the ADT. In this way, the implementation may be complex but will be encapsulated in a simple interface when it is actually used.\\r\\n\\r\\nCode that uses an ADT object will not need to be edited if the implementation of the ADT is changed. Since any changes to the implementation must still comply with the interface, and since code using an ADT object may only refer to properties and abilities specified in the interface, changes may be made to the implementation without requiring any changes in code where the ADT is used.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent implementations of the ADT, having all the same properties and abilities, are equivalent and may be used somewhat interchangeably in code that uses the ADT. This gives a great deal of flexibility when using ADT objects in different situations. For example, different implementations of the ADT may be more efficient in different situations; it is possible to use each in the situation where they are preferable, thus increasing overall efficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome operations that are often specified for ADTs (possibly under other names) are\\r\\n\\r\\nIn imperative-style ADT definitions, one often finds also\\r\\n\\r\\nThe free operation is not normally relevant or meaningful, since ADTs are theoretical entities that do not \\"use memory\\". However, it may be necessary when one needs to analyze the storage used by an algorithm that uses the ADT. In that case one needs additional axioms that specify how much memory each ADT instance uses, as a function of its state, and how much of it is returned to the pool by free.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome common ADTs, which have proved useful in a great variety of applications, are\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of these ADTs may be defined in many ways and variants, not necessarily equivalent. For example, an abstract stack may or may not have a count operation that tells how many items have been pushed and not yet popped. This choice makes a difference not only for its clients but also for the implementation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn extension of ADT for computer graphics was proposed in 1979:[7] an abstract graphical data type (AGDT). It was introduced by Nadia Magnenat Thalmann, and Daniel Thalmann. AGDTs provide the advantages of ADTs with facilities to build graphical objects in a structured way.\\r\\n\\r\\nImplementing an ADT means providing one procedure or function for each abstract operation. The ADT instances are represented by some concrete data structure that is manipulated by those procedures, according to the ADT's specifications.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsually there are many ways to implement the same ADT, using several different concrete data structures. Thus, for example, an abstract stack can be implemented by a linked list or by an array.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to prevent clients from depending on the implementation, an ADT is often packaged as an opaque data type in one or more modules, whose interface contains only the signature (number and types of the parameters and results) of the operations. The implementation of the modulenamely, the bodies of the procedures and the concrete data structure usedcan then be hidden from most clients of the module. This makes it possible to change the implementation without affecting the clients. If the implementation is exposed, it is known instead as a transparent data type.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen implementing an ADT, each instance (in imperative-style definitions) or each state (in functional-style definitions) is usually represented by a handle of some sort.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern object-oriented languages, such as C++ and Java, support a form of abstract data types. When a class is used as a type, it is an abstract type that refers to a hidden representation. In this model an ADT is typically implemented as a class, and each instance of the ADT is usually an object of that class. The module's interface typically declares the constructors as ordinary procedures, and most of the other ADT operations as methods of that class. However, such an approach does not easily encapsulate multiple representational variants found in an ADT. It also can undermine the extensibility of object-oriented programs.\\r\\nIn a pure object-oriented program that uses interfaces as types, types refer to behaviors not representations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an example, here is an implementation of the abstract stack above in the C programming language.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn imperative-style interface might be:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis interface could be used in the following manner:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis interface can be implemented in many ways. The implementation may be arbitrarily inefficient, since the formal definition of the ADT, above, does not specify how much space the stack may use, nor how long each operation should take. It also does not specify whether the stack state s continues to exist after a call x K pop(s).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn practice the formal definition should specify that the space is proportional to the number of items pushed and not yet popped; and that every one of the operations above must finish in a constant amount of time, independently of that number. To comply with these additional specifications, the implementation could use a linked list, or an array (with dynamic resizing) together with two integers (an item count and the array size).\\r\\n\\r\\nFunctional-style ADT definitions are more appropriate for functional programming languages, and vice versa. However, one can provide a functional-style interface even in an imperative language like C. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\nMany modern programming languages, such as C++ and Java, come with standard libraries that implement several common ADTs, such as those listed above.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe specification of some programming languages is intentionally vague about the representation of certain built-in data types, defining only the operations that can be done on them. Therefore, those types can be viewed as \\"built-in ADTs\\". Examples are the arrays in many scripting languages, such as Awk, Lua, and Perl, which can be regarded as an implementation of the abstract list.","input":"What is an abstract data type in java?"},{"output":"Legacy Light or Skybeam","context":"The Space Needle is an observation tower in Seattle, Washington, a landmark of the Pacific Northwest, and an icon of Seattle. It was built in the Seattle Center for the 1962 World's Fair, which drew over 2.3 million visitors, when nearly 20,000 people a day used its elevators.\\r\\nOnce the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River,[7] it is 605?ft (184?m) high, 138?ft (42?m) wide, and weighs 9,550 tons. It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 miles per hour (89?m/s) and earthquakes of up to 9.1 magnitude,[8] as strong as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. It also has 25 lightning rods.\\r\\nIt has an observation deck at 520?ft (160?m) and the rotating SkyCity restaurant at 500?ft (150?m).[7] The downtown Seattle skyline, as well as the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Elliott Bay and surrounding islands can be viewed from the top of the Needle. Photographs of the Seattle skyline often show the Space Needle prominently, above skyscrapers and Mount Rainier.\\r\\nVisitors can reach the top of the Space Needle by elevators that travel at 10 miles per hour (4.5?m/s). The trip takes 41 seconds. On windy days, the elevators slow to 5 miles per hour (2.2?m/s). On April 19, 1999, the city's Landmarks Preservation Board designated it a historic landmark.[7][9]\\r\\nIn September 2017, the restaurant was temporarily closed as part of a $100 million renovation that is scheduled for completion in May 2018. The renovation includes the installation of a new rotation motor and see-through glass floors in the restaurant, as well as the replacement of the observation deck's wire enclosure with glass panels. The observation deck will remain open for the duration of the project.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe architecture of the Space Needle is the result of a compromise between the designs of two men, Edward E. Carlson and John Graham, Jr. The two leading ideas for the World Fair involved businessman Edward E. Carlson's sketch of a giant balloon tethered to the ground (see the gently sloping base) and architect John Graham's concept of a flying saucer (see the halo that houses the restaurant and observation deck).[7] Victor Steinbrueck introduced the hourglass profile of the tower.[11] The Space Needle was built to withstand wind speeds of 200?mph (322?km/h), double the requirements in the building code of 1962. The 6.8 Mw Nisqually earthquake jolted the Needle enough in 2001 for water to slosh out of the toilets in the restrooms. The Space Needle will not sustain serious structural damage during earthquakes of magnitudes below 9. Also made to withstand Category 5 hurricane-force winds, the Space Needle sways only 1?inch per 10?mph (16?mm per 10?km/h) of wind speed.\\r\\nFor decades, the hovering disk of the Space Needle was home to two restaurants 500?ft (150?m) above the ground: the Space Needle Restaurant, which was originally named Eye of the Needle, and Emerald Suite. These were closed in 2000 to make way for SkyCity, a larger restaurant that features Pacific Northwest cuisine. It rotates 360 degrees in exactly forty-seven minutes.[12] In 1993, the elevators were replaced with new computerized versions. The new elevators descend at a rate of 10 miles per hour (4.5?m/s).\\r\\nOn December 31, 1999, a powerful beam of light was unveiled for the first time. Called the Legacy Light or Skybeam, it is powered by lamps that total 85 million candela shining skyward from the top of the Space Needle to honor national holidays and special occasions in Seattle. The concept of this beam was derived from the official 1962 World's Fair poster, which depicted such a light source although none was incorporated into the original design. It is somewhat controversial because of the light pollution it creates.[13] Originally planned to be turned on 75 nights per year, it has generally been used fewer than a dozen times per year. It did remain lit for eleven days in a row from September 11, 2001, to September 22, 2001, in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks.[14]\\r\\nA 1962 Seattle World's Fair poster[15] showed a grand spiral entryway leading to the elevator that was ultimately omitted from final building plans.[16] The stairway was eventually added as part of the Pavilion and Spacebase remodel in June 2000. The main stairwell has 848 steps from the basement to the top of the observation deck.[7] At approximately 605?ft (184?m), the Space Needle was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River at the time it was built by Howard S. Wright Construction Co., but is now dwarfed by other structures along the Seattle skyline, among them the Columbia Center, at 967?ft (295?m).[17] Unlike many other similar structures, such as the CN Tower in Toronto, the Space Needle is not used for broadcasting purposes.\\r\\nEdward F. Carlson, chairman of the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle, originally had an idea for erecting a tower with a restaurant at the World's Fair. Carlson was then president of a hotel company and not previously known for art or design, but he was inspired by a recent visit to the Stuttgart Tower of Germany. John Graham, an architect who had won praise for designing the Northgate Mall in Seattle, soon became involved. Graham's first move was to alter the restaurant featured in the plans to a revolving restaurant, in the same manner as on a tower (La Ronde) he had previously designed for the Ala Moana Shopping Center.\\r\\nThe proposed Space Needle had no land where they could build. Since it was not financed by the city, land had to be purchased that was within the fairgrounds. The investors thought that there would be no land available to build a tower and the search for a site was nearly dead when, in 1961, they discovered a plot, 120 by 120?ft (37 by 37?m), containing switching equipment for the fire and police alarm systems. The land sold for $75,000. At this point, only one year remained before the World's Fair would begin. It was privately built and financed by the Pentagram Corporation, which consisted of Bagley Wright, contractor Howard S. Wright, architect John Graham, Ned Skinner, and Norton Clapp. In 1977 Bagley, Skinner and Clapp sold their interest to Howard Wright who now controls it under the name of Space Needle Corporation.[18]\\r\\nThe earthquake stability of the Space Needle was ensured when a hole was dug 30?ft (9.1?m) deep and 120?ft (37?m) across, and 467 concrete trucks took one full day to fill it. The foundation weighs 5850 tons (including 250 tons of reinforcing steel), the same as the above-ground structure. The structure is bolted to the foundation with 72 bolts, each one 30?ft (9.1?m) long.\\r\\nWith time an issue, the construction team worked around the clock. The domed top, housing the top five levels (including the restaurants and observation deck), was perfectly balanced so that the restaurant could rotate with the help of one tiny electric motor, originally 0.8 kilowatts (1.1?hp), later replaced with a 1.1 kilowatts (1.5?hp) motor. With paint colors named Orbital Olive for the body, Astronaut White for the legs, Re-entry Red for the saucer, and Galaxy Gold for the roof, the Space Needle was finished in less than one year. It was completed in April 1962 at a cost of $4.5 million. The last elevator car was installed the day before the Fair opened on April 21. During the course of the Fair nearly 20,000 people a day rode the elevators to the Observation Deck. The 20,000 mark was never reached, missed by fewer than 50 people one day. At the time of construction, it was the tallest building in the West, taking the title from the Smith Tower across town that had held that title since 1914.\\r\\nThe revolving restaurant was operated by Western International Hotels, of which Carlson was President,[19] under a 20-year contract from April 1, 1962 to April 1, 1982.[20]\\r\\nAn imitation carillon[21] (a multi-bell musical device) was installed in the Space Needle, and played several times a day during the World's Fair. The instrument, built by the Schulmerich Bells Company of Hatfield, Pennsylvania[22] under the name \\"Carillon Americana,\\" recreated the sounds of 538 bells and was the largest in the world, until eclipsed by a 732 bell instrument at the 1964 New York World's Fair. The operator's console was located in the base of the Space Needle, completely enclosed in glass to allow observation of the musician playing the instrument. It was also capable of being played from a roll, just as a player piano would be. The forty-four stentors (speakers) of the carillon were located underneath the Needle's disc at the 200 foot level, and were audible over the entire fairgrounds and up to ten miles away.[23] The carillon was disassembled after the fair's close.\\r\\nThe carillon bells were featured on an LP record called \\"Bells On Hi-Fi\\" (catalog number AR-8, produced by Americana Records, of Sellersville, Pennsylvania). There are 12 pieces recorded on the \\"Carillon Americana\\" before it was installed in the Space Needle, performed by noted carilloneur John Klein (1915-1981).[24][25]\\r\\nIn 1974, author Stephen Cosgrove's children's book Wheedle on the Needle postulated a furry creature called a Wheedle who lived on top of the Space Needle and caused its light to flash. Its closing quatrain is: There's a Wheedle on the Needle?/ I know just what you're thinking?/ But if you look up late at night?/ You'll see his red nose blinking. The Wheedle has since become a fixture of Seattle. It even became the mascot of the Seattle SuperSonics National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise, who played in nearby KeyArena (originally known as the Seattle Center Coliseum). The SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City on July 3, 2008.\\r\\nIn 1982, the SkyLine level was added at a height of 100?ft (30?m). While this level had been depicted in the original plans for the Space Needle, it was not built until this time. Today, the SkyLine Banquet Facility can accommodate groups of 20ÿ360 people.\\r\\nRenovations were completed in 2000 that cost approximately the same as the original construction price ($21 million in current currency). Renovations between 1999 and 2000 included the SkyCity restaurant, SpaceBase retail store, Skybeam installation, Observation Deck overhaul, lighting additions and repainting.\\r\\nEvery year on New Year's Eve, the Space Needle celebrates with a fireworks show at midnight that is synchronized to music. The worldwide renowned fireworks artist from Bellevue, Alberto Navarro has been designing the show for the past 20 year since its inception in 1994. In 2000, public celebrations were canceled but the fireworks show was still performed because of perceived terror threats against the structure after investigations into the foiled millennium bombing plots.\\r\\nOn May 19, 2007, the Space Needle welcomed its 45 millionth visitor, Greg Novoa of San Francisco. He received a free trip for two to Paris, which included a VIP dinner at the Eiffel Tower.[26]\\r\\nIn May 2008, the Space Needle received its first professional cleaning since the opening of the 1962 World's Fair. The monument was pressure washed by K?rcher[27] with water at a pressure of 20,000 kilopascals (2,900?psi) and a temperature of 90?C (194?F). No detergents were used in consideration of the Seattle Center and the EMP building.[28]\\r\\nAs part of the celebration of its 50th anniversary, the Needle was painted \\"Galaxy Gold\\" in April 2012, the same color used when the needle was originally constructed for the 1962 World's Fair.[29] This temporary makeover, intended to last through the summer, is not the Needle's first: it had the University of Washington (UW) Huskies football team logo painted on after the team won the 1992 Rose Bowl, appeared as a giant \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" in 1995, was painted crimson after Washington State won the Apple Cup,[30] and has been seen in Seattle SuperSonics colors.[7]\\r\\nA renovation of the top of the Space Needle was begun in the summer of 2017, to add an all-glass floor to the restaurant, and replace the observation platform windows with unbroken floor-to-ceiling glass panels unobstructed by mullions to more closely match the 1962 original concept sketches, as well as various upgrades and updates to the internal systems. Called the Century Project, the work is scheduled to finish by June 2018, at a cost of $100 million in private funds. The rotating restaurant's motor will be replaced, and the elevator capacity will be increased by adding elevators, or double-stacking them, and the energy efficiency of the building will be improved with the aim of achieving LEED Silver Certification. The temporary scaffold's 28,000-pound (13,000?kg), 44,650-square-foot (4,148?m2) platform under the top structure was assembled on the ground, and then lifted by cables 500?ft (150?m) from the ground to the underside of the structure, controlled by 12 operators standing on the platform as it was raised. The platform is the largest in circumference ever made by Safway Services, a company specializing in unique construction scaffolding.[31][32][33][34]\\r\\nSix parachutists have leaped from the tower since its opening, in a sport known as BASE jumping. This activity is only legal with prior consent. Four of them were part of an authorized promotion in 1996,[35] and the other two were arrested.[36]\\r\\nPaul D. Baker was the first person to jump from the Space Needle in a successful suicide attempt on March 4, 1974.[37]\\r\\nMary Lucille Wolf purchased a ticket for the elevator to the observation deck on May 25, 1974 where she proceeded to scale the glass fence surrounding the deck onto the edge and jumped off in what the Seattle Police Department called \\"an obvious suicide\\".[37] Police found a correspondence in Wolf's purse that was from a friend extending their condolences regarding the recent death of Wolf's husband.[37]\\r\\nFollowing the two suicides in 1974 a netting and additional fencing were installed on the observation deck.[38] However, another suicide occurred on July 5, 1978 when an unidentified \\"young woman\\" as described in a United Press International report climbed over the suicide-prevention netting and leaped to her death on the northeast side of the structure.[39]\\r\\nBeing a major symbol of the Pacific Northwest, the Space Needle has made numerous appearances in films, TV shows and other works of fiction. A few examples of films include It Happened at the World's Fair (1962), where it was used as a filming location, and Sleepless in Seattle (1993). In the 1974 film The Parallax View, the inside and outside platforms of the observation deck are the setting for a political assassination, and there's a brief chase on the roof above it. In the 1999 film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, it served as a base of operations for the villain Doctor Evil with the word Starbucks written across its saucer after his henchman Number 2 shifted the organization's resources toward the coffee company.[40][41][42] It is also featured prominently in Chronicle (2012), and is a key element in the film's climax. On April 1, 2015, public radio station KPLU 88.5 FM reported in the news story \\"Proposed Development To 'Assimilate' Seattle's Landmark Space Needle?\\" that a permit application (Notice of Proposed Land Use Action) had been submitted \\"to construct a 666 unit cube to assimilate\\" the landmark. The story is an April Fools' Day practical joke.[43]\\r\\nIn TV shows, one of the most prominent showings is in the series Frasier where an outline of it appears in the opening credits and the base of it is visible from the high-rise condo although the view is really a composite image as there are no high rise condos in the right area of that height.[44]\\r\\nOther TV appearances include The History Channel's Life After People, in which it collapses after 200 years because of corrosion. It was also destroyed in the TV miniseries 10.5 when a 7.9 earthquake hits Seattle. The movie mistakenly portrays the Needle as crumbling concrete, though the structure is actually made of iron and designed to withstand up to a 9.0 earthquake. The needle is also featured in some episodes of Bill Nye the Science Guy, such as the episode \\"Storms\\" where Bill Nye uses the lightning rod on top of it as an example of conducting lightning strikes. Max Guevara, the main character from the series Dark Angel which is set in a post-apocalyptic Seattle, is often seen on the roof of the derelict Space Needle.[45]\\r\\nThe Space Needle has been used for some other purposes as well, including a 57 piece Lego construction set of it that has been released as part of Lego Architecture's structures.[46][47]\\r\\nThe top of the Space Needle decorated for Memorial Day\\r\\nNight view\\r\\nThe Space Needle in the 1960s\\r\\nA 1962 commemorative postage stamp of the Space Needle\\r\\nView of the Space Needle from base\\r\\nView from the base of the Needle\\r\\nThe Space Needle, framed on a foggy night by the ferris wheel\\r\\nThe gift shop in the Space Needle\\r\\nThe Space Needle at night as seen from Kerry Park\\r\\nSupporting nut and bolt at base of the Space Needle\\r\\nThe Space Needle seen at sunset\\r\\nThe Space Needle in the foreground of an aerial photo of Seattle; the Museum of Pop Culture adjacent to the Space Needle, on the left\\r\\nThe Seattle Center International Fountain with the Space Needle in the background\\r\\nDowntown Seattle seen from atop the Space Needle","input":"What is on top of the space needle?"},{"output":"2 shift solenoids","context":"The 4L60-E (and similar 4L65-E) is a series of automatic transmissions from General Motors.

Schmutz as president, with Michael John U. Teh and Taniela B. Wakolo as counselors.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first contact the church had with the Philippines was in 1898 during the SpanishÿAmerican War. Two LDS men, Willard Call and George Seaman, who were part of the United States artillery battery, were set apart as missionaries and began to proselytize after being deployed to the Philippines. However, they met with little success.[4] Active proselytizing stopped on the onset of World War II.[5]\\r\\nThe first Filipino to join the LDS Church was Aneleta Pabilona Fajardo in 1945, who was introduced to the church by Maxine Grimm, who was in the Philippines with the Red Cross in the aftermath of World War II.[4]\\r\\nThe Luzon Serviceman's District was organized during the Korean War under the Japanese Mission for American servicemen stationed in the Philippines. In August 1955, the district was then transferred to the newly organized Southern Far East Mission, under the direction of Joseph Fielding Smith, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve.[4] During this time, Smith visited the Philippines. Due to legal issues, the LDS Church could not send missionaries to the country. Missionary work, however, was done by LDS servicemen and American residents, including Kendall B. Schaefermeyer, a returned missionary serving in the U.S. Navy.[4] He had baptized four Filipinos by October 1957 and was teaching more than 20 others.[4]\\r\\nDuring 1960, Gordon B. Hinckley, then an Assistant to the Twelve, and apostle Ezra Taft Benson, visited the Philippines.[4] The purpose of the visit was mainly to see the work of the LDS servicemen groups, but they brought back encouraging reports of the missionary work being done among the native Filipinos.[4]\\r\\nThe church obtained official recognition in the Philippines in 1961 when Robert S. Taylor, president of the Southern Far East Mission, filed the paperwork with the Philippine government.[4] Subsequently, on 28 April 1961 in a meeting with servicemen, American residents, and Filipino members, Hinckley rededicated the country.[4] The first American missionaries (Ray Goodson, Harry Murray, Kent Lowe and Nestor Ledesma) arrived in Manila two months later.[4] One of the first converts after official recognition was the family of Jos Gutierez, Sr. After the end of the years, six more were baptized.[4]\\r\\nDue to growth that followed, the Philippines was organized into its own mission by 1967, with Paul S. Rose as the first president.[4] In 1969, the church spread across the islands, having the highest amount of baptisms compared to every other area of the world.[5] This led to the division of the Philippines Mission in 1974 into two separate missions, the Philippines Manila and Philippines Cebu City missions.[4]\\r\\nThe first stake in the Philippines was formed in Manila on 20 May 1973.[2][6] In September of 2017, the number of stakes in the Philippines reached 100, only the fifth nation in the world to reach that milestone.[7]\\r\\nChurch president Spencer W.

It stretches 828.0 kilometres (514.5?mi) from Windsor in the west to the OntarioÿQuebec border in the east. The part of Highway?401 that passes through Toronto is North America's busiest highway,[4][5] and one of the widest.[6][7] Together with Quebec Autoroute 20, it forms the road transportation backbone of the Quebec CityÿWindsor Corridor, along which over half of Canada's population resides and is also a Core Route in the National Highway System of Canada. The route is maintained by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) and patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police. The speed limit is 100?km/h (62?mph) throughout its length, unless posted otherwise.\\r\\nBy the end of 1952, three individual highways were numbered \\"Highway?401\\": the partially completed Toronto Bypass between Weston Road and Highway?11 (Yonge Street); Highway?2A between West Hill and Newcastle; and the Scenic Highway between Gananoque and Brockville, now known as the Thousand Islands Parkway. These three sections of highway were 11.8, 54.7 and 41.2?km, (7.3, 34.0 and 25.6?mi), respectively. In 1964, the route became fully navigable from Windsor to the OntarioÿQuebec border. In 1965 it was given a second designation, the MacdonaldÿCartier Freeway, in honour of two Fathers of Confederation. At the end of 1968, the GananoqueÿBrockville section was bypassed and the final intersection grade-separated near Kingston, making Highway?401 a freeway for its entire 817.9-km length. On August 24, 2007, the portion of the highway between Glen Miller Road in Trenton and the Don Valley Parkway?/ Highway?404 Junction in Toronto was designated the Highway of Heroes, as the road is travelled by funeral convoys for fallen Canadian Forces personnel from CFB Trenton to the coroner's office in Toronto. On September 27, 2013, the Highway of Heroes designation was extended west to Keele Street in Toronto, to coincide with the move of the coroner's office to the new Forensic Services and Coroner's Complex at the Humber River Hospital.\\r\\nIn 2011, construction began on a westward extension called the Right Honourable Herb Gray Parkway. This new route follows, but does not replace, former Highway?3 between the former end of the freeway and the E. C. Row Expressway, at which point it turns and parallels that route towards the site of the future Gordie Howe International Bridge. An 8-kilometre (5?mi) section of the parkway, east of the E. C. Row interchange, opened on June?28, 2015, with the remaining section completed and opened on November 21. Elsewhere in Ontario, plans are under way to widen the remaining four-lane sections between Windsor and London to six lanes and to widen the route between Kitchener and Milton as well as through Oshawa. The expansive twelve-plus-lane collectorÿexpress system will also be extended west through Mississauga to Milton and east through Ajax and Whitby.\\r\\nHighway?401 extends across Southwestern, Central and Eastern Ontario. In anticipation of the future expansion of the highway, the transportation ministry purchased a 91.4-metre-wide (300?ft) right-of-way along the entire length. Generally, the highway occupies only a portion of this allotment.[8] It is one of the world's busiest highways;[6] a 2008 analysis stated the annual average daily traffic (AADT) count between Weston Road and Highway?400 in Toronto was approximately 450,000,[2] while a second study estimate over 500,000?vehicles travel that section on some days.[5] This makes it North America's busiest roadway, surpassing the Santa Monica Freeway in Los Angeles and I-75 in Atlanta.[7][9] The just-in-time auto parts delivery systems of the highly integrated automotive industry of Michigan and Ontario have contributed to the highway's status as the world's busiest truck route,[10] carrying 60?percent of vehicular trade between Canada and the US.[7]\\r\\nHighway?401 also features North America's busiest multi-structure bridge, located at Hogg's Hollow in Toronto.[10] The four bridges, two for each direction with the collector and express lanes, carried an average of 373,700?vehicles daily in 2006.[2] The highway is one of the major backbones of a network in the Great Lakes region, connecting the populous Quebec CityÿWindsor corridor with Michigan, New York and central Ontario's cottage country.[11] It is the principal connection between Toronto and Montreal, becoming Autoroute?20 at the OntarioÿQuebec border.[12]\\r\\nHighway?401 does not yet extend the last few kilometres to Detroit;[13] an extension to Brighton Beach (at the CanadaÿUS border in Windsor) was completed in November 2015, after which the Gordie Howe International Bridge will extend Highway?401 across the CanadaÿUnited States border through Delray to Interstate 75 in Michigan by 2019.[14][15] At present, Highway?401 begins as a six-lane freeway at the west end of the E. C. Row Expressway. At the Dougall Parkway, the highway turns east and exits Windsor.[16] From here, Highway?401 mostly parallels the former route of Highway?98 from Windsor to Tilbury.[17]\\r\\nSouthwestern Ontario is flat, primarily agricultural land, that takes advantage of the fertile clay soil deposited throughout the region.[18][19] The main river through the region is the Thames River, which drains the second largest watershed in southern Ontario and largely influences the land use surrounding the highway;[20] It parallels the route to the north between Tilbury and Woodstock.[16]\\r\\nNear Tilbury, Highway?401 loses its tall wall median barrier and narrows to four lanes, following lot lines laid between concession roads in a plan designed to limit damage to the sensitive agricultural lands through which the highway runs.[21] Here the highway's flat and straight route is notorious for leading to driver inattention.[22] The section from Windsor to London (especially west of Tilbury) has become known for deadly car accidents and pile-ups, earning it the nickname Carnage Alley.[23] As the highway approaches London, Highway?402 merges in,[16] resulting in a six-lane cross-section.[24][25] Within London, it intersects the city's two municipal expressways, Highbury Avenue and the Veterans Memorial Parkway.[26]\\r\\nThe section between London and Woodstock generally parallels the former Highway?2 but lies on the south side of the Thames River.[16] This area is not as flat but the highway is generally straight. This part of Highway?401 often experiences heavy snowsqualls in early winter, sometimes extending as far east as Toronto. To the south of Woodstock, Highway?401 curves northeast and encounters the western terminus of Highway?403.[26] The highway heads towards Kitchener and Cambridge, where it encounters Highway?8 and returns to its eastward orientation.[16][27] East of Cambridge, the highway meanders towards Milton, passing through hills and rock cuts along the way.[28]\\r\\nAs Highway?401 approaches the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), it descends through the ecologically protected Niagara Escarpment to the west of Milton.[29][30] Upon entering the town, it enters the first urbanized section of the GTA, passing through two rural areas between there and Oshawa.[16][31] The first rural gap is the western side of Toronto's Greenbelt, a zone around Toronto protected from development.[29] After this 10?km (6.2?mi) gap, the highway interchanges with the Highway?407 Express Toll Route. Within the GTA, the highway passes several major shopping malls including Yorkdale Shopping Centre, Scarborough Town Centre and Pickering Town Centre.[32][33][34]\\r\\nHighway?401 widens into a collector-express system[35] as it approaches Hurontario Street in Mississauga, a concept inspired by the Dan Ryan Expressway in Chicago.[8] The system divides each direction of travel into collector and express lanes,[36] giving the highway a wide span and four carriageways. To avoid confusion between carriageways, blue signs are used for the collector lanes and green signs for the express lanes. Unlike the collector lanes, which provide access to every interchange, the express lanes only provide direct access to a select few interchanges. Access between the two is provided by transfers, which are strategically placed to prevent disruptions caused by closely spaced interchanges.[37] The overall purpose of the collector-express system is to maximize traffic flow for both local and long-distance traffic. In addition, Highway?401 was equipped with a traffic camera system called COMPASS in early 1991.[38] Using closed-circuit television cameras, vehicle detection loops and LED changeable-message signs, COMPASS enables the MTO Traffic Operations Centre to obtain a real-time assessment of traffic conditions and alert drivers of collisions, congestion and construction.[39] The system currently stretches from the Highway?403?/ 410 interchange in Mississauga to Harwood Avenue in Ajax.[40]\\r\\nTwo sets of collector-express systems exist in the GTA. The first set is 6.6?km (4.1?mi) long and connects Highway?403, Highway?410 and Highway?427.[41] This system primarily serves to accommodate and organize various traffic movements from the Highway?403 / 410 and Highway?427 interchanges along Highway?401, replacing an earlier plan that would have run Highway?403 directly to Eglinton Avenue and the never-built Richview Expressway.[42] East of the interchange with Renforth Drive, the collector lanes diverge to become the on-ramps to Highway 427 northbound and southbound. The second 43.7?km (27.2?mi) system passes through the centre of Toronto and ends in Pickering to the east.[43] The 5?km (3.1?mi) gap between the two systems is a traffic bottleneck. However, the interchange cannot currently accommodate future widening of Highway?401.[9]\\r\\nHighway?401 widens to 18?lanes south of Toronto Pearson International Airport.[7] Progressing eastward, eight lanes are carried beneath the large spaghetti junction at Highway?427. The highway curves northeast and follows a power transmission corridor to Highway?409, which merges with the mainline and forms the collector lanes. It returns to its eastward route through Toronto, now carrying 12ÿ16?lanes of traffic on four carriageways.[35][44] Highway?401 is often congested in this section, with an average of 442,900?vehicles passing between Weston Road and Highway?400 per day as of 2008.[2][7] In spite of this congestion, it is the primary commuting route in Toronto; over 50?percent of vehicles bound for downtown Toronto use the highway.[45]\\r\\nEast of Highway?400 is The Basketweave, a criss-crossing transfer between the express and collectors carriageways,[35] beyond which is Yorkdale Centre. Twelve lanes pass beneath a complicated interchange with Allen Road, built to serve the cancelled Spadina Expressway. Further east, the highway crosses Hogg's Hollow, over the West Don River and Yonge Street in the centre of Toronto, the busiest multi-span bridge crossing in North America, surpassing the Brooklyn Bridge. It then crosses the East Don River and climbs toward the Don Valley Parkway, which provides access to downtown Toronto and Highway?404, which provides access to the suburbs to the north. Progressing eastward, the highway continues through mostly residential areas in Scarborough, eventually reaching the Rouge Valley on the city's eastern edge and crossing into Pickering.[35]\\r\\nWest of Pickering, Highway?401 again meets former Highway?2, which thereafter parallels it to the OntarioÿQuebec border.[16] As the highway approaches Brock Road in Pickering, the collector and express lanes converge, narrowing the 14-lane cross-section to 10, divided only at the centre.[44] It remains this width as it passes into Ajax,[35] before narrowing back to six lanes at Salem Road.[46] Planned expansions east of Salem to accommodate an interchange with Highway?412 will see the highway widened to ten lanes east to Brock Street.\\r\\nEast of Ajax, the highway passes through the second 3.5?km (2.1?mi) rural gap, and enters Whitby. The stretch of Highway?401 through Whitby and Oshawa features several structures completed during the initial construction of the highway in the 1940s.[9] Several of these structures are to be demolished, either due to their age, or to prepare for the planned widening of Highway?401 through this area.[47] A former Canadian National Railway overpass, which was fenced off but commonly used by pedestrians during Highway of Heroes repatriations, was demolished on the night of June 11, 2011. A second structure in Bowmanville was demolished during two overnight closures on July 9 and 16.[48] At Harmony Road, the suburban surroundings quickly transition to agricultural land. The highway curves around the south side of Bowmanville and travels towards Highway?35 and Highway?115.[31]\\r\\nFrom east of Highway?35 and Highway?115 to Cobourg, Highway?401 passes through a mix of agricultural land and forests, maintaining a straight course.[49] As the highway passes through Cobourg, it narrows to four lanes and the terrain becomes undulating, with the highway routed around hills and through valleys along the shores of Lake Ontario.[50] At Trenton, the highway crosses the Trent Canal and returns to an agricultural setting. It then crosses the Moira River as it goes through Belleville before heading eastward to Kingston.[12] The Kingston portion of the highway, originally named the Kingston-Bypass, was one of the first sections of the highway to be completed;[1] it is now mostly three lanes each way.\\r\\nEast of Kingston, the highway continues through a predominantly agricultural area alongside the Saint Lawrence River to Gananoque, where it splits with the Thousand Islands Parkway,[51] one of the original sections of the highway designated in 1952.[52] The current Highway?401 runs parallel to the parkway several kilometres inland from the river. The Canadian Shield, an ancient geological formation, appears through this heavily forested section of the highway. Highway?401 rejoins the Thousand Islands Parkway immediately southwest of Brockville, now heading northeast.[53]\\r\\nThe remainder of the highway runs parallel to the former Highway?2 along the shore of the Saint Lawrence River within the Saint Lawrence Valley. Northeast of Brockville is the interchange with Highway?416, which heads north to Ottawa.[54] At the OntarioÿQuebec border, Highway?401 becomes Autoroute?20 and continues to Montreal.[55]\\r\\nThe MTO publishes yearly traffic volume data for provincial highways, expressed as an average daily vehicle count over the span of a year (AADT).[56] The table below compares the AADT at several locations along Highway?401 using data from 1969, 1988 and 2008.\\r\\nHighway?401's history predates its designation by over two decades. As automobile use in southern Ontario grew in the early 20th century, road design and construction advanced significantly. Following frequent erosion of Lake Shore Road, then macadamized,[59] a concrete road known as the TorontoÿHamilton Highway was proposed in January 1914. Construction began on November 8 of that year, following the onset of World War I.[60][61] The highway was designed to run along the lake shore, instead of Dundas Street to the north, because the numerous hills encountered along Dundas would have increased costs without improving accessibility. Middle Road, a dirt lane named because of its position between the two, was not considered since Lake Shore and Dundas were both overcrowded and in need of serious repairs.[62] The road was formally opened on November 24, 1917,[59][60] 5.5?m (18?ft) wide and nearly 64?km (40?mi) long. It was the first concrete road in Ontario, as well as one of the longest stretches of concrete road between two cities in the world.[63]\\r\\nOver the next decade, vehicle usage increased substantially, and by 1920 Lakeshore Road was again congested, particularly during weekends.[64] In response, the Department of Highways examined improving another road between Toronto and Hamilton. The road was to be more than twice the width of Lakeshore Road at 12?m (39?ft) and would carry two lanes of traffic in either direction.[65] Construction on what was then known as the Queen Street Extension west of Toronto began in early 1931.[66]\\r\\nBefore the highway could be completed, Thomas McQuesten was appointed the new minister of the Department of Highways, with Robert Melville Smith as deputy minister, following the 1934 provincial elections.[9] Smith, inspired by the German autobahnsnew \\"dual-lane divided highways\\"modified the design for Ontario roads,[67] and McQuesten ordered that the Middle Road be converted into this new form of highway.[68][69][70] A 40?m (130?ft) right-of-way was purchased along the Middle Road and construction began to convert the existing sections to a divided highway. Work also began on Canada's first interchange at Highway?10.[65]\\r\\nBeginning in 1935, McQuesten applied the concept of a dual-highway to several projects along Highway?2, including along Kingston Road in Scarborough Township.[9][71] When widening in Scarborough reached the Highland Creek ravine in 1936, the Department of Highways began construction on a new bridge over the large valley, bypassing the former alignment around West Hill.[72] From here the highway was constructed on a new alignment to Oshawa, avoiding construction on the congested Highway?2.[8] As grading and bridge construction neared completion on the new highway between West Hill and Oshawa in September 1939, World War II broke out and gradually tax revenues were re-allocated from highway construction to the war effort.[9]\\r\\nAt the same time, between September 6 and 8, 1939, the Ontario Good Roads Association Conference was held at Bigwin Inn, near Huntsville,[73] drawing highway engineers from across North America to discuss the new concept of \\"Dual Highways\\". On the first day of the convention, McQuesten announced his vision of the freeway: an uninterrupted drive through the scenic regions of Ontario, discouraging local business and local traffic from accessing the highway except at infrequent controlled-access points.[74] It was announced in the days thereafter that this concept would be applied to a new \\"trans-provincial expressway\\", running from Windsor to the OntarioÿQuebec border.[75]\\r\\nHighway engineers evaluated factors such as grading, curve radius and the narrow median used along the Middle Road (which was inaugurated on August 23, 1940, as the Queen Elizabeth Way),[76] and began to plan the course of a new dual highway mostly parallel to Highway?2, with precedence given to areas most hampered by congestion. Unlike the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW), this highway would not be built along an existing road, but rather on a new right-of-way, avoiding the need to provide access to properties.[9][74]\\r\\nAlong with immense improvements to machinery and construction techniques over its six-year course, the war provided planners an opportunity to conduct a survey of 375,000?drivers, asking them about their preferred route to travel to their destination. Using this information, a course was plotted from Windsor to Quebec, bypassing all towns along the way.[8][77]\\r\\nHighway?2S (S for Scenic), was the first completed section of new roadway. Built to connect with the Thousand Islands Bridge at Ivy Lea and opened as a gravel road in late 1941 or early 1942,[78] the road followed the shore of the Saint Lawrence River and connected with the western end of the twinned Highway?2 near Brockville.[16] In addition, the highway between Highland Creek and Oshawa was opened as a gravel-surfaced road in May 1942.[79]\\r\\nFollowing the war, construction resumed on roadways throughout Ontario. The expressway between Highland Creek and Oshawa was completed in December 1947,[8] while other sections languished. The TorontoÿBarrie Highway was the primary focus of the Department of Highways at the time, and the onset of the Korean War in 1950 stalled construction again. Despite the delays, highway minister George Doucett officially announced the plans for construction of the new trans-provincial expressway that year, with the Toronto to Oshawa expressway serving as a model for the design.[9] Work on the most important link, the Toronto Bypass, began in 1951,[9] but it would not open with that name.\\r\\nIn July 1952 (possibly July 1, the same day Highway?400 was numbered),[a][52] the Highland Creek to Oshawa expressway and Highway?2S were designated Controlled-Access Highway No?401,[8] a move scorned by one critic because of the lack of thought into the numbered name.[80] Construction was completed for several sections of the Toronto Bypass; between Highway?400 and Dufferin Street in August, west to Weston Road in September, east to Bathurst Street in October and finally to Yonge Street in December.[1] Extensions east and west began in 1953; the eastern extension to Bayview Avenue would open in April 1955,[1] the western extension was delayed by the damage caused by Hurricane Hazel on October 15, 1954, which nearly destroyed the new bridge over the Humber River. The reconstruction would take until July 8, 1955,[81] and the highway was opened between Weston and Highway?27 in September 1955.[1]\\r\\nThe entire bypass, including the widening of Highway?27 into an expressway south of Highway?401,[8][82] was completed in August 1956.[1][8] Upon its opening, the bypass was described by one reporter as \\"a motorist's dream\\" providing \\"some of the most soothing scenery in the Metropolitan area\\". The reporter continued, with regard to the eastern section through Scarborough, that it \\"winds smoothly through pastures across streams and rivers, and beside green thickets. It seems a long way from the big city.\\"[8] By 1959 however, the bypass was a lineup of cars, as 85,000?drivers crowded the roadway, designed to handle a maximum of 48,000?vehicles, on a daily basis.[8] Motorists found the new road to be a convenient way of travelling across Toronto; this convenience helped influence the suburban shift in the city and continues to be a driving force of urban sprawl today.[52]\\r\\nMeanwhile, beyond Toronto, the highway was being built in a patchwork fashion, focusing on congested areas first.[9] Construction west from Highway?27 began in late 1954,[83] as did the Kingston Bypass in Eastern Ontario.[84] Work began to connect the latter with the Scenic Highway in 1955.[83] After the 1954 New York State Thruway opened from Buffalo to New York City,[85] Michigan officials encouraged Ontario to bypass Highway 3 as the most direct path from Detroit to Buffalo.[86] By 1956, construction had begun on a segment between Highway?4 in London and Highway?2 in Woodstock, as well as on the section between Windsor and Tilbury.[87]\\r\\nIn 1958, a section bypassing Morrisburg was opened to accommodate traffic displaced from a portion of Highway?2 through The Lost Villages of the Saint Lawrence Seaway.[88] Highway 2 would ultimately be reopened on a new alignment which followed the CN rail right-of-way.\\r\\nBy the end of 1960, the Toronto section of the highway was extended both eastwards and westwards: first, to the east between Newcastle and Port Hope on June 30, then later to the west between Highway?25 in Milton and Highway?8 south of Kitchener on November 17.[1] By mid-1961, the section between Brighton and Marysville had opened.[89] The gap to the east, from Highway?28 in Port Hope to Highway?30 in Brighton was opened on July 20, 1961.[90]\\r\\nThe gap between Woodstock and Kitchener was completed on November 9, 1961, while the gap between Tilbury and London was completed two lanes at a time; the northbound lanes on October 22, 1963, the southbound on July 20, 1965.[1] The gap between Marysville and Kingston was opened by 1962.[89] The final sections, from west of Cornwall to Lancaster, were opened between 1962 and 1964;[89][91] two lanes opened to Lancaster on September 11, 1962, but the other two were not completed until July 31, 1964. The last segment, to the OntarioÿQuebec border, was opened on November 10, 1964.[1] Finally, on October 11, 1968, the Thousand Islands Bypass opened.[8] This final piece was commemorated with a plaque to signify the completion of Highway?401.[9]\\r\\nIn Toronto, engineers and surveyors were examining the four-lane bypass, while planners set about designing a way to handle the commuter highway. In 1963, transportation minister Charles MacNaughton announced the widening of Highway?401 in Toronto from four to a minimum of 12?lanes between Islington Avenue and Markham Road. The design was taken from the Dan Ryan Expressway in Chicago, which was widened into a similar configuration around the same time.[8] Construction began immediately. While the plan initially called for construction to end in 1967, it continued for nearly a decade. At least four lanes were always open during the large reconstruction project, which included complex new interchanges at Highway?27, Highway?400, the planned Spadina Expressway and the Don Valley Parkway. The system was completed in 1972, along with the Highway?27 (renamed Highway?427) bypass between the QEW and Pearson Airport. Most of the interchanges in Toronto were reconstructed as partial cloverleafs and a continuous lighting system was installed.[9]\\r\\nOn January 11, 1965, at the dinner celebration of Sir John A. Macdonald's 150th birthday, the Premier of Ontario John Robarts designated Highway?401 the MacdonaldÿCartier Freeway to honour Macdonald and George-tienne Cartier, two of Canada's Fathers of Confederation.[92][93] Unlike other names later applied to the highway, the MacdonaldÿCartier Freeway designation covers the entire length of Highway?401. Signs designating the freeway and shields with the letters 'M-C' were installed, but these had been removed by 1997.[94] In 2003, 38?years after Robarts' naming of the highway, a Member of Provincial Parliament attempted to get the Macdonald-Cartier Freeway highway name enshrined into law; the bill only passed first reading and was not enacted.[95]\\r\\nIn the 1970s, Highway?401 was widened to six lanes in Durham, but otherwise saw little improvement.[9] The 1980s saw more sections widened, as well as a new collector-express system between Highway?403 / 410 and Highway?427 completed in mid-1985.[96] Plans were made to extend the eastern system from Neilson Road to Brock Road in Pickering in the late 1980s,[97] but took over a decade to reach fruition by 2000.[98][99] This was followed shortly thereafter by the widening of the highway through Ajax and a new interchange at Pickering Beach Road (renamed Salem Road) and Stevenson Road.[100]\\r\\nThe 1990s also saw the first step in widening the highway to six lanes from Toronto to London.[101] A project in the mid-1990s brought the highway up to a minimum of six lanes between Highway?8 in Kitchener and Highway?35 / 115 in Newcastle.[102] Other projects prepared sections for eventual widening.[103]\\r\\nIn 1993, the stretch of Highway?401 eastbound near Milton and westbound near Whitby had chevrons painted in each lane in an effort to reduce tailgating, a concept borrowed from France and Britain. Signs advised motorists to keep at least two chevrons apart, in essence warning them not to follow too closely.[104] Some of these chevrons remain intact in the westbound lanes in Whitby, though the signs stating their use have since been removed.[105]\\r\\nBeginning in 1998, several projects were initiated on Highway?401 within Toronto. These included the addition of one lane through the Highway?427 interchange in 2005, as well as the resurfacing of the pavement through the city.[6]\\r\\nBetween June 1990 and 1998, Highway?401 and Interstate?75 were used for a pilot project named Advantage I-75 to test the reliability and versatility of an automated tracking system for transport trucks. Termed MACS for Mainline Automated Clearance System, it would allow a truck to travel from Florida to Ontario without a second inspection.[106] MACS was initially tested out at two truck inspection stations in Kentucky, with transponders installed in 220?trucks. Exact time, date, location, weight and axle data were logged as a truck approached an equipped station.[107] Following initial tests, MACS was deployed at every inspection station along I-75 from Miami to Detroit and along Highway?401 from Windsor to Belleville in 1994.[106] The project demonstrated the effectiveness of electronic systems in enforcing freight restrictions without delaying vehicles, while alleviating security fears that such systems could be easily compromised. The concept has since been applied to many parts of Canada, including Highway?407's electronic tolling system.[108]\\r\\nThe section of Highway?401 between Windsor and London has often been referred to as Carnage Alley, in reference to the numerous crashes that have occurred throughout its history. The term became more commonplace following several deadly pileups during the 1990s.[9] The narrow and open grass median was an ineffective obstacle in preventing cross-median collisions. The soft shoulders consisted of gravel with a sharp slope which was blamed for facilitating vehicle rollovers.[109] The nature of that section of highway, described as largely a straight road with a featureless agricultural landscape, was said to make drivers feel less involved and lose focus on the road. In winter, the area between Woodstock and Chatham is also subject to sudden snow squalls from lake-effect snow.[110] Several collisions have resulted from motorists deviating from their lane and losing control of their vehicles.[109][111]\\r\\nVarious other names, including The Killer Highway circulated for a time,[112] but Carnage Alley became predominant following an 87-vehicle pile-up on September 3, 1999 (the start of Labour Day weekend), the worst in Canadian history, that resulted in eight deaths and 45?injured individuals.[113]\\r\\nOnly a few days prior, then-Transportation Minister David Turnbull had deemed the highway \\"pleasant\\" to drive.[114] On the morning of September 3, the local weather station reported clear conditions due to a malfunction,[113] while a thick layer of fog rolled onto the highway. Dozens of vehicles including several semi-trailers quickly crashed into each other shortly after 8?a.m., one following another in the dense fog, and the accumulating wreckage caught traffic travelling in the opposite direction.[115][116] Immediately following the crash, the MTO installed paved shoulders with rumble strips[117] and funded additional police to patrol the highway, a move criticized as being insufficient.[118]\\r\\nBeginning in 2004, 46?km (29?mi) of the highway was widened from four asphalt lanes to six concrete lanes, paved shoulders were added, a concrete Ontario Tall Wall median was installed,[119] which was the solution that the Canadian Automobile Association promoted in 1999.[109] Interchanges were improved and signage was upgraded as part of a five-phase project to improve Highway?401 from Highway?3 in Windsor to Essex County Road?42 (formerly Highway?2) on the western edge of Tilbury.[24]\\r\\nOn August 24, 2007, the MTO announced that the stretch of Highway?401 between Glen Miller Road in Trenton and the intersection of the Don Valley Parkway and Highway?404 in Toronto would bear the additional name Highway of Heroes (French: Autoroute des hros), in honour of Canadian soldiers who have died,[120] though Highway?401 in its entirety remains designated as the MacdonaldÿCartier Freeway.[121] This length of the highway is often travelled by a convoy of vehicles carrying a fallen soldier's body, with his or her family, from CFB Trenton to the coroner's office at the Centre for Forensic Sciences in Toronto. Since 2002, when the first fallen Canadian soldiers were repatriated from Afghanistan, crowds have lined the overpasses to pay their respects as convoys pass.[122]\\r\\nThe origin of the name can be traced to an article in the Toronto Sun on June 23, 2007, by columnist Joe Warmington, in which he interviewed Northumberland photographer Pete Fisher. Fisher, along with Bob Jenkins, an emergency dispatcher, were responsible for organizing the first bridge salutes following the loss of four soldiers on April 18, 2002.[123] Warmington described the gathering of crowds on overpasses to welcome fallen soldiers as a \\"highway of heroes phenomena\\".[124] This led a Cramahe Township volunteer firefighter to contact Fisher on July 10 about starting a petition, leading Fisher to publish an article which was posted to the Northumberland Today website.[125] The online article eventually caught the attention of London resident Jay Forbes. Forbes began a petition, which received over 20,000?signatures[120] before being brought to the Minister of Transportation on August 22.[126] Following the announcement on August 24, the provincial government and MTO set out to design new signs. The signs were erected and unveiled on September 7,[121] and include a smaller reassurance marker (shield), as well as a larger billboard version.[127]\\r\\nOn August 10, 2008, following a series of explosions at a propane facility in Toronto, Highway?401 was closed between Highway?400 and Highway?404 as a precautionary measure, the largest closure of the highway in its history.[128] The highway remained closed until 8?p.m., though several exits near the blast remained closed thereafter.[129][130]\\r\\nBetween 2006 and 2008, Highway?401 was widened from four to six lanes between Highway?402 and Wellington Road in London. This included replacing the original Wellington Road overpass.[24] In Oshawa, Exit?416 (Park Road) was replaced by a new interchange at Exit?415 (Stevenson Road). The contract, which began September 7, 2005, included the interchange and the resurfacing of 23.4?km (14.5?mi) of the highway between Oshawa and Highway?35?/ Highway?115.[131] The westbound ramps were opened in mid-September 2007[132] and the eastbound ramps in mid-2009. The resurfacing was completed mid-2010.[131]\\r\\nIn November 2010, the widening of Highway?401 from four to six lanes between Woodstock and Kitchener was completed after many years of planning and construction.[133] The project included the installation of a tall-wall median barrier, straightening curves and adding additional interchanges on the freeway, allowing it to be easily vacated in an emergency event.[134]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, a joint announcement by the federal government of the United States and Government of Canada confirmed that a new border crossing would be constructed between Detroit and Windsor. The Detroit River International Crossing (DRIC) was formed as a bi-national committee to manage the project.[135] The MTO took advantage of this opportunity to extend Highway?401 to the CanadaÿUS border and began an environmental impact assessment on the entire project in late 2005.[135] The City of Windsor also hired New York traffic consultant Sam Schwartz to design a parkway to the border. Schwartz's proposal would eventually inspire the DRIC's own design, but his route was not chosen, with the DRIC opting instead to take a northern route.[136] On February 8, 2008, the MTO announced that it had begun purchasing property south of the E.C. Row Expressway, upsetting many area residents who had purchased properties in the years prior.[137][138]\\r\\nOn March 3, 2008, the Michigan Department of Transportation and the MTO (in partnership with Transport Canada, the Federal Highway Administration of the United States and the Detroit River International Crossing group) completed a joint assessment on the soils along the Detroit River and determined that they could indeed support the weight of a new bridge; the stability of the underlying soil and clay and the impact of the nearby Windsor Salt Mine had caused concern for all parties involved in the project.[139]\\r\\nDespite protest from area residents,[140] as well as a dismissed lawsuit from Ambassador Bridge owner Matty Moroun,[141][142] it was announced on May 1, 2008, that a preferred route had been selected and that the new route would be named the WindsorÿEssex Parkway.[14] The new parkway is below-grade and has six through-lanes. It follows (but does not replace) Talbot Road and Huron Church Road from a new interchange at the former end of Highway?401 to the E.?C. Row Expressway, where it runs concurrently westward for 2?km (1.2?mi). From there, it turns northwest and follows a new alignment to the border.[143] Initial construction of a noise barrier from North Talbot Road to Howard Avenue began in March 2010; full construction began on August 19, 2011.[144]\\r\\nOn November 28, 2012, the Ministry of Transportation announced that a Federal Order in Council was passed to change the name of the parkway to the Right Honourable Herb Gray Parkway, after the long-time Windsor MP.[145] In early 2015, it was announced that the parkway would open to traffic between Highway?3 and Labelle Street (near the E. C. Row Expressway) in the spring;[146] an 8-kilometre (5?mi) section was opened to traffic on June?28, extending Highway?401 as far west as the E. C. Row Expressway. It was the first new segment of the highway to be opened since the Thousand Islands Bypass in 1968.[147] The stretch to Ojibway Parkway was opened on November?21,[148] completing the parkway as far as the planned bridge approach and border plaza.[149] Construction on projects related to the Gordie Howe International Bridge began in 2015 with an initial completion date in 2019ÿ20.[150] Construction of the bridge itself is expected to start in 2018 after a project contractor is selected in 2017. An updated completion date would be in or after 2022.[151]\\r\\nIn 2007 Minister of Transportation Donna Cansfield commented that the MTO intends to widen all of the remaining four-lane sections to a minimum of six. With no dates set for construction or completion, this is a tentative announcement for the long-term future.[152]\\r\\nIn Southwestern Ontario, several improvements are under way to provide six lanes on Highway 401 from Windsor to Toronto,[152] in response to the Carnage Alley pile-up in 1999.[119][153] West of Essex County Road 42 on the west of Tilbury, the highway has been widened to six lanes with a concrete divider in anticipation of the WindsorÿEssex Parkway.[14][154] Between Tilbury and Highway?402, the highway remains four lanes wide with a grass median. The widening and upgrading of this section is in the planning stages, with construction possibly beginning in 2017 and lasting for several years. Several interchanges are slated to be upgraded as part of this construction.[155]\\r\\nWithin the London area, traffic volumes are expected to increase considerably, leading to poor highway conditions. The province has put in place an extensive plan to widen and reconstruct the London corridor between 2006 and 2021.[156] This included building a new interchange with Wonderland Road which opened in November 2015 to help improve access to Highway?401 westbound from the city's southwest end and involved replacing the Westminster Drive overpass to allow the highway to be widened.[157] The Westminster Drive overpass was demolished on July 5, 2014.[158] This project will coincide with reconstructing the outdated cloverleaf interchange at Colonel Talbot Road[159] and widening Highway?401 from four to six lanes between Highway?4 and Highway?402. These projects start in 2017.[160][161][162] The MTO is also planning on widening Highway?401 from six to eight lanes through part of the London corridor.[163][164]\\r\\nLong-term plans call for Highway?401 in the Waterloo region to be widened to eight to ten lanes as well.[165] Work began on June?8, 2015 to widen the highway from six to ten lanes between Highway?8 and Hespeler Road in Cambridge. The interchange between Highway?401 and Highway?8 (King Street) is to be reconstructed to make it free-flowing for all directions of travel.[166][167]\\r\\nIn its 2007 plan for southern Ontario, the MTO announced long-term plans to create high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes from Mississauga Road west to Milton;[168] these plans have since been expanded in scope to as far west as Hespeler Road in Cambridge.[169]\\r\\nConstruction recently completed widening Highway?401 to a collector-express system from Highway?403 and Highway?410 west to Hurontario Street, a distance of 2.8?km (1.7?mi).[170] Plans have been unveiled to lengthen the Mavis Road overpass and add ramps to the 401/403/410 interchange to prepare for the 'ultimate widening' of Highway 401 between the Credit River and Highway 410.[171]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin Toronto, some projects have been completed during overnight construction projects, including the widening and rehabilitation of the Hogg's Hollow bridge,[172] the replacement of the original gantries throughout the collector-express system,[173] and reconstructing the Highway?401 / 400 interchange.[174]\\r\\nCurrent expansion plans in Durham include the construction of two new freeways north from Highway?401. Highway?412 is directly east of Lakeridge Road,[175] while Highway?418 will lie to the east of Courtice Road.[176] Alongside the extension of Highway?407, Highway?401 is being widened to 12?lanes, forming an extension to the current collector-express system, from its current end at Brock Road in Pickering to Brock Street in Whitby. In addition, a partial interchange is being constructed at Lakeridge Road, with westbound entrance and eastbound exit ramps. In order to accommodate the ramps for Highway?412, the highway is being shifted north at the interchange, currently under construction.[177] Long-term plans also call for HOV lanes to run from Brock Road to Harmony Road, though no planning has commenced.[168] However, there has been an environmental assessment on widening highway 401, extending the collector-express system east towards Salem Road in Ajax and to 10 lanes from Brock Street in Whitby, to Courtice Road in the Clarington township. The assessment was completed in March 2015.[178]\\r\\nAll the original World War II era overpasses dating back in the 1940s and 1950s built between Whitby and Oshawa will gradually be replaced with new overpasses as part of modern highway safety standards and to allow highway widening sometime in the future.[179]\\r\\nEast of Durham, the MTO is planning to widen parts of Highway?401 to six lanes.[152] Preliminary work includes the widening of the bridge over the Trent River in Trenton,[180] as well as the realignment of some roads alongside the highway.[181] By 2012, the highway was widened to six lanes for 9?km (5.6?mi) through Kingston between exits 611 and 619.[58] Construction began in 2014 to expand the highway to six lanes through Cobourg.[182] This was completed in the summer of 2017.\\r\\nHighway?401 features 19?service centres controlled by the MTO. These service centres were announced in 1961 following public outcry over the lack of rest stops. They provide a place to park, rest, eat and refuel 24 hours a day.[8]\\r\\nThe centres were originally leased to and operated by several major gasoline distributors; however, those companies have chosen not to renew their leases as the terms end. In response, the MTO put the operation of the full network of service centres out for tender, resulting in a 50-year lease with Host Kilmer Service Centres, a joint venture between hospitality company HMSHost (a subsidiary of Autogrill) and Larry Tanenbaum's investment company Kilmer van Nostrand, which operates the rest areas under the ONroute brand.[183]\\r\\nSeventeen of the centres along Highway?401 have been reconstructed entirely. Two centres that were rebuilt in the late 1990s, specifically Newcastle and Ingersoll, will not be redeveloped at this time. Work on 15 of the 17?service centres to be reconstructed began in late 2009 or early 2010. The new service centres, opening in phases beginning in July 2010, feature a Canadian Tire gas station, an HMSHost-operated convenience store known as \\"The Market\\", as well as fast food brands such as Tim Hortons, A&W, Pizza Pizza, Extreme Pita, KFC, Taco Bell, Big Smoke Burger and Burger King.[184]\\r\\nCambridge North reopened June 25, 2013; Cambridge South reopened July 23, 2013.[190]\\r\\nThe following table lists the major junctions along Highway 401, as noted by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario.[2]?\\r\\nRoute map: Google","input":"What is the widest highway in north america?"},{"output":"Iggle Piggle","context":"In the Night Garden... is a BBC children's television series, aimed at children aged from one to six years old.[2] It is produced by Ragdoll Productions. Andrew Davenport created, wrote, and composed the title theme and incidental music for all 100 episodes.[3][4] It was produced by Davenport and Anne Wood, the team that also co-created Teletubbies. The programme is narrated by Derek Jacobi. It is filmed mostly in live action, and features a mix of actors in costume, puppetry and computer animation. The characters include Iggle Piggle, Makka Pakka, Upsy Daisy, the Tombliboos, the Pontipines / the Wottingers, the Haahoos, the Ninky Nonk and the Pinky Ponk.\\r\\nThe series was announced in 000000002006-10-01-0000October 2006, and twenty episodes were first broadcast in 000000002007-03-19-000019 March 2007. Two series were made, with 100 episodes in all. The BBC confirmed in 2010 that it would not be commissioning another series.[5] The show's budget was S14.5 million. [6]\\r\\nThe programme's creators have said that it is designed to relax and entertain its intended audience of one to six-year-olds.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe programme features a large cast of colourful characters with unusual names who live in a magical forest scattered with large daisies and brightly coloured pompom flowers. The characters mostly speak short, repetitive phrases and each has their own special song and dance. The garden is a sunny, colourful environment and the music is jaunty and music box-like. Producer Anne Wood said:\\r\\nEach episode starts with a different child in bed, while the narrator introduces the episode. The scene cuts to Iggle Piggle, in his boat, travelling to the Night Garden. Then the camera pans up to the sky and zooms in, followed by blooming flowers. After the title appears under a hedge, either the Ninky Nonk or the Pinky Ponk appears. The episodes end with one character receiving a bedtime story, which is generated by the magical gazebo that sits at the centre of the Night Garden. This story is a summary of the plot of the episode. Sometimes the characters all dance together under the Gazebo.\\r\\nIggle Piggle does not go to sleep, and his goodbye sequence (\\"Iggle Piggle's not in bed!\\" ... \\"Squeak!\\" ... \\"Don't worry, Iggle Piggle! It's time to go\\") rounds off the programme. The Night Garden retreats into the night sky and Iggle Piggle is seen asleep on his boat as the end credits roll.\\r\\nIn the Night Garden... is intended to help children relax and achieve calming relationships with parents. Wood states: \\"We became very aware of the anxiety surrounding the care of young children which manifested itself in all kind of directions; but the one big subject that came up again and again was bedtime. It's the classic time for tension between children who want to stay up and parents who want them to go to bed... so this is a programme about calming things down whereas most children's TV is about getting everything up.\\"[7]\\r\\nIn 2007[8] and 2008,[9] the show won the Children's BAFTA for \\"Pre-school live action,\\" as well as being nominated in 2009.[10]\\r\\nIgglepiggle (played by Nick Kellington) is a blue teddy bear-like doll with a bean-shaped head and a sideways red mohawk. He always carries his red blanket, and tends to fall flat on his back when surprised. He is the main character of the show. He arrives at the beginning and leaves the Night Garden at the end of each episode in a boat, for which the blanket doubles as a sail. Iggle Piggle has a bell in his left foot, a squeaker in his tummy, and a rattle in his left hand. His best friends in the garden are Upsy Daisy and Makka Pakka. He is the only character not to sleep in the Night Garden (with one exception when he fell asleep on Upsy Daisy's special bed), because sometimes he needs to find his boat; he sleeps on his boat instead of in a bed. He is the only character to walk on the Stepping Stone Path. He was first featured in the episode \\"Makka Pakka Washes Faces\\". Sometimes Iggle Piggle has a red blanket in the boat.\\r\\nUpsy Daisy (played by Rebecca Hyland) is similar to a rag doll, with a brown complexion, a chime in her tummy, and brightly coloured clothes. She likes skipping through the Garden and blowing kisses to the other characters or to the audience. She often hugs and kisses other characters, particularly Iggle Piggle. Her catchphrases are \\"Upsy Daisy,\\" and the more emphatic \\"Daisy Doo!\\", and she also says \\"Pip pip onk onk!\\", her way of saying goodbye. Her hair stands on end when excited or surprised, and her skirt inflates to a tutu when she dances or pulls the ripcord on her waist. She, along with Iggle Piggle were first featured in the episode \\"Makka Pakka Washes Faces\\".\\r\\nMakka Pakka (played by Justyn Towler) is a beige, small, round-bodied doll. He has three rounded protuberances on his head, ears and back to represent stones that he uses to make into piles. He lives in a cave and likes cleaning things, such as his collection of stacking stones, and sometimes the other characters. Makka Pakka often stacks freshly cleaned stones into piles resembling his head and body. He sleeps on a stone bed, often cuddling a stone. He travels around the garden riding his trolley, the Og-Pog, which carries his sponge, soap, orange trumpet, and a bellows-like apparatus called Uff-Uff which he uses to dry items after cleaning them. His house is approached by a stone-walled ditch, as his home is half buried in the ground. He says his own name and the phrase \\"Mikka makka moo\\" when he is happy, as well as the names of the Og-Pog and the Uff-Uff, and other phrases from his song such as \\"agga pang\\" (his soap and sponge), \\"hum dum\\" (his trumpet), and \\"ing ang oo\\". Like Upsy Daisy and the Tombliboos, he also uses a phrase meaning \\"goodbye\\", represented in publications as \\"pip pip onk onk\\". He, along with Iggle Piggle and Upsy Daisy were first featured in the episode \\"Makka Pakka Washes Faces\\". As Makka Pakka is smaller than the other characters, he is filmed on another identical set (or garden), and where he appears with other characters, two scenes are shot in parallel and he is filmed far away, whilst the other costumed characters are filmed close up.\\r\\nThe Tombliboos ÿ Unn (Andy Wareham), Ooo (Holly Denoon/Isaac Blake), and Eee (Elisa Laghi) ÿ are dressed in costumes with stripes and spots: red and green (Unn), brown and pink (Ooo), and pink and yellow (Eee). Their names reflect phonetically how a young child might count to three, and the Tombliboos always appear in this order by saying their names. They live among the branches of a bush, on a series of platforms connected by stairs and chutes. The Tombliboos enjoy playing the drums and piano, although not with any particular musical prowess, and they also play with large blocks. Their trousers (which fall down unexpectedly) are often seen hanging on the washing line outside their home, and they usually take them down from the line and put them on before going on an adventure. They are sometimes seen brushing their teeth before bed. Tombliboos enjoy kissing each other whilst cuddling and reciting their names. They also have a song about staying together, which consists of them singing \\"Tombliboo, Tombliboo, Unn, Ooo, Eee!\\" over and over again. Tombliboo Eee is female and is shorter and smaller than Ooo and Unn. The Tombliboos, along with Iggle Piggle, Upsy Daisy and Makka Pakka were first featured in the episode \\"Makka Pakka Washes Faces\\".\\r\\nThe Pontipines (red) and The Wottingers (blue) are two families of ten tiny creatures (a mother and a father, plus four boys and four girls) similar to peg dolls. They live in a semidetached house at the foot of a tree. The Pontipines appear in most episodes, while appearances by the Wottingers, are rare. The Pontipines all dress in a very similar fashion to each other, as do the Wottingers. Each family sleeps in one room, their beds next to each other in rows. The Pontipines enter their home by flying down the chimney or going through the front door. They have no feet. The Pontipines enter the Pinky Ponk through a different door from all the other characters, and stay on a separate deck. The Pontipines and the Wottingers appear to be animated using stop motion, but in reality they were hand puppets on sticks that were moved in real time by a puppeteer, with a strobe effect applied in post-production to give the illusion of stop motion animation. They constantly chatter, making high-pitched \\"mi-mi-mi\\" sounds and \\"farting\\" noises. Mr Pontipine's moustache occasionally flies off his face and settles on Mrs Pontipine. The adult Pontipines and the adult Wottingers wear large hats. Mrs Pontipine carries a pair of binoculars around her neck at all times, which she uses to look for her children when they get lost. The Wottingers are similar in design to the Pontipines, though not identical; they can be glimpsed in the general dance sequences, but are not seen going to bed. The Pontipines, along with Iggle Piggle, Upsy Daisy, Makka Pakka and the Tombliboos were first featured in the 1st episode \\"Makka Pakka Washes Faces\\" and the Wottingers first appeared in the episode \\"The Pontipine Children in the Tombliboo Trousers\\".\\r\\nThe Haahoos are five very large inflatable pillow-like creatures of various shapes and colours with eyes and smiling mouths. They move slowly around the garden making deep springy sounds (\\"boing, boing\\"). The Haahoos appear behind the gazebo during general dance sequences, and are also seen going to sleep, closing their eyes and deflating slightly. They come in the shape of a flower, an X, a star, a circle and a figure of 8. They were first featured in the episode \\"The Tombliboos' Waving Game\\".\\r\\nThe Tittifers are CGI enhanced tropical birds with their own unique songs. There are four small blue tittifers (long-tailed finches), three larger pink ones (hoopoes), two big green ones (white-cheeked turacos) and one Channel-billed toucan with a huge purple beak. They usually sing between segments, and when they sing together, near the end, it is time to sleep. They, along with Iggle Piggle, Upsy Daisy, Makka Pakka, the Tombliboos and the Pontipines were first featured in the episode \\"Makka Pakka Washes Faces\\".\\r\\nThe Ninky Nonk is a train of five differently sized and shaped carriages. Its size is non-euclidean: exterior shots of the moving Ninky Nonk show a toy-sized train, quite small compared to the main characters and scenery, while interiors and static exterior shots are done on sets or with life-sized models so that the main characters can easily fit inside. When it stops or starts, the seat-belted passengers jerk sharply in their seats. A range of bells and klaxons warn everyone inside. The Ninky Nonk can drive up and down trees and upside-down along branches. Like the other characters, it goes to sleep. The engine is banana-shaped with a green flashing light on top, and is followed by a green spheroidal carriage used by the Tombliboos, a tiny house-like carriage used by the Pontipines, a blue rectangular carriage with a flashing light used by Upsy Daisy, and a tall rounded single-seater carriage used by Igglepiggle. It was first featured in the episode \\"Everybody, All Aboard the Ninky Nonk\\". All the above characters are played by actors in costumes just like the Teletubbies.\\r\\nThe Pinky Ponk is an airship, speckled with many slowly waving fins and several small propellers that can spin fast, plus a large propeller at the rear that always turns very gently. The characters often use it to travel around the forest, and during their journey are able to drink \\"Pinky Ponk juice\\" which is dispensed in \\"sippy cups\\". It comes in several colours. If drunk too much, you can feel ill, as demonstrated by Tombliboo Ooo.[11] As well as whirrings and clankings, and a sporadic honking sound from the \\"Ponk light\\" at the front, the Pinky Ponk makes flatulent noises.[12] Like the Ninky Nonk, the Pinky Ponk does not conform to euclidean geometry: exterior shots are chroma keyed model shots showing a model smaller than the main characters, while interior ones shots produced on a set into which they can fit. It has two doors, one for the costumed characters and the other for the tiny characters. One table has three seats (for the Tombliboos), another has two seats (for Iggle Piggle and Upsy Daisy), and the third has one seat (for Makka Pakka). The Pontipines take a table with no seats in a small room. It also has a habit of crashing into tree trunks, thus sounding the \\"Ponk Alert\\" (repeated honking and flashing of the \\"Ponk Light\\" and interior lights flashing and making noises.) This is a warning for all the passengers to take their seats and brace. Sometimes, the Pinky Ponk rocks during the \\"Ponk Alert\\", causing the passengers and their tables and chairs to slide from one end to the other. It, along with the Haahoos was first featured in the episode \\"The Tombliboos' Waving Game\\".\\r\\nThe Ball is a colourful living ball that plays with the Night Garden characters. It was first featured in the episode \\"The Ball\\".\\r\\nThe Bed is Upsy Daisy's specially private bed. She moves it around the Night Garden, with its ripcord, around the garden; sometimes she has to catch the Bed, before it runs away. It was first featured in the episode \\"Makka Pakka's Trumpet Makes a Funny Noise\\".\\r\\nThe Tiddle is a small geyser-like fountain. It appears in any place of the Night Garden when someone stomps his/her feet three times. It disappears when someone stomps one of his/her feet once. It was featured in the episode \\"Igglepiggle's Tiddle\\".\\r\\nThe Trubliphones are a sort of telephone scattered randomly throughout the garden. The characters can use them to communicate with one another. They were first featured in the episode \\"Upsy Daisy's Big Loud Sing Song\\".\\r\\nThe Stepping Stone Path is where Igglepiggle lives, for a vacation in the Night Garden. It leads to the Gazebo at the beginning and end of an episode.[13] It was first featured in the episode \\"Makka Pakka Washes Faces\\".\\r\\nThe Daisy Patch is where Upsy Daisy lives. It is a field full of daisies. Upsy Daisy is usually the only character that can be seen in the patch.[14] It was first featured in the episode \\"The Pontipines in Upsy Daisy's Bed\\".\\r\\nMakka Pakka's Cave is where he lives and his Og-pog is kept outside it, behind a boulder. The cave, along with the Stepping Stone Path was first featured in the episode \\"Makka Pakka Washes Faces\\".\\r\\nThe Tombliboo Bush is where the Tombliboos live. It is the largest house in the garden with so many fun things to do such as playing music, playing with blocks and brushing teeth (like the Pinky Ponk and the Ninky Nonk it is bigger on the inside). It was first featured on the outside in \\"The Tombliboos' Waving Game\\" and on the inside in the episode \\"Too Loud Tombliboos!! Nice and Quiet!!\\"\\r\\nThe Pontipines/Wottingers' House is a small house at the foot of a tree where the Pontipines and Wottingers live. It, along with the Stepping Stone Path and Makka Pakka's Cave was first featured in the episode \\"Makka Pakka Washes Faces\\".\\r\\nThe Tune Bridge is a musical bridge near Makka Pakka's cave. Whenever someone walks on the bridge, it plays a musical tune. It, and the Stepping Stone Path, Makka Pakka's Cave and the Pontipines/Wottingers' House, were first featured in the episode \\"Makka Pakka Washes Faces\\".\\r\\nThe Gazebo is where the characters meet to dance at the end of some episodes.[15] It has a picture of all the characters including the Ball (but except the Tittifers, one of the Trubliphones, the Tiddle and the Bed), the Tittifers' Tree, a Daisy, the Tune Bridge, the Tombliboo Bush, the Tombliboo Instruments, Igglepiggle's Blanket, the Tombliboo Bricks and, of course, the Gazebo, itself. It has two pictures of Makka Pakka, one with his Og-Pog, the other with him blowing his trumpet. The first dance was featured in the episode \\"The Tombliboos' Waving Game\\" and it first gave a clue in \\"Igglepiggle's Blanket in Makka Pakka's Ditch\\".\\r\\nThe Tittifers' Tree is where the Tittifers sing in a certain section and together and at the end.\\r\\nUntil 1 April 2008, the show aired on the CBeebies channel every day, including weekends, at 6:25?PM in the \\"Bedtime Hour\\" slot, in addition to earlier daytime showings on weekdays (like every other show on CBeebies, the same episodes are shown all day).[16] From April until August 2008, In The Night Garden... was removed from its 6:25?PM \\"Bedtime Hour\\" slot, which resulted in a petition asking for the programme to be re-instated to its normal slot.[17] One parent petitioner was quoted by The Daily Telegraph commenting that \\"My four-year-old refused to believe it was bedtime because ITNG hadn't been on and it was daylight outside.\\"[17]\\r\\nThe show returned to the daily \\"Bedtime Hour\\" slot at 6:25?PM as of 30 August 2008, and began showing the second series (beginning with \\"Slow Down Everybody\\") on 1 September 2008.[citation needed] From December 2008, the show was moved again, this time to 6:00?PM.

The range includes small Igglepiggle, Upsy Daisy and Makka Pakka stuffed toys and a small Ninky Nonk train with detachable carriages. Wheeled toy licensee MV Sports & Leisure Limited produced a range of scooters and trikes. Play-doh made some dough that came packaged with an Igglepiggle-shaped cut-out.\\r\\nIn spring 2008, several new toys arrived, including roll-along characters, Talking Cuddly Makka Pakka, Ninky Nonk Pop-up tent and more. Hasbro won the 2008 \\"Best Licensed Toy or Game range\\" Licensing Award for their In The Night Garden... range.[19]\\r\\nIn January 2009, a spokesman for the BBC confirmed that they had asked Hasbro to change the skin colour of the Upsy Daisy doll following \\"a handful of complaints\\". The doll was originally released with a noticeably lighter complexion than seen in the television series, as it was based on the animated version of Upsy Daisy.[20]\\r\\nIn the Night Garden...Live! started a UK tour in July 2010. The show took place in an inflatable purpose-built show dome. The show premired in Liverpool, and moved on to London, Glasgow and Birmingham. In the Night Garden Live has toured the UK every summer.[21][22]","input":"What are the in the night garden characters?"},{"output":"April 11, 1899","context":"","input":"When did puerto rico become part of the us?"},{"output":"Station Casinos","context":"Palms Casino Resort is a hotel and casino located near the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. It has 703 rooms and suites and contains 94,840?sq?ft (8,811?m2) casino, recording studio, Michelin-starred restaurant and 2,500-seat concert theater.[1]\\r\\nAlthough it is located off the Strip, the resort has become a popular destination for many, especially younger people,[who?] Hollywood actors and celebrities. The Palms competes for market share with Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, another off-strip resort aimed toward the 21ÿ39 demographic. Both resorts are styled in a modern, neo-retro fashion.\\r\\nThe Fantasy Tower is also home to several nightlife venues including Moon Nightclub and Rain Nightclub. The tower holds what are known as the Sky Villas and Fantasy Suites, which are some of the most expensive hotel suites in the world. The Two Story Sky Villa on the top floor, billed at US$40,000 per night, is listed at number 5 on the World's 15 Most Expensive Hotel Suites compiled by CNN Go in March 2012.[2] The Sky Villas have played host to numerous celebrities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Palms project was first developed by the Maloof family in July 1999,[3] during the Fiesta hotel-casino expansion. The casino resort broke ground in July 2000. The project was officially announced by George Maloof on October 24, 2000. Construction was completed on September 26, 2001.[4]\\r\\nThe Palms opened on November 15, 2001, to a massive crowd of people. Multiple celebrities attended the grand opening, such as Dennis Rodman, Pamela Anderson, Paris Hilton and Samuel L.

The level they rebuilt to accommodate MTV is now the \\"Real World Suite\\" billed at $10,000 per night.[5][6][6][7]\\r\\nOn October 27, 2005, the second tower, named the \\"Fantasy Tower\\", opened at a cost of $600 million. In keeping with George Maloof's basketball interest (the Maloofs were majority owners of the NBA's Sacramento Kings), the Fantasy Tower includes a two-story, 10,000?sq?ft (930?m2) suite that includes the only basketball court in a hotel suite. The suite includes a locker room, scoreboard, and multi-screen entertainment system. Some of the other fantasy rooms include the G suite, the Barbie suite and the King Pin suite.\\r\\nThe Palms hit financial trouble in 2010, when it started missing loan payments.[8] Under an agreement reached with creditors TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners, they each received a 49% stake in the property in November 2011, in exchange for erasing about $400 million in debt.[8][9] The Maloof family retains a 2% share, with options to buy back up to 20%, and George Maloof continues to manage the property.[9]\\r\\nIn May 2016, Station Casinos agreed to purchase the Palms for $313 million.[10][11]\\r\\nThe Pearl Concert Theater is a three-level concert venue located within the Palms Resort.

Among the most abundant sharks inhabiting the tropical coral reefs of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, this species prefers shallow, inshore waters. Its exposed first dorsal fin is a common sight in the region. Most blacktip reef sharks are found over reef ledges and sandy flats, though they have also been known to enter brackish and freshwater environments. This species typically attains a length of 1.6?m (5.2?ft).\\r\\nBlacktip reef sharks have extremely small home ranges and exhibit strong site fidelity, remaining within the same local area for up to several years at a time. They are active predators of small bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, and have also been known to feed on sea snakes and seabirds. Accounts of the blacktip reef shark's life history have been variable and sometimes contradictory, in part reflecting geographical differences within the species. Like other members of its family, this shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to two to five young on a biennial, annual, or possibly biannual cycle. Reports of the gestation period range from 7ÿ9, through 10ÿ11, to possibly 16 months. Mating is preceded by the male following closely behind the female, likely attracted by her chemical signals. Newborn sharks are found further inshore and in shallower water than adults, frequently roaming in large groups over areas flooded by high tide.\\r\\nTimid and skittish, the blacktip reef shark is difficult to approach and seldom poses a danger to humans unless roused by food. However, people wading through shallow water are at risk of having their legs mistakenly bitten. This shark is used for its meat, fins, and liver oil, but is not considered to be a commercially significant species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the blacktip reef shark as Near Threatened. Although the species as a whole remains widespread and relatively common, overfishing of this slow-reproducing shark has led to its decline at a number of locales.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench naturalists Jean Ren Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard originally described the blacktip reef shark during the 1817ÿ1820 exploratory voyage of the corvette Uranie. In 1824, their account was published as part of Voyage autour du monde...sur les corvettes de S.M. l'Uranie et la Physicienne, Louis de Freycinet's 13-volume report on the voyage. The type specimen was a 59?cm (23?in)-long juvenile male caught off the island of Waigeo, west of New Guinea.[2] Quoy and Gaimard chose the name Carcharias melanopterus, from the Greek melas meaning \\"black\\" and pteron meaning \\"fin\\" or \\"wing\\", in reference to this shark's prominent fin markings.[3]\\r\\nSubsequent authors moved the blacktip reef shark to the genus Carcharhinus; in 1965 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature designated it as the type species for the genus.[2] In some earlier literature, the scientific name of this shark was mistakenly given as C. spallanzani, now recognized as a synonym of the spottail shark (C. sorrah).[4] Other common names for this species include blackfin reef shark, black-finned shark, blacktip shark, reef blacktip shark, and guliman.[5]\\r\\nLike most other members of its genus, the phylogenetic position of the blacktip reef shark remains indeterminate. Based on morphology, Jack Garrick proposed in 1982 that the closest relative of the blacktip reef shark was the nervous shark (C.?cautus).[6] Leonard Compagno's 1988 morphological analysis suggested affinity not only between this species and the nervous shark, but also four other species, and could not resolve their relationships further. A 1998 allozyme analysis by Gavin Naylor again yielded ambiguous results, finding that the blacktip reef shark forms a polytomy (irresolvable group) with 10 other Carcharhinus species.[7]\\r\\nThe blacktip reef shark is found throughout nearshore waters of the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific.[4] In the Indian Ocean, it occurs from South Africa to the Red Sea, including Madagascar, Mauritius, and the Seychelles, and from there eastward along the coast of the Indian Subcontinent to Southeast Asia, including Sri Lanka, the Andaman Islands, and the Maldives. In the Pacific Ocean, it is found from southern China and the Philippines to Indonesia, northern Australia and New Caledonia, and also inhabits numerous oceanic islands, including the Marshall, Gilbert, Society, and Hawaiian Islands and Tuamotu.[8] Contrary to what most sources state, there are no confirmed records of this species from Japanese waters, and purported Japanese specimens likely came from Taiwan.[9] A Lessepsian migrant, this shark has colonized the eastern Mediterranean Sea by way of the Suez Canal.[8]\\r\\nAlthough it has been reported from a depth of 75?m (246?ft),[5] the blacktip reef shark is usually found in water only a few meters deep, and can often be seen swimming close to shore with its dorsal fin exposed.[2] Younger sharks prefer shallow, sandy flats, while older sharks are most common around reef ledges and can also be found near reef drop-offs. This species has also been reported from brackish estuaries and lakes in Madagascar, and freshwater environments in Malaysia, though it is not able to tolerate low salinity to the same degree as the bull shark (C.?leucas).[2] At Aldabra in the Indian Ocean, blacktip reef sharks congregate in the channels between reef flats during low tide and travel to the mangroves when the water rises.[10] There is equivocal evidence that sharks from the northern and southern extremes of its distribution are migratory.[2]\\r\\nA robustly built species with a streamlined \\"typical shark\\" form, the blacktip reef shark has a short, wide, rounded snout and moderately large, oval eyes. Each nostril has a flap of skin in front that is expanded into a nipple-shaped lobe. Not counting small symphysial (central) teeth, the tooth rows number 11ÿ13 (usually 12) on either side of the upper jaw and 10ÿ12 (usually 11) on either side of the lower jaw. The upper teeth are upright to angled and narrowly triangular in shape, bearing serrations that are more coarse on the bases; the lower teeth are similar, but more finely serrated.[2][4] The teeth of adult males are more abruptly curved than those of females.[11]\\r\\nThe pectoral fins are large and narrowly falcate (sickle-shaped), tapering to points. The sizable first dorsal fin is high with a curving \\"S\\"-shaped rear margin, and originates over the free rear tips of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is relatively large with a short rear margin, and is placed opposite the anal fin. There is no ridge between the dorsal fins. This shark is a pale grayish-brown above and white below, with an obvious white band on the sides extending forward from above the anal fin. All the fins have black tips highlighted by lighter-colored borders, which are especially striking on the first dorsal fin and lower caudal fin lobe. Most blacktip reef sharks are no more than 1.6?m (5.2?ft) long, though rarely individuals may reach 1.8?m (5.9?ft) or possibly 2.0?m (6.6?ft).[2] The maximum weight on record is 13.6?kg (30?lb).[5]\\r\\nThe black tip with a light border on the first dorsal fin is a key identifying trait of this shark\\r\\nJaws\\r\\nUpper teeth\\r\\nLower teeth\\r\\nAlong with the grey reef shark (C.?amblyrhinchos) and the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus), the blacktip reef shark is one of the three most common sharks inhabiting coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific. This species predominates in shallow habitats, while the other two are mostly found deeper. Fast-swimming and active, the blacktip reef shark may be encountered alone or in small groups; large \\"social\\" aggregations have also been observed.[2][12] For the most part, juvenile and adult sharks are not segregated by sex, save for the movements of pregnant females to give birth. Individuals exhibit strong fidelity to particular areas, where they may remain for several years.[13]\\r\\nA tracking study off Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific has found the blacktip reef shark has a home range of around 0.55?km2 (0.21?sq?mi), among the smallest of any shark species. The size and location of the range does not change with time of day. Within this range, 3ÿ17% of the area constitute favored hunting patches that are disproportionately occupied by the resident shark. The sharks spend most of their time swimming back and forth along reef ledges, making occasional short forays onto sandy flats. Their average swimming speed decreases when the tide rises at night, possibly because the influx of cooler water reduces their metabolism, or the accompanying movement of prey fishes makes foraging easier.[14] Blacktip reef sharks at Aldabra tend to be more mobile than those at Palmyra, with recorded individual movements of up to 2.5?km (1.6?mi) over 7?hours.[10]\\r\\nBlacktip reef sharks, particularly small individuals, fall prey to larger fishes, including groupers, grey reef sharks, tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), and members of their own species. At Palmyra Atoll, adults avoid patrolling tiger sharks by staying out of the central, deeper lagoon.[14] Their known parasites include the tapeworms Anthobothrium lesteri,[15] Nybelinia queenslandensis,[16] Otobothrium alexanderi,[17] and Platybothrium jondoeorum,[18] a myxosporidian in the genus Unicapsula,[19] and the monogenean Dermophthirius melanopteri.[20] One of the few documented examples of infectious disease in a shark was a fatal case of hemorrhagic septicemia in a blacktip reef shark, caused by the bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.[21]\\r\\nAs often the most abundant apex predator within its ecosystem, the blacktip reef shark plays a major role in structuring inshore ecological communities.[13] Its diet is composed primarily of small teleost fishes, including mullet, groupers, grunters, jacks, mojarras, wrasses, surgeonfish, and smelt-whitings. Groups of blacktip reef sharks in the Indian Ocean have been observed herding schools of mullet against the shore for easier feeding.[22] Squid, octopus, cuttlefish, shrimp, and mantis shrimp are also taken, as well as carrion and smaller sharks and rays, though this is rare.[2][8] Off northern Australia, this species is known to consume sea snakes, including Acrochordus granulatus, Hydrelaps darwiniensis, Hydrophis spp. and Lapemis hardwickii.[23] Sharks off Palmyra Atoll have been documented preying on seabird chicks that have fallen out of their nests into the water.[13] Miscellaneous items that have been found inside the stomachs of this species include algae, turtle grass, coral, hydrozoa, bryozoa, rats, and stones.[10][13]\\r\\nResearchers working at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands have found the blacktip reef shark can be readily attracted by splashing or striking metal tools against hard objects underwater, as well as by the scent of both healthy and injured fish.[24] As with most sharks, the blacktip reef shark does not have any cone cells in its retina, limiting its ability to discriminate colors and fine details. Instead, its vision is adapted for sensitivity to movement or contrast under low light conditions, which is further enhanced by the presence of a reflective tapetum lucidum. Experiments have shown that this shark is capable of detecting small objects up to 1.5ÿ3?m (5ÿ10?ft) away, but is unable to clearly discern the shape of the object.[10][25] Electroreception is another means by which this shark can locate prey; its ampullae of Lorenzini have a sensitivity of approximately 4?nV/cm and an effective range of 25?cm (10?in).[26] Similar to the grey reef shark, this species becomes more excited and \\"confident\\" in the presence of other individuals of its species, and in extreme situations can be roused into a feeding frenzy.[24] Feeding activity may be greater at night than during the day.[10]\\r\\nLike the other members of its family, the blacktip reef shark is viviparous, though the details of its life history vary across its range. Its reproductive cycle is annual off northern Australia, with mating taking place from January to February,[27] as well as off Moorea in French Polynesia, where mating occurs from November to March.[28] The cycle is biennial off Aldabra, where intense competition within and between species for food may constrain females to only bearing young every other year.[10] Earlier accounts from the Indian Ocean by Johnson (1978), Madagascar by Fourmanoir (1961), and the Red Sea by Gohar and Mazhar (1964), indicated a biannual cycle in these regions with two breeding seasons per year from June to July and December to January.[28][29][30] If accurate, the shorter reproductive cycles of these subpopulations may be a consequence of warmer water.[28]\\r\\nWhen receptive to mating, a female blacktip reef shark swims slowly in a sinusoidal pattern near the bottom with her head pointed down; observations in the wild suggest female sharks release chemical signals that allow males to track them. Once the male finds her, he closes to around 15?cm (5.9?in) and follows her with his snout oriented towards her vent.[31] A courting male may also bite the female behind her gills or on her pectoral fins; these mating wounds heal completely after 4ÿ6 weeks.[28] After a period of synchronous swimming, the male pushes the female on her side and positions her so her head is against the bottom and her tail is raised. Once the female is in position, the male inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts for several minutes, after which the sharks separate and resume their regular behavior.[31] Off Moorea, individual older females mate and give birth at a consistent time every year, often to within a week's precision, whereas younger females exhibit more variability in their timing. Younger females are also more likely to fail to become pregnant after mating.[28]\\r\\nThe gestation period has been reported as 10ÿ11 months long in the Indian Ocean and Pacific islands,[10][28] and 7ÿ9 months long off northern Australia.[27] Earlier authors, such as Melouk (1957), have estimated a gestation period as long as 16 months, though the validity of this figure has subsequently been challenged.[28] The female has a single functional ovary (on the right) and two functional uteruses, divided into separate compartments for each embryo. Newly ovulated egg cases measure 3.9?cm (1.5?in) by 2.6?cm (1.0?in); after hatching the embryos are sustained by a yolk sac during the first stage of development. After two months, the embryo measures 4?cm (1.6?in) long and has well-developed external gills. After four months, the yolk sac has begun to be converted into a placental connection that attaches to the uterine wall; at this time, the embryo's dark fin markings develop. By five months, the embryo measures 24?cm (9.4?in) and has resorbed its external gills; the placenta is fully formed, though some yolk remains until seven months into gestation.[10]\\r\\nParturition occurs from September to November, with females making use of shallow nursery areas interior of the reef.[14][27][28] Newborn pups measure 40ÿ50?cm (16ÿ20?in) long in the Indian Ocean and off northern Australia, while free-swimming pups as small as 33?cm (13?in) long have been observed in the Pacific islands.[13][32] The litter size is 2ÿ5 (typically 4), and is not correlated with female size.[8][10] Young blacktip reef sharks commonly form large groups in water barely deep enough to cover their bodies, over sand flats or in mangrove swamps close to shore. During high tide, they also move onto flooded coral platforms or seaweed beds.[14][24][33] Growth is initially rapid; one documented captive shark grew an average of 23?cm (9.1?in) per year in its first two years of life.[34] The growth rate slows to around 5?cm (2.0?in) per year in juveniles and adults.[14] Males and females mature sexually at lengths of 95?cm (37?in) and 97?cm (38?in) respectively off northern Australia,[27] and 105?cm (41?in) and 110?cm (43?in), respectively, off Aldabra.[10] Males mature at 97?cm (38?in) long off Palmyra Atoll.[14]\\r\\nUnder most circumstances, the blacktip reef shark has a timid demeanor and is easily frightened away by swimmers. However, its inshore habitat preferences bring it into frequent contact with humans, and thus it is regarded as potentially dangerous.[2] As of early 2009, 11 unprovoked attacks and 21 attacks total (none fatal) were listed on the International Shark Attack File that are attributable to the blacktip reef shark.[35] Most attacks involve sharks biting the legs or feet of waders, apparently mistaking them for their natural prey, and do not result in serious injury.[2] In the Marshall Islands, native islanders avoid blacktip reef shark attacks by swimming rather than wading through shallow water, and a way of discouraging these sharks is to submerge one's body. The blacktip reef shark has also been known to become aggressive in the presence of bait, and may pose a threat while attempting to steal the catches of spear fishers.[2]\\r\\nThe blacktip reef shark is a regular catch of coastal fisheries, such as those operating off Thailand and India, but is not targeted or considered commercially important.[8] The meat (sold fresh, frozen, dried and salted, or smoked for human consumption), liver oil, and fins are used.[5] The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the blacktip reef shark as Near Threatened. Though it remains widespread and common overall, substantial local declines due to overfishing have now been documented in many areas. This species has a low reproductive rate, limiting its capacity for recovering from depletion.[8][13] Blacktip reef sharks are popular subjects of public aquarium exhibits, because of their stereotypically \\"shark-like\\" appearance, ability to breed in captivity and modest size, and are also attractions for ecotourism divers.[9][11]","input":"Where does a black tip reef shark live?"},{"output":"Country House","context":"Blur are an English rock band formed in London in 1988. The group consists of singer/keyboardist Damon Albarn, guitarist/singer Graham Coxon, bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree. Their debut album Leisure (1991) incorporated the sounds of Madchester and shoegazing. Following a stylistic change influenced by English guitar pop groups such as the Kinks, the Beatles and XTC,[citation needed] Blur released Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). In the process, the band became central to the Britpop music and culture movement, and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a chart battle with rivals Oasis in 1995 dubbed the \\"Battle of Britpop\\".\\r\\nIn recording their 1997 self-titled album Blur, the band underwent another reinvention, showing influence from the lo-fi style of American indie rock groups. The album, including the \\"Song 2\\" single, brought them mainstream success in the US. Their next album, 13 (1999) saw the band members experimenting with electronic and gospel music, and featured more personal lyrics from Albarn. In May 2002, Coxon left Blur during the recording of their seventh album Think Tank (2003). Containing electronic sounds and more minimal guitar work, the album was marked by Albarn's growing interest in hip hop and African music. After a 2003 tour without Coxon, Blur did no studio work or touring as a band, as members engaged in other projects.\\r\\nBlur reunited, with Coxon back in the fold, for a series of concerts in 2009. In the following years they released several singles and retrospective compilations, and toured internationally. In 2012, the group received a Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. Their first major release in twelve years, The Magic Whip (2015), became the sixth consecutive Blur studio album to top the British charts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChildhood friends Damon Albarn and Graham Coxon from Essex met Alex James when they began studying at London's Goldsmiths College in 1988. Albarn was in a group named Circus, who were joined by drummer Dave Rowntree that October.[1][2] Circus requested the services of Coxon after the departure of their guitarist. That December, Circus fired two members and James joined as the group's bassist. This new group named themselves Seymour in December 1988, inspired by J. D. Salinger's Seymour: An Introduction.[2][3] The group performed live for the first time in summer 1989.[4] In November, Food Records' A&R representative Andy Ross attended a Seymour performance that convinced him to court the group for his label. The only concern held by Ross and Food was that they disliked the band's name. Food drew up a list of alternatives, from which the group decided on \\"Blur\\". Food Records finally signed the newly christened band in March 1990.[5]\\r\\nFrom March to July 1990, Blur toured Britain, opening for the Cramps, and testing out new songs. In October 1990, after their tour was over, Blur released the \\"She's So High\\" single, which reached number 48 in the UK Singles Chart.[6] The band had trouble creating a follow-up single, but they made progress when paired with producer Stephen Street. The resulting single release, \\"There's No Other Way\\", became a hit, peaking at number eight.[7] As a result of the single's success, Blur became pop stars and were accepted into a clique of bands who frequented the Syndrome club in London dubbed \\"The Scene That Celebrates Itself\\".[8] NME magazine wrote in 1991, \\"[Blur] are [the] acceptable pretty face of a whole clump of bands that have emerged since the whole Manchester thing started to run out of steam.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe band's third single, \\"Bang\\", performed relatively disappointingly, reaching only number 24.[10] Andy Ross and Food owner David Balfe were convinced Blur's best course of action was to continue drawing influence from the Madchester genre. Blur attempted to expand their musical sound, but the recording of the group's debut album was hindered by Albarn having to write his lyrics in the studio. Although the resulting album Leisure (1991) peaked at number seven on the UK Albums Chart, it received mixed reviews,[6] and according to journalist John Harris, \\"could not shake off the odour of anti-climax\\".[11]\\r\\nAfter discovering they were S60,000 in debt, Blur toured the United States in 1992 in an attempt to recoup their financial losses.[12] The group released the single \\"Popscene\\" to coincide with the start of the tour. Featuring \\"a rush of punk guitars, '60s pop hooks, blaring British horns, controlled fury, and postmodern humor\\",[13] \\"Popscene\\" was a turning point for the band musically.[14] However, upon its release it only charted at number 32. \\"We felt 'Popscene' was a big departure; a very, very English record\\", Albarn told the NME in 1993, \\"But that annoyed a lot of people ... We put ourselves out on a limb to pursue this English ideal and no-one was interested.\\"[15] As a result of the single's lacklustre performance, plans to release a single named \\"Never Clever\\" were scrapped and work on Blur's second album was pushed back.[16]\\r\\nDuring the two-month American tour, the band became increasingly unhappy, often venting frustrations on each other, leading to several physical confrontations.[17] The band members were homesick; Albarn said, \\"I just started to miss really simple things ... I missed everything about England so I started writing songs which created an English atmosphere.\\"[15] Upon the group's return to Britain, Blur (Albarn in particular) were upset by the success rival group Suede had achieved while they were gone.[18] After a poor performance at a 1992 gig that featured a well-received set by Suede on the same bill, Blur were in danger of being dropped by Food.[19] By that time, Blur had undergone an ideological and image shift intended to celebrate their English heritage in contrast to the popularity of American grunge bands like Nirvana.[20] Although sceptical of Albarn's new manifesto for Blur, Balfe gave assent for the band's choice of Andy Partridge (of XTC) to produce their follow-up to Leisure. The sessions with Partridge proved unsatisfactory, but a chance reunion with Stephen Street resulted in him returning to produce the group.[21]\\r\\nBlur completed their second album Modern Life Is Rubbish in December 1992, but Food Records said the album required more potential hit singles and asked them to return to the studio for a second time. The band complied and Albarn wrote \\"For Tomorrow\\", which became the album's lead single.[22] \\"For Tomorrow\\" was a minor success, reaching number 28 on the charts.[23] Modern Life Is Rubbish was released in May 1993. The announcement of the album's release included a press photo which featured Blur, dressed in a mix of mod and skinhead attire, posing alongside a mastiff with the words \\"British Image 1\\" spraypainted behind them. At the time, such imagery was viewed as nationalistic and racially insensitive by the British music press; to quieten concerns, Blur released the \\"British Image 2\\" photo, which was \\"a camp restaging of a pre-war aristocratic tea party\\".[24] Modern Life Is Rubbish peaked at number 15 on the British charts,[25] but failed to break into the US Billboard 200, selling only 19,000 copies there.[26][27]\\r\\nThe success of Parklife (1994) revived Blur's commercial fortunes. The album's first single, the disco-influenced \\"Girls & Boys\\", found favour on BBC Radio 1 and peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart,[28] and number 59 in the US Billboard Hot 100 where it remains the band's highest-charting single.[27] Parklife entered the British charts at number one and stayed on the album charts for 90 weeks.[29] Enthusiastically greeted by the music pressthe NME called it \\"a Great Pop Record ... bigger, bolder, narkier and funnier [than Modern Life is Rubbish]\\"Parklife is regarded as one of Britpop's defining records.[30][31] Blur won four awards at the 1995 Brit Awards, including Best Band and Best Album for Parklife.[32] Coxon later pointed to Parklife as the moment when \\"[Blur] went from being regarded as an alternative, left field arty band to this amazing new pop sensation\\".[33]\\r\\nBlur began working on their fourth album The Great Escape at the start of 1995.[34] Building upon the band's previous two albums, Albarn's lyrics for the album consisted of several third-person narratives. James reflected, \\"It was all more elaborate, more orchestral, more theatrical, and the lyrics were even more twisted ... It was all dysfunctional, misfit characters fucking up.\\"[35] The release of the album's lead single \\"Country House\\" played a part in Blur's public rivalry with Manchester band Oasis termed the \\"Battle of Britpop\\". Partly due to increasing antagonisms between the groups, Blur and Oasis ultimately decided to release their new singles on the same day, an event the NME called \\"The British Heavyweight Championship\\". The debate over which band would top the British singles chart became a media phenomenon, and Albarn appeared on the News at Ten.[36] At the end of the week, \\"Country House\\" ultimately outsold Oasis' \\"Roll With It\\" by 274,000 copies to 216,000, becoming Blur's first number one single.[37]\\r\\nThe Great Escape, which Albarn told the public was the last instalment in the band's Life Trilogy, was released in September 1995 to ecstatic reviews.[38] The NME hailed it as \\"spectacularly accomplished, sumptuous, heart-stopping and inspirational\\",[39] while Mojo argued \\"Blur are the very best that '95 Britpop has to offer and this is a most gong-worthy sound, complete with head-slicing guitars, catchy tunes and very funny words\\".[40] Entering the UK charts at number one,[41] the album sold nearly half a million copies in its first month of sale.[42] However, opinion quickly changed and Blur found themselves largely out of favour with the media once again. Following the worldwide success of Oasis' (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (which went quadruple platinum in America), the media quipped \\"[Blur] wound up winning the battle but losing the war.\\"[43] Blur became perceived as an \\"inauthentic middle class pop band\\" in comparison to the \\"working class heroes\\" Oasis, which Albarn said made him feel \\"stupid and confused\\".[36] Alex James later summarised, \\"After being the People's Hero, Damon was the People's Prick for a short period ... basically, he was a loser ÿ very publicly.\\"[44]\\r\\nAn early 1996 Q magazine interview revealed that relations between Blur members had become very strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy wrote that he found them \\"on the verge of a nervous breakup\\".[44] Coxon, in particular, began to resent his bandmates: James for his playboy lifestyle, and Albarn for his control over Blur's musical direction and public image.[44] The guitarist struggled with drinking problems and, in a rejection of the group's Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement.[45] In February 1996, when Coxon and James were absent for a lip-synced Blur performance broadcast on Italian television, they were replaced by a cardboard cutout and a roadie, respectively. Blur biographer Stuart Maconie later wrote that, at the time, \\"Blur were sewn together very awkwardly\\".[44]\\r\\nAlthough he had previously dismissed it, Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon's tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to significantly change Blur's musical direction once again. \\"I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you've got to move on\\", he said.[44] He subsequently approached Street, and argued for a more stripped-down sound on the band's next record. Coxon, recognising his own personal need toas Rowntree put it\\"work this band\\", wrote a letter to Albarn, describing his desire for their music \\"to scare people again\\". After initial sessions in London, the band left to record the rest of the album in Iceland, away from the Britpop scene.[44]\\r\\nThe result was Blur, the band's fifth studio album, released in February 1997. Although the music press predicted that the lo-fi sonic experimentation would alienate Blur's teenage girl fan-base, they generally applauded the effort. Pointing out lyrics such as \\"Look inside America/She's alright\\", and noting Albarn's \\"obligatory nod to Beck, [and promotion of] the new Pavement album as if paid to do so\\", reviewers felt the band had come to accept American values during this timean about-face of their attitude during the Britpop years.[46] Despite cries of \\"commercial suicide\\", the album and its first single, \\"Beetlebum\\", debuted at number one in the UK.[47] Although the album could not match the sales of their previous albums in the UK, Blur became the band's most successful internationally.[47] In the US, the album received strong reviews; Blur reached number 61 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold.[27][48] The album's \\"Song 2\\" single was also popular on alternative radio, reaching number six on the Modern Rock chart.[27] After it was licensed for use in various mediasuch as soundtracks, advertisements and television shows\\"Song 2\\" became the most recognisable Blur song in the US. After the success of Blur, the band embarked on a nine-month world tour.[44]\\r\\nIn February 1998, a few months after completing the tour, Blur released Bustin' + Dronin' for the Japanese market. The album is a collection of Blur songs remixed by artists such as Thurston Moore, William Orbit and Moby. Among the tracks, the band were most impressed by Orbit's effort and enlisted him to replace Street as producer for their next album,[49] citing a need to approach the recording process from a fresh perspective.[33]\\r\\nReleased in March 1999, Blur's sixth studio album 13 saw them drift still further away from their Britpop-era attitude and sound. Orbit's production style allowed for more jamming, and incorporated a \\"variety of emotions, atmospheres, words and sounds\\" into the mix. 13 was creatively dominated by Coxon, who \\"was simply allowed to do whatever he chose, unedited\\", by Orbit.[50] Albarn's lyricsmore heart-felt, personal and intimate than on previous occasionswere reflective of his break-up with Elastica frontwoman Justine Frischmann, his partner of eight years.[50] The album received generally favourable reviews from the press. While Q called it \\"a dense, fascinating, idiosyncratic and accomplished art rock album\\",[51] the NME felt it was inconsistent and \\"(at least) a quarter-of-an-hour too long\\".[52] 13 debuted at the top of the UK charts, staying at that position for two weeks. The album's lead single, the gospel-based \\"Tender\\", opened at the second spot on the charts. After \\"Coffee & TV\\", the first Blur single to feature Coxon on lead vocals, only reached number 11 in the UK, manager Chris Morrison demanded a chart re-run because of what he deemed was a sales miscalculation.[53]\\r\\nIn July 1999, in celebration of their tenth anniversary, Blur released a 22-CD limited edition box-set of their singles. The accompanying tour saw Blur play the A-sides of the 22 singles in their chronological order of release.[54] In October 2000, the group released the compilation Blur: The Best of, which debuted at number three in the UK and received a Platinum certification for 300,000 copies shipped.[55] Dismissed by the band as \\"the first record we have seen as product\\", the track listing and release dates of Blur: The Best of were determined on the basis of market research and focus groups conducted by Blur's record label, EMI.[56] By this time, the group had largely disowned the upbeat pop singles from the Britpop era, and favoured the more arty, experimental work on Blur and 13. In an otherwise highly enthusiastic review of the best-of for the NME, Steve Sutherland criticised the band's \\"sheer disregard\\" for their earlier work; \\"Just because these songs embarrassed them once they started listening to broadsheet critics and retreated wounded from the big-sales battle with Oasis doesn't mean that we're morons to love them.\\"[57]\\r\\nAfter 13 and the subsequent tours in 1999ÿ2000, band members pursued other projects. Graham Coxon recorded a string of solo albums, while Damon Albarn dedicated his time to Gorillaz, the animated band he had created with Jamie Hewlett. Alex James worked with Fat Les and co-wrote several songs with Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Marianne Faithfull.[58][59]\\r\\nRecording for Blur's next album began in London in November 2001, but concerted work started in June 2002, with the sessions moving to Marrakech, Morocco soon after, and then to Devon back in the UK. Not long after the sessions began, Coxon left the group.[60] Coxon said \\"there were no rows\\" and \\"[the band] just recognised the feeling that we needed some time apart\\".[61] Before the album was released, Blur released a new single, \\"Don't Bomb When You Are the Bomb\\" as a very limited white label release. The song is largely electronic, and was part of the band's protest against war in the Middle East. Albarn, however, attempted to assuage fans' fears that the album would be electronic by providing reassurances that the band's new album would be \\"a rockin' record\\", and also said that it has \\"a lot of finely crafted pop songs\\".[62] Early in 2002, Blur recorded a song that would be played by European Space Agency's Beagle 2 lander once it touched down;[63] however, attempts to locate the probe after it landed on Mars were fruitless.[64]\\r\\nThink Tank, released in May 2003, was filled with atmospheric, brooding electronic sounds, featuring simpler guitar lines played by Albarn, and largely relying on other instruments to replace Coxon. The guitarist's absence also meant that Think Tank was almost entirely written by Albarn. Its sound was seen as a testament to Albarn's increasing interest in African and Middle Eastern music, and to his complete control over the group's creative direction.[65] Think Tank was yet another UK number one and managed Blur's highest US position of number 56.[25][27] It was also nominated for best album at the 2004 Brit Awards.[66] The band did a successful tour in 2003, with former Verve guitarist Simon Tong filling in for Coxon.[67]\\r\\nIn 2005, XFM News reported that Blur would record an EP, and denied that they would hire a replacement guitarist for Coxon.[68] There were also some aborted recordings made in 2005. Overall the band kept a low profile and did no studio or touring work as a three-piece. After Coxon significantly thawed on the subject of rejoining Blur,[69] in 2007 band members announced that they would reunite, and that they intended to record together first in August, with the date later being pushed back to September, then October.[70][71] Though the band members finally met up in October, they posted on their website that they had only \\"met up for an enjoyable lunch\\" and that there were no \\"other music plans for Blur\\".[72]\\r\\nIn December 2008, Blur announced they would reunite for a concert at London's Hyde Park on 3 July 2009.[72] Days later, the band added a second date, for 2 July.[73] A series of June preview shows were also announced, ending at Manchester Evening News arena on the 26th. All the shows were well received; The Guardian's music critic Alexis Petridis gave their performance at Goldsmiths college a full five stars, and wrote \\"Blur's music seems to have potentiated by the passing of years ... they sound both more frenetic and punky and more nuanced and exploratory than they did at the height of their fame\\".[74] Blur headlined the Glastonbury Festival on 28 June, where they played for the first time since their headline slot in 1998. Reviews of the Glastonbury performance were enthusiastic; The Guardian called them \\"the best Glastonbury headliners in an age\\".[75] The band released their second greatest hits album Midlife: A Beginner's Guide to Blur in June 2009.\\r\\nBlur also headlined at other summer festivals, including Oxegen 2009 in Ireland,[76] and the Scottish outdoor show of T in the Park. Their T in the Park headline slot was put in jeopardy after Graham Coxon was admitted to hospital with food poisoning. Ultimately, the band did play, albeit an hour and a half after they were scheduled to appear.[77] After the completion of the reunion dates, James said the group had not discussed further plans, and Albarn told Q soon after that Blur had no intention of recording or touring again. He said, \\"I just can't do it anymore\\", and explained that the main motivation for participating in the reunion was to repair his relationship with Coxon, which he succeeded at.[78] Coxon also said that no further Blur activity was planned, telling NME.com in September, \\"We're in touch and we say 'Wotcha' and all that but nothing has been mentioned about any more shows or anything else\\".[79]\\r\\nIn January 2010, No Distance Left to Run, a documentary about the band, was released in cinemas and a month later on DVD.[80] In April 2010, Blur released their first new recording since 2003, \\"Fool's Day\\", for the Record Store Day event, as a vinyl record limited to 1000 copies; it was later made available as a free download on their website.[81] No Distance Left to Run was nominated as Best Long Form Music Video for the 53rd Grammy Awards, Blur's first-ever Grammy nomination.[82]\\r\\nIn February 2012, Blur were awarded the Outstanding Contribution to Music award at the 2012 Brit Awards.[83] Later that month, Albarn and Coxon premiered a new track together live, \\"Under the Westway\\".[84] In April, the band announced that a box-set entitled Blur 21containing all seven Blur studio albums, four discs of unreleased rarities and three DVDswould be released in July.[85] Blur had also entered the studio early that year to record material for a new album, but in May producer William Orbit told the NME that Albarn had halted recording.[86] Blur's official Twitter and Facebook pages announced that the band would release two singles \\"The Puritan\\" and \\"Under the Westway\\" on 2 July.[87] That August, Blur headlined a show at Hyde Park for the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.[88] In 2013, the band performed at the Rock Werchter in Belgium, the Spanish and Portuguese dates of the Primavera Sound festival,[89] and the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in the United States.[90]\\r\\nIn April 2015, Blur released their first studio album in twelve years, The Magic Whip. Conceived over five days in Hong Kong after a cancelled Japan tour in 2013, the album was inspired by the city as well. \\"There's nothing pastoral about it\\", Albarn said, \\"it's very urban\\". The Magic Whip also marks the return of Coxon, absent on all but one track on Think Tank, and Stephen Street, Blur's producer during the Britpop era.[91] Upon its release, the record was greeted with applause both by the music press and the mainstream media.[92] Awarding the album a full five stars, The Daily Telegraph called The Magic Whip \\"a triumphant comeback that retains the band's core identity while allowing ideas they'd fermented separately over the past decade to infuse their sound with mature and peculiar new flavour combinations\\".[93] The NME concurred, saying Blur were \\"a reunited band making music to rival their very best\\".[94] It was also a commercial success, becoming the sixth consecutive Blur LP since Parklife (1994) to top the British charts. The Guardian also noted that at times during its first week of release, The Magic Whip sold \\"more than the rest of the top five combined\\".[95] That December New World Towers, a documentary on the recording process of The Magic Whip, was released in select British theatres.[96][97]","input":"What was blur's first number one single in the uk?"},{"output":"Columbus, Ohio","context":"Wendy's is an American international fast food restaurant chain founded by Dave Thomas on November 15, 1969, in Columbus, Ohio. The company moved its headquarters to Dublin, Ohio, on January 29, 2006. As of 2016, Wendy's was the world's third largest hamburger fast food chain with 6,500+ locations, following Burger King and McDonald's. On April 24, 2008, the company announced a merger with Triarc Companies Inc., a publicly traded company and the parent company of Arby's. Despite the new ownership, Wendy's headquarters remained in Dublin. Previously, Wendy's had rejected more than two buyout offers from Triarc. Following the merger, Triarc became known as Wendy's/Arby's Group, and later as The Wendy's Company.\\r\\nAs of January 2, 2017, there were a total of 6,537 locations, including 330 that are company-owned. 6,207 restaurants are franchised, and 77% of them are located in North America. While Wendy's sets standards for exterior store appearance, food quality, and menu, individual owners have control over hours of operations, interior decor, pricing and staff uniforms and wages.\\r\\nWendy's menu consists primarily of hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, French fries and beverages, including the signature Frosty, which is a soft-serve frozen dairy dessert. Since phasing out their famous \\"Big Classic\\", the company does not have a signature sandwich, such as the Burger King Whopper or the McDonald's Big Mac - although, by default, the \\"signature sandwich\\" spot seems to have been filled by Dave's 1/4?lb. Single (introduced in 2011 as Dave's Hot 'N Juicy as a reworking of the longstanding Wendy's Single, shortened to simply Dave's in 2016), a square-pattied burger made with fresh ground beef rather than round frozen patties. Wendy's uses square hamburger patties ÿ which hang over the edge of a circular bun ÿ as its signature item.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chain is known for its square hamburgers, sea salt fries and the Frosty, a form of soft serve ice cream mixed with frozen starches. The idea for Wendy's \\"old fashioned\\" hamburgers was inspired by Dave Thomas's trips to Kewpee Hamburgers in his home town of Kalamazoo, Michigan. The Kewpee sold square hamburgers and thick malt shakes, much like the well-known restaurant that Thomas eventually founded in Columbus, Ohio, in 1969. Square patties had corners that stuck out so that customers could easily see the quality of the meat.[4] The Columbus location later added a Tim Hortons and was closed on March 2, 2007, after 38 years of business due to declining sales.[5][6] Thomas named the restaurant after his fourth child Melinda Lou \\"Wendy\\" Thomas.[7] Photographs of her were on display at the original Wendy's restaurant until it closed. In August 1972, the first Wendy's franchisee, L.S. Hartzog, signed an agreement for Indianapolis, Indiana.[8] Also, in 1972, Wendy's aired its first TV commercials that were only broadcast locally in Ohio. This series of commercials was titled \\"C'mon to Wendy's\\" because they stressed Wendy's superiority through the \\"Quality Is Our Recipe\\" slogan and featured an animated Wendy similar to the one from the corporate logo along with dancing hamburgers.\\r\\nThe first Canadian restaurant also opened in Hamilton, ON in 1976.[9] In December 1976, Wendy's opened its 500th restaurant, located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\\r\\nIn March, 1978 Wendy's opened its 1000th restaurant in Springfield, Tennessee\\r\\nWendy's founded the fried chicken chain Sisters Chicken in 1978 and sold it to its largest franchiser in 1987.[10]\\r\\nIn 1979, the first European Wendy's opened in Munich.[11] The same year Wendy's became the first fast-food chain to introduce the salad bar.[12]\\r\\nWendy's entered the Asian market by opening its first restaurants in Japan in 1980, in Hong Kong in 1982 and in the Philippines and Singapore in 1983.[13][14][15][16] In 1984, Wendy's opened its first restaurant in South Korea.[17]\\r\\nIn response to a 1986 slowdown in the chain's performance, Wendy's restructured its cleanliness standards, menu, and other operational details to ensure that stores met the goals and standards of the parent company so that its franchises were competitive in the market.[18] Wendy's closed all its outlets in Hong Kong in 1986 and in Singapore in the following year.[14][16]\\r\\nFrom 1988 to 1990, Wendy's expanded operations globally to Mexico, New Zealand, Indonesia, Greece, Turkey, Guatemala, as well as the U.S. Naval Base in Naples, Italy.[19][20] In 1988, Wendy's expanded its bar to a full-blown buffet called the Superbar for $2.99. The Superbar had various stations: \\"Mexican Fiesta\\", the Italian \\"Pasta Pasta,\\" and the \\"Garden Spot\\", salad and fruit. The Superbar was popular but difficult to maintain thus was discontinued in 1998.[21]\\r\\nIn 1989, Wendy's opened its first restaurant in Greece at Syntagma Square being the first foreign fast-food chain in the country. After opened 12 restaurants in 3 cities the company finally abandoned the Greek market in 2002.[22]\\r\\nIn 1996, the chain expanded in Argentina by opening 18 local restaurants. However, all of them closed only four years later due to the economic crisis in the country.[23]\\r\\nIn 1998, Wendy's pulled out of South Korea by closing all its 15 restaurants and in 2000 exited from the UK, Argentina, and Hong Kong.[11][17][24]\\r\\nGarden Sensations salads were added in 2002.[12]\\r\\nWendy's signed a franchise agreement to re-enter the Singapore market in 2009[16] though that agreement was short-lived; in April 2015, Wendy's ceased operation in the country and closed all the restaurants.[25]\\r\\nIn 2011, Wendy's returned to Japan and Argentina announcing a development agreement for 50 restaurants in the country.[26][27] It also entered the Russian market for first time with plans to open 180 restaurants over a 10-year period.[28]\\r\\nIn 2013, Wendy's opened the first restaurant in Georgia and made a deal to open 25 restaurants in Georgia and the Republic of Azerbaijan.[29]\\r\\nIn 2014, Wendy's closed all its restaurants in Russia.[28] In September 2014, several pork based products were introduced to be on sale until early November. These included a standard pulled pork sandwich with slaw and three sauce options, a BBQ Pulled Pork Cheeseburger and cheese fries with pulled pork, cheddar cheese sauce, onions, and barbecue sauce.[30]\\r\\nIn May 2015, Wendy's announced they would be expanding into India, with its first outlet located in Gurgaon.[31]\\r\\nWendy's is planning to sell 540 of its restaurants. The divesture is the second step in a three-step action plan to improve the brand. Other steps include new openings and remodeling of existing stores. In 2015, the brand expects to open 80 new restaurants. It will remodel 450 of its existing locations. The brand's goal is to remodel at least 60% of its North American locations by 2020 year-end.[32] In September 2016, it was announced that JAE Restaurant Group had acquired 97 Wendy's restaurants throughout the South Florida region.[33] JAE Restaurant Group is one of the countrys largest franchisee owners. The Group owns 177 Wendys Restaurants. Wendys Co. has been looking to remodel existing stores and upgrade the curb appeal of its locations. They have been doing this by adding fireplaces, more seating options, adding WiFi and flat screen TVs, and digital menus.[33] Wendys Co expects to sell 258 more restaurants during the rest of 2016. In total, they will be looking to sell $435 million of its restaurants.[needs update]\\r\\nWendy's offers two different hamburger patties, a \\"Junior\\" 1.78?ounce (50.4?gram) patty and its \\"Single\\" 4 ounce (113.4?gram) patty. 4-ounce patties are sold in single, double and triple sizes whereas the junior patties sell in single and double patties. The previous size of 2 ounces per junior patty was altered to its current size in 2007 to save on expenses from rising food costs. Originally Wendy's had only two kinds of chicken sandwiches, fried and grilled. The spicy chicken sandwich started out as a promotional sandwich. It was later put on the menu full-time in 1996 due to its popularity and the fact that, compared to most promotional sandwiches, it was much simpler to make (it used the same condiments as the standard breaded chicken sandwich).\\r\\nThe Frescata line of sandwiches also went from being promotional items to main menu items. After going through several revisions, the Turkey and Swiss and the Ham and Swiss were put on the menu full-time. However, the Frescata sandwiches were discontinued in mid-December 2007.\\r\\nOccasionally, some Wendy's restaurants would offer a fried fish sandwich for some of its customers who desire fish instead of beef or chicken.\\r\\nIn 1988, Wendy's was the first fast-food chain to create a single price-point value menu where all items listed on that menu were priced exclusively at 99S. The menu was restructured in 2007 due to rising costs as the Super Value Menu with prices ranging from 99S to $2.00 USD.\\r\\nIn mid-2007, Wendy's began a national debut of its new breakfast menu in its U.S. and Canadian stores. Wendy's experimented with serving breakfast for a short time in 1985, but the endeavor was unsuccessful due to many issues.[34][35] While approximately 12 Wendy's restaurants in the U.S. and its territories have been serving breakfast since then, Wendy's has not had a company-wide breakfast offering.[35][36]\\r\\nThe newer breakfast menu differs slightly from the ones featured in 1985, and it is structured similarly to its lunch/dinner menu, with value meals and various sides like blended fruit.[36] Menu items include several breakfast sandwiches served on biscuits, frescuit and Kaiser rolls, breakfast burritos and side orders of hash browns, muffins, and cinnamon sticks.[37] In order to avoid the same issues the original 1985 breakfast offerings faced, the new menu was designed for ease of operation, lower costs, and reduced preparation time.[35]\\r\\nIn January 2016, Wendy's announced a transition plan to source only cage-free eggs by the year 2020 in all U.S. and Canadian locations that serve breakfast.[38][39]\\r\\nAfter successful early growth of the chain, sales flattened as the company struggled to achieve brand differentiation in the highly competitive fast-food market. This situation would turn around in the mid-1980s. Starting on January 9, 1984, elderly actress Clara Peller was featured in the successful \\"Where's the Beef?\\" North American commercial campaign written by Cliff Freeman. Her famous line quickly entered the American pop culture (it was even used by Walter Mondale in a debate with Gary Hart in the Democratic primary election) and served to promote Wendy's hamburgers. Peller, age 83, was dropped from the campaign in 1985 because she performed in a commercial for Prego spaghetti sauce, saying she \\"finally found\\" the beef.[51]\\r\\nPeller was soon after replaced by Wendy's founder Dave Thomas himself. Soft-spoken and bashful, the \\"Dave\\" ads generally focused on Thomas praising his products and offering a commitment to quality service, although there would occasionally be \\"wackier\\" ads as well. Thomas ultimately appeared in more than 800 commercials, more than any other company founder in television history.[52]\\r\\nAfter Dave Thomas' death in 2002, Wendy's struggled to find a new advertising campaign. After a round of conventional ads describing the food they serve, in 2004 they tried using a character they made called \\"Mr. Wendy\\" who claimed to be the unofficial spokesperson for the chain. These proved to be extremely unsuccessful. After seven months, Wendy's returned to an animated campaign focusing on the difference between Wendy's square hamburgers and the round hamburgers of competitors.\\r\\nWendy's marketing arm engages in product placement in films and television and is sometimes seen on ABC's reality show Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, serving food to the more than 100 construction workers.\\r\\nA 2007 Wendy's commercial featured the tune from the Violent Femmes song \\"Blister in the Sun.\\" The inclusion of the song in the commercial provoked an internal conflict between members of the Violent Femmes, which resulted in a lawsuit between bassist Brian Ritchie and lead singer Gordon Gano that ultimately led to the band disbanding in 2009.[53][54]\\r\\nWith their \\"That's right\\" ad campaign not a success, Wendy's unveiled a new ad campaign, featuring the animated version of their mascot voiced by Luci Christian highlighting certain menu items. The new ad campaign made its debut in late January 2008, with slogans: in the USA: \\"It's waaaay better than fast food. It's Wendy's.\\" and in Canada,\\"It's waaaay delicious. It's Wendy's.\\" [55] The company's slogan, \\"you know when it's real,\\" was introduced in 2010.\\r\\nIn November 2010, a series of commercials aired featuring the company's namesake, Wendy Thomas, which marked the first time she had appeared in a Wendy's advertisement.[56][57]\\r\\nIn April 2012, Morgan Smith Goodwin began appearing as the redhead in ads with the slogan \\"Now that's better.\\"[58][59] In 2013, social media advertising featuring Nick Lachey directed at millennials promoted the Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger.[60]\\r\\nA 2014 campaign to promote the Tuscan Chicken on Ciabatta sandwich entitled \\"L'Estrella de la Toscana,\\" or \\"Star of Tuscany\\" in English was launched on television and social media.[61] A 2014 campaign to promote the Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger was run until November 2014 was shown to many people watching TV starting on March 18, 2014","input":"Where was the original wendy's restaurant located?"},{"output":"Glory to Buddha Amitabha","context":"In Senegal, Mahayana Buddhism is followed by a very tiny portion of the Vietnamese community,[1] but it is informal Buddhism because they only worship their ancestors by burning the incenses on a small altar and in the end of all prayers are: \\"Nam m?

Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi in the title roles of an earnest police officer and a notorious don from North Chennai respectively. The cast also includes Varalaxmi Sarathkumar, Shraddha Srinath and Kathir in significant roles. Based on the Indian meta-folktale Baital Pachisi (Vedhala Kadhai in Tamil), the film tells the story of a tough police officer who sets out to track down and kill an equally tough gangster.\\r\\nIn January 2015, producer S. Sashikanth of Y NOT Studios revealed that directors Pushkar and Gayathri would be making a comeback as directors with a film starring Vijay Sethupathi, having previously made Oram Po (2007) and Va (2010). Following a year of scripting throughout 2015, the team signed Madhavan to play another lead role in February 2016 and pre-production works began thereafter. Production started in November the same year and was completed by February 2017. The film was shot mainly in North Chennai, with the area being used as the film's backdrop. The film had cinematography by P. S. Vinod and editing by Richard Kevin while the soundtrack was scored by Sam C. S.\\r\\nVikram Vedha was released following brief delays on 21 July 2017 and received positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards the film's script and the performances of the lead actors Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi. Made at cost of ?110 million, the film performed well at the box office and became the second highest-grossing Tamil film of the year upon release. The film's success resurrected the Tamil film industry, which was experiencing difficulties after a series of box office failures and the changes resulting from the Goods and Services Tax.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story begins with an animated interpretation of the Baital Pachisi. The influences from this mythological tale correlates with Vikram, a brave and honest police inspector who is decisive about right and wrong, and Vedha, a gangster who seems to understand the grey shades between good and evil. Vikram is part of an encounter unit led by his colleague Simon, which is formed to eliminate Vedha. On one such encounter, the squad kills some of Vedha's henchmen, framing the death of an unarmed criminal killed by Simon to avoid further inquiry. When a new recruit, Santhanam is nervous about this, Vikram calms him by saying that he sleeps peacefully at night despite the encounters because he knows that the men he shoots are criminals, and not innocent. The unit makes plans for another raid when, Vedha walks into the police station and surrenders. When Vikram interrogates Vedha, he offers to tell Vikram a story.\\r\\nThe first story is about how Vedha became a gangster and cocaine smuggler. Vedha actively dissuades his brother Vignesh, called Puli due to him being profilic in arithmetic, to stay away from crime, but Puli is forced by a rival gangster, Ravi, to carry drugs. When Puli is caught by the police, he confesses and Ravi is arrested. Under his boss Sangu's orders Ravi assaults Puli, which leaves a permanent mark in his hand. Vedha then asks Vikram if he should kill Ravi or Sangu. Vikram replies that Ravi was merely an instrument and that Sangu was the real culprit. Vedha appreciates his answer implying that he did kill Sangu. At this point Vedha's lawyer intervenes and he is bailed out. Vikram is stunned to find out that Vedha is represented by his wife, Priya.\\r\\nVikram realises that unarmed person shot by Simon was Puli, based on the mark in his hand. Presuming that Vedha might try to kill Simon, Vikram rushes to save Simon only to find him and Puli's girlfriend, Chandra, shot dead. Surendhar, the Superintendent of Police and leader of the unit dismisses it as a failed encounter. Priya refuses to divulge Vedha's whereabouts to Vikram, which tests their marriage. Shocked and angry, Vikram raids Vedha's tenements, captures him and brings him into the woods, when Vedha pleads with Vikram to listen to another story as his last request.\\r\\nThe second story starts with Puli, now grown up, offering to launder Vedha's income by investing it in shares. Vedha's new boss Cheta invests five million rupees into this venture. One day Chandra is supposedly kidnapped and the money is missing. Chandra later returns and reveals that she had stolen the money to start a new life, away from the tenements and crime, but her love for Puli brought her back to him. Vedha returns the money to Cheta, but is ordered to kill Chandra for betraying Cheta in the first place. Vedha now asks Vikram if he should respect his boss and carry out the order or if he should disobey Cheta, an action that would escalate into a gang war. Vikram replies that he should support Puli as he is innocent and oppose Cheta, to which Vedha agrees. Vikram stumbles for a moment on realising the truth about Puli's innocence. Seizing the opportunity, Vedha attacks Vikram and flees, after telling him to investigate the deaths of Simon and Puli.\\r\\nA troubled Vikram starts investigating Puli's death. He recalls that Vedha managed to get Puli and Chandra out of Chennai after opposing Cheta, and wonders why Puli was present at the site of the encounter. He also notices that Chandra was tortured prior to her death. Vikram finally discovers that Ravi was the mastermind behind Puli's death and informs Vedha, who then tracks Ravi down and brings him to an abandoned factory. Vikram arrives to find Ravi beaten within an inch of his life. Vedha proceeds to tell Vikram the third and final story.\\r\\nVedha had sent Puli and Chandra to Mumbai away from Cheta. He also notices that only his men and not Cheta's are being systematically targeted and eliminated by the police. Based on Ravi's confession, Vedha says that Simon was paid by Ravi to kill his men. Vedha asks Vikram if Simon was right since he became corrupt to get the money to pay for his young and critically ill son's medical procedure. Vedha then kills Ravi and escapes before Vikram can answer.\\r\\nThe encounter unit arrives and castigates Vikram for letting Vedha escape again. Vikram then slowly realises that the entire unit too had been paid by Ravi. Surendhar reveals that Ravi had paid them to kill Vedha and Chandra's abduction was intended to get Puli from Mumbai, which would then lure Vedha out of hiding. The guilt-ridden Simon had gone to save Chandra but were both killed by the unit. As the unit prepares to kill Vikram, Vedha reappears and saves him. A gunfight ensues, where Vikram shoots and disables his colleagues who were mere pawns but kills Surendhar. Vedha and Vikram then engage in a standoff. Vikram asks Vedha if he should let him go for saving his life or kill him since he is a criminal. The film ends with the standoff between them.\\r\\nThe project was first revealed to the media by S. Sashikanth, the owner of production house Y NOT Studios, in an interview to The Hindu during January 2015, when he confirmed that he would produce the film to be directed by husband and wife duo Pushkar and Gayathri. Telling the tale of an encounter cop and his pursuit of a gangster, he revealed that Vijay Sethupathi had agreed to feature as the gangster in the project.[6][7] The directors revealed that the story for the film was inspired by the Indian meta-folktale Baital Pachisi (Vedhala Kadhai in Tamil), with the characterisation of King Vikramadithyan and the celestial spirit Vedhalam derived from that plot. The title of the film was also derived from the two key characters from the folktale.[8][9][10] Pushkar and Gayathri continued to develop the script throughout 2015, while working on the post-production works of Sudha Kongara's Irudhi Suttru (2016), where they networked with actor Madhavan. In February 2016, Madhavan confirmed that he was working on the film and had begun research to portray an encounter specialist. He revealed that he would undergo arms training and meet people involved with the police and defence forces, before the shoot of the film started.[11][12]\\r\\nRookie actor Kathir was selected to play a third leading role of Vijay Sethupathi's brother, while Malayalam actor Hareesh Peradi also joined the team.[13] Meanwhile, actresses Shraddha Srinath and Varalaxmi Sarathkumar were signed to play the leading female roles in the film.[14][15] John Vijay was also signed to portray a role during late 2016, and revealed he would portray a gangster who will be seen in three different time stages throughout the film.[16][17] However he was later replaced by Vivek Prasanna in the role, as he became busy with his commitments for the Malayalam film Comrade in America (2017).[18] Sam C. S. was signed on as music composer, while Richard Kevin and P. S. Vinod were announced as editor and cinematographer, respectively. For their respective roles in the film, Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi sported new looks. Madhavan prepared to sport a trimmed beard with facial hair reaching his cheekbones, while Vijay Sethupathi prepared himself to portray an aged gangster with greying hair.[19][20]\\r\\nThe shoot subsequently began on 15 November 2016 in Kasimedu, North Chennai with scenes featuring Vijay Sethupathi, Kathir and Varalaxmi shot first for a period of five days.[21] After a brief schedule break, the shoot resumed in late November 2016 with Madhavan joining the team to film scenes alongside Vijay Sethupathi. Production continued throughout December 2016, with Vijay Sethupathi finishing his work on the film in early January 2017.[22][23] The shoot resumed and was completed in February 2017 with more scenes shot depicting Madhavan as a police officer with Shraddha Srinath joining the team. A first-look poster and a teaser were also released during the same month, drawing praise from media outlets.[24][25] Post-production and dubbing work on the film began in March 2017.[26][27] A theatrical trailer for the film was released by actors Shahrukh Khan and Sivakarthikeyan on 22 June 2017.[28][29]\\r\\nThe original songs and background score were composed by Sam C. S. Sam had previously worked for Pushkar and Gayathri in commercials and they consequently chose to recruit him to work on Vikram Vedha after they were impressed with his work in the 2015 album Mellisai.[30] The directors had initially opted against including songs in the film, but felt that lyrics may work better than solely music, so changed their decision. For his work in the film, Sam composed the background music for the script first rather than after watching the edited version of the film.[31][32] Subsequently, he had composed 80 per cent of the music of Vikram Vedha before the team went to shoot, and Pushkar and Gayatri shot the scenes to this score. After the shoot of the film, he later accordingly fine-tuned the score to achieve better results.[31][33]\\r\\nThe soundtrack has four original songs and six instrumental tracks that form the score of the film. Prior to the release of the album, the track \\"Tasakku Tasakku\\" was released as a single on 5 June 2017, while a second single \\"Yaanji\\" was released a week later. The album was digitally released on 16 June 2017 to positive reviews from critics. A reviewer from The Times of India gave the album a positive review citing \\"though Sam has proven his mettle with his earlier albums, the composer hits the high-note with this one\\", adding \\"with the number of instrumental songs in the album, the film's narrative is sure to up the experience through music\\".[34] Likewise, Behindwoods.com's reviewer wrote it was \\"an innovative, genre specific album that has the depth and soul from composer Sam C. S.\\"[35]\\r\\nOriginal tracklist\\r\\nVikram Vedha was initially given an \\"A\\" certificate by the Central Board of Film Certification, but the producers then successfully approached the revising committee to get a \\"U/A\\" certificate to appeal to family audiences and for television channels to show interest in procuring the film's satellite rights. The move delayed the film, as did the theatre owners' strike of July 2017 across Tamil Nadu, prompting the scheduled release date to shift from 7 July 2017 to a later date. The producers also further delayed the film to allow the makers of Vanamagan (2017) and Ivan Thanthiran (2017) to recoup from losses suffered during the strike. [36][37][5] Vikram Vedha was subsequently released worldwide on 21 July 2017.The satellite rights of the film were sold to Zee Tamizh.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nVikram Vedha opened to positive reviews from critics and audiences, with several Tamil film industry personalities also showing appreciation for the film.[39][40] Manoj Kumar of The Indian Express labelled it as \\"by far the best film to release in Tamil this year so far\\" adding readers \\"not to miss the film\\".[41] The Hindustan Times's Karthik Kumar called it \\"a film to remember\\", \\"a must watch\\" and \\"path-breaking\\", while adding \\"not only is the film entertaining from start to finish, its equally engaging and it succeeds in piquing the intellect of audiences like no recent Tamil film\\".[42] Likewise India Today's Srivatsan wrote Vikram Vedha is a \\"smartly-written thriller, which has a texture, well-developed character arcs and filmmaking gimmickry\\" and the Deccan Chronicle stated it was \\"a nuanced and well-rounded film in the deadly combo of Madhavan and Sethupathi and a definite highlight of 2017\\".[43][44] Sify.com's reviewer stated it was a \\"a brilliantly written intense crime drama\\", with the \\"icing on the cake being the brilliant actors, a terrific storyline and ingenious characterization\\", concluding it was a \\"must watch\\".[45] Furthermore, Vishal Menon of The Hindu wrote the film was \\"a terrific exploration of good, evil and everything in between\\", while Suganth of The Times of India stated \\"generally, the term well-crafted film is used to describe a film that has been made well, but with Vikram Vedha, it applies to not just the filmmaking, but the script, too\\".[46] Tamil film actors including Rajinikanth, Suriya and Siddharth also praised the film.[47][40]\\r\\nThe film became a commercial success at the box office, becoming the second biggest grossing Tamil film of the year after Baahubali 2 (2017) at the time of its release.[48] Made at a budget of 11 crore rupees, the film grossed ten crores in Tamil Nadu alone within the first weekend, earning seventeen crores worldwide.[49] Within a week of its release, the film had grossed over forty crores worldwide.[50][51] Vikram Vedha continued to perform well in its second week, outperforming new releases at the Chennai box office.[52] The film ran for over fifty days in Chennai.[53] It also went on to become the most profitable Tamil film in their careers for directors Pushkar and Gayathri, producer Sashikanth and actors Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi.[54] The film also performed well in the USA, becoming the highest grossing Tamil film of the year by earning over $360,000 by the end of the first week.[55][56]\\r\\nFollowing the release of the film, Pushkar and Gayathri revealed there had been demand from the public for a sequel. They added that a second part to the film could materialise if the lead actors accepted to be a part of the film.[57] Before the release of the film, Madhavan also expressed an interest in remaking the film in Hindi with adaptations made to the film's setting.[58][59]\\r\\nOn 15 March 2018, the directors PushkarÿGayathri and producer Y NOT Studios announced that a Hindi remake was on cards in association with Reliance Entertainment and Neeraj Pandey. Neeraj Pandey would act as a producer, along with Sashikanth of Y Not Studios and Reliance Entertainment, and would also be a writer for the remake.

This includes athletes with mobility disabilities, amputations, blindness, and cerebral palsy. The Winter Paralympic Games are held every four years directly following the Winter Olympic Games. The Winter Paralympics are also hosted by the city that hosted the Winter Olympics. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) oversees the Winter Paralympics. Medals are awarded in each event: with gold medals for first place, silver for second and bronze for third, following the tradition that the Olympic Games started in 1904.\\r\\nThe Winter Paralympics began in 1976 in ?rnsk?ldsvik, Sweden. Those Games were the first Paralympics (Summer or Winter) that featured athletes other than wheelchair athletes. The Games have expanded and grown to be (along with the Summer Games) part of the largest international sporting event after the Olympic Games. Given their expansion, the need for a very specific classification system has arisen. This system has also given rise to controversy and opened the door for cheating. Winter Paralympians have also been convicted of steroid use and other forms of cheating unique to Paralympic athletes, which has tainted the integrity of the Games.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origins of the Winter Paralympics are similar to the Summer Paralympics. Injured soldiers returning from World War II sought sports as an avenue to healing.[1] Organized by Dr. Ludwig Guttmann, sports competitions between British convalescent hospitals began in 1948 and continued until 1960 when a parallel Olympics was held in Rome after the 1960 Summer Olympics. Over 400 wheelchair athletes competed at the 1960 Paralympic Games, which became known as the first Paralympics.[1]\\r\\nSepp Zwicknagl, a pioneer of snow sports for disabled athletes, was a double-leg amputee Austrian skier who experimented skiing using prosthetics. His work helped pioneer technological advances for people with disabilities who wished to participate in winter sports.[2] Advances were slow and it was not until 1974 that the first official world ski competition for physically impaired athletes, featuring downhill and a cross-country skiing, was held.[2] The first Winter Paralympics were held in 1976 at ?rnsk?ldsvik, Sweden from February 21ÿ28. Alpine and Nordic skiing for amputees and visually impaired athletes where the main events but ice sledge racing was included as a demonstration event.[2] There were 198 participating athletes from 16 countries,[3] and it was the first time athletes with impairments other than wheelchair athletes were permitted to compete.[4]\\r\\nStarting in 1988 the Summer Paralympics were held in the same host city as the Summer Olympic Games. This was due to an agreement reached between the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). The 1992 Winter Paralympics were the first Winter Games to use the same facilities as the Winter Olympics.[4]\\r\\nAthletes have cheated by over-representing impairment to have a competitive advantage, and the use of performance-enhancing drugs.[5][6] German skier Thomas Oelsner became the first Winter Paralympian to test positive for steroids in 2002. He had won two gold medals in the alpine events but was stripped of his medals.[7] One concern now facing Paralympic officials is the technique of boosting blood pressure, known as autonomic dysreflexia. The increase in blood pressure can improve performance by 15% and is most effective in the endurance sports such as cross-country skiing. To increase blood pressure athletes will deliberately cause trauma to limbs below a spinal injury. This trauma can include breaking bones, strapping extremities in too tightly and using high-pressured compression stockings. The injury is painless to the athlete but affects the body and impacts the athlete's blood pressure, as can techniques like allowing the bladder to overfill.[8]\\r\\nInternational Paralympic Committee (IPC) found evidence that the Disappearing Positive Methodology was in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi.[9] On 7 August 2016, the IPC's Governing Board voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, citing the Russian Paralympic Committee's inability to enforce the IPC's Anti-Doping Code and the World Anti-Doping Code which is \\"a fundamental constitutional requirement\\".[9] IPC President Sir Philip Craven stated that the Russian government had \\"catastrophically failed its Para athletes\\".[10] IPC Athletes' Council Chairperson Todd Nicholson said that Russia had used athletes as \\"pawns\\" in order to \\"show global prowess\\".[11]\\r\\nThe IPC has established six disability categories applying to both the Summer and Winter Paralympics. Athletes with one of these physical disabilities are able to compete in the Paralympics though not every sport can allow for every disability category.[12]\\r\\nWithin the six disability categories the athletes still need to be divided according to their level of impairment. The classification systems differ from sport to sport. The systems are designed to open up Paralympic sports to as many athletes as possible, who can participate in fair competitions against athletes with similar levels of ability. The closest equivalents in able-bodied competitions are age classifications in junior sports, and weight divisions in wrestling, boxing, and weightlifting. Classifications vary in accordance with the different skills required to perform the sport. The biggest challenge in the classification system is how to account for the wide variety and severity of disabilities. As a result, there will always be a range of impairment within a classification.[13] What follows is a list of the Winter Paralympic sports and a general description of how they are classified.\\r\\nAlpine skiing: There are two events in alpine skiing: slalom and giant slalom. Alpine skiing accommodates athletes with the following physical limitations: spinal injury, Cerebral Palsy, amputation, Les Autres and blindness/visual impairment. There are eleven classifications, seven for standing athletes, three for sitting athletes, and three for visually impaired athletes. The divisions are defined by the degree of the athletes' function and the need for assistive equipment (prosthesis, ski poles, etc.).[14] Snowboard Cross is technically now included in this category, though competition will take place with only limited classifications (see below).\\r\\nBiathlon: Biathlon is a combination of cross-country skiing with target shooting. It requires physical stamina and accurate shooting. The events are open to athletes with physical disabilities and visual impairments. There are fifteen classes in which athletes will be placed depending on their level of function. Twelve divisions are for athletes with a physical impairment and three divisions are for athletes with a visual impairment. The athletes compete together and their finishing times are entered into a formula with their disability class to determine the athletes' overall finish order. Visually impaired athletes are able to compete through the use of acoustic signals. The signal intensity varies depending upon whether or not the athlete is on target.[15]\\r\\nCross-country skiing: Cross-country skiing, also known as Nordic skiing is open to athletes with Cerebral Palsy, amputations, the need for a wheelchair, visual impairment and intellectual impairment. There are fifteen classifications, three for visually impaired athletes, nine for standing athletes and three for seated athletes. The divisions are determined in a similar fashion to alpine skiing with attention given to the athletes' level of function and need for assistive devices.[16]\\r\\nIce Sledge Hockey: Ice sledge hockey is open only to male competitors with a physical disability in the lower part of their body. The game is played using international hockey rules with some modifications. Athletes sit on sledges with two blades that allow the puck to go beneath the sledge. They also use two sticks, which have a spike-end for pushing and a blade-end for shooting. The athletes are classified into three groups: group 1 is for athletes with no sitting balance or with major impairment in both upper and lower limbs, group 2 is for athletes with some sitting balance and moderate impairment in their extremities and athletes in group 3 have good balance and mild impairment in their upper and lower limbs.[17]\\r\\nWheelchair curling: Wheelchair curling is a coed team event for athletes with permanent lower limb disabilities that require them to use a wheelchair in their daily lives. Athletes with Cerebral Palsy or Multiple Sclerosis can also play if they use a wheelchair. Delivery of the stone can be by hand release or the use of a pole. There are no classifications in this event except the requirement that all athletes participating must have need for a wheelchair for daily mobility.[18]\\r\\nPara-snowboarding: On 2 May 2012, the International Paralympic Committee officially sanctioned \\"para-snowboarding\\" (commonly known as adaptive snowboarding) as a medal event in the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games under Alpine Skiing. There will be men's and women's standing snowboard-cross competitions.[19] The IPC currently recognizes two broader sport classes, one for competitors with lower-limb impairments and one for those with upper-limb impairments. Visually impaired classes are not currently recognized and the sport's debut in the 2014 Sochi Paralympics will feature events for only athletes with lower-limb impairments, who will be permitted to wear a prosthesis. The events will be run in a time trial format (one rider on course at a time), and results within each broad class calculated without factors that adjust raw times based on disability classification (for example, a hypothetical athlete with a single above-knee amputation will not receive any adjustment to his or her start-to-finish time, even though the lack of a knee and functional quadriceps in one leg can result in an impairment much greater than a hypothetical athlete with a single below-knee amputation but two functional quadriceps). However, as the sport develops, the classes will be expanded and/or refined in the future.[20]\\r\\nA number of different sports have been part of the Paralympic program at one point or another.\\r\\n??This color indicates a discontinued sport\\r\\nWith reference to the top ten nations and according to official data of the International Paralympic Committee.","input":"Where was the first winter paralympic games held?"},{"output":"Sanchita Bhattacharya","context":"Sa Re Ga Ma Pa L'il Champs, a sub-series of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa, is a singing competition television series, which airs on Zee TV.

The first table charts the age of each United States president at the time of presidential inauguration (first inauguration if elected to multiple and consecutive terms), upon leaving office, and at the time of death.

The first figure is the number of days between the president's date of birth and date of death, allowing for leap days; in parentheses, the same period is given in years and days, with the years being the number of whole years that the president lived, and the days being the number of days since the last birthday. Where the president is still living, their lifespan is calculated up to October 31, 2017.

He surpassed Ronald Reagan for this distinction on November 11, 2006, 45 days prior to his death. (Reagan had surpassed the longevity of the nation's second president, John Adams, on October 12, 2001.) The shortest-lived president to have died by natural causes (thereby excluding John F. Kennedy and James A. Garfield, who were both assassinated) was James K. Polk, who died at the age of 7004195830000000000?53?years, 225?days; only 103 days after leaving office.\\r\\nSince 1797, when George Washington's service as president ended, there have been five periods in American history where the only living president was the incumbent president.\\r\\nThe greatest number of presidentsformer presidents plus the incumbentalive at any given time is six, which has happened four times.\\r\\nSix U.S. presidents have lived into their 90s.

Herbert Hoover became the oldest living president (while still president himself) when Calvin Coolidge died in January 1933, and retained this distinction until his death 31 years later. Lyndon B. Johnson became the oldest living president upon the death of Harry S. Truman in December 1972 but held this distinction for only 27 days.\\r\\nOn three occasions the oldest living president lost this distinction not by his death, but by the election of a president who was older. Theodore Roosevelt (born 1858) lost this distinction when William Taft (born 1857) was inaugurated, then four years later Taft lost it when Woodrow Wilson (born 1856) was inaugurated. More recently, Richard Nixon (born 1913) ceased being the oldest living president when Ronald Reagan (born 1911) was inaugurated. Furthermore, although Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest ever to become both the oldest living president (at age 50) and a former president (at age 51), he was the only living president or former president by the end of his term. Consequently, Taft was the oldest living president twice: first during his presidency (having succeeded the younger Roosevelt), and a second time after Wilson (his successor as president but an older man) died. Gerald Ford was the oldest individual to acquire this distinction at the age of 90.\\r\\nOn seven occasions, the oldest living president has acquired this distinction during his term in office. In the cases of John Adams, Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover and Richard Nixon, this happened at the same time as their becoming the only living president; in the cases of Andrew Jackson and Benjamin Harrison, the only other living president at the time was a younger predecessor (John Quincy Adams and Grover Cleveland respectively).","input":"Who is the oldest elected united states president?"},{"output":"Fox Filmed Entertainment","context":"Most Watched, Most Trusted\\r\\nFox News (officially known as the Fox News Channel, commonly abbreviated to FNC) is an American basic cable and satellite television news channel owned by the Fox Entertainment Group, a subsidiary of 21st Century Fox. The channel broadcasts primarily from studios at 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York City, New York.\\r\\nThe channel was created by Australian-American media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who hired former Republican Party media consultant and CNBC executive Roger Ailes as its founding CEO.[1] It launched on October 7, 1996,[2] to 17 million cable subscribers.[3] Fox News grew during the late 1990s and 2000s to become a dominant cable news network in the United States.[4] Rupert Murdoch is the current chairman and acting CEO of Fox News.[5]\\r\\nFox News Channel has been accused of biased reporting, and promoting the Republican Party.[6][7][8] Research shows that Fox News increases Republican vote shares among viewers.[9][10] Critics have cited the channel as detrimental to the integrity of news overall.[11][12] Fox News employees have responded that news reporting operates independently of its opinion and commentary programming, and have denied bias in news reporting.[13] The network has also been accused of permitting sexual harassment and racial discrimination by on-air hosts, executives, and employees, paying out millions of dollars in legal settlements.[14] The company is currently under federal investigation for its harassment settlements and other alleged misconduct.[15]\\r\\nAs of February 2015, approximately 94,700,000 US households (81.4% of cable, satellite & telco customers) receive the Fox News Channel.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1985, Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch announced that he and American industrialist and philanthropist Marvin Davis intended to develop \\"a network of independent stations as a fourth marketing force\\" to compete directly with CBS, NBC, and ABC through the purchase of six television stations owned by Metromedia.[17] In July 1985, 20th Century Fox announced that Murdoch had completed his purchase of 50 percent of Fox Filmed Entertainment, the parent company of 20th Century Fox Film Corporation.[18] A year later, 20th Century Fox earned $5.6 million in its fiscal third period ended May 31, 1986, in contrast to a loss of $55.8 million in the third period of the previous year.[19]\\r\\nPrior to founding FNC, Murdoch had gained experience in the 24-hour news business when News Corporation's BSkyB subsidiary began Europe's first 24-hour news channel (Sky News) in the United Kingdom in 1989.[20] With the success of his fourth network efforts in the United States,[21] experience gained from Sky News and the turnaround of 20th Century Fox, Murdoch announced on January 31, 1996, that News Corp. would launch a 24-hour news channel on cable and satellite systems in the United States as part of a News Corp. \\"worldwide platform\\" for Fox programming: \\"The appetite for news?ÿ particularly news that explains to people how it affects them?ÿ is expanding enormously\\".[22]\\r\\nIn February 1996, after former U.S. Republican Party political strategist and NBC executive[23] Roger Ailes left cable television channel America's Talking (now MSNBC), Murdoch asked him to start Fox News Channel. Ailes demanded five months of 14-hour workdays and several weeks of rehearsal shows before its launch on October 7, 1996.[24]\\r\\nAt its debut 17 million households were able to watch FNC;[3] however, it was absent from the media markets of New York City and Los Angeles. Rolling news coverage during the day consisted of 20-minute single-topic shows such as Fox on Crime or Fox on Politics, surrounded by news headlines. Interviews featured facts at the bottom of the screen about the topic or the guest. The flagship newscast at the time was The Schneider Report, with Mike Schneider's fast-paced delivery of the news. During the evening, Fox featured opinion shows: The O'Reilly Report (now The O'Reilly Factor), The Crier Report (hosted by Catherine Crier) and Hannity & Colmes.\\r\\nFrom the beginning, FNC has placed heavy emphasis on visual presentation. Graphics were designed to be colorful and attention-getting; this helped the viewer to grasp the main points of what was being said, even if they could not hear the host (with on-screen text summarizing the position of the interviewer or speaker, and \\"bullet points\\" when a host was delivering commentary). Fox News also created the \\"Fox News Alert,\\" which interrupted its regular programming when a breaking news story occurred.\\r\\nTo accelerate its adoption by cable providers, Fox News paid systems up to $11 per subscriber to distribute the channel.[25] This contrasted with the normal practice, in which cable operators paid stations carriage fees for programming. When Time Warner bought Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System, a federal antitrust consent decree required Time Warner to carry a second all-news channel in addition to its own CNN on its cable systems. Time Warner selected MSNBC as the secondary news channel, not Fox News. Fox News claimed that this violated an agreement (to carry Fox News). Citing its agreement to keep its U.S. headquarters and a large studio in New York City, News Corporation enlisted the help of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration to pressure Time Warner Cable (one of the city's two cable providers) to transmit Fox News on a city-owned channel.[26] City officials threatened to take action affecting Time Warner's cable franchises in the city.[27]\\r\\nDuring the September 11, 2001 attacks, Fox News was the first news organization to run a news ticker on the bottom of the screen to keep up with the flow of information that day. The ticker has remained, informing viewers about additional news which reporters may not mention on-screen and repeating news mentioned during a broadcast; it has proven popular with viewers.[28]\\r\\nFNC maintains an archive of most of its programs. This archive also includes Fox Movietone newsreels. Licensing for the Fox News archive is handled by ITN Source, the archiving division of ITN.[29]\\r\\nFNC presents a variety of programming, with up to 15 hours of live broadcasting per day in addition to programming and content for the Fox Broadcasting Company. Most programs are broadcast from Fox News headquarters in New York City (at 1211 Avenue of the Americas), in its streetside studio on Sixth Avenue in the west wing of Rockefeller Center, sharing its headquarters with sister channel Fox Business Network. Fox News Channel has eight studios at its New York City headquarters that are used for its and Fox Business' programming: Studio B (used for Fox Business programming), Studio D (which has an area for studio audiences; and is used by Outnumbered), Studio E (used for Fox & Friends, Happening Now, Your World with Neil Cavuto, and certain editions of America's News HQ), Studio F (used for The Story With Martha Maccallum, The Five, and America's Election Headquarters) Studio G (which houses Fox Business shows), Studio H (Fox News Deck used for Shepard Smith Reporting and breaking news coverage), Studio J (used for Fox & Friends First, America's Newsroom, Hannity and Justice with Judge Jeanine) and the Web Studio (used for Fox News Live internet shows).\\r\\nThe remaining programs (such as Special Report with Bret Baier, On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren, and editions of America's News HQ not broadcast from the New York City studios) are broadcast from Fox News's Washington, D.C. studio, located on Capitol Hill across from Union Station in a secured building shared by a number of other television networks (including NBC News and C-SPAN). Audio simulcasts of the channel are aired on XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio.\\r\\nIn an October 11, 2009 New York Times article, Fox articulated that its hard-news programming runs from \\"9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 to 8 p.m. on weekdays\\" and \\"[is] objective\\"; however, it makes no such claims for its other broadcasts, which primarily consist of editorial journalism and commentary.[30]\\r\\nFox News Channel began broadcasting in the 720p resolution format on May 1, 2008.[31] This format is available on all major cable and satellite providers.\\r\\nWith the growth of FNC, the company introduced a radio division, Fox News Radio, in 2003.[32] Syndicated throughout the United States, the division provides short newscasts and talk radio programs featuring personalities from the television and radio divisions. In 2006, the company also introduced Fox News Talk, a satellite radio station featuring programs syndicated by (and featuring) Fox News personalities.\\r\\nIntroduced in December 1995,[33] the Fox News website features the latest coverage (including columns by FNC television, radio and online personalities). Video clips are also available on Foxnews.com and Foxbusiness.com. Fox News Latino is the version aimed at the Hispanic audience, although presented almost entirely in English, with a Spanish section.[34]\\r\\nIn September 2008, FNC joined other channels in introducing a live streaming segment to its website: The Strategy Room, designed to appeal to older viewers. It airs weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and takes the form of an informal discussion, with running commentary on the news. Regular discussion programs include Business Hour, News With a View and God Talk.[35] In March 2009, The Fox Nation was launched as a website intended to encourage readers to post, commenting on the news.[36] Fox News Mobile is the portion of the FNC website dedicated to streaming news clips formatted for video-enabled mobile phones.[37]\\r\\nFNC saw a large ratings jump during the early stages of the US invasion of Iraq. According to some reports, at the height of the conflict Fox News had as much as a 300-percent increase in viewership (averaging 3.3 million viewers daily).[41] In 2004, FNC's ratings for its broadcast of the Republican National Convention exceeded those of the three major broadcast networks. During President George W. Bush's address, Fox News attracted 7.3 million viewers nationally; NBC, ABC, and CBS had a viewership of 5.9 million, 5.1 million and 5.0 million respectively.\\r\\nIn late 2005 and early 2006, FNC saw a brief decline in ratings. One decline was in the second quarter of 2006, when Fox News lost viewers for every prime-time program compared with the previous quarter. The audience for Special Report with Brit Hume, for example, dropped 19 percent. Several weeks later, in the wake of the 2006 North Korean missile test and the 2006 Lebanon War, Fox saw a surge in viewership and remained the #1-rated cable news channel.[42] Fox produced eight of the top ten most-watched nightly cable news shows, with The O'Reilly Factor and Hannity & Colmes finishing first and second respectively.[43]\\r\\nFNC ranked #8 in viewership among all cable channels in 2006, and #6 in 2007.[44] The channel ranked #1 during the week of Barack Obama's election (November 3ÿ9) in 2008, and reached the top spot again in January 2010 (during the week of the special Senate election in Massachusetts).[45] Comparing Fox to its 24-hour-news-channel competitors, in May 2010 the channel drew an average daily prime-time audience of 1.8 million viewers (versus 747,000 for MSNBC and 595,000 for CNN).[46]\\r\\nIn September 2009, the Pew Research Center published a report on the public view of national news organizations. In the report, 72 percent of polled Republican Fox viewers rated the channel as \\"favorable\\", while 43 percent of polled Democratic viewers and 55 percent of all polled viewers shared that opinion. However, Fox was given the highest \\"unfavorable\\" rating of all national outlets studied (25 percent of all polled viewers). The report went on to say, \\"partisan differences in views of Fox News have increased substantially since 2007\\".[47] A Public Policy Polling poll concluded in 2013 that perceptions of FNC had declined from 2010. 41% of polled voters said they trust it, down from 49% in 2010, while 46% said they distrust it, up from 37% in 2010. It was also called the \\"most trusted\\" network by 34% of those polled, more than had said the same of any other network.[48]\\r\\nOn the night of October 22, 2012, Fox set a record for its highest-rated telecast ever, with 11.5 million viewers for the third U.S. presidential debate.[49] In prime time the week before, Fox averaged almost 3.7 million viewers with a total day average of 1.66 million viewers.[50]\\r\\nIn primetime and total day ratings for the week of April 15 to 21, 2013, Fox News, propelled by its coverage of the Boston Marathon bombing, was the highest-ranked network on U.S. cable television, for the first time since August 2005, when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States.[51] January 2014 marked Fox News's 145th consecutive month as the number one rated cable news channel. During that month, Fox News beat CNN and MSNBC combined in overall viewers in both prime time hours and the total day.[52] In the third quarter of 2014, the network was the most-watched cable channel during prime time hours.[53] During the final week of the campaign for the United States elections, 2014, Fox News had the highest ratings of any cable channel, news or otherwise. On election night itself, Fox News' coverage had higher ratings than that of any of the other five cable or network news sources among viewers between 25 and 54 years of age.[54] The network hosted the first prime-time GOP candidates' forum of the 2016 campaign on August 6. The debate reached a record-breaking 24 million viewers, by far the largest audience ever for any cable news event.[55]\\r\\nAs indicated by a New York Times article, based on Nielsen statistics, Fox appears to have a mostly aged demographic.[56] In 2008, in the 25ÿ54 age group, Fox News had an average of 557,000 viewers, but dropped to 379,000 in 2013 while increasing its overall audience from 1.89 million in 2010 to 2.02 million in 2013. The median age of a prime-time viewer was 68 as of 2015.[57]\\r\\nFox News Channel originally used the slogan \\"Fair and Balanced\\", which was coined by network co-founder Roger Ailes while the network was being established. The New York Times described the slogan as being both a \\"blunt signal that Fox News planned to counteract what Mr. Ailes and many others viewed as a liberal bias ingrained in television coverage by establishment news networks.\\"[58][59]\\r\\nIn August 2003, Fox sued comedian Al Franken over his use of the slogan as a subtitle for his book, Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right, which is critical of Fox News Channel.[60] The lawsuit was dropped three days later, after Judge Denny Chin refused its request for an injunction. In his decision, Chin ruled the case was \\"wholly without merit, both factually and legally\\". He went on to suggest that Fox News' trademark on the phrase \\"fair and balanced\\" could be invalid.[61] In December 2003, FNC won a legal battle concerning the slogan, when AlterNet filed a cancellation petition with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to have FNC's trademark rescinded as inaccurate. AlterNet included the documentary film Outfoxed as supporting evidence in its case.[62] After losing early motions, AlterNet withdrew its petition; the USPTO dismissed the case.[63] In 2008, FNC used the slogan \\"We Report, You Decide\\", referring to \\"You Decide 2008\\" (FNC's original slogan for its coverage of election issues).\\r\\nIn August 2016, Fox News Channel began to quietly phase out the \\"Fair and Balanced\\" slogan in favor of \\"Most Watched, Most Trusted\\"; when these changes were reported in June 2017 by Gabriel Sherman (a writer who had written a biography on Ailes), a network executive stated that the change \\"has nothing to do with programming or editorial decisions.\\" It was speculated by media outlets that Fox News Channel was wishing to distance itself from Ailes' tenure at the network.[58][64][59]\\r\\nFox News Channel has been widely criticized for biased reporting in favor of conservative political positions[65][66][6] and the Republican Party.[7] A 2008 study found that Fox News gave disproportionate attention to polls that showed low approval for President Bill Clinton.[67] A 2009 study found that Fox News was less likely to pick up stories that reflected well on Democrats, and more likely to pick up stories that reflected well on Republicans.[68] A 2010 study comparing Fox News Channel's Special Report With Brit Hume and NBC's Nightly News coverage of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan during 2005 concluded that \\"Fox News was much more sympathetic to the administration than NBC\\", suggesting that \\"if scholars continue to find evidence of a partisan or ideological bias at FNC... they should consider Fox as alternative, rather than mainstream, media\\".[69]\\r\\nResearch also shows that Fox News increases Republican vote shares and makes Republican politicians more partisan.[9][10][70][71] A 2007 study, using the introduction of Fox News into local markets (1996-2000) as an instrumental variable, found that in the 2000 presidential election \\"Republicans gained 0.4 to 0.7 percentage points in the towns that broadcast Fox News\\", suggesting that \\"Fox News convinced 3 to 28 percent of its viewers to vote Republican, depending on the audience measure\\".[10] These results were confirmed by a 2015 study.[71] A 2014 study, using the same instrumental variable, found that congressional \\"representatives become less supportive of President Clinton in districts where Fox News begins broadcasting than similar representatives in similar districts where Fox News was not broadcast.\\"[70] A 2017 study, using channel positions as an instrumental variable, found that \\"Fox News increases Republican vote shares by 0.3 points among viewers induced into watching 2.5 additional minutes per week by variation in position.\\"[9] Another 2014 paper found that Fox News viewing increased Republican vote shares among voters who identified as Republican or independent.[72]\\r\\nFox News publicly denies that it is biased, with Murdoch and Ailes saying have included Murdoch's statement that Fox has \\"given room to both sides, whereas only one side had it before\\".[73] Fox News host Chris Wallace has said, \\"I think we are the counter-weight [to NBC News] ... they have a liberal agenda, and we tell the other side of the story.\\"[74] In 2004, Robert Greenwald's documentary film Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism argued that Fox News had a conservative bias and featured clips from Fox News and internal memos from editorial vice president John Moody directing Fox News staff on how to report certain subjects.[75][76]\\r\\nA leaked memo from Fox News vice president Bill Sammon to news staff at the height of the health care reform in the United States debate has been cited as an example of the pro-Republican Party bias of Fox News. His memo asked the staff to \\"use the term 'government-run health insurance,' or, when brevity is a concern, 'government option,' whenever possible\\". The memo was sent shortly after Republican pollster Frank Luntz advised Sean Hannity on his Fox show that \\"If you call it a public option, the American people are split. If you call it the government option, the public is overwhelmingly against it\\".[77]\\r\\nSurveys show that Fox News is widely perceived to be ideological. A 2009 Pew survey found that Fox News is viewed as the most ideological channel in America, with 47 percent of those surveyed said Fox News is \\"mostly conservative\\", 14 percent said \\"mostly liberal\\" and 24 percent said \\"neither\\". In comparison, MSNBC had 36 percent identify it as \\"mostly liberal\\", 11 percent as \\"mostly conservative\\" and 27 percent as \\"neither\\". CNN had 37 percent describe it as \\"mostly liberal\\", 11 percent as \\"mostly conservative\\" and 33 percent as \\"neither\\".[78] A 2004 Pew Research Center survey showed that FNC was cited (unprompted) by 69 percent of national journalists as a conservative news organization.[79] A Rasmussen poll found that 31 percent of Americans felt that Fox News had a conservative bias, and 15 percent that it had a liberal bias. The poll also reported that 36 percent believed Fox News delivers news with neither a conservative or liberal bias, compared with 37 percent who said NPR delivers news with no conservative or liberal bias and 32 percent who said the same of CNN.[80]\\r\\nDavid Carr, media critic for The New York Times, praised the 2012 presidential election results coverage on Fox News for the network's response to Republican adviser and Fox News contributor Karl Rove challenging its call that Barack Obama would win Ohio and the election. Fox's prediction was correct. Carr wrote:\\r\\nOver many months, Fox lulled its conservative base with agitprop: that President Obama was a clear failure, that a majority of Americans saw [Mitt] Romney as a good alternative in hard times, and that polls showing otherwise were politically motivated and not to be believed. But on Tuesday night, the people in charge of Fox News were confronted with a stark choice after it became clear that Mr. Romney had fallen short: was Fox, first and foremost, a place for advocacy or a place for news? In this moment, at least, Fox chose news.[81]\\r\\nA May 2017 study conducted by Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy examined coverage of U.S. President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office by several major mainstream media outlets including Fox.[82] It found that, altogether, Trump received 80% negative coverage from the media, and that he received the least negative coverage on Fox ÿ 52% negative and 48% positive.[83]\\r\\nIn July 2017, a report by Fox & Friends falsely said that the New York Times had disclosed intelligence in one of its stories and that this intelligence disclosure helped Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, to evade capture.[84] The report cited an inaccurate assertion by Gen. Tony Thomas, the head of the United States Special Operations Command, that a major newspaper had disclosed the intelligence.[84][85] Fox News said that it was the New York Times, repeatedly running the chyron NYT FOILS U.S. ATTEMPT TO TAKE OUT AL-BAHGDADI\\".[85] Pete Hegseth, one of the show's hosts, criticized the failing New York Times.[85] President Donald Trump tweeted about the Fox & Friends report shortly after it first aired, saying The Failing New York Times foiled U.S. attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist, Al-Baghdadi. Their sick agenda over National Security.[84] Fox News later updated the story, but without apologizing to the New York Times or responding directly to the inaccuracies.[85]\\r\\nIn a Washington Post column, Erik Wemple said that Chris Wallace had covered the New York Times story himself on Fox News Sunday. \\"Heres another case of the differing standards between Fox Newss opinion operation,\\" which has given \\"a state-run vibe on all matters related to Trump,\\" compared to Fox Newss news operation, which has provided \\"mostly sane coverage.\\"[86]\\r\\nA 2011 study found that Fox News \\"takes a more dismissive tone toward climate change than CNN and MSNBC\\".[87] A 2008 study found that Fox News emphasized the scientific uncertainty of climate change more than CNN, less likely to state that climate change was real, and more likely to interview climate change skeptics.[87]\\r\\nShepard Smith has drawn attention for being one of few voices on Fox News to forcefully state that climate change is real, that human activities are a primary contributor to it and that there is a scientific consensus on the issue.[88][89] His acceptance of the scientific consensus on climate change has drawn criticism from Fox News viewers and conservatives.[90][91]\\r\\nOn March 14, 2017, Andrew Napolitano, a Fox News commentator, claimed on Fox & Friends that British intelligence agency GCHQ had wiretapped Donald Trump on behalf of Barack Obama during the 2016 United States presidential election.[92][93] On March 16, 2017, White House spokesman Sean Spicer repeated the claim.[92] When Trump was questioned about the claim at a news conference, he said \\"All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didn't make an opinion on it.\\"[94] On March 17, 2017, Shepard Smith, a Fox News anchor, acknowledged that the network had no evidence that Trump was under surveillance. British officials said the White House was backing off the claim, but the White House did not release a public statement expressing regret.[94] Napolitano was later suspended by Fox News for making the claim.[95]\\r\\nIn January 2017, the Daily Caller published a video which encouraged violence against protesters.[96][97][98] The video was subsequently reposted by Fox Nation, an offshoot of Fox News' website.[96] The video in question showed a car plowing through protesters, with the headline \\"Here's A Reel Of Cars Plowing Through Protesters Trying To Block The Road\\" and set to a cover of Ludacris' \\"Move Bitch.\\"[96] The video drew attention in August 2017 when a white supremacist plowed his car through a group of counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville.[96] After the video attracted attention, Fox News deleted it from its website.[96][98]\\r\\nOn 16 May 2017, the same day that other news organizations were extensively covering Donald Trump' revelation of classified information to Russia,[99] Fox News ran a lead story about a private investigator's uncorroborated claims about the murder of Seth Rich, a DNC staffer.[100][101][102] The private investigator asserted that he had uncovered evidence that Rich was in contact with Wikileaks and that law enforcement were covering it up.[100] The killing of Rich has given rise to conspiracy theories in rightwing circles that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party had Seth Rich killed allegedly because he was the source of the DNC leaks.[100] U.S. intelligence agencies had determined that Russia was the source of the leaks.[103] In reporting the investigator's claims, the Fox News report re-ignited right-wing conspiracy theories about the killing.[100][102]\\r\\nOther news organizations revealed that the investigator was a Donald Trump supporter and had according to NBC News \\"developed a reputation for making outlandish claims, such as?one appearance?on Fox News in 2007 in which he warned that underground networks of pink pistol-toting lesbian gangs were raping young women.\\"[100][104] The family of Seth Rich, the Washington D.C police department, the Washington D.C. mayor's office, the FBI, and law enforcement sources familiar with the case, rebuked the investigator's claims.[100][101] The family said, \\"We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seths murderers.\\"[100] The spokesperson for the family criticized Fox News for its reporting, alleging that the outlet was motivated by a desire to deflect attention from the Trump-Russia story: \\"I think theres a very special place in hell for people that would use the memory of a murder victim in order to pursue a political agenda.\\"[99] The family has called for retractions and apologies from Fox News for the inaccurate reporting.[105][106]Over the course of the day, Fox News altered the contents of the story and the headline, but did not issue corrections.[107][108]?When CNN contacted the private investigator later that day, the investigator said that he had no evidence that Rich had contacted Wikileaks.[102] The investigator claimed that he only learned about the possible existence?of the evidence from a Fox News reporter.[102] Fox News did not respond to inquiries by CNN, and the Washington Post.[102][101] Fox News later on 23 May retracted its original report, stating that the original report did not meet its standards.[109]\\r\\nNicole Hemmer, assistant professor at the?Miller Center of Public Affairs, wrote that the promotion of the conspiracy theory demonstrated how Fox News was \\"remaking itself in the image of fringe media in the age of Trump, blurring the lines between real and fake news.\\"[110] Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations said that while intent behind Fox News, as a counterweight to the liberal media was laudable, the culmination of those efforts have been to create an alternative news source that promotes hoaxes and myths, of which the promotion of the Seth Rich conspiracy is an example.[111] Fox News was also criticized by conservative outlets, such as the Weekly Standard,[112] National Review,[113][114] and conservative columnists, such as Jennifer Rubin,[115] Michael Gerson,[116] and John Podhoretz.[117]\\r\\nIn September 2009, the Obama administration engaged in a verbal conflict with Fox News Channel. On September 20, President Obama appeared on all major news programs except Fox News, a snub partially in response to remarks about the president by commentators Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity, and Fox coverage of Obama's health-care proposal.[118][119]\\r\\nIn late September 2009, Obama senior advisor David Axelrod and Roger Ailes met in secret to attempt to smooth out tensions between the two camps. Two weeks later, White House officials referred to FNC as \\"not a news network\\", communications director Anita Dunn stating that \\"Fox News often operates as either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party\\".[120][121] President Obama observed, \\"If media is operating basically as a talk radio format, then that's one thing, and if it's operating as a news outlet, then that's another\\".[122] White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel stated that it was important \\"to not have the CNNs and the others in the world basically be led in following Fox\\".[123]\\r\\nWithin days, it was reported that Fox had been excluded from an interview with administration official Ken Feinberg, with bureau chiefs from the White House press pool (ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN) coming to Fox's defense.[124] A bureau chief stated, \\"If any member had been excluded it would have been the same thing, it has nothing to do with Fox or the White House or the substance of the issues\\".[125] Shortly after the story broke, the White House admitted to a low-level mistake, saying that Fox had not made a specific request to interview Feinberg. Fox White House correspondent Major Garrett responded by stating that he had not made a specific request, but that he had a \\"standing request from me as senior White House correspondent on Fox to interview any newsmaker at the Treasury at any given time news is being made\\".[126]\\r\\nOn November 8, 2009, the Los Angeles Times reported that an unnamed Democratic consultant was warned by the White House not to appear on Fox News again. According to the article, Anita Dunn claimed in an e-mail to have checked with colleagues who \\"deal with TV issues\\" and had been told that nobody had been instructed to avoid Fox. Patrick Caddell, a Fox News contributor and former pollster for President Jimmy Carter, said he had spoken with other Democratic consultants who had received similar warnings from the White House.[127]\\r\\nOn October 2, 2013, Fox News host Anna Kooiman cited on the air a fake story from the National Report parody site, which claimed that President Obama had offered to keep the International Museum of Muslim Cultures open with cash from his own pocket.[128][129][130]\\r\\nVarious Fox News hosts and contributors defended President Trump's remarks that \\"many sides\\" were to blame for violence at a gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia.[131][132] Some Fox News hosts and contributors criticized Trump.[133][132] In a press conference on 15 August, Trump used the term \\"alt-left\\" to describe counterprotesters at the white supremacist rally, a term which had been used in Fox News' coverage of the white supremacist rally.[131] Several of Trump's comments at the press conference mirrored those appearing earlier on Fox News.[134]\\r\\nFox News contributor Laura Ingraham offered a partial defense of Trump, saying that Trump was right to point out \\"the evil of a far left that is trying to tear down both history and intimidate free speech in the country.\\"[131] On the day of Trump's press conference, Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity focused their shows on criticizing liberals and the media.[133] The next day, Hannity focused his show on the racist past of the Democratic Party, as well as \\"left-wing acceptance of black radicalism\\".[132] Fox News host Tucker Carlson also covered historical figures, such as Thomas Jefferson, Mohammed, Simon Bolivar and Plato, who owned slaves on his show, and said that individuals who wanted to remove confederate monuments would want to remove statues of Abraham Lincoln next.[131][133][135] Carlson also questioned whether it was a violation of the First Amendment for businesses to deny services to white supremacists.[132] A guest on Tucker Carlson's show equated individuals who want to remove confederate monuments to \\"Weimar thugs\\" and the Taliban.[133] A guest on Fox & Friends equated the confederate flag with the rainbow flag, saying they \\"represent the exact same thing,\\" and the hosts of Fox & Friends did not provide a response to the guest's remarks.[136][137] The Fox & Friends host, Pete Hegseth, blamed the media for the violence at the white supremacist gathering.[138]\\r\\nAccording to Dylan Byers of CNN, Fox News' coverage on the day of the press conference \\"was heavy with \\"whataboutism\\". The average Fox viewer was likely left with the impression that the media's criticism of Trump and leftist protestors' toppling of some Confederate statues were far greater threats to America than white supremacism or the president's apparent defense of bigotry.\\"[133] Byers wrote, \\"it showed that if Fox News has a line when it comes to Trump's presidency, it was not crossed on Tuesday.\\"[133]\\r\\nThe Fox News Channel feed is available internationally via a number of providers, while Fox Extra segments provide alternate programming.[139]\\r\\nInitially, U.S. advertisements were replaced on FNC with viewer e-mail and profiles of FNC anchors set to music. In 2002, these were replaced with international weather forecasts. In 2006, the weather forecasts were replaced with Fox Extra (originally Fox News Extra, prior to the international launch of Fox Business) segments, narrated reports from Fox on a variety of topics. These reports generally concern lighter issues unrelated to current news events, and the segments are repeated. FNC also shows international weather forecasts when Fox Extra segments run short. In the United Kingdom, after a period when local commercials were inserted into breaks, Fox Extra now fills most breaks.\\r\\nIn Australia, FNC is broadcast on the dominant pay television provider Foxtel, which is 50% owned by News Corp Australia, the Australian arm of News Corp and the sister company of 21st Century Fox which owns FNC. Local cable news channel Sky News Australia is wholly owned by News Corp Australia[140] and is therefore FNC's de facto sister channel, although has formal partnerships with FNC competitor CNN as well as both ABC News and CBS News.[141]\\r\\nSince 2002, FNC has been broadcast to Brazil; however, commercials are replaced with Fox Extra. It is available in packages of Vivo TV.\\r\\nIn 2003, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) rejected a Canadian Cable Telecommunications Association (CCTA) application to bring Fox News to Canada due to concerns that Fox News U.S. and the Global Television Network were planning to create a combined American-Canadian news network. In 2004, after a Fox News U.S. executive said there were no plans to create a combined channel, the CRTC approved an application to bring Fox News to Canada.[142]\\r\\nFox News is available on cable through French internet provider Free on Canal 352. As of Spring 2017, the channel was no longer found on the provider Orange's lineup.\\r\\nIn Indonesia, It is available in Channel 335 in pay TV provider Indovision.\\r\\nBroadcast of FNC in the Republic of Ireland ended in 2017. Fox news was formerly carried by Sky.[143]\\r\\nIn Israel, FNC is broadcast on Channel 105 of the satellite provider yes, as well as being carried on Cellcom TV.[144] It is also broadcast on channel 200 on cable operator HOT.[145]\\r\\nBroadcast of FNC in the Italy ended in 2017.[143] Fox news was launched on Stream TV in 2001, and moved to SKY Italia in 2003.\\r\\nIn the Netherlands, Fox News has been carried by cable providers UPC Nederland and CASEMA, and satellite provider Canaldigitaal; all have dropped the channel in recent years. At this time, only cable provider Caiway (available in a limited number of towns in the central part of the country) is broadcasting the channel. The channel is also carried by IPTV provider KNIPPR.\\r\\nIn New Zealand, FNC is broadcast on Channel 088 of pay satellite operator SKY Network Television's digital platform. It was formerly broadcast overnight on free-to-air UHF New Zealand TV channel Prime (owned by SKY); this was discontinued in January 2010, reportedly due to an expiring broadcasting license.[146] Fox News' former parent company News Corporation has a stake in both SKY and Prime.\\r\\nIn Pakistan, Fox News Channel is available on PTCL Smart TV and a number of cable and IPTV operators.\\r\\nIn the Philippines, Fox News Channel was available on cable operator Destiny Cable channel 21 (analog)/channel 112 (digital) Now on SkyCable Channel 112 it is available only on digital platform. And now on Skycable available on High Definition Channel 211. It is also seen on Cignal Digital TV channel 131.\\r\\nBetween 2003 and 2006, in Sweden and the other Scandinavian countries, FNC was broadcast 16 hours a day on TV8 (with Fox News Extra segments replacing U.S. advertising). Fox News was dropped by TV8 and replaced by German news channel Deutsche Welle in September 2006.\\r\\nIn Singapore, FNC is broadcast on channel 702 on pay cable operator StarHub TV digital platform. It also broadcasts its sister channel, Sky News.\\r\\nIn South Africa, FNC is broadcast on channel 405 of pay satellite operator TopTV's digital platform.[147]\\r\\nBroadcast of FNC in the United Kingdom ended in 2017.

Bernie Geoffrion became the second player to reach the milestone 16 years later in 1960ÿ61. Fifty-goal seasons increased in frequency during the 1970s and 1980s as offense increased across the league. By 1980, it had been reached 24 times in NHL history; the plateau was reached 76 times in the 1980s alone.\\r\\nWayne Gretzky scored his 50th goal in his 39th game in 1981ÿ82, the fastest any player has done so. He also shares the record for most 50-goal seasons with Mike Bossy, each having reached the milestone nine times in their careers. A record fourteen players exceeded 50 goals in 1992ÿ93, after which offence declined across the league, and with it the number of players to reach the total. For the first time in 29 years, no player scored 50 goals in 1998ÿ99. Ninety-one unique players have scored 50 goals in any one NHL season, doing so a combined 186 times.\\r\\nJoe Malone scored 44 goals for the Montreal Canadiens in the NHL's inaugural season of 1917ÿ18a season with a twenty-game schedule. It was a record that stood nearly 30 years.[2] The introduction of the centre red line and permission of forward passing out of the defensive zone in 1943 increased scoring;[3] six players scored 30 goals in 1943ÿ44, the first time in league history so many players reached that total in one season.[4] Maurice Richard averaged a goal per game for Montreal in 1944ÿ45 and surpassed Malone's record late in the season.[5] He was as obsessed with reaching the 50-goal mark as his opponents were with preventing it. Richard faced opponents who repeatedly elbowed, hooked and held him in an effort to prevent him from reaching 50.[2] As a result, he scored only seven goals in his final 13 games.[6] Richard scored his 50th goal, in 50 games, in the third period of Montreal's final game of the season against the Boston Bruins.[7] The league introduced the Maurice \\"Rocket\\" Richard Trophy in his honour in 1999, and the Canadiens donated the physical trophy.[8]\\r\\nRichard's mark stood untouched for 16 seasons until Bernie Geoffrion became the second player to score 50 goals in 1960ÿ61, also for Montreal, doing so in his 62nd game of the season (and the Canadiens' 68th).[1] Early in the 1960s, Chicago Black Hawks teammates Stan Mikita and Bobby Hull began experimenting with curved blades, noticing that different bends made shots more unpredictable for goaltenders. Mikita led the NHL in scoring four times using a curved blade,[9] while Hull became the third player in NHL history to score 50 goals in 1961ÿ62. It was the first of five times he would reach the milestone.[10]\\r\\nWhile playing for Boston in the 1970s, Phil Esposito scored 50 goals in five consecutive seasons, led by a then-NHL record 76 goals in 1970ÿ71.[11] By 1980, 24 players had reached the mark.[12] Mike Bossy of the New York Islanders joined Richard as the second man in NHL history to score 50 goals in 50 games in 1980ÿ81. He did so by scoring two goals in the final five minutes of the Islanders' 50th game.[12] Bossy, who had set a league rookie-scoring record with 53 goals in 1977ÿ78, surpassed the 50-goal mark in each of his first nine NHL seasons.[13] The 1980s represented one of the highest scoring eras in NHL history:[14] on 76 occasions, a player scored 50 goals in a season.[1] Wayne Gretzky was responsible for nine of those occasions, including his league-record 92 goals in 1981ÿ82.[15] In that season, Gretzky scored five goals in his 39th game of the season to total 50, bettering Richard and Bossy by 11 games as the fastest to reach the mark.[16]\\r\\nA record 14 players scored 50 goals in 1992ÿ93.[17] Among them was Teemu Selanne, who scored 76 goals as a rookie, surpassing Bossy's record for first-year players by 23 goals.[18] Brett Hull, son of Bobby, scored over 50 goals five times in the 1990s,[19] equalling his father's totals in the 1960s. As teams shifted their focus to defensive play rather than offensive, scoring rapidly declined in the late 1990s.[20] No player scored 50 in 1998ÿ99, the first time that had happened in 29 years, excluding the lockout-shortened 1994ÿ95 NHL season.[21]\\r\\nOnly five players reached the 50-goal mark between 1999 and 2004: Pavel Bure, Joe Sakic, Jaromir Jagr, Jarome Iginla, and Milan Hejduk. Following the 2004ÿ05 lockout that cancelled the season, the league introduced numerous rule changes designed to increase scoring.[20] Five players scored 50 in 2005ÿ06; however, the number of players reaching 50 goals has decreased since. Alexander Ovechkin was the only player to do so in 2008ÿ09.[22] Ovechkin scored 50 goals for the fourth time in his career in 2009ÿ10. He was one of three players to reach the mark, joined by Steven Stamkos and Sidney Crosby.[23] Ovechkin alone reached the mark again in 2013ÿ14, 2014ÿ15, and 2015ÿ16.","input":"How many nhl players have scored 50 goals in a season?"},{"output":"Kavi Pradeep","context":"\\"Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo\\" (Hindi: ? ???? ??? ?? ?????; \\"O' people of my country\\") is a Hindi patriotic song written by Kavi Pradeep, composed by C. Ramchandra, and performed by Lata Mangeshkar. The song commemorates Indian soldiers who died during the Sino-Indian War in 1962. The song was first performed live by Mangeshkar on 27 January 1963 at the National Stadium in New Delhi in the presence of President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, on account of Republic Day (26 January) 1963, which was just two months after the end of the war.\\r\\nThe song is often rendered at patriotic occasions in India, and is one of the most prominent patriotic songs alongside Jana Gana Mana (the national anthem), Vande Mataram (the national song), and Sare Jahan se Accha.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAye Mere Watan Ke Logo was written by Kavi Pradeep to commemorate the Indian soldiers who died during the Sino-Indian War. Pradeep was deeply moved by accounts of casualties of the war. In late 1962, while taking a walk along Mahim beach in Mumbai, Pradeep received a sudden bout of inspiration. He borrowed a pen from a fellow walker, and wrote the opening stanza of the song on a foil that he ripped out from his cigarette pack. A few weeks later, Pradeep was approached by producer Mehboob Khan to write a song for a fund-raiser scheduled to be held at the National Stadium in New Delhi. Pradeep accepted the offer, but did not reveal any details about the song he intended to write. He recruited music director C. Ramchandra to write the music, and Lata Mangeshkar to perform the song. According to Pradeep's daughter, Mitul, \\"Due to some misunderstanding between Ramchandra and Lata-didi, it was to be sung by Asha Bhosale. However, my father felt nobody except Lata-didi could do justice to it. He even personally convinced her and she agreed to sing it. But with a rider - Mr Pradeep must be present at the rehearsals!\\"[1]\\r\\nAccording to Mangeshkar, \\"I suggested we format the song into a duet with me and my sister Asha (Bhosle). Pradeepji wanted it to be a solo. I insisted that we do it as a duet. In fact, Asha had even rehearsed for the song. Then, days before we were to fly to Delhi, she came to me and said, 'Didi, I'm not coming to Delhi.' I tried to convince her to change her mind arguing that her name had even been printed in the newspapers as one of the singers. But she was adamant. Composer-singer Hemant Kumar had actually orchestrated the whole project. I told Hemantda about Ashas decision to not accompany us to Delhi to perform the song. Hemantda also tried to convince Asha. Lekin who nahin manee (But she didn't relent). Then it was left to me to rehearse alone for the song.\\"[2]\\r\\nIn January 2013, Lata Mangeshkar told a TV channel that initially she had declined to sing the song as she had not enough time to rehearse it. \\"It was Pradeepji, ( Kavi Pradeep) the poet, who wrote the immortal lyrics, who came to me and asked me to sing the song. I declined, because there was no time to rehearse. You see, at that time I was working round-the-clock. To give special attention to one song seemed impossible. But Pradeepji insisted,\\" Lata said, admitting that she was very nervous before the performance. Kavi Pradeep, the man who penned lyrics of the song, couldn't witness the event. \\"My regret is that Pradeepji had not been called for the Republic Day function where I sang the song. If he was there, he would have seen with his own eyes what impact 'Ae mere watan ke logo' had,\\" Lata told.[2][3][4]\\r\\nThe song was first performed live on 27 January 1963, by Lata Mangeshkar at an event at the National Stadium in New Delhi in the presence of President S. Radhakrishnan and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, on account of Republic Day (26 January) 1963, which was just two months after the end of the war.[5] Mangeshkar sang two songs at the event, opening with the bhajan (devotional song) Allah tero naam followed by Ae mere watan ke logon.[6] The performance of the latter song moved Nehru to tears.[1][7] \\"Those who don't feel inspired by Aye mere watan ke logo don't deserve to be called a Hindustani\\", said Nehru, who was visibly moved by the song.[3][6][8]\\r\\nThe event raised ?2 lakh (equivalent to ?1.2?crore or US$180,000 in 2017) for the Army Welfare Fund.[9] The song's lyricist, Pradeep, was not invited to the performance. Pradeep performed the song for Nehru on 21 March 1963 at a function at R.M. High School in Mumbai. He also presented Nehru with the original handwritten lyrics of the song.[1][7]\\r\\nThe song received rave appreciation from across the country.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the artists and technicians involved with the song  including singers, musicians, music director, lyricist, recording studio, sound recordist  pledged the royalty of the song in perpetuity to the War Widows Fund.[10] Per Pradeep's last wishes, royalties for sale of records of the song were to be donated to war widows. In 2005, the Bombay High Court asked the music company HMV to indicate a lump sum payable to the Army Welfare Fund for the disabled and war widows from the song's royalty proceeds.[6][11]\\r\\nBrigadier Chitranjan Sawant, who served in the Sino-Indian War,[12] stated that the song inspired soldiers to withstand the difficult situations they were in.[3]\\r\\nRecalling the song in 2013, Mangeshkar stated that she never expected the song to be so successful saying, \\"Since it was not part of a film, I thought it would have a limited impact. Ae mere watan ke logon became my signature tune. No show of mine, no concert or event is complete until I sing it.\\"[6] She also stated that Pradeep was always sure of the song's success saying, \\"Only Pradeepji had faith in the song.

Mammals get their name from the Latin word mamma, \\"breast\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals, lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic components of a mature mammary gland are the alveoli (hollow cavities, a few millimeters large) lined with milk-secreting cuboidal cells and surrounded by myoepithelial cells. These alveoli join to form groups known as lobules. Each lobule has a lactiferous duct that drains into openings in the nipple. The myoepithelial cells contract under the stimulation of oxytocin, excreting the milk secreted by alveolar units into the lobule lumen toward the nipple. As the infant begins to suck, the oxytocin-mediated \\"let down reflex\\" ensues and the mother's milk is secreted? not sucked from the gland? into the baby's mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the milk-secreting tissue leading to a single lactiferous duct is called a \\"simple mammary gland\\"; in a \\"complex mammary gland\\" all the simple mammary glands serve one nipple. Humans normally have two complex mammary glands, one in each breast, and each complex mammary gland consists of 10ÿ20 simple glands. The presence of more than two nipples is known as polythelia and the presence of more than two complex mammary glands as polymastia.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaintaining the correct polarized morphology of the lactiferous duct tree requires another essential component ÿ mammary epithelial cells extracellular matrix (ECM) which, together with adipocytes, fibroblast, inflammatory cells, and others, constitute mammary stroma.[4] Mammary epithelial ECM mainly contains myoepithelial basement membrane and the connective tissue. They not only help to support mammary basic structure, but also serve as a communicating bridge between mammary epithelia and their local and global environment throughout this organ's development.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nA mammary gland is a specific type of apocrine gland specialized for manufacture of colostrum when giving birth. Mammary glands can be identified as apocrine because they exhibit striking \\"decapitation\\" secretion. Many sources assert that mammary glands are modified sweat glands.[7][8][9] Some authors dispute that and argue instead that they are sebaceous glands.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nMammary glands develop during different growth cycles. They exist in both sexes during embryonic stage, forming only a rudimentary duct tree at birth. In this stage, mammary gland development depends on systemic (and maternal) hormones,[4] but is also under the (local) regulation of paracrine communication between neighboring epithelial and mesenchymal cells by parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP).[10] This locally secreted factor gives rise to a series of outside-in and inside-out positive feedback between these two types of cells, so that mammary bud epithelial cells can proliferate and sprout down into the mesenchymal layer until they reach the fat pad to begin the first round of branching.[4] At the same time, the embryonic mesenchymal cells around the epithelial bud receive secreting factors activated by PTHrP, such as BMP4. These mesenchymal cells can transform into a dense, mammary-specific mesenchyme, which later develop into connective tissue with fibrous threads, forming blood vessels and the lymph system.[11] A basement membrane, mainly containing laminin and collagen, formed afterward by differentiated myoepithelial cells, keeps the polarity of this primary duct tree. These components of the extracellular matrix are strong determinants of duct morphogenesis.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nEstrogen and growth hormone (GH) are essential for the ductal component of mammary gland development, and act synergistically to mediate it.[13][14][15][16][17] Neither estrogen nor GH are capable of inducing ductal development without the other.[14][15][16][17] The role of GH in ductal development has been found to be mostly mediated by its induction of the secretion of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which occurs both systemically (mainly originating from the liver) and locally in the mammary fat pad through activation of the growth hormone receptor (GHR).[14][15][16][17][18] However, GH itself also acts independently of IGF-1 to stimulate ductal development by upregulating estrogen receptor (ER) expression in mammary gland tissue, which is a downstream effect of mammary gland GHR activation.[17] In any case, unlike IGF-1, GH itself is not essential for mammary gland development, and IGF-1 in conjunction with estrogen can induce normal mammary gland development without the presence of GH.[17] In addition to IGF-1, other paracrine growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-),[19] amphiregulin,[20] fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)[21] are involved in breast development as mediators downstream to sex hormones and GH/IGF-1.[22][23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring embryonic development, IGF-1 levels are low, and gradually increase from birth to puberty.[25] At puberty, the levels of GH and IGF-1 reach their highest levels in life and estrogen begins to be secreted in high amounts in females, which is when ductal development mostly takes place.[25] Under the influence of estrogen, stromal and fat tissue surrounding the ductal system in the mammary glands also grows.[26] After puberty, GH and IGF-1 levels progressively decrease, which limits further development until pregnancy, if it occurs.[25] During pregnancy, progesterone and prolactin are essential for mediating lobuloalveolar development in estrogen-primed mammary gland tissue, which occurs in preparation of lactation and nursing.[13][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrogens such as testosterone inhibit estrogen-mediated mammary gland development (e.g., by reducing local ER expression) through activation of androgen receptors expressed in mammary gland tissue,[27][28] and in conjunction with relatively low estrogen levels, are the cause of the lack of developed mammary glands in males.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nMammary gland development is characterized by the unique process by which the epithelium invades the stroma. The development of the mammary gland occurs mainly after birth. During puberty, tubule formation is coupled with branching morphogenesis which establishes the basic arboreal network of ducts emanating from the nipple.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nDevelopmentally, mammary gland epithelium is constantly produced and maintained by rare epithelial cells, dubbed as mammary progenitors which are ultimately thought to be derived from tissue-resident stem cells.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nEmbryonic mammary gland development can be divided into a series of specific stages. Initially, the formation of the milk lines that run between the fore and hind limbs bilaterally on each side of the midline occurs around embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). The second stage occurs at E11.5 when placode formation begins along the mammary milk line.  This will eventually give rise to the nipple. Lastly, the third stage occurs at E12.5 and involves the invagination of cells within the placode into the mesenchyme, leading to a mammary anlage (biology).[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primitive (stem) cells are detected in embryo and their numbers increase steadily during development [32]\\r\\n\\r\\nPostnatally, the mammary ducts elongate into the mammary fat pad. Then, starting around four weeks of age, mammary ductal growth increases significantly with the ducts invading towards the lymph node. Terminal end buds, the highly proliferative structures found at the tips of the invading ducts, expand and increase greatly during this stage. This developmental period is characterized by the emergence of the terminal end buds and lasts until an age of about 7ÿ8 weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the pubertal stage, the mammary ducts have invaded to the end of the mammary fat pad. At this point, the terminal end buds become less proliferative and decrease in size. Side branches form from the primary ducts and begin to fill the mammary fat pad. Ductal development decreases with the arrival of sexual maturity and undergoes estrous cycles (proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus). As a result of estrous cycling, the mammary gland undergoes dynamic changes where cells proliferate and then regress in an ordered fashion.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring pregnancy, the ductal systems undergo rapid proliferation and form alveolar structures within the branches to be used for milk production. After delivery, lactation occurs within the mammary gland; lactation involves the secretion of milk by the luminal cells in the alveoli. Contraction of the myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli will cause the milk to be ejected through the ducts and into the nipple for the nursing infant. Upon weaning of the infant, lactation stops and the mammary gland turns in on itself, a process called involution. This process involves the controlled collapse of mammary epithelial cells where cells begin apoptosis in a controlled manner, reverting the mammary gland back to a pubertal state.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring postmenopause, due to much lower levels of estrogen, and due to lower levels of GH and IGF-1, which decrease with age, mammary gland tissue atrophies and the mammary glands become smaller.\\r\\n\\r\\nLactiferous duct development occurs in females in response to circulating hormones. First development is frequently seen during pre- and postnatal stages, and later during puberty. Estrogen promotes branching differentiation,[34] whereas in males testosterone inhibits it. A mature duct tree reaching the limit of the fat pad of the mammary gland comes into being by bifurcation of duct terminal end buds (TEB), secondary branches sprouting from primary ducts[5][35] and proper duct lumen formation. These processes are tightly modulated by components of mammary epithelial ECM interacting with systemic hormones and local secreting factors. However, for each mechanism the epithelial cells' \\"niche\\" can be delicately unique with different membrane receptor profiles and basement membrane thickness from specific branching area to area, so as to regulate cell growth or differentiation sub-locally.[36] Important players include beta-1 integrin, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), laminin-1/5, collagen-IV, matrix metalloproteinase(MMPs), heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and others. Elevated circulating level of growth hormone and estrogen get to multipotent cap cells on TEB tips through a thin, leaky layer of basement membrane. These hormones promote specific gene expression. Hence cap cells can differentiate into myoepithelial and luminal (duct) epithelial cells, and the increased amount of activated MMPs can degrade surrounding ECM helping duct buds to reach further in the fat pads.[37][38] On the other hand, basement membrane along the mature mammary ducts is thicker, with strong adhesion to epithelial cells via binding to integrin and non-integrin receptors. When side branches develop, it is a much more pushing-forward working process including extending through myoepithelial cells, degrading basement membrane and then invading into a periductal layer of fibrous stromal tissue.[5] Degraded basement membrane fragments (laminin-5) roles to lead the way of mammary epithelial cells migration.[39] Whereas, laminin-1 interacts with non-integrin receptor dystroglycan negatively regulates this side branching process in case of cancer.[40] These complex \\"Yin-yang\\" balancing crosstalks between mammary ECM and epithelial cells \\"instruct\\" healthy mammary gland development until adult.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is preliminary evidence that soybean intake mildly stimulates the breast glands in pre- and postmenopausal women.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nSecretory alveoli develop mainly in pregnancy, when rising levels of prolactin, estrogen, and progesterone cause further branching, together with an increase in adipose tissue and a richer blood flow. In gestation, serum progesterone remains at a stably high concentration so signaling through its receptor is continuously activated. As one of the transcribed genes, Wnts secreted from mammary epithelial cells act paracrinely to induce more neighboring cells' branching.[42][43] When the lactiferous duct tree is almost ready, \\"leaves\\" alveoli are differentiated from luminal epithelial cells and added at the end of each branch. In late pregnancy and for the first few days after giving birth, colostrum is secreted. Milk secretion (lactation) begins a few days later due to reduction in circulating progesterone and the presence of another important hormone prolactin, which mediates further alveologenesis, milk protein production, and regulates osmotic balance and tight junction function. Laminin and collagen in myoepithelial basement membrane interacting with beta-1 integrin on epithelial surface again, is essential in this process.[44][45] Their binding ensures correct placement of prolactin receptors on the basal lateral side of alveoli cells and directional secretion of milk into lactiferous ducts.[44][45] Suckling of the baby causes release of the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates contraction of the myoepithelial cells. In this combined control from ECM and systemic hormones, milk secretion can be reciprocally amplified so as to provide enough nutrition for the baby.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring weaning, decreased prolactin, missing mechanical stimulation (baby suckling), and changes in osmotic balance caused by milk stasis and leaking of tight junctions cause cessation of milk production. It is the (passive) process of a child or animal ceasing to be dependent on the mother for nourishment. In some species there is complete or partial involution of alveolar structures after weaning, in humans there is only partial involution and the level of involution in humans appears to be highly individual. The glands in the breast do secrete fluid also in nonlactating women.[46] In some other species (such as cows), all alveoli and secretory duct structures collapse by programmed cell death (apoptosis) and autophagy for lack of growth promoting factors either from the ECM or circulating hormones.[47][48] At the same time, apoptosis of blood capillary endothelial cells speeds up the regression of lactation ductal beds. Shrinkage of the mammary duct tree and ECM remodeling by various proteinase is under the control of somatostatin and other growth inhibiting hormones and local factors.[49] This major structural change leads loose fat tissue to fill the empty space afterward. But a functional lactiferous duct tree can be formed again when a female is pregnant again.\\r\\n\\r\\nTumorigenesis in mammary glands can be induced biochemically by abnormal expression level of circulating hormones or local ECM components,[50] or from a mechanical change in the tension of mammary stroma.[51] Under either of the two circumstances, mammary epithelial cells would grow out of control and eventually result in cancer. Almost all instances of breast cancer originate in the lobules or ducts of the mammary glands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe breasts of the adult human female vary from most other mammals that tend to have less conspicuous mammary glands. The number and positioning of mammary glands varies widely in different mammals. The protruding teats and accompanying glands can be located anywhere along the two milk lines. In general most mammals develop mammary glands in pairs along these lines, with a number approximating the number of young typically birthed at a time. The number of teats varies from 2 (in most primates) to 18 (in pigs). The Virginia opossum has 13, one of the few mammals with an odd number.[52][53] The following table lists the number and position of teats and glands found in a range of mammals:\\r\\n\\r\\nMale mammals typically have rudimentary mammary glands and nipples, with a few exceptions: male mice do not have nipples,[56] and male horses lack nipples and mammary glands.[citation needed] The male Dayak fruit bat has lactating mammary glands.[57] Male lactation occurs infrequently in some species, including humans.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMammary glands are true protein factories[citation needed], and several labs have constructed transgenic animals, mainly goats and cows, to produce proteins for pharmaceutical use.[58] Complex glycoproteins such as monoclonal antibodies or antithrombin cannot be produced by genetically engineered bacteria, and the production in live mammals is much cheaper than the use of mammalian cell cultures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evolution of the mammary gland is difficult to explain; this is because mammary glands are typically required by mammals to feed their young. There are many theories on how mammary glands evolved. For example, it is thought that the mammary gland is a transformed sweat gland, more closely related to apocrine sweat glands.[59] Because mammary glands do not fossilize well, supporting such theories with fossil evidence is difficult. Many of the current theories are based on comparisons between lines of living mammalsmonotremes, marsupials, and eutherians. One theory proposes that mammary glands evolved from glands that were used to keep the eggs of early mammals moist[60][61] and free from infection[62][63] (monotremes still lay eggs). Other theories suggest that early secretions were used directly by hatched young,[64] or that the secretions were used by young to help them orient to their mothers.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nLactation is thought to have developed long before the evolution of the mammary gland and mammals; see evolution of lactation.\\r\\n\\r\\nCross section of the breast of a human female\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman\\r\\n\\r\\nDog\\r\\n\\r\\nCattle\\r\\n\\r\\nCat\\r\\n\\r\\nPig\\r\\n\\r\\nGoat\\r\\n\\r\\nElephant","input":"What part of the mammary gland produces milk?"},{"output":"31 May 2009","context":"Eliza Gladys \\"Millvina\\" Dean (2 February 1912 ÿ 31 May 2009) was a British civil servant and cartographer. She was the last remaining survivor of the sinking of the RMS Titanic on 15 April 1912.[1] At 2 months old, she was also the youngest passenger aboard.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDean was born in Branscombe, England, to Bertram Frank Dean (1886ÿ1912) and Georgette Eva Light (1879ÿ1975). She had an older brother, Bertram Vere Dean, born 21 May 1910. She never married and had no children.[3] Her father died on the Titanic; her mother died on 16 September 1975, aged 96; and her brother died on 14 April 1992, age 81, the 80th anniversary of the iceberg collision.\\r\\nDean's parents decided to leave the United Kingdom and emigrate to Wichita, Kansas, where her father had relatives, and his cousin owned a tobacco shop that he was going to co-own.[4] They were not supposed to be aboard the Titanic, but due to a coal strike, they were transferred onto it and boarded it as third-class passengers at Southampton, England. Dean was barely two months old when she boarded the ship. Her father felt its collision with the iceberg on the night of 14 April 1912, and after investigating, returned to his cabin, telling his wife to dress the children and go up on deck. Dean, her mother, and her brother were placed in Lifeboat 10 and were among the first third-class passengers to escape.[i] Her father, however, did not survive, and his body, if recovered, was never identified.\\r\\nAt first, Dean's mother wanted to continue on to Kansas to fulfil her husband's wish of a new life in the United States. However, after losing him and being left with two small children for whom to care, they returned to Britain aboard the RMS?Adriatic. While aboard the ship, Dean attracted considerable attention. An article in the Daily Mirror dated 12 May 1912 described the ordeal:\\r\\nMillvina and Bertram were raised mostly on pension funds and educated in Southampton schools, including The Gregg School. It was not until she was eight years old, and her mother was planning to remarry, that Dean was told she had been a passenger on the Titanic.\\r\\nDean worked for the British government during the Second World War and later as a purchaser for a local engineering firm. Other careers she held were as a cartographer, a secretary, and an assistant to a tobacconist.\\r\\nIt was not until Dean was in her seventies that she became involved in Titanic-related events. Over the years, she participated in numerous conventions, exhibitions, documentaries, radio and television interviews, and personal correspondence. In 1998, she travelled to the United States to participate in a Titanic convention in Springfield, Massachusetts, and another in 1999 in Montreal. She had also been scheduled to appear at a commemoration of the 94th anniversary of the sinking in 2006, but a broken hip prevented her appearance.[6] She also appeared in the History special Titanic's Final Moments: Missing Pieces.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn October 2007, Dean became the last Titanic survivor following the death of Barbara West Dainton, who died at age 96 in England.[7]\\r\\nIn December 2007, Dean criticised the BBC and its television programme Doctor Who for including an episode with a starship \\"cruise liner\\" called the Titanic, that was similar in appearance to the historical liner. Speaking from her nursing home, she said: \\"The Titanic was a tragedy which tore so many families apart. I lost my father and he lies on that wreck. I think it is disrespectful to make entertainment of such a tragedy.\\"[8] A spokeswoman for the show said: \\"No offence was intended. 'Voyage of the Damned' is set on a spaceship called The Titanic and not a boat.\\"[8]\\r\\nIn April 2008, Dean had accepted an invitation to speak in Southampton at an event commemorating the 96th anniversary of the sinking, but ill health resulting from a respiratory infection forced her to cancel.[9]\\r\\nIn December 2008, at age 96, Dean was forced to sell several of her family's possessions to pay for her private medical care following a broken hip. These included a letter sent to her mother from the Titanic Relief Fund, and a suitcase given to her and her mother in New York following the sinking. Their sale raised approximately S32,000. In February 2009, she announced that she would be selling several more items to pay for her increasing medical costs which she said exceeded S3,000 a month.[10]\\r\\n97-year-old Dean died of pneumonia on the morning of 31 May 2009, 97 years and seven weeks after the Titanic sailed, at a care home in Ashurst, Hampshire.[2][11] She was cremated, and on 24 October 2009, her ashes were scattered from a launch at the docks in Southampton where the Titanic set sail.[12]\\r\\nIn response to the escalating cost of Dean's healthcare, The Millvina Fund was set up in April 2009 by the Belfast, British, and International Titanic Societies with the exclusive aim of taking care of her nursing home bills. It was given a boost by the Irish author and campaigning journalist, Don Mullan, at the opening of his worldwide Nokia photographic exhibition, A Thousand Reasons for Living, (featuring a portrait of Dean) in Dublin on 22 April 2009.[13] Mullan introduced an additional portrait of Dean's hands, as she signed a card for a Titanic autograph collector, which he produced as a limited edition of 100 copies. He made the edition available at ?500 each and then challenged the director and stars of the film Titanic (1997) - James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kate Winslet - singer Celine Dion, and the corporations Sony Music, 20th Century Fox, and Paramount Pictures to match him euro-for-euro to support her with her bills.[14][15] DiCaprio and Winslet led the way with a joint contribution of US$20,000. Cameron and Dion donated US$10,000 each.","input":"When did the last titanic survivor pass away?"},{"output":"magnesite","context":"Mining in North Korea is important to the country's economy. North Korea is naturally abundant in metals such as magnesite, zinc, tungsten, and iron; with magnesite resources of 6 billion tonnes (second largest in the world), particularly in the Hamgyeong-do and Jagang-do provinces. However, often these cannot be mined due to the acute shortage of electricity in the country, as well as the lack of proper tools to mine these materials and an antiquated industrial base.[1] Coal, iron ore, limestone, and magnesite deposits are larger than other mineral commodities. Mining joint ventures with other countries include China, Canada, Egypt, and South Korea.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth Korea has reserves of more than 200 mineral types distributed over 80% of its territory with ten reserves recording large deposits of magnetite, tungsten ore, graphite, gold ore, and molybdenum. Among the largest resources with more than 2 million tons of estimated reserve are: Zinc which tops the list with 21 million tons of estimated resource; followed by non-metallic resource of 21 million tons of limestone and magnesite 6 million tons; and other mineral sources such as iron 5 million tons, anthracite 5 million tons, copper 3 million tons, barite 2 million tons, gold and graphite also 2 million tons each.[1]\\r\\nThe Mineral Industry in the country is structured under three broad sectors namely, coal mining, ferrous and nonferrous metals mining, and processing sector and industrial minerals mining and processing sector. All these sectors are owned by the central government and it is also reported that the mineral industry supports the countrys military budget.[2]\\r\\nNorth Korea is thought to have tremendous potential metal resources (and particularly rare-earth metals), which have been valued in excess of US$6 trillion by the South Korean national mining company. There is much investment from Chinese mining companies, with an estimated $500 million investment in the last 11 years. 41% of all Chinese companies trading in North Korea are involved in mining.[3]\\r\\nThe Korea General Zinc Industry Group is a North Korean mining and industrial group headquartered in Pyongyang.[4] The organization produces zinc, lead, base bullion, lead concentrates, zinc concentrates, cadmium, arsenic, zinc residues and copper concentrate for export and domestic use.[4]\\r\\nThe Geomdeok Mine, located in Geumgol-dong, Dancheon-si, Hamgyeongnam-do, has been in operation since 1932 and is the largest zinc mine in East Asia. It has seven mine blocks extracted through 10 mines. It has annual capacity to handle 10 million tons of zinc ore. Conventional flotation methods are adopted to extract lead and zinc concentrates. Other products from the mine are sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and galena.[1]\\r\\nIn gold alone the nation is estimated to hold around 2,000 metric tonnes of reserves, which at a gold value of $1,200/ounce, would give a total worth of $84.6 billion. Other available resources include iron, with 5 billion tonnes of 50% iron-content ore in reserve, nickel, with 36,000 tonnes of the pure metal, and zinc metal, with around 21,100,000 tonnes.[1]\\r\\nThe Daebong Mine, located on the border of Gapsan and Woonheung in Yanggang Province, produced more than 150 kilograms (kg) (4,823 troy ounces) of gold annually. Further improvements are proposed in this mine with Chinese investment under a package of offer of mineral rights in exchange for capital investment in the mine.[2]\\r\\nThe Sangnong Mine, in the Dancheon district of Hamgyeongnam-do has been in operation since 1956 and is an underground mine. The mine also extracts pyrite, chalcopyrite, magnesite, native gold, and native silver. In 2008, the annual production was reported as 290,000 tons of concentrate at a grade of 30g/t. To process the low-grade concentrate of the Sangnong Mine, the Dongdae Custom Mill Plant (located in Dancheon city) has been established. This plant has processed twenty million tons of tailings and the waste piled up in the yard of the plant has still a gold pf grade of 1.44g/t.[1]\\r\\nThe Holdong Mine in the Holdong labor district in Yeonsan-gun, Hwanghaebuk-doce has been in operation since 1893. Gold and other ores are found in a strike of 1,200 metres (3,900?ft) strip. The plant has capacity for annual handling of 2 tonnes of gold, 2.5 tonnes of silver, and 80,000 tonnes of copper concentrate. In 1991, the mine recorded a production of 0.85 tonnes of gold, 1.674 tonnes of silver, and 893 tonnes of copper concentrate.[1]\\r\\nThe DPRK is estimated to hold a total amount of 2.1 million metric tonnes of copper metal.[1] The Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (KOMID) was involved in a joint-development project with a Chinese firm in the development of a copper mine in Hyesan. However, KOMID was blacklisted by the United Nations in 2009 subsequent to North Korea's April 5 rocket launch. This resulted in a halting of facility construction at Hyesan.[5] The Hyesan copper mine, located Yanggang Province would be operated by the Hyesan-China Joint Venture Mineral Co.[2]\\r\\nThe Hyesan Mine, located in Masan-dong, Hyesan-si, and Ryanggang-do, has been in operation since 1970 and is the largest copper mine in the country. It was flooded and hence closed from 1994 to 2009 and has been partially reopened, after bailing out water, since 2010. Other products from the mine are chalcocite, chalcopyrite, galena, and sphalerite. The plant has a capacity to handle 1,200,000 tons of copper ore annually. According to a 1993 report, the mine produced about 90,000 tons of concentrate of 16% grade of copper.[1]\\r\\nMusan Mine, located at Musan-gun, in the Changryeol labor districts and Hamgyeongbuk-do, is being operated by Mitsubishi Mining Company of Japan since 1935. The ore is found a strike stip of 1200 m and is operated through nine blocks and extraction is by open pit method. Its iron ore handling capacity is 10 million tons per year. The annual production is reported to be 2 million tons of iron concentrate of 65% grade. After processing at the Gimchaek Steel Mill, iron is exported to China.[1]\\r\\nThe Oryong Mine, located in Ryongcheon-ri, Hyeryeong City, in Hamgyeongbuk-do, has been in operation since 2007. Iron ore is embedded in granite formations as magnetite, hematite, and ilmenite in the Musan group and Liwon-am group of rocks, and the ore extracted in directly transported to China without milling. The ore exported in 2007 was of the order of 3,000 tons.[1]\\r\\nJeongchon Mine is a graphite mine located in Jeongchon-gun, Hamgyeongnam-do and the ore is found in strike length of 700m. Mining operation was started here in 2006. It is an inter-Korean project with South Korea getting a share of 50% of the extracted graphite.[1]\\r\\nMagnesite in the Tanchon area, a very large resource, has been under extraction since 1980 from the Taehung Youth Hero Mine and the Yongyang Mine, and the former mine is reported to be operating to its full capacity.[2]\\r\\nDaeheung Mine, located in Daeheung-dong, Dancheon-si, and Hamgyeongnamdo comprising four mine blocks has been in operation since 1982. It is reported to be the largest magnesite mine in the world. Magnesite ore is found in a strike of 1600 m and has been extracted since 1982. Both open pit and underground mining are done in these mine blocks and there is a total capacity to extract magnesite ore of 600,000 tons per year. In 2006 the production reported was 230,000 tons of magnesite of grade of up to 46.5 percent of MgO.[1]\\r\\nIn 2005, it was reported that Kimduk Combined Mining Enterprise was the country's largest nonferrous metal mine.[6]\\r\\nIn addition to its metal resources, North Korea is also abundant in coal and limestone (with 100 billion metric tonnes), valued at some US$9.7 trillion.[7] In particular the purest form of coal, anthracite, is especially abundant, with reserves of over 4.5 billion tonnes,[1] which at $143/tonne would be worth $644.8 billion.\\r\\nJikdong coal mine is an anthracite coal mine located in Jikdong, Suncheon-si, Pyongannam-do where an underground mining operation started in 1997. It has capacity to handle 1 million tons of coal per year. The coal is transported by trucks directly to run the Dongpyeongyang Thermal power plant.[1]\\r\\nGogeonwon Mine is also an anthracite coal mine located in the Gogeonwon labor district, Kyeongwongun, Hamgyeongbuk-do and has been in operation as an underground mine since 1920. It has a capacity of 1 million tons per year and the coal mined is sent by trucks to run the Cheongjin Thermal Power Plant and the Seongjin Steel Company.[1]\\r\\nIn 2013, North Korea surpassed Vietnam to become the global top exporter of anthracite, generating $1.4 billion in revenue for the DPRK (10% of the country's GDP). Another estimate puts the nation's 2015 coal exports at 19.7 million tonnes, worth $1.1 billion.[8] The regime relies on these profits to procure much of what it needs the most.[9]","input":"What are some natural resources in north korea?"},{"output":"24.45%","context":"Firearms legislation in Switzerland is comparatively liberal, more similar to gun politics in the United States than to that in most European Union countries. The reason is a long tradition of shooting (tirs) as a formative element of national identity in the post-Napoleonic Restoration of the Confederacy,[1] and the long-standing practice of a militia organization of the Swiss Army in which soldiers' service rifles are stored privately at home. In addition to this, many cantons (notably the alpine cantons of Grisons and Valais) have strong traditions of hunting, accounting for a large but unknown number of privately held hunting rifles.\\r\\nThe applicable federal legislations are SR 514.54 Federal Law on Weapons, Weapon Equipment and Ammunition (German: Waffengesetz, WG, French: Loi sur les armes, LArm, Italian: Legge sulle armi, LArm) of 20 June 1997 (current edition of 1. July 2016, revised 01.01.1999),[2] and SR 514.541 Ordinance on Weapons, Armament Accessories and Ammunition (German: Waffenverordnung, WV, French: Ordonnance sur les armes, OArm, Italian: Ordinanza sulle armi, OArm) of 2 July 2008 (current edition of 1. July 2016, revised 12.12.2008).[3] The Weapons Law recognises a qualified \\"right to acquire, possess and carry arms\\".[note 1][2]\\r\\nIt allows the free purchase of semi-automatic, but not fully automatic, firearms by Swiss citizens and foreigners with permanent residence.[note 2][3]\\r\\nPermits for concealed carrying in public are issued only extremely restrictively.[note 3][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSwitzerland thus has a relatively high gun ownership rate. There are no official statistics, and estimates vary considerably. The Small Arms Survey of 2016 placed Swiss gun ownership per capita at 24.45%.[4]\\r\\nIn 2016, the defence ministry estimated that 2 million privately owned guns are in circulation, which given a population of 8.3 million corresponds to a gun ownership rate of around 24 guns per 100 residents.[5] This is roughly a quarter of the rate in the United States, and lower than that in the neighbouring countries of Germany, and Austria, but about the double of Italy and France.[4]\\r\\nTraditionally liberal Swiss gun legislation has, however, been somewhat tightened in 2008, when Switzerland has complied with European Firearms Directive.[6] Throughout the modern political history of Switzerland, there have been advocates for tighter gun control.[7]\\r\\nThe most recent suggestion for tighter gun control was rejected in a popular referendum in February 2011.[8]\\r\\nSwitzerland's Weapons Law (WG, LArm)[2] and Weapons Act (WV, OArm)[3] has been revised to accede to the Schengen Treaty effective 12 December 2008. The Act on Personal Military Equipement (VPAA, OEPM) regulates the handling of military equipement, and in particular the handling of personal weapons by military personnel.[9]\\r\\nThe law is applied to the following weapons:\\r\\nGenerally prohibited arms are:\\r\\nIn order to purchase most weapons, the purchaser must obtain a weapon acquisition permit (art. 8 WG/LArm). Swiss citizens and foreigners with a C permit over the age of 18 who are not psychiatrically disqualified nor identified as posing security problems, and who have a clean criminal record can request such a permit. Foreigners with the following citizenship are explicitly excluded from the right to possess weapons: Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Algeria and Albania.[note 2] The following information must be provided to the cantonal weapon bureau together with the weapon application form:\\r\\nFor each transfer of a weapon or an essential weapon component without weapons acquisition permit (art. 10 WG/LArm), a written contract must be concluded. Each Party shall keep them at least ten years. The contract must include the following information (art. 11 WG/LArm):\\r\\nThis information must be sent within 30 days to the cantonal weapon registration bureau, where the weapon holders are registered (art. 9 WG/LArm).\\r\\nSome weapons do not need a weapon acquisition permit (art. 10 WG/LArm):\\r\\nIn order to purchase ammunition the buyer must follow the same legal rules that apply to buying guns. The buyer can only buy ammunition for guns that he/she legally owns and must provide the following information to the seller (art. 15, 16 WG/LArm; art. 24 WV/OArm):[2][3]\\r\\nThis also applies for weapons which do not require a weapon acquisition permit (see above, excluding the weapon acquisition permit, of course).\\r\\nThis information must be sent within 30 days to the cantonal weapon registration bureau, where the weapon holder is registered.\\r\\nThe same applies to black powder and modern black powder substitutes for use in firing historical rifles.\\r\\nThe possession of the following munition is generally prohibited:\\r\\nTo carry a firearm in public or outdoors (and for a militia member to carry a firearm other than his issued weapons while off-duty), a person must have a gun carrying permit (German: Waffentragbewilligung, French: permis de port d'armes, Italian: permesso di porto di armi; art. 27 WG/LArm), which in most cases is issued only to private citizens working in occupations such as security.[2] It is, however, quite common to see a person in military service to be en route with his rifle, albeit unloaded.[9] The issue of such exceptional permits are extremely selective.[clarification needed]\\r\\nHowever, it is permissible to carry firearms in public or outdoors if the holder (art. 27  4 WG/LArm):\\r\\nFurthermore, any licensed holder of a gun may transport an unloaded firearm for special situations (see #Transporting guns).\\r\\nThere are three conditions (art. 27  2 WG/LArm):\\r\\nThe carrying permit remains valid for a term of five years (unless otherwise surrendered or revoked), and applies only to the type of firearm for which the permit was issued. Additional constraints may be invoked to modify any specific permit. (art. 27  3 WG/LArm)\\r\\nGuns may be transported in public as long as an appropriate justification is present. This means to transport a gun in public, the following requirements apply (art. 28 WG/LArm):\\r\\nA 2017 amendment to the EU Firearms Directive, known as the \\"EU Gun Ban\\",[11][12][13][14] introduces new restrictions on firearms possession and acquisition, especially on semi-automatic firearms, personal defense weapons, magazine capacity, blank firing guns and historical firearms. The restrictions must be introduced into the Swiss legal system by August 2018 due to its membership of the Schengen area.\\r\\nThe Directive also includes an exemption covering a specific Swiss issue - it allows possession to a target shooter of one firearm used during the mandatory military period after leaving the army, provided it was converted to semi-automatic only (art. 6(6) of the Amendment Directive).[15] This part of the Directive specifically was however challenged by the Czech Republic in front of the European Court of Justice due to its discriminatory nature. The Czech Republic seeks nullification of the \\"Swiss exemption\\" as well as of other parts of the Directive.[16]\\r\\nCivil rights organizations plan to hold a referendum to reject the recent EU directive.[17] [18] According to Swiss People's Party vice-president Christoph Blocher, Switzerland should consider abandoning EU's borderless Schengen Area if the Swiss people reject the proposed measures in a referendum.[19]\\r\\nThe Swiss army has long been a militia trained and structured to rapidly respond against foreign aggression. Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school, the basic-training camp, after which Swiss men remain part of the \\"militia\\" in reserve capacity until age 30 (age 34 for officers).\\r\\nPrior to 2007 members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50-rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government. This was so that, in the case of an emergency, the militia could respond quickly.\\r\\nIn December 2007, the Swiss Federal Council decided that the distribution of ammunition to soldiers would stop and that previously issued ammo would be returned. By March 2011, more than 99% of the ammo has been received. Only 2,000 specialist militia members (who protect airports and other sites of particular sensitivity) are permitted to keep their military-issued ammunition at home. The rest of the militia get their ammunition from their military armory in the event of an emergency.[2][20][21]\\r\\nWhen their period of service has ended, militia men have the choice of keeping their personal weapon and other selected items of their equipment. However, keeping the weapon after end of service requires a weapon acquisition permit (art. 11-15 VPAA/OEPM).[9]\\r\\nThe government sponsors training with rifles and shooting in competitions for interested adolescents, both male and female. The sale of ammunition?ÿ including Gw Pat.90 rounds for army-issue assault rifles?ÿ is subsidized by the Swiss government and made available at the many Federal Council licensed shooting ranges. That ammunition sold at ranges must be immediately used there under supervision (art. 16 WG/LArm).\\r\\nThe Swiss Army maintains tightened adherence to high standards of lawful military conduct. In 2005, for example, when the Swiss prosecuted recruits who had reenacted the torture scenes of Abu Ghraib, one of the charges was improper use of service weapons.[22]\\r\\nRecreational shooting is widespread in Switzerland. Practice with guns is a popular form of recreation, and is encouraged by the government, particularly for the members of the militia.\\r\\nPrior to the turn of the century, about 200,000 people used to attend the annual Feldschiessen, which is the largest rifle shooting competition in the world. In 2012 they counted 130,000 participants.[23] For the 2015 Federal Shooting (Eidg. Schtzenfest) 37,000 shooters are registered.[24] In addition, there are several private shooting ranges which rent guns.\\r\\nSwitzerland has a strong gun culture compared to other countries in the world.[25][26] Groups like ProTell lobby for the preservation of Switzerland's gun rights. Additionally, the Schweizerischer Schtzenverein, a Swiss shooting association, organizes the Eidgen?ssische Schtzenfeste, currently in intervals of five years.\\r\\nThe vast majority of firearm-related deaths in Switzerland are suicides. The suicide method of shooting oneself with a firearm accounted for 21.5% of suicides in Switzerland in the period of 2001ÿ2012 (with significant gender imbalance: 29.7% of male suicides vs. 3.0% of female suicides).[27]\\r\\nBy contrast, gun crime is comparatively limited. In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population. Of the recorded homicides (attempted or completed), 20.3% were committed with a gun (47 cases, compared to an average of 41 cases in the period of 2009ÿ2015). In addition, there were 7 cases of bodily harm and 233 cases of robbery committed with firearms.[28]\\r\\nThere were 16 completed homicides with a firearm in 2016. Of these, 14 were committed with a handgun, one with a long gun and one case marked \\"other/unspecified\\". None of the involved weapons were ordnance weapons issued by the Swiss Armed Forces. Similarly, out of 31 attempted homicides with firearms, 25 were committed with handguns, two with long guns and four \\"other/unspecified\\", with no use of ordnance weapons on record. For the period of 2009ÿ2016, on average 16.5 out of 49.4 completed homicides were committed with a firearm, 13.8 with handguns, 1.9 with long guns and 0.9 \\"other/unspecified\\"; an average 0.75 cases per year (6 cases in eight years) involved ordnance weapons.[29]","input":"What is the gun ownership rate in switzerland?"},{"output":"magnitude 9.0ÿ9.1 (Mw)","context":"","input":"How strong was the 2011 earthquake in japan?"},{"output":"6 April 1652","context":"","input":"When did dutch settlers come to south africa?"},{"output":"patients were generally required to pay for their health care","context":"The National Health Service in England was created by the National Health Service Act 1946.

He established the State Medical Service Association which held its first meeting in 1912 and continued to exist until it was replaced by the Socialist Medical Association in 1930.[1]\\r\\nBefore the National Health Service was created in 1948, patients were generally required to pay for their health care. Free treatment was sometimes available from Voluntary Hospitals. Some local authorities operated hospitals for local ratepayers (under a system originating with the Poor Law). The London County Council (LCC) on 1 April 1930 took over from the abolished Metropolitan Asylums Board responsibility for 140 hospitals, medical schools and other medical institutions. The Local Government Act 1929 allowed local authorities to run services over and above those authorised by the Poor Law and in effect to provide medical treatment for everyone. By the outbreak of the Second World War, the LCC was running the largest public health service in Britain.[2]\\r\\nDr A. J. Cronin's controversial novel The Citadel, published in 1937, had fomented extensive criticism about the severe inadequacies of health care. The author's innovative ideas were not only essential to the conception of the NHS, but in fact, his best-selling novels are said to have greatly contributed to the Labour Party's victory in 1945.[3]\\r\\nThe Emergency Hospital Service established in 1939 gave a taste of what a National Health Service might look like.\\r\\nSystems of health insurance usually consisted of private schemes such as Friendly societies or Welfare societies. Under the National Insurance Act 1911, introduced by David Lloyd George, a small amount was deducted from weekly wages, to which was added contributions from the employer and the government. In return for the record of contributions, the workman was entitled to medical care (as well as retirement and unemployment benefits) though not necessarily to the drugs prescribed. To obtain medical care, he registered with a doctor. Each doctor in General Practice who participated in the scheme thus had a 'panel' of those who have made an insurance under the system, and was paid a capitation grant out of the fund calculated upon the number. Lloyd George's name survives in the \\"Lloyd George envelopes\\"[4] in which most primary care records in England are stored, although today most working records in primary care are at least partially computerised. This imperfect scheme only covered workers who paid their National Insurance Contributions and was known as 'Lloyd George's Ambulance Wagon'. Most women and children were not covered.\\r\\nLord Dawson was commissioned in 1919 by Lord Addison, the first British Minister of Health to produce a report on \\"schemes requisite for the systematised provision of such forms of medical and allied services as should, in the opinion of the Council, be available for the inhabitants of a given area\\". An Interim Report on the Future Provision of Medical and Allied Services[5] was produced in 1920, though no further report ever appeared. The report laid down plans for a network of Primary and Secondary Health Centres, and was very influential in subsequent debates about the National Health Service. However the fall of the Lloyd George government prevented any implementation of those ideas at that time.\\r\\nThe Labour Party in 1932 accepted a resolution moved by Somerville Hastings MP calling for the establishment of a State Medical Service and in 1934 the Labour Party Conference at Southport unanimously accepted an official document on a National Health Service.[6]\\r\\nPrior to the Second World War there was already consensus that health insurance should be extended to the dependants of the wage-earner, and that the voluntary and local authority hospitals should be integrated. A British Medical Association (BMA) pamphlet, \\"A General Medical Service for the Nation\\" was issued along these lines in 1938. However, no action was taken due to the international crisis. During the war, a new centralised state-run Emergency Hospital Service employed doctors and nurses to care for those injured by enemy action and arrange for their treatment in whichever hospital was available. The existence of the service made voluntary hospitals dependent on the Government and there was a recognition that many would be in financial trouble once peace arrived.[7] The need to do something to guarantee the voluntary hospitals meant that hospital care drove the impetus for reform.\\r\\nIn February 1941 the Deputy Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Health recorded privately areas of agreement on post-war health policy which included \\"a complete health service to be available to every member of the community\\" and on 9 October 1941, the Minister of Health Ernest Brown announced that the Government proposed to ensure that there was a comprehensive hospital service available to everyone in need of it, and that local authorities would be responsible for providing it.[8] The Medical Planning Commission set up by the professional bodies went one stage further in May 1942 recommending (in an interim report) a National Health Service with General Practitioners working through health centres and hospitals run by regional administrations.[9] The Beveridge Report of December 1942 included this same idea.\\r\\nDeveloping the idea into firm policy proved difficult. Although the BMA had been part of the Medical Planning Commission, at their conference in September 1943 the association changed policy to oppose local authority control of hospitals and to favour extension of health insurance instead of GPs working for state health centres. When Health Minister Henry Willink prepared a white paper endorsing a National Health Service, it was attacked by Brendan Bracken and Lord Beaverbrook and resignations were threatened on both sides. However the Cabinet endorsed the White Paper which was published in 1944.[10] This White Paper includes the founding principles of the NHS: it was to be funded out of general taxation and not through national insurance, and services would be provided by the same doctors and the same hospitals, but:\\r\\nWillink then set about trying to assuage the doctors, a job taken over by Aneurin Bevan in Clement Attlee's Labour Party government after the war ended. Bevan quickly came to the decision that the 1944 white paper's proposal for local authority control of voluntary hospitals was not workable, as the local authorities were too poor and too small to manage hospitals.[11] He decided that \\"the only thing to do was to create an entirely new hospital service, to take over the voluntary hospitals, and to take over the local government hospitals and to organise them as a single hospital service\\".[12] This structure of the NHS in England and Wales was established by the National Health Service Act 1946 which received Royal Assent on 6 November 1946. Bevan encountered considerable debate and resistance from the BMA who voted in May 1948 not to join the new service,[13] but brought them on board by the time the new arrangements launched on 5 July 1948.\\r\\nThe original structure of the NHS in England and Wales had three aspects, known as the tripartite system:\\r\\nThe new service instantly became Britain's 3rd largest employer with around 364,000 staff across England and Wales. These included 9,000 full-time doctors, 19,000 professional and technical staff (including 2,800 physiotherapists, 1,600 laboratory technicians and 2,000 radiographers), 25,000 administrative and clerical staff, 149,000 nurses and midwives (23,000 of whom were part-time), and 128,000 ancillary staff (catering, laundry, cleaning and maintenance).[14]\\r\\nBy the beginning of the 1950s, spending on the NHS was exceeding expectations, leading in 1952 to the introduction of a one-shilling charge for prescriptions and a S1 charge for dental treatment; these were exceptions to the NHS being free at the point of use. Political concerns about spiralling NHS costs later receded in the wake of the 1956 Guillebaud Report, which praised the \\"responsible attitude among hospital authorities\\" towards the \\"efficient and economical\\" use of public funds.[15] The 1950s saw the planning of hospital services, dealing in part with some of the gaps and duplications that existed across England and Wales. The period also saw growth in the number of medical staff and a more even distribution of them with the development of hospital outpatient services. By 1956, the NHS was stretched financially and doctors were disaffected, resulting in a Royal Commission on doctors' pay being set up in February 1957. The investigation and trial of alleged serial killer Dr John Bodkin Adams exposed some of the tensions in the system.[16] Indeed, if he had been found guilty (for, in the eyes of doctors, accidentally killing a patient while providing treatment) and hanged, the whole NHS might have collapsed.[17] The Mental Health Act of 1959 also significantly altered legislation in respect of mental illness and reduced the grounds on which someone could be detained in a mental hospital.\\r\\nThe 1960s have been characterised as a period of growth. Prescription charges were abolished in 1965 and reintroduced in 1968. New drugs came to the market improving healthcare, including polio vaccine, dialysis for chronic renal failure and chemotherapy for certain cancers were developed, all adding to upfront costs. Health Secretary Enoch Powell undertook three initiatives:\\r\\nConcern continued to grow about the structure of the NHS and weaknesses of the tripartite system. Powell agreed the creation of a Royal Commission on doctors pay, which resulted in a statutory review body. Further development came in the form of the Charter of General Practice, negotiated between new Health Minister Kenneth Robinson and the BMA, that provided financial incentives for practice development. This resulted in the concept of the primary health care in better housed and better staffed practices, stimulating doctors to join together and the development of the modern group practice.\\r\\nIn 1969, responsibility for the NHS in Wales was passed to the Secretary of State for Wales from the Secretary of State for Health who was thereafter just responsible for the NHS in England.\\r\\nAfter the publication by the British Medical Journal on 24 December 1949 of University of Cambridge consultant paediatrician Douglas Gairdner's landmark paper detailing the lack of medical benefit and the risks attached to non-therapeutic (routine) circumcision,[18] the National Health Service took a decision that circumcision would not be performed unless there was a clear and present medical indication. Both the cost and the non-therapeutic, unnecessary, harmful nature of the surgical operation were taken into account.[19]\\r\\nThe NHS in England was reorganised in 1974 to bring together services provided by hospitals and services provided by local authorities under the umbrella of Regional Health Authorities, with a further restructuring in 1982. The 1970s also saw the end of the economic optimism which had characterised the 1960s and increasing pressures coming to bear to reduce the amount of money spent on public services and to ensure increased efficiency for the money spent.\\r\\nIn the 1980s, Thatcherism represented a systematic, decisive rejection and reversal of the Post-war consensus, whereby the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of Keynesianism, the welfare state, nationalised industry, public housing and close regulation of the economy. There was one major exception: the National Health Service, which was widely popular and had wide support inside the Conservative Party. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher promised Britons in 1982, the NHS is \\"safe in our hands.\\"[20]\\r\\nIn the 1980s modern management processes (General Management) were introduced in the NHS to replace the previous system of consensus management. This was outlined in the Griffiths Report of 1983.[21] This recommended the appointment of general managers in the NHS with whom responsibility should lie. The report also recommended that clinicians be better involved in management. Financial pressures continued to place strain on the NHS. In 1987, an additional S101 million was provided by the government to the NHS. In 1988 the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, announced a review of the NHS. From this review and in 1989, two white papers Working for Patients and Caring for People were produced. These outlined the introduction of what was termed the \\"internal market\\", which was to shape the structure and organisation of health services for most of the next decade. In spite of intensive opposition from the BMA, who wanted a pilot study or the reforms in one region, the internal market was introduced.\\r\\nIn 1990, the National Health Service & Community Care Act (in England) defined this \\"internal market\\", whereby Health Authorities ceased to run hospitals but \\"purchased\\" care from their own or other authorities' hospitals. Certain GPs became \\"fund holders\\" and were able to purchase care for their patients. The \\"providers\\" became NHS trusts, which encouraged competition but also increased local differences.\\r\\nThese innovations, especially the \\"fund holder\\" option, were condemned at the time by the Labour Party. Opposition to what was claimed to be the Conservative intention to privatise the NHS became a major feature of Labour's election campaigns.\\r\\nLabour came to power in 1997 with the promise to remove the \\"internal market\\" and abolish fundholding. In a speech given by the new Prime Minister, Tony Blair, at the Lonsdale Medical Centre on 9 December 1997, he stated that:\\r\\nThe White Paper we are publishing today marks a turning point for the NHS. It replaces the internal market with \\"integrated care\\". We will put doctors and nurses in the driving seat. The result will be that S1?billion of unnecessary red tape will be saved and the money put into frontline patient care. For the first time the need to ensure that high quality care is spread throughout the service will be taken seriously. National standards of care will be guaranteed. There will be easier and swifter access to the NHS when you need it. Our approach combines efficiency and quality with a belief in fairness and partnership. Comparing not competing will drive efficiency.\\r\\nHowever, in his second term Blair pursued measures to strengthen the internal market as part of his plan to \\"modernise\\" the NHS.\\r\\nDriving these reforms were a number of factors including the rising costs of medical technology and medicines, the desire to increase standards and \\"patient choice\\", an ageing population, and a desire to contain government expenditure. Since the National Health Services in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are not controlled by the UK government, these reforms have increased the differences between the National Health Services in different parts of the United Kingdom. (See NHS Wales and NHS Scotland for descriptions of their developments).\\r\\nReforms included (amongst other actions) the laying down of detailed service standards, strict financial budgeting, revised job specifications, reintroduction of a modified form of fundholding ÿ \\"practice-based commissioning\\", closure of surplus facilities and emphasis on rigorous clinical and corporate governance. In addition Modernising Medical Careers medical training had an unsuccessful restructuring which was so badly managed that the Secretary of State for Health was forced to apologise publicly. It was then revised but its flawed implementation left the NHS with significant medical staffing problems. Some new services were developed to help manage demand, including NHS Direct. A new emphasis was given to staff reforms, with the Agenda for Change agreement providing harmonised pay and career progression. These changes gave rise to controversy within the medical professions, the media and the public.\\r\\nThe Blair Government, whilst leaving services free at point of use, encouraged outsourcing of medical services and support to the private sector. Under the Private Finance Initiative, an increasing number of hospitals were built (or rebuilt) by private sector consortia; hospitals may have both medical services (such as Independent Sector Treatment Centre (ISTC or \\"surgicentres\\"),[23] and non-medical services (such as catering) provided under long-term contracts by the private sector. A study by a consultancy company which worked for the Department of Health showed that every S200?million spent on privately financed hospitals resulted in the loss of 1000 doctors and nurses. The first PFI hospitals contained some 28 per cent fewer beds than the ones they replaced.[24]\\r\\nIn 2005, surgicentres treated around 3 per cent of NHS patients (in England) having routine surgery. By 2008 this was expected to be around 10 per cent.[25] NHS Primary Care Trusts have been given the target of sourcing at least 15 per cent of primary care from the private or voluntary sectors over the medium term.\\r\\nAs a corollary to these initiatives, the NHS was required to take on pro-active socially \\"directive\\" policies, for example, in respect of smoking and obesity.\\r\\nThe NHS encountered significant problems with the information technology (IT) innovations accompanying the Blair reforms. The NHS's National Programme for IT (NPfIT), believed to be the largest IT project in the world, is running significantly behind schedule and above budget, with friction between the Government and the programme contractors. Originally budgeted at S2.3?billion, present estimates are S20ÿ30?billion and rising.[26] There has also been criticism of a lack of patient information security.[27] The ability to deliver integrated high quality services will require care professionals to use sensitive medical data. This must be controlled and in the NPfIT model it is, sometimes too tightly to allow the best care to be delivered. One concern is that GPs and hospital doctors have given the project a lukewarm reception, citing a lack of consultation and complexity.[28] Key \\"front-end\\" parts of the programme include Choose and Book, intended to assist patient choice of location for treatment, which has missed numerous deadlines for going \\"live\\", substantially overrun its original budget, and is still (May 2006) available in only a few locations. The programme to computerise all NHS patient records is also experiencing great difficulties. Furthermore, there are unresolved financial and managerial issues on training NHS staff to introduce and maintain these systems once they are operative.\\r\\nBetween 2004/5 and 2013/4 NHS output increased considerably. Hospital admissions increased by 32%, outpatient attendances by 17%, primary care consultations by 25% and community care activity by 14%. Hospital death rates reduced, especially in stroke. At the same time there was an increase in wages of 24% and an increase of 10% in the number of staff and increases in the use of equipment and supplies. As a whole NHS output increased by 47% and inputs by 31%, an increase in productivity of 12.86% during the period, or 1.37% per year.[29]\\r\\nThe return of a Conservative-led government in 2010 coincided with another deterioration in industrial relations. The introduction of further private sector involvement in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 provoked mass demonstrations led by health workers, and some NHS workers also participated in a national strike over pay restraint in 2014. 2016 also saw major industrial action by junior doctors, protesting at the imposition of a new contract aiming to extend weekend working.","input":"What was before the nhs and welfare system?"},{"output":"a democratic, federal parliamentary republic","context":"Germany is a democratic, federal parliamentary republic, and federal legislative power is vested in the Bundestag (the parliament of Germany) and the Bundesrat (the representative body of the L?nder, Germany's regional states).\\r\\nThe multi-party system has, since 1949, been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). The judiciary of Germany is independent of the executive and the legislature, while it is common for leading members of the executive to be member of the legislature, as well. The political system is laid out in the 1949 constitution, the Grundgesetz (Basic Law), which remained in effect with minor amendments after German reunification in 1990.\\r\\nThe constitution emphasizes the protection of individual liberty in an extensive catalogue of human and civil rights and divides powers both between the federal and state levels and between the legislative, executive and judicial branches.\\r\\nWest Germany was a founding member of the European Community in 1958, which became the EU in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area, and has been a member of the eurozone since 1999. It is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G8, the G20 and the OECD.\\r\\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Germany as \\"full democracy\\" in 2017.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany had Christian Democratic chancellors for 20 years until a coalition between the Social Democrats and the Liberals took over. From 1982, Christian Democratic leader Helmut Kohl was chancellor in a coalition with the Liberals for 16 years. In this period fell the reunification of Germany, in 1990: the German Democratic Republic joined the Federal Republic. In the former GDR's territory, five L?nder (states) were established or reestablished. The two parts of Berlin united as one \\"Land\\" (state).\\r\\nThe political system of the Federal Republic remained more or less unchanged. Specific provisions for the former GDR territory were enabled via the unification treaty between the Federal Republic and the GDR prior to the unification day of October 3, 1990. However, Germany saw in the following two distinct party systems: the Green party and the Liberals remained mostly West German parties, while in the East the former socialist state party, now called PDS, flourished along with the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats.\\r\\nAfter 16 years of the ChristianÿLiberal coalition, led by Helmut Kohl, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) together with the Greens won the Bundestag elections of 1998. SPD vice chairman Gerhard Schr?der positioned himself as a centrist candidate, in contradiction to the leftist SPD chairman Oskar Lafontaine. The Kohl government was hurt at the polls by slower economic growth in the East in the previous two years, and constantly high unemployment. The final margin of victory was sufficiently high to permit a \\"red-green\\" coalition of the SPD with Alliance '90/The Greens (Bndnis '90/Die Grnen), bringing the Greens into a national government for the first time.\\r\\nInitial problems of the new government, marked by policy disputes between the moderate and traditional left wings of the SPD, resulted in some voter disaffection. Lafontaine left the government (and later his party) in early 1999. The CDU won in some important state elections but was hit in 2000 by a party donation scandal from the Kohl years. As a result of this Christian Democratic Union (CDU) crisis, Angela Merkel became chair.\\r\\nThe next election for the Bundestag was on 22 September 2002. Gerhard Schr?der led the coalition of SPD and Greens to an eleven-seat victory over the Christian Democrat challengers headed by Edmund Stoiber (CSU). Three factors are generally cited that enabled Schr?der to win the elections despite poor approval ratings a few months before and a weaker economy: good handling of the 100-year flood, firm opposition to the US 2003 invasion of Iraq, and Stoiber's unpopularity in the east, which cost the CDU crucial seats there.\\r\\nIn its second term, the redÿgreen coalition lost several very important state elections, for example in Lower Saxony where Schr?der was the prime minister from 1990 to 1998. On 20 April 2003, chancellor Schr?der announced massive labor market reforms, called Agenda 2010, that cut unemployment benefits. Although these reforms sparked massive protests, they are now credited with being in part responsible for the relatively strong economic performance of Germany during the euro-crisis and the decrease in unemployment in Germany in the years 2006/7.[2]\\r\\nOn 22 May 2005 the SPD received a devastating defeat in its former heartland, North Rhine-Westphalia. Half an hour after the election results, the SPD chairman Franz Mntefering announced that the chancellor would clear the way for new federal elections.\\r\\nThis took the republic by surprise, especially because the SPD was below 25% in polls at the time. The CDU quickly announced Angela Merkel as Christian Democrat candidate for chancellor, aspiring to be the first female chancellor in German history.\\r\\nNew for the 2005 election was the alliance between the newly formed Electoral Alternative for Labor and Social Justice (WASG) and the PDS, planning to fuse into a common party (see Left Party.PDS). With the former SPD chairman, Oskar Lafontaine for the WASG and Gregor Gysi for the PDS as prominent figures, this alliance soon found interest in the media and in the population. Polls in July saw them as high as 12%.\\r\\nWhereas in May and June 2005 victory of the Christian Democrats seemed highly likely, with some polls giving them an absolute majority, this picture changed shortly before the election at 18 September 2005.\\r\\nThe election results of 18 September were surprising because they differed widely from the polls of the previous weeks. The Christian Democrats even lost votes compared to 2002, narrowly reaching the first place with only 35.2%, and failed to get a majority for a \\"blackÿyellow\\" government of CDU/CSU and liberal FDP. But the redÿgreen coalition also failed to get a majority, with the SPD losing votes, but polling 34.2% and the greens staying at 8.1%. The Left reached 8.7% and entered the Bundestag, whereas the NPD only got 1.6%.[3]\\r\\nThe most likely outcome of coalition talks was a so-called grand coalition between the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democrats (SPD). Three party coalitions and coalitions involving The Left had been ruled out by all interested parties (including The Left itself). On 22 November 2005, Angela Merkel was sworn in by president Horst K?hler for the office of Bundeskanzlerin.\\r\\nThe existence of the grand coalition on federal level helped smaller parties' electoral prospects in state elections. Since in 2008, the CSU lost its absolute majority in Bavaria and formed a coalition with the FDP, the grand coalition had no majority in the Bundesrat and depended on FDP votes on important issues. In November 2008, the SPD re-elected its already retired chair Franz Mntefering and made Frank-Walter Steinmeier its leading candidate for the federal election in September 2009.\\r\\nAs a result of that federal election, the grand coalition brought losses for both parties and came to an end. The SPD suffered the heaviest losses in its history and was unable to form a coalition government. The CDU/CSU had only little losses but also reached a new historic low with its worst result since 1949. The three smaller parties thus had more seats in the German Bundestag than ever before, with the liberal party FDP winning 14.6% of votes.\\r\\nThe CDU/CSU and FDP together held 332 seats (of 622 total seats) and had been in coalition since 27 October 2009. Angela Merkel was re-elected as chancellor, and Guido Westerwelle served as the foreign minister and vice chancellor of Germany. After being elected into the federal government, the FDP suffered from heavy losses in the following state elections. The FDP had promised to lower taxes in the electoral campaign, but after being part of the coalition they had to concede that this was not possible due to the economic crisis. Because of the losses, Guido Westerwelle had to resign as chair of the FDP in favor of Philipp R?sler, Federal minister of health, who was consequently appointed as vice chancellor. Shortly after, Philipp R?sler changed office and became federal minister of economics and technology.\\r\\nAfter their electoral defeat, the Social Democrats were led by Sigmar Gabriel, a former federal minister and prime minister of Lower Saxony, and by Frank-Walter Steinmeier as the head of the parliamentary group. He resigned on 16 January 2017 and proposed his longtime friend and president of European Parliament Martin Schulz as his successor and chancellor candidate.[4] Germany has seen increased political activity by citizens outside the established political parties with respect to local and environmental issues such as the location of Stuttgart 21, a railway hub, and construction of Berlin-Brandenburg International Airport.[5]\\r\\nThe 18th federal elections in Germany resulted in the re-election of Angela Merkel and her Christian democratic parliamentary group of the parties CDU and CSU, receiving 41.5% of all votes. Following Merkel's first two historically low results, her third campaign marked the CDU/CSU's best result since 1994 and only for the second time in German history the possibility of gaining an absolute majoriy. Their former coalition partner, the FDP, narrowly failed to reach the 5% threshold and did not gain seats in the Bundestag.[6]\\r\\nNot having reached an absolute majority, the CDU/CSU formed a grand coalition with the social-democratic SPD after the longest coalition talks in history, making the head of the party Sigmar Gabriel vice-chancellor and federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy. Together they held 504 of a total 631 seats (CDU/CSU 311 and SPD 193). The only two opposition parties were The Left (64 seats) and Alliance '90/The Greens (63 seats), which was acknowledged as creating a critical situation in which the opposition parties did not even have enough seats to use the special controlling powers of the opposition.[7]\\r\\nThe 19th federal elections in Germany took place on 24 September 2017. The two big parties, the conservative parliamentary group CDU/CSU and the social democrat SPD were in a similar situation as in 2009, after the last grand coalition had ended, and both had suffered severe losses; reaching their second worst and worst result respectively in 2017.\\r\\nMany votes in the 2017 elections went to smaller parties, leading the right-wing populist party AfD (Alternative for Germany) into the Bundestag which marked a big shift in German politics since it was the first far-right party to win seats in parliament since the 1950s.\\r\\nWith Merkel's candidacy for a fourth term, the CDU/CSU only reached 33.0% of the votes, but won the highest number of seats, leaving no realistic coalition option without the CDU/CSU. As all parties in the Bundestag strictly ruled out a coalition with the AfD, the only options for a majority coalition were a so-called \\"Jamaica\\" coalition (CDU/CSU, FDP, Greens; named after the party colors and those of the Jamaican flag) and a grand coalition with the SPD, which was at first opposed by the Social Democrats and their leader Martin Schulz.\\r\\nCoalition talks between the three \\"Jamaica\\" parties were held but the final proposal was rejected by the liberals of the FDP, leaving the government in limbo.[8][9] Following the unprecedented situation, for the first time in German history different minority coalitions or even direct snap coalitions were also heavily discussed. At this point, Federal President Steinmeier invited leaders of all parties for talks about a government, being the first President in the history of the Federal Republic to do so.\\r\\nOfficial coalition talks between CDU/CSU and SPD started in January 2018 and led to a renewal of the grand coalition on 12 March 2018 as well as the subsequent re-election of Angela Merkel as chancellor.[10]\\r\\nThe Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany is the Constitution of Germany.[11] It was formally approved on 8 May 1949, and, with the signature of the Allies of World War II on 12 May, came into effect on 23 May, as the constitution of those states of West Germany that were initially included within the Federal Republic. The 1949 Basic Law is a response to the perceived flaws of the 1919 Weimar Constitution, which failed to prevent the rise of the Nazi party in 1933. Since 1990 in the course of the reunification process after fall of the Berlin Wall the Basic Law also applies to the states of East Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German head of state is the Federal President. As in Germany's parliamentary system of government the Federal Chancellor runs the government and the politics of the day while the role of the Federal President is mostly ceremonial. The Federal President, by his actions and public appearances, represents the state itself, its existence, its legitimacy, and unity. His office involves an integrative role.[12] Nearly all actions of the Federal President become valid only after a countersignature of a government member.\\r\\nThe President is not obliged by Constitution to refrain from political views. He is expected to give direction to general political and societal debates, but not in a way that links him to party politics. Most German Presidents were active politicians and party members prior to the office, which means that they have to change their political style when becoming President. The function comprises the official residence of Bellevue Palace.\\r\\nUnder Article 59 (1) of the Basic Law, the Federal President represents the Federal Republic of Germany in matters of international law, concludes treaties with foreign states on its behalf and accredits diplomats.[13]\\r\\nAll federal laws must be signed by the President before they can come into effect; he does not have a veto, but the conditions for refusing to sign a law on the basis of unconstitutionality are the subject of debate.[14] The office is currently held by Frank-Walter Steinmeier (since 2017).\\r\\nThe Federal President does have a role in the political system, especially at the establishment of a new government and the dissolution of the Bundestag (parliament). This role is usually nominal but can become significant in case of political instability. Additionally, a Federal President together with the Federal Council can support the government in a \\"legislatory emergency state\\" to enable laws against the will of the Bundestag (Article 81 of the Basic Law). However, until now the Federal President has never had to use these \\"reserve powers.\\"\\r\\nThe Bundeskanzler (federal chancellor) heads the Bundesregierung (federal government) and thus the executive branch of the federal government. He or she is elected by and responsible to the Bundestag, Germany's parliament. The other members of the government are the Federal Ministers; they are chosen by the Chancellor. Germany, like the United Kingdom, can thus be classified as a parliamentary system. The office is currently held by Angela Merkel (since 2005).\\r\\nThe Chancellor cannot be removed from office during a four-year term unless the Bundestag has agreed on a successor. This constructive vote of no confidence is intended to avoid the situation of the Weimar Republic in which the executive did not have enough support in the legislature to govern effectively, but the legislature was too divided to name a successor. The current system also prevents the Chancellor from calling a snap election.\\r\\nExcept in the periods 1969ÿ72 and 1976ÿ82, when the Social Democratic party of Chancellor Brandt and Schmidt came in second in the elections, the chancellor has always been the candidate of the largest party, usually supported by a coalition of two parties with a majority in the parliament. The chancellor appoints one of the federal ministers as their deputy,[15] who has the unofficial title Vice Chancellor (German: Vizekanzler). The office is currently held by Olaf Scholz (since March 2018).\\r\\nThe German Cabinet (Bundeskabinett or Bundesregierung) is the chief executive body of the federal republic of Germany. It consists of the chancellor and the cabinet ministers. The fundamentals of the cabinet's organization are set down in articles 62ÿ69 of the Basic Law. The current cabinet is Merkel IV (since 2018).\\r\\nFederal legislative power is divided between the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. The Bundestag is directly elected by the German people, while the Bundesrat represents the governments of the regional states (L?nder). The federal legislature has powers of exclusive jurisdiction and concurrent jurisdiction with the states in areas specified in the constitution.\\r\\nThe Bundestag is more powerful than the Bundesrat and only needs the latter's consent for proposed legislation related to revenue shared by the federal and state governments, and the imposition of responsibilities on the states. In practice, however, the agreement of the Bundesrat in the legislative process is often required, since federal legislation frequently has to be executed by state or local agencies. In the event of disagreement between the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, a conciliation committee is formed to find a compromise.\\r\\nThe Bundestag (Federal Diet) is elected for a four-year term and consists of 598 or more members elected by a means of mixed-member proportional representation, which Germans call \\"personalised proportional representation.\\" 299 members represent single-seat constituencies and are elected by a first past the post electoral system. Parties that obtain fewer constituency seats than their national share of the vote are allotted seats from party lists to make up the difference. In contrast, parties that obtain more constituency seats than their national share of the vote are allowed to keep these so-called overhang seats. In the parliament that was elected in 2009, there were 24 overhang seats, giving the Bundestag a total of 622 members. After Bundestag elections since 2013, other parties obtain extra seats (\\"balance seats\\") that offset advantages from their rival's overhang seats. The current Bundestag is the largest in German history with 709 parliament members.\\r\\nA party must receive either five percent of the national vote or win at least three directly elected seats to be eligible for non-constituency seats in the Bundestag. This rule, often called the \\"five percent hurdle\\", was incorporated into Germany's election law to prevent political fragmentation and strong minor parties. The first Bundestag elections were held in the Federal Republic of Germany (\\"West Germany\\") on 14 August 1949. Following reunification, elections for the first all-German Bundestag were held on 2 December 1990. The last federal election was held on 24 September 2017.\\r\\nGermany follows the civil law tradition. The judicial system comprises three types of courts.\\r\\nThe main difference between the Federal Constitutional Court and the Federal Court of Justice is that the Federal Constitutional Court may only be called if a constitutional matter within a case is in question (e.g. a possible violation of human rights in a criminal trial), while the Federal Court of Justice may be called in any case.\\r\\nGermany maintains a network of 229 diplomatic missions abroad and holds relations with more than 190 countries.[16] It is the largest contributor to the budget of the European Union (providing 27%) and third largest contributor to the United Nations (providing 8%). Germany is a member of the NATO defence alliance, the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the G8, the G20, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund(IMF).\\r\\nGermany has played a leading role in the European Union since its inception and has maintained a strong alliance with France since the end of World War II. The alliance was especially close in the late 1980s and early 1990s under the leadership of Christian Democrat Helmut Kohl and Socialist Fran?ois Mitterrand. Germany is at the forefront of European states seeking to advance the creation of a more unified European political, defence, and security apparatus.[17] For a number of decades after WWII, the Federal Republic of Germany kept a notably low profile in international relations, because of both its recent history and its occupation by foreign powers.[18]\\r\\nDuring the Cold War, Germany's partition by the Iron Curtain made it a symbol of EastÿWest tensions and a political battleground in Europe. However, Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik was a key factor in the dtente of the 1970s.[19] In 1999, Chancellor Gerhard Schr?der's government defined a new basis for German foreign policy by taking a full part in the decisions surrounding the NATO war against Yugoslavia and by sending German troops into combat for the first time since World War II.[20]\\r\\nThe governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies.[21] The 1948 Marshall Plan and strong cultural ties have crafted a strong bond between the two countries, although Schr?der's very vocal opposition to the Iraq War suggested the end of Atlanticism and a relative cooling of GermanÿAmerican relations.[22] The two countries are also economically interdependent: 8.8% of German exports are US-bound and 6.6% of German imports originate from the US.[23] Other signs of the close ties include the continuing position of GermanÿAmericans as the largest reported ethnic group in the US,[24] and the status of Ramstein Air Base (near Kaiserslautern) as the largest US military community outside the US.[25]\\r\\nThe policy on foreign aid is an important area of German foreign policy. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and carried out by the implementing organisations. The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community.[26] It is the world's fourth biggest aid donor after the United States, the United Kingdom and France.[27] Germany spent 0.37 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on development, which is below the government's target of increasing aid to 0.51 per cent of GDP by 2010.\\r\\nGermany comprises sixteen states that are collectively referred to as L?nder.[28] Due to differences in size and population, the subdivision of these states varies especially between city-states (Stadtstaaten) and states with larger territories (Fl?chenl?nder). For regional administrative purposes five states, namely Baden-Wrttemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony, consist of a total of 22 Government Districts (Regierungsbezirke). As of 2009 Germany is divided into 403 districts (Kreise) on municipal level, these consist of 301 rural districts and 102 urban districts.[29]","input":"What kind of government does germany have today?"},{"output":"24 ribs (12 pairs)","context":"In vertebrate anatomy, ribs (Latin: costae) are the long curved bones which form the rib cage. In most tetrapods, ribs surround the chest, enabling the lungs to expand and thus facilitate breathing by expanding the chest cavity. They serve to protect the lungs, heart, and other internal organs of the thorax. In some animals, especially snakes, ribs may provide support and protection for the entire body.\\r\\n\\r\\nHumans have 24 ribs (12 pairs). The first seven sets of ribs, known as \\"true ribs\\" (costae verae) also known as vertebrosternal ribs, are directly attached to the sternum through the costal cartilage. Rib 1 is unique and harder to distinguish than other ribs.  It is a short, flat, C-shaped bone.  The vertebral attachment can be found just below the neck at the first thoracic vertebra, and the majority of this bone can be found above the level of the clavicle.  Ribs 2 through 7 have a more traditional appearance and become longer and less curved as they progress downwards.[1]  The following five sets are known as \\"false ribs\\" (costae spuriae), three of these sharing a common cartilaginous connection to the sternum, while the last two (eleventh and twelfth ribs) are termed floating ribs (costae fluctuantes) or vertebral ribs. They are attached to the vertebrae only, and not to the sternum or cartilage coming off of the sternum. Some people lack one of the two pairs of floating ribs, while others have a third pair.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, human ribs increase in length from ribs 1 through 7 and decrease in length again through rib 12.  Along with this change in size, the ribs become progressively oblique (slanted) from ribs 1 through 9, then less slanted through rib 12.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ribcage is separated from the lower abdomen by the thoracic diaphragm which controls breathing. When the diaphragm contracts, the thoracic cavity is expanded, reducing intra-thoracic pressure and drawing air into the lungs. This happens through one of two actions (or a mix of the two): when the lower ribs the diaphragm connects to are stabilized by muscles and the central tendon is mobile, when the muscle contracts the central tendon is drawn down, compressing the cavity underneath and expanding the thoracic cavity downward. When the central tendon is stabilized and the lower ribs are mobile, a contraction of the diaphragm elevates the ribs, which works in conjunction with other muscles to expand the thoracic indent upward.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fish, there are often two sets of ribs attached to the vertebral column. One set, the dorsal ribs, are found in the dividing septum between the upper and lower parts of the main muscle segments, projecting roughly sideways from the vertebral column. The second set, the ventral ribs arise from the vertebral column just below the dorsal ribs, and enclose the lower body, often joining at the tips. Not all species possess both types of rib, with the dorsal ribs being most commonly absent. Sharks, for example, have no dorsal ribs, and only very short ventral ribs, while lampreys have no ribs at all. In some teleosts, there may be additional rib-like bones within the muscle mass.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nTetrapods, however, only ever have a single set of ribs which are probably homologous with the dorsal ribs of fishes. In the early tetrapods, every vertebra bore a pair of ribs, although those on the thoracic vertebrae are typically the longest. The sacral ribs were stout and short, since they formed part of the pelvis, connecting the backbone to the hip bones.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most subsequent forms, many of these early ribs have been lost, and in living amphibians and reptiles, there is great variation in rib structure and number. For example, turtles have only eight pairs of ribs, which are developed into a bony or cartilagenous carapace and plastron, while snakes have numerous ribs running along the full length of their trunk. Frogs typically have no ribs, aside from a sacral pair, which form part of the pelvis.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn birds, ribs are present as distinct bones only on the thoracic region, although small fused ribs are present on the cervical vertebrae.  The thoracic ribs of birds possess a wide projection to the rear; this uncinate process is an attachment for the shoulder muscles.[2] \\r\\nUsually dogs have 26 ribs.\\r\\nMammals usually also only have distinct ribs on the thoracic vertebra, although fixed cervical ribs are also present in monotremes. In marsupials and placental mammals, the cervical and lumbar ribs are found only as tiny remnants fused to the vertebrae, where they are referred to as transverse processes. In general, the structure and number of the true ribs in humans is similar to that in other mammals. Unlike reptiles, caudal ribs are never found in mammals.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman ribs (shown in red).

The Benz Velo, as the first production car, is an exception.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nComparing claimed speeds of the fastest production cars in the world, especially in historical cases, is difficult as there is no standardized method for determining the top speed and no central authority to verify any such claims. Examples of the difficulties faced were shown up in the dispute between Bugatti and Hennessey over which car was the world's fastest.[1]\\r\\nThe Koenigsegg CCR recorded a top speed of 387.866 km/h at the Nardo testing facility on 28 February 2005. This speed eclipsed the previous record of 355 km/h held by the McLaren F1. The record was supervised and accredited by Guinness World Records at the time and a certificate recognising this achievement was awarded. The certificate cites the CCR as \\"The fastest production car... which achieved a speed of 387.866 km/h over a measured kilometre at the Nardo Prototipo proving ground, Italy\\"\\r\\nThe CCR and it's predecessor, the identical-but-lesser-powered CC8S were produced in a total of 21 units (15 CCR, 6 CC8S). Although it was recognised by Guinness as the world's fastest production car at the time of the record, a total production run under 25 units does not qualify the CCR for inclusion on the table below.\\r\\nThe current Guinness World Records title holder, the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, was certified for the average top speed achieved on a two-way run, registering 431.072?km/h (267.856?mph). Bugatti made 5 Veyrons named the World Record Edition out of the initial production run of 30 Super Sports, all of which would be able to achieve this speed if the limiter was removed. With the limiter the Veyron SS goes 415?km/h (257.87?mph). Bugatti did not sell any with the limiter removed. Initially, when challenged by Hennessey, Guinness decided the Bugatti was ineligible because the test car was deemed as being modified. Bugatti sought a review of the decision and Guinness, after a review by a panel of experts, considered removing the limiter was not a modification and thereby making the car eligible for their publication.[2] To this day, even though the Bugatti Chiron is believed to have a top speed of around 463?km/h (288?mph), it is not verified, and with the limiter it has a non-verified top speed of 261?mph (420?km/h). As of August 2017[update], the Veyron SS is still classified as the fastest production car in the world.\\r\\nIn 2014, a Hennessey Venom GT was recorded at 435.31?km/h (270.49?mph), but as the run was in one direction only and only 12 cars (+1 prototype) were ever made, it does not qualify under the Guinness Book of Records or this list's criteria as the world's fastest production car.[3] Guinness accepted it as production car, however.[4][5]\\r\\nBecause of the inconsistencies with the various definitions of production cars, dubious claims by manufacturers and self-interest groups, and inconsistent or changing application of the definitions this list has a defined set of requirements. For further explanation of how these were arrived at see the above link.\\r\\nThis list is also limited to post World War II production road cars which reached more than 124?mph (200?km/h), older cars are excluded even if they were faster.

The adaptation was first transmitted in the UK between 1975 and 1977.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe romantic saga follows Ross Poldark (Robin Ellis) as he loses his fiance, the well-bred beauty, Elizabeth (Jill Townsend), to his cousin Francis (Clive Francis). Ross ends up marrying his servant, the unlikely-looking Demelza (Angharad Rees), but his passion for Elizabeth simmers on for years. Set in late 18th century Cornwall, the plot follows Ross Poldark's attempts to make his derelict tin mines a success. Life is hard, smuggling is rife and Ross Poldark finds himself taking the side of the underclass against the ruthless behaviour of his enemies, the greedy Warleggan clan including George Warleggan (Ralph Bates).\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the emphasis is primarily on Ross and Demelza, there are many other characters with their own stories. In the first series we encounter Dr. Dwight Enys (Richard Morant in the first series, Michael Cadman in the second series), a young man with progressive ideas who prefers to serve the poor communities rather than the rich. Enys has a brief affair with a married actress, Keren Daniel (Sheila White), which results in her murder by her husband.\\r\\nBy the end of the first series, Dwight has become involved with heiress Caroline Penvenen (Judy Geeson). In the second series, they marry following Ross's rescue of Dwight from a French prison.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second series we get to see much of Geoffrey Charles Poldark (Stefan Gates), the son of Elizabeth and Francis Poldark. Francis drowns in a subterranean lake while investigating a putative new lode of copper in a mine in which he is invested with Ross. Elizabeth eventually marries Ross's great enemy George Warleggan. Geoffrey Charles resembles his father, and at times comes into conflict with his new stepfather George Warleggan, though Warleggan shows him certain kindnesses and pays for his education. Geoffrey Charles begins a friendship with Demelza's brother Drake Carne (Kevin McNally), whom he and his governess, Elizabeth's cousin Morwenna (Jane Wymark), meet in the woods on the Warleggan estate. Geoffrey Charles plays an instrumental role in the development of Drake and Morwenna's romance.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrake is Ross Poldark's brother-in-law and has a working-class background: therefore George considers him an unsuitable marriage partner for Morwenna. George marries Morwenna off to Reverend Osborne Whitworth (Christopher Biggins), whom she despises. Pining for Morwenna, Drake puts his energies into building his blacksmith business and helping his brother Sam (David Delve), a devout Methodist.\\r\\n\\r\\nMorwenna and Osborne have a son, John Conan, whom Morwenna cannot bring herself to love. Eventually Morwenna tells Osborne she will kill his son if he forces his attentions on her one more time. Osborne has an affair with Morwenna's younger sister Rowella (Julie Dawn Cole). Rowella's husband Arthur Solway (Stephen Reynolds) discovers his wife's adultery and attacks Osborne, who is dragged to death by his frightened horse. Despite being traumatized by her marriage to Osborne, Morwenna eventually marries Drake.\\r\\n\\r\\nSam becomes enamoured of Emma Tregirls (Trudie Styler), who refuses to marry him because she knows that his Methodist congregation will never approve of her. She loves Sam, but knows that her lack of religion and her bad reputation will eventually cause conflict between him and his faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the emphasis remains with Ross and Demelza, and the series concludes with the death of Elizabeth Warleggan after the birth of her and George's daughter Ursula. Elizabeth takes a potion to bring on labour early so Warleggan will be led to think that she habitually delivers her children a few weeks pre-term; Elizabeth had delivered Valentine, born eight months after her wedding to George, after she took a supposed accidental fall on the stairs, which, it is implied only, was intentional on her part because she felt the labour coming on. Valentine is Ross's son, conceived a month before Elizabeth and George's wedding, but George is long deceived as to Valentine's parentage. Agatha Poldark (Eileen Way) and Prudie Paynter (Mary Wimbush), Ross and Demelza's housekeeper, both realize that Valentine is Ross's son, and Agatha tells George of her conclusion just before her death, which occurs under George's abuse of her in his anger over her revelation. Elizabeth dies of gangrene due to the potion. When the doctor asks her if she has taken anything to bring on the labour, she denies it because Warleggan is sitting beside her. George later reveals his knowledge of what Elizabeth has done when he says to Ross, \\"This is what we have brought her to.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BBC adaptation of the first four books of the Poldark novels was broadcast by the BBC during 1975 and 1976.[1] This included eight weeks' location filming in Cornwall.[1] The second series was broadcast in the UK in the autumn of 1977, from the next three books.

This article outlines the early history of the industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nMusic publishing did not begin on a large scale until the mid-15th century, when mechanical techniques for printing music were first developed. The earliest example, a set of liturgical chants, dates from about 1465, shortly after the Gutenberg Bible. Prior to this time, music had to be copied out by hand. This was a very labor-intensive and time-consuming process, so it was usually undertaken only by monks and priests seeking to preserve sacred music for the church. The few collections of secular music that are extant were commissioned and owned by wealthy noblemen. Examples include the Squarcialupi Codex of Italian Trecento music and the Chantilly Codex of French Ars subtilior music.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father of modern music printing was Ottaviano Petrucci, a printer and publisher who was able to secure a twenty-year monopoly on printed music in Venice during the 16th century. His first collection was entitled Harmonice Musices Odhecaton and contained 96 polyphonic compositions, mostly by Josquin des Prez and Heinrich Isaac. He flourished by focusing on Flemish works, rather than Italian, as they were very popular throughout Europe during the Renaissance. His printing shop used the triple-impression method, in which a sheet of paper was pressed three times. The first impression was the staff lines, the second the words, and the third the notes. This method produced very clean results, though it was time-consuming and expensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround 1520 in England, John Rastell developed a single-impression method for printing music.[1] With his method, the staff lines, words and notes were all part of a single piece of type, making it much easier to produce. However, this method produced messier results, as the staff lines were often inexactly aligned and looked wavy on the page. The single-impression method eventually triumphed over Petrucci's, however, and became the dominant mode of printing until copper-plate engraving took over in the 17th century. This method was adopted and used widely by a Frenchman, Pierre Attaingnant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of musical copyright had its beginnings in the reign of King Henry VIII of England who required copies of all printed matter to be sent to him and offered protection to printers in the form of licenses, primarily to produce a new source of revenue. In 1575 Elizabeth I granted Thomas Tallis and his pupil William Byrd a 21-year patent monopoly on the printing and publishing of polyphonic music.[2] The first modern copyright law was the Statute of Anne (1709), which protected all published works for a period of fourteen years, later extended to twenty-eight years. The earliest attempt at a printed musical copyright notice appears in the \\"Shir Hashirim\\" of Salomone Rossi (Venice, 1623) which includes a rabbinical curse on those infringing the text, written by Leon of Modena.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first international agreement involving copyright was the Berne Convention of 1886. The core principle of the Convention is its provision that each of the contracting countries shall provide automatic protection for works in all other countries of the union and for unpublished works whose authors are citizens of or residents in those countries. Performance rights are included in these provisions.  As of March 2012, 165 countries had become parties to the convention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first U.S. federal copyright law gave protections to \\"maps, charts, and books.\\" Contrary to some scholarly accounts, the 1790 Act's protection of \\"books\\" did encompass musical compositions.[3] The first registration in the U.S. for a musical composition was made on January 6, 1794 by Raynor Taylor for the original song \\"The Kentucky Volunteer.\\"[4] However, musical compositions were not explicitly protected until the Copyright Act of 1831, and then protection remained limited to reproduction rights. The copyright term was twenty-eight years plus a fourteen-year renewal period.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile England was a leader in the development of copyright, the French led the way in performing rights. In 1777, Pierre de Beaumarchais founded the \\"Bureau de Legislation Dramatique\\" which became the present Socit des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques (SACD) in 1829. Many years later, in 1847, this inspired the composer and librettist Ernest Bourget  to claim payment for each performance of his works at Les Ambassadeurs, a leading Caf-concert venue of that time. A lawsuit won by Bourget and others in 1851 led to the formation of the Socit des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique (SACEM) ÿ the first performing rights society in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther countries followed suit: The Italian Societ Italiana degli Autori ed Editori (SIAE) was founded in 1882 and the Spanish \\"Sociedad de Autores\\", predecessor of the current Sociedad General de Autores y Editores (SGAE), in 1899. The predecessor to the Gesellschaft fr Musikalische Auffhrungs und Mechanische Vervielf?ltigungsrechte (GEMA) was formed in Germany by composer Richard Strauss in 1903. It became GEMA in 1915 when it merged with another small society. So, by the end of the 19th century, the foundation had been laid for the modern music publishing industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs England was a leader in developing copyright systems and France was ahead in developing performing rights, Germany was the pioneering country in modern music publishing. The first German music publishing enterprises date from the 18th century. Bernhard Christoph Breitkopf of Leipzig, a printer and general publisher, decided to specialize in music printing as of 1754.  He became successful by developing improvements in the setting of music type. Gottfried Christoph H?rtel joined the firm in 1795, which soon became the partnership of Breitkopf & H?rtel. They were the original publishers for a who's-who of great German composers, including Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, Schumann and Wagner.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchott Music of Mainz was founded in 1770 by Bernhard Schott and still exists today.  They specialized in French and Italian operas and, more recently, have published works by Hindemith, Stravinsky, Orff, Schoenberg and Henze. N. Simrock of Bonn, and later Berlin, was established in 1790 by Nikolaus Simrock.  Their original publications included works by Beethoven, Haydn, Meyerbeer, Weber, Mendelssohn, Schumann and Brahms.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1764, Josiah Flagg compiled the first collection of popular and religious music, printed on paper made in the colonies.  The post-revolutionary period was notable for the arrival of the first professional music publishers from Europe in the 1770s. They opened shops in Philadelphia, New York, Boston and Baltimore, bringing with them European technology. Benjamin Carr and James Hewitt were two important early American music publishers. The first song published under US copyright was The Kentucky Volunteer, by Carr's own house.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first quarter of the 19th century alone, 10,000 pieces of popular music were printed by U.S. publishers. The industry, however, did nothing to promote music or develop writers. Songs became popular by word-of-mouth. Most minstrel troupes and professional singers wrote their own music or had songs written to order. Stephen Foster was the first composer who tried to make a living as an independent professional songwriter but, in the 1850s, copyright protection was so lax and royalties so small (or non-existent) that he found himself living in poverty. This changed only gradually as young men involved in other business enterprises began to perceive the possibilities for enrichment in song publishing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the 1880s, popular music publishing was a secondary function of music stores or \\"serious\\" (Classical) music publishers. After 1880, publishers in New York developed a promotional technique called plugging.  By 1900, most music publishers had clustered their businesses along 28th St. (between 6th Ave. and Broadway) in order to be closer to New York's thriving entertainment center. This area came to be known as Tin Pan Alley. The first decade of the 20th century saw the production of more popular music than had ever been written up to that time: about 25,000 songs annually. In 1893, sheet music for the song \\"After the Ball\\" sold one million copies and, over the next ten years, went on to sell a total of ten million.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the enactment of new U.S. copyright legislation, including the 1891 Chace Act, which allowed for the international protection of copyrights, the provisions of the 1909 Copyright Act were generally ignored. To correct this situation, operetta composer Victor Herbert established the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), in 1914. It quickly attracted prominent composers such as Irving Berlin and John Philip Sousa, and was able to ensure that everyone was properly paid and credited for their work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many aspects to music publishing. Chief among them is the licensing of music for use in advertising, television, films and other purposes. Music publishing started out by just being the publishing of the actual sheet music, and not even the score. Song sheets were made which just had the lyrics of a popular song. In the 19th century, sheet music for songs began including a simple piano accompaniment and notation for the song's melody. In the 2010s, music publishing is the exploitation of compositions (songs, instrumental pieces, and other music) for various performance uses, including newer uses such as licensing for video games, for use by recording artists looking for their next hit single and for use in a range of licensing purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin music publishing there are many different types of licenses. For instance:\\r\\n\\r\\n? Blanket license\\r\\n\\r\\n? Mechanical license\\r\\n\\r\\n? Performing Rights License (PRO)\\r\\n\\r\\n? Synchronization License or Sync Rights\\r\\n\\r\\nA blanket license is a big annual fee to one of the key performing rights organizations (PRO) (SESAC, ASCAP, or BMI). The blanket license paid to the PRO, covers every work that is in the PRO's catalog. Blanket licenses are mostly used by television networks and radio stations so that they have the right to play any song or piece from one catalog instead of paying license fees for every single song.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nA mechanical license is issued when a recording artist wishes to sell their recording of a written composition.  It serves as a notice to the composition owners that sales are forthcoming and that royalties dictated by a statutory rate will be owed and paid to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerforming Rights License (PRO) is the license that gives the licensee the right to publicly perform the song/work that they get the license to anywhere.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, a sync license grants the right to use the composition in the synchronization of a recording over a moving picture in a film, advertisement, television show or any other audiovisual work.  For the same synchronization use, one must also obtain a master use license, which grants rights to use the sound recording, which is a separately owned asset from the composition.\\r\\n\\r\\nA music publisher does a lot to negotiate the uses and fees for the songwriters and composers on their roster. In the 2010s, the publishing companies are a main source of revenue besides live touring, because sync licensing has persisted as a substantial income source while the music industry underwent wrenching changes that saw their previously dominant income source, record sales, steadily decline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe invention and development of sound recording resulted in a redefinition of the concept of publishing, much the same as online music stores in the 2000s would later revolutionize how recordings are purchased. Initially, popular music was slow to take advantage of the new technology. In 1910, when sales of the new disc format exceeded those of the old cylinder, more than 75% of the records sold were classical music. One factor in this may have been the expense, which would have concentrated sales among the more upscale purchasers. Until 1925, sheet music sales continued to surpass discs and were the primary source of revenue for publishers and composers. At that point, sheet music sales began to decline while records were still providing inadequate income to compensate. This led to short lived but serious economic problems for some publishers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSamuel Fox (1884-1971) who founded the Sam Fox Publishing Company in 1906, was the first to publish original film scores.[6] In 1927, after the release of The Jazz Singer (the first talkie), the need for music led movie studios to buy music publishing companies, gaining both catalogues of music and experienced composers at the same time. For example, in 1929, Warner Brothers paid 10 million dollars for Harms, Witmark and Remick; MGM bought Leo Feist Inc. and some smaller companies; Paramount started its own publishing division, Famous Music.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Music Library of Jean-Baptiste Christophe Ballard, Sole Music Printer to the King of France, 1750 Inventory of his Grand Collection Brought to Light by Tula Giannini. link to full article: http://mysite.pratt.edu/~giannini/ballard.htm","input":"Who was the first person to master the art of printing polyphonic music?"},{"output":"Based on the Algiers Motel incident during Detroit's 1967 12th Street Riot","context":"Detroit is a 2017 American period crime drama film directed by Kathryn Bigelow and written by Mark Boal. Based on the Algiers Motel incident during Detroit's 1967 12th Street Riot, the film's release commemorated the 50th anniversary of the event.[5] The film stars John Boyega, Will Poulter, Algee Smith, Jason Mitchell, John Krasinski and Anthony Mackie.\\r\\nDetroit premiered at the Fox Theatre in the titular city on July 25, 2017, and began a limited theatrical release on July 28, 2017, before opening wide on August 4, 2017.[6] The film received positive reviews from critics, with particular praise towards Bigelow's direction, Boal's script and the performances of Poulter and Smith[7][8] but was a box office failure, only earning back $21.1 million against its $34 million budget.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 23, 1967, the Detroit police stage a raid on an unlicensed club during a celebration for returning black veterans. While suspects are being arrested, a mob forms and starts throwing rocks at the officers before looting nearby stores and starting fires, beginning the 12th Street Riot. With civil authorities, elected representatives, and even emergency services unable to maintain any semblance of order, Governor George W. Romney authorizes the Michigan National Guard and Army paratroopers to enter Detroit in order to provide assistance. On the second day of rioting, two cops pursue a fleeing looter. One of them, Philip Krauss, mortally wounds the man with a shotgun against orders, but is allowed to remain on active duty until his superiors can decide whether to file murder charges.\\r\\nThe Dramatics, a professional black R&B group, arrive in Detroit hoping to score a recording contract. Seconds before their scheduled performance at a music hall, the police shut down the venue and order them to leave the city. En route, their bus is attacked by rioters and the group subsequently splits up, with lead singer Larry Reed and his friend Fred Temple renting a room at the local Algiers Motel for the night. They meet two white girls, Julie Ann and Karen, who introduce them to their friends Carl Cooper and Aubrey Pollard. Carl and another friend stage a prank using a starter pistol, upsetting Julie and Karen, who move to the room of Greene, a Vietnam War veteran, while Larry and Fred return to their own room.\\r\\nMelvin Dismukes, a private security guard, is assigned to protect a grocery store from looters and ingratiates himself with the Guardsmen. Carl decides to fire several blanks from his pistol in the direction of the troops to frighten them, but they mistake it for a sniper attack and open fire on the Algiers. A detachment of police arrive, led by Krauss, who guns down Carl when he tries to escape and plants a knife next to his body as he bleeds out and dies.\\r\\nAccompanied by Dismukes and some Guardsmen, the police round up everyone in the hotel and line them against the wall, demanding to know who the shooter was. Despite Dismukes failing to find any weapon during a search of the room, Krauss orders several suspects to be moved to different rooms and subjected to mock executions as part of a \\"game\\" to terrify the others into confessing. Unwilling to get involved, most of the Guardsmen and soldiers leave without informing anyone of Krauss's abuse.\\r\\nJulie and Karen are taken to an upstairs room when they begin screaming, and Julie's clothes are torn off. Disgusted, Dismukes and a Guardsman manage to get them released from custody. Aubrey is killed during his interrogation by one of the remaining Guardsman, and Krauss, fearing arrest, permits the remaining suspects to leave, but only if they swear to keep silent. Greene and Larry agree, but Fred is killed when he refuses.\\r\\nAs the riots die down, Dismukes, while working his other job in a factory, is arrested and charged with murder after Julie identifies him as being present at the Algiers that night. Krauss and his fellow officers are questioned as well, and when everyone except Krauss confesses, they are also charged. Larry, whose singing career has stalled due to the trauma he experienced, is summoned as a witness to testify. The judge ultimately refuses to accept any of the confessions as evidence, and without a solid case, the all-white jury acquits Dismukes, Krauss, and their co-defendents of all charges. Dismukes confronts Krauss with the truth, but finds himself powerless to get any justice for the victims.\\r\\nThe film ends by explaining what became of the participants: Dismukes moved to the suburbs to escape death threats and resumed work as a security guard, Krauss and his men remained on the force but never returned to active duty, Julie rebuilt her life and started a family, and Larry became a choir singer and still lives in Detroit to the present day.\\r\\nOn January 28, 2016, it was announced that Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal would reteam to make a film about the 1967 Detroit riots, with Bigelow directing from a script by Boal.[11] Both would also produce the film, along with Annapurna Pictures' Megan Ellison and Matthew Budman.[11] Game of Thrones actress Hannah Murray was cast in a \\"key role\\" in the film, although her character was then being kept under wraps.[12] The film was scheduled to shoot in the summer of 2016, in order to be released in 2017 for the 50th anniversary of the riots. On June 21, 2016, John Boyega joined the cast.[13] On August 3, 2016, Jack Reynor, Will Poulter, and Ben O'Toole were cast in lead roles.[14] On August 4, 2016, Anthony Mackie joined the cast,[15] and on August 5, 2016, Jacob Latimore and Algee Smith also joined.[16] On August 8, 2016, Joseph David-Jones joined the cast,[17] followed by Kaitlyn Dever on August 30, 2016.[18] On September 9, 2016, Jason Mitchell joined the cast,[19] and on September 13, 2016, John Krasinski was also added.[20] In October 2016, Jeremy Strong, Chris Chalk, Austin Hbert, Ephraim Sykes, Laz Alonso, Nathan Davis Jr., Malcolm David Kelley, Peyton Alex Smith, and Leon Thomas III all joined the cast of the film.[21]\\r\\nIt was reported at the end of July 2016 that the film had commenced principal photography in Boston during the previous week.[22][23] Scenes were filmed inside Dedham District Court,[24] in Dorchester, Massachusetts and in Brockton, Massachusetts.[25] In addition, the movie filmed in Detroit during October 2016. The elimination of Michigan's film incentives in 2015 affected the filming locations.[5][26]\\r\\nIn May 2017, James Newton Howard was hired as the film's composer.[27] In July 2017, Detroit rapper Tee Grizzley released a song called \\"Teetroit\\" for the soundtrack.[28].

It then made $2.6 million on its first day, lowering weekend projections to $7.5 million.[34] It went on to open to $7.1 million, finishing 8th at the box office; 40% of its opening weekend audience was African American. Deadline.com said that the film could have done better had it been released in the fall during festivals and awards season.[35] In its second weekend the film grossed $2.9 million, dropping 59.5% (above average for an adult drama) and finishing in 13th.[36] In its third week of wide release the film was pulled from 1,579 theaters and grossed $850,000 (a drop of 70.9%).[37]\\r\\nDetroit received praise for its direction, script and performances, especially those of Poulter and Smith.[7][8] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 82% based on 216 reviews, and an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Detroit delivers a gut-wrenching ÿ and essential ÿ dramatisation of a tragic chapter from America's past that draws distressing parallels to the present.\\"[38] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[39] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A?\\" on an A+ to F scale.[34]\\r\\nRichard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 4 out of 4 stars and called it one of 2017's best, saying: \\"Journalist-screenwriter Mark Boal (Bigelow's collaborator on The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty) does a magnificent job of juggling the multiple storylines and creating fully authentic characterssome flawed, some basically decent, some evil.\\"[40] Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers praised the cast and script, giving the film 3.5/4 stars and saying, \\"... Detroit is far more than a liberal howl against the escalating toxicity of racism in America. Bigelow, with the same immersive intensity that Christopher Nolan brings to Dunkirk, smacks us down in the middle of a brutal historical event so we can see it ÿ and feel it ÿ for ourselves.\\"[41]\\r\\nConversely, Alexander Nazaryan of Newsweek said, \\"[Bigelow's] characters never come alive, moving through the film less as people than entries in a sociology textbook ... If Bigelow could get inside the minds of soldiers suffocated by post-traumatic stress disorder, as she did so capably in The Hurt Locker, she can get into the mind of anyone. In Zero Dark Thirty, she made even CIA interrogators likeable. The characters in Detroit, though, black and white, are as flat as the plains of the Upper Midwest.\\"[42]\\r\\nSeveral critics noted the film's questionable take on a predominantly African American-based story. A. O. Scott in The New York Times wrote, \\"It is curious that a movie set against a backdrop of black resistance and rebellionhowever inchoate and self-destructive its expression may have beenshould become a tale of black helplessness and passivity. The white men, the decent ones as much as the brutes, have the answers, the power, the agency.\\"[43] K. Austin Collins of The Ringer wrote, \\"This movie isn't really about black people as people, nor history as a lived experience, but is instead invested in a dutiful, 'just the facts, ma'am' reenactment that pretends those other things are already a given. Boal, and Bigelow beside him, refuse to speculate about??or imagine??the rest.\\"[44]\\r\\nThe New Yorker's Richard Brody called the film \\"a moral failure\\", saying: \\"[Bigelow's] intentions come through clearly: to depict an incidentand a climateof racism, to show that the cruelty of these deeds was multiplied by their ultimate impunity, and to suggest that, in the intervening half-century since the events depicted in the film took place, little has changed. Movies arent made with intentions, though; theyre made with people and with equipment, and what Bigelow has her actors do for the benefit of the camera is repellent to imagine.\\"[45]\\r\\nTim Grierson and Will Leitch from The New Republic mentioned the film as a possible Academy Award candidate in the main category Best Picture, and mentioned John Boyega as a possible nominee for Best Actor.[46]","input":"What's the story behind the detroit movie?"},{"output":"New Avengers Annual #1","context":"Jessica Campbell Jones Cage[1] is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Michael Gaydos, and she first appeared in Alias #1 (November 2001), a Max imprint. Within the context of Marvel's shared universe, Jones is a former superhero who becomes the owner and sole employee of Alias Private Investigations. Bendis originally envisioned the series centered on Jessica Drew and only decided to create Jones once he noticed that the main character had a distinct voice and background that differentiated her from Drew.\\r\\nJones has since starred in three ongoing series, Alias, The Pulse and Jessica Jones. Alias ran for 28 issues before ending in 2004, while The Pulse ran for 14 issues from April 2004 to May 2006. Jessica Jones debuted in October 2016. She became a member of the New Avengers, alongside her husband, Luke Cage, during Marvel's 2010 Heroic Age campaign. She has used various aliases throughout her history, including Jewel, Knightress, and Power Woman. The character has been adapted into various forms of media outside of comic books; in 2015, she made her live-action debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with the Netflix television series Marvel's Jessica Jones, and in 2017's The Defenders, portrayed by Krysten Ritter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJessica Jones debuted in the Marvel MAX imprint series Alias, in November 2001. The character and series were created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Michael Gaydos. Alias ran for 28 issues from 2001 to 2004, with most covers drawn by David W. Mack. After the end of the series, Jones and other characters from the series moved to Bendis' subsequent series, The Pulse. In a 2005 interview,[2] Bendis claimed:\\r\\n\\"Originally, Alias was going to star Jessica Drew, but it became something else entirely. Which is good, because had we used Jessica, it would have been off continuity and bad storytelling.\\" Previously, Bendis commented, \\"I was at one time toying with doing Jessica Drew [in Alias] because she has the best hair of any superhero in comics, but this book is entirely different than what that idea was to be.\\"[3]\\r\\nBy the time Bendis was actively developing the title, Jones was his central character, one with a distinct background and voice from Drew's.[4]\\r\\nJessica Jones appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010ÿ2013 New Avengers series, from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue #34 (January 2013). In a Marvel Comics podcast, Bendis expressed his desire to incorporate Jones into the parallel universe Ultimate Marvel imprint.[5] In Ultimate Spider-Man #106, she appears as a senior at Peter Parker's school.\\r\\nMidtown High student Jessica Campbell goes to school with Peter Parker, on whom she has a crush and is present when he is bitten by the irradiated spider which gives him radioactive powers.[6] Jessica's father receives tickets for Disney World from his boss Tony Stark. On the way home, their car collides with a military convoy carrying radioactive chemicals. Her family is killed, and she spends several months in a coma. Upon waking, she is placed in an orphanage and adopted by the Jones family.[6] Jessica later discovers that her radiation exposure granted her super strength, limited invulnerability, and flight. Jessica's adoptive parents re-enroll her at Midtown High, where she is ostracized by her classmates, especially Flash Thompson. Peter Parker (who has since become Spider-Man) senses in Jessica a kindred spiritsomeone who has also lost her family due to a tragic circumstance. Jessica mistakes his kind attention for pity and lashes out at him.[7] She later witnesses a fight between Spider-Man and the villain Sandman in her school. This inspires her to use her abilities for positive ends.[8]\\r\\nAs Jewel, Jones has a fairly uneventful superhero career until she intervenes in a disturbance at a restaurant involving Zebediah Killgrave, the Purple Man. Killgrave uses his power of mind control to place Jones under his command, psychologically torturing her and forcing her to aid his criminal schemes.[9] After Killgrave sends her to kill Daredevil at the Avengers Mansion, Jones is rescued by Carol Danvers, the only Avenger who actually knows her.[10] Jones undergoes psychic therapy with Jean Grey of the X-Men, who places a special mental command in Jones's subconscious to protect her from further mind control.[11] During this time, Jones develops a brief romantic relationship with S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Clay Quartermain.[10] Due to the traumatic violation of her mind by Killgrave and the fact that she was barely noticed missing for eight months, a demoralized and depressed Jones gives up her costumed superhero life.[12] She briefly adopts a darker identity as the Knightress and interrupts a crime meeting between the Owl and a mafioso, through which she meets up with fellow superhero Luke Cage. After defeating the Owl, she and Cage develop a lasting friendship.[13] No longer a superhero, Jones opens a private detective agency. Longtime friend Carol Danvers sets Jones up with Scott Lang (the second Ant-Man), and the two date for several months. She also has an off-and-on affair with Cage.[14] Killgrave, still obsessed with Jones, escapes from high-security incarceration, but with the mental defenses Grey gave her, Jones breaks his control and subsequently beats him to death.[11] Later, Cage and Jones admit their feelings for each other, and after she becomes pregnant with their child, they begin a committed relationship.[15]\\r\\nJones takes a leave from the detective business and joins the staff of the Daily Bugle as a superhero correspondent and consultant, becoming a main character of the comic book The Pulse, and a contributor to the same-name fictional newspaper supplement within. A pregnant Jones is attacked by the Green Goblin after the Bugle reported that he was secretly industrialist Norman Osborn. In response, Cage retaliates and Osborn is irrevocably exposed as the Goblin upon his defeat and incarceration. Jones quits her job with the Bugle after publisher J. Jonah Jameson uses the paper to smear the New Avengers. Jones and Cage are living together when she gives birth to their child, whom they name Danielle after Luke's best friend, Danny Rand.[13] Cage and Jones marry in New Avengers Annual #1.[16] Jones appears as a supporting character in Young Avengers until the series ended. She returns in Avengers: The Children's Crusade #6 in which she, Beast and Hawkeye attempted to defuse the situation between the Avengers and X-Men who were fighting over who was to punish the Scarlet Witch. She helps fight Doctor Doom and is present when Stature and the Vision are killed. She is seen hugging Hulkling in the final panel when the team is declared full-fledged Avengers by Captain America.\\r\\nIn Marvel's 2006ÿ2007 crossover storyline \\"Civil War\\", Jones and Cage reject Iron Man and Ms. Marvel's offer to join the Superhuman Registration Act. As part of the New Avengers, Jones moved into Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum, but after an attack involving the demonic villain the Hood, Jones, shaken by the experience and desperate to protect her child, left the New Avengers and registered for the Superhuman Registration Act, ending her relationship with Luke Cage for the time being.[17] Jones is among the heroes who emerge from the crashed Skrull ship wearing her Jewel costume, although it is later revealed this Jones was a Skrull.[18][19] The real Jessica Jones appears in Secret Invasion #7, in which she joins in the heroes' fight against the Skrulls and was able to be reunited with her husband. After the Skrull surrender, the Skrull impersonating Jarvis disappears with their daughter, leaving Jessica desperate.[20]\\r\\nJessica is unaware that Luke has asked Norman Osborn for help in their search for Danielle.[21] Osborn helped Luke recover Danielle, and Luke gave the baby back to Jessica.[22] Spider-Man revealed himself as Peter Parker to the New Avengers, leaving Jones shocked to see that her former classmate is Spider-Man. She then tells Peter of her former crush on him, only to find out that he did not recognize her all this time, let alone remember her name, only remembering her as \\"Coma Girl\\", upsetting her.[23] She later assists the Avengers in rescuing Clint after being captured by Norman Osborn.[24] Jessica reveals that she was inspired to become a superheroine after witnessing an early battle between Spider-Man and the Sandman. Peter then tries to convince Jessica to return to the life of a superhero, suggesting that she could provide a better example for her daughter by going into action as a hero rather than simply telling her daughter about her old career.[25][26]\\r\\nDuring the storylines of Marvel's 2010 \\"Heroic Age\\" branding campaign, Jessica, returned to her costumed identity of Jewel, became a member of the New Avengers when the title relaunched in June 2010.[27] She and Luke began searching for a nanny, interviewing characters featured from other comics set in the Marvel Universe. Ultimately, Squirrel Girl was chosen as Danielle's nanny.[28] In New Avengers #8, Jessica took the name Power Woman to both honor her husband, Power Man (Luke Cage), and to be a role model for their daughter.[29] However following several incidents revolving around Thule Society attacking Avengers Mansion,[30] and Norman Osborn's threat,[31] Jessica quit the team and went into hiding, realizing that it was too dangerous for Danielle to remain in Avengers Mansion due to the numerous potential threats.[32]\\r\\nJessica later appeared as an ally to the Mighty Avengers team formed by Luke Cage. Jessica and Danielle lived in the apartment of the Gem Theater, which was serving as the Mighty Avenger's base of operations. She and Luke would later be confronted by the Superior Spider-Man and his Spider Robots, who offered her a place on a different type of Avengers team that was to be run by him. Jessica swiftly found a babysitter for her child and refused before delivering a powerful punch to Spider-Man's face for his threat. The group was later backed up by She-Hulk and she and Jessica decided to go out for coffee. Jessica and Luke would later switch apartments with an old friend of Luke's named David Griffiths. While moving in, Jessica spoke to the Blue Marvel about what it's like to raise a child of superheroes and expressed both her support and annoyance at her husband's choice to start another team of Avengers.\\r\\nIn October 2016, a new ongoing series featuring the character, titled Jessica Jones, began. In 2017, a new onging Defenders series was launched, featuring Jessica as one of the main characters.\\r\\nAfter coming into contact with experimental chemicals and spending some time in a coma, Jessica emerged with superhuman abilities. She possesses superhuman strength, as well as flight, and can block mind control. She shows the capacity to lift a two-ton police car with little effort. Her strength allowed her to lift up a giant-sized Goliath by the nostrils and toss him a short distance, break Atlas' nose, and render her fellow superheroine Jessica Drew unconscious with a single punch to the face. She later withstood being punched by a human on Mutant-Growth Hormone and suffered only mild bruising and a bloody nose and was able to recover in moments after being shocked by Jessica Drew's venom blasts. Despite this resistance to harm, Jessica suffered severe injuries, including a damaged spine and neck, a detached retina, and a broken nose after being attacked by both the Vision and Iron Man.[10]\\r\\nJessica is also able to fly, and while she was able to fly quite well during her early years as a heroine, she has admitted that her flying ability degenerated while she was no longer an active hero. She has since displayed improved flying ability after joining the New Avengers.[volume?&?issue?needed]\\r\\nAfter her ordeal at the hands of the Purple Man, Jessica was given a degree of psionic protection by Jean Grey of the X-Men. This psionic protection was sufficient to protect Jessica against a second attack by the Purple Man, though she had to \\"trigger\\" this resistance on her own.[11]\\r\\nIn addition to her superhuman powers, Jessica is a skilled detective and investigative journalist.[33]\\r\\nMultiple versions of Jessica Jones have appeared in Marvel's multiverse. In the 2005 \\"House of M\\" storyline, Jessica was apparently dating Scott Lang.[34]\\r\\nIn What If,[35] Jones accepted Captain America's offer to work for S.H.I.E.L.D.. Perceiving that something was amiss with Wanda Maximoff (the Scarlet Witch), she alerted the other Avengers, ensuring that the catastrophic events depicted in \\"Avengers Disassembled\\" and \\"House of M\\" would never occur. Jessica married Captain America.\\r\\nIn Ultimate Spider-Man,[36] Jones appeared as a senior student in the school Peter Parker attended. She was the executive producer of the school's television network. She later became jealous of Mary Jane Watson's superior film skills. She attempted to deduce Spider-Man's secret identity for the school newspaper and may have been suspicious about Peter Parker. Later on after the events of Ultimatum, she claimed to have abandoned her attempts to figure out who Spider-Man was and instead wanted to focus on his heroics.[36]\\r\\nIn Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane, Jessica was a student at Mary-Jane's high school and was a former friend of Mary Jane until she became a goth. Mary-Jane spent more time with Jessica after her breakup with Ned Leeds and became more goth-like until Jessica told Mary Jane it wasn't her.\\r\\nOn November 20, 2015, Jessica Jones was released on Netflix, with the title character portrayed by Krysten Ritter as an adult[37][38] and by Elizabeth Cappuccino as a teenager. As a child, she was in a car accident that killed her parents and put her in a coma. After she regained consciousness, Jessica was legally adopted by talent agent Dorothy Walker, therefore becoming the adopted sister of Trish Walker. As an adult, Jessica crosses paths with Kilgrave and spends a year under his control, snapping out of it after she kills Luke Cage's wife Reva Connors on Kilgrave's orders. She suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of what Kilgrave did to her, and drinks to excess to numb her pain and guilt. Her Jewel costume from the comics appears briefly in the fifth episode of season 1, \\"AKA: The Sandwich Saved Me\\", although she refuses to wear it and rejects Trish's suggestion of Jewel as an alias, saying \\"Jewel is a stripper's name, a really slutty stripper. And if I wear that thing you're going to have to call me Camel Toe.\\"[39] In the eighth episode of Iron Fist, Joy Meachum indirectly mentions to her brother Ward that she hired Jessica in the past to take compromising pictures of members on the Rand Enterprises board of directors. Ritter reprised her role in The Defenders, a 2017 crossover miniseries.[40]","input":"When do luke cage and jessica jones marry?"},{"output":"Paul Ryan","context":"The Speaker of the House is the presiding officer of the United States House of Representatives. The office was established in 1789 by Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution. The Speaker is the political and parliamentary leader of the House of Representatives, and is simultaneously the House's presiding officer, leader of the body's majority party, and the institution's administrative head. Speakers also perform various other administrative and procedural functions. Given these several roles and responsibilities, the Speaker usually does not personally preside over debates. That duty is instead delegated to members of the House from the majority party. Neither does the Speaker regularly participate in floor debates or vote.\\r\\nThe Constitution does not require the Speaker to be an elected member of the House of Representatives, although every Speaker thus far has been.[3] The Speaker is second in the United States presidential line of succession, after the Vice President and ahead of the President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate.[4]\\r\\nThe current House Speaker is Congressman Paul Ryan from Wisconsin. He was elected to the office on October 29, 2015, and is the 54th person to serve as Speaker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe House of Representatives elects the Speaker of the House on the first day of every new Congress and in the event of the death, resignation or removal from the Chair of an incumbent Speaker.[5] The Clerk of the House of Representatives requests nominations: there are normally two, one from each major party (each party having previously met to decide on its nominee). The Clerk then calls the roll of the Representatives, each Representative indicating the surname of the candidate the Representative is supporting. Representatives are not restricted to voting for one of the nominated candidates and may vote for any person, even for someone who is not a member of the House at all. They may also abstain by voting \\"present\\".[6]\\r\\nAlthough no rule exists, based on tradition and practice from the earliest days of the nation, to be elected speaker a candidate must receive an absolute majority of all votes cast for individuals, i.e. excluding those who abstain. If no candidate wins such a majority, then the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected. The last time repeated votes were required was in 1923, when the Speaker was elected on the ninth ballot.[6]\\r\\nThe new Speaker is then sworn in by the Dean of the United States House of Representatives, the chamber's longest-serving member.\\r\\nIn modern practice, the Speaker is chosen by the majority party from among its senior leaders either when a vacancy in the office arrives or when the majority party changes. Previous Speakers have been minority leaders (when the majority party changes, as they are already the House party leader, and as the minority leader are usually their party's nominee for Speaker), or majority leaders (upon departure of the current Speaker in the majority party), assuming that the party leadership hierarchy is followed. In the past, other candidates have included chairpersons of influential standing committees.\\r\\nSo far, the Democrats have always elevated their minority leader to the speakership upon reclaiming majority control of the House. However, Republicans have not always followed this leadership succession pattern. In 1919, Republicans bypassed James Robert Mann, R-IL, who had been Minority Leader for eight years, and elected a backbencher representative, Frederick H. Gillett, R-MA, to be Speaker. Mann had \\"angered many Republicans by objecting to their private bills on the floor,\\" and was also a protg of autocratic Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon (R-IL18) who had been Speaker from 1903 to 1911, and was still in the House. Many members \\"suspected that he [Mann] would try to re-centralize power in his hands if elected Speaker.\\"[7] More recently, although Robert H. Michel was Minority Leader in 1994 when the Republicans regained control of the House in the 1994 midterm elections, he had already announced his retirement and had little or no involvement in the campaign, including the \\"Contract with America\\", which was unveiled six weeks before Election Day. Michel opted not to seek re-election because he had been isolated in the caucus by Minority Whip Newt Gingrich and other younger and more aggressive Congressmen.\\r\\nIt is expected that members of the House vote for their party's candidate. If they do not, they usually vote for someone else in their party or vote \\"present\\". Those who vote for the other party's candidate often face serious consequences, up to and including the loss of seniority. The last instance where a representative voted for the other party's candidate was in 2000, when Democrat Jim Traficant of Ohio voted for Republican Dennis Hastert. In response, the Democrats stripped him of his seniority and he lost all of his committee posts.\\r\\nIf the Speaker's party loses control of the House in an election, and if the Speaker and Majority Leader both remain in the leadership hierarchy, they would become the Minority Leader and Minority Whip, respectively. As the minority party has historically had one less leadership position after losing the Speaker's chair, there may be a contest for the remaining leadership positions; upon losing control of the House after the 2010 election, the Democrats created the position of Assistant Democratic Leader in order to prevent such a contest. Most Speakers whose party has lost control of the House have not returned to the party leadership (Tom Foley lost his seat, Dennis Hastert returned to the backbenches and resigned from the House in late 2007). However, Speakers Joseph William Martin, Jr. and Sam Rayburn did seek the post of Minority Leader in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Nancy Pelosi is the most recent example of an outgoing Speaker who was elected Minority Leader, after the Democrats lost control of the House in the 2010 elections.\\r\\nThe first Speaker was Frederick Muhlenberg: he was elected as a Pro-Administration candidate to the 1st Congress, an Anti-Administration candidate to the 2nd and 3rd Congresses, and a Republican candidate to the 4th Congress,[8] according to the Biographical Directory of Congress, though Oswald Seidensticker wrote that he was elected as a Federalist for the first four Congresses.[9]\\r\\nThe position of Speaker started to gain its partisan role and its power in legislative development under Henry Clay (1811ÿ1814, 1815ÿ1820, and 1823ÿ1825).[10] In contrast to many of his predecessors, Clay participated in several debates, and used his influence to procure the passage of measures he supportedfor instance, the declaration of the War of 1812, and various laws relating to Clay's \\"American System\\" economic plan. Furthermore, when no candidate received an Electoral College majority in the 1824 presidential election causing the President to be elected by the House, Speaker Clay threw his support to John Quincy Adams instead of Andrew Jackson, thereby ensuring Adams' victory. Following Clay's retirement in 1825, the power of the speakership once again began to decline, despite speakership elections becoming increasingly bitter. As the Civil War approached, several sectional factions nominated their own candidates, often making it difficult for any candidate to attain a majority. In 1855 and again in 1859, for example, the contest for Speaker lasted for two months before the House achieved a result. During this time, Speakers tended to have very short tenures. For example, from 1839 to 1863 there were eleven Speakers, only one of whom served for more than one term. To date, James K. Polk is the only Speaker of the House later elected President of the United States.\\r\\nTowards the end of the 19th century, the office of Speaker began to develop into a very powerful one. At the time, one of the most important sources of the Speaker's power was his position as Chairman of the Committee on Rules, which, after the reorganization of the committee system in 1880, became one of the most powerful standing committees of the House. Furthermore, several Speakers became leading figures in their political parties; examples include Democrats Samuel J. Randall, John Griffin Carlisle, and Charles F. Crisp, and Republicans James G. Blaine, Thomas Brackett Reed, and Joseph Gurney Cannon.\\r\\nThe power of the Speaker was greatly augmented during the tenure of the Republican Thomas Brackett Reed (1889ÿ1891, 1895ÿ1899). \\"Czar Reed\\", as he was called by his opponents,[11] sought to end the obstruction of bills by the minority, in particular by countering the tactic known as the \\"disappearing quorum\\".[12] By refusing to vote on a motion, the minority could ensure that a quorum would not be achieved, and that the result would be invalid. Reed, however, declared that members who were in the chamber but refused to vote would still count for the purposes of determining a quorum. Through these and other rulings, Reed ensured that the Democrats could not block the Republican agenda.\\r\\nThe speakership reached its apogee during the term of Republican Joseph Gurney Cannon (1903ÿ1911). Cannon exercised extraordinary control over the legislative process. He determined the agenda of the House, appointed the members of all committees, chose committee chairmen, headed the Rules Committee, and determined which committee heard each bill. He vigorously used his powers to ensure that Republican proposals were passed by the House. In 1910, however, Democrats and several dissatisfied Republicans joined together to strip Cannon of many of his powers, including the ability to name committee members and his chairmanship of the Rules Committee.[13] Fifteen years later, Speaker Nicholas Longworth restored much, but not all, of the lost influence of the position.\\r\\nOne of the most influential Speakers in history was Democrat Sam Rayburn.[14] Rayburn was the longest-serving Speaker in history, holding office from 1940 to 1947, 1949 to 1953, and 1955 to 1961. He helped shape many bills, working quietly in the background with House committees. He also helped ensure the passage of several domestic measures and foreign assistance programs advocated by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Rayburn's successor, Democrat John William McCormack (served 1962ÿ1971), was a somewhat less influential speaker, particularly because of dissent from younger members of the Democratic Party. During the mid-1970s, the power of the speakership once again grew under Democrat Carl Albert. The Committee on Rules ceased to be a semi-independent panel, as it had been since 1910. Instead, it once again became an arm of the party leadership. Moreover, in 1975, the Speaker was granted the authority to appoint a majority of the members of the Rules Committee. Meanwhile, the power of committee chairmen was curtailed, further increasing the relative influence of the Speaker.\\r\\nAlbert's successor, Democrat Tip O'Neill, was a prominent Speaker because of his public opposition to the policies of President Ronald Reagan. O'Neill is the longest continually serving Speaker, from 1977 through 1987. He challenged Reagan on domestic programs and on defense expenditures. Republicans made O'Neill the target of their election campaigns in 1980 and 1982 but Democrats managed to retain their majorities in both years.\\r\\nThe roles of the parties reversed in 1994 when, after spending forty years in the minority, the Republicans regained control of the House with the \\"Contract with America\\", an idea spearheaded by Minority Whip Newt Gingrich. Speaker Gingrich would regularly clash with Democratic President Bill Clinton, leading to the United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996, in which Clinton was largely seen to have prevailed. Gingrich's hold on the leadership was weakened significantly by that and several other controversies, and he faced a caucus revolt in 1997. After the Republicans lost House seats in 1998 (although retaining a majority) he did not stand for a third term as Speaker. His successor, Dennis Hastert, had been chosen as a compromise candidate, since the other Republicans in the leadership were more controversial. Hastert played a much less prominent role than other contemporary Speakers, being overshadowed by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and President George W. Bush. The Republicans came out of the 2000 elections with a further reduced majority but made small gains in 2002 and 2004. The periods of 2001ÿ2002 and 2003ÿ2007 were the first times since 1953ÿ1955 that there was single-party Republican leadership in Washington, interrupted from 2001ÿ2003 as Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party to become independent and caucused with Senate Democrats to give them a 51-49 majority.\\r\\nIn the 2006 midterm elections, the Democrats won a majority in the House. Nancy Pelosi became Speaker when the 110th Congress convened on January 4, 2007, making her the first female to hold the office. With the election of Barack Obama as President and Democratic gains in both houses of Congress, Pelosi became the first Speaker since Tom Foley to hold the office during single-party Democratic leadership in Washington.[15] During the 111th Congress, Pelosi was the driving force behind several of Obama's major initiatives that proved controversial, and the Republicans campaigned against the Democrats' legislation by staging a \\"Fire Pelosi\\" bus tour[16] and regained control of the House in the 2010 midterm elections. House Minority Leader John Boehner was elected as Speaker.[17]\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, there have been several controversial elections to the speakership, such as the contest of 1839. In that case, even though the 26th United States Congress convened on December 2, the House could not begin the speakership election until December 14 because of an election dispute in New Jersey known as the \\"Broad Seal War\\". Two rival delegations, one Whig and the other Democrat, had been certified as elected by different branches of the New Jersey government. The problem was compounded by the fact that the result of the dispute would determine whether the Whigs or the Democrats held the majority. Neither party agreed to permit a speakership election with the opposite party's delegation participating. Finally, it was agreed to exclude both delegations from the election and a Speaker was finally chosen on December 17.\\r\\nAnother, more prolonged fight occurred in 1855 in the 34th United States Congress. The old Whig Party had collapsed but no single party had emerged to replace it. Candidates opposing the Democrats had run under a bewildering variety of labels, including Whig, Republican, American (Know Nothing), and simply \\"Opposition\\". By the time Congress actually met in December 1855, most of the northerners were concentrated together as Republicans, while most of the southerners and a few northerners used the American or Know Nothing label. Opponents of the Democrats held a majority in House, with the party makeup of the 234 Representatives being 83 Democrats, 108 Republicans, and 43 Know Nothings (primarily southern oppositionists). The Democratic minority nominated William Alexander Richardson of Illinois as Speaker, but because of sectional distrust, the various oppositionists were unable to agree on a single candidate for Speaker. The Republicans supported Nathaniel Prentiss Banks of Massachusetts, who had been elected as a Know Nothing but was now largely identified with the Republicans. The southern Know Nothings supported first Humphrey Marshall of Kentucky, and then Henry M. Fuller of Pennsylvania. The voting went on for almost two months with no candidate able to secure a majority, until it was finally agreed to elect the Speaker by plurality vote, and Banks was elected.[19] The House found itself in a similar dilemma when the 36th Congress met in December 1859. Although the Republicans held a plurality, the Republican candidate, John Sherman, was unacceptable to southern oppositionists due to his anti-slavery views, and once again the House was unable to elect a Speaker for several months. After Democrats allied with southern oppositionists to nearly elect the North Carolina oppositionist William N. H. Smith, Sherman finally withdrew in favor of compromise candidate William Pennington of New Jersey, a former Whig of unclear partisan loyalties, who was finally elected Speaker at the end of January 1860.[20]\\r\\nThe last speakership elections in which the House had to vote more than once occurred in the 65th and 72nd United States Congress. In 1917, neither the Republican nor the Democratic candidate could attain a majority because three members of the Progressive Party and other individual members of other parties voted for their own party. The Republicans had a plurality in the House but James \\"Champ\\" Clark remained Speaker of the House because of the support of the Progressive Party members. In 1931, both the Republicans and the Democrats had 217 members with the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party having one member who served as the deciding vote. The Farmer-Labor Party eventually voted for the Democrats' candidate for Speaker, John Nance Garner, who later became Vice President under Franklin Roosevelt.\\r\\nIn 1997, several Republican congressional leaders tried to force Speaker Newt Gingrich to resign. However, Gingrich refused since that would have required a new election for Speaker, which could have led to Democrats along with dissenting Republicans voting for Democrat Dick Gephardt (then Minority Leader) as Speaker. After the 1998 midterm elections where the Republicans lost seats, Gingrich did not stand for re-election. The next two figures in the House Republican leadership hierarchy, Majority Leader Richard Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay, chose not to run for the office. The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Bob Livingston, declared his bid for the speakership, which was unopposed, making him Speaker-designate. It was then revealed, by Livingston himself, who had been publicly critical of President Bill Clinton's perjury during his sexual harassment trial, that he had engaged in an extramarital affair. He opted to resign from the House, despite being urged to stay on by House Democratic leader Gephardt. Subsequently, chief deputy whip Dennis Hastert was selected as Speaker. The Republicans retained their majorities in the 2000, 2002, and 2004 elections.\\r\\nThe Democrats won a majority of seats in the 2006 midterm elections. On November 16, 2006, Nancy Pelosi, who was then Minority Leader, was selected as Speaker-designate by House Democrats.[21] When the 110th Congress convened on January 4, 2007, she was elected as the 52nd Speaker by a vote of 233-202, becoming the first woman elected Speaker of the House.[22] Pelosi remained Speaker through the 111th Congress. For the 112th Congress, Republican John Boehner was unanimously designated Speaker-designate by House Republicans and was elected the 53rd Speaker of the House. As a show of dissent, nineteen Democratic representatives voted for Democrats other than Pelosi, who had been chosen as House Minority Leader and the Democrats' candidate for Speaker.\\r\\nThe Constitution does not spell out the political role of the Speaker. As the office has developed historically, however, it has taken on a clearly partisan cast, very different from the speakership of most Westminster-style legislatures, such as the Speaker of the British House of Commons, which is meant to be scrupulously non-partisan. The Speaker in the United States, by tradition, is the head of the majority party in the House of Representatives, outranking the Majority Leader. However, despite having the right to vote, the Speaker usually does not participate in debate and rarely votes.\\r\\nThe Speaker is responsible for ensuring that the House passes legislation supported by the majority party. In pursuing this goal, the Speaker may use their power to determine when each bill reaches the floor. They also chair the majority party's steering committee in the House. While the Speaker is the functioning head of the House majority party, the same is not true of the President pro tempore of the Senate, whose office is primarily ceremonial and honorary.\\r\\nWhen the Speaker and the President belong to the same party, the Speaker tends to play the role in a more ceremonial light, as seen when Dennis Hastert played a very low-key role during the presidency of fellow Republican George W. Bush. Nevertheless, there are times when the Speaker plays a much larger role if the President is a fellow member of their party, and thus, the Speaker is tasked with pushing through the agenda of the majority party, often at the expense of the minority opposition. This can be seen, most of all, in the speakership of Democratic-Republican Henry Clay, who personally ensured the presidential victory of fellow Democratic-Republican John Quincy Adams. Democrat Sam Rayburn was a key player in the passing of New Deal legislation under the presidency of fellow Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Republican Joseph Gurney Cannon (under Theodore Roosevelt) was particularly infamous for his marginalization of the minority Democrats and centralizing of authority to the speakership. In more recent times, Speaker Nancy Pelosi played a role in continuing the push for health care reform during the presidency of fellow Democrat Barack Obama.[23] The Republicans campaigned against Pelosi and the Democrats' legislation with their \\"Fire Pelosi\\" bus tour.[16]\\r\\nOn the other hand, when the Speaker and the President belong to opposite parties, the public role and influence of the Speaker tend to increase. As the highest-ranking member of the opposition party (and de facto Leader of the Opposition), the Speaker is normally the chief public opponent of the President's agenda. In this scenario, the Speaker is known for undercutting the President's agenda by blocking measures by the minority party or rejecting bills by the Senate. One famous instance came in the form of Thomas Brackett Reed (under Grover Cleveland), a Speaker notorious for his successful attempt to force the Democrats to vote on measures where the Republicans had clear majorities, which ensured that Cleveland's Democrats were in no position to challenge the Republicans in the House. Joseph Cannon was particularly unique in that he led the conservative \\"Old Guard\\" wing of the Republican Party, while his President ÿ Theodore Roosevelt ÿ was of the more progressive clique, and more than just marginalizing the Democrats, Cannon used his power to punish the dissidents in his party and obstruct the progressive wing of the Republican Party.\\r\\nMore modern examples include Tip O'Neill, who was a vocal opponent of President Ronald Reagan's economic and defense policies; Newt Gingrich, who fought a bitter battle with President Bill Clinton for control of domestic policy; Nancy Pelosi, who argued with President George W. Bush over the Iraq War;[17] and John Boehner, who clashed with President Barack Obama over budget issues and health care.[24]\\r\\nAs presiding officer of the House of Representatives, the Speaker holds a variety of powers over the House and is ceremonially the highest-ranking legislative official in the US government.[25] The Speaker may delegate his powers to a member of the House to act as Speaker pro tempore and preside over the House in the Speaker's absence; when this has occurred the delegation has always been to a member of the same party.[26] During important debates, the Speaker pro tempore is ordinarily a senior member of the majority party who may be chosen for his skill in presiding. At other times, more junior members may be assigned to preside to give them experience with the rules and procedures of the House. The Speaker may also designate, with approval of the House, a Speaker pro tempore for special purposes, such as designating a Representative whose district is near Washington, D.C. to sign enrolled bills during long recesses.\\r\\nUnder the Rules of the House, the Speaker, \\"as soon as practicable after the election of the Speaker and whenever appropriate thereafter,\\" must deliver to the Clerk of the House a confidential list of Members who are designated to act as Speaker in the case of a vacancy or physical inability of the Speaker to perform their duties.[27]\\r\\nOn the floor of the House, the presiding officer is always addressed as \\"Mister Speaker\\" or \\"Madam Speaker,\\" even if it is a Speaker pro tempore, and not the Speaker themselves. When the House resolves itself into a Committee of the Whole, the Speaker designates a member to preside over the Committee as the Chairman, who is addressed as \\"Mister Chairman\\" or \\"Madam Chairwoman.\\" To speak, members must seek the presiding officer's recognition. The presiding officer also rules on all points of order but such rulings may be appealed to the whole House. The Speaker is responsible for maintaining decorum in the House and may order the Sergeant-at-Arms to enforce House rules.\\r\\nThe Speaker's powers and duties extend beyond presiding in the chamber. In particular, the Speaker has great influence over the committee process. The Speaker selects nine of the thirteen members of the powerful Committee on Rules, subject to the approval of the entire majority party. The leadership of the minority party chooses the remaining four members. Furthermore, the Speaker appoints all members of select committees and conference committees. Moreover, when a bill is introduced, the Speaker determines which committee will consider it. As a member of the House, the Speaker is entitled to participate in debate and to vote but, by custom, only does so in exceptional circumstances. Ordinarily, the Speaker votes only when the Speaker's vote would be decisive or on matters of great importance, such as constitutional amendments or major legislation.[28]\\r\\nBecause joint sessions and joint meetings of Congress are held in the House chamber, the Speaker presides over joint sessions to hear addresses by the President, and joint meetings to hear addresses from foreign leaders or other invited guests. However, the Twelfth Amendment and 3 U.S.C.??15 require that the President of the Senate preside over joint sessions of Congress assembled to count electoral votes and to certify the results of a presidential election.\\r\\nThe Speaker is also responsible for overseeing the officers of the House: the Clerk, the Sergeant-at-Arms, the Chief Administrative Officer, and the Chaplain. The Speaker can dismiss any of these officers. The Speaker appoints the House Historian and the General Counsel and, jointly with the Majority and Minority Leaders, appoints the House Inspector General.\\r\\nThe Speaker is second in the presidential line of succession, immediately after the Vice President, under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. The Speaker is followed in the line of succession by the President pro tempore of the Senate and by the heads of federal executive departments.\\r\\nTo date, the implementation of the Presidential Succession Act has never been necessary and no Speaker has ever acted as President. Implementation of the law almost became necessary in 1973 after the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew. At the time, many believed that President Richard Nixon would resign because of the Watergate scandal, allowing Speaker Carl Albert to succeed to the Presidency. However, before he resigned, Nixon appointed Gerald Ford as Vice President in accordance with the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Nevertheless, the United States government takes the Speaker's place in the line of succession seriously enough that, for example, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Speakers used military jets to fly back and forth to their districts and for other travel until Speaker Boehner discontinued the practice in 2011. The Speaker of the House is one of the officers to whom declarations of presidential inability or ability to resume the Presidency must be addressed under the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\\r\\nTo be elected as Speaker, a candidate must receive an absolute majority of all votes cast for individuals, excluding those who abstain.[29]\\r\\nSource: Election of the Speaker Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives.

As of 2016, it is the seventh-largest brewing company in the United States.[2] The brewery produced 786,000 barrels of beer (922,353 hectoliters) in 2010.[3]\\r\\nThe brewery was named \\"Green Business of the Year\\" by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 2010 for its practices in sustainability.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSierra Nevada Brewing Co. was founded in 1979, with founders Ken Grossman and Paul Camusi expanding their homebrewing hobby into a brewery in Chico, California. Along with the brewery's location, Grossman claims the company's name comes from his love of hiking in the mountains of the Sierra Nevada.[5] With $50,000 in loans from friends and family, Grossman and Camusi rented a 3,000-square-foot (280?m2) warehouse and pieced together discarded dairy equipment and scrapyard metal to create their brewing equipment.[6][7] They later were able to acquire second-hand copper brewing kettles from Germany before moving to their larger, current brewing facility in 1989.[8]\\r\\nThe first batch brewed on premises was its Pale Ale,[9] in November 1980.[5] The following year, the brewery introduced Celebration, an IPA, which it continues to release as a winter seasonal. The company sold 950 barrels of beer in its first year, and double that amount in the second.[6]\\r\\nThe company's first employee was Steve Harrison, who was put in charge of marketing and sales.[10] The head brewer is Steve Dresler, who has been with the brewery since 1983, when its output was 25 to 30 barrels per week.\\r\\nThe company distributed the beer itself in the early 1980s, struggling with financial and marketing problems. A 1982 article in the San Francisco Chronicle highlighting the brewery, as well as having its beer sold in prominent restaurants such as Berkeley's Chez Panisse, helped establish a market for Sierra Nevada's beer.[11]\\r\\nBy 1987, the brewery was distributing to seven states and production had reached 12,000 barrels per year, causing the company to pursue building a new brewery.[10] In 1988, the brewery moved into a 100-barrel brewhouse, with four open fermenters, and 11 200-barrel secondary fermenters. A year later, Grossman and Camusi added the Sierra Nevada Taproom and Restaurant, which serves lunch and dinner and included a giftshop. In 2000, the brewery opened \\"The Big Room\\", a live-music venue located inside the brewery's facilities, featuring a variety of acts including country, bluegrass, folk, rock, blues, and other musical genres.[10]\\r\\nCamusi retired in 1998 and sold his share in the company to Grossman.[10]\\r\\nIn 2010, Sierra Nevada Brewing partnered with the Abbey of New Clairvaux, with the monastery beginning production of Trappist-style beers in 2011. The Abbey has not yet been sanctioned by the International Trappist Association, and therefore the monastery will not be brewing official Trappist beer.[12]\\r\\nThe brewery employed about 450 people in 2011.[13]\\r\\nIn January 2012, Sierra Nevada announced it would build a second brewing facility with an attached restaurant in Mills River, North Carolina. It opened in early 2014.[14] In 2013, the company opened the \\"Torpedo Room\\" in Berkeley, their first tasting room outside of Chico.[15]\\r\\nIn January 2017, Sierra Nevada issued a voluntary recall of certain 12oz bottles of different beers in 36 states due to a manufacturing defect that had possibly chipped pieces of glass into the bottle.[16]\\r\\nAlong with Anchor Brewing Company in San Francisco and the now-defunct New Albion Brewing Company in Sonoma, whose owners offered Grossman and Camusi early guidance in their venture, Sierra Nevada is considered one of the earliest and most influential breweries which spawned the craft beer movement of the 1980s-90s.[6][9] Grossman has been dubbed a \\"pioneer\\" by fellow craft brewers in the United States.[11]\\r\\nWhereas many of the newly spawned microbreweries of the 1980s went out of business, Sierra Nevada Brewing endured to become one of the largest independent brewers in the country, whose beers were noted for their \\"character and complexity\\".[6][7] Grossman believed many microbrewers of the early 1980s had put out an inferior product due to lack of preparation for the financial and mechanical realities of commercial brewing, which were a \\"much different process\\" from homebrewing.[6]\\r\\nFor its 30th anniversary in 2010, the company released a series of collaborative beers with the assistance of those Grossman considered an early influence on his brewing: Charlie Papazian, Fred Eckhardt, Fritz Maytag (Anchor) and Jack McAuliffe (New Albion).[11]\\r\\nIn November 2010, Stansbury Publishing released Hops and Dreams: The Story of Sierra Nevada Brewing Co, written by California State University, Chico professor Rob Burton who researched the company for three years.[17]\\r\\nThe company has claimed to be neutral on political issues, and reiterated this stance in 2010 when it was erroneously linked by a beer industry group to opposing the California Proposition 19 of that year, which would have legalized marijuana in the state.[18]\\r\\nSierra Nevada Brewing Co. won the US Environmental Protection Agency's \\"Green Business of the Year\\" award for 2010.[19]\\r\\nThe brewery is powered by solar energy, having 10,000 photovoltaic modules covering its rooftops and parking lot.[20] In all, the brewery uses 2.6 megawatts of solar electricity on premises.[21] It also has built a charging station for electric vehicles on its premises.[1]\\r\\nThe company uses a small-scale BioPro?[22] biodiesel processor to convert the used cooking oil from its restaurant for biodiesel use in its delivery trucks. In 2009, it reached an agreement with a local ethanol company to produce high-grade ethanol fuel from its discarded yeast.[23] Spent grain is sold to local cattle ranchers for livestock feed; spent water is sent to the brewery's own water treatment plant, where it is reused, mainly as drip irrigation for its fields.[24] Over 99.5% of the brewery plant's solid waste is diverted from landfill.[24]\\r\\nThe company owns one mile of railway for use in intermodal freight transport, which aids in reducing the brewery's carbon footprint. Each rail car can hold the equivalent of four semi-trailers of grain;[25] rail transport is more fuel efficient than road transport.\\r\\nSierra Nevada is the largest buyer of organic hops in the United States.[19] It also farms its own organic hops and barley for use in its annual Chico Estate Harvest Ale release.[26]\\r\\nThe brewery's year-round offerings include its Pale Ale, Porter, Stout, Torpedo 'Extra' IPA, Kellerweis Hefeweizen, Nooner Pilsner, and Hop Hunter IPA.\\r\\nSierra's flagship Pale Ale has been described as \\"a balance between aggressive hops and hearty malt flavor\\", with its Cascade hops offering a grapefruit aroma and fruity palate.[27] Like several other Sierra Nevada offerings, it is bottle-conditioned.[28] It is the best-selling pale ale in the United States as of 2012.[8][29][30]\\r\\nSierra Nevada's Porter, along with its heavier Stout version, have been described by writer Michael Jackson as \\"gently coffeish\\" and \\"beautifully roasty\\" examples of their respective styles.[31] The two offerings have been brewed since the company's first year of operation.[11]\\r\\nTorpedo is an American India Pale Ale and Kellerweis is a traditional Bavarian hefeweizen. Both were introduced as nationwide offerings in 2009.[32][33]\\r\\nThe brewery's current lineup of seasonals include Beer Camp Hoppy Lager, Summerfest pilsner, Oktoberfest, and Celebration Ale.\\r\\nSierra Nevada's Celebration Ale has been brewed as a winter seasonal since 1981. While it has won medals under the IPA category,[34] it has also been described as a hoppy, malty amber ale,[35] as well as a \\"bigger version\\" of the company's pale ale.[36]\\r\\nPrevious Autumn seasonal Tumbler Brown Ale has been described as a full-bodied, malt-heavy brown ale[37] and is sold for the autumn months.\\r\\nPrevious Spring seasonal Ruthless Rye IPA is an IPA brewed with rye and whole-cone hops for the spring, while Summerfest is a pilsner brewed in the Czech tradition.[38]\\r\\nAnnual \\"Special Release\\" beers produced by Sierra Nevada include Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale, Hemisphere Harvest Ales and Chico Harvest Estate Ale.\\r\\nBigfoot is brewed with two types of malt and three differing hops, and tops out at 9.6%ABV. It is a barleywine, but due to alcohol laws in the U.S. it must be marketed as a \\"barleywine style ale\\". Only alcohols derived from fruits, not grains, can be marketed as wine.[39] It first won medals at the Great American Beer Festival in 1987.[40] It is generally released JanuaryÿFebruary of each year.\\r\\nThe brewery releases both a Northern and Southern Hemisphere Harvest \\"wet hop\\" ale. Introduced in 1996 as Harvest Ale, Northern Hemisphere utilizes wet (undried) hops from eastern Washington for its \\"fresh harvest\\" ale. It was the first fresh-hop ale brewed in the United States.[41] The brewery later introduced Southern Hemisphere which features wet hops from New Zealand.\\r\\nThe Chico Estate Harvest Ale is brewed with organic wet hops and barley grown in land on the brewery's premises.[24]\\r\\nOld Chico Crystal Wheat, a wheat beer, is named in memory of the Chico Brewery which operated in the town during the 19th century.[17] Old Chico brand beers are only distributed in the northern California area around Chico.\\r\\nCoordinates: 394329.7N 1214846.9W? / ?39.724917N 121.813028W? / 39.724917; -121.813028","input":"How many barrels of beer does sierra nevada produce?"},{"output":"James Kerr","context":"James Kerr (born 9 July 1959) is a Scottish singer-songwriter and the lead singer of the rock band Simple Minds.

His great size and his continued growth in adulthood were due to hyperplasia of his pituitary gland, which results in an abnormally high level of human growth hormone. He showed no indication of an end to his growth even at the time of his death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWadlow was born in Alton, Illinois on February 22, 1918 to Harold Franklin and Addie May (Johnson) Wadlow, and was the oldest of five children. He was taller than his father by the age of 8, and in elementary school they had to make a special desk for him due to his size. By the time he had graduated from Alton High School in 1936, he was 8?ft 4?in (2.54?m).[1] After graduating he enrolled in Shurtleff College with the intention of studying law.\\r\\nWadlow's size began to take its toll: he required leg braces to walk and had little feeling in his legs and feet. Despite these difficulties, he never used a wheelchair.\\r\\nWadlow became a celebrity after his 1936 U.S. tour with the Ringling Brothers Circus. In 1938, he did a promotional tour with the International Shoe Company. They provided him his shoes free of charge. Examples of the shoes still exist in several locations throughout the U.S., including Snyder's Shoe Store of Ludington and Manistee, Michigan, and the Alton Museum of History and Art. He continued participating in tours and public appearances, though only in his normal street clothes.[7] He possessed great physical strength until the last year of his life, when his strength and his health in general began to deteriorate rapidly.[citation needed]\\r\\nWadlow was a member of the Order of DeMolay, the Masonic-sponsored organization for young men. He was also a Freemason. In 1939, he petitioned Franklin Lodge #25 in Alton, Illinois, and by late November of that year[8] was raised to the degree of Master Mason under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Illinois A.F. and A.M.. His Freemason ring was the largest ever made.[citation needed]\\r\\nOne year before his death, Wadlow passed John Rogan as the tallest person ever. On June 27, 1940 (18 days before his death), he was measured at 8?ft 11.1?in (2.72?m) by doctors C. M. Charles and Cyril MacBryde of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.[1]\\r\\nOn July 4, 1940, during a professional appearance at the Manistee National Forest Festival, a faulty brace irritated his ankle, causing a blister and subsequent infection. Doctors treated him with a blood transfusion and emergency surgery, but his condition worsened due to an autoimmune disorder, and on July 15, 1940, 11 days after contracting the infection, he died in his sleep at the age of 22.[9][1] His coffin measured 10?feet 9?inches (3.28?m) long by 32 inches (81?cm) wide by 30 inches (76?cm) deep, weighed 1,000 pounds (450?kg) and was carried by twelve pallbearers and eight assistants.[1][10][11] His body was buried at Oakwood Cemetery in Upper Alton, Madison County, Illinois.\\r\\nA life-size statue of Wadlow stands on College Avenue in Alton, opposite the Alton Museum of History and Art.

The executive producers for the first production season were Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series was originally set to debut in autumn 1989 with the episode \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\", which was meant to introduce the main characters;[2] during the first screening of the episode, the producers discovered that the animation was so appalling that 70% of the episode needed to be redone.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe producers considered aborting the series if the next episode turned out as bad, but it only suffered from easily fixable problems.

Brooks's office. Brooks, the producer of the sketch comedy program The Tracey Ullman Show, wanted to use a series of animated shorts as bumpers between sketches. He had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series. When Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life's work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Simpson family first appeared as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987.[6] Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production. The animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1989, a team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a half-hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The team included what is now the Klasky Csupo animation house. During the years of producing the shorts, everything was created in-house. Due to the increased workload of the full-length episodes, production was subcontracted to South Korean animation studio AKOM.[8] While character and background layout is done by the domestic studio, tweening, coloring, and filming are done by the overseas studio.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Simpsons was co-developed by Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon, a writer-producer with whom Brooks had worked on previous projects. Groening and Simon, however, did not get along[9] and were often in conflict over the show;[10] Groening once described their relationship as \\"very contentious\\".[11] Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called \\"the mainstream trash\\" that they were watching.[12] Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content.[13] Fox was nervous about the show because they were unsure if it could sustain the audience's attention for the duration of the episode.[2] They proposed doing three seven-minute shorts per episode and four specials until the audience adjusted,[2] but in the end, the producers gambled by asking Fox for 13 full-length episodes.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimon assembled and led the initial team of writers, consisting of John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, George Meyer, Jeff Martin, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky.[15][16] Simon has been credited as \\"developing [the show's] sensibility\\".[17] Ken Levine says he \\"brought a level of honesty to the characters\\" and made them \\"three-dimensional\\", adding that Simon's \\"comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In The Simpsons, the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking?'that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters.\\"[17] Simon saw The Simpsons as a chance to solve \\"what [he] didn't like about the Saturday-morning cartoon shows [he had] worked on...[he] wanted all the actors in a room together, not reading their lines separated from each other. The Simpsons would have been a great radio show. If you just listen to the sound track, it works.\\"[17] The music for all 13 episodes was composed by former Oingo Boingo member Richard Gibbs,[18] who would depart the show at the end of the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series was originally set to debut in the fall of 1989 with the episode \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\", which was meant to introduce the main characters.[2] A debacle erupted when the episode \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\", the first to return from animation in Korea, was screened in front of the production staff at the Gracie Films bungalow.[2] The executive producer and developer James L. Brooks' initial reaction to the animation was \\"This is shit.\\"[2] After that reaction the room almost cleared.[2] A heated argument ensued between Brooks and Klasky-Csupo animation studio head Gbor Csup܇, who denied that there was anything wrong with the animation and suggested that the real problem was the quality of the show's writing.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with the animation from the producers' point-of-view was that it did not exhibit a distinct style envisioned for the show. At the time there were only a few choices for animation style. Usually, they would either follow the style of Disney, Warner Bros., or Hanna-Barbera. Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons had a universe that was bendy and the characters seemed to be made of rubber.[2] The producers wanted a realistic environment in which the characters and objects could not do anything that was not possible in the real world. One example with the early animation being cartoonish was that the doors behaved liked rubber when slammed. The style of Hanna-Barbera featured the use of cartoon sounds, which they did not want either.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, during the first screening of the episode, the producers discovered that the animation was so appalling that 70% of the episode needed to be redone.[3] The producers considered aborting the series if the next episode (\\"Bart the Genius\\") turned out as bad, but it only suffered from a few, easily fixable problems. The producers convinced Fox to move the debut to December 17, and aired \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\" as the first episode of the series.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe half hour series premiere debuted on December 17, 1989 with \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\" a Christmas special. The next episode \\"Bart the Genius\\" was the first to feature the series' full title sequence, including the chalkboard gag and couch gag. Matt Groening developed the lengthy sequence in order to cut down on the animation necessary for each episode, but devised the two gags as compensation for the repeated material each week.[20] Groening, who had not paid much attention to television since his own childhood, was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time.[20] As the finished episodes became longer, the production team were reluctant to cut the stories in order to allow for the long title sequence, so shorter versions of it were developed.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some of the episodes the characters act completely differently to how they do in later seasons; Lisa, for example, is undisciplined and short-tempered, while Homer is the voice of reason; these roles are reversed in later episodes.[22] Mr. Burns was voiced by Christopher Collins in \\"Homer's Odyssey\\". Originally, the character was influenced by Ronald Reagan, a concept which was later dropped.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first episode featured many new characters such as Seymour Skinner, Milhouse Van Houten, Sherri and Terri, Moe Szyslak, Mr. Burns, Barney Gumble, Patty and Selma, Ned and Todd Flanders, Santa's Little Helper, Snowball II, Dewey Largo, and Lewis.[23] Snowball I is mentioned for the first time and Waylon Smithers can be heard over the speaker at the power plant, but he is not seen.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following episodes in the season saw the introduction of several new recurring characters, including Martin Prince, Richard, Edna Krabappel, Dr. J Loren Pryor,[24] Waylon Smithers, Otto Mann, Chief Wiggum, Jasper Beardley, Sam & Larry, Mr. & Mrs. Winfield, Sherri and Terri,[25] Dr. Marvin Monroe, Eddie and Lou,[26] Nelson Muntz, Herman,[27] Bleeding Gums Murphy, Jacqueline Bouvier,[28] Sideshow Bob, Reverend Timothy Lovejoy, Krusty the Clown, Jimbo Jones, Kearney Zzyzwicz, Dolphin \\"Dolph\\" Starbeam, Ms. Albright, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,[29] Lenny and Carl, Kent Brockman and Agnes Skinner.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Simpsons first season was the Fox network's first TV series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows.[31] It won one Emmy Award, and received four additional nominations. Although television shows are limited to one episode a category, \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\" was considered a separate special, and nominated alongside fellow episode \\"Life on the Fast Lane\\" for Outstanding Animated Program; \\"Life on the Fast Lane\\" won the award. \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\" was also nominated for \\"Outstanding Editing in a Miniseries or Special\\", while \\"The Call of the Simpsons\\" was nominated for \\"Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Comedy Series or a Special\\".

The rebellious lead character at the time, Bart, frequently received no punishment for his misbehavior, which led some parents to characterize him as a poor role model for children.[32][33] Several US public schools even banned The Simpsons merchandise and t-shirts, such as one featuring Bart and the caption \\"Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')\\".[34] Despite the ban, The Simpsons merchandise sold well and generated US$2 billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nBart has trouble on an intelligence test and sneakily switches tests with Martin Prince, the class genius. After the results are tabulated, the school psychiatrist labels Bart a genius and sends him to the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children.

He confesses that he cheated on the test and is subsequently sent back to Springfield Elementary School.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nBart becomes friends with Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney, a group of local troublemakers.

Feeling remorse, Bart confesses to his family and Homer and Bart take the head back to the statue after passing through the furious people.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincipal Skinner finally becomes fed up with Bart's pranks and proposes that Bart be sent to France as part of the student exchange program. The family agrees and Bart is sent to the \\"beautiful\\" Chateau Maison, which is actually a dilapidated farmhouse on a neglected vineyard. Bart is treated like a slave by two unscrupulous winemakers, Csar and Ugolin, who eventually feed him wine tainted with antifreeze. Meanwhile, an Albanian boy named Adil starts to live with the Simpsons who, unbeknownst to Homer, is a spy sent by his country to obtain nuclear blueprints. Back in France, Bart learns French and reports the winemakers' crimes to the authorities.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile buying ice cream at the Kwik-E-Mart, Homer witnesses a robbery perpetrated by a man believed to be Krusty the Clown, host of \\"Krusty the Clown Show\\", Bart's favorite program. Krusty is sent to jail and his show is taken over by his assistant, Sideshow Bob. Bart is certain that Krusty is innocent, and gathers evidence to support his claim, which he takes to \\"Krusty's bestest friend\\", Sideshow Bob. Bart realizes that the robbery was actually committed by Bob, who was trying to frame Krusty.

It is an adaptation of the 1986 non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese. The film narrates the rise and fall of mob associate Henry Hill and his friends and family over a period from 1955 to 1980.\\r\\n\\r\\nScorsese initially titled the film Wise Guy and postponed making it; later, he and Pileggi changed the title to Goodfellas. To prepare for their roles in the film, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do whatever they wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked best and put them into a revised script, which the cast worked from during principal photography.\\r\\n\\r\\nMade on a budget of $25 million, Goodfellas grossed $46.8 million. It received positive reviews from critics and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, with Pesci winning for Best Supporting Actor. The film won five awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, including Best Film and Best Director. Additionally, Goodfellas was named the year's best film by various critics' groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoodfellas has been called one of the greatest films in the crime genre. In 2000, it was deemed \\"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\\" and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress. Its content and style have been emulated in numerous other films and television shows.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1955, Henry Hill, a high school student, becomes enamored with the criminal life in his neighborhood, and begins working for Paul \\"Paulie\\" Cicero and his associates: James \\"Jimmy the Gent\\" Conway, a truck hijacker; and Tommy DeVito, a fellow juvenile delinquent. Henry begins as fence for Jimmy, gradually working his way up to more serious crimes. Enjoying the perks of their criminal life, the three associates spend most of their nights at the Copacabana nightclub, carousing with women. Henry meets and later marries Karen Friedman, a Jewish woman from the Five Towns area of Long Island. Karen is initially troubled by Henry's criminal activities, but is soon seduced by his glamorous lifestyle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1970, Billy Batts, a mobster in the Gambino crime family, repeatedly insults Tommy at a nightclub owned by Henry.  Enraged, Tommy and Jimmy attack and kill him. Knowing their murder of a made man would mean retribution from the Gambinos, which could possibly include Paulie being ordered to kill them, Jimmy, Henry, and Tommy cover up the murder. They transport the body in the trunk of Henry's car, and bury it in upstate New York. Six months later, Jimmy learns that the burial site is slated for development, forcing them to exhume the decomposing corpse and move it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry sets up his mistress, Janice Rossi, in an apartment. When Karen finds out about their relationship, she tries to confront Janice, and then threatens Henry at gunpoint. Henry moves out to live with Janice, but Paulie directs him to return to Karen after completing a job for him. Henry and Jimmy are sent to collect a debt from a gambler in Tampa, but they are arrested after being turned in by the gambler's sister, a typist for the FBI. Jimmy and Henry receive ten-year prison sentences.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn prison, Henry sells drugs smuggled in by Karen to support his family on the outside. In 1978, Henry is paroled, and expands his cocaine trade against Paulie's orders, soon involving Jimmy and Tommy, whose behaviour becomes increasingly erratic. Jimmy organizes a crew to steal money from the Lufthansa vault at John F. Kennedy International Airport, coming away with $6 million. After a few members of the crew buy expensive items and the getaway car is found by police, Jimmy has most of the crew killed. Tommy is spared Jimmy's wrath, but is eventually killed by the Gambinos in retribution for Batts' murder, having been fooled into thinking he would become a made man.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1980, Henry has now become a nervous wreck from cocaine use and insomnia. He tries to organize a drug deal with his associates in Pittsburgh, but he is arrested by narcotics agents, and jailed. After he is bailed out, Karen explains that she flushed $60,000 worth of cocaine down the toilet to prevent FBI agents from finding it during their raid, leaving the family virtually penniless. Feeling betrayed by Henry's drug dealing, Paulie gives him $3,200, and ends their association. Facing federal charges and realizing Jimmy plans to have him killed, Henry decides to enroll in the Witness Protection Program. He gives sufficient testimony to have Paulie and Jimmy arrested and convicted. Forced out of his gangster life, Henry now has to face living in the real world. He narrates: \\"I'm an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end title cards reveal that Henry is still in the Witness Protection Program and in 1987, he was arrested in Seattle, Washington for narcotics conspiracy and he received five years probation. Since 1987, Henry has been clean. Henry and Karen Hill separated in 1989 after 25 years of marriage. Paul Cicero died in 1988 in Fort Worth Federal Prison at the age of 73 due to respiratory illness. Jimmy Conway is serving a 20 years to life sentence for murder in a New York prison and that he will not be eligible for parole until 2004 when he will be 78 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoodfellas is based on New York crime reporter Nicholas Pileggi's book Wiseguy.[5] Martin Scorsese did not intend to make another mob film until he saw a review of Pileggi's book, which he then read while working on the set of Color of Money in 1986.[6][7] He had always been fascinated by the Mob lifestyle and was drawn to Pileggi's book because it was the most honest portrayal of gangsters he had ever read.[8] After reading Pileggi's book, the filmmaker knew what approach he wanted to take: \\"To begin Goodfellas like a gunshot and have it get faster from there, almost like a two-and-a-half-hour trailer. I think it's the only way you can really sense the exhilaration of the lifestyle, and to get a sense of why a lot of people are attracted to it.\\"[9] According to Pileggi, Scorsese cold-called the writer and told him, \\"I've been waiting for this book my entire life\\", to which Pileggi replied, \\"I've been waiting for this phone call my entire life\\".[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nScorsese originally intended to direct the film before The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), but when funds materialized to make Last Temptation, he decided to postpone Wise Guy. He was drawn to the documentary aspects of Pileggi's book. \\"The book Wise Guys gives you a sense of the day-to-day life, the tedium - how they work, how they take over certain nightclubs, and for what reasons. It shows how it's done\\".[10] He saw Goodfellas as the third film in an unplanned trilogy of films that examined the lives of Italian-Americans \\"from slightly different angles\\".[12] He has often described the film as \\"a mob home movie\\" that is about money, because \\"that's what they're really in business for\\".[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nScorsese and Pileggi collaborated on the screenplay, and over the course of the 12 drafts it took to reach the ideal script, the reporter realized \\"the visual styling had to be completely redone... So we decided to share credit\\".[10][13] They decided which sections of the book they liked and put them together like building blocks.[2] Scorsese persuaded Pileggi that they did not need to follow a traditional narrative structure. The director wanted to take the gangster film and deal with it episode by episode, but start in the middle and move backwards and forwards. Scorsese would compact scenes and realized that if they were kept short, \\"the impact after about an hour and a half would be terrific\\".[2] He wanted to do the voiceover like the opening of Jules and Jim (1962) and use \\"all the basic tricks of the New Wave from around 1961\\".[2] The names of several real-life gangsters were altered for the film: Tommy \\"Two Gun\\" DeSimone became the character Tommy DeVito; Paul Vario became Paulie Cicero, and Jimmy \\"The Gent\\" Burke was portrayed as Jimmy Conway.[13] Pileggi and Scorsese decided to change the title of their film to Goodfellas because two contemporary projects, the 1986 Brian De Palma film Wise Guys and the 1987ÿ1990 TV series Wiseguy had used similar titles.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce Robert De Niro agreed to play Conway, Scorsese was able to secure the money needed to make the film.[7] The director cast Ray Liotta after De Niro saw him in Jonathan Demme's Something Wild (1986), and Scorsese was surprised by \\"his explosive energy\\" in that film.[12] Liotta had read Pileggi's book when it came out and was fascinated by it. A couple of years afterwards, his agent told him Scorsese was going to direct a film version. In 1988, he met the director over a period of a couple of months and auditioned for the film.[8] He campaigned aggressively for a role, but the studio wanted a well-known actor. He later said \\"I think they would've rather had Eddie Murphy than me\\".[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo prepare for the role, De Niro consulted with Pileggi, who had research material that had been discarded while writing the book.[15] De Niro often called Hill several times a day to ask how Burke walked, held his cigarette, and so on.[16][17] Driving to and from the set, Liotta listened to FBI audio cassette tapes of Hill, so he could practice speaking like his real-life counterpart.[17] To research her role, Lorraine Bracco tried to get close to a mob wife but was unable to, because they exist in a very tight-knit community. She decided not to meet the real Karen, saying she \\"thought it would be better if the creation came from me. I used her life with her parents as an emotional guideline for the role\\".[18] Paul Sorvino had no problem finding the voice and walk of his character, but found it challenging finding what he called \\"that kernel of coldness and absolute hardness that is antithetical to my nature except when my family is threatened\\".[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo weeks in advance of the filming, the real Henry Hill was paid $480,000.[13] The film was shot on location in Queens, New York, New Jersey, and parts of Long Island during the spring and summer of 1989, with a budget of $25 million.[13] Scorsese broke the film down into sequences and storyboarded everything because of the complicated style throughout. According to the filmmaker, he \\"wanted lots of movement and I wanted it to be throughout the whole picture, and I wanted the style to kind of break down by the end, so that by [Henry's] last day as a wiseguy, it's as if the whole picture would be out of control, give the impression he's just going to spin off the edge and fly out.\\"[6] He claims that the film's style comes from the first two or three minutes of Jules and Jim (1962): extensive narration, quick edits, freeze frames, and multiple locale switches.[9] It was this reckless attitude towards convention that mirrored the attitude of many of the gangsters in the film. Scorsese remarked, \\"So if you do the movie, you say, 'I don't care if there's too much narration. Too many quick cuts?That's too bad.' It's that kind of really punk attitude we're trying to show\\".[9] He adopted a frenetic style to almost overwhelm the audience with images and information.[2] He also put plenty of detail in every frame because the gangster life is so rich. The use of freeze frames was done because Scorsese wanted images that would stop \\"because a point was being reached\\" in Henry's life.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe Pesci didn't judge his character but found the scene where he kills Spider for talking back to his character hard to do, because he had trouble justifying the action until he forced himself to feel the way Tommy did.[8] Lorraine Bracco found the shoot to be an emotionally difficult one because it was such a male-dominated cast, and she realized if she did not make her \\"work important, it would probably end up on the cutting room floor\\".[8] When it came to the relationship between Henry and Karen, Bracco saw no difference between an abused wife and her character.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese let the actors do whatever they wanted. He made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines the actors came up with that he liked best, and put them into a revised script that the cast worked from during principal photography.[15] For example, the scene where Tommy tells a story and Henry is responding to him  the \\"Funny how? Do I amuse you?\\" scene  is based on an actual event that Pesci had witnessed. It was worked on in rehearsals where he and Liotta improvised, and Scorsese recorded four to five takes, rewrote their dialogue, and inserted it into the script.[20] The dinner scene with Tommy's mother was largely improvised. Her painting of the bearded man with the dogs was based on a photograph from National Geographic magazine.[21] The cast did not meet Henry Hill during the film's shoot until a few weeks before it premiered. Liotta met him in an undisclosed city; Hill had seen the film and told the actor that he loved it.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long tracking shot through the Copacabana nightclub came about because of a practical problem: the filmmakers could not get permission to go in the short way, and this forced them to go round the back.[2] Scorsese decided to film the sequence in one unbroken shot in order to symbolize that Henry's entire life was ahead of him, commenting, \\"It's his seduction of her [Karen] and it's also the lifestyle seducing him\\".[2] This sequence was shot eight times.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry's last day as a wiseguy was the hardest part of the film for Scorsese to shoot, because he wanted to properly show Henry's state of anxiety, paranoia, and racing thoughts caused by cocaine and amphetamines intoxication.[2] Scorsese said to movie critic Mark Cousins in an interview the reason for Pesci shooting at the screen at the end of the film: \\"well that's a reference right to the end of The Great Train Robbery, that's the way that ends, that film, and basically the plot of this picture is very similar to The Great Train Robbery. It hasn't changed, 90 years later, it's the same story, the gun shots will always be there, he's always going to look behind his back, he's gotta have eyes behind his back, because they're gonna get him someday.\\" The director ended the film with Henry regretting that he is no longer a wiseguy, about which Scorsese said, \\"I think the audience should get angry at him and I would hope they doand maybe with the system which allows this.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nScorsese wanted to depict the film's violence realistically, \\"cold, unfeeling and horrible. Almost incidental\\".[7] However, he had to remove 10 frames of blood to ensure an R rating from the MPAA.[12] With a budget of $25 million, Goodfellas was Scorsese's most expensive film to date but still only a medium budget by Hollywood standards. It was also the first time he was obliged by Warner Bros. to preview the film. It was shown twice in California, and a lot of audiences were \\"agitated\\" by Henry's last day as a wise guy sequence. Scorsese argued that that was the point of the scene.[2] Scorsese and the film's editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, made this sequence faster with more jump cuts to convey Henry's drug-addled point of view. In the first test screening there were 40 walkouts in the first ten minutes.[20] One of the favorite scenes for test audiences was the one where Tommy tells the story and Henry is responding to himthe \\"Do I amuse you?\\" scene.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nScorsese chose songs for the soundtrack that he felt obliquely commented on the scene or the characters.[12] He only used music that could have been heard at that time. For example, if a scene took place in 1973, he could use any song that was current or older. According to Scorsese, a lot of non-dialogue scenes were shot to playback. For example, he had \\"Layla\\" (1970) playing on the set while shooting the scene where the dead bodies are discovered in the car, dumpster, and meat truck. Sometimes, the lyrics of songs were put between lines of dialogue to comment on the action.[2] Some of the music Scorsese had written into the script, while other songs he discovered during the editing phase.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoodfellas premiered at the 47th Venice International Film Festival, where Scorsese received the Silver Lion award for best director.[22] It was given a wide release in North America on September 21, 1990 in 1,070 theaters with an opening weekend gross of US$6.3 million. It went on to make $46.8 million domestically.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, 96% of 88 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Hard-hitting and stylish, GoodFellas is a gangster classic ÿ and arguably the high point of Martin Scorsese's career.\\"[23] Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 89 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".[24]  On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of \\"Aÿ\\" on an A+ to F scale.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert wrote, \\"No finer film has ever been made about organized crime ÿ not even The Godfather.\\"[26] In his review for the Chicago Tribune, Gene Siskel wrote, \\"All of the performances are first-rate; Pesci stands out, though, with his seemingly unscripted manner. GoodFellas is easily one of the year's best films.\\"[27] In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote, \\"More than any earlier Scorsese film, Goodfellas is memorable for the ensemble nature of the performances... The movie has been beautifully cast from the leading roles to the bits. There is flash also in some of Mr. Scorsese's directorial choices, including freeze frames, fast cutting and the occasional long tracking shot. None of it is superfluous\\".[28] USA Today gave the film four out of four stars and called it, \\"great cinemaand also a whopping good time\\".[9] David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek magazine, wrote \\"Every crisp minute of this long, teeming movie vibrates with outlaw energy\\".[29] Rex Reed said, \\"Big, Rich, Powerful and Explosive. One of Scorsese's best films! Goodfellas is great entertainment.\\"[This quote needs a citation] In his review for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, \\"So it is Scorsese's triumph that GoodFellas offers the fastest, sharpest 2?-hr. ride in recent film history.\\"[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was ranked the best of 1990 by Roger Ebert,[31] Gene Siskel,[31] and Peter Travers.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed Goodfellas as the fifteenth best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoodfellas is 39th on James Berardinelli's 2014 list of the top 100 Films.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoodfellas was released on DVD in March 1997, in a single-disc double-sided single-layer format that requires the disc to be flipped during viewing; in 2004, Warner Home Video released a two-disc, dual-layer version, with remastered picture and sound, and bonus materials such as commentary tracks.[38]  In early 2007 the film became available on single Blu-ray with all the features from the 2004 release; an expanded Blu-ray version was released in February 2010, bundled with a disc with features that include the 2008 documentary Public Enemies: The Golden Age of the Gangster Film.[38] The film was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on December 6, 2016.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoodfellas is #94 on the American Film Institute's \\"100 Years, 100 Movies\\" list and moved up to #92 on its AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) from 2007.

Goodfellas was acknowledged as the second-best in the gangster film genre (after The Godfather).[40] In 2000, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \\"culturally significant\\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoger Ebert named Goodfellas the \\"best mob movie ever\\" and placed it among the best films of the 1990s.[41] In December 2002, a UK film critics poll in Sight and Sound ranked the film #4 on their list of the 10 Best Films of the Last 25 Years.[42] Time included Goodfellas in their list of Time's All-TIME 100 Movies.[43] Channel 4 placed Goodfellas at #10 in their 2002 poll The 100 Greatest Films. Empire listed Goodfellas at #6 on their \\"500 Greatest Movies Of All Time\\".[44] Total Film voted Goodfellas #1 as the greatest film of all time.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nPremiere listed Joe Pesci's Tommy DeVito as #96 on its list of \\"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time,\\" calling him \\"perhaps the single most irredeemable character ever put on film.\\"[46] Empire ranked Tommy DeVito #59 in their \\"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\\" poll.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoodfellas inspired director David Chase to make the HBO television series The Sopranos. Chase said \\"Goodfellas is the Koran for me.\\" He also told Peter Bogdanovich: \\"Goodfellas is a very important movie to me and Goodfellas really plowed that ... I found that movie very funny and brutal and it felt very real. And yet that was the first mob movie that Scorsese ever dealt with a mob crew. ... as opposed to say The Godfather ... which there's something operatic about it, classical, even the clothing and the cars. You know I mean I always think about Goodfellas when they go to their mother's house that night when they're eating, you know when she brings out her painting, that stuff is great. I mean The Sopranos learned a lot from that.\\"[48] Indeed, the film shares a total of 27 actors with The Sopranos,[49] including Sirico, Imperioli, Pellegrino, Lip, Vincent, and Bracco, who would later be cast in major roles in  Chase's HBO series.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 24, 2010, marked the 20th anniversary of the film's release.

This bird is mainly a permanent resident, but northern birds may move south during harsh weather. This species has rarely been observed in Europe. This species was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema Natur? in 1758 as Turdus polyglottos. The northern mockingbird is known for its mimicking ability, as reflected by the meaning of its scientific name, 'many-tongued mimic.' The northern mockingbird has gray to brown upper feathers and a paler belly. Its tail and wings have white patches which are visible in flight.[2]\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird is an omnivore. It eats both insects and fruits. It is often found in open areas and forest edges but forages in grassy land. The northern mockingbird breeds in southeastern Canada, the United States, northern Mexico, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands and the Greater Antilles. It is replaced further south by its closest living relative, the tropical mockingbird. The Socorro mockingbird, an endangered species, is also closely related, contrary to previous opinion. The northern mockingbird is listed as of Least Concern according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird is known for its intelligence. A 2009 study showed that the bird was able to recognize individual humans, particularly noting those who had previously been intruders or threats. Also birds recognize their breeding spots and return to areas in which they had greatest success in previous years. Urban birds are more likely to demonstrate this behavior. Finally, the mockingbird is influential in United States culture, being the state bird of five states, appearing in book titles, songs and lullabies, and making other appearances in popular culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSwedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus first described this species in his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Turdus polyglottos.[3] Its current genus name, Mimus is Latin for \\"mimic\\" and the specific polyglottos, is from Ancient Greek poluglottos, \\"harmonious\\", from polus, \\"many\\", and glossa, \\"tongue\\",[4] representing its outstanding ability to mimic various sounds.[5] The northern mockingbird is considered to be conspecific with the tropical mockingbird (Mimus gilvus).[6]\\r\\nThis species is categorized as the northern mockingbird as the closest living relative to M. gilvus.[7][8]\\r\\nThere are three recognized subspecies for the northern mockingbird.[9][10] There have been proposed races from the Bahamas and Haiti placed under the orpheus section.[10]\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird is a medium-sized mimid that has long legs and tail.[11] Males and females look alike.[12] Its upper parts are colored gray, while its underparts have a white or whitish-gray color.[13] It has parallel wing bars on the half of the wings connected near the white patch giving it a distinctive appearance in flight.[13] The black central rectrices and typical white lateral rectrices are also noticeable in flight.[13] The iris is usually a light green-yellow or a yellow, but there have been instances of an orange color.[9] The bill is black with a brownish black appearance at the base.[9] The juvenile appearance is marked by its streaks on its back, distinguished spots and streaks on its chest, and a gray or grayish-green iris.[9]\\r\\nNorthern mockingbirds measure from 20.5 to 28?cm (8.1 to 11.0?in) including a tail almost as long as its body. The wingspan can range from 31ÿ38?cm (12ÿ15?in) and body mass is from 40ÿ58?g (1.4ÿ2.0?oz). Males tend to be slightly larger than females.[14][15] Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 10 to 12?cm (3.9 to 4.7?in), the tail is 10 to 13.4?cm (3.9 to 5.3?in), the culmen is 1.6 to 1.9?cm (0.63 to 0.75?in) and the tarsus is 2.9 to 3.4?cm (1.1 to 1.3?in).[9]\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird's lifespan is observed to be up to 8 years, but captive birds can live up to 20 years.[16]\\r\\nThe mockingbird's breeding range is from Maritime provinces of Canada westwards to British Columbia, practically the entire Continental United States south of the northern Plains states and Pacific northwest, and the majority of Mexico to eastern Oaxaca and Veracruz.[9] The mockingbird is generally a year-round resident of its range, but the birds that live in the northern portion of its range have been noted further south during the winter season.[13] Sightings of the mockingbird have also been recorded in Hawaii (where it was introduced in the 1920s),[17] southeastern Alaska,[18] and twice as transatlantic vagrants in Britain.[13] The mockingbird is thought to be at least partly migratory in the northern portions of its range, but the migratory behavior is not well understood.[17]\\r\\nIn the nineteenth century, the range of the mockingbird expanded northward towards provinces such as Nova Scotia and Ontario and states such as Massachusetts, although the sightings were sporadic. Within the first five decades of the twentieth century, regions that received an influx of mockingbirds were Maine, Vermont, Ohio, Iowa, and New York.[17] In western states such as California, the population was restricted to the lower Sonoran regions but by the 1970s the mockingbirds was residential in most counties.[17] Islands that saw introductions of the mockingbird include Bermuda (in which it failed), Barbados, St. Helena, Socorro Island, the Cayman Islands and Tahiti.[17][19]\\r\\nThe mockingbird's habitat varies by location, but it prefers open areas with sparse vegetation. In the eastern regions, suburban and urban areas such as parks, gardens are frequent residential areas. It has an affinity for mowed lawns with shrubs within proximity for shade and nesting.[13][17] In western regions, desert scrub, chaparral are among its preferred habitats When foraging for food, it prefers short grass.[13] This bird does not nest in densely forested areas,[9][20] and generally resides in the same habitats year round.[17]\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird is an omnivore. The birds' diet consists of arthropods, earthworms, berries, fruits, seeds, and seldom, lizards.[9] Mockingbirds can drink from puddles, river and lake edges, or dew and rain droplets that amass onto plants.[13] Adult mockingbirds also have been seen drinking sap from the cuts on recently pruned trees.[13] Its diet heavily consists of animal prey during the breeding season, but takes a drastic shift to fruits during the fall and winter.[13] The drive for fruits amid winter has been noted for the geographic expansion of the mockingbird, and in particular, the fruit of Rosa multiflora, a favorite of the birds, is a possible link.[9][13] Mockingbirds also eat garden fruits such as tomatoes, apples, and berries.[21][22]\\r\\nThese birds forage on the ground or in vegetation; they also fly down from a perch to capture food.[13] While foraging, they frequently spread their wings in a peculiar two-step motion to display the white patches. There is disagreement among ornithologists over the purpose of this behavior, with hypotheses ranging from deceleration to intimidation of predators or prey.[23][24]\\r\\nBoth the male and female of the species reach sexual maturity after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer.[11] The males arrive before the beginning of the season to establish their territories. The males use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites.[11] They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings.[11] They sing and call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.[25][26]\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird pairs hatch about 2 to 4 broods a year.[11] In one breeding season, the northern mockingbird lays an average of 4 eggs. They hatch after about 11 to 14 days of incubation. After about 10 to 15 days of life, the offspring become independent.[11]\\r\\nBoth the male and female are involved in the nest building.[27] The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground.[27] The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots.[14] The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the eggs are hatched, both the male and female will feed the chicks.[27]\\r\\nThe birds aggressively defend their nests and surrounding areas against other birds and animals.[27] When a predator is persistent, mockingbirds from neighboring territories may be summoned by distinct calls to join the defense. Other birds may gather to watch as the mockingbirds harass the intruder. In addition to harassing domestic cats and dogs that they consider a threat,[11] mockingbirds will at times target humans. The birds are unafraid and will attack much larger birds, even hawks. One incident in Tulsa, Oklahoma involving a postal carrier resulted in the distribution of a warning letter to residents.[28]\\r\\nNorthern mockingbirds are famous for their song repertoires. Studies have shown that males sing songs at the beginning of breeding season to attract females.[29] Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males.[13] The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season.[30] Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary his song production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male.[29] Unmated males are also more likely to use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range.[29] Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.[25]\\r\\nAn observational study by Logan demonstrates that the female is continuously evaluating the quality of the male and his territory.[31] The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory at the beginning of a new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new males territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males.[31] The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs.[31] At the same time, both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.[13][31]\\r\\nNorthern mockingbirds adjust the sex ratio of their offspring according to the food availability and population density. Male offspring usually require more parental investment. There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier sex at the beginning of a breeding season when the food is abundant.[32] Local resource competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation. In passerine birds, like the northern mockingbird, females are more likely to disperse than males.[33] Hence, it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high and the competition for local resources is intense. Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments, it is possible that the pollution and contamination in cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in offspring sex ratio.[34]\\r\\nNorthern mockingbirds are socially monogamous. The two sexes look alike except that males are a little larger in size than females. Mutual mate choice is exhibited in northern mockingbirds.[35] Both males and females prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders, and so exhibit greater parental investment. However, males are more defensive of their nests than females. In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults, females have more freedom in choosing their mates.[35] In these cases, these female breeders have the option of changing mates within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care, which includes feeding and nest defense.[36] High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory, and so these males are preferred by females.[36]\\r\\nNorthern mockingbirds are altricial, meaning that, when hatched, they are born relatively immobile and defenseless and therefore require nourishment for a certain duration from their parents. The young have a survival bottleneck at the nestling stage because there are higher levels of nestling predation than egg predation. The levels of belligerence exhibited by parents therefore increase once eggs hatch but there is no increase during the egg stage.[35]\\r\\nA recent study shows that both food availability and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time to care for the nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.[37]\\r\\nMockingbird nests are also often parasitized by cowbirds. The parents are found to reject parasitic eggs at an intermediate rate.[38] A recent study has shown that foreign eggs are more likely to be rejected from a nest later in the breeding season than from earlier in a breeding season. Early nesting hosts may not have learned the pattern and coloration of their first clutch yet, so are less likely to reject foreign eggs. There is also a seasonal threshold in terms of the overlap between the breeding seasons of the northern mockingbirds and their parasites. If the breeding season of the parasites starts later, there is less likelihood of parasitism. Hence, it pays the hosts to have relatively lower sensitivity to parasitic eggs.[39]\\r\\nAlthough many species of bird imitate the vocalizations of other birds, the northern mockingbird is the best known in North America for doing so. Among the species and vocalizations imitated are Carolina wren, northern cardinal, tufted titmouse, eastern towhee, house sparrow, wood thrush and eastern bluebird songs, calls of the northern flicker and great crested flycatcher, jeers and pumphandles of the blue jay, and alarm, chups, and chirrs of the American robin.[40][41] It imitates not only birds, but also other animals such as cats, dogs, frogs, crickets and sounds from artificial items such as unoiled wheels and even car alarms. As convincing as these imitations may be to humans, they often fail to fool other birds, such as the Florida scrub-jay.[42]\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird's mimicry is likely to serve as a form of sexual selection through which competition between males and female choice influence a bird's song repertoire size.[42] A 2013 study attempted to determine model selection in vocal mimics, and the data suggested that mimicry in the mockingbird resulted from the bird being genetically predisposed to learning vocalizations with acoustic characteristics such as an enlarged auditory template.[40]\\r\\nBoth male and female mockingbirds sing, with the latter being generally quieter and less vocal. Male commencement of singing is in late January to February and continues into the summer and the establishing of territory into the fall. Frequency in female singing is more sporadic, as it sings less often in the summer and fall, and only sings when the male is away from the territory.[13] The mockingbird also possesses a large song repertoire that ranges from 43 to 203 song types and the size varies by region. Repertoire sizes ranged from 14 to 150 types in Texas, and two studies of mockingbirds in Florida rounded estimates to 134 and 200, approximately.[13] It continually expands its repertoire during its life,[13] though it pales in comparison to mimids such as the brown thrasher.[43]\\r\\nThere are four recognized calls for the mockingbird: the nest relief call, hew call, chat or chatburst, and the begging call.[13] The hew call is mainly used by both sexes for potential nest predators, conspecific chasing, and various interactions between mates. The differences between chats and chatbursts are frequency of use, as chats are year-round, and chatbursts occur in the fall.[13] Another difference is that chatbursts appear to be used in territorial defense in the fall, and the chats are used by either sex when disturbed.[13] The nest relief and begging calls are only used by the males.[13]\\r\\nA laboratory observation of 38 mockingbird nestlings and fledglings (thirty-five and three, respectively) recorded the behavioral development of young mockingbirds. Notable milestones included the eyes opening, soft vocalizations, begging, and preening began within the first six days of life. Variation in begging and more compact movements such as perching, fear crouching, and stretching appeared by the ninth day. Wing-flashing, bathing, flight, and leaving the nest happened within seventeen days (nest leaving occurred within 11 to 13 days). Improvements of flight, walking and self-feeding took place within forty days. Agonistic behavior increased during the juvenile stages, to the extent of one of two siblings living in the same area was likely killed by the other.[44]\\r\\nAdult mockingbirds can fall victim to birds of prey such as the great horned owl, screech owl and sharp-shinned hawk, though their tenacious behavior makes them less likely to being captured. Scrub-jays also have killed and eaten mockingbirds. Snakes rarely capture incubating females. Fledgelings have been prey to domestic cats, red-tailed hawks, and crows. Eggs and nestlings are consumed by blue jays, fish crows and American crows, red-tailed hawks, swallow-tailed kites, snakes, squirrels, and cats. Blowfly larvae and Haemoproteus have been found in Florida and Arizona populations, respectively.[17]\\r\\nWinter storms limit the expansion of mockingbirds in its range. The storms have played a role in the declining of the populations in Ohio (where it has since recovered), Michigan, Minnesota and likely in Quebec. Dry seasons also affect the mockingbird populations in Arizona.[17]\\r\\nIn a paper published in 2009, researchers found that mockingbirds were able to recall an individual human who, earlier in the study, had approached and threatened the mockingbirds' nest. Researchers had one participant stand near a mockingbird nest and touch it, while others avoided the nest. Later, the mockingbirds recognized the intruder and exhibited defensive behavior, while ignoring the other individuals.[45]\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird is a species that is found in both urban and rural habitats. There are now more northern mockingbirds living in urban habitats than non-urban environments, so they are consequently known as an urban-positive species.[46] Biologists have long questioned how northern mockingbirds adapt to a novel environment in cities, and whether they fall into the typical ecological traps that are common for urban-dwelling birds.[46] A comparative study between an urban dwelling population and a rural dwelling one shows that the apparent survival is higher for individuals in the urban habitats. Lower food availability and travel costs may account for the higher mortality rate in rural habitats.[47] Urban birds are more likely to return to the nest where they had successfully bred the previous year and avoid those where breeding success was low. One explanation for this phenomenon is that urban environments are more predictable than non-urban ones, as the site fidelity among urban birds prevents them from ecological traps.[47] Mockingbirds are also able to utilize artificial lighting in order to feed nestlings in urban areas such as residential neighborhoods into the night in contrast to those that do not nest near those areas.[48] The adaptation of mockingbirds in urban habitats has led it to become more susceptible to lead poisoning in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. populations.[17]\\r\\nIt also features in the title and central metaphor of the novel To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee. In that novel, mockingbirds are portrayed as innocent and generous, and two of the major characters, Atticus Finch and Miss Maudie, say it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because \\"they don't do one thing for us but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.\\"[49]\\r\\n\\"Hush, Little Baby\\" is a traditional lullaby, thought to have been written in the Southern United States, its key first lines, \\"Hush, little baby, don't say a word, Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird. And if that mockingbird don't sing, Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring.\\"\\r\\nThe song of the northern mockingbird inspired many classic American folk songs of the mid-19th century, such as \\"Listen to the Mocking Bird\\".[50]\\r\\nMockin' Bird Hill is a popular song best known through recordings by Patti Page, Donna Fargo, and by Les Paul and Mary Ford in 1951.\\r\\nThomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, had a pet mockingbird named \\"Dick\\".[51][52]\\r\\nIn the fictional Neighborhood of Make-Believe on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, one of King Friday's \\"pets\\" is a wooden Northern mockingbird on a stick, which he refers to by the scientific name Mimus polyglottos.[53][54]\\r\\nIn the fictional world of the novel The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, mockingjays are black and white birds created accidentally by the mating of engineered jabberjays with female mockingbirds, after rebels discovered and defeated the jabberjays' purpose. The mockingjay can perfectly copy the melody of human singing in a whistling tone. District 11 is known to have an especially large mockingjay population, and they are used there to signal the end of the work day.[55]\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird is the state bird of Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas,[56] and formerly the state bird of South Carolina.","input":"How long do mocking birds stay in the nest?"},{"output":"from 1955 to 1958","context":"Fred Newman (1989 revival, seasons 1-6)\\r\\nThe Mickey Mouse Club is an American variety television show that aired intermittently from 1955 to 1996 and returned in 2017 to social media. Created by Walt Disney and produced by Walt Disney Productions, the program was first televised for three seasons, from 1955 to 1958, by ABC. This original run featured a regular but ever-changing cast of mostly teen performers. ABC broadcast reruns weekday afternoons during the 1958ÿ1959 season, airing right after American Bandstand. The show was revived after its initial 1955ÿ1959 run on ABC, first from 1977ÿ1979 for first-run syndication, again from 1989ÿ1996 as The All-New Mickey Mouse Club (also known to fans as MMC from 1993ÿ1996) airing exclusively on cable television's The Disney Channel, then rebooted in 2017 with the moniker Club Mickey Mouse airing exclusively on internet social media.\\r\\nMickey Mouse himself appeared in every show not only in vintage cartoons originally made for theatrical release but in opening, interstitial, and closing segments made especially for the show. In both the vintage cartoons and new animated segments, Mickey was voiced by his creator Walt Disney. (Disney had previously voiced the character theatrically from 1928 to 1947 before being replaced by sound effects artist Jimmy MacDonald.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first official theater-based Mickey Mouse Club began on January 11, 1930 at the Fox Dome Theater in Ocean Park, California, with sixty theaters hosting clubs by March 31. The Club released its first issue of the Official Bulletin of the Mickey Mouse Club on April 15, 1930.[1] By 1932, the Club had 1 million members, and in 1933 its first British club opened at Darlingtons Arcade Cinema.[2][3] In 1935, Disney began to phase out the club.[4]\\r\\nThe Mickey Mouse Club was hosted by Jimmie Dodd, a songwriter and the Head Mouseketeer, who provided leadership both on and off screen. In addition to his other contributions, he often provided short segments encouraging young viewers to make the right moral choices. These little homilies became known as \\"Doddisms\\".[5] Roy Williams, a staff artist at Disney, also appeared in the show as the Big Mouseketeer. Roy suggested the Mickey and Minnie Mouse ears worn by the cast members, which he helped create, along with Chuck Keehne, Hal Adelquist, and Bill Walsh.\\r\\nThe main cast members were called Mouseketeers, and they performed in a variety of musical and dance numbers, as well as some informational segments. The most popular of the Mouseketeers comprised the so-called Red Team, who were kept under contract for the entire run of the show (1955-1959), consisted of the following:\\r\\nOther Mouseketeers that were Red Team members but not on the show for all three seasons included the following:\\r\\nThe remaining Mouseketeers, consisting of the White or Blue Teams, were Don Agrati (later known as Don Grady when starring as \\"Robbie\\" on the long-running sitcom My Three Sons), Sherry Alberoni, Billie Jean Beanblossom, Eileen Diamond, Dickie Dodd (not related to Jimmie Dodd), Mary Espinosa, Bonnie Lynn Fields,[7] Judy Harriet, Linda Hughes, Dallas Johann, John Lee Johann, Bonni Lou Kern, Charlie Laney, Larry Larsen, Paul Petersen, Lynn Ready, Mickey Rooney Jr., Tim Rooney, Mary Sartori, Bronson Scott, Margene Storey, Ronnie Steiner, and Mark Sutherland.[8] Larry Larsen, on only for the 1956ÿ57 season, was the oldest Mouseketeer, being born in 1939, and Bronson Scott, on only the 1955-56 season, was the youngest Mouseketeer, being born in July 1947. Among the thousands who auditioned but didn't make the cut were future vocalist/songwriter Paul Williams and future actress Candice Bergen.\\r\\nThe 39 Mouseketeers and the seasons they were featured in (with the team color they belonged to listed for each season):\\r\\nOther notable non-Mouseketeer performers appeared in various dramatic segments:[5]\\r\\nThese non-Mouseketeers primarily appeared in numerous original serials filmed for the series, only some of which have appeared in reruns. Certain Mouseketeers were also featured in some of the serials, particularly Annette Funicello and Darlene Gillespie.\\r\\nMajor serials included the following:[5]\\r\\n\\"Border Collie\\"\\r\\nThe opening theme, \\"The Mickey Mouse March,\\" was written by the show's primary adult host, Jimmie Dodd.[5] It was also reprised at the end of each episode, with the slower it's-time-to-say-goodbye verse. A shorter version of the opening title was used later in the series, in syndication, and on Disney Channel reruns. Dodd also wrote many other songs used in individual segments over the course of the series.\\r\\nEach day of the week had a special show theme, which was reflected in the various segments. The themes were:\\r\\nThe series ran on ABC Television for an hour each weekday in the 1955ÿ1956 and 1956ÿ1957 seasons (from 5:00 to 6:00?pm ET), and only a half-hour weekdays (5:30 to 6:00?p.m. ET) in 1957ÿ1958, the final season to feature new programming.[9] Although the show returned for the 1958ÿ1959 season (5:30 to 6:00?p.m. ET), these programs were repeats from the first two seasons, re-cut into a half-hour format. The Mickey Mouse Club was featured on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and Walt Disney's Adventure Time, featuring re-runs of The Mickey Mouse Club serials and several re-edited segments from Disneyland and Walt Disney Presents, appeared on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\\r\\nAlthough the show remained popular, ABC decided to cancel the show after its fourth season, as Disney and the ABC network could not come to terms for renewal.[10] The cancellation in September 1959 was attributable to several factors: the Disney studios did not realize high-profit margins from merchandise sales, the sponsors were uninterested in educational programming for children, and many commercials were needed in order to pay for the show. After canceling The Mickey Mouse Club, ABC also refused to let Disney air the show on another network.[11] Walt Disney filed a lawsuit against ABC, and won the damages in a settlement; however, he had to agree that both the Mickey Mouse Club and Zorro could not be aired on any major network. This left Walt Disney Presents (initially titled Disneyland, later retitled the Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color when it moved to NBC) as the only Disney series left on prime time until 1972 when The Mouse Factory went on the air. The prohibition against major U.S. broadcast network play of the original Mickey Mouse Club (or any later version) became moot when Disney acquired ABC in 1996, but no plans have been announced for an ABC airing of any version of The Mickey Mouse Club produced between 1955 and 1996 or for a new network series.\\r\\nAlthough the series had been discontinued in the United States, many members of the cast assembled for highly successful tours of Australia in 1959 and 1960. The television series was very successful in Australia and was still running on Australian television. The cast surprised Australian audiences, as by then they had physically matured and in some cases, bore little resemblance to the young cast with whom Australians were so familiar. Mainstream television did not reach Australia until 1956 so the series screened well into the 1960s when the back catalogue expired.\\r\\nIn response to continuing audience demand, the original Mickey Mouse Club went into edited syndicated half-hour reruns that enjoyed wide distribution starting in the fall of 1962, achieving strong ratings especially during its first three seasons in syndicated release. (because of its popularity in some markets, a few stations continued to carry it into 1968 before the series was finally withdrawn from syndication). Some new features were added such as Fun with Science, aka \\"Professor Wonderful\\" (with scientist Julius Sumner Miller) and Marvelous Marvin in the 1964ÿ1965 season; Jimmie Dodd appeared in several of these new segments before his death in November 1964. Many markets stretched the program back to an hour's daily run time during the 1960s rerun cycle by adding locally produced and hosted portions involving educational subjects and live audience participation of local children, in a manner not unlike Romper Room.\\r\\nIn response to an upsurge in demand from baby boomers entering adulthood, the show again went into syndicated reruns from January 20, 1975, until January 14, 1977. It has since been rerun on cable specialty channels Disney in the U.S. and Family in Canada. The original Mickey Mouse Club films aired five days a week on The Disney Channel from its launch in 1983 until the third version of the series began in 1989. The last airing of the edited 1950s material was on Disney Channel's Vault Disney from 1997 to September 2002. During the baseball seasons in 1975 and 1976, WGN-TV in Chicago, Illinois aired the MMC on a delayed basis due to Cubs ballgame coverages.\\r\\nAnnette Funicello and Tim Considine were reunited on The New Mickey Mouse Club in 1977. Darlene Gillespie and Cubby O'Brien were also reunited on another episode of the same series.\\r\\n31 of the 39 original Mouseketeers were reunited for a TV special, which aired on Disney's Wonderful World in November 1980.\\r\\nCast members Annette Funicello, Bobby Burgess, Tommy Cole, Sharon Baird, Don Grady, and Sherry Alberoni were reunited on the 100th episode of The All-New Mickey Mouse Club, during the show's third season in 1991.\\r\\nMouseketeers Doreen Tracey, Cubby O'Brien, Sherry Alberoni, Sharon Baird, Don Grady, Cheryl Holdridge, Bobby Burgess, Karen Pendleton, Tommy Cole, and Mary Espinosa performed together at Disneyland in the fall of 2005, in observance of Disneyland's 50th birthday, and the 50th anniversary of the TV premiere of The Mickey Mouse Club.\\r\\nIn the 1977 Walt Disney Productions revived the concept, but modernized the show cosmetically, with a disco re-recording of the theme song and a more ethnically diverse group of young cast members. The sets were brightly colored and simpler than the detailed black and white artwork of the original. Like the original, nearly each day's episode included a vintage cartoon, though usually in color from the late 1930s and onward. The 1977 Mouseketeers were part of the halftime show of Super Bowl XI on January 9, 1977.\\r\\nSerials were usually old Disney movies, cut into segments for twice-weekly inclusion. Movies included Third Man on the Mountain, The Misadventures of Merlin Jones and its sequel The Monkey's Uncle (both starring Tommy Kirk), Emil and the Detectives (retitled The Three Skrinks), Tonka (retitled A Horse Called Comanche), The Horse Without a Head (about a toy horse), and Toby Tyler (starring Kevin Corcoran). In addition, one original serial was produced, The Mystery of Rustler's Cave, starring Kim Richards and Robbie Rist.\\r\\nTheme days were:\\r\\nThe series debuted on January 17, 1977, on 38 local television stations in the United States, and by June of that same year, when the series was discontinued, about 70 stations in total had picked up the series. Additional stations picked up the canceled program, which continued to run until January 12, 1979; 130 new episodes, with much of the original material repackaged and a bit of new footage added, and a shortened version of the theme song, were produced to start airing September 5, 1977. Since the 1970s, the series has aired only briefly in reruns, unlike its 1950s predecessor, and while both the 1950s and 1989/1990s series had DVD releases of select episodes in July 2005, the 1970s series has been largely forgotten including the generation of youthful viewers. On November 20, 1977, \\"The Mouseketeers at Walt Disney World\\" was shown on The Wonderful World of Disney. WGN-TV in Chicago, Illinois also aired this version on a delayed basis in 1977 and 1978 during the Cubs baseball season due to game coverages.\\r\\nThe cast of twelve (5 boys and 7 girls) had a more diverse ethnic background than the 1950s version. Several 1977ÿ1978 cast members went on to become TV stars and other notable icons.\\r\\nThe show's most notable alumna was Lisa Whelchel (born in 1963, in Littlefield, Texas), who later starred in the NBC television sitcom The Facts of Life before becoming a well-known Christian author and, most recently, overall runner-up, and winner of the $100,000 viewers' choice award, on the fall 2012 season of the CBS television reality series Survivor. Mouseketeer Julie Piekarski (born St. Louis, 1963) also appeared with Lisa Whelchel on the first season of The Facts of Life. Kelly Parsons (born Coral Gables, Fla., 1964) went on to become a beauty queen and runner-up to Miss USA.\\r\\nOther Mouseketeers (from seasons 1ÿ2 (1977)) from the 1977 show:[8]\\r\\nDisney voice actor and sound effects editor Wayne Allwine voiced Mickey Mouse in the animated lead-ins for the show, replacing Jimmy MacDonald, who in 1947 had replaced Walt Disney as the voice of Mickey for theatrical cartoons. Walt Disney had been the original voice of Mickey and for the original 19541959 run provided the voice for animated introductions to the original TV show but had died in 1966. Allwine would keep providing the voice for the character up to his death in 2009.\\r\\nFuture rock musician Courtney Love claims to have auditioned for a part on the show, reading a poem by Sylvia Plath; she was not selected.[12]\\r\\nFormer Mouseketeer Annette Funicello and Mouseketeer serial star Tim Considine guest starred in one episode; Former Mouseketeers Darlene Gillespie and Cubby O'Brien were also reunited on a different episode.\\r\\nThe lyrics of the \\"Mickey Mouse Club March\\" theme song were slightly different from the original, with two additional lines: \\"He's our favorite Mouseketeer; we know you will agree\\" and \\"Take some fun and mix in love, our happy recipe.\\"\\r\\nA soundtrack album[13] was released with the show.\\r\\nA new rendition of the \\"Mickey Mouse Club March\\" was made later on in 1999 by Mannheim Steamroller, a contemporary band, in hopes of connecting new-age children and their parents who watched the Mickey Mouse Club.\\r\\nThis incarnation was not distributed by Disney alone; while Disney did produce the series, it was co-produced and distributed by SFM Entertainment, which also handled 1970s-era syndication of the original 1950s series (Disney since regained sole distribution rights).\\r\\nReruns of the original The Mickey Mouse Club began airing on The Disney Channel with the channel's 1983 launch. While the show was popular with younger audiences, The Disney Channel executives felt it had become dated over the years, particularly as it was aired in black-and-white. Their answer was to create a brand-new version of the Club, one geared toward contemporary audiences. Notably, the all-new \\"club-members\\" would wear high-school like Mouseketeer jackets without the iconic Mickey Mouse ears. This show was called The All-New Mickey Mouse Club (also known as \\"MMC\\" to fans).\\r\\nThis version of the series is notable for featuring a number of cast members who went on to international success in music and acting, including Tony Lucca, Chasen Hampton, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Rhona Bennett, Nikki DeLoach, Keri Russell, and Ryan Gosling.\\r\\nThis was the first version of the club to have any studio audience, though a fairly small group.\\r\\nFormer Mouseketeer Don Grady guest-starred on an episode during the show's first season. Grady, along with fellow Mouseketeers Annette Funicello, Bobby Burgess, Tommy Cole, Sharon Baird, and Sherry Alberoni were reunited on the 100th episode, during the show's third season. Funicello would later appear on the show again, in an interview with the Mouseketeer Lindsey Alley.\\r\\nFrom the first through fifth seasons, the series aired Monday through Friday at 5:30pm. Through Season 6, the show aired Monday to Thursday. In its final season, Season 7, it aired Thursdays only at 7:00pm (later moved a half hour later, to 7:30pm). The series premiered Monday, April 24, 1989, ended production in October 1994, and aired its last original episode in 1996. Seasons 3 and 5 had the most episodes (55, each season). Seasons 4 and 6 were shorter, having about 35 episodes each. The remaining seasons were a standard 45 episodes (44 in Season 7) each.\\r\\nThe show was known for its sketch comedy. Some of the sketches played off well-known movies, musicals, and even cartoons, as well as holiday-related skits. During the final season, some of the skits showed everyday occurrences experienced by teens, often teaching viewers a lesson on how to handle real-life situations.\\r\\nThe series featured music videos of the Mouseketeers singing their versions of popular songs in front of a live studio audience or in the Walt Disney World Resort. This became one of the most popular segments.\\r\\nA unique feature of the show was the Mouseketeers performing concerts on certain days (which were usually taped the day before or in the summer, when the kids had more time). During the final season, the concerts were replaced primarily by live performances that featured singing and dancing in front of the audience.\\r\\nThis version maintained the \\"theme day\\" format from the previous two versions. When Disney decided to revamp the show for its final season, the show was reduced to a single weekly airing, shown only on Thursdays. Although still produced as a daily series during the final season taping in 1994, The Disney Channel, after cancelling the series once Season 7 production had concluded, decided to air the final season in a weekly format, therefore stretching the first run episodes into early 1996.

Other church fathers such as Augustine also developed the doctrine,[2] seeing it as based on the New Testament teaching of Paul the Apostle (Romans 5:12ÿ21 and 1 Corinthians 15:22) and the Old Testament verse of Psalms 51:5.[4][5][6][7][8] Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose and Ambrosiaster considered that humanity shares in Adam's sin, transmitted by human generation. Augustine's formulation of original sin was popular among Protestant reformers, such as Martin Luther and John Calvin, who equated original sin with concupiscence (or \\"hurtful desire\\"), affirming that it persisted even after baptism and completely destroyed freedom.[2] The Jansenist movement, which the Catholic Church declared to be heretical, also maintained that original sin destroyed freedom of will.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctrine of ancestral fault (? ??϶ϫ progonikon hamartema), i.e. the sins of the forefathers leading to punishment of their descendants, was presented as a tradition of immemorial antiquity in ancient Greek religion by Celsus in his True Doctrine, a polemic attacking Christianity. Celsus is quoted as attributing to \\"a priest of Apollo or of Zeus\\" the saying that \\"the mills of the gods grind slowly, even to children's children, and to those who are born after them\\".[10] The idea of divine justice taking the form of collective punishment is also ubiquitous in the Hebrew Bible.[11]\\r\\nSt Paul's idea of redemption hinged upon the contrast between the sin of Adam and the death and resurrection of Jesus. \\"Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned.\\"[12] \\"For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.\\"[13] Up till then the transgression in the Garden of Eden had not been given great significance. As the Jesus scholar, Geza Vermes has said:\\r\\nPaul believed that Adam's transgression in a mysterious way affected the nature of the human race. The primeval sin, a Pauline creation with no biblical or post-biblical Jewish precedent, was irreparable by ordinary human effort.[14]\\r\\nThe formalized Christian doctrine of original sin was first developed in the 2nd century by Irenaeus, the Bishop of Lyon, in his struggle against Gnosticism.[2] Irenaeus contrasted their doctrine with the view that the Fall was a step in the wrong direction by Adam, with whom, Irenaeus believed, his descendants had some solidarity or identity.[15] Irenaeus believed that Adam's sin had grave consequences for humanity, that it is the source of human sinfulness, mortality and enslavement to sin, and that all human beings participate in his sin and share his guilt.[16]\\r\\nThe Greek Fathers emphasized the cosmic dimension of the Fall, namely that since Adam human beings are born into a fallen world, but held fast to belief that man, though fallen, is free.[2] They thus did not teach that human beings are deprived of free will and involved in total depravity, which is one understanding of original sin.[17][18] During this period the doctrines of human depravity and the inherently sinful nature of human flesh were taught by Gnostics, and orthodox Christian writers took great pains to counter them.[19][20] Christian apologists insisted that God's future judgment of humanity implied humanity must have the ability to live righteously.[21][22]\\r\\nHistorian Robin Lane Fox argues that the foundation of the doctrine of original sin as accepted by the Church was ultimately based on a mistranslation of Paul the Apostle's Epistle to the Romans (Romans 5:12ÿ21) by Augustine, in his On the Grace of Christ, and on Original Sin\\".[23]\\r\\nAugustine of Hippo (354ÿ430) taught that Adam's sin[24] is transmitted by concupiscence, or \\"hurtful desire\\",[25][26] resulting in humanity becoming a massa damnata (mass of perdition, condemned crowd), with much enfeebled, though not destroyed, freedom of will.[2] When Adam sinned, human nature was thenceforth transformed. Adam and Eve, via sexual reproduction, recreated human nature. Their descendants now live in sin, in the form of concupiscence, a term Augustine used in a metaphysical, not a psychological sense.[27] Augustine insisted that concupiscence was not a being but a bad quality, the privation of good or a wound.[28] He admitted that sexual concupiscence (libido) might have been present in the perfect human nature in paradise, and that only later it became disobedient to human will as a result of the first couple's disobedience to God's will in the original sin.[29] In Augustine's view (termed \\"Realism\\"), all of humanity was really present in Adam when he sinned, and therefore all have sinned. Original sin, according to Augustine, consists of the guilt of Adam which all humans inherit. As sinners, humans are utterly depraved in nature, lack the freedom to do good, and cannot respond to the will of God without divine grace. Justo Gonzalez interprets Augustine's teaching that grace is irresistible, results in conversion, and leads to perseverance.[30]\\r\\nAugustine articulated his explanation in reaction to Pelagianism, which insisted that humans have of themselves, without the necessary help of God's grace, the ability to lead a morally good life, and thus denied both the importance of baptism and the teaching that God is the giver of all that is good. Pelagius claimed that the influence of Adam on other humans was merely that of bad example. Augustine held that the effects of Adam's sin are transmitted to his descendants not by example but by the very fact of generation from that ancestor. A wounded nature comes to the soul and body of the new person from his/her parents, who experience libido (or concupiscence). Augustine's view was that human procreation was the way the transmission was being effected. He did not blame, however, the sexual passion itself, but the spiritual concupiscence present in human nature, soul and body, even after baptismal regeneration.[31] Christian parents transmit their wounded nature to children, because they give them birth, not the \\"re-birth\\".[32] Augustine used Ciceronian Stoic concept of passions, to interpret St. Paul's doctrine of universal sin and redemption. In that view, also sexual desire itself as well as other bodily passions were consequence of the original sin, in which pure affections were wounded by vice and became disobedient to human reason and will. As long as they carry a threat to the dominion of reason over the soul they constitute moral evil, but since they do not presuppose consent, one cannot call them sins. Humanity will be liberated from passions, and pure affections will be restored only when all sin has been washed away and ended, that is in the resurrection of the dead.[33][34]\\r\\nAugustine believed that the only definitive destinations of souls are heaven and hell. He concluded that unbaptized infants go to hell as a consequence of original sin.[35][36] The Latin Church Fathers who followed Augustine adopted his position, which became a point of reference for Latin theologians in the Middle Ages.[37] In the later medieval period, some theologians continued to hold Augustine's view, others held that unbaptized infants suffered no pain at all: unaware of being deprived of the beatific vision, they enjoyed a state of natural, not supernatural happiness. Starting around 1300, unbaptized infants were often said to inhabit the \\"limbo of infants\\".[38] The Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1261 declares: \\"As regards children who have died without Baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as she does in her funeral rites for them. Indeed, the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved, and Jesus' tenderness toward children which caused him to say: 'Let the children come to me, do not hinder them',[39] allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have died without Baptism. All the more urgent is the Church's call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism.\\" But the theory of Limbo, while it \\"never entered into the dogmatic definitions of the Magisterium ... remains ... a possible theological hypothesis\\".[40]\\r\\nIn the works of John Cassian (c. 360 ÿ 435), Conference XIII recounts how the wise monk Chaeremon, of whom he is writing, responded to puzzlement caused by his own statement that \\"man even though he strive with all his might for a good result, yet cannot become master of what is good unless he has acquired it simply by the gift of Divine bounty and not by the efforts of his own toil\\" (chapter 1). In chapter 11, Cassian presents Chaeremon as speaking of the cases of Paul the persecutor and Matthew the publican as difficulties for those who say \\"the beginning of free will is in our own power\\", and the cases of Zaccheus and the good thief on the cross as difficulties for those who say \\"the beginning of our free will is always due to the inspiration of the grace of God\\", and as concluding: \\"These two then; viz., the grace of God and free will seem opposed to each other, but really are in harmony, and we gather from the system of goodness that we ought to have both alike, lest if we withdraw one of them from man, we may seem to have broken the rule of the Church's faith: for when God sees us inclined to will what is good, He meets, guides, and strengthens us: for 'At the voice of thy cry, as soon as He shall hear, He will answer thee'; and: 'Call upon Me', He says, 'in the day of tribulation and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me'. And again, if He finds that we are unwilling or have grown cold, He stirs our hearts with salutary exhortations, by which a good will is either renewed or formed in us.\\"[41]\\r\\nCassian did not accept the idea of total depravity, on which Martin Luther was to insist.[42] He taught that human nature is fallen or depraved, but not totally. Augustine Casiday states that, at the same time, Cassian \\"baldly asserts that God's grace, not human free will, is responsible for 'everything which pertains to salvation' ÿ even faith\\".[43] Cassian pointed out that people still have moral freedom and one has the option to choose to follow God. Colm Luibhid says that, according to Cassian, there are cases where the soul makes the first little turn,[44] but in Cassian's view, according to Casiday, any sparks of goodwill that may exist, not directly caused by God, are totally inadequate and only direct divine intervention ensures spiritual progress;[45] and Lauren Pristas says that \\"for Cassian, salvation is, from beginning to end, the effect of God's grace\\".[46]\\r\\nOpposition to Augustine's ideas about original sin, which he had developed in reaction to Pelagianism, arose rapidly.[47] After a long and bitter struggle the general principles of Augustine's teaching were confirmed within Western Christianity by many councils, especially the Second Council of Orange in 529.[2] However, while the Church condemned Pelagius, it did not endorse Augustine entirely[48] and, while Augustine's authority was accepted, he was interpreted in the light of writers such as Cassian.[49] Some of the followers of Augustine identified original sin with concupiscence[50] in the psychological sense, but this identification was challenged by the 11th-century Saint Anselm of Canterbury, who defined original sin as \\"privation of the righteousness that every man ought to possess\\", thus separating it from concupiscence. In the 12th century the identification of original sin with concupiscence was supported by Peter Lombard and others,[citation needed] but was rejected by the leading theologians in the next century, chief of whom was Thomas Aquinas. He distinguished the supernatural gifts of Adam before the Fall from what was merely natural, and said that it was the former that were lost, privileges that enabled man to keep his inferior powers in submission to reason and directed to his supernatural end. Even after the fall, man thus kept his natural abilities of reason, will and passions. Rigorous Augustine-inspired views persisted among the Franciscans, though the most prominent Franciscan theologians, such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham, eliminated the element of concupiscence.\\r\\nMartin Luther (1483ÿ1546) asserted that humans inherit Adamic guilt and are in a state of sin from the moment of conception. The second article in Lutheranism's Augsburg Confession presents its doctrine of original sin in summary form:\\r\\nIt is also taught among us that since the fall of Adam all men who are born according to the course of nature are conceived and born in sin. That is, all men are full of evil lust and inclinations from their mothers' wombs and are unable by nature to have true fear of God and true faith in God. Moreover, this inborn sickness and hereditary sin is truly sin and condemns to the eternal wrath of God all those who are not born again through Baptism and the Holy Spirit. Rejected in this connection are the Pelagians and others who deny that original sin is sin, for they hold that natural man is made righteous by his own powers, thus disparaging the sufferings and merit of Christ.[51]\\r\\nLuther, however, also agreed with the Roman Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception (that Mary was conceived free from original sin) by saying:\\r\\n[Mary] is full of grace, proclaimed to be entirely without sin. God's grace fills her with everything good and makes her devoid of all evil. God is with her, meaning that all she did or left undone is divine and the action of God in her. Moreover, God guarded and protected her from all that might be hurtful to her.[52]\\r\\nProtestant Reformer John Calvin (1509ÿ1564) developed a systematic theology of Augustinian Protestantism by interpretation of Augustine of Hippo's notion of original sin. Calvin believed that humans inherit Adamic guilt and are in a state of sin from the moment of conception. This inherently sinful nature (the basis for the Calvinistic doctrine of \\"total depravity\\") results in a complete alienation from God and the total inability of humans to achieve reconciliation with God based on their own abilities. Not only do individuals inherit a sinful nature due to Adam's fall, but since he was the federal head and representative of the human race, all whom he represented inherit the guilt of his sin by imputation. Redemption by Jesus Christ is the only remedy.\\r\\nJohn Calvin defined original sin in his Institutes of the Christian Religion as follows:\\r\\nOriginal sin, therefore, seems to be a hereditary depravity and corruption of our nature, diffused into all parts of the soul, which first makes us liable to God's wrath, then also brings forth in us those works which Scripture calls \\"works of the flesh\\" (Gal 5:19). And that is properly what Paul often calls sin. The works that come forth from it ÿ such as adulteries, fornications, thefts, hatreds, murders, carousings ÿ he accordingly calls \\"fruits of sin\\" (Gal 5:19ÿ21), although they are also commonly called \\"sins\\" in Scripture, and even by Paul himself.[53]\\r\\nThe Council of Trent (1545ÿ1563), while not pronouncing on points disputed among Catholic theologians, condemned the teaching that in baptism the whole of what belongs to the essence of sin is not taken away, but is only cancelled or not imputed, and declared the concupiscence that remains after baptism not truly and properly \\"sin\\" in the baptized, but only to be called sin in the sense that it is of sin and inclines to sin.[54]\\r\\nIn 1567, soon after the close of the Council of Trent, Pope Pius V went beyond Trent by sanctioning Aquinas's distinction between nature and supernature in Adam's state before the Fall, condemned the identification of original sin with concupiscence, and approved the view that the unbaptized could have right use of will.[2]\\r\\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church says:\\r\\nBy his sin Adam, as the first man, lost the original holiness and justice he had received from God, not only for himself but for all humans.\\r\\nAdam and Eve transmitted to their descendants human nature wounded by their own first sin and hence deprived of original holiness and justice; this deprivation is called \\"original sin\\".\\r\\nAs a result of original sin, human nature is weakened in its powers, subject to ignorance, suffering and the domination of death, and inclined to sin (this inclination is called \\"concupiscence\\").[55]\\r\\nThe Catholic Church teaches that every human person born on this earth is made in the image of God.[56][57] Within man \\"is both the powerful surge toward the good because we are made in the image of God, and the darker impulses toward evil because of the effects of Original Sin\\".[58] Furthermore, it explicitly denies that we inherit guilt from anyone, maintaining that instead we inherit our fallen nature. In this it differs from the Calvinist/Protestant position that each person actually inherits Adam's guilt, and teaches instead that \\"original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants ... but the consequences for nature, weakened and inclined to evil, persist in man\\".[59] \\"In other words, human beings do not bear any 'original guilt' from Adam and Eve's particular sin.\\"[60]\\r\\nThe Church has always held baptism to be \\"for the remission of sins\\", and, as mentioned in Catechism of the Catholic Church, 403, infants too have traditionally been baptized, though not guilty of any actual personal sin. The sin that through baptism was remitted for them could only be original sin, with which they were connected by the very fact of being a human. The first comprehensive theological explanation of this practice of baptizing infants, guilty of no actual personal sin, was given by Saint Augustine of Hippo, not all of whose ideas on original sin have been adopted by the Catholic Church. Indeed, the Church has condemned the interpretation of some of his ideas by certain leaders of the Protestant Reformation.\\r\\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church explains that in \\"yielding to the tempter, Adam and Eve committed a personal sin, but this sin affected the human nature that they would then transmit in a fallen state ... original sin is called \\"sin\\" only in an analogical sense: it is a sin \\"contracted\\" and not \\"committed\\"a state and not an act\\" (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 404). This \\"state of deprivation of the original holiness and justice ... transmitted to the descendants of Adam along with human nature\\" (Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 76) involves no personal responsibility or personal guilt on their part (cf. Catechism of the Catholic Church, 405). Personal responsibility and guilt were Adam's, who because of his sin, was unable to pass on to his descendants a human nature with the holiness with which it would otherwise have been endowed, in this way implicating them in his sin. The doctrine of original sin thus does not impute the sin of the father to his children, but merely states that they inherit from him a \\"human nature deprived of original holiness and justice\\", which is \\"transmitted by propagation to all mankind\\".[61]\\r\\nIn the theology of the Catholic Church, original sin is regarded as the general condition of sinfulness, that is the absence of holiness and perfect charity into which humans are born, distinct from the actual sins that a person commits. This teaching explicitly states that \\"original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants\\".[59] In other words, human beings do not bear any \\"original guilt\\" from Adam's particular sin, which is his alone. The prevailing view, also held in Eastern Orthodoxy, is that human beings bear no guilt for the sin of Adam. The Catholic Church teaches: \\"By our first parents' sin, the devil has acquired a certain domination over man, even though man remains free.\\"[62]\\r\\nThe Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of Mary is that Mary was conceived free from original sin: \\"the most Blessed Virgin Mary was, from the first moment of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege of almighty God and by virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, Savior of the human race, preserved immune from all stain of original sin\\".[63] The doctrine sees her as an exception to the general rule that human beings are not immune from the reality of original sin.\\r\\nSoon after the Second Vatican Council, biblical theologian Herbert Haag raised the question: Is original sin in Scripture?[64] According to his exegesis, Genesis 2:25 indicates that Adam and Eve were created from the beginning naked of the divine grace, an originary grace that, then, they would never have had and even less would have lost due to the subsequent events narrated. On the other hand, while supporting a continuity in the Bible about the absence of preternatural gifts (Latin: dona praeternaturalia)[65] with regard to the ophitic event, Haag never makes any reference to the discontinuity of the loss of access to the tree of life.\\r\\nThe Eastern Orthodox version of original sin is the view that sin originates with the Devil, \\"for the devil sinneth from the beginning (1 John iii. 8)\\".[66] They acknowledge that the introduction of ancestral sin[67][better?source?needed] into the human race affected the subsequent environment for humanity (see also traducianism). However, they never accepted Augustine of Hippo's notions of original sin and hereditary guilt.[68][better?source?needed]\\r\\nOrthodox Churches accept the teachings of John Cassian, as do Catholic Churches eastern and western,[42] in rejecting the doctrine of total depravity, by teaching that human nature is \\"fallen\\", that is, depraved, but not totally. Augustine Casiday states that Cassian \\"baldly asserts that God's grace, not human free will, is responsible for 'everything which pertains to salvation' ÿ even faith\\".[43] Cassian points out that people still have moral freedom and one has the option to choose to follow God. Colm Luibhid says that, according to Cassian, there are cases where the soul makes the first little turn,[44] while Augustine Casiday says that, in Cassian's view, any sparks of goodwill that may exist, not directly caused by God, are totally inadequate and only direct divine intervention ensures spiritual progress.[45] and Lauren Pristas says that \\"for Cassian, salvation is, from beginning to end, the effect of God's grace\\".[46]\\r\\nEastern Orthodoxy accepts the doctrine of ancestral sin: \\"Original sin is hereditary. It did not remain only Adam and Eve's. As life passes from them to all of their descendants, so does original sin.\\"[69] \\"As from an infected source there naturally flows an infected stream, so from a father infected with sin, and consequently mortal, there naturally proceeds a posterity infected like him with sin, and like him mortal.\\"[70]\\r\\nThe Orthodox Church in America makes clear the distinction between \\"fallen nature\\" and \\"fallen man\\" and this is affirmed in the early teaching of the Church whose role it is to act as the catalyst that leads to true or inner redemption. Every human person born on this earth bears the image of God undistorted within themselves.[71] In the Orthodox Christian understanding, they explicitly deny that humanity inherited guilt from anyone. Rather, they maintain that we inherit our fallen nature. While humanity does bear the consequences of the original, or first, sin, humanity does not bear the personal guilt associated with this sin. Adam and Eve are guilty of their willful action; we bear the consequences, chief of which is death.\\"[72]\\r\\nThe view of the Eastern Orthodox Church varies on whether Mary is free of all actual sin or concupiscence. Some Patristic sources imply that she was cleansed from sin at the Annunciation, while the liturgical references are unanimous that she is all-holy from the time of her conception.[73][74]\\r\\nThe original formularies of the Church of England also continue in the Reformation understanding of original sin. In the Thirty-Nine Articles, Article IX \\"Of Original or Birth-sin\\" states:\\r\\nOriginal Sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do vainly talk); but it is the fault and corruption of the Nature of every man, that naturally is ingendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the spirit; and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God's wrath and damnation. And this infection of nature doth remain, yea in them that are regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called in the Greek, ϫ ϫϰ?, which some do expound the wisdom, some sensuality, some the affection, some the desire, of the flesh, is not subject to the Law of God. And although there is no condemnation for them that believe and are baptized, yet the Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin.[75]\\r\\nHowever, more recent doctrinal statements (e.g. the 1938 report Doctrine in the Church of England) permit a greater variety of understandings of this doctrine. The 1938 report summarizes:\\r\\nMan is by nature capable of communion with God, and only through such communion can he become what he was created to be. \\"Original sin\\" stands for the fact that from a time apparently prior to any responsible act of choice man is lacking in this communion, and if left to his own resources and to the influence of his natural environment cannot attain to his destiny as a child of God.[76]\\r\\nThe Methodist Church upholds Article VII in the Articles of Religion in the Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church:\\r\\nOriginal sin standeth not in the following of Adam (as the Pelagians do vainly talk), but it is the corruption of the nature of every man, that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam, whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and of his own nature inclined to evil, and that continually.[77]\\r\\nSeventh-day Adventists believe that humans are inherently sinful due to the fall of Adam,[78] but they do not totally accept the Augustinian/Calvinistic understanding of original sin, taught in terms of original guilt, but hold more to what could be termed the \\"total depravity\\" tradition.[79] Seventh-day Adventists have historically preached a doctrine of inherited weakness, but not a doctrine of inherited guilt.[80] According to Augustine and Calvin, humanity inherits not only Adam's depraved nature but also the actual guilt of his transgression, and Adventists look more toward the Wesleyan model.[81]\\r\\nIn part, the Adventist position on original sin reads:\\r\\nThe nature of the penalty for original sin, i.e., Adam's sin, is to be seen as literal, physical, temporal, or actual death ÿ the opposite of life, i.e., the cessation of being. By no stretch of the scriptural facts can death be spiritualised as depravity. God did not punish Adam by making him a sinner. That was Adams own doing. All die the first death because of Adams sin regardless of their moral character ÿ children included.[81]\\r\\nEarly Adventists Pioneers (such as George Storrs and Uriah Smith) tended to de-emphasise the morally corrupt nature inherited from Adam, while stressing the importance of actual, personal sins committed by the individual. They thought of the \\"sinful nature\\" in terms of physical mortality rather than moral depravity.[81] Traditionally, Adventists look at sin in terms of willful transgressions, and that Christ triumphed over sin. Adventism believes that Christ is both our Substitute and our Example.[82] They base their belief on texts such as \\"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.\\" (1 John 3:4)[83]\\r\\nThough believing in the concept of inherited sin from Adam, there is no dogmatic Adventist position on original sin. Related articles dealing with the subject are publicly available on the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Churchs official website on theological doctrine, the Biblical Research Institute.[84]\\r\\nAccording to the theology of the Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses, all humans are born sinners, because of inheriting sin, corruption, and death from Adam. They teach that Adam was originally created perfect and sinless, but with free will; that the Devil, who was originally a perfect angel, but later developed feelings of pride and self-importance, seduced Eve, and then through her, persuaded Adam to disobey God, and to obey the Devil instead, rebelling against God's sovereignty, thereby making themselves sinners, and because of that, transmitting a sinful nature to all of their future offspring.[85][86] Instead of destroying the Devil right away, as well as destroying the disobedient couple, God decided to test the loyalty of the rest of humankind, and to prove that man cannot be independent of God successfully, that man is lost without God's laws and standards, and can never bring peace to the earth, and that Satan was a deceiver, murderer, and liar.[87]\\r\\nWitnesses believe that all men possess \\"inherited sin\\" from the \\"one man\\" Adam and they teach that verses such as Romans 5:12-22, Psalm 51:5, Job 14:4, and 1st Corinthians 15:22 show that man is born corrupt, and dies because of inherited sin and imperfection, that inherited sin is the reason and cause for sickness and suffering, made worse by the Devil's wicked influence. They believe Jesus is the \\"second Adam\\", being the sinless Son of God and the Messiah, and that he came to undo Adamic sin; and that salvation and everlasting life can only be obtained through faith and obedience to the second Adam.[85][86][87][88][89][90] They believe that \\"sin\\" is \\"missing the mark\\" of God's standard of perfection, and that everyone is born a sinner, due to being the offspring of sinner Adam.[91]\\r\\nThe Book of Mormon, a text sacred to Mormonism, explains that the opportunity to live here in a world where we can learn good and bad is a gift from God, and not a punishment for Adam's and Eve's choice.[92] As Mormon founder Joseph Smith taught, humans had an essentially godlike nature, and were not only holy in a premortal state, but had the potential to progress eternally to become like God.[93] He wrote as one of his church's Articles of Faith, \\"We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adams transgression.\\"[94] Later Mormons took this creed as a rejection of the doctrine of original sin and any notion of inherited sinfulness.[93] Thus, while modern Mormons will agree that the fall of Adam brought consequences to the world, including the possibility of sin, they generally reject the idea that any culpability is automatically transmitted to Adam and Eve's offspring.[95] Children under the age of eight are regarded as free of all sin and therefore do not require baptism.[96] Children who die prior to age eight are believed to be saved in the highest degree of heaven.[97]\\r\\nIn Swedenborgianism, exegesis of the first 11 chapters of Genesis from The First Church, has a view that Adam is not an individual person. Rather, he is a symbolic representation of the \\"Most Ancient Church\\", having a more direct contact with heaven than all other successive churches.[98][99] Swedenborg's view of original sin is referred to as hereditary evil, which passes from generation to generation.[100] It cannot be completely abolished by an individual man, but can be tempered when someone reforms their own life,[101] and are thus held accountable only for their own sins.[102]\\r\\nMost Quakers (also known as the Religious Society of Friends), including the founder of Quakerism, George Fox, believe in the doctrine of Inward light, a doctrine which states that there is \\"that of God in everyone\\".[103] This has led to a common belief among many liberal and universalist Quakers affiliated with the Friends General Conference and Britain Yearly Meeting, based on the ideas of Quaker Rufus Jones among others, that rather than being burdened by original sin, human beings are inherently good, and the doctrine of universal reconciliation, that is, that all people will eventually be saved and reconciled with God.\\r\\nHowever, this rejection of the doctrine of original sin or the necessity of salvation is not something that most conservative or evangelical Quakers affiliated with Friends United Meeting or Evangelical Friends Church International tend to agree with. Although the more conservative and evangelical Quakers also believe in the doctrine of inward light, they interpret it in a manner consistent with the doctrine of original sin, namely, that people may or may not listen to the voice of God within them and be saved, and people who do not listen will not be saved, thus there cannot be any universal reconciliation under the more conservative Quaker theology. Many more liberal Quaker meetings have no official creed and allow individual Quakers to have a wide variety of different beliefs, although following the recommendations of one's yearly meeting's Faith and Practice book is strongly recommended even though not mandatory.\\r\\nAlso, not all local Quaker meetings are entirely liberal or conservative and some have members adhering to different Quaker traditions, and a Quaker meeting can be affiliated with both liberal and conservative umbrella organizations. For instance, New York Yearly Meeting, which is mostly liberal, is affiliated with both the liberal Friends General Conference as well as the conservative Friends United Meeting, even though they adhere much more to the liberal teachings of Friends General Conference than the conservative teachings of Friends United Meeting.[104][105] Thus, at any given Quaker meeting, individual Quakers may have differing views on a wide variety of theological issues including original sin, with more conservative Quaker meetings having everyone believe in original sin while at more liberal Quaker meetings there is typically a variety of beliefs and usually a majority of people would not believe in original sin but a minority would believe in original sin.\\r\\nThe doctrine of \\"inherited sin\\" is not found in most of mainstream Judaism. Although some in Orthodox Judaism place blame on Adam for overall corruption of the world, and though there were some Jewish teachers in Babylon[106] who believed that death was a punishment brought upon humanity on account of Adam's sin, that is not the dominant view in most of Judaism today. Modern Judaism generally teaches that humans are born sin-free and untainted, and choose to sin later and bring suffering to themselves.[107][108]\\r\\nJewish theologians are divided in regard to the cause of what is called \\"original sin\\". Some teach that it was due to Adam's yielding to temptation in eating of the forbidden fruit and has been inherited by his descendants; the majority of chazalic opinions, however, do not hold Adam responsible for the sins of humanity,[109] teaching that, in Genesis 8:21 and 6:5-8, God recognized that Adam did not willfully sin. However, Adam is recognized by some[106] as having brought death into the world by his disobedience. Because of his sin, his descendants will live a mortal life, which will end in death of their bodies.[110]\\r\\nThe concept of inherited sin does not exist in Islam.[111][112] Islam teaches that Adam and Eve sinned, but then sought forgiveness and thus were forgiven by God.[113]\\r\\nThe Qur'an says that after Adam and Eve sinned, they asked for repentance and it was granted:\\r\\nThey said: \\"Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves souls. If You forgive us not and bestow not upon us Your mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers.\\r\\nThus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray. Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance.\\r\\nThe Qur'an further says about individual responsibility:\\r\\nThat no burdened person (with sins) shall bear the burden (sins) of another. And that man can have nothing but what he does (of good and bad). And that his deeds will be seen, Then he will be recompensed with a full and the best [fair] recompense.","input":"When did the doctrine of original sin begin?"},{"output":"Shri.

They are widely used in the food industry, for their gelling, thickening, and stabilizing properties. Their main application is in dairy and meat products, due to their strong binding to food proteins. There are three main varieties of carrageenan, which differ in their degree of sulfation. Kappa-carrageenan has one sulfate group per disaccharide, iota-carrageenan has two, and lambda-carrageenan has three.\\r\\nGelatinous extracts of the Chondrus crispus (Irish moss) seaweed have been used as food additives since approximately the fifteenth century.[1] Carrageenan is a vegetarian and vegan alternative to gelatin in some applications or may be used to replace gelatin in confectionery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrageenans are large, highly flexible molecules that curl forming helical structures. This gives them the ability to form a variety of different gels at room temperature. They are widely used in the food and other industries as thickening and stabilizing agents.\\r\\nAll carrageenans are high-molecular-weight polysaccharides made up of repeating galactose units and 3,6 anhydrogalactose (3,6-AG), both sulfated and nonsulfated. The units are joined by alternating ϫ-1,3 and -1,4 glycosidic linkages.\\r\\nThere are three main commercial classes of carrageenan:\\r\\nThe primary differences that influence the properties of kappa, iota, and lambda carrageenan are the number and position of the ester sulfate groups on the repeating galactose units. Higher levels of ester sulfate lower the solubility temperature of the carrageenan and produce lower strength gels, or contribute to gel inhibition (lambda carrageenan).\\r\\nMany red algal species produce different types of carrageenans during their developmental history. For instance, the genus Gigartina produces mainly kappa carrageenans during its gametophytic stage, and lambda carrageenans during its sporophytic stage.\\r\\nAll are soluble in hot water, but in cold water, only the lambda form (and the sodium salts of the other two) are soluble.\\r\\nWhen used in food products, carrageenan has the EU additive E numbers E407 or E407a when present as \\"processed eucheuma seaweed\\".[3] Technically carrageenan is considered a dietary fibre.[4][5]\\r\\nIn parts of Scotland and Ireland, where it is known by a variety of local and native names, Chondrus crispus is boiled in milk and strained, before sugar and other flavourings such as vanilla, cinnamon, brandy, or whisky are added. The end-product is a kind of jelly similar to panna cotta, tapioca, or blancmange.\\r\\nAlthough carrageenans were introduced on an industrial scale in the 1930s, they were first used in China around 600 B.C. (where Gigartina was used) and in Ireland around 400 A.D.[6] Carrageen gelatin can be prepared by boiling 5 ounces (142 gm) of rinsed Irish moss in 8 quarts (7.57 litres) of water for 10 minutes, stirring the mixture as it boils. Two quarts (1.9 litres) of cold water are rapidly added to the hot brew, and after the mixture has cooled, it is strained through a cloth. It is then cooled for 24 hours, during which time it becomes gelatinous.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs of 2011[update], global sales of carrageenan were estimated at $640 million.[7] The largest producer of industrial carrageenan was the Philippines, where cultivated seaweed produces about 80% of the world supply,[8] while China is the main exporter to global markets in the US and Europe.[7] The most commonly used sources are E. cottonii (Kappaphycus alvarezii, K. striatum) and E. spinosum (Eucheuma denticulatum), which together provide about three-quarters of the world production. These grow from the sea surface to a depth of about 2 metres. The seaweed is normally grown on nylon lines strung between bamboo floats, and it is harvested after three months or so, when each plant weighs approximately 1?kg.\\r\\nThe E. cottonii variety has been reclassified as Kappaphycus cottonii by Maxwell Doty (1988), thereby introducing the genus Kappaphycus, on the basis of the phycocolloids produced (namely kappa carrageenan).[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter harvest, the seaweed is dried, baled, and sent to the carrageenan manufacturer. There the seaweed is ground, sifted to remove impurities such as sand, and washed thoroughly. After treatment with hot alkali solution (e.g., 5ÿ8% potassium hydroxide), the cellulose is removed from the carrageenan by centrifugation and filtration. The resulting carrageenan solution is then concentrated by evaporation. It is dried and ground to specification.\\r\\nThere are three types of industrial processing:\\r\\nThis is only performed using E. cottonii or E. spinosum. The raw weed is first sorted and crude contaminants are removed by hand. The weed is then washed to remove salt and sand, and then cooked in hot alkali to increase the gel strength. The cooked weed is washed, dried, and milled. E. spinosum undergoes a much milder cooking cycle, as it dissolves quite readily. The product is called semi-refined carrageenan, Philippines natural grade or, in the U.S., it simply falls under the common carrageenan specification.[9]\\r\\nThe essential difference in the refining process is that the carrageenan is first dissolved and filtered to remove cell wall debris. The carrageenan is then precipitated from the clear solution either by isopropanol or by potassium chloride.[10]\\r\\nA hybrid technology in which seaweed is treated heterogeneously as in the semirefined process exists, but alcohol or high salt levels are used to inhibit dissolution. This process is often used on South American seaweeds and gives some of the cost benefits of semirefined processing, while allowing a wider range of seaweeds to be processed, however, the naturally low cellulose levels in some South American seaweeds allow them to be heterogeneously processed and still be sold under the EU refined specification.\\r\\nThere are two basic grades of carrageenan: refined carrageenan (RC) and semi-refined carrageenan (SRC). In the United States both grades are labeled as carrageenan. In the European Union, refined carrageenan is designated by the E number E-407, and semi-refined carrageenan as E-407a.[3] Refined carrageenan has a 2% maximum for acid insoluble material and is produced through an alcohol precipitation process or potassium chloride gel press process. Semi-refined carrageenan contains a much higher level of cellulosic content and is produced in a less complex process. Indonesia, the Philippines, and Chile are three main sources of raw material and extracted carrageenan.\\r\\nIn the U.S., carrageenan is allowed under FDA regulations[11] as a direct food additive and is considered safe[12] when used in the amount necessary as an emulsifier, stabilizer, or thickener in foods, except those standardized foods that do not provide for such use. FDA also reviewed carrageenan safety for infant formula.[13] The European Food Safety Authority concluded \\"there is no evidence of any adverse effects in humans from exposure to food-grade carrageenan, or that exposure to degraded carrageenan from use of food-grade carrageenan is occurring\\",[14] Furthermore, the Joint FAO/WHO expert committee on food additives stated in a July 2014 review of carrageenan \\"that the use of carrageenan in infant formula or formula for special medical purposes at concentrations up to 1000 mg/L is not of concern\\".[15]\\r\\nAlthough the National Organic Program (NOP) had added carrageenan to its National List of additives allowed to be included in organic foods in 2003,[16] and reviewed and reauthorized it in 2008,[17] noting it as \\"critical to organic production and handling operations\\",[18] on November 18, 2016 the NOP's National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) voted to recommend carrageenan be removed from the National List of additives allowed in organic food production.[19] The NOSBs recommendation is under review by the United States Department of Agricultures Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS).[20] If the AMS accepts the NOSBs recommendation, a proposed rule to remove carrageenan from organic foods will be published to the Federal Register no later than November 2017.[21]\\r\\nIn the most recent review by an independent panel, the Joint Expert Committee of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and World Health Organization on Food Additives released a technical report in 2015 on the use of carrageenan in infant formula and found that the additive was not of concern in infant formula as food for special medical purposes at concentrations up to 1000 milligrams per litre.[22] The use of carrageenan in infant formula, organic or otherwise, is prohibited in the EU for precautionary reasons, but is permitted in other food items.[23]\\r\\nCarrageenan has been studied in laboratory animals for its potential effects on intestinal and immune functions following oral intake or gavage, with no effects on organ pathology, clinical chemistry, hematology, or normal health.[24] Dietary carrageenan had no carcinogenic, genotoxic, developmental, or reproductive effects in laboratory animals, and was found to be safe in one study on human infants.[24]","input":"Which type of algae do carrageenans come from?"},{"output":"7 July 1950","context":"Group Areas Act was the title of three acts of the Parliament of South Africa enacted under the apartheid government of South Africa. The acts assigned racial groups to different residential and business sections in urban areas in a system of urban apartheid. An effect of the law was to exclude non-Whites from living in the most developed areas, which were restricted to Whites (e.g., Sea Point, Lansdowne, Cape Town, Claremont, Cape Town). It caused many non-Whites to have to commute large distances from their homes in order to be able to work. The law led to non-Whites being forcibly removed for living in the \\"wrong\\" areas. The non-white majority were given much smaller areas (e.g., Tongaat, Grassy Park) to live in than the white minority who owned most of the country. Pass Laws required that non-Whites carry pass books, and later 'reference books'[1] (similar to passports) to enter the 'white' parts of the country.\\r\\nThe first Group Areas Act, the Group Areas Act, 1950 was promulgated on 7 July 1950, and it was implemented over a period of several years. It was amended by Parliament in 1952, 1955 (twice), 1956 and 1957. Later in 1957 it was repealed and re-enacted in consolidated form as the Group Areas Act, 1957, which was amended in 1961, 1962, and 1965. In 1966 this version was in turn repealed and re-enacted as the Group Areas Act, 1966, which was subsequently amended in 1969, 1972, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1982, and 1984. It was repealed (along with many other discriminatory laws) on 30 June 1991 by the Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 1948 general election, D.F. Malan's administration commenced its policy of apartheid that sought to segregate the races in South Africa. The government hoped to achieve this through 'separate development' of the races and this entailed passing laws that would ensure a distinction on social, economic, political and, in the case of the Group Areas Act, geographical lines.[2] The Group Areas Act may be regarded as an extension of the Asiatic Land Tenure Act, 1946.[3]\\r\\nThe Act empowered the Governor-General to declare certain geographical areas to be for the exclusive occupation of specific racial groups. In particular the statute identified three such racial groups: whites, coloureds and natives. This authority was exercised on the advice of the Minister of the Interior and the Group Areas Board.[4]\\r\\nOnce an area had been designated for sole occupation by certain racial groups the proclamation would not become legally effective for at least one year.[4] Once this time had expired it became a criminal offence to remain in occupation of property in that area with the punishment potentially being a fine and two years' imprisonment.[5]\\r\\nThe Act also applied to businesses with racial designation being applied on the basis of the individuals who held a controlling interest in the company.[4]\\r\\nThe Act became an effective tool in the separate development of races in South Africa. It also granted the Minister of the Interior a mandate to forcibly remove non-whites from valuable pieces of land so that they could become white settlements.[4]\\r\\nOne of the most famous uses of the Group Areas Act was the destruction of Sophiatown, a suburb of Johannesburg.[6] On 9 February 1955 2,000 policemen began removing residents in Meadowlands, Soweto and erection a new white-only area called Triomf (Victory).[7] One of the main impacts was on education as many pupils were not able to receive the facilities they required and were disadvantaged. The impact on people's lives was that they were disadvantaged of deserved job positions.","input":"When was the law group areas act passed?"},{"output":"Waylon Jennings","context":"The Dukes of Hazzard is an American action-comedy television series that aired on CBS from January 26, 1979, to February 8, 1985. The show aired for a total of 147 episodes spanning seven seasons. The series was inspired by the 1975 film Moonrunners, which was also created by Gy Waldron and had many identical or similar character names and concepts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dukes of Hazzard had an ensemble cast, which also follows the adventures of \\"The Duke Boys,\\" cousins Bo Duke (John Schneider) and Luke Duke (Tom Wopat) (including Coy and Vance Duke for most of season 5), who live on a family farm in fictional Hazzard County, Georgia, with their attractive female cousin Daisy (Catherine Bach) and their wise old Uncle Jesse (Denver Pyle). The Duke boys race around in their customized 1969 Dodge Charger stock car, dubbed (The) General Lee, evading crooked and corrupt county commissioner Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke) and his bumbling and corrupt Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best) along with his deputy(s), and always managing to get caught in the middle of the various escapades and incidents that often occur in the area. Bo and Luke had previously been sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine; their Uncle Jesse made a plea bargain with the U.S. Government to refrain from distilling moonshine in exchange for Bo and Luke's freedom. As a result, Bo and Luke are on probation and not allowed to carry firearms? instead, they often use compound bows, sometimes with arrows tipped with dynamite  or to leave Hazzard County unless they get probation permission from their probation officer, Boss Hogg, although the exact details of their probation terms vary from episode to episode. Sometimes it is implied that they would be jailed for merely crossing the county line; on other occasions, it is shown that they may leave Hazzard, as long as they are back within a certain time limit. Several other technicalities of their probation also came into play at various times.\\r\\nCorrupt county commissioner Jefferson Davis (J.D.) \\"Boss\\" Hogg, who either runs or has fingers in virtually everything in Hazzard County, is forever angry with the Dukes, especially Bo and Luke, for always foiling his crooked schemes. He is always looking for ways to get them out of the picture so that his plots have a chance of succeeding. Many episodes revolve around Hogg trying to engage in an illegal scheme, sometimes with aid of hired criminal help. Some of these are get-rich-quick schemes, though many others affect the financial security of the Duke farm, which Hogg has long wanted to acquire for various reasons. Other times, Hogg hires criminals from out of town to do his dirty work for him, and often tries to frame Bo and Luke for various crimes as part of these plots. Bo and Luke always seem to stumble over Hogg's latest scheme, sometimes by curiosity, and often by sheer luck, and put it out of business. Despite the Dukes often coming to his rescue (see below), Hogg forever seems to have an irrational dislike of the clan, particularly Bo and Luke, often accusing them of spying on him, robbing or planning to rob him, and other supposedly nefarious actions, as he believes they are generally out to get him.\\r\\nThe role of Boss Hogg was played by Sorrell Booke, who performed frequently on radio, stage, and film prior to his role in The Dukes of Hazzard. Boss Hogg is one of only two characters to appear in every episode of the TV series, the other being Uncle Jesse Duke. His namesake is Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederate States of America.\\r\\nThe other main characters of the show include local mechanic Cooter Davenport (Ben Jones), who in early episodes was portrayed as a wild, unshaven rebel, often breaking or treading on the edge of the law, before settling down to become the Duke family's best friend (he is often referred to as an \\"honorary Duke\\") and owns the local garage; and Enos Strate (Sonny Shroyer), an honest but naive young deputy who, despite his friendship with the Dukes (and his crush on Daisy), is reluctantly forced to take part in Hogg and Rosco's crooked schemes. In the third and fourth seasons, when Enos leaves for his own show, he is replaced by Deputy Cletus Hogg (Rick Hurst), Boss's cousin, who is slightly more wily than Enos but still a somewhat reluctant player in Hogg's plots.\\r\\nOwing to their fundamentally good natures, the Dukes often wind up helping Boss Hogg out of trouble, albeit grudgingly. More than once Hogg is targeted by former associates who are either seeking revenge or have double crossed him after a scheme has unraveled in one way or another. Sheriff Coltrane also finds himself targeted in some instances. On such occasions, Bo and Luke usually have to rescue their adversaries as an inevitable precursor to defeating the bad guys; in other instances, the Dukes join forces with Hogg and Coltrane to tackle bigger threats to Hazzard or one of their respective parties. These instances became more frequent as the show progressed, and later seasons saw a number of stories where the Dukes and Hogg (and Coltrane) temporarily work together.\\r\\nThe series was developed from the 1975 film Moonrunners. Created by Gy Waldron in collaboration with ex-moonshiner Jerry Rushing, this movie shares many identical and very similar names and concepts with the subsequent TV series. Although itself essentially a comedy, this original movie was much cruder and edgier than the family-friendly TV series that would evolve from it.\\r\\nIn 1977, Waldron was approached by Warner Bros. with the idea of developing Moonrunners into a television series. Waldron reworked various elements from Moonrunners, and from it was devised what would become The Dukes of Hazzard. Production began in October 1978 with the original intention of only nine episodes being produced as mid-season filler. The first five episodes were filmed in Covington and Conyers, Georgia and surrounding areas, including some location work in nearby Atlanta. After completing production on the fifth episode, \\"High Octane\\", the cast and crew broke for Christmas break, expecting to return in several weeks' time to complete the ordered run of episodes. In the meantime, executives at Warner Bros. were impressed by the rough preview cuts of the completed episodes and saw potential in developing the show into a full-running series; part of this plan was to move production from Georgia to the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, California, primarily to simplify production as well as develop a larger workshop to service the large number of automobiles needed for the series.\\r\\nRushing appeared as shady used car dealer Ace Parker in the third episode produced, \\"Repo Men\\" (the fourth to be broadcast). Rushing believed this to be the start of a recurring role, in return for which he would supply creative ideas from his experiences: many of the Dukes (and thus Moonrunners) characters and situations were derived from Rushing's experiences as a youth, and much of the character of Bo Duke he states to be based on him. However, \\"Repo Men\\" would turn out to be the character's only appearance in the entire show's run, leading to a legal dispute in the following years over the rights to characters and concepts between Rushing and Warner Bros., although he remained on good terms with cast and crew and in recent years has made appearances at several fan conventions.\\r\\nBy the end of the first (half) season, the family-friendly tone of The Dukes of Hazzard was mostly in place. When the show returned for a second season in Fall 1979 (its first full season), with a few further minor tweaks, the show quickly found its footing as a family-friendly comedy-adventure series. By the third season, starting in Fall 1980, the template was well set in place for that which would be widely associated with the show.\\r\\nAs well as its regular car chases, jumps and stunts, The Dukes of Hazzard relied on character familiarity, with each character effectively serving the same role within a typical episode, and with Deputy Cletus replacing Deputy Enos in Seasons 3 and 4, and Coy and Vance Duke temporarily replacing Bo and Luke (due to a salary dispute) for most of Season 5, being the only major cast changes through the show's run (Ben Jones and James Best both left temporarily during the second season due to different disputes with producers, but both returned within a few episodes). Of the characters, only Uncle Jesse and Boss Hogg appeared in all 145 episodes; Daisy appears in all but one, the third season's \\"To Catch a Duke\\". The General Lee also appears in all but one (the early first-season episode \\"Mary Kaye's Baby\\", the fourth to be produced and the third broadcast).\\r\\nThe pilot episode was to include a barber modeled after Floyd Lawson on The Andy Griffith Show as a regular character, but was eliminated when the final draft of the pilot's script was written and before the show was cast.\\r\\nWhen John Schneider auditioned for the role of Bo Duke, he came to the audition in a dilapidated pickup truck, sporting a week-long beard growth, wearing overalls and a white T-shirt with a pack of cigarettes rolled up in a sleeve collar, and carrying a can of beer, trying to look the part. At the audition, Schneider drank the beer and said he was from Snellville. The producers bought his \\"Good Ol' Boy\\" act and Schneider was hired on the spot.\\r\\nThroughout its network television run, The Dukes of Hazzard had a consistent mix of up-and-comers and established stars make guest appearances.\\r\\nNASCAR driver Terry Labonte makes a brief, uncredited appearance as a crewman in the episode Undercover Dukes Part 1. The race cars supplied for both part 1 and part 2 of Undercover Dukes were supplied by Labonte's race owner, Billy Hagan. However, the emblems of the sponsors of the cars (at that time Labonte was sponsored by Budweiser) were covered to avoid paying royalties.\\r\\nDuring the show's second season, the show's writers began flirting with the idea of incorporating a \\"celebrity speed trap\\" into some of the episodes, as a means to feature top country stars of the day performing their hits. On its first couple of instances, the \\"Speed Trap\\" was featured early in the story, but for most of the cases, it was featured in the last few minutes of an episode, often used when the main story was running too short to fill episode time.\\r\\nThe \\"celebrity speed trap\\" feature was essentially similar: Aware that a big-name country star was passing through the area, Boss Hogg would order Rosco to lower the speed limit on a particular road to an unreasonable level (using a reversible sign, with one speed limit on one side and another, far lower, on the back), so that the targeted singer would be in violation of the posted limit. The singer would be required to give a free performance at the Boar's Nest in exchange for having their citations forgiven; the performer would then perform one of their best-known hits or other popular country music standard, while the Dukes, Boss, Rosco, Enos, Cletus, Cooter, and other patrons whooped and hollered in enjoyment of the performance. More often than not, the performer would give a sarcastic parting shot to Boss and Rosco.\\r\\nSingers who were featured in the \\"speed trap\\" segments were:\\r\\nHonorable Mentions: Mickey Gilley, Loretta Lynn\\r\\nGilley's and Lynn's appearances were not solely for the celebrity speed trap. After performing a concert in Hazzard, Gilley was nabbed while leaving and forced to do a second show to nullify his citation. Lynn was kidnapped by criminals wanting to break into the music business. Loretta Lynn was the very first country music guest star on the show in 1979 and had an entire show titled \\"Find Loretta Lynn.\\"\\r\\nNote: Janie Fricke was the only guest country star who did not perform a song, celebrity speed trap or otherwise. She played an accomplice to a robber in an episode who hid money in the dashboard of the car that was to become the General Lee.\\r\\nThe Dukes of Hazzard was consistently among the top-rated television series (at one point, ranking second only to Dallas, which immediately followed the show on CBS' Friday night schedule). With that success came huge profits in merchandising, with a wide array of Dukes of Hazzard toys and products being licensed and becoming big sellers. However, over the course of the show's fourth season, series stars Tom Wopat and John Schneider became increasingly concerned about a contract dispute over their salaries and merchandising royalties owed to them over the high sales of Dukes products. Neither were being paid what was owed to them and this became very frustrating to the duo. As a result, in the spring of 1982, as filming was due to begin on the fifth season, Wopat and Schneider did not report to the set in protest over the matter. Catherine Bach also considered walking out due to similar concerns, but Wopat and Schneider convinced her to stay, insisting that if she left then there may not be a show to come back to, and that settling the issue was up to them.[4]\\r\\nProduction was pushed back by a few weeks as fairly similar looking replacements were subsequently, hastily hired: Byron Cherry as Coy Duke and Christopher Mayer as Vance Duke. Bo and Luke were said to have gone to race on the NASCAR circuit; how they managed to do this, bearing in mind the terms of their probation, was never explained. Cherry and Mayer were originally contracted at just ten episodes as stand-ins, still with hope that a settlement might be reached with Wopat and Schneider[5] (in total, they made 19 episodes including 1 with Bo and Luke). Some scripts for Coy and Vance were originally written for Bo and Luke but with their names quite literally crossed out and Coy and Vance penned in.[4]\\r\\nThe new Dukes  previously-unmentioned nephews of Uncle Jesse, who were said to have left the farm in 1976, before the show had started  were unpopular with the great majority of viewers, and the ratings immediately sank. Much of the criticism was that Coy and Vance were nothing but direct clones of Bo and Luke, with Coy a direct \\"carbon copy\\" replacement for Bo and Vance for Luke, with little variation in character. This was something that even show creator Gy Waldron has said was wrong,[6] and that he insisted, unsuccessfully, that audiences would not accept direct character clones and the two replacements should be taken in a different direction characterwise, but was overridden by producers. Waldron also commented that if Bach too had walked, the show would have most probably been cancelled. It was reported that prior to filming, Cherry and Mayer were given Bo and Luke episodes to watch, to study and learn to emulate them, although Cherry has said in interviews that he doesn't recall this ever happening.\\r\\nHit hard by the significant drop in ratings, Warner Bros. renegotiated with Wopat and Schneider, and eventually a settlement was reached, and the original Duke boys returned to the series in early 1983, four episodes from the conclusion of the fifth season. Initially, part of the press release announcing Wopat and Schneider's return suggested that Cherry and Mayer would remain as part of the cast (though presumably in a reduced role),[7] but it was quickly realized that \\"four Duke boys\\" would not work within the context of the series, and due to the huge unpopularity associated with their time on the show, they were quickly written out of the same episode in which Bo and Luke returned.\\r\\nAlthough Coy and Vance were never popular with the majority, a few viewers were disappointed by their departure episode, \\"Welcome Back, Bo 'N' Luke\\", which was for the most part a standard episode, with the return of Bo and Luke and the departure of Coy and Vance tacked onto the beginning (Bo and Luke return from their NASCAR tour just as Coy and Vance leave Hazzard to tend to a sick relative). Even a few viewers commented that they were disappointed by this, and that they would have liked to have seen both pairs of Duke boys team up to tackle a particularly dastardly plot by Boss Hogg before Coy and Vance's departure, but as it turned out, Coy and Vance had little dialogue and were gone by the first commercial break, never to be seen again.[8]\\r\\nWhile the return of Bo and Luke was welcomed by ardent and casual viewers alike, and as a result ratings recovered slightly, the show never completely regained its former popularity. One of Wopat and Schneider's disputes even before they left was what they considered to be increasingly weak and formulaic scripts and episode plots.[9] With Wopat and Schneider's return, the producers agreed to try a wider scope of storylines.[10] However, although it continued for two more seasons, the show never fully returned to its former glory. Many cast members[who?] decried the miniature car effects newly incorporated to depict increasingly absurd General Lee and patrol car stunts (which had previously been performed with real cars by stunt drivers). The miniature car effects were intended as a budget saving measure (to save the cost of repairing or replacing damaged vehicles) and to help compete visually with KITT from the NBC series Knight Rider.[citation needed] In February 1985, The Dukes of Hazzard ended its run after seven seasons.\\r\\nThe General Lee was based on a 1969 Dodge Charger owned by Bo and Luke (the series used mostly 1969 Chargers in the beginning; later on, they also modified 1968 Chargers to look like 1969s by installing 1969-model taillamps, taillamp panels, and grilles). It was orange with a Confederate battle flag painted on the roof, the words \\"GENERAL LEE\\" over each door, and the number \\"01\\" on each door. In the original five Georgia-filmed episodes, a Confederate flag along with a checkered racing flag in a criss-cross pattern could be seen behind the rear window; this was removed when it was felt that this extra detail did not show up enough on-screen to warrant the already very tight time constraints of preparing and repairing each example of the car. The name refers to the American Civil War Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The television show was based on the movie Moonrunners, in turn based on actual moonshine runners who used a 1958 Chrysler named Traveler, after General Lee's horse (with a slight spelling change). Traveler was originally intended to be the name of the Duke boys' stock car too, until producers agreed that General Lee had more punch to it.\\r\\nSince it was built as a race car, the doors were welded shut. Through the history of the show, an estimated 309 Chargers were used; 17 are still known to exist in various states of repair. A replica was owned by John Schneider, known as \\"Bo's General Lee.\\" In 2008, Schneider sold \\"Bo's General Lee\\" at the Barrett-Jackson automobile auction for $230,000. An eBay auction which garnered a bid of $9,900,500 for the car was never finalized, with the purported bidder claiming his account had been hacked.[11] The underside of the hood has the signatures of the cast from the 1997 TV movie. Schneider has also restored over 20 other General Lees to date. In 2008, a replica of the General Lee fetched a high bid of $450,000 at the Barrett-Jackson auto auction, indicating the significant interest in the car as a cultural icon. In 2012, the \\"General Lee 1\\", the first car used in filming the series, was purchased at auction by golfer Bubba Watson for $110,000. The car had been scrapped after being wrecked during the famous opening jump shoot, and was later discovered in a junk-yard by the president of the North American General Lee fan club.[12] In 2015, following a wave of sentiment against confederate symbolism in the wake of shootings in Charleston, SC, (relating to photos where the attacker had posed with the Confederate flag), Bubba Watson announced that he would remove the Confederate Flag from the roof of General Lee 1 and repaint it with the US National Flag.[13]\\r\\nThe show also used 1968 Chargers (which shared the same sheet metal) by changing the grille and taillight panel to the 1969 style, and removing the round side marker lights. These Chargers performed many record-breaking jumps throughout the show, almost all of them resulting in a completely destroyed car. The 1970 Chargers were modified by removing the chrome bumper and changing the taillights.\\r\\nThe Duke boys added a custom air horn to the General Lee that played the first twelve notes of the song Dixie. The Dixie horn was not originally planned, until a Georgia local hot rod racer drove by and sounded his car's Dixie horn. The producers immediately rushed after him asking where he had bought the horn. Warner Bros. purchased several Chargers for stunts, as they generally destroyed at least one or two cars per episode. By the end of the show's sixth season, the Chargers were becoming harder to find, and more expensive. In addition, the television series Knight Rider began to rival the General Lee's stunts. As such, the producers used 1:8 scale miniatures, filmed by Jack Sessums' crew, or recycled stock jump footage  the latter being a practice that had been in place to an extent since the second season, and had increased as the seasons passed.\\r\\nSome of the 01 and Confederate flag motifs were initially hand painted, but as production sped up, these were replaced with vinyl decals for quick application (and removal), as needed.\\r\\nDuring the first five episodes of the show that were filmed in Georgia, the cars involved with filming were given to the crew at H&H body shop near the filming location. At this shop, the men worked day and night to prepare the wrecked cars for the next day while still running their body shop during the day. Time was of the essence, and the men that worked at this shop worked hard hours to get the cars prepared for the show.\\r\\nThe third episode \\"Mary Kaye's Baby\\" is the only one in which the General Lee does not appear. Instead, the Dukes drove around in a blue 1975 Plymouth Fury borrowed from Cooter that Luke later destroyed by shooting an arrow at the car, whose trunk had been leaking due to the moonshine stowed in the back.\\r\\nThe Duke boys' CB handle was (jointly) \\"Lost Sheep\\". Originally when the show was conceived, their handle was to be \\"General Lee\\" to match their vehicle, but this was only ever used on-screen on one occasion, in the second episode, \\"Daisy's Song\\", when Cooter calls Bo and Luke over the CB by this handle, although they were actually driving Daisy's Plymouth Roadrunner (see below) at the time. As it became obvious that the \\"General Lee\\" handle would be out of place when the Duke boys were in another vehicle, the \\"Lost Sheep\\" handle was devised (with Uncle Jesse being \\"Shepherd\\" and Daisy being \\"Bo Peep\\").\\r\\nThe 1975 AMC Matador[14] was one of many different Hazzard County police cars used on the series, mostly in the first season; they had light bars and working radios. A 1972 Dodge Polara[15] and a 1974 Dodge Monaco[16] were used during the pilot episode \\"One Armed Bandits\\", these were also seen in the show's title sequence. From the second season, the 1977 Dodge Monaco[17] was mostly used. From mid-season four the similar looking 1978 Plymouth Fury[18] was used instead. The Matadors and Furies were former Los Angeles Police Department vehicles, while the Monacos were former California Highway Patrol units.\\r\\nA 1974 Plymouth Road Runner[19] (yellow with a black stripe) was Daisy Duke's car in the first five episodes of the first season. For the last episodes of the first season a similarly painted 1971 model with a matching \\"Road Runner\\" stripe was used. In the second season Bo and Luke send it off a cliff in \\"The Runaway.\\" Another identical Plymouth 1971 model car appeared in the background a few more episodes along with the Jeep CJ-7 until it was finally dropped altogether.\\r\\nDixie was the name given to Daisy Duke's white 1980 Jeep CJ-7 \\"Golden Eagle\\" which had a golden eagle emblem on the hood and the name \\"Dixie\\" on the sides. Like other vehicles in the show, there was actually more than one Jeep used throughout the series. Sometimes it would have an automatic transmission, and other times it would be a manual. The design of the roll cage also varied across the seasons. When the Jeep was introduced at the end of the second season's \\"The Runaway\\", it was seen to have doors and a slightly different paint job, but, bar one appearance in the next produced episode, \\"Arrest Jesse Duke\\" (actually broadcast before \\"The Runaway\\", causing a continuity error), thereafter the doors were removed and the paint job was made all-white, with \\"Dixie\\" painted on the sides of the hood. These Jeeps were leased to the producers of the show by American Motors Corporation in exchange for a brief mention in the closing credits of the show.\\r\\nUncle Jesse's truck was a white Ford pickup truck, most commonly a Sixth generation (1973ÿ1977) F100 Styleside.[20] However, in the earliest episodes it had a Flareside bed, and varied between F100 and F250 models throughout the show's run. Bo, Luke and Daisy also drove Jesse's truck on occasion.\\r\\nA White 1970 Cadillac De Ville convertible was used as Boss Hogg's car, notably with large bull horns as a hood ornament. In early seasons, Hogg was almost always driven by a chauffeur, who was normally nameless and had little or no dialogue, but identified on occasion as being called \\"Alex\\"; and played by several different uncredited actors, including stuntman Gary Baxley. This chauffeur would often be dressed in a red plaid shirt and deep brown or black Stetson hat, but on occasion would be an older man, sometimes dressed in more typical chauffeur attire.\\r\\nHogg is first seen to drive for himself in the second season opener \\"Days of Shine and Roses\\", where he and Jesse challenge each other to one last moonshine race. From the fourth season onward, except for a couple of brief reappearances of the chauffeur (during the fourth season), Hogg drove himself around in his Cadillac (or occasionally driven by Rosco and, in the series' finale, by Uncle Jesse) and frequently challenged others by invoking his driving expertise from his days as a ridge-runner. Unlike other vehicles in the series, Boss Hogg's Cadillac is typically treated with kid gloves. The car is almost always seen with its convertible top down, with the top only being seen in two episodes, \\"Daisy's Song\\" (the chauffeur was called \\"Eddie\\" in this episode), the second to be produced and broadcast, and briefly in the second-season episode \\"Witness for the Persecution\\", when Cooter is returning it to the Court House after repairs.\\r\\nA Green and blacked out 1971 Ford Custom 500 sedan named Black Tilly was used by Uncle Jesse to make moonshine runs.\\r\\nThe theme song \\"The Good Ol' Boys\\" was written and performed by Waylon Jennings. He was also \\"The Balladeer\\" (as credited), and served as narrator of the show. However, the version released as a single is not the same version that was used in the show's opening credits; the single version has a repeat of the chorus and an instrumental to pad out the length, uses a different instrumental mix that emphasizes the bass, and replaces the last verse with an inside joke about how the TV show producers \\"keep on showing (Jennings's) hands and not (his) face on TV.\\"\\r\\nIn 1980, the song reached #1 on the American Country chart and peaked at #21 on the Billboard Hot 100.[21]\\r\\nSoon before the series ended its original run on CBS, The Dukes of Hazzard went into off-network syndication. Although not as widely run as it was back in the 1980s and the years since, reruns of the program do continue to air in various parts of the United States.\\r\\nNotably, television stations that aired the show in syndication include KCOP Los Angeles, WGN-TV Chicago, KBHK San Francisco, WKBD Detroit, WTAF/WTXF Philadelphia, KTXL Sacramento, WVTV Milwaukee, KMSP MinneapolisÿSaint Paul, among others.\\r\\nNationwide, the show also aired on ABC Family (2000ÿ2001, 2004) and CMT (2005ÿ2007, 2010ÿ2012, 2014ÿ15) and TV Land (2015); TV Land dropped the show in the wake of protests and controversy surrounding the display of the Confederate flag.[23]\\r\\nThe Nashville Network bought The Dukes of Hazzard from Warner Bros. in 1997 for well over $10 million; not only did it improve the network's ratings, the show was also popular among younger viewers, a demographic TNN had a notorious difficulty in drawing; The Dukes of Hazzard has run either on TNN or sister network CMT ever since.[24]\\r\\nThe show ran for seven seasons and a total of 145 episodes. Many of the episodes followed a similar structure \\"out-of-town crooks pull a robbery or commit a crime or scandal, Duke boys blamed, spend the rest of the hour clearing their names, the General Lee flies and the squad cars crash\\".[34]\\r\\nThere were two made-for-TV reunion movies that aired on CBS, The Dukes of Hazzard Reunion! (1997) and The Dukes of Hazzard: Hazzard in Hollywood (2000). Also made were The Dukes of Hazzard in 2005 and a direct-to-video prequel The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning in 2007.\\r\\nWarner Home Video has released all seven seasons of The Dukes of Hazzard on DVD in Regions 1 and 2. The two TV-movies that followed the series were released on DVD in Region 1 on June 10, 2008 and in Region 4 on June 4, 2014.[36] In Region 4, Warner has released only the first six seasons on DVD and the two TV movies. The Complete Series & 2 unrated feature films box set was released on DVD in Region 1 on November 14, 2017.[37]\\r\\nThe TV series was also made available for streaming and download through a variety of services.[39]\\r\\nIn 2005, Tom Wopat and John Schneider were reunited during \\"Exposed\\", a fifth season episode of the television series Smallville.[40] Wopat guest-starred as Kansas State Senator Jack Jennings, an old friend of Clark Kent's adoptive father Jonathan Kent (portrayed by Schneider). In the episode, Jennings drives a 1968 Dodge Chargerthe same body style as The General Lee.[41]\\r\\nLizard Lick Towing featured an episode with its repossession specialists Ronnie Shirley and Bobby Brantley repossess a General Lee replica.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2015, in the wake of renewed debate about the symbolism of the Confederate battle flag (which was prominently featured on the General Lee 's roof and panel behind the rear window in the first five episodes), reruns of the original series were pulled from circulation. Warner Bros., which owns the property, announced it would also no longer create merchandise bearing the flag, including miniatures of the General Lee.[42] Although this has led to people making their own custom General Lees and selling them.\\r\\nArtifacts from the show are on display in Luray, Virginia, Nashville, Tennessee and in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Cooter's Place in Luray is overseen by Ben \\"Cooter\\" Jones from the series. The Gatlinburg location features a gift shop, Dukes of Hazzard-themed indoor mini golf and go-cart track, with a small display of costumes, collectibles and artifacts from the show.\\r\\nCovington and Conyers, Georgia; where the original five episodes were produced, have been two major tourist attractions for Dukes of Hazzard fans.\\r\\nDixie Outfitters in Branson, Missouri on Highway 76 has the General Lee and Rosco's police car signed by Daisy, Cooter, Cletus and Enos.[citation needed]","input":"Who narrates the dukes of hazzard tv show?"},{"output":"Rajendra Prasad","context":"The President of India is the head of state of India and the commander-in-chief of the Indian Armed Forces. The President is referred to as the first citizen of India.[1][2] Although vested with these powers by the Constitution of India, the position is largely a ceremonial one and executive powers are de facto exercised by the Prime Minister.[3] The President is elected by the Electoral College composed of elected members of the parliament houses, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, and also members of the Vidhan Sabha, the state legislative assemblies.[2] Presidents may remain in office for a tenure of five years, as stated by article 56, part V, of the Constitution of India. In the case where a President's term of office is terminated early or during the absence of the President, the Vice President assumes office. By article 70 of part V, the parliament may decide how to discharge the functions of the President where this is not possible, or in any other unexpected contingency.[2]\\r\\nRepresentation of Presidents by party of candidacy\\r\\nThere have been 14 Presidents of India since the post was established when India was declared as a republic with the adoption of the Indian constitution in 1950.[4] Apart from these fourteen, three Acting Presidents have also been in office for short periods of time. Varahagiri Venkata Giri became the Acting President in 1969 after Zakir Husain, died in office. Giri was elected President a few months later. He remains the only person to have held office both as a President and Acting President.[5] Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India, is the only person to have held office for two terms.[6]\\r\\nSeven Presidents have been members of a political party before being elected. Six of these were active party members of the Indian National Congress. The Janata Party has had one member, Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, who later became President. Two Presidents, Zakir Husain and Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, have died in office. Their Vice-Presidents served as Acting Presidents until a new President was elected. Following Zakir Husain's death, two acting Presidents held office until the new President, V. V. Giri, was elected.

Repeated concussions are a known cause of various neurological disorders, most notably chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which in professional athletes has led to premature retirement,[1] erratic behavior and even suicide. Because concussions cannot be seen on X-rays or CT scans, attempts to prevent concussions have been difficult.[2]\\r\\nThe dangers of repeated concussions have long been known for boxers and wrestlers; a form of CTE common in these two sports, dementia pugilistica (DP), was first described in 1928. An awareness of the risks of concussions in other sports began to grow in the 1990s, and especially in the mid-2000s, in both the medical and the professional sports communities, as a result of studies of the brains of prematurely deceased American football players, who showed extremely high incidences of CTE (see concussions in American football).\\r\\nAs of 2012, the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada have concussion policies.[3] Sports-related concussions are generally analyzed by athletic training or medical staff on the sidelines using an evaluation tool for cognitive function known as the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT), a symptom severity checklist, and a balance test.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConcussion symptoms can last for an undetermined amount of time depending on the player and the severity of the concussion. A concussion will affect the way a person's brain works.[5]\\r\\nThere is the potential of post-concussion syndrome, post-concussion syndrome is defined as a set of symptoms that may continue after a concussion is sustained.[6] Post-concussion symptoms can be classified into physical, cognitive, emotional, and sleep symptoms.[6] Physical symptoms include a headache, nausea, and vomiting.[6] Athletes may experience cognitive symptoms that include speaking slowly, difficulty remembering and concentrating.[6] Emotional and sleep symptoms include irritability, sadness, drowsiness, and trouble falling asleep.[6]\\r\\nAlong with the classification of post-concussion symptoms, the symptoms can also be described as immediate and delayed.[7] The immediate symptoms are experienced immediately after a concussion such as: memory loss, disorientation, and poor balance.[7] Delayed symptoms are experienced in the later stages and include sleeping disorders and behavioral changes. Both immediate and delayed symptoms can continue for long periods of time and have a negative impact on recovery.[7] According to research, 20-25% of individuals who have sustained a concussion experienced chronic, delayed symptoms.[7]\\r\\nPlaying through concussion makes people more vulnerable to getting hit again, and that is why most sports have test that trainers will perform to prevent getting hit a second time. A second blow can cause a rare condition known as second-impact syndrome, which can result in severe injury or death.[8] Second-impact syndrome is when an athlete suffers a second head injury before the brain has adequate time to heal in between concussions.[9]\\r\\nRepeated concussions have been linked to a variety of neurological disorders among athletes, including CTE, Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinsonism and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).[10][11]\\r\\nIt is estimated that as many as 1.6-3.8 million concussions occur in the US per year in competitive sports and recreational activities; this is a rough estimate, since as many as 50% of concussions go unreported.[12] Concussions occur in all sports with the highest incidence in American football, hockey, rugby, soccer, and basketball.[4] In addition to concussions caused by a single severe impact, multiple minor impacts may also cause brain injury.[13]\\r\\nMajor League Baseball's policy was first started in 2007, and injured players are examined by a team athletic trainer on the field.[15] On March 29, 2011, MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association announced that they have created various protocols for the league's concussion policy. The new policy includes four primary components:[16]\\r\\nThe National Basketball Association does not have a policy, and team procedures after concussions vary by team.[15] The NBA has a meeting to educate the players each year about concussions. Players also go through a neurological and cognitive assessment after each season.[18]\\r\\nDuring Game 2 of the 2016 NBA Finals on June 5, 2016, Kevin Love was placed in the NBA Concussion Protocol.[19]\\r\\nThe National Football League's policy was first started in 2007, and injured players are examined on field by the medical team.[15] The league's policy included the \\"NFL Sidelines Concussion Exam\\", which requires players who have taken hits to the head to perform tests concerning concentration, thinking and balance.[20] In 2011, the league introduced an assessment test, which combines a symptoms checklist, a limited neurological examination, a cognitive evaluation, and a balance assessment. For a player to be allowed to return, he must be asymptomatic.[21]\\r\\nThe National Hockey League's concussion policy began in 1997, and players who sustain concussions are evaluated by a team doctor in a quiet room.[15] In March 2011, the NHL adopted guidelines for the league's concussion policy. Before the adoptions, examinations on the bench for concussions was the minimum requirement, but the new guidelines make it mandatory for players showing concussion-like symptoms to be examined by a doctor in the locker room.[22]\\r\\n\\"We celebrate the big hit, we don't like the big head hit. There is an important distinction because we celebrate body-checking.\\"[22]\\r\\nMany children and teenagers participate in sports and extracurricular activities that create a risk of a head injury or concussion, including basketball, cheerleading, soccer, and football.[23] As a consequence, schools and youth sports groups should implement programs to reduce the risk of concussion, ensure prompt diagnosis[24] and provision of medical care, and that young participants are not endangered by a premature return to sports.[25][26]\\r\\nIn 2010, more high school soccer players suffered concussions than basketball, baseball, wrestling, and softball players combined, according to the Center for Injury Research and Policy.[27] According to a study in the JAMA Pediatrics medical journal, many girls do not get necessary care and prevention regarding concussions, and 56 percent of players (or their families) reporting concussion symptoms never sought treatment.[28]\\r\\nA growing topic is concussions in girls' soccer, predominantly among high-school girls. Studies show that girls are reporting nearly twice as many concussions as boys in the sports that they both play. The number of girls suffering concussions in soccer accounts for the second largest amount of all concussions reported by young athletes.[29]\\r\\nAccording to a 2012 study published by ScienceDirect, soccer has the highest injury rate per athlete-exposure among 7- to 13-year-old children.[30]\\r\\nAmerican football causes 250,000 concussions annually, and 20% of high-school football players experience a concussion every year.[31][32] In 2000, researchers from the Sports Medicine Research Laboratory at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill analyzed 17,549 players from 242 different schools. 888 (5.1%) of the players analyzed have at least one concussion a season, and 131 (14.7%) of them have had another concussion the year later. Division III and high-school players have a higher tendency to sustain a concussion than Division II and Division I players.[33] In 2001, the National Football League Players Association partnered with the UNC to determine whether professional football players suffer any health effects after any injuries, although the findings were criticized by the NFL for being unreliable due to being based on self-reporting by the players.[34]\\r\\nAssociation football also known as soccer is a major source of sports-related concussions around the world. Even though 50-80% of injuries in football are directed to the legs, head injuries have been shown to account for between 4 and 22% of football injuries. There is the possibility that heading the ball could damage the head, as the ball can travel at 100?km/hour; although most professional footballers have reported that they experienced head injuries from colliding with other players and the ground.[35][36] A multi-year study by the University of Colorado published in JAMA Pediatrics confirmed that athlete-to-athlete collisions that occur during heading, not impact with the ball itself, is generally the cause for concussion.[37]\\r\\nA Norwegian study consisting of current and former players of the Norway national football team found out that 3% of the active and 30% of the former players had persistent symptoms of concussions, and that 35% of the active and 32% of that former players had abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) readings.[38]\\r\\nDuring the 2006-07 English Premier League season, Czech goalkeeper Petr ?ech suffered from a severe concussion in a match between his club Chelsea and Reading. During the match, Reading midfielder Stephen Hunt hit ?ech's head with his right knee, knocking the keeper out.[39] ?ech underwent surgery for a depressed skull fracture and was told that he would miss a year of playing football. ?ech resumed his goalkeeper duties on January 20, 2007 in a match against Liverpool, now wearing a rugby helmet to protect his weakened skull.\\r\\nOn November 2, 2013 in a match between Tottenham and Everton, Tottenham goal keeper Hugo Lloris sustained a blow to the head by on -coming player Romelu Lukaku's knee. The blow left Lloris knocked out on the ground. Reluctantly manager Andre Villas Boas decided to leave the player on after regaining consciousness and having passed a medical assessment. This broke the rules of the PFA, which state that any player who has lost consciousness must be substituted.[40]\\r\\nThere has been a widespread debate on protective head gear in soccer. Known as a sport associated with intricate footwork, speed, and well-timed passes, soccer also is classified as a high- to moderate-intensity contact/collision sport, with rates of head injury and concussion similar to those seen in football, ice hockey, lacrosse, and rugby. While the benefits of helmets and other head protection are more obvious in the latter sports, the role of headgear in soccer is still unclear.[41]\\r\\nThere are clear rules from FIFA regarding what to do when a player gets a concussion. FIFA's guidelines say that a player who has been knocked unconscious should not play again that day. The rules do however allow for \\"a transient alteration of conscious level\\" following a head injury, which says that a player can return to play following assessment by medical staff. The rules also state that a player who is injured with head damage is not to be played for five days.[40]\\r\\nThe death of Dale Earnhardt at the 2001 Daytona 500, along with those of Kenny Irwin, Adam Petty and Tony Roper in 2000, and serious injuries sustained by Steve Park in a wreck in September 2001 at Darlington, led to NASCAR establishing numerous policies to assist in driver safety, such as the introduction of the Car of Tomorrow. Drivers were eventually instructed to wear both head and neck restraints, and SAFER barriers have been installed on racetrack walls, with foam-padded supports on each side of the helmet that would allow a driver's head to move in the event of a crash. Despite this, 29 identified concussions occurred between 2004 and 2012.[42]\\r\\nIn 2012, when Dale Earnhardt, Jr. suffered a concussion after being involved in a crash at the end of the Good Sam Roadside Assistance 500 at Talladega, NASCAR expressed consideration in adding baseline testing to its concussion policies. NASCAR was one of few motorsport organizations that do not have baseline testing,[43] though that ended in 2014, as baseline testing started being performed at the start of the seasons.[44]\\r\\nIn the 2005 high school basketball year, 3.6% of reported injuries were concussions, with 30.5% of concussions occurring during rebounds.[45] Incidence rates for concussions in NCAA men's basketball is lower than NCAA women's basketball, at 0.16 concussion per 1,000 athletes compared to 0.22 per 1,000 athletes respectively. The difference is found mainly in competition activity compared to practice.[46]\\r\\nDespite boxing's violent nature, a National Safety Council report in 1996 ranked amateur boxing as the safest contact sport in America.[47] However, concussions are one of the most serious injuries that can occur from boxing, and in an 80-year span from 1918 to 1998, there were 659 boxers who died from brain injury.[48] Incidence rates for concussion in boxing may frequently be miscalculated due to the fact that concussions do not always result from a knockout blow.[49] Olympic boxers deliver punches with high impact velocity but lower HIC and translational acceleration than in football impacts because of a lower effective punch mass. They cause proportionately more rotational acceleration than in football. Modeling shows that the greatest strain is in the midbrain late in the exposure, after the primary impact acceleration in boxing and football.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs many skills as gymnastics involve flipping or a blind landing, incidence of head injury increases. A 15 year study found an incidence of 1.7% for concussion and closed head injury for high school gymnasts.[46]\\r\\nIce hockey has also been known to have concussions inflict numerous players. Because of this, the NHL made hockey helmets mandatory in the 1979ÿ80 NHL season.[50] According to a data release by the National Academy of Neuropsychology's Sports Concussion Symposium, from 2006 to 2011, 765 NHL players were diagnosed with a concussion.[51] At the Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine Center Ice Hockey Summit: Action on Concussion conference in 2010, a panel made a recommendation that blows to the head are to be prohibited, and to outlaw body checking by 11- and 12-year-olds. For the 2010ÿ11 NHL season, the NHL prohibited blindside hits to the head, but did not ban hits to the face. The conference also urged the NHL and its minor entities to join the International Ice Hockey Federation, the NCAA and the Ontario Hockey League in banning any contact to the head.[52]\\r\\nThe NHL has been criticized for allowing team doctors to determine whether an injured player can return to the ice, instead of independent doctors.[53]\\r\\nConcussions are also a significant factor in rugby union, another full-contact sport. In 2011, the sport's world governing body, World Rugby (then known as the International Rugby Board, or IRB), issued a highly detailed policy for dealing with injured players with suspected concussions. Under the policy, a player suffering from a suspected concussion is not allowed to return to play in that game. Players are not cleared to play after the injury for a minimum of 21 days, unless they are being supervised in their recovery by a medical practitioner. Even when medical advice is present, players must complete a multi-step monitoring process before being cleared to play again; this process requires a minimum of six days.[54] In 2012, the IRB modified the policy, instituting a Pitchside Suspected Concussion Assessment (PSCA), under which players suspected of having suffered concussions are to leave the field for 5?minutes while doctors assess their condition via a series of questions. Players who pass the PSCA are allowed to return to play.[55]\\r\\nHowever, an incident during the third Test of the 2013 Lions tour of Australia led to criticism of the current protocols. During that match, Australian George Smith clashed heads with the Lions' Richard Hibbard and was sent to pitchside. According to ESPN's UK channel, \\"despite looking dazed and confused, Smith passed the PSCA and was back on the field minutes later.\\"[55]\\r\\nIn 2013, former Scotland international Rory Lamont charged that the current concussion protocols can easily be manipulated. A key part of the current protocols is the \\"Cogsport\\" test (also known as COG), a computer-based test of cognitive function. Each player undergoes the test before the start of a new season, and is then tested again on it after a head injury, and the results compared, to determine possible impairment. According to Lamont, some players deliberately do poorly on the pre-season test, so that they will be more likely to match or beat their previous results during play.[56]\\r\\nLamont was also critical of the PSCA, noting:\\r\\nThe Concussion bin was replaced by the head bin in 2012 with the players assessment taking 10 minutes.[57] If concussed the player must then recover by first returning to general activities in life, then progressing back to playing. Returning to play, the player must follow the Graduated Return to Play (GRTP) protocol, by having clearance from a medical professional, and no symptoms of concussion.\\r\\nNumerous reports have indicated that female athletes suffer more concussions than male athletes.[58] A December 2008 report states that 29,167 female high school soccer players in the United States suffered from concussions in 2005, compared to 20,929 male players. In high school basketball, 12,923 girls suffered from concussions while only 3,823 boys did. Girls also sustained more concussions in softball, compared to boys in baseball.[59] Female athletes also had longer recovery times than males, and also had lower scores on visual memory tests. Girls also have longer recovery times for concussions, which may be due to a greater rate of blood flow in the brain.[60]\\r\\nWomen's ice hockey was reported as one of the most dangerous sports in the NCAA, with a concussion rate of 2.72 per 1,000 player hours. Even though men's ice hockey allows body checking, while women's ice hockey does not, the rate of concussions for men is 46% lower, at 1.47 per 1,000 player hours. College football also has lower concussion rates than women's hockey, with a rate of 2.34 per 1,000.[61]\\r\\nWomens basketball is one of the womens sports with the highest risks of getting a concussion. Women have a greater risk of getting a concussion by dribbling/ball handling rather than defending. Also it was found that female college basketball players typically receive concussions during games rather than practices.[62]\\r\\nThere have been numerous attempts at preventing concussions, such as the establishment of the PACE (Protecting Athletes Through Concussion Education) program,[63] which works with the imPACT system, which is currently used by every NFL and some NHL teams.[64] In 2008, the Arena Football League tested an impact monitor created by Schutt Sports called the \\"Shockometer\\", which is a triangular device attached to the back of football helmets that has a light on the device that turns red when a concussion occurs.[65] Riddell has also created the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) and Sideline Response System (SRS) to record the frequency and severity of player hits during practices and games. On every helmet with the system, MX Encoders are implemented, which can automatically record every hit.[66] Eight NFL teams had originally planned to use the system in the 2010 season, but the NFL Players Association ultimately blocked its use.[67] Other impact-detection devices include CheckLight, by Reebok and MC10.,[68] and the online test providers ImPACT Test, BrainCheck, and XLNTbrain which establish cognitive function baselines against which the athlete is monitored over time. The CCAT online tool developed by Axon Sports is another test to assist doctors in assessing concussion.\\r\\nIn 2012, film producer Steve James created the documentary film Head Games, interviewing former NHL player Keith Primeau, and the parents of Owen Thomas, who hanged himself after sustaining brain damage during his football career at Penn.[69] The documentary also interviewed former athletes Christopher Nowinski, Cindy Parlow, and New York Times reporter Alan Schwarz, among other athletes, journalists, and medical researchers.[70]\\r\\nLeague of Denial was a 2013 book by sports reporters Mark Fainaru-Wada and Steve Fainaru about concussions within the NFL. The American documentary series Frontline covered the topic in two episodes, one based on the book and also called \\"League of Denial\\",[71] and the other called \\"Football High\\"[72] Political sports journalist Dave Zirin has also covered the topic in detail.[73]\\r\\nAubry M, Cantu R, Dvorak J, Graf-Baumann T, Johnston K, Kelly J, et al.

These closely match the CIA World Factbook figures and similarly include coastal and territorial waters for the United States, but exclude coastal and territorial waters for China.\\r\\nFurther explanation of disputed ranking: The dispute for world's third-largest country arose from the inclusion of coastal and territorial waters for the United States. This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA World Factbook and its previous iterations[10] against the information for United States on Encyclop?dia Britannica, particularly its footnote section.[7] In sum, according to older versions of the CIA World Factbook (from 1982 to 1996), the US was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610 sq km. However, in the 1997 edition, the US added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091 sq km). And then again in 2007, US added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,833,517 sq km). During this time, China's total area remained unchanged. In other words, no coastal or territorial water area was added to China's total area figure. The United States has a coastal water area of 109,362 sq km, and a territorial water area of 195,213 sq km, for a total of 304,575 sq km of additional water space. This is larger than entire countries like Italy, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Adding this figure to the US will boost it over China in ranking since China's coastal and territorial water figures are currently unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure.","input":"Which is the biggest country of the world?"},{"output":"AT&T Building","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis list of the tallest buildings in Nashville ranks skyscrapers in Nashville, in the U.S. state of Tennessee, by height.

The track measures 12.42 miles (19.99?km) over 156 turns, climbing 4,720?ft (1,440?m) from the start at Mile 7 on Pikes Peak Highway, to the finish at 14,110?ft (4,300?m), on grades averaging 7.2%.[1][2] It used to consist of both gravel and paved sections, however as of August 2011, the highway is fully paved and as a result all subsequent events will be run on asphalt from start to finish.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe race is self sanctioned and has taken place since 1916.[1][2] It is currently contested by a variety of classes of cars, trucks, motorcycles and quads. There are often numerous new classes tried and discarded year-to-year. On average there are 130 competitors. The PPIHC operates as the Pikes Peak Auto Hill Climb Educational Museum to organize the annual motorsports event.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Pikes Peak Hill Climb was promoted by Spencer Penrose, who had converted the narrow carriage road into the much wider Pikes Peak Highway.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Penrose Trophy was awarded in 1916 to Rea Lentz with a time of 20:55.60.[4][5][6] In the same year Floyd Clymer won the motorcycle class with a time of 21:58.41.[7] In 1924 the final Penrose Trophy was awarded to Otto Loesche in his Lexington Special.[8] In the years following, Glen Scultz and Louis Unser shared a rivalry and won the event 12 times between them.[5] In 1929 the popular stock car class was added to the event.[4][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing world war two, Louis Unser returned to his winning ways at Pikes Peak, winning a further three more times between 1946 and 1970, these wins were tightly contended with rival Al Rogers.[4][5] During this time the event was part of the AAA and USAC IndyCar championship.[9] In 1953, the SCCA sponsors the event, bringing with it an influx of sports cars. In this period the course record was broken every year from 1953 until 1962, this is the largest string of record breaking runs in the event's history. The majority of these records were set by Bobby Unser, the younger brother of Louis.[5] In 1954 motorcycles return to the event, the first time since its inception 1916.[6] The motorcycle overall victory that year went to Bill Meier riding a Harley-Davidson.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1971 the event was won by the first non-gasoline vehicle (propane), this was also the first overall victory from the stock car class (1970 Ford Mustang), the car was driven by the Danish-American Ak Miller.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1984 the first European racers took part in the PPIHC with Norwegian Rallycrosser Martin Schanche (Ford Escort Mk3 4x4) and French Rally driver Michle Mouton (Audi Sport quattro), thereby starting a new era for European teams in the almost unknown American hillclimb.[10] While Schanche failed to set a new track record, due to a flat right front tire, Mouton (together with her World Rally Championship co-driver Fabrizia Pons from Italy) won the Open Rally category, but failed to win the event overall. Mouton achieved the overall victory and course record in the following year.[10][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1989, an award-winning short film about the 1988 event was released by French director Jean-Louis Mourey. The film, titled Climb Dance, captured the efforts of Finnish former World Rally Champion Ari Vatanen, as he won the event in a record-breaking time with his turbocharged Peugeot 405 Turbo-16.[5][7][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe City of Colorado Springs began to pave the highway in 2002 after losing a lawsuit against the Sierra Club, which sued on account of erosion damage to streams, reservoirs, vegetation and wetlands downstream from the 1.5 million tons of road gravel deposited over several decades.[12][13] The local authority paved approximately 10% of the route each year after the order. The 2011 event was the last race with dirt sections, comprising approximately 25% of the course.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this evolutionary period of the event, the Japanese driver Nobuhiro Tajima with Suzuki cars scored 6 overall victories (2006 - 2011) and two course records.[4][10] His 2011 record was the first to break the 10 minute barrier.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nHill Climb champion Rod Millen warned at the time that paving the road would put an end to the race.[14] However, the 2012 race saw over 170 racer registrations by December 2011, compared with 46 at the same time the previous year.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 90th running of the event happened in 2012 and saw a larger field and a longer race day than ever before. This was the first time the race has been run on all asphalt leading to the breaking of several records, notably the overall record, which fell numerous times during the event finally falling to Rhys Millen the son of previous event winner Rod Millen, in the Time Attack Division. During the event Mike Ryan spun his big rig in a hairpin in a section called the \\"W\\"s, hitting the guard rail, he then managed to execute a three-point turn and continued on course, at which point he broke his old record by 5 seconds. This highlighted the change that a fully paved course made to the speed of the event.[16] The 2012 event also saw the first motorcycle to achieve a sub 10 minute time with Carlin Dunne in the 1205 Division riding a Ducati with a time of 9:52.819 which was only 1.5 seconds slower than the previous year's overall record.\\r\\n\\r\\n2013 saw the nine-minute barrier shattered by WRC legend Sbastien Loeb, with a time of 8:13.878, while Rhys Millen ended up second with 9:02.192, beating his own record by more than 44 seconds.[17] Jean-Philippe Dayrault finished third with a time of 9:42.740, and Paul Dallenbach fourth with a time of 9:46.001, making it four drivers to beat the overall record set only the previous year.\\r\\n\\r\\nElectric cars have featured on and off in the PPIHC since the early 1980s. In 1981 Joe Ball took a Sears Electric Car to the top in 32:07:410, in 1994 Katy Endicott brought her Honda to the top in 15:44.710 and in 2013 Nobuhiro Tajima broke the 10 minute barrier with a time of 9:46.530 in his E-RUNNER Pikes Peak Special. In the following years electric entries would become more common, steadily breaking their powertrain records and eventually the overall record in 2018.[5][7][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor hill-climb events and this event in particular it is reasonable to suggest that a modern, well designed electric car will be at an advantage over internal combustion engined cars. The issue of limited range does not apply to short sprints and the twisty nature of the Pikes Peak course lends itself well to the almost instant torque delivery of electric motors. In addition to this, the lowering air density of high altitudes does not reduce the power available to the driver as it does with air breathing engines.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the 2014 event was won by a gasoline powered car; second (Greg Tracy), third (Hiroshi Masuoka) and fourth (Nobuhiro Tajima) places overall were taken by electric cars.[21]\\r\\nIn 2015, electric cars placed first (Rhys Millen) and second (Nobuhiro Tajima) overall.[22][23] In an interview with Rhys Millen, he said that he had lost power to the car's rear motor pack before the halfway point. Had this not happened he had expected his run to be 30 seconds faster.[24]\\r\\nIn 2016 gasoline again took top honours but electric completed the podium taking second (Rhys Millen) and third (Tetsuya Yamano) as well as fifth (Nobuhiro Tajima) places overall.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 2018 event, an electric car set a new overall record for the first time in the event's history.

Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Nepal and another international side after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1920s cricket was introduced to Nepal for the first time by Lt.-Gen.Madan Shumsher JBR, the youngest son of Rana Prime Minister Maharaja Chandra Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana. At the time cricket was considered a \\"Gentleman's Sport\\" so involvement was limited mainly to the ruling Rana family and other members of the Nepali elite. In 1946, the Cricket Association of Nepal was formed to promote cricket amongst the aristocracy. After the introduction of democracy through the Revolution of 1951, cricket began to spread to the rest of the population. In 1961, in an effort to promote cricket to the whole of Nepal, the Cricket Association of Nepal became part of the National Sports Council. Nevertheless, the National games tended to be limited to Kathmandu until the 1980s.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nImprovements to communications and transport infrastructure in Nepal allowed the game to expand outside Kathmandu in the 1980s[18] and Nepal became an Affiliate Member of the International Cricket Council in 1988.[8] A major development programme was begun in the early 1990s, which saw regional and district tournaments being established and the increased promotion of cricket in schools.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe local population's interest in cricket increased quickly, and the demand to play was such that restrictions had to be placed on the number teams in several tournaments until more facilities could be built in the mid-1990s.[18] Nepal became an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council in 1996,[8] which was the year the national side played for the first time in the ACC Trophy in Kuala Lumpur. Nepal finished fourth out of six teams in their first round group, beating Brunei and Japan.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1998, the facilities in Nepal had improved sufficiently to allow them to host that year's ACC Trophy at grounds in Lalitpur and Kirtipur (at TU Cricket Ground) and Kathmandu.[19] Nepal themselves were unsuccessful in the tournament, going without a win.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, the country has one of the best fan followings among ICC Associate Members, but it does not have an active governing body as a result of the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) being suspended by International Cricket Council (ICC) due to unnecessary government interference.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 28 June 2014, the ICC awarded T20I status to Nepal, who took part and performed exceptionally well in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20.[9][10] Nepal had already played three T20I matches before gaining the status, as the ICC had earlier announced that all matches at the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 would have T20I status.[21] Nepal lost the status in July 2015, after failing to qualify for the 2016 ICC World Twenty20.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nNepal played their first ever Twenty20 International series against Hong Kong in November 2014 in Sri Lanka. Initially the series was scheduled for three matches[23] but only one match was played because of continuous rain and poor ground conditions.[24] Nepal lost the match but Sompal Kami put in impressive performance by scoring 40 off 31 balls,[25] coming in at No. 10. This is a world-record for the highest score made by a batsman at that position.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nNepal played their second Twenty20 International series against the Netherlands from 30 June to 3 July 2015.

The senior side had their best performance to date later in the year when they reached the semi-finals of the 2000 ACC Trophy before losing to Hong Kong at Sharjah.[28] They competed in the ICC Trophy for the first time the following year. In the tournament in Ontario, they beat Germany and Gibraltar, but a loss to eventual runners-up Namibia prevented them from progressing past the first round.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nNepal were runners-up to the UAE in the 2002 ACC Trophy in Singapore[30] and they hosted the ACC Emerging Nations Tournament in 2003, winning easily against Bhutan and the Maldives. They won so comprehensively that they were not invited back to the tournament the next time it was played in 2005.[18] Raju Khadka became the first Nepalese cricketer to score an international century, when he slammed an unbeaten 105 off just 50 balls against Bhutan in the tournament.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nNepal played first-class cricket for the first time in 2004, playing in the ICC Intercontinental Cup against the UAE and Malaysia. They beat Malaysia,[32] but drew with the UAE,[33] failing to reach the semi-final stage. Nepal finished third in the 2004 ACC Fast Track Countries Tournament, which qualified them for the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup,[34] and finished 5th in the 2004 ACC Trophy, which qualified them for the repchage tournament of the 2005 ICC Trophy. They finished third in this tournament after beating Qatar[35] in a play-off, meaning that they did not qualify for the 2005 ICC Trophy. Shakti Gauchan scored a century against Italy and stayed unbeaten on 106 off 103 balls in the tournament.[36] They beat the UAE and drew with Hong Kong in the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup, but missed out on qualification for the semi-finals by half a point. They were runners-up to the UAE in the 2005 ACC Fast Track Countries Tournament.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2006, Nepal played Namibia in Windhoek in a play-off match to decide the final team in the 2006 ICC Intercontinental Cup. Nepal needed to win outright to qualify for the main tournament, but the match was drawn after there was no play on the first day.[38] Later in the year, they toured Pakistan, playing against the Pakistan Cricket Academy[39] before playing in the 2006 ACC Trophy in Kuala Lumpur.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2006 ACC Trophy, Nepal bowled Myanmar out for just 10 off 12.1 overs after Nepal won the toss and sent Myanmar in; no batsman scored more than one, the innings included five ducks, and extras top scored with five (three leg byes and two wides). Mehboob Alam and Binod Das picked up seven wickets and three wickets respectively.[40] In reply, Nepal hit three off the first ball, followed by three wides that went for five, and then hit another three from the second legitimate delivery to win by ten wickets. Some critics called it the greatest mismatch in the history of international cricket[41] and the score of 10 is the lowest in any level of men's international cricket. They finished fourth in the tournament after losing to Afghanistan in a play-off.[42] They won the ACC Premier League in 2006.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey played in the 2007 ACC Twenty20 Cup in Kuwait, where they finished fourth in their first round group.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2008, Nepal traveled to Jersey to play in 2008 ICC World Cricket League Division Five of the World Cricket League. Mehboob Alam set the world record by taking all ten wickets in the match against Mozambique. He got his name in the Guinness World Records for becoming the first bowler to take all 10 wickets in an ICC international cricket match with limited overs.[45] Nepal topped Group A after the group qualifying matches but lost to Afghanistan in the semi-final[46] and finished third overall after defeating the USA in the playoff for third place.[47] With only the top two from this tournament qualifying for 2008 ICC World Cricket League Division Four in Tanzania later in the year, Nepal missed out on the chance to take their 2011 World Cup dream any further. Later, Nepal appeared in the 2008 ACC Trophy Elite and finished fourth after losing to the UAE in the semi-final[48] and to Afghanistan in the playoff for third place.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nNepal finished fifth in the 2009 ACC Twenty20 Cup after beating Singapore by 9 wickets in the playoff for fifth place.[50] In a group match against Kuwait, Nepal needed 7 runs off the last ball to win. Binod Bhandari, making his debut for the national team, hit a last-ball six to tie the match. Eventually Nepal won the match in bowl-out.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nNepal won their first major tournament, beating USA in the final of 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Five held at Kathmandu in February 2010.[52] Sharad Vesawkar scored a century and stayed unbeaten on 105 off 134 balls against Fiji in the tournament.[53] Nepal played very well in 2010 ACC Trophy Elite, winning all the matches in group stage and beating Malaysia in the semi-final by 8 runs[54] but lost the final against an ODI team Afghanistan by 95 runs and finished runners-up.[55] Nepal came third in 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Four, thus remaining in Division Four for 2012 ICC World Cricket League Division Four.[56] In November, Nepal appeared in 2010 Asian Games and lost against Sri Lanka in the quarter-final.[57] It was the first match Nepal had played against a Full Member nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2011, Nepal hosted the 2011 ACC Twenty20 Cup and finished fourth, thereby qualifying for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nNepal finished seventh in the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier after defeating Kenya[59] and Papua New Guinea[60] in play-offs. Shakti Gauchan took the first international hat-trick for Nepal against Denmark in the tournament.[61] In September 2012, Nepal appeared in 2012 ICC World Cricket League Division Four, where Subash Khakurel and Anil Mandal both scored century. Subash Khakurel scored 115 off 142 balls against United States[62] and Anil Mandal scored 113 off 134 balls against Denmark.[63] In a match against Malaysia, Shakti Gauchan set up Nepal's convincing victory with a new record. The left-arm orthodox spinner's figures of 10ÿ8ÿ2ÿ3 is the best economical bowling spell ever in limited over encounters.[64][65] Nepal won all the six matches of the tournament and progressed to 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three. Nepalese players won man of the match awards in all the six matches Nepal played and Basanta Regmi won the player of the tournament award after taking a total of 21 wickets in the tournament.[66] In October, Nepal competed in 2012 ACC Trophy Elite and had to share the trophy with the UAE after a thrilling tied final in Sharjah Cricket Stadium, UAE on 12 October 2012. UAE posted 241, a target that looked in Nepal's sight after their 94-run opening stand. However, they lost wickets consistently, and eventually needed 12 off the last over with just two wickets in hand. Shakti Gauchan smacked Shadeep Silva's left-arm for a six, but could manage only one run off the last ball, hence ending a splendid final match in a tie.[67] Skipper Paras Khadka scored an unbeaten 106 off just 77 balls against Kuwait, his maiden century for Nepal, in the tournament.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nNepal competed in 2013 ACC Twenty20 Cup held at home grounds in Kirtipur and Lalitpur. Nepal easily marched towards the final of the tournament with high class performance from their captain, Paras Khadka, and the team thrashed the UAE by 6 wickets.[69] Nepal had earlier qualified for 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, reaching the semi-final of the tournament. Nepal had to be satisfied with runners-up status after losing to an ODI team Afghanistan by 7 wickets.[70] The Nepalese team was supported by a huge fan following throughout this tournament with an average turnout of 15,000 ÿ 20,000 (about 25,000 in the semi-final and final) during their matches while hundreds of thousands watched live on television ÿ undoubtedly the largest public support outside the Test-playing nations.[71] Nepal won the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three held in Bermuda and qualified for the 2014 World Cup Qualifier.[72] Nepal also played in 2013 ACC Emerging Teams Cup, where under-23 age level teams of the four Test nations ÿ Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka took part along with the UAE, Afghanistan and the hosts Singapore.[73] Nepal finished third in 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier held in UAE[74] and qualified for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, defeating Hong Kong off the last ball of the thrilling quarter-final.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nNepal missed out on qualification for the 2015 World Cup, finishing ninth in the 2014 World Cup Qualifier in New Zealand in January.[76] Nepal were the best of the three associate teams on display in Group A of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. They comprehensively beat Hong Kong,[77] held their own with the bat against Bangladesh[78] and pulled off a strong win against Afghanistan,[79] their first since 2004 in any format against their old rivals.[80] Nepal's bowlers did not bowl a single wide or no ball throughout the tournament.[81] Nepal were also the only team to not concede 140 in an innings in the tournament.[82] Nepal finished third in the 2014 ACC Premier League, where they beat ODI teams UAE[83] and Hong Kong, and qualified for the 2014 ACC Championship.[84] In September, Nepal participated in the 2014 Asian Games but failed to qualify beyond quarter-finals.[85] Nepal won the 2014 ICC World Cricket League Division Three held in Malaysia and qualified for the 2015 ICC World Cricket League Division Two.[86] Gyanendra Malla scored his maiden century, 114 off 125 balls, against Singapore in the tournament.[87] In November, Nepal toured Sri Lanka, as Sri Lanka Cricket approved a request from the Asian Cricket Council to support the region's Non-Test playing countries,[88] where they played two three-day matches against Sri Lanka Cricket Combined XI.[89][90] and a Twenty20 International series against Hong Kong.\\r\\n\\r\\nNepal finished fourth in the 2015 ICC World Cricket League Division Two in Namibia[91] and qualified for the 2015ÿ17 ICC World Cricket League Championship.[92] But Nepal failed to secure promotion to Division One and qualification to 2015ÿ17 ICC Intercontinental Cup after finishing third in the round-robin stage.[93][94] Basanta Regmi became the first bowler to take 100 wickets in the World Cricket League. He achieved this feat after taking 2 wickets against Netherlands in the tournament.[95] On 11 April 2015, Nepal hosted a 63-over (31.3 overs per side) tribute match in honour of the Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes who was batting on 63 when he was struck by a bouncer. The match was played at the TU Cricket Ground, Kirtipur between Team Red, combined of players of Nepal and Australia and Team Blue, composed of all Nepalese players.[96] In June, Nepal toured Netherlands to play a Twenty20 International series against the home team. Then Nepal appeared in the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier held in Ireland and Scotland, where the team finished seventh in the Group A,[97] thus failing to qualify for the second consecutive ICC World Twenty20.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nNepal finished second in 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Two to earn a place in the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. On March 15, 2018 Nepal claimed One Day International (ODI) status for the first time with their win over Papua New Guinea in the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier 9th place play off encounter.[15] Due to gaining ODI status, Nepal also regained Twenty20 International (T20I) status. After gaining ODI status, Nepal's captain at the Cricket World Cup Qualifier, Paras Khadka, said that they want to gain Test status, which he believes will take between eight and ten years to achieve.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational Match Summary?ÿ Nepal[100][101]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost ODI runs for Nepal[102]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost ODI wickets for Nepal[103]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nODI record versus other nations[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecords complete to ODI #4028.

An investment group consisting of William DeWitt, Jr., Fred Hanser, the Klingaman Group, and others, owns the St. Louis Cardinals, who bought the team from Anheuser-Busch (AB) in 1996.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChris von der Ahe was the first owner of the Cardinals franchise, then known as the Brown Stockings and pioneered many of the elements commonly associated with the sport at the game. A German immigrant who made his way as a grocer and saloon owner, he saw potential in the sport without otherwise having any other background in it.[2] He also became a polarizing figure with his employees and rivals: Von der Ahe was a flamboyant and magnanimous entrepreneur who gained enormous popularity in St. Louis and his team but was reviled by rival owners. He was marked by a willingness to charge lower admission rates, encouraging play on Sundays, and opening beer concessions at the stadium, a practice that the National League prohibited during Von der Ahe's time. He also was one of the few owners to make a profit during his time, in contrast with his rival owners, whose American Association eventually collapsed due to bankruptcy. [3] National League owners such Albert Spalding bristled at his promotional techniques that became common to today's game. Charlie O. Finley, Larry McPhail, and Bill Veeck eventually employed sideshow attractions, like the \\"stadium club\\" and the shoot-the-chute.[4]\\r\\nIn 1881, after the Browns profited $25,000 from playing a season's worth of informal contests, Von der Ahe bought out the team's remaining stockholders for $1,800.[5] With baseball's already existing popularity in Cincinnati and increasing popularity in other cities such as Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Baltimore, the time was right for a new league. Late that same year, along with other owners and financiers, Von der Ahe formed the American Association of Base Ball Clubs with the Brown Stockings.[6] In 1899, von der Ahe, once the most successful owner in the AA, was forced to sell the Browns due to bankruptcy.[3]\\r\\nFirst making his mark as a local automobile dealer, Sam Breadon first purchased a minority stake in the Cardinals in 1917 for $2,000, thus commencing 30 total years as owner of the Cardinals. Three years later, Breadon bought out the majority stock in the club to become the principal owner of the Cardinals and extinguished the futility that dredged the Cardinals' first three decades in the National League. Between 1926 and 1946, the Cardinals won six World Series titles and nine National League pennants.\\r\\nBreadon was noted for a very conservative nature with his finances, highly demanding nature of his teams' success on the field, and bold moves otherwise. When he became minority owner, the Cardinals were $150,000 in debt.[7] In 1925, he moved Branch Rickey from the dugout to the front office and promoted second baseman Rogers Hornsby to player-manager. Breadon also convinced cross-town American League rival St. Louis Browns owner Phil Ball to allow the Cardinals to move into Sportsman's Park. This allowed him to sell the dilapidated Robison Field property for a total of $275,000 to the city and a trolley company, clear their debts, and, with Rickey's oversight, establish an official, contractually-linked minor league farm system. This strategy developed into the current minor league system and the Cardinals used it to circumvent the practice of bidding against the more affluent Major League teams such as the New York Yankees and New York Giants for players from minor league teams, which at that time were unaffiliated. Although Minor League Baseball has existed as long as baseball has been organized, it was the first player development system of its kind in any professional sport.[8]\\r\\nBetween 1920 and 1947, the Cardinals compiled a record of 2,470-1,830 for a winning percentage of .574.[9] When he sold the Cardinals to Fred Saigh and Robert Hannegan in 1947, the price was $3 million, at the time the largest transaction in baseball history.[7][10]\\r\\nAt the end of the 1947 baseball season, Saigh got wind that longtime Cardinals owner Sam Breadon wanted to sell. Breadon faced two problems. He was ill with prostate cancer, and he had been unable to find land on which to build a planned new ballpark. The Cardinals had rented Sportsman's Park from the city's other major league team, the American League Browns, since 1920. Although they had long since surpassed the Browns as the city's most popular team, Breadon wanted to build a park of his own. He had set aside $5 million to build a park, and was facing the end of a five-year deadline to build it before having to pay taxes on that money. Saigh persuaded Breadon to sell the Cardinals to him, with the assurance that he wouldn't have to pay taxes on his $5 million fund. To further put him at ease, Saigh brought in Robert Hannegan as a minority partner. Hannegan was a prominent St. Louis businessman, former United States Postmaster General, and confidante of President Harry Truman. The $4 million deal closed in late 1947.\\r\\nSaigh inherited a team in transition. The Cardinals, though then just one year removed from their ninth National League pennant and sixth World Series championship since 1926, had begun to decay as an organization. Five years before, Breadon had forced out legendary general manager Branch Rickey, who had quickly resurfaced with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Meanwhile, the Browns, under new owner Bill Veeck, began a concerted effort to drive the Cardinals out of town.[11]\\r\\nIn January, 1949, Hannegan, suffering from poor health, his share o[12] f the team to Saigh. Hannegan died that October of heart disease. As sole owner, Saigh's notable actions included leading other baseball owners to oust (by not renewing his contract) Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler in December, 1950 [13] and proposing revenue-sharing of local television revenues.[14]\\r\\nHowever, the tax dodge Saigh used soon came to light, as well as other questionable practices on his part.[11] Saigh was indicted on federal charges of evading $49,260 in income taxes between 1946 and 1949. In January 1953, he pleaded no contest to two counts involving more than $19,000 in tax underpayments, and was sentenced to 15 months in prison.[15] He served five months at the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, leaving in November 1953 when he was given parole for good behavior.\\r\\nIn February 1953, under pressure from Commissioner Ford Frick, Saigh put the Cardinals up for sale.[15] Saigh would have almost certainly been thrown out of baseball if he hadn't sold the team. For a time, no credible offers surfaced from St. Louis interests, making it seem likely that the team would be purchased by someone interested in moving them to another city. The most promising offer came from a consortium of businessmen in Houston, Texas. The Cardinals owned the Houston Buffaloes of the Texas League; under major-league rules of the time, that meant they also held the major-league rights to Houston. The only question was whether Buffalo Stadium could be upgraded to major-league standards.[16]\\r\\nHowever, just before he was due to reach a final agreement with the Houston group, Saigh sold the Cardinals to Anheuser-Busch, the St. Louis-based brewery. Although Anheuser-Busch's offer was far less ($3.75 million) than what out-of-town suitors had on the table, Anheuser-Busch president Gussie Busch persuaded Saigh that civic pride was more important than money. This all but assured that the Cardinals would stay in St. Louis. Shortly afterward, the Cardinals bought Sportsman's Park from the Browns. With their remaining leverage gone, it was the Browns who left town by the end of the season, becoming the Baltimore Orioles.)\\r\\nAs with other periods of the Cardinals' transaction history, doubt loomed as to whether the purchaser would keep the team in St. Louis, due to the city's status as a \\"small market\\", which appear to handicap a club's competitiveness. Such was the case when Sam Breadon sold the Cardinals in 1947: then-NL President Ford Frick had proposed to Breadon the idea of moving the Cardinals to Chicago.[17] When AB placed the Cardinals for sale in 1995, they publicly expressed intention to find a buyer who would keep the club in St. Louis.[18] In March 1996, AB sold the team for $147 million to a partnership headed by Southwest Bank's Drew Baur, Hanser and DeWitt, Jr.[17] Civic Center Redevelopment, a subsidiary of AB, held the parking garages and adjacent property and also transferred them to the Baur ownership group.[19] Baur's group then sold the garages to another investment group, making the net cost of the franchise purchase about $100 million, making the net purchase price about $10 million less than Financial World's value of the team at the time $110 million.[18][20]\\r\\nCurrent Cincinnati Reds owner Bob Castellini and brothers Thomas Williams and W. Joseph Williams Jr. each once owned a stake in the Cardinals dating back to the Baur-DeWitt group's purchase of the team. To allow their purchase of the Reds in 2005, the rest of the group bought out Castellini's and the Williams brothers' shares, totaling an estimated 13%. At that time, the Forbes valued the Cardinals at about $370 million.[21] However, after reabsorbing that stake into the remainder of the group, they decided to make it available to new investors in 2010. Amid later allegations that the Cardinals owed the city profit shares, DeWitt revealed that their profitability had not reached the threshold to trigger that obligation.[22]\\r\\nAs of 2013, according to Forbes, the Cardinals are the tenth-most valuable franchise of 30 in MLB at $716.2 million, with a revenue of $239 million. They play \\"in the best single-team baseball market in the country and are among the league's leaders in television ratings and attendance every season.\\"[23] Concurrent with the growth of Major League Baseball, the Cardinals value has increased significantly since the Baur-DeWitt purchase. In 2000, the franchise was valued at $219 million,[24] a growth rate of 327%. Since 2012, the franchise's value grew 21%.\\r\\nValuation per Forbes.\\r\\n1 Based on current stadium deal (unless new stadium is pending) without deduction for debt, other than stadium debt.\\r\\n? ?

Branch Rickey was the Cardinals first official GM ÿÿ however, his role initially called for him to function more as a business manager ÿÿ as he pioneered certain functions attributed to the contemporary GM, such as developing the forerunner of the minor league farm system that all Major League Baseball franchises use today. Rickey is also the longest tenured GM in franchise history with 23 years. Notable Cardinals who have served as GM but gained their notoriety through other roles while with the Cardinals include former outfielder Stan Musial and manager Whitey Herzog. Rickey, William Walsingham, Jr., Musial, Joe McDonald, Walt Jocketty and Mozeliak each won at least one World Series as Cardinals GM. Rickey won the most with four. Hall of Fame inductees who have served as GM for the Cardinals include Herzog, Musial and Rickey.","input":"Who owns the st louis cardinals baseball team?"},{"output":"JavaScript","context":"RPG Maker, known in Japan as RPG Tsukru (RPG֭λ, sometimes romanized as RPG Tkool), is the name of a series of programs for the development of role-playing video games (RPGs), created by the Japanese group ASCII, succeeded by Enterbrain. The Japanese name, Tsukru, is a pun mixing the Japanese word tsukuru (F), which means \\"make\\" or \\"create\\", with tsru (֭λ), the Japanese transcription of the English word \\"tool\\".[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe RPG Maker series has been released primarily in Japan, with later versions also released in East Asia, North America, Europe, and Australia.[2] It is a popular game development engine, with hundreds of games created using RPG Maker released on Steam every year, including hundreds of commercial games.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nRPG Maker is a program that allows users to create their own role-playing video games. Most versions include a tile set based map editor (tilesets are called chipsets in pre-XP versions), a simple scripting language for scripting events, and a battle editor. All versions include initial premade tilesets, characters, and events which can be used in creating new games. One feature of the PC Versions of RPG Maker programs is that a user can create new tilesets and characters, and add any new graphics the user wants.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite being geared towards creating role-playing video games, the engine also has the capability to create games of other genres, such as adventure games (see Yume Nikki) or visual novels with minimal tweaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Enterbrain, RPG Tsukru Dante 98, released on December 17, 1992, was the first software of the RPG Maker series,[4][5] although there were a few versions of RPG making software by ASCII preceding it, dating back to 1988[citation needed]. This, along with its follow-up RPG Tsukru Dante 98 II, was made for NEC PC-9801, and games created with these programs can be played on a Windows computer with emulators called Dante for Windows and D2win, respectively.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nRPG Maker 95 was the first Microsoft Windows-based RPG Maker software. Despite being an early version, RPG Maker 95 has both a higher screen resolution, and higher sprite and tile resolution than the several following versions.\\r\\n\\r\\nRPG Maker 2000, also referred to as RM2k, was the second release of RPG Maker for Microsoft Windows and is the most popular and used RPG Maker so far.[citation needed] While it is possible to do more with RM2k, it uses lower resolution sprites and tiles than RPG Maker 95. However, it does not have a noticeable limit of 'sprites'. Unlike RM95, which can only use one 'set', RM2k can use an unlimited number of sprite sheets with specific sizes for each type.  The tilesets also have a similar non-limitation. However, because tiles must be entered into a database, there is a limit on tiles.  This limit however is rarely a problem (normally 5000), and even when it is, an unofficial patch exists which can bump most limits much higher at the risk of potential game corruption. It doesn't support text output and can program only 2 buttons, Z and X. There is text in dialog boxes, by manner of overlaying sprites, or maps lain with text. But not plainly on the screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nRPG Maker 2003, also referred to as RM2k3, and sometimes RM2k/3, is largely an improvement of RM2k. RM2k games can be ported to RM2k3 (but not back to RM2k, the conversion is permanent), and most resources are interchangeable.  The main difference is the introduction of a side-view battle system similar to that found in Final Fantasy games on the Super NES. This was the first version made by Enterbrain, which had previously been a part of ASCII.\\r\\n\\r\\nRPG Maker XP, also referred to as RMXP, is the first RPG Maker which can use Ruby, making it the most powerful, programming-wise. However, many normal, simplified features present in RM2k(3) have been removed. Most of these features, however, have been programmed with Ruby, and distributed online. RMXP runs at 1024x768 resolution (though games made in it run at 640x480), while offering four times the playable area of its predecessors. Additionally, it allows greater user control over sprite size (there is no specific image size regulation for sprite sheets) and other aspects of game design. This more open-ended arrangement, coupled with the inclusion of the Ruby Game Scripting System (RGSS), makes RPG Maker XP more versatile than older versions in the series, at the cost of a steeper learning curve. Upon the release of Windows Vista, many users experienced compatibility problems, although the fix was relatively simple.[citation needed].\\r\\nXP used a front-view non-sprite battle system that allowed for the use of Battle backgrounds (Battlebacks).  Both characters and enemies had static battle sprites, and the interface was quite simple.\\r\\n\\r\\nRPG Maker VX, also referred to as RMVX, its Japanese release date was Dec. 27 2007, and official release date in America was February 29, 2008. In this new maker, the interface is more user-friendly, allowing new users to create games with ease. The framerate was increased to 60 frames per second, providing much smoother animation in comparison to RMXP's often-choppy 40fps. The programming language Ruby is still implemented, and the game's default programming has been overhauled to allow more freedom to those scripting in new features. New editor and a new RTP are included, this time in a much simpler \\"blocky\\" style. The battle system is comparable to that of the Dragon Quest series or its predecessor RM2k, with a frontal view of the battlefield and detailed text descriptions of each action taken. One notable disadvantage from the previous version, however, is the lack of support for multiple tilesets when mapping, leaving the player with only a finite number of unique tiles with which to depict all the game's environments. Multiple player-made workarounds exist, but this remains a sore point among many RMVX users.\\r\\n\\r\\nRPG Maker VX Ace, also known as VXAce or simply \\"Ace\\", was released by Enterbrain in Japan on December 15, 2011.[7] It was released in the United States on March 15, 2012 as a digital download. It was later made available through Steam, and is also now available as a physical CD.[8] RPG Maker VX Ace is essentially an overhauled version of RPG Maker VX, and removes the issue with multiple tilesets. Battle backgrounds were re-introduced, and are separated into top and bottom halves. Spells, skills, and items can all now have their own damage and recovery formulas, although a quick calculation method reminiscent of the older RPG Makers is available. The VX RTP was redesigned for VX Ace, and a new soundtrack featuring higher quality techno-pop tracks was included. With the release of VX Ace came a large quantity of DLC Resource Packages, officially offered by Enterbrain, and also available through Steam.\\r\\n\\r\\nReleased by Degica on October 23, 2015, RPG Maker MV includes a number of improvements over previous versions, having multiplatform support, side-view battles, and high resolution features.[9] It is also the first engine in the series to use JavaScript instead of Ruby, with the addition of plugins. Completed games can also be played on a mobile device. RPG Maker MV also goes back to layered tilesets, a feature that was removed in RPG Maker VX and VX Ace.[10] It will also be released on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in Japan on November 15, 2018, and worldwide in 2019.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nVictor Reetz created the first console RPG Maker, RPG Tsukru Super Dante, which debuted in 1995 for the Super Famicom, as a port of RPG Tsukru Dante 98.[5] RPG Tsukru Super Dante was later broadcast via the Super Famicom's Satellaview accessory.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, RPG Maker was released for the Sony PlayStation, however, only a limited number of copies were made for releases outside of Japan. The software allowed user-made characters, and monsters through Anime Maker which was separate from the RPG Maker, which required saving to an external memory card. However, there was a limit to how many user-made sprites and monsters could be used in RPG Maker. Also, in Anime Maker, the user could create larger sprites for a theater-type visual novel in which the player could animate and control characters, but these sprites were much larger and unusable in RPG Maker.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe RPG Maker interface was somewhat user-friendly, and battles were front-view style only. Item, Monster, Skill/Magic, and Dungeons had a small limit cap, as did the effects of any given Item, Magic or Skill (9,999). Items were all inclusive; Weapons and Armors were created in the Items interface. The types of items were as follows: None (mainly used for Key Items), Weapon, Armor, Key (up to eight sub types), Magic (for binding Magic created in the Magic interface to an item), Healing, and Food (which raises stats and EXP, or experience points in which this particular software is the only one of the series to do so natively).\\r\\n\\r\\nEvents were a separate save file from the System file, and are referred to as Scenario files. This is how the user could make multiple parts to one game, provided the user had enough memory cards and card space to create the files.\\r\\n\\r\\nA version for the Nintendo 3DS was released by NIS America on June 27, 2017. While it remains portable on a small screen, users can create games on-the-go and also download games to play as well. The game received some criticism, with NintendoWorldReport writing that \\"Ultimately, its hard for me to recommend RPG Maker Fes to anyone but the most hardcore of RPG fans that have always dreamed of creating their own game.\\"[12]  Games completed can be uploaded to the world for those to download and play on their own systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, few early RPG Maker versions had official English releases. Each Windows version has, however, been subject to unlicensed distribution through the internet in some form or other.[13] RPG Maker 95, as well as translation patches for the Super Famicom titles RPG Maker Super Dante and RPG Maker 2, were translated and distributed by a group called KanjiHack. In 1999, KanjiHack closed upon receiving a cease-and-desist e-mail from ASCII's lawyers. RPG Maker 95 was re-released with a more complete translation under the name RPG Maker 95+ by a Russian programmer, under the alias of Don Miguel,[14] who later translated and released RPG Maker 2000. Later versions, RPG Maker 2003, and RPG Maker XP, were similarly translated and distributed by a programmer under the alias of RPG Advocate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first official English release of the PC series was of RPG Maker XP on September 16, 2005. The next two versions of the software, RPG Maker VX and RPG Maker VX Ace both received official English releases. Since 2010 English versions of RPG Maker have been published by Degica, who have also officially released English versions of the older titles RPG Maker 2000 and RPG Maker 2003.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first official English language of a console version was the PlayStation version in 2000, simply called RPG Maker, by Agetec. Agetec also localised RPG Maker 2 and RPG Maker 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its first release, the series has been used to create numerous titles, both free and commercial. According to PC Gamer, it has become \\"the go-to tool for aspiring developers who want to make a game and sell it\\", due to being \\"the most accessible game engine around\\".[3] A number of developers who have created notable games via an entry in the series include:\\r\\n\\r\\nBy August 2005, the series had sold more than two million copies worldwide.[4] In addition to games, the series has been used for other purposes, such as studies involving students learning mathematics through the creation of role-playing games,[16] and programming[17]","input":"What coding language does rpg maker mv use?"},{"output":"a particular type of rotary bearing","context":"A thrust bearing is a particular type of rotary bearing. Like other bearings they permit rotation between parts, but they are designed to support a predominately axial load.\\r\\nThrust bearings come in several varieties.\\r\\nThrust bearings are commonly used in automotive, marine, and aerospace applications. They are also used in the main and tail rotor blade grips of RC (radio controlled) helicopters.\\r\\nThrust bearings are used in cars because the forward gears in modern car gearboxes use helical gears which, while aiding in smoothness and noise reduction, cause axial forces that need to be dealt with.\\r\\nThrust bearings are also used with radio antenna masts to reduce the load on an antenna rotator.\\r\\nOne specific thrust bearing in an automobile is the clutch \\"throw out\\" bearing, sometimes called the clutch release bearing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFluid-film thrust bearings were invented by Albert Kingsbury, who discovered the principle in the course of bearing and lubrication investigations commencing in 1888 while a student. His first experimental bearing was tested in 1904. He filed for a patent in 1907, and it was granted in 1910.[2] The first Kingsbury bearing in hydroelectric service, one of its major applications, was installed at the Holtwood Generating Station in 1912. It remains in full use today.\\r\\nThrust bearings were independently invented by Australian engineer George Michell (pronounced Mitchell) who patented his invention in 1905.\\r\\nFluid thrust bearings contain a number of sector-shaped pads, arranged in a circle around the shaft, and which are free to pivot. These create wedge-shaped regions of oil inside the bearing between the pads and a rotating disk, which support the applied thrust and eliminate metal-on-metal contact.\\r\\nKingsbury and Michell's invention was notably applied to the thrust block in ships. The small size (one-tenth the size of old bearing designs), low friction and long life of Kingsbury and Michell's invention made possible the development of more powerful engines and propellers. They were used extensively in ships built during World War I, and have become the standard bearing used on turbine shafts in ships and power plants worldwide.

Airing in the U.S. from Monday to Friday nights, it is taped in front of a studio audience Monday through Thursday afternoons ÿ during weeks in which first-run episodes are scheduled to air ÿ at CBS Television City in Los Angeles, California in Studio 56, directly above the Bob Barker Studio (Studio 33). It is produced by Fulwell 73 and CBS Television Studios.\\r\\nCorden was announced as the show's new host on September 8, 2014, succeeding Craig Ferguson.[1] Originally scheduled to premiere on March 9, 2015, CBS later pushed back its premiere to March 23, 2015, in order to use the NCAA basketball tournament as a means of promoting Corden's debut.[2]\\r\\nOn April 4, 2017, it was confirmed that Corden would bring The Late Late Show to the UK for three special episodes taped at the Central Hall Westminster. It was the third time in the history of the programme that it aired from another country, with Ferguson taking his incarnation to Paris, France in 2011[3] and Scotland in 2012.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCorden said he was \\"thrilled and honored\\" and found it \\"hugely exciting ... to host such a prestigious show\\".[5] CBS Entertainment chairman Nina Tassler said in a statement that Corden is a warm, charming and original performer whose \\"diverse range of creative instincts and performance talent\\" make him a \\"rare entertainment force\\". Tassler cited Corden's work in such media as theatre, film and television, and called him \\"loved and respected\\" in all of them.[6] The show continues to be filmed at CBS Television City in Los Angeles.[7] Corden made a surprise guest appearance on predecessor Ferguson's programme on December 16, 2014, two days prior to Ferguson's last broadcast as host, during which the two briefly discussed Corden taking over the show.[8] He also appeared on an episode hosted by Judd Apatow to job shadow, stating he wanted to \\"learn from his mistakes\\".[9]\\r\\nUnlike his predecessors, Corden's Late Late Show has a house band, nicknamed \\"Karen\\",[10] led by Reggie Watts who also acts as the show's announcer. Watts also performs as lead vocals, keyboards, beatboxing, and programmer.[11] The other personnel in the band are Tim Young on lead guitars, Steve Scalfatti on keyboards, Hagar Ben Ari on bass, and Guillermo E. Brown on drums. The show's title sequence, which was supposed to be directed by J.J. Abrams, was filmed by the visual firm of Trollb?ck + Company. Watts and the Late Late Show Band composed the theme song.[12] According to a report in the Daily Mail: \\"Corden hopes the credits will show him riding a BMX bike around Los Angeles, with other on-screen talent joining him as he reaches the CBS studio.\\"[13] The show's executive producers are Rob Crabbe and Ben Winston.[9] The final product being James Corden and Reggie Watts going around LA in a Low Rider, LED bike, and some graphic and light painting with a Pixelstick. Trollb?ck + Company put this statement below the video: \\"James Corden and Reggie Watts put the LA LA back into Late Late in a series fun vignettes filmed around Los Angeles for the identity of the new CBS Late Late Show. James originally wanted JJ Abrams to film him and Reggie scored to a Mark Ronson track. We were of course honored to take JJ's place as he was a bit busy filming a blockbuster! We managed to shoot everything in one night with LED bikes, a Lowrider, and a Pixelstick setting an eclectic visual tone for this experimental new show.\\"[14]\\r\\nWhile an opening monologue is a staple of the late night talk show genre, Corden suggested initially that as he is not a stand-up comedian, he would also be using alternatives to the traditional joke-heavy monologue.[15] However, the show has retained the monologue though it is shorter and not as important an element as the monologue on other late night shows.[16]\\r\\nThe show also uses an interview format similar to that of British chat show The Graham Norton Show, in which all of the night's guests appear on stage simultaneously.[17] Guests do not walk on stage from the wings but emerge from the back of the studio and walk through the audience rows. As is more typical in British talk shows, the host sits to the left of the guests, a reversal of the traditional American layout. Corden also does not sit behind a desk, unlike other late night hosts, but in a swivel chair.[16]\\r\\nTom Hanks and Mila Kunis were Corden's first guests on March 23, 2015, for the debut episode featuring Corden and Hanks acting and singing their way through a retrospective of Hanks' career.[18] Later, after a prompt by Hanks, Corden appeared to score a coup by getting Mila Kunis to admit that she and Ashton Kutcher are married, but a source later claimed she was merely joking.[19] The episode scored 1.66?million viewers, the show's biggest Monday rating in more than three years.[20]\\r\\nFirst-run episodes aired every weeknight through the May 2015 sweeps period; then, beginning the week of May 25, the show scaled back its production schedule to four first-run episodes per week (differing from the previous iterations of the program, which produced Friday episodes, either the day of broadcast or farther in advance on the tape date of the Thursday edition), with the Friday episode consisting of a rebroadcast of a recent episode, as has become common with several other late-night talk shows (with the exception of The Late Show and The Tonight Show, which continue to produce first-run episodes on that night, and many airing on cable, which almost universally do not air episodes on Fridays at all). Even with Corden's debut week, Late Night with Seth Meyers still beat The Late Late Show in the ratings during the 12:35?a.m. time slot, with Meyers continuing to dominate that slot on a weekly basis.\\r\\nThe May 20, 2015 episode, which followed the finale of Late Show with David Letterman, was the highest rated episode of The Late Late Show in the history of the franchise with an audience of 4 million viewers and a rating of 2.5.,[21] despite starting 20 minutes late due to Letterman's show running over its scheduled end time.[22] The episode featured Corden and Sting outside of the Ed Sullivan Theater singing \\"Every Breath You Take\\" in the show's cold open and a monologue with a Top Ten List among other tributes to Letterman.[23]\\r\\nIn India the show is aired at 1PM(IST), 8PM(IST) and 11:56PM(IST) on Zee Cafe and Zee Cafe HD.(repeats included)\\r\\nIn the UK and Ireland since 2016 the show airs on Sky's 'On Demand' service as well as Now TV with each episode available the day after its US broadcast.

The restaurant is sandwiched between two other commercial buildings, one of which houses \\"It's Your Funeral Home and Crematorium\\", whose owner Mort is a regular at the restaurant. One of the show's running gags involves the other building, which is generally vacant during episodes but has been home to such businesses as \\"Uncle Marty's Breast Pumps\\", \\"Extra Moist Yoga\\", \\"That's A-Door-A-Bell Doorbells\\", and \\"Tire-Rhea\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nSuccess is not easy, as Bob must compete with several other eateries for business. His biggest rival is Jimmy Pesto, who owns an Italian restaurant called Jimmy Pestos Pizzeria, which is located directly across the street. It attracts many more customers than Bob's Burgers, creating tension between the two owners. Jimmy particularly enjoys humiliating Bob, an example being in the episode Burgerboss, when he got a higher score on an arcade machine than Bob, who had rented the game, and taunted him by putting \\"BOB SUX\\" as his initials. The hatred between Bob and Jimmy is full of humor. Although they dislike each other, Bob's daughter, Tina, shows obsessive interest toward Pesto's eldest son, Jimmy Junior. However, it is often unclear how Jimmy Jr. feels toward Tina, although he always tries to get her back when she expresses interest in other boys. He approves of her erotic friend fiction, starring himself, in \\"Bad Tina\\", but tends to forget they are dating because he is always occupied with activities, such as spending time with best friend and wrestling buddy, Zeke, and dancing by himself.[clarification needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBob's restaurant also has seen its fair share of bad luck. For example, in the show's opening, the property falls victim to a fire, an infestation of vermin, and a broken front window caused by a car knocking down a utility pole. In spite of all this, Bob does have a small but loyal group of regular customers, including the aforementioned Mort, and Teddy, a local handyman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Belcher family runs a hamburger restaurant. Bob (H. Jon Benjamin) is the restaurant's owner and husband to the fun-loving and happy-go-lucky Linda (John Roberts). Their three children are Tina (Dan Mintz), the oldest, Gene (Eugene Mirman), the only boy, and Louise (Kristen Schaal), the youngest. All three children help at the restaurant to some extent. Louise is somewhat of a precocious menace and an instigator of many of the debacles that face the Belcher family. Tina is awkward, but full of heart, and muddles her way through her pubescent experiences, such as leg waxing and strong fixations on neighborhood boys. Gene is the more cheery and carefree type and aspires to be a great musician.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are various recurring characters in the series including Jimmy Pesto, Sr. (Jay Johnston), Bob's primary business rival who owns an Italian-themed restaurant across the street, and his sons Jimmy Jr. (Benjamin), Tina's love interest, and hyperactive and childish twins Andy (Laura Silverman) and Ollie (Sarah Silverman), who are friends of Louise. They get along well, despite the enmity between their fathers. Other friends, and frenemies, of the Belcher kids include Zeke (Bobby Tisdale), Tammy (Jenny Slate), Jocelyn (John Roberts), and Regular-Sized Rudy (Brian Huskey).  Mr. Frond (David Herman) is the guidance counselor at their school.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther recurring characters include customers Teddy (Larry Murphy) and Mort (Andy Kindler), as well as Linda's eccentric sister Gayle (Megan Mullally), and the Belchers' sometimes-meddling landlord, Calvin Fischoeder (Kevin Kline) and his brother Felix (Zach Galifianakis). Bob is frequently antagonized by health inspector Hugo (Sam Seder), Linda's ex-fianc who holds a grudge against Bob and constantly schemes to get the restaurant shut down, though his plans are often revealed to the Belchers by his easy-going assistant, Ron (Ron Lynch).\\r\\n\\r\\nCreator Loren Bouchard said Bob's Burgers came about because Fox's animation brand centers mostly on family, but he also wanted to dabble in workplace comedy.[17] The show has generally been viewed as a spiritual successor to King of the Hill, which carried less emphasis on shock comedy and focused more on character-driven humor; Bob's Burgers executive producer Jim Dauterive worked on King of the Hill for nearly its entire run.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the show was aired, the team created a proof of concept so Fox Broadcasting Company knew what to expect if they bought the show. Jay Howell had his art featured in a test animation based on Bob forgetting about his and Linda's wedding anniversary. This proof of concept eventually turned into the pilot episode. It had the same synopsis as the official pilot (aired in 2011) but had both cosmetic and substantial differences. These included:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original pilot can be seen on the DVD release of the first season, released on April 17, 2012.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nBob's Burgers first appeared on the development slate at Fox on August 6, 2009.[20] On December 1, 2009, Fox ordered 13 episodes for the first season.[21] On May 17, 2010, Fox placed the series on the primetime slate for the 2010ÿ11 television season.[22] A special preview aired on Thanksgiving on November 25, 2010.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nCreator Loren Bouchard serves as the executive producer, alongside developer Jim Dauterive.

Dan Fybel and Rich Rinaldi were promoted to executive producers during season 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team of writers includes Loren Bouchard, Jim Dauterive, Scott Jacobson, Lizzie Molyneux, Wendy Molyneux, Holly Schlesinger, Nora Smith, Steven Davis, Kelvin Yu, Dan Fybel, Rich Rinaldi, Jon Schroeder, and Greg Thompson. Past writers on the show include Kit Boss, Aron Abrams, and Mike Benner. H. Jon Benjamin, Rachel Hastings, Justin Hook, Dan Mintz, and Mike Olsen have also written or co-written episodes. After the writing has been completed, the voice actors read the script as written, but later are allowed to improvise lines. The editors and writer decide what improvised lines make the final cut.\\r\\n\\r\\nBob's Burgers has five main cast members: H. Jon Benjamin as Bob Belcher, John Roberts as Linda Belcher, Dan Mintz as Tina Belcher, Eugene Mirman as Gene Belcher, and Kristen Schaal as Louise Belcher.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe components of a hamburger fall into place on a white screen, and Bob's hands appear underneath to hold it. The other family members appear around him one at a time, beginning with Linda and ending with Louise. Linda puts her arm around Bob, Tina stands there expressionless, Gene plays a sound effect on his keyboard, and Louise poses for the camera. The restaurant then materializes behind them and the neighboring businesses slide into place, with a funeral parlor at screen left, and the street slides into view in front. A \\"Grand Opening\\" banner is placed over the door, followed by a series of mishaps. First, the restaurant catches on fire. Then, vermin come running toward the restaurant as an exterminator pulls up in a van. Lastly, a car crashes into the utility pole next to the funeral home, which causes the pole to fall through the front window of the restaurant. A new banner is hung up after each event: \\"Grand Re-Opening,\\" \\"Grand Re-Re-Opening,\\" and finally \\"Grand Re-Re-Re-Opening.\\" The camera then zooms in on the cheese on the burger Bob is holding, and the view fades in to the start of the episode.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with other Fox animated series such as Futurama, The Simpsons, and American Dad!, the show employs the \\"changing element\\" running gag in its opening credits. The gag present on Bob's Burgers involves the store located to the right of the restaurant, which has a new, humorously named client in every episode (such as \\"Betty's Machetes\\" in \\"Purple Rain-Union\\"). Additionally, beginning with Season 2, the pest control van in the sequence has the name of a different company on each episode; the van read \\"Rat's all Folks! Exterminators\\" on all episodes of Season 1. On certain episodes, an element is changed for a special night (a flash frame saying \\"HAPPY HALLOWEEN\\" was shown during the title sequence of \\"Fort Night\\"). \\r\\n\\r\\nIn an article written by the writers of the show ranking the best 10 musical numbers of the first three seasons, it is explained by show creator and theme composer Loren Bouchard that the ukulele track heard in the theme is an edited version of the first recording he did as well as the first take in 2008. Bouchard explains that if the EQ is taken off the original track, there is noise audible from the nightclub below the apartment he was living in when he recorded the theme.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe credits sequence of Bob's Burgers often features the Belcher family at work. The scene is the kitchen of Bob's Burgers drawn with a black outline over a white background and the characters in full color, with the credits off to the right hand side. The sequence consists of Bob cooking a burger and Louise and Tina doing prep. Bob places the burger on the plate for Louise to give to Linda, who takes it from the window, and a few seconds later Gene walks through the kitchen wearing his burger costume.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the kitchen scene is still the main closing sequence the show uses, beginning in season two the producers began to use different elements from the show in the credits. Some examples:\\r\\n\\r\\nOther times, the scene will play out as usual, but with something from the episode going on in the background, etc. For instance:\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery episode features one or more \\"Today's Special\\" burgers on a chalk board on the wall behind the counter. The name of the special is usually a play on words that indicates what comes on the burger (ex.: \\"It's Fun to Eat at the rYe M C A Burger\\": Comes with Rye, Mustard, Cheese, and Avocado). Other \\"Special\\" burgers are also mentioned by the family without being written on their chalkboard. The joke is often that the play on words is overly complex or obscure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first season through the current season of the show are available on the iTunes Store for download & Hulu. The first 8 seasons are available from Amazon Video. The first 7 seasons are available from Netflix Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nBob's Burgers initially received mixed reviews for season 1, with a Metacritic score of 54 out of 100.[31] However, by season 2, the ratings had reached a score of 78 out of 100, proving a rise in popularity with praises about its \\"daffy comedic momentum\\"  and how it is \\"new and fresh.\\"[32] Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season a 63% score based on 27 reviews with an average rating of 6.33/10. The site critical consensus states \\"A modestly immature workplace cartoon, not without potential, that needs to work on finding its rhythm\\".[33] The Washington Post described the show as \\"pointlessly vulgar and derivatively dull\\", while Reuters stated that \\"It's unwise ÿ and unnecessary ÿ to launch an animated sitcom on Fox that appears intent to ape the vulgarity quotient of Family Guy.\\"[1][34] USA Today stated that \\"Bob's Burgers isn't very tasty\\" describing the comedy as just \\"lop[ing] along, stumbling from one tasteless moment to the next\\"[35] The New York Times described the show as having \\"a lackadaisical vibe; its humor, no matter how anarchic, slides by in a deadpan monotone.\\"[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, as the first season progressed and concluded and the second began, critics began giving the series praise. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club has recalled, \\"...the show was amusing, yes, and there was certainly potential, but it took half a dozen episodes before it really began to meet that potential.\\"[37] Season 2 has a Metacritic score of 78 out 100.[38] The first season is considered by many fans as very rough in comparison to the quality in later seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nEntertainment Weekly gave the show an A- grade in its review, remarking that \\"a comedy this well done is very rare indeed\\".[39] Ain't It Cool News called Bob's Burgers \\"perhaps the funniest half-hour currently airing on broadcast TV.\\"[40] In its review, CNN called the show \\"wickedly funny\\" and said there are \\"too many highlights to list here\\".[41] Speaking about the show during its second season, The A.V. Club reviewer Rowan Kaiser said: \\"After an uneven start, Bob's Burgers is becoming one of television's best comedies!\\"[42] Since the debut of season two of the series, the show's positive reception has increased.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A.V. Club voted Bob's Burgers as the 10th best TV show of 2012,[44] the 3rd best show of 2013,[45] the 20th best show of 2014,[46] and the 35th best show of 2015.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter airing, the show became the highest-rated series premiere of the season and also finished 9th in the ratings for the week it aired.[80][81] Despite this, the ratings went on a slide with ratings expert Bill Gorman of TV by the Numbers calling it a \\"toss up\\" for renewal before the series was renewed for a second season[82] which premiered on March 11, 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdult Swim acquired the rights to air Bob's Burgers in 2013. Episodes air six nights a week, with a 1:30 am airing on Sunday and 8:30 pm airings Monday through Friday. An additional episode airs every Monday through Thursday at 9:00 pm. Adult Swim currently has rights to all five seasons of Bob's Burgers and recently began airing the season five episodes on Mondays.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\n20th Television began distributing Bob's Burgers to local stations in 2015.

Peter mutters \\"I'm very embarrassed\\", and the principal replies \\"Yeah, well, someone should be.\\" In \\"Boopa-dee Bappa-dee\\", Louise is one of many characters Stewie is turned into by Peter using a remote control. Bob's Burgers is also mentioned on \\"He's Bla-ack!\\", as one of the reasons why The Cleveland Show did not succeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe season 4 premiere episode of Archer features a crossover where the Belcher family is shown, but Bob is revealed to be Sterling Archer (also voiced by H. Jon Benjamin) in a fugue state. Archer has taken the place of Bob Belcher, with Bob inexplicably missing. The menu board touts the \\"Thomas Elphinstone Hambledurger, with Manning Coleslaw\\", a play on amnesiac secret agent Tommy Hambledon, a character in a series of novels by Manning Coles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Homerland\\", the season 25 premiere episode of The Simpsons, features a couch gag in which the Belcher family (skinned yellow according to the standard character coloring of the series) attend a 25th anniversary party in the Simpson family living room with the main characters of their fellow Animation Domination series. Bob made another cameo in the episode \\"The Girl Code\\", where a picture of him is shown, and explaining that the restaurant was boycotted by short people due to an offensive Burger of the Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBob makes a cameo appearance in the hour-long The Simpsons-Family Guy crossover \\"The Simpsons Guy\\".[111] He appears on the same airplane as Homer and Peter in a cutaway about them being a greater team than the Air Force. Peter remarks to Homer that they have to carry Bob, and then Peter points to Cleveland's plane and says \\"We let that other guy try and look what happened.\\" Cleveland, repeatedly saying \\"no\\", crashes in flames. This is a reference to the poor ratings of Bob's Burgers and the cancellation of The Cleveland Show.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Aqua Teen Hunger Force, a character previously known as Dr. Eugene Mirman (obviously played by himself) was renamed \\"Dr. Gene Belcher\\" in the episode \\"Hospice\\". The character's name was revealed on Aqua Teen Hunger Force's creator Dave Willis' Twitter account two hours before the episode. The character had been introduced in 2006, which was five years before Bob's Burgers aired.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeattle rock band Sleater-Kinney collaborated with Bob's Burgers and its crew for their 2015 single \\"A New Wave\\", from the album No Cities to Love. The resultant music video featured the band, animated in the cartoon's style, performing for the Belcher children in Tina's bedroom.[114][115][116]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, The Bob's Burgers Burger Book, edited by series creator Bouchard, was released.

Additionally, she is Head of the Commonwealth and Queen of 12 countries that have become independent since her accession: Jamaica, Barbados, the Bahamas, Grenada, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Kitts and Nevis.[b]\\r\\nElizabeth was born in London as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York, later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and she was educated privately at home. Her father acceded to the throne on the abdication of his brother Edward VIII in 1936, from which time she was the heir presumptive. She began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In 1947, she married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, with whom she has four children: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.\\r\\nElizabeth's many historic visits and meetings include a state visit to the Republic of Ireland and visits to or from five popes. She has seen major constitutional changes, such as devolution in the United Kingdom, Canadian patriation, and the decolonisation of Africa. She has reigned through various wars and conflicts involving many of her realms. She is the world's oldest reigning monarch as well as Britain's longest-lived. In 2015, she surpassed the reign of her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, to become the longest-reigning British monarch and the longest-reigning queen regnant and female head of state in world history. In October 2016, she became the longest currently reigning monarch and head of state following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand.\\r\\nTimes of personal significance have included the births and marriages of her children, her coronation in 1953, and the celebration of milestones such as her Silver, Golden, and Diamond Jubilees in 1977, 2002, and 2012, respectively. In 2017 she became the first British monarch to commemorate a Sapphire Jubilee. Moments of sorrow for her include the death of her father in 1952 at age 56; the assassination of Prince Philip's uncle Lord Mountbatten in 1979; the breakdown of her children's marriages in 1992 (her annus horribilis); the death in 1997 of her son's former wife, Diana, Princess of Wales; and the deaths of her mother and sister in 2002. Elizabeth has occasionally faced republican sentiments and press criticism of the royal family; however, support for the monarchy remains high, as does her personal popularity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was born at 02:40 (GMT) on 21 April 1926, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King George V. Her father, Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), was the second son of the King. Her mother, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth), was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. She was delivered by Caesarean section at her maternal grandfather's London house: 17 Bruton Street, Mayfair.[2] She was baptised by the Anglican Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 29 May,[3][c] and named Elizabeth after her mother, Alexandra after George V's mother, who had died six months earlier, and Mary after her paternal grandmother.[5] Called \\"Lilibet\\" by her close family,[6] based on what she called herself at first,[7] she was cherished by her grandfather George V, and during his serious illness in 1929 her regular visits were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery.[8]\\r\\nElizabeth's only sibling, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930. The two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and their governess, Marion Crawford, who was casually known as \\"Crawfie\\".[9] Lessons concentrated on history, language, literature and music.[10] Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled The Little Princesses in 1950, much to the dismay of the royal family.[11] The book describes Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness, and her attitude of responsibility.[12] Others echoed such observations: Winston Churchill described Elizabeth when she was two as \\"a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant.\\"[13] Her cousin Margaret Rhodes described her as \\"a jolly little girl, but fundamentally sensible and well-behaved\\".[14]\\r\\nDuring her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth was third in the line of succession to the throne, behind her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father, the Duke of York. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as the Prince of Wales was still young. Many people believed that he would marry and have children of his own.[15] When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second-in-line to the throne, after her father. Later that year, Edward abdicated, after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis.[16] Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, and she became heir presumptive. If her parents had had a later son, she would have lost her position as first-in-line, as her brother would have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession.[17]\\r\\nElizabeth received private tuition in constitutional history from Henry Marten, Vice-Provost of Eton College,[18] and learned French from a succession of native-speaking governesses.[19] A Girl Guides company, the 1st Buckingham Palace Company, was formed specifically so that she could socialise with girls her own age.[20] Later, she was enrolled as a Sea Ranger.[19]\\r\\nIn 1939, Elizabeth's parents toured Canada and the United States. As in 1927, when her parents had toured Australia and New Zealand, Elizabeth remained in Britain, since her father thought her too young to undertake public tours.[21] Elizabeth \\"looked tearful\\" as her parents departed.[22] They corresponded regularly,[22] and she and her parents made the first royal transatlantic telephone call on 18 May.[21]\\r\\nIn September 1939, Britain entered the Second World War, which lasted until 1945. During the war, many of London's children were evacuated to avoid the frequent aerial bombing. The suggestion by senior politician Lord Hailsham[23] that the two princesses should be evacuated to Canada was rejected by Elizabeth's mother, who declared, \\"The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave.\\"[24] Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret stayed at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House, Norfolk.[25] From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle, where they lived for most of the next five years.[26] At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments.[27] In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities.[28] She stated: \\"We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well.\\"[28]\\r\\nIn 1943, Elizabeth undertook her first solo public appearance on a visit to the Grenadier Guards, of which she had been appointed colonel the previous year.[29] As she approached her 18th birthday, parliament changed the law so that she could act as one of five Counsellors of State in the event of her father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944.[30] In February 1945, she joined the Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service as an honorary second subaltern with the service number of 230873.[31] She trained as a driver and mechanic and was promoted to honorary junior commander five months later.[32][33]\\r\\nAt the end of the war in Europe, on Victory in Europe Day, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret mingled anonymously with the celebratory crowds in the streets of London. Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, \\"We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised?... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.\\"[34]\\r\\nDuring the war, plans were drawn up to quell Welsh nationalism by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included a fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd, at a time when Britain was at war.[35] Welsh politicians suggested that she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent.[36] In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.[37]\\r\\nPrincess Elizabeth went in 1947 on her first overseas tour, accompanying her parents through southern Africa. During the tour, in a broadcast to the British Commonwealth on her 21st birthday, she made the following pledge: \\"I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.\\"[38]\\r\\nElizabeth met her future husband, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, in 1934 and 1937.[39] They are second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark and third cousins through Queen Victoria. After another meeting at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in July 1939, Elizabeth ÿ though only 13 years old ÿ said she fell in love with Philip and they began to exchange letters.[40] She was 21 when their engagement was officially announced on 9 July 1947.[41]\\r\\nThe engagement was not without controversy; Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born (though a British subject who had served in the Royal Navy throughout the Second World War), and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links.[42] Marion Crawford wrote, \\"Some of the King's advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip's foreign origin.\\"[43] Later biographies reported that Elizabeth's mother initially opposed the union, dubbing Philip \\"The Hun\\".[44] In later life, however, the Queen Mother told biographer Tim Heald that Philip was \\"an English gentleman\\".[45]\\r\\nBefore the marriage, Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles, officially converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Anglicanism, and adopted the style Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, taking the surname of his mother's British family.[46] Just before the wedding, he was created Duke of Edinburgh and granted the style His Royal Highness.[47]\\r\\nElizabeth and Philip were married on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey. They received 2500 wedding gifts from around the world.[48] Because Britain had not yet completely recovered from the devastation of the war, Elizabeth required ration coupons to buy the material for her gown, which was designed by Norman Hartnell.[49] In post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations, including his three surviving sisters, to be invited to the wedding.[50] The Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII, was not invited either.[51]\\r\\nElizabeth gave birth to her first child, Prince Charles, on 14 November 1948. One month earlier, the King had issued letters patent allowing her children to use the style and title of a royal prince or princess, to which they otherwise would not have been entitled as their father was no longer a royal prince.[52] A second child, Princess Anne, was born in 1950.[53]\\r\\nFollowing their wedding, the couple leased Windlesham Moor, near Windsor Castle, until July 1949,[48] when they took up residence at Clarence House in London. At various times between 1949 and 1951, the Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the British Crown Colony of Malta as a serving Royal Navy officer. He and Elizabeth lived intermittently in Malta for several months at a time in the hamlet of Gwardaman?a, at Villa Guardamangia, the rented home of Philip's uncle, Lord Mountbatten. The children remained in Britain.[54]\\r\\nDuring 1951, George VI's health declined and Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events. When she toured Canada and visited President Harry S. Truman in Washington, D.C., in October 1951, her private secretary, Martin Charteris, carried a draft accession declaration in case the King died while she was on tour.[55] In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of Kenya. On 6 February 1952, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, Sagana Lodge, after a night spent at Treetops Hotel, when word arrived of the death of the King and consequently Elizabeth's immediate accession to the throne. Philip broke the news to the new Queen.[56] Martin Charteris asked her to choose a regnal name; she chose to remain Elizabeth, \\"of course\\".[57] She was proclaimed queen throughout her realms and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom.[58] She and the Duke of Edinburgh moved into Buckingham Palace.[59]\\r\\nWith Elizabeth's accession, it seemed probable that the royal house would bear her husband's name, becoming the House of Mountbatten, in line with the custom of a wife taking her husband's surname on marriage. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and Elizabeth's grandmother, Queen Mary, favoured the retention of the House of Windsor, and so on 9 April 1952 Elizabeth issued a declaration that Windsor would continue to be the name of the royal house. The Duke complained, \\"I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.\\"[60] In 1960, after the death of Queen Mary in 1953 and the resignation of Churchill in 1955, the surname Mountbatten-Windsor was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles.[61]\\r\\nAmid preparations for the coronation, Princess Margaret informed her sister that she wished to marry Peter Townsend, a divorc? 16 years Margaret's senior, with two sons from his previous marriage. The Queen asked them to wait for a year; in the words of Martin Charteris, \\"the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess, but I think she thought ÿ she hoped ÿ given time, the affair would peter out.\\"[62] Senior politicians were against the match and the Church of England did not permit remarriage after divorce. If Margaret had contracted a civil marriage, she would have been expected to renounce her right of succession.[63] Eventually, she decided to abandon her plans with Townsend.[64] In 1960, she married Antony Armstrong-Jones, who was created Earl of Snowdon the following year. They divorced in 1978; she did not remarry.[65]\\r\\nDespite the death of Queen Mary on 24 March, the coronation on 2 June 1953 went ahead as planned, as Mary had asked before she died.[66] The ceremony in Westminster Abbey, with the exception of the anointing and communion, was televised for the first time.[67][d] Elizabeth's coronation gown was embroidered on her instructions with the floral emblems of Commonwealth countries:[71] English Tudor rose; Scots thistle; Welsh leek; Irish shamrock; Australian wattle; Canadian maple leaf; New Zealand silver fern; South African protea; lotus flowers for India and Ceylon; and Pakistan's wheat, cotton, and jute.[72]\\r\\nFrom Elizabeth's birth onwards, the British Empire continued its transformation into the Commonwealth of Nations.[73] By the time of her accession in 1952, her role as head of multiple independent states was already established.[74] In 1953, the Queen and her husband embarked on a seven-month round-the-world tour, visiting 13 countries and covering more than 40,000 miles by land, sea and air.[75] She became the first reigning monarch of Australia and New Zealand to visit those nations.[76] During the tour, crowds were immense; three-quarters of the population of Australia were estimated to have seen her.[77] Throughout her reign, the Queen has made hundreds of state visits to other countries and tours of the Commonwealth; she is the most widely travelled head of state.[78]\\r\\nIn 1956, the British and French prime ministers, Sir Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet, discussed the possibility of France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted and the following year France signed the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, the precursor to the European Union.[79] In November 1956, Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal. Lord Mountbatten claimed the Queen was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.[80]\\r\\nThe absence of a formal mechanism within the Conservative Party for choosing a leader meant that, following Eden's resignation, it fell to the Queen to decide whom to commission to form a government. Eden recommended that she consult Lord Salisbury, the Lord President of the Council. Lord Salisbury and Lord Kilmuir, the Lord Chancellor, consulted the British Cabinet, Winston Churchill, and the Chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, resulting in the Queen appointing their recommended candidate: Harold Macmillan.[81]\\r\\nThe Suez crisis and the choice of Eden's successor led in 1957 to the first major personal criticism of the Queen. In a magazine, which he owned and edited,[82] Lord Altrincham accused her of being \\"out of touch\\".[83] Altrincham was denounced by public figures and slapped by a member of the public appalled by his comments.[84] Six years later, in 1963, Macmillan resigned and advised the Queen to appoint the Earl of Home as prime minister, advice that she followed.[85] The Queen again came under criticism for appointing the prime minister on the advice of a small number of ministers or a single minister.[85] In 1965, the Conservatives adopted a formal mechanism for electing a leader, thus relieving her of involvement.[86]\\r\\nIn 1957, she made a state visit to the United States, where she addressed the United Nations General Assembly on behalf of the Commonwealth. On the same tour, she opened the 23rd Canadian Parliament, becoming the first monarch of Canada to open a parliamentary session.[87] Two years later, solely in her capacity as Queen of Canada, she revisited the United States and toured Canada.[87][88] In 1961, she toured Cyprus, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Iran.[89] On a visit to Ghana the same year, she dismissed fears for her safety, even though her host, President Kwame Nkrumah, who had replaced her as head of state, was a target for assassins.[90] Harold Macmillan wrote, \\"The Queen has been absolutely determined all through?... She is impatient of the attitude towards her to treat her as?... a film star?... She has indeed 'the heart and stomach of a man'?... She loves her duty and means to be a Queen.\\"[90] Before her tour through parts of Quebec in 1964, the press reported that extremists within the Quebec separatist movement were plotting Elizabeth's assassination.[91][92] No attempt was made, but a riot did break out while she was in Montreal; the Queen's \\"calmness and courage in the face of the violence\\" was noted.[93]\\r\\nElizabeth's pregnancies with Princes Andrew and Edward, in 1959 and 1963, mark the only times she has not performed the State Opening of the British parliament during her reign.[94] In addition to performing traditional ceremonies, she also instituted new practices. Her first royal walkabout, meeting ordinary members of the public, took place during a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1970.[95]\\r\\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw an acceleration in the decolonisation of Africa and the Caribbean. Over 20 countries gained independence from Britain as part of a planned transition to self-government. In 1965, however, the Rhodesian Prime Minister, Ian Smith, in opposition to moves towards majority rule, declared unilateral independence from Britain while still expressing \\"loyalty and devotion\\" to Elizabeth. Although the Queen dismissed him in a formal declaration, and the international community applied sanctions against Rhodesia, his regime survived for over a decade.[96] As Britain's ties to its former empire weakened, the British government sought entry to the European Community, a goal it achieved in 1973.[97]\\r\\nIn February 1974, the British Prime Minister, Edward Heath, advised the Queen to call a general election in the middle of her tour of the Austronesian Pacific Rim, requiring her to fly back to Britain.[98] The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party, but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the Liberals. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government.[99]\\r\\nA year later, at the height of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals.[100] As Whitlam had a majority in the House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, stating that she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general.[101] The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.[100]\\r\\nIn 1977, Elizabeth marked the Silver Jubilee of her accession. Parties and events took place throughout the Commonwealth, many coinciding with her associated national and Commonwealth tours. The celebrations re-affirmed the Queen's popularity, despite virtually coincident negative press coverage of Princess Margaret's separation from her husband.[102] In 1978, the Queen endured a state visit to the United Kingdom by Romania's communist leader, Nicolae Ceau?escu, and his wife, Elena,[103] though privately she thought they had \\"blood on their hands\\".[104] The following year brought two blows: one was the unmasking of Anthony Blunt, former Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, as a communist spy; the other was the assassination of her relative and in-law Lord Mountbatten by the Provisional Irish Republican Army.[105]\\r\\nAccording to Paul Martin, Sr., by the end of the 1970s the Queen was worried that the Crown \\"had little meaning for\\" Pierre Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister.[106] Tony Benn said that the Queen found Trudeau \\"rather disappointing\\".[106] Trudeau's supposed republicanism seemed to be confirmed by his antics, such as sliding down banisters at Buckingham Palace and pirouetting behind the Queen's back in 1977, and the removal of various Canadian royal symbols during his term of office.[106] In 1980, Canadian politicians sent to London to discuss the patriation of the Canadian constitution found the Queen \\"better informed?... than any of the British politicians or bureaucrats\\".[106] She was particularly interested after the failure of Bill C-60, which would have affected her role as head of state.[106] Patriation removed the role of the British parliament from the Canadian constitution, but the monarchy was retained. Trudeau said in his memoirs that the Queen favoured his attempt to reform the constitution and that he was impressed by \\"the grace she displayed in public\\" and \\"the wisdom she showed in private\\".[107]\\r\\nDuring the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony, six weeks before the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer, six shots were fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down The Mall on her horse, Burmese. Police later discovered that the shots were blanks. The 17-year-old assailant, Marcus Sarjeant, was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three.[108] The Queen's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised.[109]\\r\\nFrom April to September 1982, the Queen was anxious[110] but proud[111] of her son, Prince Andrew, who was serving with British forces during the Falklands War. On 9 July, the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder, Michael Fagan, in the room with her. In a serious lapse of security, assistance only arrived after two calls to the Palace police switchboard.[112] After hosting US President Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visiting his California ranch in 1983, the Queen was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada, one of her Caribbean realms, without informing her.[113]\\r\\nIntense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true.[114] As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \\"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not trueso long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\\"[115] Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \\"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of?... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation.[116] Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party ÿ Thatcher's political opponents.[117] Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed \\"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\\".[118] Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen,[119] and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift ÿ membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter ÿ to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major.[120] Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a \\"behind the scenes force\\" in ending apartheid.[121][122]\\r\\nIn 1987, in Canada, Elizabeth publicly supported politically divisive constitutional amendments, prompting criticism from opponents of the proposed changes, including Pierre Trudeau.[121] The same year, the elected Fijian government was deposed in a military coup. As monarch of Fiji, Elizabeth supported the attempts of the Governor-General, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic.[123] By the start of 1991, republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of the Queen's private wealth ÿ which were contradicted by the Palace ÿ and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family.[124] The involvement of younger members of the royal family in the charity game show It's a Royal Knockout was ridiculed,[125] and the Queen was the target of satire.[126]\\r\\nIn 1991, in the wake of coalition victory in the Gulf War, the Queen became the first British monarch to address a joint meeting of the United States Congress.[127]\\r\\nIn a speech on 24 November 1992, to mark the 40th anniversary of her accession, Elizabeth called 1992 her annus horribilis, meaning horrible year.[128] In March, her second son, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and his wife, Sarah, separated; in April, her daughter, Princess Anne, divorced Captain Mark Phillips;[129] during a state visit to Germany in October, angry demonstrators in Dresden threw eggs at her;[130] and, in November, a large fire broke out at Windsor Castle, one of her official residences. The monarchy came under increased criticism and public scrutiny.[131] In an unusually personal speech, the Queen said that any institution must expect criticism, but suggested it be done with \\"a touch of humour, gentleness and understanding\\".[132] Two days later, the Prime Minister, John Major, announced reforms to the royal finances planned since the previous year, including the Queen paying income tax from 1993 onwards, and a reduction in the civil list.[133] In December, Prince Charles and his wife, Diana, formally separated.[134] The year ended with a lawsuit as the Queen sued The Sun newspaper for breach of copyright when it published the text of her annual Christmas message two days before it was broadcast. The newspaper was forced to pay her legal fees and donated S200,000 to charity.[135]\\r\\nIn the years to follow, public revelations on the state of Charles and Diana's marriage continued.[136] Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher than at any time in living memory, republicanism was still a minority viewpoint, and the Queen herself had high approval ratings.[137] Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the Queen's wider family rather than her own behaviour and actions.[138] In consultation with her husband and the Prime Minister, John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and her private secretary, Robert Fellowes, she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, saying that a divorce was desirable.[139]\\r\\nIn August 1997, a year after the divorce, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. The Queen was on holiday with her extended family at Balmoral. Diana's two sons by Charles ÿ Princes William and Harry ÿ wanted to attend church and so the Queen and Prince Philip took them that morning.[140] After that single public appearance, for five days the Queen and the Duke shielded their grandsons from the intense press interest by keeping them at Balmoral where they could grieve in private,[141] but the royal family's seclusion and the failure to fly a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace caused public dismay.[122][142] Pressured by the hostile reaction, the Queen agreed to return to London and do a live television broadcast on 5 September, the day before Diana's funeral.[143] In the broadcast, she expressed admiration for Diana and her feelings \\"as a grandmother\\" for the two princes.[144] As a result, much of the public hostility evaporated.[144]\\r\\nIn November 1997, the Queen and her husband held a reception at Banqueting House to mark their golden wedding anniversary.[145] She made a speech and praised Philip for his role as a consort, referring to him as \\"my strength and stay\\".[145]\\r\\nIn 2002, Elizabeth marked her Golden Jubilee. Her sister and mother died in February and March respectively, and the media speculated whether the Jubilee would be a success or a failure.[146] She again undertook an extensive tour of her realms, which began in Jamaica in February, where she called the farewell banquet \\"memorable\\" after a power cut plunged the King's House, the official residence of the governor-general, into darkness.[147] As in 1977, there were street parties and commemorative events, and monuments were named to honour the occasion. A million people attended each day of the three-day main Jubilee celebration in London,[148] and the enthusiasm shown by the public for the Queen was greater than many journalists had expected.[149]\\r\\nThough generally healthy throughout her life, in 2003 she had keyhole surgery on both knees. In October 2006, she missed the opening of the new Emirates Stadium because of a strained back muscle that had been troubling her since the summer.[150]\\r\\nIn May 2007, The Daily Telegraph, citing unnamed sources, reported that the Queen was \\"exasperated and frustrated\\" by the policies of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, that she was concerned the British Armed Forces were overstretched in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that she had raised concerns over rural and countryside issues with Blair.[151] She was, however, said to admire Blair's efforts to achieve peace in Northern Ireland.[152] She became the first British monarch to celebrate a diamond wedding anniversary in November 2007.[153] On 20 March 2008, at the Church of Ireland St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh, the Queen attended the first Maundy service held outside England and Wales.[154] At the invitation of the Irish President, Mary McAleese, the Queen made the first state visit to the Republic of Ireland by a British monarch in May 2011.[155]\\r\\nThe Queen addressed the United Nations for a second time in 2010, again in her capacity as Queen of all Commonwealth realms and Head of the Commonwealth.[156] The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, introduced her as \\"an anchor for our age\\".[157] During her visit to New York, which followed a tour of Canada, she officially opened a memorial garden for the British victims of the September 11 attacks.[157] The Queen's visit to Australia in October 2011 ÿ her sixteenth visit since 1954 ÿ was called her \\"farewell tour\\" in the press because of her age.[158]\\r\\nHer Diamond Jubilee in 2012 marked 60 years on the throne, and celebrations were held throughout her realms, the wider Commonwealth, and beyond. In a message released on Accession Day, Elizabeth wrote:\\r\\nShe and her husband undertook an extensive tour of the United Kingdom, while her children and grandchildren embarked on royal tours of other Commonwealth states on her behalf.[160][161] On 4 June, Jubilee beacons were lit around the world.[162] In November, the Queen and her husband celebrated their sapphire wedding anniversary.[163] On 18 December, she became the first British sovereign to attend a peacetime Cabinet meeting since George III in 1781.[164]\\r\\nThe Queen, who opened the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, also opened the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in London, making her the first head of state to open two Olympic Games in two different countries.[165] For the London Olympics, she played herself in a short film as part of the opening ceremony, alongside Daniel Craig as James Bond.[166] On 4 April 2013, she received an honorary BAFTA for her patronage of the film industry and was called \\"the most memorable Bond girl yet\\" at the award ceremony.[167]\\r\\nOn 3 March 2013, Elizabeth was admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital as a precaution after developing symptoms of gastroenteritis. She returned to Buckingham Palace the following day.[168] A week later, she signed the new Commonwealth charter.[169] Because of her age and the need for her to limit travelling, in 2013 she chose not to attend the biennial meeting of Commonwealth heads of government for the first time in 40 years. She was represented at the summit in Sri Lanka by her son, Prince Charles.[170]\\r\\nThe Queen surpassed her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, to become the longest-lived British monarch in December 2007, and the longest-reigning British monarch on 9 September 2015.[171] She was celebrated in Canada as the \\"longest-reigning sovereign in Canada's modern era\\".[172] (King Louis XIV of France reigned over Canada (New France) for longer.)[173] She is also the longest-reigning queen regnant in history,[174] and the world's oldest reigning monarch. She became the longest-serving current head of state following the death of King Bhumibol of Thailand on 13 October 2016.[175][176] On 6 February 2017, she became the first British monarch to commemorate a Sapphire Jubilee.[177]\\r\\nPrince Philip retired from his official duties as the Queen's consort in August 2017.[178] The Queen herself does not intend to abdicate,[179] though Prince Charles is expected to take on more of her workload as Elizabeth, who celebrated her 91st birthday in 2017, carries out fewer public engagements.[180] Plans for her death and funeral have been extensively prepared by most British government and media organisations for decades.[181]\\r\\nSince Elizabeth rarely gives interviews, little is known of her personal feelings. As a constitutional monarch, she has not expressed her own political opinions in a public forum. She does have a deep sense of religious and civic duty, and takes her coronation oath seriously.[182] Aside from her official religious role as Supreme Governor of the established Church of England, she is personally a member of that church and the national Church of Scotland.[183] She has demonstrated support for inter-faith relations and has met with leaders of other churches and religions, including five popes: Pius XII, John XXIII, John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis.[184] A personal note about her faith often features in her annual Christmas message broadcast to the Commonwealth. In 2000, she spoke about the theological significance of the millennium marking the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus:\\r\\nTo many of us, our beliefs are of fundamental importance. For me the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life. I, like so many of you, have drawn great comfort in difficult times from Christ's words and example.[185]\\r\\nShe is patron of over 600 organisations and charities.[186] Her main leisure interests include equestrianism and dogs, especially her Pembroke Welsh Corgis.[187] Her lifelong love of corgis began in 1933 with Dookie, the first corgi owned by her family.[188][189] Scenes of a relaxed, informal home life have occasionally been witnessed; she and her family, from time to time, prepare a meal together and do the washing up afterwards.[190]\\r\\nIn the 1950s, as a young woman at the start of her reign, Elizabeth was depicted as a glamorous \\"fairytale Queen\\".[191] After the trauma of the Second World War, it was a time of hope, a period of progress and achievement heralding a \\"new Elizabethan age\\".[192] Lord Altrincham's accusation in 1957 that her speeches sounded like those of a \\"priggish schoolgirl\\" was an extremely rare criticism.[193] In the late 1960s, attempts to portray a more modern image of the monarchy were made in the television documentary Royal Family and by televising Prince Charles's investiture as Prince of Wales.[194] In public, she took to wearing mostly solid-colour overcoats and decorative hats, which allow her to be seen easily in a crowd.[195]\\r\\nAt her Silver Jubilee in 1977, the crowds and celebrations were genuinely enthusiastic,[196] but in the 1980s, public criticism of the royal family increased, as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth's children came under media scrutiny.[197] Elizabeth's popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public.[198] Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, though Elizabeth's personal popularity and support for the monarchy rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.[199]\\r\\nIn November 1999, a referendum in Australia on the future of the Australian monarchy favoured its retention in preference to an indirectly elected head of state.[200] Polls in Britain in 2006 and 2007 revealed strong support for Elizabeth,[201] and in 2012, her Diamond Jubilee year, approval ratings hit 90 percent.[202] Referenda in Tuvalu in 2008 and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 2009 both rejected proposals to become republics.[203]\\r\\nElizabeth has been portrayed in a variety of media by many notable artists, including painters Pietro Annigoni, Peter Blake, Chinwe Chukwuogo-Roy, Terence Cuneo, Lucian Freud, Damien Hirst, Juliet Pannett, and Tai-Shan Schierenberg.[204][205] Notable photographers of Elizabeth have included Cecil Beaton, Yousuf Karsh, Annie Leibovitz, Lord Lichfield, Terry O'Neill, John Swannell, and Dorothy Wilding. The first official portrait of Elizabeth was taken by Marcus Adams in 1926.[206]\\r\\nElizabeth's personal fortune has been the subject of speculation for many years. In 1971 Jock Colville, who was her former private secretary and a director of her bank, Coutts, estimated her wealth at S2?million (equivalent to about S25?million today[207]).[208][209] In 1993, Buckingham Palace called estimates of S100?million \\"grossly overstated\\".[210] In 2002, she inherited an estate worth an estimated S70?million from her mother.[211] The Sunday Times Rich List 2017 estimated her personal wealth at S360?million, making her the 329th richest person in the UK.[212]\\r\\nThe Royal Collection, which includes thousands of historic works of art and the Crown Jewels, is not owned by the Queen personally but is held in trust,[213] as are her official residences, such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle,[214] and the Duchy of Lancaster, a property portfolio valued at S472?million in 2015.[215] Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle are personally owned by the Queen.[214] The British Crown Estate ÿ with holdings of S12?billion in 2016[212] ÿ is held in trust and cannot be sold or owned by Elizabeth in a personal capacity.[216]\\r\\nElizabeth has held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, is Sovereign of many orders in her own countries, and has received honours and awards from around the world. In each of her realms she has a distinct title that follows a similar formula: Queen of Jamaica and her other realms and territories in Jamaica, Queen of Australia and her other realms and territories in Australia, etc. In the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, which are Crown dependencies rather than separate realms, she is known as Duke of Normandy and Lord of Mann, respectively. Additional styles include Defender of the Faith and Duke of Lancaster. When in conversation with the Queen, the practice is to initially address her as Your Majesty and thereafter as Ma'am.[217]\\r\\nFrom 21 April 1944 until her accession, Elizabeth's arms consisted of a lozenge bearing the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom differenced with a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing a Tudor rose and the first and third a cross of St George.[218] Upon her accession, she inherited the various arms her father held as sovereign. The Queen also possesses royal standards and personal flags for use in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, Barbados, and elsewhere.[219]","input":"When did the queen have her first child?"},{"output":"4,627","context":"","input":"How many universities and colleges in the us?"},{"output":"drought","context":"A drought in the Western Cape province of South Africa began in 2015 and is resulting in a severe water shortage in the region, most notably affecting the city of Cape Town. With dam levels predicted to decline to critically low levels, the city announced plans for \\"Day Zero\\", when the municipal water supply will largely be shut off, potentially making Cape Town the first major city to run out of water.[1][2][3] Through water saving measures and water supply augmentation, by March 2018 the City had reduced its daily water consumption by more than half to around 500 million litres per day, resulting in the initial prediction of Day Zero in April 2018 being pushed back to 2019. The situation however remains severe, particularly if the run of record dry winters continues through 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cape Town region experiences a Mediterranean climate with warm, dry summers and winter rainfall. Water is supplied largely from the six major dams of the Western Cape Water Supply System in mountainous areas close to the city.[4] The dams are recharged by rain falling in their catchment areas, largely during the cooler winter months of May to August, and dam levels decline during the dry summer months of December to February during which urban and agricultural water use increases.\\r\\nCape Town's population has grown from 2.4 million residents in 1995 to an estimated 4.3 million by 2018, representing a 79 percent population increase in 23 years whereas dam water storage only increased by 15 percent in the same period.[5] In 2016/2017, 64.5% of the city's water supply went to formal residential users, while 3.6 percent went to informal settlements.[6]\\r\\nThe possibility of the city exceeding its water supply was highlighted as early as 1990.[7]\\r\\nFrom 1950 to 1999, the city's consumption of treated water grew at 4% per year in line with the city's population growth. Water consumption peaked in 1999 at 335 million cubic metres (335 gigalitres) per year. Periods of low winter rainfall in 2000/2001 and 2003/2004 resulted in water restrictions being imposed.[8][9] In 2007, the city implemented a 10-year water demand management strategy, which has successfully kept the annual consumption at or below the 1999 level despite ongoing population growth.[8]\\r\\nIn 2009, the storage capacity of the dams supplying Cape Town was increased by 17 percent from 768 to 898 million cubic metres through the completion of the Berg River Dam.[10] Despite the increased storage capacity, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry predicted that the growing demand from the city would exceed supply by 2013 without water conservation and demand management measures by the city, and that even with those measures, further water sources would be required by 2019.[11]\\r\\nThere was is a plan of action developed in 2000 called Africa Water Vision 2025 that was aimed at equitable and sustainable use of water for socioeconomic development. This article evaluated South Africas progress on the objectives laid out in the plan. [12]\\r\\nThe cause of water loss in Cape Town has been debated. ?While drought is a factor in the citys water scarcity, the degree of drought has been questioned. ?It is believed water scarcity, caused by the drought, is being exacerbated by population growth, potentially unreported agriculture use, invasive species, and poor planning of water management. Cape town particularly has grown by 50 percent in the last decade.[13]\\r\\nWhile rainfall tends to undulate at stations monitoring rainfall where water is stored for Cape Town, there has been a clear, significant drop in 2016. ?\\r\\nA study conducted by the Climate System Analysis Group at the University of Cape Town ran statistical analyses to determine that rainfall between the years 2015 and 2017 was very rare and severe.[14]\\r\\nSome scientists believe this once in a millennium drought is being exacerbated by climate change with a one degree celsius increase in temperature over the past century. ?Models predict Cape Town will increase another 0.25 degrees celsius in the next ten years, which would increase drought likelihood by by to seven times. Previous climate modeling suggested a likely decrease in rainfall due to climate change, and this is likely some of the first evidence supporting the model. ?There is additional concern that several other cities will follow suit behind Cape Town in water scarcity.[15]\\r\\nA major problem with Cape Towns water dependence is that their water systems were built on the stable climate of previous years. ?Climate change has changed precipitation patterns in the area, leading to less stable sources of water and a quicker rate of water loss than previously expected. Another large cause of water scarcity is agriculture use, which consumes 80 to 90 percent of the areas water. ?In 2016, Cape Town exported 113 million gallons of wine to Europe and the US. For each gallon of wine, between 666 and 1,357 gallons of water is used. One third of the water exported through the wine industry could be used for the 7 million people without access to water in South Africa. ? In addition, Cape Town exported roughly 231,000 tons of citrus fruits in 2017, resulting in an additional exportation of roughly 30 billion gallons of the areas water. Exporting the 211 tons of platinum in 2012 cost the area 45 billion gallons of water. [16]\\r\\nAfter good rains in 2013 and 2014, the city of Cape Town began experiencing a drought in 2015, the first of three consecutive years of dry winters brought on by the El Ni?o weather pattern and climate change.[18] Water levels in the city's dams declined from 71.9 percent in 2014 to 50.1 percent in 2015.[5] Water restrictions, in place at \\"Level 1\\" since 2005, were increased to Level 2 on 1 January 2016 and to Level 3 on 1 November 2016.\\r\\nSignificant droughts in other parts of South Africa ended in August 2016 through heavy rain and flooding in the interior of the country,[19] but the drought in the Western Cape remained.\\r\\nWater restrictions were increased to Level 3B Level 3B on 1 February 2017.\\r\\nBy the end of the dry season in May 2017, the drought was declared the city's worst in a century, with dams having less than 10 percent of their usable capacity.[20] Level 4 water restrictions were imposed, limiting the consumption of water to 100 litres per person per day.[21]\\r\\nIn June 2017 a significant storm hit the area, dropping up to 50 mm of rain, but not enough to break the drought.[22] Overall rainfall in 2017 was the lowest since 1933.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the dry summer season approaching, the city increased its existing water restrictions to Level 4B on 1 July 2017, and to Level 5 on 3 September 2017, banning most outdoor and non-essential use of water, encouraging the use of greywater for toilet flushing, and aiming to limit the per capita water consumption to 87 litres per day, for a total of 500 million litres per day.[24]\\r\\nBy early October 2017, following a low rainfall winter, Cape Town had an estimated five months before water levels would be depleted.[25] In the same month, the City of Cape Town issued an emergency water plan to be rolled-out in multiple phases depending on the severity of the water shortage. Phase 1 was \\"water rationing through extreme pressure reduction\\" which involved temporary water cuts and rationing. Phase 1 was implemented immediately with unannounced water cuts to a number of outlying neighbourhoods. In Phase 2 water will be shut off to most of the system except to places of key water access. Phase 3 is the point at which the city can no longer draw water from surface dams in the Western Cape Water Supply System and there is a limited period of time before the water supply system fails.[26]\\r\\nIn mid-October 2017 the City was criticised by water desalination companies for the slow pace of contract negotiations, high level of bureaucracy, lack of urgency, and the inadequate scale of the proposed water supply projects.[27] On 26 October 2017 it was announced that the Cape Town city manager would be given special powers to take drought-related actions that would not have to follow the city's normal decision making and approval process. This announcement came after a review of the city's decision making processes that found \\"certain aspects of the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act, the Municipal Finance Management Act and Supply Chain Management regulations, as well as the council's own Supply Chain Management Policy, failed to adequately provide for the City of Cape Town to 'deal effectively and timeously' with the disaster.\\"[28]\\r\\nLevel 6 restrictions were imposed on 1 January 2018, and Level 6B on 1 February 2018, limiting consumption to 50 litres per person per day.\\r\\nOn 24 January 2018, the Western Cape provincial cabinet stated that it was the responsibility of the national government to fund the expansion of the water system as the \\"provision of bulk water supply is a national government mandate.\\" The provincial cabinet also announced that it was drawing up plans with the South African Police Service for a strategy to deploy officers at water distribution points across the city after day zero.[29]\\r\\nIn mid-January 2018, Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille announced that the city would be forced to shut off most of the municipal water supply if conditions do not change. \\"Day Zero\\" would be declared when the water level of the city's major dams reached 13.5%, and Level 7 would be declared, with municipal water supplies largely switched off, and residents relying on 149 water collection points around the city to collect a daily ration of 25 litres of water per person.[30][31] This would further affect Cape Town's economy, because of employees having \\"to take time off from work to wait in line for water\\".[32] Water supply would be maintained in the city's CBD, in informal settlements (where water is already collected from central locations) and essential services such as hospitals. At the time of the announcement, Day Zero was projected to take place on 22 April 2018, shortly afterwards revised forward to 12 April.[33][34][35] The Day Zero date is projected based on the fortnightly change in dam storage levels, assuming that this rate will continue unchanged, with no further rainfall or change in water demand.[36]\\r\\nIn February 2018, the Groenland Water Users' Association (a representative body for farmers in the Elgin and Grabouw agricultural areas around Cape Town) began releasing an additional 10 billion litres of water into the Steenbras Dam.[37]\\r\\nResidential water usage declined significantly under the 6B restrictions to a low of 511 million litres on March 12, the closest yet to the recommended level of 450 million litres per day. Agricultural use also declined significantly. As these reductions took effect and as water transferred from the Groenland Water Users' Association reached the city's water supply, Day Zero was moved back in stages from April to August,[38][39][40][41][36][3] and then postponed indefinitely.[42]\\r\\nResearch on long-term weather data done by the University of Cape Town found that the period from 2015-2017 has been the driest 3-year period since 1933, and 2017 was the driest year since 1933, and possibly earlier, since comparable data before 1933 was not available. It also found that a drought of this severity will statistically occur only once every 311 years.[23] Modelling by Aurecon found that the drought was approximately a 1 in 400 year event.[43]\\r\\nOnce lush city parks and golf courses have withered, and public restrooms now urge visitors to flush only when absolutely necessary.[32] Cafes began using plastic and paper cups and plates to reduce dishwashing loads. Analysts estimate that the water crisis will cost some 300,000 jobs in agriculture and tens of thousands more in the service, hospitality and food sectors. [32]\\r\\nIn response to the water shortage, the agricultural sector reduced water consumption by 50 percent, contributing to the loss of 37,000 jobs in the sector nationally, and leading to an estimated 50,000 being pushed below the poverty line due to job losses and inflation due to increases in the price of food.[25] By February 2018 the agricultural sector had incurred R14 billion (US$1.17 billion) in losses due to the water shortage.[44]\\r\\nIn office buildings and many public places throughout Cape Town, water was removed from toilets to prevent flushing and aid in water conservation. Rainwater was directed to be added to the tank if the toilet needed flushing. However, residents have been directed not to flush the toilet if only urinating but use a disinfectant/scented spray afterwards. If defecating residents have been directed to use rainwater or greywater to flush. Hand sanitizer has also been provided in offices and public buildings to use instead of conventional handwashing to conserve water.\\r\\nThe city is urging residents to stock up on emergency drinking water. But the task is proving to be more difficult than residents thought. Stores are selling out of water the minute it is delivered and shopkeepers are uncertain when more will arrive. Residents can go to a natural spring to collect water but this means waiting in line for hours on end to fill their allotment. [32]\\r\\nResidents of Cape Town have been restricted to only 13 gallons or 50 liters of water per person per day. ?In addition, toilets are only using non-potable water, and citizens are only allowed to shower once a week. This has led public health professionals to raise concerns of diseases such as fecal-oral contamination of the water, the food, and the hands, as a result of less hand-washing.\\r\\nClean water is essential to prevention of disease. A lack of water also comes with a lack of sanitation. Personal hygiene is essential to decrease disease spread. Inadequate sanitation is one of the leading causes of diarrheal diseases. ?Approximately 2.2 million people die every year from diarrheal diseases already, with most deaths occurring among children younger than 5 years of age. With a population around 3.81 million and a population density of around 1530 per square kilometer, diseases like cholera and others will spread rapidly without proper sanitation. This is only exasperated in impoverished neighborhoods in Cape Town. ?Without clean water the public health consequences continue as insects are attracted and reproduce in dirty waters, further spreading disease. The problem continues to snowball as standing water will bacteria and parasites start to grow.[45]\\r\\nWhat disease can be caused by drought:\\r\\nThe Western Cape of South Africa has seen a  the second-highest incidence of listeriosis in South Africa.[46] As a whole, South Africa has been victim to the the largest outbreak of the disease on record. According to the Western Cape Health Department, 29 people have died of the disease since last year of 115 cases reported. Listeriosis can particularly threatens newborns as it can spread through lack of or inadequate hand-washing and failure to rinse vegetables, fruits, and other raw foods thoroughly. Officials warn that water-borne illnesses such as cholera, hepatitis A and typhoid fever likely will become more prevalent as residents begin storing water in contaminated containers.\\r\\nPublic health companies, research centers and health providers also worry about the impact the water crisis will have on health services. Some are thinking ahead to the impact of employees being unable to come into work because they are waiting in lines for water which are becoming longer and longer.[46]\\r\\nEmergency shower and eyewash stations are an essential part of workplace safety for many laboratories and factories. ?A steady supply of water is necessary in the event of harmful chemical exposure. Many Occupational Health and Safety requirements suggest that all emergency showers be able to pump 75 litres per minute for a minimum of 15 minutes.[47] This would use approximately three weeks of water. If these wash stations are banned or limited, workers who handle highly corrosive chemicals would be vulnerable. ?\\r\\nFire risk increases as environment and infrastructure become increasingly dry. This is epically significant for large industrial sites and warehousing as fire on one site can spread more easily to other buildings in close proximity. Fire suppression system may also fail due to reduced water pressure in high-use areas.[48]\\r\\nIn homes and orphanages, children are one of the most vulnerable populations in Cape Town to suffer from health effects of water scarcity. The feeding, washing, and sterilization required to care for children is water intensive.[49] Furthermore, If schools in the Western Cape have their taps turned off on Day Zero, 1.1 million children could be left stranded without water.[50]\\r\\nThe agriculture industry is one of the largest consumers of water. The wine industry in and surrounding Cape Town is a major tourist draw and is a significant aspect of the economy, employing 300,000 workers. The wineries drew 1.5 million tourists in 2017 and at the same time used a third of the water.[51] Depending on the region, a vineyard needs between 10 and 24 inches of rain to survive. South Africas wineries have received on average half as much precipitation in the past year. The stress is being felt by industry where less water is causing smaller berries and therefore smaller yield. The industry also has a disproportionate profit with only about 1% return on investment despite producing some of the most popular wines in the world. ?The grape yield for 2018 could fall an estimated 20% from the 1.4 million tons produced in 2017, resulting in a 9% decrease in the volume of wine sold.[52]\\r\\nThe water crisis impacts organizations and industries that are not reliant on large volumes of water frothier core operations as well such as corporate offices. The World Economic Forums Global Risk Report 2015 [53] ranked the risk of a water crisis as the top risk in terms of impact. The cost of doing business in a drought affected area increases significantly. ?As workers move away or are evacuated from drought-affected areas the local economies suffer.\\r\\nHydrologic poverty tends to trap their people as they cannot afford to purchase food or water necessary for their society to become more affluent. An analyst estimates that with the current water crisis 300,000 jobs could be lost in agriculture and tens of thousands more in the service, hospitality and food sectors [29]. In Cape Town it is illegal to sell water from wells or rivers but people can still profit from the transport and labor. One resident who had been stockpiling water was charging $350 for a barrel of water. This is further alienating the more impoverished neighborhoods and citizens of getting necessary clean water. Those who are using over the allocated daily water are being fined between $41-$248 [29]. Yet this impact is further cementing the gap because the fine is likely insignificant for the wealthy and can be crippling for less affluent residents. Increases in hydrological poverty, by the reduction of available water, could increase deaths in Cape Town by 25 to 33 percent. [54]\\r\\nCape Town is governed by Mmusi Maimane, the leader of South Africas opposition party, the Democratic Alliance. Cape Town and Western Cape are the only province not run by the African National Congress (ANC) which has been in power since 1994. The tensions are high concerning many of the ANC would love to see the Democratic Alliance fail at the significant test ahead concerning the water crisis. Accusations of who has failed to act are being thrown by both sides [13] but it is clear both parties underestimated the magnitude of the problem. By taking control of the water crisis Maimane has pushed aside many constitutional structures set to separate party and state, complicating the situation and any reactions put in place. [55]\\r\\nThe Water Act of 1998 puts the national government as the public trustee of the nations water resources and must ensure that water is protected, used, developed, conserved, managed and controlled in a sustainable and equitable manner, for the benefit of all persons. It says: The National Government, acting through the Minister, has the power to regulate the use, flow and control of all water in the Republic.[56] With this both the local, provincial and national governments are responsible, yet with the unrest, working together has proved difficult.\\r\\nThis water crisis has increased research and investment in alternative water systems, which may ultimately help prevent other cities from falling into the same degree of water scarcity. ?As climate change continues and the population grows, moving into urban areas, other cities will also face severe drought and will need to assess alternative methods for obtaining water.[57]\\r\\nThe potential for a culture change in water usage is also a positive result of this crisis.\\r\\nThe city of Cape Town is currently working on constructing four new desalination plants as well as building new water wells and an effluent recycler. Although this solution seems obvious it is very costly and takes time to put in place. ?By January 2018, these projects were half way through completion. In addition, the city has been working on educating the public on reducing water consumption. This has lead to successful drop in water consumption by 50 percent from 2015 to early 2018.[58]\\r\\nIn addition, Cape Town is working on producing produce that accommodates the water availability of the region. ?This means they will be producing less rice and cotton, which are very water demanding.[16]","input":"Why there is water crisis in cape town?"},{"output":"proposes a solution to the animals' desperate plight on Manor Farm under the Jones administration and inspires thoughts of a rebellion","context":"Old Major (also called Willingdon Beauty, his name used when showing) is the first major character described by George Orwell in Animal Farm.

They became nearly extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle, but have made a recent resurgence largely restricted to a few national parks and reserves.  Their historical range roughly comprised a triangle between the Great Bear Lake in Canada's far northwest, south to the Mexican states of Durango and Nuevo Le܇n, and east to the Atlantic Seaboard of the United States (nearly to the Atlantic tidewater in some areas) from New York to Georgia and per some sources down to Florida. Bison were seen in North Carolina near Buffalo Ford on the Catawba River as late as 1750.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo subspecies or ecotypes have been described: the plains bison (B. b. bison), smaller in size and with a more rounded hump, and the wood bison (B. b. athabascae)the larger of the two and having a taller, square hump.[5][6][7][8][9][10] Furthermore, the plains bison has been suggested to consist of a northern plains (B. b. montanae) and a southern plains (B. b. bison) subspecies, bringing the total to three.[8] However, this is generally not supported. The wood bison is one of the largest wild species of bovid in the world, surpassed by only the Asian gaur and wild water buffalo. It is the largest extant land animal in the Americas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American bison is the national mammal of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term buffalo is sometimes considered to be a misnomer for this animal, and could be confused with \\"true\\" buffalos, the Asian water buffalo and the African buffalo. However, bison is a Greek word meaning ox-like animal, while buffalo originated with the French fur trappers who called these massive beasts b?ufs, meaning ox or bullockso both names, bison and buffalo, have a similar meaning. The name buffalo is listed in many dictionaries as an acceptable name for American buffalo or bison. Samuel de Champlain applied the term buffalo (buffles in French) to the bison in 1616 (published 1619), after seeing skins and a drawing shown to him by members of the Nipissing First Nation, who said they travelled forty days (from east of Lake Huron) to trade with another nation who hunted the animals.[11] In English usage, the term buffalo dates to 1625 in North America, when the term was first recorded for the American mammal.[12]  It thus has a much longer history than the term bison, which was first recorded in 1774.[13] The American bison is very closely related to the wisent or European bison.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Plains Indian languages in general, male and female buffaloes are distinguished, with each having a different designation rather than there being a single generic word covering both sexes. Thus:\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a distinction is not a general feature of the language (for example, Arapaho possesses gender-neutral terms for other large mammals such as elk, mule deer, etc.), and so presumably is due to the special significance of the buffalo in Plains Indian life and culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bison has a shaggy, long, dark-brown winter coat, and a lighter-weight, lighter-brown summer coat. As is typical in ungulates, the male bison is slightly larger than the female and, in some cases, can be considerably heavier. Plains bison are often in the smaller range of sizes, and wood bison in the larger range. Head-and-body lengths range from 2 to 3.5?m (6.6 to 11.5?ft) long, the tail adding 30 to 91?cm (12 to 36?in). Shoulder heights in the species can range from 152 to 186?cm (60 to 73?in). Weights can range from 318 to 1,000?kg (701 to 2,205?lb)[14][15][16] Typical weight ranges in the species were reported as 460 to 988?kg (1,014 to 2,178?lb) in males and 360 to 544?kg (794 to 1,199?lb) in females, the lowest weights probably representing typical weight around the age of sexual maturity at 2 to 3 years of age.[17] Mature bulls tend to be considerably larger than cows. Cow weights have had reported medians of 450 to 495?kg (992 to 1,091?lb), with one small sample averaging 479?kg (1,056?lb), whereas bulls may reportedly weigh a median of 730?kg (1,610?lb) with an average from a small sample of 765?kg (1,687?lb).[18][19][20][21] The heaviest wild bull ever recorded weighed 1,270?kg (2,800?lb).[22] When raised in captivity and farmed for meat, the bison can grow unnaturally heavy and the largest semidomestic bison weighed 1,724?kg (3,801?lb).[14] The heads and forequarters are massive, and both sexes have short, curved horns that can grow up to 2?ft (61?cm) long, which they use in fighting for status within the herd and for defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nBison are herbivores, grazing on the grasses and sedges of the North American prairies. Their daily schedule involves two-hour periods of grazing, resting, and cud chewing, then moving to a new location to graze again. Sexually mature young bulls may try to start mating with cows by the age of two or three years, but if more mature bulls are present, they may not be able to compete until they reach five years of age.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first two months of life, calves are lighter in color than mature bison. One very rare condition is the white buffalo, in which the calf turns entirely white.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough they are superficially similar, the American and European bison exhibit a number of physical and behavioral differences. Adult American bison are slightly heavier on average because of their less rangy build, and have shorter legs, which render them slightly shorter at the shoulder.[23] American bison tend to graze more, and browse less than their European relatives, because their necks are set differently. Compared to the nose of the American bison, that of the European species is set farther forward than the forehead when the neck is in a neutral position. The body of the American bison is hairier, though its tail has less hair than that of the European bison. The horns of the European bison point forward through the plane of its face, making it more adept at fighting through the interlocking of horns in the same manner as domestic cattle, unlike the American bison which favors charging.[24] American bison are more easily tamed than the European, and breed more readily with domestic cattle.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bovine family (taurids and bisonids) diverged from the common ancestral line with water buffalo and African buffalo about 5 to 10 million years ago.[26]  Thereafter, the family lineage of bison and taurine cattle does not appear to be a straightforward \\"tree\\" structure as is often depicted in much evolution, because evidence exists of interbreeding and crossbreeding between different species and members within this family, even many millions of years after their ancestors separated into different species.  This cross breeding was not sufficient to conflate the different species back together, but it has resulted in unexpected relationships between many members of this group, such as yak being related to American bison, when such relationships would otherwise not be apparent.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2003 study of mitochondrial DNA indicated four distinct maternal lineages in subtribe Bovina:\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Y chromosome analysis associated wisent and American bison.[28] An earlier study using amplified fragment length polymorphism  fingerprinting showed a close association of wisent and American bison and probably with yak, but noted that the interbreeding of Bovini species made determining relationships problematic.[29] It is shown, however, the wisent may have emerged by species divergence initiated by the introgression of bison bulls in a separate ancestral species,[30] the aurochs.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steppe bison (Bison priscus) diverged from the lineage that led to cattle (Bos taurus) about 2 to 5 million years ago.  The bison genus is clearly in the fossil record by 2 million years ago.[15] The steppe bison spread across Eurasia and was the bison that was pictured in the ancient cave paintings of Spain and Southern France.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European bison arose from the steppe bison, without fossil evidence of other ancestral species between the steppe bison and the European bison, though the European bison might have arisen from the lineage that led to American bison if that lineage backcrossed with the steppe bison.  Again, the web of relationships is confusing, but some evidence shows the European bison is descended from bison that had migrated from Asia to North America, and then back to Europe, where they crossbred with existing steppe bison.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one point, some steppe bison crossbred with the ancestors of the modern yak.  After that cross, a population of steppe bison (Bison priscus) crossed the Bering Land Bridge to North America.  Evidence has been found of multiple crossings of bison to and from Asia starting before 500,000 years ago and continuing until at least 220,000 years ago.  The steppe bison spread through the northern parts of North America and lived in Eurasia until roughly 11,000 years ago[32] and North America until 4,000 to 8,000 years ago.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nBison latifrons (giant bison or longhorn bison) is thought to have evolved in midcontinent North America from B. priscus, after the steppe bison crossed into North America.[33][34][35]  Giant bison (B. latifrons) appeared in the fossil record around 500,000 years ago.[15] B. latifrons was one of many species of North American megafauna which became extinct during the Quaternary extinction event. It is thought to have disappeared some 21,000ÿ30,000 years ago, during the late Wisconsin glaciation.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe B. latifrons species was replaced by the smaller Bison antiquus.  B. antiquus appeared in the North American fossil record approximately 250,000 years ago.[37] B. antiquus, in turn, evolved into  B. occidentalis, then into the yet smaller B. bisonthe modern American bisonsome 5,000 to 10,000 years ago.[38][39] Some researchers consider B. occidentalis to be a subspecies of B. antiquus.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the population bottleneck, after the great slaughter of American bison during the 1800s, the number of bison remaining alive in North America declined to as low as 541. During that period, a handful of ranchers gathered remnants of the existing herds to save the species from extinction. These ranchers bred some of the bison with cattle in an effort to produce \\"cattlo\\".[41] Accidental crossings were also known to occur. Generally, male domestic bulls were crossed with buffalo cows, producing offspring of which only the females were fertile. The crossbred animals did not demonstrate any form of hybrid vigor, so the practice was abandoned. The proportion of cattle DNA that has been measured in introgressed individuals and bison herds today is typically quite low, ranging from 0.56 to 1.8%.[41][42] In the United States, many ranchers are now using DNA testing to cull the residual cattle genetics from their bison herds. The U.S. National Bison Association has adopted a code of ethics which prohibits its members from deliberately crossbreeding bison with any other species.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite being the closest relatives of domestic cattle native to North America, bison were never domesticated by Native Americans. Later attempts of domestication by Europeans prior to the 20th century met with limited success. Bison were described as having a \\"wild and ungovernable temper\\";[43] they can jump close to 6?ft (1.8?m) vertically,[44] and run 35ÿ40?mph (56ÿ64?km/h) when agitated. This agility and speed, combined with their great size and weight, makes bison herds difficult to confine, as they can easily escape or destroy most fencing systems, including most razor wire.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 500,000 bison currently exist on private lands and around 30,000 on public lands which includes environmental and government preserves.[45] According to the IUCN, roughly 15,000 bison are considered wild, free-range bison not primarily confined by fencing.[46] In 2009, bison were reintroduced to the Janos Biosphere Reserve in northern Chihuahua; this is the only free-roaming herd on Mexican federal land. Efforts to bring back the bison population have recently reintroduced bison to Indiana,[47] which included the introduction of a herd consisting of 23 bison. In 2014, U.S Tribes and Canadian First Nations signed a treaty to help with the restoration of bison, the first to be signed in nearly 150 years.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican bison live in river valleys, and on prairies and plains.  Typical habitat is open or semiopen grasslands, as well as sagebrush, semiarid lands, and scrublands. Some lightly wooded areas are also known historically to have supported bison.  Bison also graze in hilly or mountainous areas where the slopes are not steep.  Though not particularly known as high-altitude animals, bison in the Yellowstone Park bison herd are frequently found at elevations above 8,000 feet and the Henry Mountains bison herd is found on the plains around the Henry Mountains, Utah, as well as in mountain valleys of the Henry Mountains to an altitude of 10,000 feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBison are increasingly raised for meat and hides; the majority of American bison in the world are raised for human consumption. Bison meat is generally considered to taste very similar to beef, but is lower in fat and cholesterol, yet higher in protein than beef,[49][50] which has led to the development of beefalo, a fertile hybrid of bison and domestic cattle.[citation needed] In 2005, about 35,000 bison were processed for meat in the U.S., with the National Bison Association and USDA providing a \\"Certified American Buffalo\\" program with birth-to-consumer tracking of bison via RFID ear tags. A market even exists for kosher bison meat; these bison are slaughtered at one of the few kosher mammal slaughterhouses in the U.S., and the meat is then distributed nationwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nBison are found in publicly and privately held herds. Custer State Park in South Dakota is home to 1,500 bison, one of the largest publicly held herds in the world, but some question the genetic purity of the animals. Wildlife officials believe that free roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in North America can be found only in the Yellowstone Park bison herd,[51] the Henry Mountains bison herd at the Book Cliffs and Henry Mountains in Utah, at Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota, Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana, Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary in the Northwest Territories, Elk Island National Park and Wood Buffalo National Park in Alberta, and Prince Albert National Park in Saskatchewan. Another population, the Antelope Island bison herd on Antelope Island in Utah, consisting of 550 to 700 bison, is also one of the largest and oldest public herds in the United States, but the bison in that herd are considered to be only semifree roaming, since they are confined to the Antelope Island.  In addition, recent genetic studies indicate that, like most bison herds, the Antelope Island bison herd has a small number of genes from domestic cattle. In 2002, the United States government donated some bison calves from South Dakota and Colorado to the Mexican government. Their descendants live in the Mexican nature reserves El Uno Ranch at Janos and Santa Elena Canyon, Chihuahua, and Boquillas del Carmen, Coahuila, located near the southern banks of the Rio Grande, and around the grassland state line with Texas and New Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent genetic studies of privately owned herds of bison show that many of them include animals with genes from domestic cattle.[51] For example, the herd on Santa Catalina Island, California, isolated since 1924 after being brought there for a movie shoot, were found to have cattle introgression.[52] As few as 12,000 to 15,000 pure bison are estimated to remain in the world. The numbers are uncertain because the tests used to datemitochondrial DNA analysisindicate only if the maternal line (back from mother to mother) ever included domesticated bovines, thus say nothing about possible male input in the process. Most hybrids were found to look exactly like purebred bison; therefore, appearance is not a good indicator of genetics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe size of the Canadian domesticated herd (genetic questions aside) grew dramatically through the 1990s and 2000s.  The 2006 Census of Agriculture reported the Canadian herd at 195,728 head, a 34.9% increase since 2001.[53]  Of this total, over 95% was located in Western Canada, and less than 5% in Eastern Canada.  Alberta was the province with the largest herd, accounting for 49.7% of the herd and 45.8% of the farms.  The next-largest herds were in Saskatchewan (23.9%), Manitoba (10%), and British Columbia (6%).  The main producing regions were in the northern parts of the Canadian prairies, specifically in the parkland belt, with the Peace River region (shared between Alberta and British Columbia) being the most important cluster, accounting for 14.4% of the national herd.[53]  Canada also exports bison meat, totaling 2,075,253 kilograms (4,575,150?lb) in 2006.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nA proposal known as Buffalo Commons has been suggested by a handful of academics and policymakers to restore large parts of the drier portion of the Great Plains to native prairie grazed by bison.[51]  Proponents argue that current agricultural use of the shortgrass prairie is not sustainable, pointing to periodic disasters, including the Dust Bowl, and continuing significant human population loss over the last 60 years. However, this plan is opposed by some who live in the areas in question.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBison are migratory and herd migrations can be directional as well as altitudinal in some areas.[55][56][57] Bison have usual daily movements between foraging sites during the summer. In a montane valley, bison have been recorded traveling, on average, 2 miles (3.2?km) per day.[57] The summer ranges of bison appear to be influenced by seasonal vegetation changes, interspersion and size of foraging sites, the rut, and the number of biting insects.[55] The size of preserve and availability of water may also be a factor.[57] Bison are largely grazers, eating primarily grasses and sedges. On shortgrass pasture, bison predominately consume warm-season grasses.[58] On mixed prairie, cool-season grasses, including some sedges, apparently compose 79ÿ96% of their diet.[59] In montane and northern areas, sedges are selected throughout the year.[55] Bison also drink water or consume snow on a daily basis.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nFemale bison live in maternal herds which include other females and their offspring. Male offspring leave their maternal herd when around three years old and either live alone or join other males in bachelor herds. Male and female herds usually do not mingle until the breeding season, which can occur from July through September.[60] However, female herds may also contain a few older males. During the breeding season, dominant bulls maintain a small harem of females for mating. Individual bulls \\"tend\\" cows until allowed to mate, by following them around and chasing away rival males. The tending bull shields the female's vision with his body so she will not see any other challenging males. A challenging bull may bellow or roar to get a female's attention and the tending bull has to bellow/roar back.[61] The most dominant bulls mate in the first 2ÿ3 weeks of the season.[61] More subordinate bulls mate with any remaining estrous cow that has not mated yet. Male bison play no part in raising the young.\\r\\n\\r\\nBison herds have dominance hierarchies that exist for both males and females. A bison's dominance is related to its birth date.[62] Bison born earlier in the breeding season are more likely to be larger and more dominant as adults.[62] Thus, bison are able to pass on their dominance to their offspring as dominant bison breed earlier in the season. In addition to dominance, the older bison of a generation also have a higher fertility rate than the younger ones.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nBison mate in August and September; gestation is 285 days. A single reddish-brown calf nurses until the next calf is born. If the cow is not pregnant, a calf will nurse for 18 months. Cows nurse their calves for at least 7 or 8 months, but most calves seem to be weaned before the end of their first year.[57] At three years of age, bison cows are mature enough to produce a calf.\\r\\n\\r\\nBison have a life expectancy around 15 years in the wild and up to 25 years in captivity.\\r\\n\\r\\nBison have been observed to display homosexual behaviors, males much more so than females. In the case of males, it is unlikely to be related to dominance, but rather to social bonding or gaining sexual experience.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nBison mate in late spring and summer in more open plain areas. During fall and winter, bison tend to gather in more wooded areas. During this time, bison partake in horning behaviors. They rub their horns against trees, young saplings, and even utility poles. Aromatic trees like cedars and pine seem to be preferred. Horning appears to be associated with insect defense, as it occurs most often in the fall when the insect population is at its highest.[64] Cedar and pines emit an aroma after bison horn them and this seems to be used as a deterrent for insects.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nA bison wallow is a shallow depression in the soil, which bison use either wet or dry. Bison roll in these depressions, covering themselves with dust or mud. Past and current hypotheses to explain the purpose of wallowing include grooming associated with shedding, male-male interaction (typically rutting), social behavior for group cohesion, play, relief from skin irritation due to biting insects, reduction of ectoparasite (tick and lice) load, and thermoregulation.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile often secure from predation because of their size and strength, in some areas, bison are regularly preyed upon by wolves. Wolf predation typically peaks in late spring and early summer, with attacks usually being concentrated on cows and calves. Wolves more actively target herds with calves than those without. The length of a predation episode varies, ranging from a few minutes to over nine hours.[66][67] Bison display five apparent defense strategies in protecting calves from wolves: running to a cow, running to a herd, running to the nearest bull, running in the front or center of a stampeding herd, and entering water bodies such as lakes or rivers. When fleeing wolves in open areas, cows with young calves take the lead, while bulls take to the rear of the herds, to guard the cows' escape. Bison typically ignore wolves not displaying hunting behavior.[68] Wolf packs specializing in bison tend to have more males, because their larger size than females allows them to wrestle prey to the ground more effectively.[69] Healthy, mature bulls in herds rarely fall prey. Grizzly bears can also pose a threat to calves and sometimes old, injured, or sick adult bison.\\r\\n\\r\\nBison are among the most dangerous animals encountered by visitors to the various North American national parks and will attack humans if provoked. They appear slow because of their lethargic movements, but can easily outrun humans; bison have been observed running as fast as 40?mph (64?km/h).\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1980 and 1999, more than three times as many people in Yellowstone National Park were injured by bison than by bears. During this period, bison charged and injured 79 people, with injuries ranging from goring puncture wounds and broken bones to bruises and abrasions. Bears injured 24 people during the same time. Three people died from the injuries inflictedone person by bison in 1983, and two people by bears in 1984 and 1986.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nBuffalo hunting (hunting of the American bison) was an activity fundamental to the Midwestern Native Americans, which was later adopted by American professional hunters as well as by the U.S. government to sabotage a central foodstuff of local tribes and force them into reservations, leading to the near-extinction of the species around 1890. It has since begun to recover.\\r\\n\\r\\nA major problem that bison face today is a lack of genetic diversity due to the population bottleneck the species experienced during its near-extinction event. Another genetic issue is the entry of genes from domestic cattle into the bison population, through hybridization.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficially, the \\"American buffalo\\" is classified by the United States government as a type of cattle, and the government allows private herds to be managed as such. This is a reflection of the characteristics that bison share with cattle.  Though the American bison is not only a separate species, but also is usually regarded as being in a separate genus from domestic cattle (Bos taurus), they clearly have a lot of genetic compatibility and American bison can interbreed with cattle, although only the female offspring are fertile in the first generation. These female hybrids can be bred back to either bison or domestic bulls, resulting in either 1/4 or 3/4 bison young. Female offspring from this cross are also fertile, but males are not reliably fertile unless they are either ?7?8 bison or ?7?8 domestic.[76] Moreover, when they do interbreed, crossbreed animals in the first generation tend to look very much like purebred bison, so appearance is completely unreliable as a means of determining what is a purebred bison and what is a crossbred cow.  Many ranchers have deliberately crossbred their cattle with bison, and some natural hybridization could be expected in areas where cattle and bison occur in the same range. Since cattle and bison eat similar food and tolerate similar conditions, they have often been in the same range together in the past, and opportunity for crossbreeding may sometimes have been common.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent decades, tests were developed to determine the source of mitochondrial DNA in cattle and bison, and most private \\"buffalo\\" herds were actually crossbred with cattle, and even most state and federal buffalo herds had some cattle DNA. With the advent of nuclear microsatellite DNA testing, the number of herds known to contain cattle genes has increased. Though about 500,000 bison exist on private ranches and in public herds, perhaps only 15,000 to 25,000 of these bison are pure and not actually bison-cattle hybrids. \\"DNA from domestic cattle (Bos taurus) has been detected in nearly all bison herds examined to date.\\"[77]  Significant public bison herds that do not appear to have hybridized domestic cattle genes are the Yellowstone Park bison herd, the Henry Mountains bison herd, which was started with bison taken from Yellowstone Park, the Wind Cave bison herd, and the Wood Buffalo National Park bison herd and subsidiary herds started from it, in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nA landmark study of bison genetics performed by James Derr of Texas A&M University corroborated this.[78] The Derr study was undertaken in an attempt to determine what genetic problems bison might face as they repopulate former areas, and it noted that bison seem to be adapting successfully, despite their apparent genetic bottleneck. One possible explanation for this might be the small amount of domestic cattle genes that are now in most bison populations, though this is not the only possible explanation for bison success.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the study, cattle genes were also found in small amounts throughout most national, state and private herds. \\"The hybridization experiments conducted by some of the owners of the five foundation herds of the late 1800s, have left a legacy of a small amount of cattle genetics in many of our existing bison herds.\\" He also said, \\"All of the state owned bison herds tested (except for possibly one) contain animals with domestic cattle mtDNA.\\"[78]  It appears that the one state herd that had no cattle genes was the Henry Mountains bison herd; the Henry Mountain herd was started initially with transplanted animals from Yellowstone Park. However, the extension of this herd into the Book Cliffs of central Utah involved mixing the founders with additional bison from another source, so it is not known if the Book Cliffs extension of the herd is also free of cattle hybridization.\\r\\n\\r\\nA separate study by Wilson and Strobeck, published in Genome, was done to define the relationships between different herds of bison in the United States and Canada, and to determine whether the bison at Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada and the Yellowstone Park bison herd were possibly separate subspecies. The Wood Buffalo Park bison were determined to actually be crossbreeds between plains and wood bison, but their predominant genetic makeup was that of the expected \\"wood buffalo\\".[9]  However, the Yellowstone Park bison herd was pure plains bison, and not any of the other previously suggested subspecies. Another finding was that the bison in the Antelope Island herd in Utah appeared to be more distantly related to other plains bison in general than any other plains bison group that was tested, though this might be due to genetic drift caused by the small size of only 12 individuals in the founder population. A side finding of this was that the Antelope Island bison herd appears to be most closely related to the Wood Buffalo National Park bison herd, though the Antelope Island bison are actually plains bison.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first thoroughfares of North America, except for the time-obliterated paths of mastodon or muskox and the routes of the mound builders, were the traces made by bison and deer in seasonal migration and between feeding grounds and salt licks. Many of these routes, hammered by countless hoofs instinctively following watersheds and the crests of ridges in avoidance of lower places' summer muck and winter snowdrifts, were followed by the aboriginal North Americans as courses to hunting grounds and as warriors' paths. They were invaluable to explorers and were adopted by pioneers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBison traces were characteristically north and south, but several key east-west trails were used later as railways. Some of these include the Cumberland Gap through the Blue Ridge Mountains to upper Kentucky. A heavily used trace crossed the Ohio River at the Falls of the Ohio and ran west, crossing the Wabash River near Vincennes, Indiana. In Senator Thomas Hart Benton's phrase saluting these sagacious path-makers, the bison paved the way for the railroads to the Pacific.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong Native American tribes, especially the Plains Indians, the bison is considered a sacred animal and religious symbol.  According to University of Montana anthropology and Native American studies professor S. Neyooxet Greymorning, \\"The creation stories of where buffalo came from put them in a very spiritual place among many tribes.  The buffalo crossed many different areas and functions, and it was utilized in many ways. It was used in ceremonies, as well as to make tipi covers that provided homes for people, utensils, shields, weapons and parts were used for sewing with the sinew.\\"[80]  The Sioux consider the birth of a white buffalo to be the return of White Buffalo Calf Woman, their primary cultural prophet and the bringer of their \\"Seven Sacred Rites\\".  Among the Mandan and Hidatsa, the White Buffalo Cow Society was the most sacred of societies for women.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American bison is often used in North America in official seals, flags, and logos. In 2016, the American bison became the national mammal of the United States.[81] The bison is a popular symbol in the Great Plains states: Kansas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming have adopted the animal as their official state mammal, and many sports teams have chosen the bison as their mascot. In Canada, the bison is the official animal of the province of Manitoba and appears on the Manitoba flag. It is also used in the official coat of arms of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral American coins feature the bison, most famously on the reverse side of the \\"buffalo nickel\\" from 1913 to 1938. In 2005, the United States Mint coined a nickel with a new depiction of the bison as part of its \\"Westward Journey\\" series. The Kansas and North Dakota state quarters, part of the \\"50 State Quarter\\" series, each feature bison. The Kansas state quarter has only the bison and does not feature any writing, while the North Dakota state quarter has two bison. The Montana state quarter prominently features a bison skull over a landscape. The Yellowstone National Park quarter also features a bison standing next to a geyser.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther institutions which have adopted the bison as a symbol or mascot include:","input":"What was the original range of the american bison?"},{"output":"Lord Daniel Sinderby","context":"James Sebastian Faulkner (born 18 July 1948) is an English actor, known for his many various appearance on television, in video games and in films, usually in supporting roles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving trained as a chorister from the age of seven at the Royal College of Church Music at Addington Palace, he was a permanent member of the choir and often called upon as a soloist.

Masses of ice covering less than 50,000?km2 are termed an ice cap. An ice cap will typically feed a series of glaciers around its periphery.\\r\\nAlthough the surface is cold, the base of an ice sheet is generally warmer due to geothermal heat. In places, melting occurs and the melt-water lubricates the ice sheet so that it flows more rapidly. This process produces fast-flowing channels in the ice sheet? these are ice streams.\\r\\nThe present-day polar ice sheets are relatively young in geological terms. The Antarctic Ice Sheet first formed as a small ice cap (maybe several) in the early Oligocene, but retreating and advancing many times until the Pliocene, when it came to occupy almost all of Antarctica. The Greenland ice sheet did not develop at all until the late Pliocene, but apparently developed very rapidly with the first continental glaciation. This had the unusual effect of allowing fossils of plants that once grew on present-day Greenland to be much better preserved than with the slowly forming Antarctic ice sheet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Antarctic ice sheet is the largest single mass of ice on Earth. It covers an area of almost 14 million km2 and contains 30 million km3 of ice. Around 90% of the Earth's ice mass is in Antarctica,[3] which, if melted, would cause sea levels to rise by 58 meters.[4] The continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is positive and significant at >0.05?C/decade since 1957.[5]\\r\\nThe Antarctic ice sheet is divided by the Transantarctic Mountains into two unequal sections called the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS) and the smaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The EAIS rests on a major land mass but the bed of the WAIS is, in places, more than 2,500 metres below sea level. It would be seabed if the ice sheet were not there. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the Ross Ice Shelf, the Ronne Ice Shelf, and outlet glaciers that drain into the Amundsen Sea.\\r\\nThe Greenland ice sheet occupies about 82% of the surface of Greenland, and if melted would cause sea levels to rise by 7.2 metres.[4] Estimated changes in the mass of Greenland's ice sheet suggest it is melting at a rate of about 239 cubic kilometres (57 cubic miles) per year.[7] These measurements came from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite, launched in 2002, as reported by BBC News in August 2006.[8]\\r\\nIce movement is dominated by the motion of glaciers, whose activity is determined by a number of processes.[9] Their motion is the result of cyclic surges interspersed with longer periods of inactivity, on both hourly and centennial time scales.\\r\\nThe Greenland, and possibly the Antarctic, ice sheets have been losing mass recently, because losses by ablation including outlet glaciers exceed accumulation of snowfall. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), loss of Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet mass contributed, respectively, about 0.21 I 0.35 and 0.21 I 0.07?mm/year to sea level rise between 1993 and 2003.[10]\\r\\nThe IPCC projects that ice mass loss from melting of the Greenland ice sheet will continue to outpace accumulation of snowfall. Accumulation of snowfall on the Antarctic ice sheet is projected to outpace losses from melting. However, in the words of the IPCC, \\"Dynamical processes related to ice flow not included in current models but suggested by recent observations could increase the vulnerability of the ice sheets to warming, increasing future sea level rise. Understanding of these processes is limited and there is no consensus on their magnitude.\\" More research work is therefore required to improve the reliability of predictions of ice-sheet response on global warming. In 2018, scientists discovered channels between the East and West Antarctic ice sheets that may allow melted ice to flow more quickly to the sea.[11]\\r\\nThe effects on ice sheets due to increasing temperature may accelerate, but as documented by the IPCC the effects are not easily projected accurately and in the case of the Antarctic, may trigger an accumulation of additional ice mass. If an ice sheet were ablated down to bare ground, less light from the sun would be reflected back into space and more would be absorbed by the land. The Greenland Ice Sheet covers 84% of the island and the Antarctic Ice Sheet covers approximately 98% of the continent. Due to the significant thickness of these ice sheets, global warming analysis typically focuses on the loss of ice mass from the ice sheets increasing sea level rise, and not on a reduction in the surface area of the ice sheets.","input":"Where is the worlds largest ice sheet located?"},{"output":"PewDiePie","context":"This list of most-subscribed YouTube channels contains the top 50 channels with the most subscribers on the video platform YouTube.[1] The ability to \\"subscribe\\" to a user's channel was added to YouTube by late October 2005,[2] and the \\"most subscribed\\" list on YouTube began as a chart by May 2006, at which time Smosh was number one with fewer than 3,000 subscribers.[3] Since December 22, 2013, the most subscribed user has been PewDiePie with 57 million subscribers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table lists the top 50 most subscribed channels on YouTube, with each total rounded down to the nearest million subscribers, as well as the network, country and language of each channel.

In its 35-year history, the show primarily featured performances by R&B, soul, dance/pop and hip hop artists, although funk, jazz, disco and gospel artists also appeared. The series was created by Don Cornelius, who also served as its first host and executive producer.\\r\\nProduction was suspended following the 2005ÿ2006 season, with a rerun package (known as The Best of Soul Train) airing for two years subsequently. As a nod to Soul Train's longevity, the show's opening sequence during later seasons contained a claim that it was the \\"longest-running first-run, nationally syndicated program in American television history,\\" with over 1,100 episodes produced from the show's debut through the 2005ÿ2006 season. Despite the production hiatus, Soul Train held that superlative until 2016, when Entertainment Tonight surpassed it completing its 35th season. Among non-news programs, Wheel of Fortune will surpass it in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origins of Soul Train can be traced to 1965 when WCIU-TV, an upstart UHF station in Chicago, began airing two youth-oriented dance programs: Kiddie-a-Go-Go and Red Hot and Blues. These programsspecifically the latter, which featured a predominantly African-American group of in-studio dancerswould set the stage for what was to come to the station several years later. Don Cornelius, a news reader and backup disc jockey at Chicago radio station WVON, was hired by WCIU in 1967 as a news and sports reporter. Cornelius also was promoting and emceeing a touring series of concerts featuring local talent (sometimes called \\"record hops\\") at Chicago-area high schools, calling his traveling caravan of shows \\"The Soul Train\\". WCIU-TV took notice of Cornelius's outside work and in 1970, allowed him the opportunity to bring his road show to television.\\r\\nAfter securing a sponsorship deal with the Chicago-based retailer Sears, Roebuck & Co., Soul Train premiered on WCIU-TV on August 17, 1970, as a live show airing weekday afternoons. The first episode of the program featured Jerry Butler, the Chi-Lites, and the Emotions as guests. Cornelius was assisted by Clinton Ghent, a local professional dancer who appeared on early episodes before moving behind the scenes as a producer and secondary host.[1]\\r\\nThe program's immediate success attracted the attention of another locally based firmthe Johnson Products Company (manufacturers of the Afro Sheen line of hair-care products)and they later agreed to co-sponsor the program's expansion into national syndication. Cornelius and Soul Train's syndicator targeted 24 markets outside of Chicago to carry the show, but stations in only eight other citiesAtlanta, Birmingham, Cleveland, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and San Franciscopurchased the program, which began airing on a weekly basis on October 2, 1971. By the end of the first season, Soul Train was on in the other sixteen markets.[2] When the program moved into syndication, its home base was also shifted to Los Angeles, where it remained for the duration of its run. Soul Train was part of a national trend toward syndicated music-oriented programs targeted at niche audiences; two other network series (Hee Haw for country music, and The Lawrence Welk Show for traditional music) also entered syndication in 1971 and would go on to have long runs.\\r\\nThough Don Cornelius moved his operations west, Soul Train continued in Chicago as a local program. Cornelius hosted the local Chicago and Los Angelesÿbased national programs simultaneously, but soon focused his attention solely on the national edition. He continued to oversee production in Chicago, where Clinton Ghent hosted episodes on WCIU-TV until 1976, followed by three years of once-weekly reruns.[3] The syndicated version was picked up in Chicago by CBS-owned WBBM-TV at its launch; the program moved to WGN-TV in 1977 and remained there for the rest of its run.\\r\\nIn 1985, Chicago-based Tribune Entertainment (WGN's syndication wing) took over Soul Train's syndication contract; the series would continue distribution through Tribune for the rest of its original run.\\r\\nMost of the stations that aired Soul Train during the final 13 years were either Fox affiliates or independent stations that would later become WB network affiliates, UPN affiliates or both dual WB/UPN affiliates.\\r\\nDon Cornelius ended his run as host at the end of the show's 22nd season in 1993, though he remained the show's main creative force from behind the scenes. The following fall, Soul Train began using various guest hosts weekly until comedian Mystro Clark began a two-year stint as permanent host in 1997. Clark was replaced by actor Shemar Moore in 2000. In 2003, Moore was succeeded by actor Dorian Gregory, who hosted through 2006.\\r\\nSoul Train pulled into its last stop when production of first-run episodes was suspended at the conclusion of the 2005ÿ06 season, the show's 35th. Instead, for two seasons starting in 2006ÿ07, the program aired archived episodes (all from between 1973 and 1988) under the title The Best of Soul Train.[4] This was because in later years, Nielsen ratings dropped to below 1.0; in the process, some of the stations which had been airing Soul Train on Saturday afternoons started rescheduling the program to overnight time slots. The future of Soul Train was uncertain with the announced closing of Tribune Entertainment in December 2007, which left Don Cornelius Productions to seek a new distributor for the program.[5] Cornelius soon secured a deal with Trifecta Entertainment & Media.\\r\\nWhen Don Cornelius Productions still owned the program, clips of the show's performances and interviews were kept away from online video sites such as YouTube owing to copyright infringement claims.[citation needed] Cornelius also frowned upon unauthorized distribution of Soul Train episodes through the sale of third-party VHS or DVD compilations.\\r\\nIn May 2008, Cornelius sold the rights to the Soul Train library to MadVision Entertainment, whose principal partners came from the entertainment and publishing fields. The price and terms of the deal were not disclosed.[6] However, by the start of the 2008ÿ09 television season, the Tribune Broadcasting-owned stations (including national carrier WGN America) that had been the linchpin of the show's syndication efforts dropped the program, and many others followed suit. Soul Train's website acknowledged that the program had ceased distribution on September 22, 2008.\\r\\nFollowing the purchase by MadVision, the Soul Train archives were exposed to new forms of distribution. In April 2009, MadVision launched a Soul Train channel on YouTube. Three months later, the company entered into a licensing agreement with TimeÿLife to distribute Soul Train DVD sets.[7][8] MadVision then came to terms with Viacom-owned Black Entertainment Television to relaunch the Soul Train Music Awards for BET's new spin-off channel, Centric, in November 2009, a move that may be one step into reviving the program. Centric, which launched on September 28, 2009, is currently broadcasting archived episodes of the program. Archived episodes of the series can also be seen on Bounce TV, an Atlanta-based television network that launched on September 26, 2011.\\r\\nMadVision sold the rights to Soul Train to a consortium led by basketball player Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson and backed by private equity firm InterMedia Partners in 2011. The Johnson-InterMedia consortium plans on a potential film project Cornelius had briefly mentioned prior to selling the franchise, as well as producing potential stage adaptations and a cruise.[9] As part of the sale, Johnson's Aspire TV channel also began airing reruns of the series.\\r\\nCornelius continued to appear for Soul Train documentaries and ceremonies up until his death from suicide in February 2012. In 2013, a cruise-based revival, called the Soul Train Cruise, began taking place; the cruise is presented by Centric.[10]\\r\\nSome commentators have called Soul Train a \\"black American Bandstand,\\" another long-running program with which Soul Train shares some similarities. Cornelius acknowledged Bandstand as a model for his program; as the years advanced and Soul Train evolved into a tradition in its own right, he tended to bristle at the Bandstand comparisons.[11]\\r\\nIn 1973, Dick Clark, host and producer of Bandstand, launched Soul Unlimited  controversial for its pronounced racial overtures  to compete directly with Soul Train. Cornelius, with help from Jesse Jackson, openly accused Clark of trying to undermine TV's only Black-owned show. Agreeing, ABC canceled it after a few episodes. Clark later agreed to work with Cornelius on a series of network specials featuring R&B and soul artists.[12]\\r\\nCornelius was relatively conservative in his musical tastes and was admittedly not a fan of the emerging hip hop genre, believing that the genre did not reflect positively on African-American culture (one of his stated goals for the series). Even though Cornelius would feature rap artists on Soul Train frequently during the 1980s, he publicly would admit (to the artists' faces such as Kurtis Blow) that the genre was one that he did not understand; as rap continued to move further toward hardcore hip hop, Cornelius would admit to be frightened by the antics of groups such as Public Enemy. Rosie Perez testified in the 2010 VH1 documentary Soul Train: The Hippest Trip in America that Cornelius also disliked seeing the show's dancers perform sexually suggestive \\"East Coast\\" dance moves. Cornelius admittedly had rap artists on the show only because the genre was becoming popular among his African-American audience, though the decision alienated middle-aged, more affluent African Americans like himself. This disconnect (which was openly mocked in an In Living Color sketch where Cornelius and the show were lampooned as extremely old and out of touch) eventually led to Cornelius's stepping down as host in the early 1990s and the show's losing its influence.[13]\\r\\nAhmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson, drummer for hip-hop band The Roots and a fan of the program, authored Soul Train: The Music, Dance, and Style of a Generation. ISBN?978-0-0622-8838-7.?, which was published in 2013.[14]\\r\\nWithin the structure of the program, there were two enduring elements. The first was the \\"Soul Train Scramble Board\\", where two dancers are given 60 seconds to unscramble a set of letters that form the name of that show's performer or a notable person in African American history. In describing the person's renown, the host concluded their description with the phrase \\"...whose name you should know\\". Cornelius openly admitted after the series ended its run that the game was usually set up so everybody won in an effort not to cause embarrassment for the show or African Americans in general.\\r\\nThere was also the popular \\"Soul Train Line\\" (a variant of the 1950s fad then known as The Stroll), in which all the dancers form two lines with a space in the middle for dancers to strut down and dance in consecutive order. Originally, this consisted of a couplewith men on one side and women on the other. In later years, men and women had their own individual lineups. Sometimes, new dance styles or moves were featured or introduced by particular dancers. In addition, there was an in-studio group of dancers who danced along to the music as it was being performed. Rosie Perez, Damita Jo Freeman, Darnell Williams, Cheryl Song, Louie \\"Ski\\" Carr, Alfie Lewis, Alise Mekhail, Andrea N. Miles, Carmen Electra, Nick Cannon, MC Hammer, Jermaine Stewart, Heather Hunter, Fred \\"Rerun\\" Berry, Laurieann Gibson, Pebbles, and NFL legend Walter Payton were among those who got noticed dancing on the program over the years. Two former dancers, Jody Watley and Jeffrey Daniel, enjoyed years of success as members of the R&B group Shalamar after they were chosen by Soul Train talent booker/record promoter Dick Griffey and Cornelius to replace the group's original session singers in 1978.[15]\\r\\nEach guest usually performed twice on each program; after their first number, they were joined by the program host onstage for a brief interview. The show was also known for two popular catchphrases, referring to itself as the \\"hippest trip in America\\" at the beginning of the show and closing the program with \\"...and you can bet your last money, it's gonna be a stone gas, honey. I'm Don Cornelius, and as always in parting, we wish you love, peace...and SOUL!\\"\\r\\nIn 1985, Cornelius gave permission for a version of the show in the United Kingdom. The UK version, hosted by former \\"Soul Train\\" dancer Jeffrey Daniel, was titled 620 Soul Train and only lasted one series.\\r\\nIn 1987, Soul Train launched the Soul Train Music Awards, which honors the top performances in R&B, hip hop, and gospel music (and, in its earlier years, jazz music) from the previous year.\\r\\nSoul Train then produced the short-lived Soul Train Comedy Awards in 1993, which discontinued that same year.[16][17][18]\\r\\nSoul Train later created two additional annual specials: The Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards, first airing in 1995, celebrated top achievements by female performers; and the Soul Train Christmas Starfest, which premiered in 1998, featured holiday music performed by a variety of R&B and gospel artists. Award categories for the Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards presented to female recipients included:[19]\\r\\nSpecial awards given were The Aretha Franklin Award for Entertainer of the Year, and The Lena Horne Award for Outstanding Career Achievements.[19]\\r\\nThe Lady of Soul Awards and Christmas Starfest programs last aired in 2005. In April 2008, Don Cornelius announced that year's Soul Train Music Awards ceremony had been canceled. Cornelius cited the three-month strike by the Writers Guild of America as one of the reasons, though a main factor may have been the uncertainty surrounding Soul Train's future. Cornelius also announced that a motion picture based on the program was in development.[20] However, subsequent owners of the franchise have followed their own agenda for the program, which included a revival of the Soul Train Music Awards as of 2009.\\r\\nSoul Train used various original and current music for theme songs during its run, including","input":"When did soul train go off the air?"},{"output":"poultry","context":"Kentucky is an agricultural producer in the United States.

In size and shape, it closely resembles Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Due to its thick waxy coating, M. leprae stains with a carbol fuchsin rather than with the traditional Gram stain. The culture takes several weeks to mature.\\r\\nOptical microscopy shows M. leprae in clumps, rounded masses, or in groups of bacilli side by side, and ranging from 1ÿ8 m in length and 0.2ÿ0.5 m in diameter.[3]\\r\\nIt was discovered in 1873 by the Norwegian physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen, who was searching for the bacteria in the skin nodules of patients with leprosy. It was the first bacterium to be identified as causing disease in humans.[4][5][verification needed] The organism has never been successfully grown on an artificial cell culture medium.[2] Instead, it has been grown in mouse foot pads and more recently in nine-banded armadillos because they, like humans, are susceptible to leprosy. This can be used as a diagnostic test for the presence of bacilli in body lesions of suspected leprosy patients. The difficulty in culturing the organism appears to be because it is an obligate intracellular parasite that lacks many necessary genes for independent survival. The complex and unique cell wall that makes members of the Mycobacterium genus difficult to destroy is apparently also the reason for the extremely slow replication rate.\\r\\nVirulence factors include a waxy exterior coating, formed by the production of mycolic acids unique to Mycobacterium.\\r\\nMycobacterium leprae was sensitive to dapsone (diaminodiphenylsulfone, the first effective treatment which was discovered for leprosy in the 1940s), but resistance against this antibiotic has developed over time. Therapy with dapsone alone is now strongly contraindicated. Currently, a multidrug treatment (MDT) is recommended by the World Health Organization, including dapsone, rifampicin and clofazimine. In patients receiving the MDT, a high proportion of the bacilli die within a short amount of time without immediate relief of symptoms. This suggests many symptoms of leprosy must be due in part to the presence of dead cells.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe incubation period of M. leprae can range between nine months and twenty years.[6] It replicates intracellularly inside histiocytes and nerve cells and has two forms. One form is tuberculoid, which induces a cell-mediated response that limits its growth. Through this form M. leprae multiplies at the site of entry, usually the skin, invading and colonizing Schwann cells. The microbe then induces T-helper lymphocytes, epitheloid cells, and giant cell infiltration of the skin, causing infected individuals to exhibit large flattened patches with raised and elevated red edges on their skin. These patches have dry, pale, hairless centers, accompanied by a loss of sensation on the skin. The loss of sensation may develop as a result of invasion of the peripheral sensory nerves. The macule at the cutaneous site of entry and the loss of pain sensation are key clinical indications that an individual has a tuberculoid form of leprosy.\\r\\nThe second form of leprosy is the lepromatous form. This form of the microbe proliferates within the macrophages at the site of entry. It also grows within the epithelial tissues of the face and ear lobes. The suppressor T-cells that are induced are numerous, however the epithelioid and giant cells are rare or absent. With cell-mediated immunity impaired, large numbers of M. leprae appear in the macrophages and the infected patients develop papules at the entry site, marked by a folding of the skin. Gradual destruction of cutaneous nerves lead to what is referred to as \\"classic lion face\\". Extensive penetration of this microbe may lead to severe body damage; for example the loss of bones, fingers, and toes.\\r\\nMycobacterium leprae has the longest doubling time of all known bacteria and has thwarted every effort at culture in the laboratory.[7] Comparing the genome sequence of M. leprae with that of M. tuberculosis provides clear explanations for these properties, and reveals an extreme case of reductive evolution. Less than half of the genome contains functional genes. Gene deletion and decay appear to have eliminated many important metabolic activities, including siderophore production, part of the oxidative and most of the microaerophilic and anaerobic respiratory chains, and numerous catabolic systems and their regulatory circuits.[8]\\r\\nThe first genome sequence of a strain of M. leprae, was completed in 1998.[8] The genome sequence of a strain originally isolated in Tamil Nadu, India and designated TN, was completed in 2013. The sequence was obtained by a combined approach, employing automated DNA sequence analysis of selected cosmids and whole-genome 'shotgun' clones. After the finishing process, the genome sequence was found to contain 3,268,203 base pairs (bp), and to have an average G+C content of 57.8%, values much lower than the corresponding values for M. tuberculosis, which are 4, 441,529 bp and 65.6% G+C.[9]\\r\\nMycobacterium leprae has undergone a dramatic reduction in genome size with the loss of many genes. This genome reduction is not complete and numerous genes are still present as non-functional pseudogenes. Downsizing from a genome of 4.42 Mbp, such as that of M. tuberculosis, to one of 3.27 Mbp would account for the loss of some 1200 protein-coding sequences. There is evidence that many of the genes that were present in the genome of the common ancestor of M. leprae and M. tuberculosis have been lost in the M. leprae genome.[10] 1500 genes are still common to both M. leprae and M. tuberculosis.\\r\\nInformation from the completed genome can be useful to develop diagnostic skin tests, to understand the mechanisms of nerve damage and drug resistance and to identify novel drug targets for rational design of new therapeutic regimens and drugs to treat leprosy and its complications.\\r\\nAlmost complete sequences of M. leprae from medieval skeletons with osteological lesions suggestive of leprosy from different Europe geographic origins were obtained using DNA capture techniques and high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Ancient sequences were compared with those of modern strains from biopsies of leprosy patients representing diverse genotypes and geographic origins, giving new insights in the understanding of evolution, course through history, phylogeography of the leprosy bacillus and the disappearance of leprosy from Europe\\r\\nVerena J. Schuenemann et al. demonstrated a remarkable genomic conservation during the past 1000 years and a close similarity between modern and ancient strains, suggesting that the sudden decline of leprosy in Europe was not due to a losing of virulence but due to extraneous factors, such as other infectious diseases, changes in host immunity or improved social conditions.[11]\\r\\nThe geographic occurrence of M. leprae include: Angola, Brazil, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Federated States of Micronesia, India, Kiribati, Madagascar, Nepal, Republic of Marshall Islands, and United Republic of Tanzania.[12]\\r\\nThe closest relative to Mycobacterium leprae is Mycobacterium lepromatosis.[13] These species diverged 13.9?million years ago (95% highest posterior density 8.2?million years ago ÿ 21.4?million years ago ) The most recent common ancestor of the extant M. leprae strains was calculated to have lived 3,607 years ago [95% highest posterior density 2204ÿ5525 years ago]. The estimated mutation rate was The estimated substitution rate was 7.67 x 10?9 substitutions per site per year - similar to other bacteria.\\r\\nA study of genomes isolated from medieval cases estimated the mutation rate to be 6.13 G 10?9.[14] The authors also showed that the leprosy bacillus in the Americas was brought there from Europe.\\r\\nIt has been estimated that the ancestors of M. leprae and M. tuberculosis separated 36?million years ago.[15]\\r\\nAnother study suggested that M. leprae originated in East Africa and spread from there to Europe and the Middle East initially before spreading to West Africa and the Americas in the last 500 years.[16]\\r\\nDiagnostic criteria for leprosy: The diagnosis of leprosy is primarily a clinical one. In one Ethiopian study, the following criteria had a sensitivity of 94% with a positive predictive value of 98% in diagnosing leprosy. Diagnosis was based on one or more of three signs:\\r\\nMultidrug therapy (MDT). Antibiotics that destroy M. leprae bacilli include: dapsone, rifampin, clofazamine, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and minocycline.\\r\\nA preventative measure of M. leprae is to avoid close contact with infectious people who are untreated.[17] The Bacillus CalmetteÿGurin (BCG) vaccine offers a variable amount of protection against leprosy in addition to its main target of tuberculosis.[18] Armadillos are also known hosts for Mycobacterium leprae and have infected humans in the southeastern United States, although the geographic range of the disease and its complexity has been spreading.[19]","input":"Where is mycobacterium leprae most likely to be found?"},{"output":"fluorine","context":"Electronegativity, symbol , is a chemical property that describes the tendency of an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons (or electron density) towards itself.[1] An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance at which its valence electrons reside from the charged nucleus. The higher the associated electronegativity number, the more an element or compound attracts electrons towards it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"electronegativity\\" was introduced by J?ns Jacob Berzelius in 1811,[2]\\r\\nthough the concept was known even before that and was studied by many chemists including Avogadro.[2]\\r\\nIn spite of its long history, an accurate scale of electronegativity was not developed until 1932, when Linus Pauling proposed an electronegativity scale, which depends on bond energies, as a development of valence bond theory.[3] It has been shown to correlate with a number of other chemical properties. Electronegativity cannot be directly measured and must be calculated from other atomic or molecular properties. Several methods of calculation have been proposed, and although there may be small differences in the numerical values of the electronegativity, all methods show the same periodic trends between elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most commonly used method of calculation is that originally proposed by Linus Pauling. This gives a dimensionless quantity, commonly referred to as the Pauling scale (r), on a relative scale running from around 0.7 to 3.98 (hydrogen?= 2.20). When other methods of calculation are used, it is conventional (although not obligatory) to quote the results on a scale that covers the same range of numerical values: this is known as an electronegativity in Pauling units.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it is usually calculated, electronegativity is not a property of an atom alone, but rather a property of an atom in a molecule.[4] Properties of a free atom include ionization energy and electron affinity. It is to be expected that the electronegativity of an element will vary with its chemical environment,[5] but it is usually considered to be a transferable property, that is to say that similar values will be valid in a variety of situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the most basic level, electronegativity is determined by factors like the nuclear charge (the more protons an atom has, the more \\"pull\\" it will have on electrons) and the number/location of other electrons present in the atomic shells (the more electrons an atom has, the farther from the nucleus the valence electrons will be, and as a result the less positive charge they will experienceboth because of their increased distance from the nucleus, and because the other electrons in the lower energy core orbitals will act to shield the valence electrons from the positively charged nucleus).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opposite of electronegativity is electropositivity: a measure of an element's ability to donate electrons.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaesium is the least electronegative element in the periodic table (=0.79), while fluorine is most electronegative (=3.98). Francium and caesium were originally both assigned 0.7; caesium's value was later refined to 0.79, but no experimental data allows a similar refinement for francium. However, francium's ionization energy is known to be slightly higher than caesium's, in accordance with the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital, and this in turn implies that francium is in fact more electronegative than caesium.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nValues are given for the elements in their most common and stable oxidation states.See also: Electronegativities of the elements (data page)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPauling first proposed[3] the concept of electronegativity in 1932 as an explanation of the fact that the covalent bond between two different atoms (AÿB) is stronger than would be expected by taking the average of the strengths of the AÿA and BÿB bonds. According to valence bond theory, of which Pauling was a notable proponent, this \\"additional stabilization\\" of the heteronuclear bond is due to the contribution of ionic  canonical forms to the bonding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difference in electronegativity between atoms A and B is given by:\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere the dissociation energies, Ed, of the AÿB, AÿA and BÿB bonds are expressed in electronvolts, the factor (eV)??1?2 being included to ensure a dimensionless result. Hence, the difference in Pauling electronegativity between hydrogen and bromine is 0.73 (dissociation energies: HÿBr, 3.79?eV; HÿH, 4.52?eV; BrÿBr 2.00?eV)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs only differences in electronegativity are defined, it is necessary to choose an arbitrary reference point in order to construct a scale. Hydrogen was chosen as the reference, as it forms covalent bonds with a large variety of elements: its electronegativity was fixed first[3] at 2.1, later revised[7] to 2.20. It is also necessary to decide which of the two elements is the more electronegative (equivalent to choosing one of the two possible signs for the square root). This is usually done using \\"chemical intuition\\": in the above example, hydrogen bromide dissolves in water to form H+ and Br? ions, so it may be assumed that bromine is more electronegative than hydrogen. However, in principle, since the same electronegativities should be obtained for any two bonding compounds, the data are in fact overdetermined, and the signs are unique once a reference point is fixed (usually, for H or F).\\r\\n\\r\\nTo calculate Pauling electronegativity for an element, it is necessary to have data on the dissociation energies of at least two types of covalent bond formed by that element. A. L. Allred updated Pauling's original values in 1961 to take account of the greater availability of thermodynamic data,[7] and it is these \\"revised Pauling\\" values of the electronegativity that are most often used.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe essential point of Pauling electronegativity is that there is an underlying, quite accurate, semi-empirical formula for dissociation energies, namely:\\r\\n\\r\\nor sometimes, a more accurate fit\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an approximate equation, but holds with good accuracy. Pauling obtained it by noting that a bond can be approximately represented as a quantum mechanical superposition of a covalent bond and two ionic bond-states. The covalent energy of a bond is approximately, by quantum mechanical calculations, the geometric mean of the two energies of covalent bonds of the same molecules, and there is an additional energy that comes from ionic factors, i.e. polar character of the bond.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe geometric mean is approximately equal to the arithmetic mean - which is applied in the first formula above - when the energies are of the similar value, e.g., except for the highly electropositive elements, where there is a larger difference of two dissociation energies; the geometric mean is more accurate and almost always gives a positive excess energy, due to ionic bonding.  The square root of this excess energy, Pauling notes, is approximately additive, and hence one can introduce the electronegativity. Thus, it is this semi-empirical formula for bond energy that underlies Pauling electronegativity concept.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe formulas are approximate, but this rough approximation is in fact relatively good and gives the right intuition, with the notion of polarity of the bond and some theoretical grounding in quantum mechanics. The electronegativities are then determined to best fit the data.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn more complex compounds, there is additional error since electronegativity depends on the molecular environment of an atom. Also, the energy estimate can be only used for single, not for multiple bonds. The energy of formation of a molecule containing only single bonds then can be approximated from an electronegativity table, and depends on the constituents and sum of squares of differences of electronegativities of all pairs of bonded atoms. Such a formula for estimating energy typically has relative error of order of 10%, but can be used to get a rough qualitative idea and understanding of a molecule.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert S. Mulliken proposed that the arithmetic mean of the first ionization energy (Ei) and the electron affinity (Eea) should be a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract electrons.[8][9] As this definition is not dependent on an arbitrary relative scale, it has also been termed absolute electronegativity,[10] with the units of kilojoules per mole or electronvolts.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it is more usual to use a linear transformation to transform these absolute values into values that resemble the more familiar Pauling values. For ionization energies and electron affinities in electronvolts,[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nand for energies in kilojoules per mole,[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mulliken electronegativity can only be calculated for an element for which the electron affinity is known, fifty-seven elements as of 2006.\\r\\nThe Mulliken electronegativity of an atom is sometimes said to be the negative of the chemical potential.  By inserting the energetic definitions of the ionization potential and electron affinity into the Mulliken electronegativity, it is possible to show that the Mulliken chemical potential is a finite difference approximation of the electronic energy with respect to the number of electrons., i.e.,\\r\\n\\r\\nA. Louis Allred and Eugene G. Rochow considered[13] that electronegativity should be related to the charge experienced by an electron on the \\"surface\\" of an atom: The higher the charge per unit area of atomic surface the greater the tendency of that atom to attract electrons. The effective nuclear charge, Zeff, experienced by valence electrons can be estimated using Slater's rules, while the surface area of an atom in a molecule can be taken to be proportional to the square of the covalent radius, rcov. When rcov is expressed in picometres,[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nR.T. Sanderson has also noted the relationship between Mulliken electronegativity and atomic size, and has proposed a method of calculation based on the reciprocal of the atomic volume.[15] With a knowledge of bond lengths, Sanderson's model allows the estimation of bond energies in a wide range of compounds.[16] Sanderson's model has also been used to calculate molecular geometry, s-electrons energy, NMR spin-spin constants and other parameters for organic compounds.[17][18] This work underlies the concept of electronegativity equalization, which suggests that electrons distribute themselves around a molecule to minimize or to equalize the Mulliken electronegativity.[19] This behavior is analogous to the equalization of chemical potential in macroscopic thermodynamics.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the simplest definition of electronegativity is that of Leland C. Allen, who has proposed that it is related to the average energy of the valence electrons in a free atom,[21]\\r\\n,[22]\\r\\n,[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere s,p are the one-electron energies of s- and p-electrons in the free atom and ns,p are the number of s- and p-electrons in the valence shell. It is usual to apply a scaling factor, 1.75G10?3 for energies expressed in kilojoules per mole or 0.169 for energies measured in electronvolts, to give values that are numerically similar to Pauling electronegativities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one-electron energies can be determined directly from spectroscopic data, and so electronegativities calculated by this method are sometimes referred to as spectroscopic electronegativities. The necessary data are available for almost all elements, and this method allows the estimation of electronegativities for elements that cannot be treated by the other methods, e.g. francium, which has an Allen electronegativity of 0.67.[24] However, it is not clear what should be considered to be valence electrons for the d- and f-block elements, which leads to an ambiguity for their electronegativities calculated by the Allen method.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this scale neon has the highest electronegativity of all elements, followed by fluorine, helium, and oxygen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wide variety of methods of calculation of electronegativities, which all give results that correlate well with one another, is one indication of the number of chemical properties which might be affected by electronegativity. The most obvious application of electronegativities is in the discussion of bond polarity, for which the concept was introduced by Pauling. In general, the greater the difference in electronegativity between two atoms the more polar the bond that will be formed between them, with the atom having the higher electronegativity being at the negative end of the dipole. Pauling proposed an equation to relate \\"ionic character\\" of a bond to the difference in electronegativity of the two atoms,[4] although this has fallen somewhat into disuse.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral correlations have been shown between infrared stretching frequencies of certain bonds and the electronegativities of the atoms involved:[25] however, this is not surprising as such stretching frequencies depend in part on bond strength, which enters into the calculation of Pauling electronegativities. More convincing are the correlations between electronegativity and chemical shifts in NMR spectroscopy[26] or isomer shifts in M?ssbauer spectroscopy[27] (see figure). Both these measurements depend on the s-electron density at the nucleus, and so are a good indication that the different measures of electronegativity really are describing \\"the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons to itself\\".[1][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements (not counting noble gases), whereas caesium is the least electronegative, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.[24] This would lead one to believe that caesium fluoride is the compound whose bonding features the most ionic character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some exceptions to this general rule. Gallium and germanium have higher electronegativities than aluminium and silicon, respectively, because of the d-block contraction. Elements of the fourth period immediately after the first row of the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the 3d-electrons are not effective at shielding the increased nuclear charge, and smaller atomic size correlates with higher electronegativity (see Allred-Rochow electronegativity, Sanderson electronegativity above). The anomalously high electronegativity of lead, in particular when compared to thallium and bismuth, appears to be an artifact of data selection (and data availability)methods of calculation other than the Pauling method show the normal periodic trends for these elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn inorganic chemistry it is common to consider a single value of the electronegativity to be valid for most \\"normal\\" situations. While this approach has the advantage of simplicity, it is clear that the electronegativity of an element is not an invariable atomic property and, in particular, increases with the oxidation state of the element.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllred used the Pauling method to calculate separate electronegativities for different oxidation states of the handful of elements (including tin and lead) for which sufficient data was available.[7] However, for most elements, there are not enough different covalent compounds for which bond dissociation energies are known to make this approach feasible. This is particularly true of the transition elements, where quoted electronegativity values are usually, of necessity, averages over several different oxidation states and where trends in electronegativity are harder to see as a result.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chemical effects of this increase in electronegativity can be seen both in the structures of oxides and halides and in the acidity of oxides and oxoacids. Hence CrO3 and Mn2O7 are acidic oxides with low melting points, while Cr2O3 is amphoteric and Mn2O3 is a completely basic oxide.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effect can also be clearly seen in the dissociation constants of the oxoacids of chlorine. The effect is much larger than could be explained by the negative charge being shared among a larger number of oxygen atoms, which would lead to a difference in pKa of log10(?1?4)?= ÿ0.6 between hypochlorous acid and perchloric acid. As the oxidation state of the central chlorine atom increases, more electron density is drawn from the oxygen atoms onto the chlorine, reducing the partial negative charge on the oxygen atoms and increasing the acidity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn organic chemistry, electronegativity is associated more with different functional groups than with individual atoms. The terms group electronegativity and substituent electronegativity are used synonymously. However, it is common to distinguish between the inductive effect and the resonance effect, which might be described as - and -electronegativities, respectively. There are a number of linear free-energy relationships that have been used to quantify these effects, of which the Hammett equation is the best known. Kabachnik parameters are group electronegativities for use in organophosphorus chemistry.\\r\\n\\r\\nElectropositivity is a measure of an element's ability to donate electrons, and therefore form positive ions; thus, it is opposed to electronegativity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMainly, this is an attribute of metals, meaning that, in general, the greater the metallic character of an element the greater the electropositivity. Therefore, the alkali metals are most electropositive of all. This is because they have a single electron in their outer shell and, as this is relatively far from the nucleus of the atom, it is easily lost; in other words, these metals have low ionization energies.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile electronegativity increases along periods in the periodic table, and decreases down groups, electropositivity decreases along periods (from left to right) and increases down groups.","input":"What is the most electronegative atom on the periodic table?"},{"output":"January 19, 2018","context":"Mania (stylized as M A ?N ??I ???A and formally titled Mania: A Fall Out Boy LP) is the upcoming seventh studio album by American rock band Fall Out Boy, set to be released on January 19, 2018, by Island Records and DCD2 as the follow-up to their 2015 album, American Beauty/American Psycho.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFall Out Boy enjoyed commercial success and worldwide acclaim after releasing their sixth studio album, American Beauty/American Psycho (2015). During the extensive touring in support of the album, the group began writing and recording material for a seventh album. The beginning of the production process for Mania began after the band's frontman Patrick Stump introduced the song \\"Young and Menace\\" to bass guitarist Pete Wentz at Reading and Leeds Festival in 2016, which inspired the musicians to record a full-length.[1] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Wentz described the vision behind Mania. \\"It feels like every once in awhile, you've gotta do a hard restart that clears the cache and erases the hard drive. I think that's what [Mania] was ÿ a big palette cleanse,\\" said Wentz.[2]\\r\\nAfter the release of the album's first two singles, \\"Young and Menace\\" and \\"Champion\\", Patrick Stump issued a statement on Twitter confirming that the band was postponing the release date for Mania until January 19, 2018 due to the album \\"feeling rushed.\\"[3]\\r\\nMania was originally scheduled for a release on September 15, 2017, worldwide.

The active agent is usually a strong alkali, although some formulations are based on ammonium thioglycolate instead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first documented history of the relaxer began with Garrett Augustus Morgan in 1909. His hair straighten cream was found accidentally when trying to find a solution to ease friction of sewing machine in his tailor shop. Morgan tested his cream on a neighboring dog's fur. With the success of the cream, he established G.A. Morgan Hair Refining Company and began selling his product to Black people.\\r\\nHair relaxing, or lanthionization, colloquially known as a perm, can be performed by a professional cosmetologist in a salon, a professional barber in a barbershop or at home with relaxer kits. As with hair dye, the treated portion of the hair moves away from the scalp as the new growth of untreated hair sprouts up from the roots, requiring periodic retreatment (about every 8ÿ10 weeks) to maintain a consistent appearance.\\r\\nThe relaxer is applied to the base of the hair shaft and remains in place for a \\"cooking\\" interval, during which it alters the hair's texture by a process of controlled damage to the protein structure. The hair can be significantly weakened by the physical overlap of excessive applications or by a single excessive one, leading to brittleness, breakage, or even widespread alopecia.\\r\\nWhen the relaxer has worked to the desired degree, the hair is rinsed clean. Regardless of formula, relaxers are always alkaline to some degree, so it is prudent to neutralize or even slightly acidify the hair with a suitable shampoo immediately afterward. The prompt use of hair conditioner is also important in order to replace some of the natural oils that were stripped away by the process.\\r\\nThio relaxers use ATG, or ammonium thioglycolate, which is also used in permanent waving, but at a much higher pH and concentration than used in permanent waves. It is usually higher than a pH of 10. These relaxers are also thicker with a higher viscosity, or thickness, which makes for an easier relaxer application. Thio relaxers break the disulfide bonds in hair, similar to the permanent waving process. When enough of the disulfide bonds in the hair are broken, the relaxer is rinsed from the hair and the hair is towel dried. After towel drying, a neutralizer of some sort is applied to the hair.\\r\\nGarrett Augustus Morgan observed that it is possible to change the basic structure of the hair shaft when certain chemicals penetrate the cortical layer. Hair relaxing products often require washing and combing with soap which had been made with excess lye. The scalp can suffer severe chemical burns if over exposed to lye or no-lye relaxers.\\r\\nA lye relaxer consists of sodium hydroxide (also known as NaOH or lye) mixed with water, petroleum jelly, mineral oil, and emulsifiers to create a creamy consistency. On application, the caustic \\"lye cream\\" permeates the protein structure of the hair and weakens its internal bonds, causing the natural curls to loosen out as the entire fiber swells open. No special deactivation step is required after washing the lye cream out, other than the routine pH adjustment and hair-conditioning.\\r\\nManufacturers vary the sodium hydroxide content of the solution from 5% to 10% and the pH between 10 and 14.\\r\\nEntirely distinct from the chemical concept of base as a wider definition for \\"alkaline\\", lye relaxers may be labelled as \\"base\\" or \\"no base\\". In this instance, the \\"base\\" refers to a preliminary coating of petroleum jelly onto the scalp to protect it from being irritated or burned by the lye cream. \\"No base\\" creams have a lower concentration of lye and may be applied directly to the hair roots without requiring the protective \\"base\\" layer, although these weaker products may still irritate the skin of some people who must therefore coat their scalps beforehand anyway.\\r\\nBecause of increasing awareness of the potential dangers of sodium hydroxide found in traditional relaxer formulas, many women have begun abandoning them.[1] \\"No-lye\\" relaxers have become increasingly popular. \\"No-lye\\" relaxers are of three main types. One type operates on the same general principle as lye relaxers but uses a slightly weaker alkaline agent, such as potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, or guanidine hydroxide. The last of these is not pre-formulated, but rather is generated at the time of use by combining a cream containing calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) with an \\"activating solution\\" of guanidine carbonate.\\r\\nAnother type of \\"no-lye\\" relaxer uses ammonium thioglycolate, which is also known as perm salt for its use in permanent waves. Perm salt is a chemical reducing agent which selectively weakens the hair's cystine bonds instead of disrupting the entire protein, but strips out the natural oils even more thoroughly than the alkali hydroxide products. Afterward, the thioglycolate must be oxidized with a special solution of hydrogen peroxide or sodium bromate.\\r\\nLastly, in most relaxers sold for home use, the active agents are ammonium sulfite and ammonium bisulfite (the two compounds are interchangeable, depending on the surrounding pH). These also selectively reduce the cystine bonds, but are much weaker and work more slowly. Nevertheless, their mild action minimizes (but does not entirely eliminate) collateral irritation to the skin.\\r\\nEarly in the 1900s hair relaxing products emerged, such as \\"G.A. brandi's hair Cream.\\" Sale of \\"lye relaxers\\" began in 1917 by companies such as Proline. They also produced the first commercial \\"no lye relaxer\\" using potassium hydroxide in 1919.\\r\\nA product falsely marketed as chemical-free in the 1990s, the Rio Hair Naturalizer System, led to a class action lawsuit against the manufacturer, the World Rio Corporation Inc., when the acidic chemicals it contained caused scalp damage and/or hair loss to thousands of users.[2][3] The product was eventually withdrawn from the market.[3]\\r\\nA Down Perm (Korean: ?? ?) is a type of hair relaxing product used in Asia with its origins in South Korea.[4] It is designed to relax Asian hair which tends to stick out, most noticeably after washing it.[5]\\r\\nThe hair of some Africans is elliptical in shape and therefore very tightly curled (Asian hair tends to be round and Caucasian hair is in-between). The relaxer cream breaks down the chemical bonds of the hair shaft, disrupting the elliptical shape and reconstructing the bonds in a different way. Though hair follicles themselves are not damaged, the hair can become very brittle and break off. There is also risks of scalp burns if the relaxer comes into contact with the skin. Some professionals apply a scalp base cream or protector prior to application to protect the client's scalp from chemical burns. Cosmetic products are not subject to pre-market approval by the Food and Drug Administration and a complete list of ingredients is not mandatory, however many brands of hair relaxers list phthalate directly as one of their chemical ingredients. Phthalates from cosmetic products can be inhaled or absorbed by the skin and these have been shown to have estrogenic effects in cell models and experimental animals.\\r\\nA correlation study published in 2012 showed a link between the use of relaxers by African-American women with an increased risk of uterine leiomyomata. The incidence of this disease is 2 to 3 times higher in African-Americans compared to Caucasian women.[6] However, the paper makes no causal connections between relaxers and uterine fibroids, even though some media outlets have reported otherwise.[7]","input":"Who invented the first perm for black hair?"},{"output":"only one opening for both ingestion (intake of nutrients) and egestion (removal of undigested wastes)","context":"Traditional:\\r\\nPhylogenetic:\\r\\nThe flatworms, flat worms, Platyhelminthes, Plathelminthes, or platyhelminths (from the Greek ϫ?, platy, meaning \\"flat\\" and ?? (root: ?Ĳ-), helminth-, meaning \\"worm\\")[2] are a phylum of relatively simple bilaterian, unsegmented, soft-bodied invertebrates. Unlike other bilaterians, they are acoelomates (having no body cavity), and have no specialized circulatory and respiratory organs, which restricts them to having flattened shapes that allow oxygen and nutrients to pass through their bodies by diffusion. The digestive cavity has only one opening for both ingestion (intake of nutrients) and egestion (removal of undigested wastes); as a result, the food cannot be processed continuously.\\r\\nIn traditional medicinal texts, Platyhelminthes are divided into Turbellaria, which are mostly non-parasitic animals such as planarians, and three entirely parasitic groups: Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea; however, since the turbellarians have since been proven not to be monophyletic, this classification is now deprecated. Free-living flatworms are mostly predators, and live in water or in shaded, humid terrestrial environments, such as leaf litter. Cestodes (tapeworms) and trematodes (flukes) have complex life-cycles, with mature stages that live as parasites in the digestive systems of fish or land vertebrates, and intermediate stages that infest secondary hosts. The eggs of trematodes are excreted from their main hosts, whereas adult cestodes generate vast numbers of hermaphroditic, segment-like proglottids that detach when mature, are excreted, and then release eggs. Unlike the other parasitic groups, the monogeneans are external parasites infesting aquatic animals, and their larvae metamorphose into the adult form after attaching to a suitable host.\\r\\nBecause they do not have internal body cavities, Platyhelminthes were regarded as a primitive stage in the evolution of bilaterians (animals with bilateral symmetry and hence with distinct front and rear ends). However, analyses since the mid-1980s have separated out one subgroup, the Acoelomorpha, as basal bilaterianscloser to the original bilaterians than to any other modern groups. The remaining Platyhelminthes form a monophyletic group, one that contains all and only descendants of a common ancestor that is itself a member of the group. The redefined Platyhelminthes is part of the Lophotrochozoa, one of the three main groups of more complex bilaterians. These analyses had concluded the redefined Platyhelminthes, excluding Acoelomorpha, consists of two monophyletic subgroups, Catenulida and Rhabditophora, with Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea forming a monophyletic subgroup within one branch of the Rhabditophora. Hence, the traditional platyhelminth subgroup \\"Turbellaria\\" is now regarded as paraphyletic, since it excludes the wholly parasitic groups, although these are descended from one group of \\"turbellarians\\".\\r\\nTwo planarian species have been used successfully in the Philippines, Indonesia, Hawaii, New Guinea, and Guam to control populations of the imported giant African snail Achatina fulica, which was displacing native snails. However, there is now concern that these planarians may themselves become a serious threat to native snails. In northwest Europe, there are concerns about the spread of the New Zealand planarian Arthurdendyus triangulatus, which preys on earthworms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPlatyhelminthes are bilaterally symmetrical animals: their left and right sides are mirror images of each other; this also implies they have distinct top and bottom surfaces and distinct head and tail ends. Like other bilaterians, they have three main cell layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm),[3] while the radially symmetrical cnidarians and ctenophores (comb jellies) have only two cell layers.[4] Beyond that, they are \\"defined more by what they do not have than by any particular series of specializations.\\"[5] Unlike other bilaterians, Platyhelminthes have no internal body cavity, so are described as acoelomates. They also lack specialized circulatory and respiratory organs, both of these facts are defining features when classifying a flatworm's anatomy.[3][6] Their bodies are soft and unsegmented.[7]\\r\\nThe lack of circulatory and respiratory organs limits platyhelminths to sizes and shapes that enable oxygen to reach and carbon dioxide to leave all parts of their bodies by simple diffusion. Hence, many are microscopic and the large species have flat ribbon-like or leaf-like shapes. The guts of large species have many branches, allowing nutrients to diffuse to all parts of the body.[5] Respiration through the whole surface of the body makes them vulnerable to fluid loss, and restricts them to environments where dehydration is unlikely: sea and freshwater, moist terrestrial environments such as leaf litter or between grains of soil, and as parasites within other animals.[3]\\r\\nThe space between the skin and gut is filled with mesenchyme, a connective tissue made of cells and reinforced by collagen fibers that act as a type of skeleton, providing attachment points for muscles. The mesenchyme contains all the internal organs and allows the passage of oxygen, nutrients and waste products. It consists of two main types of cell: fixed cells, some of which have fluid-filled vacuoles; and stem cells, which can transform into any other type of cell, and are used in regenerating tissues after injury or asexual reproduction.[3]\\r\\nMost platyhelminths have no anus and regurgitate undigested material through the mouth. However, some long species have an anus and some with complex, branched guts have more than one anus, since excretion only through the mouth would be difficult for them.[6] The gut is lined with a single layer of endodermal cells that absorb and digest food. Some species break up and soften food first by secreting enzymes in the gut or pharynx (throat).[3]\\r\\nAll animals need to keep the concentration of dissolved substances in their body fluids at a fairly constant level. Internal parasites and free-living marine animals live in environments with high concentrations of dissolved material, and generally let their tissues have the same level of concentration as the environment, while freshwater animals need to prevent their body fluids from becoming too dilute. Despite this difference in environments, most platyhelminths use the same system to control the concentration of their body fluids. Flame cells, so called because the beating of their flagella looks like a flickering candle flame, extract from the mesenchyme water that contains wastes and some reusable material, and drive it into networks of tube cells which are lined with flagella and microvilli. The tube cells' flagella drive the water towards exits called nephridiopores, while their microvilli reabsorb reusable materials and as much water as is needed to keep the body fluids at the right concentration. These combinations of flame cells and tube cells are called protonephridia.[3][8]\\r\\nIn all platyhelminths, the nervous system is concentrated at the head end. This is least marked in the acoels, which have nerve nets rather like those of cnidarians and ctenophores, but densest around the head. Other platyhelminths have rings of ganglia in the head and main nerve trunks running along their bodies.[3][6]\\r\\nEarly classification divided the flatworms in four groups: Turbellaria, Trematoda, Monogenea and Cestoda. This classification had long been recognized to be artificial, and in 1985, Ehlers[9] proposed a phylogenetically more correct classification, where the massively polyphyletic \\"Turbellaria\\" was split into a dozen orders, and Trematoda, Monogenea and Cestoda were joined in the new order Neodermata. However, the classification presented here is the early, traditional, classification, as it still is the one used everywhere except in scientific articles.[3]\\r\\nThese have about 4,500 species,[6] are mostly free-living, and range from 1?mm (0.039?in) to 600?mm (24?in) in length. Most are predators or scavengers, and terrestrial species are mostly nocturnal and live in shaded, humid locations, such as leaf litter or rotting wood. However, some are symbiotes of other animals, such as crustaceans, and some are parasites. Free-living turbellarians are mostly black, brown or gray, but some larger ones are brightly colored.[3] The Acoela and Nemertodermatida were traditionally regarded as turbellarians,[6][10] but are now regarded as members of a separate phylum, the Acoelomorpha,[11][12] or as two separate phyla.[13] Xenoturbella, a genus of very simple animals,[14] has also been reclassified as a separate phylum.[15]\\r\\nSome turbellarians have a simple pharynx lined with cilia and generally feed by using cilia to sweep food particles and small prey into their mouths, which are usually in the middle of their undersides. Most other turbellarians have a pharynx that is eversible (can be extended by being turned inside-out), and the mouths of different species can be anywhere along the underside.[3] The freshwater species Microstomum caudatum can open its mouth almost as wide as its body is long, to swallow prey about as large as itself.[6]\\r\\nMost turbellarians have pigment-cup ocelli (\\"little eyes\\"), one pair in most species, but two or even three pairs in some. A few large species have many eyes in clusters over the brain, mounted on tentacles, or spaced uniformly around the edge of the body. The ocelli can only distinguish the direction from which light is coming and enable the animals to avoid it. A few groups have statocysts, fluid-filled chambers containing a small, solid particle or, in a few groups, two. These statocysts are thought to be balance and acceleration sensors, as that is the function they perform in cnidarian medusae and in ctenophores. However, turbellarian statocysts have no sensory cilia, and how they sense the movements and positions of the solid particles is unknown. On the other hand, most have ciliated touch-sensor cells scattered over their bodies, especially on tentacles and around the edges. Specialized cells in pits or grooves on the head are probably smell sensors.[6]\\r\\nPlanarians, a subgroup of seriates, are famous for their ability to regenerate if divided by cuts across their bodies. Experiments show that, in fragments that do not already have a head, a new head grows most quickly on those closest to the original head. This suggests the growth of a head is controlled by a chemical whose concentration diminishes from head to tail. Many turbellarians clone themselves by transverse or longitudinal division, and others, especially acoels, reproduce by budding.[6]\\r\\nThe vast majority of turbellarians are hermaphrodites (have both female and male reproductive cells), and fertilize eggs internally by copulation.[6] Some of the larger aquatic species mate by penis fencing, a duel in which each tries to impregnate the other, and the loser adopts the female role of developing the eggs.[16] In most species, \\"miniature adults\\" emerge when the eggs hatch, but a few large species produce plankton-like larvae.[6]\\r\\nThese parasites' name refers to the cavities in their holdfasts (Greek ?ϫ, hole),[3] which resemble suckers and anchor them within their hosts.[7] The skin of all species is a syncitium, a layer of cells that shares a single external membrane. Trematodes are divided into two groups, Digenea and Aspidogastrea (also known as Aspodibothrea).[6]\\r\\nThese are often called flukes, as most have flat rhomboid shapes like that of a flounder (Old English fl܇c). There are about 11,000 species, more than all other platyhelminthes combined, and second only to roundworms among parasites on metazoans.[6] Adults usually have two holdfasts, a ring around the mouth and a larger sucker midway along what would be the underside in a free-living flatworm.[3] Although the name \\"Digeneans\\" means \\"two generations\\", most have very complex life cycles with up to seven stages, depending on what combinations of environments the early stages encounter ÿ most importantly whether the eggs are deposited on land or in water. The intermediate stages transfer the parasites from one host to another. The definitive host in which adults develop is a land vertebrate, the earliest host of juvenile stages is usually a snail that may live on land or in water, and in many cases a fish or arthropod is the second host.[6] For example, the adjoining illustration shows the life cycle of the intestinal fluke metagonimus, which hatches in the intestine of a snail; moves to a fish, where it penetrates the body and encysts in the flesh; then moves to the small intestine of a land animal that eats the fish raw; and then generates eggs that are excreted and ingested by snails, thereby completing the cycle. Schistosomes, which cause the devastating tropical disease bilharzia, belong to this group.[17]\\r\\nAdults range between 0.2?mm (0.0079?in) and 6?mm (0.24?in) in length. Individual adult digeneans are of a single sex, and in some species, slender females live in enclosed grooves that run along the bodies of the males, and partially emerge to lay eggs. In all species, the adults have complex reproductive systems and can produce between 10,000 and 100,000 times as many eggs as a free-living flatworm. In addition, the intermediate stages that live in snails reproduce asexually.[6]\\r\\nAdults of different species infest different parts of the definitive host, for example the intestine, lungs, large blood vessels,[3] and liver.[6] The adults use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids or blood. In both the adults and the stages that live in snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.[6]\\r\\nMembers of this small group have either a single divided sucker or a row of suckers that cover the underside.[6] They infest the guts of bony or cartilaginous fish and of turtles, and the body cavities of marine and freshwater bivalves and gastropods.[3] Their eggs produce ciliated swimming larvae, and the life cycle has one or two hosts.[6]\\r\\nThese parasites attach themselves to their hosts by means of disks that bear crescent-shaped hooks. They are divided into Monogenea and Cestoda.[6]\\r\\nOf about 1,100 species of monogeneans, most are external parasites that require particular host species, mainly fish, but in some cases amphibians or aquatic reptiles. However, a few are internal parasites. Adult monogeneans have large attachment organs at the rear, haptors (Greek ?, haptein, means \\"catch\\"), which have suckers, clamps, and hooks. They often have flattened bodies. In some species, the pharynx secretes enzymes to digest the host's skin, allowing the parasite to feed on blood and cellular debris. Others graze externally on mucus and flakes of the hosts' skins. The name \\"Monogenea\\" is based on the fact that these parasites have only one nonlarval generation.[6]\\r\\nThese are often called tapeworms because of their flat, slender but very long bodies ÿ the name \\"cestode\\" is derived from the Latin word cestus, which means \\"tape\\". The adults of all 3,400 cestode species are internal parasites. Cestodes have no mouths or guts, and the syncitial skin absorbs nutrients ÿ mainly carbohydrates and amino acids ÿ from the host, and also disguises it chemically to avoid attacks by the host's immune system.[6] Shortage of carbohydrates in the host's diet stunts the growth of the parasites and kills some. Their metabolisms generally use simple but inefficient chemical processes, and they compensate by consuming large amounts of food relative to their size.[3]\\r\\nIn the majority of species, known as eucestodes (\\"true tapeworms\\"), the neck produces a chain of segments called proglottids by a process known as strobilation. Hence, the most mature proglottids are furthest from the scolex. Adults of Taenia saginata, which infests humans, can form proglottid chains over 20 metres (66?ft) long, although 4 metres (13?ft) is more typical. Each proglottid has both male and female reproductive organs. If the host's gut contains two or more adults of the same cestode species, they generally fertilize each other, but proglottids of the same worm can fertilize each other and even fertilize themselves. When the eggs are fully developed, the proglottids separate and are excreted by the host. The eucestode life cycle is less complex than that of digeneans, but varies depending on the species. For example:\\r\\nA members of the smaller group known as Cestodaria have no scolex, do not produce proglottids, and have body shapes like those of diageneans. Cestodarians parasitize fish and turtles.[3]\\r\\nAcoelomorpha (Acoela and Nemertodermatida)\\r\\nDeuterostomia (Echinoderms, chordates, etc.)\\r\\nEcdysozoa\\r\\n(Arthropods, nematodes, priapulids, etc.)\\r\\nBryozoa\\r\\nAnnelida\\r\\nSipuncula\\r\\nMollusca\\r\\nPhoronida and Brachiopoda\\r\\nNemertea\\r\\nDicyemida\\r\\nMyzostomida\\r\\nOther Platyzoa\\r\\nGastrotricha\\r\\nPlatyhelminthes\\r\\nCatenulida\\r\\nMacrostomorpha\\r\\nLecithoepitheliata\\r\\nPolycladida\\r\\nRhabdocoela\\r\\nProseriata\\r\\nProlecithophora\\r\\nFecampiida\\r\\nTricladida\\r\\n(planarians)\\r\\nBothrioplanida\\r\\nNeodermata\\r\\n(all parasitic: flukes, tapeworms, etc.)\\r\\nThe oldest confidently identified parasitic flatworm fossils are cestode eggs found in a Permian shark coprolite, but helminth hooks still attached to Devonian acanthodians and placoderms might also represent parasitic flatworms with simple life cycles.[22] The oldest known free-living platyhelminth specimen is a fossil preserved in Eocene age Baltic amber and placed in the monotypic species Micropalaeosoma balticus,[23] while the oldest subfossil specimens are schistosome eggs discovered in ancient Egyptian mummies.[7] The Platyhelminthes have very few synapomorphies, distinguishing features that all Platyhelminthes and no other animals have. This makes it difficult to work out both their relationships with other groups of animals and the relationships between different groups that are described as members of the Platyhelminthes.[24]\\r\\nThe \\"traditional\\" view before the 1990s was that Platyhelminthes formed the sister group to all the other bilaterians, which include, for example, arthropods, molluscs, annelids and chordates. Since then molecular phylogenetics, which aims to work out evolutionary \\"family trees\\" by comparing different organisms' biochemicals such as DNA, RNA and proteins, has radically changed scientists' view of evolutionary relationships between animals.[11] Detailed morphological analyses of anatomical features in the mid-1980s and molecular phylogenetics analyses since 2000 using different sections of DNA agree that Acoelomorpha, consisting of Acoela (traditionally regarded as very simple \\"turbellarians\\"[6]) and Nemertodermatida (another small group previously classified as \\"turbellarians\\"[10]) are the sister group to all other bilaterians, including the rest of the Platyhelminthes.[11][12] However, a 2007 study concluded that Acoela and Nemertodermatida were two distinct groups of bilaterians, although it agreed that both are more closely related to cnidarians (jellyfish, etc.) than other bilaterians are.[13]\\r\\nXenoturbella, a bilaterian whose only well-defined organ is a statocyst, was originally classified as a \\"primitive turbellarian\\".[14] However, it has recently been reclassified as a deuterostome.[15][25]\\r\\nThe Platyhelminthes excluding Acoelomorpha contain two main groups, Catenulida and Rhabditophora, both of which are generally agreed to be monophyletic (each contains all and only the descendants of an ancestor that is a member of the same group).[12][19] Early molecular phylogenetics analyses of the Catenulida and Rhabditophora left uncertainties about whether these could be combined in a single monophyletic group, but a study in 2008 concluded they could, therefore Platyhelminthes could be redefined as Catenulida plus Rhabditophora, excluding the Acoelomorpha.[12]\\r\\nOther molecular phylogenetics analyses agree the redefined Platyhelminthes are most closely related to Gastrotricha, and both are part of a grouping known as Platyzoa. Platyzoa are generally agreed to be at least closely related to the Lophotrochozoa, a superphylum that includes molluscs and annelid worms. The majority view is that Platyzoa are part of Lophotrochozoa, but a significant minority of researchers regard Platyzoa as a sister group of Lophotrochozoa.[11]\\r\\nIt has been agreed since 1985 that each of the wholly parasitic platyhelminth groups (Cestoda, Monogenea and Trematoda) is monophyletic, and that together these form a larger monophyletic grouping, the Neodermata, in which the adults of all members have syncitial skins.[26] However, there is debate about whether the Cestoda and Monogenea can be combined as an intermediate monophyletic group, the Cercomeromorpha, within the Neodermata.[26][27] It is generally agreed that the Neodermata are a sub-group a few levels down in the \\"family tree\\" of the Rhabditophora.[12] Hence the traditional sub-phylum \\"Turbellaria\\" is paraphyletic, since it does not include the Neodermata although these are descendants of a sub-group of \\"turbellarians\\".[28]\\r\\nAn outline of the origins of the parasitic life style has been proposed.[29] Epithelial feeding monopisthocotyleans on fish hosts are basal in the Neodermata and were the first shift to parasitism from free living ancestors. The next evolutionary step was a dietary change from epithelium to blood. The last common ancestor of Digenea + Cestoda was monogenean and most likely sanguinivorous.\\r\\nThe earliest known fossils of tapeworms have been dated to 270?million years ago. They were found in coprolites (fossilised faeces) from an elasmobranch.[1]\\r\\nCestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes) cause diseases in humans and their livestock, and monogeneans can cause serious losses of stocks in fish farms.[30] Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200?million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but often is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, and increase the risk of bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through human skin. The people most at risk are those who use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.[17]\\r\\nIn 2000, an estimated 45?million people were infected with the beef tapeworm Taenia saginata and 3?million with the pork tapeworm Taenia solium.[30] Infection of the digestive system by adult tapeworms causes abdominal symptoms that are unpleasant but not disabling or life-threatening.[31][32] However, neurocysticercosis resulting from penetration of T. solium larvae into the central nervous system is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide.[33] In 2000, about 39 million people were infected with trematodes (flukes) that naturally parasitize fish and crustaceans, but can pass to humans who eat raw or lightly cooked seafood. Infection of humans by the broad fish tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum occasionally causes vitamin B12 deficiency and, in severe cases, megaloblastic anemia.[30]\\r\\nThe threat to humans in developed countries is rising as a result of social trends: the increase in organic farming, which uses manure and sewage sludge rather than artificial fertilizers, and spreads parasites both directly and via the droppings of seagulls which feed on manure and sludge; the increasing popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods; imports of meat, seafood and salad vegetables from high-risk areas; and, as an underlying cause, reduced awareness of parasites compared with other public health issues such as pollution. In less-developed countries, inadequate sanitation and the use of human feces (night soil) as fertilizer and to enrich fish farm ponds continues to spread parasitic platyhelminths, and poorly designed water-supply and irrigation projects have provided additional channels for their spread. People in these countries often cannot afford the cost of fuel required to cook food thoroughly enough to kill parasites. Controlling parasites that infect humans and livestock has become more difficult, as many species have become resistant to drugs that used to be effective, mainly for killing juveniles in meat.[30] While poorer countries still struggle with unintentional infection, cases have been reported of intentional infection in the US by dieters desperate for rapid weight-loss.[34]\\r\\nThere is concern about the proliferation in northwest Europe, including the British Isles, of the New Zealand planarian Arthurdendyus triangulatus and the Australian flatworm Australoplana sanguinea, both of which prey on earthworms.[35] A. triangulatus is thought to have reached Europe in containers of plants imported by botanical gardens.[36]\\r\\nIn Hawaii, the planarian Endeavouria septemlineata has been used to control the imported giant African snail Achatina fulica, which was displacing native snails, and Platydemus manokwari, another planarian, has been used for the same purpose in Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea and Guam. Although A. fulica has declined sharply in Hawaii, there are doubts about how much E. septemlineata contributed to this. However, P. manokwari is given credit for severely reducing, and in places exterminating, A. fulica ÿ achieving much greater success than most biological pest control programs, which generally aim for a low, stable population of the pest species. The ability of planarians to take different kinds of prey and to resist starvation may account for their ability to decimate A. fulica. However, these abilities have raised concerns that planarians may themselves become a serious threat to native snails.[37] [38]\\r\\nA study[39] in La Plata, Argentina shows the potential for planarians such as Girardia anceps, Mesostoma ehrenbergii, and Bothromesostoma evelinae to reduce populations of the mosquito species Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens. The experiment showed that G. anceps in particular can prey on all instars of both mosquito species and maintain a steady predation rate over time. The ability for these flatworms to live in artificial containers showed the potential of placing these species in popular mosquito breeding sites, which would ideally reduce the amount of mosquito-borne diseases.","input":"What is unique about the digestive system in platyhelminthes?"},{"output":"21 February 1957","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cavern Club at 10 Mathew Street, in Liverpool was the venue where the Beatles' (formerly known as the Quarrymen) UK popularity started. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Pete Best were first seen by Brian Epstein at the club. Epstein eventually became their manager, going on to secure them a record contract. Best was replaced by Ringo Starr on 16 August 1962, which upset many Beatles fans. After taunts of, \\"Pete forever, Ringo never!\\", one agitated fan headbutted Harrison in the club.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cavern Club was the third club managed by Alan Synter, which originally opened as a jazz-only club on 16 January 1957, being styled after the Paris venue, Le Caveau. The Quarrymen made their first appearance at the club on 21 February 1957,[citation needed] but by 9 February 1961,[1] when the group first performed there under their new name of the Beatles, the club was under the ownership of Ray McFall. The Cavern Club's popularity grew, rapidly becoming the most famous club in Britain[citation needed]. According to the club's resident DJ, Bob Wooler, the Beatles made 292 appearances at the club in 1961,?1962?and?1963,[2] culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963one month after the group recorded \\"She Loves You\\", and six months before their first trip to the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club changed hands several more times before eventually being demolished to allow construction of an underground railway ventilation duct, before being used as a car park. A replica of the club was built on \\"75 per cent of the original site\\" in 1984,[3] built with 15,000 bricks retrieved from the original club site. On 16 January 1997, a sculpture of Lennon was unveiled outside The New Cavern Club, and on 14 December 1999, McCartney performed there, playing his last concert of the 20th century and publicising his album, Run Devil Run.\\r\\n\\r\\nOwned by Synter, the club originally opened on 16 January 1957 as a jazz-only club, which was one of three jazz clubs he managed.[4] He styled the club after the Paris venue, Le Caveau, as the French club was also a cellar.[5][6] The Cavern was an arched cellar built of bricks, under a seven-storey fruit warehouse. It had previously been used as a wine cellar, and as an air raid shelter during World War II.[3] Because of its position underground, it was well known as being damp, and very hot when the club was full.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early August 1957, whilst playing golf at the Childwall Golf Club, with Synter's father, Dr. Joseph Sytner, Nigel Walleya friend of Lennons who was an apprentice golf professional at the Lee Park Golf Clubasked Dr. Sytner if his son would book the Quarrymen at The Cavern Club in Mathew Street, Liverpool.[8]  Dr. Sytner suggested that the group should play at the golf club first, so as to assess their talent.[9] The group set up in the downstairs lounge of the golf club, and were surprised when nearly one hundred people filed in to listen.[10] The performance was a success, and a hat was later passed around that collected almost S15; significantly more than other groups were paid at the time.[11] Alan Sytner phoned Walley a week later and offered the group an interlude spot on 7 August, playing skiffle between the performances of three skiffle bands at the club:[12] Ron McKay's Skiffle Group, Dark Town Skiffle Group, and The Deltones Skiffle Group.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore their first Cavern Club performance, the group argued amongst themselves about the set list, as rock 'n roll songs were not allowed at the club, but skiffle was tolerated. After starting with a skiffle song, Lennon told the others to start playing \\"Don't Be Cruel\\", by Elvis Presley. Banjo-player Rod Davis warned Lennon that the audience would \\"eat you alive\\", which Lennon ignored, starting the song by himself, which forced the others to join in. Halfway through, Sytner pushed his way through the audience and handed Lennon a note which read, \\"Cut out the bloody rock 'n roll\\".[14] In 1959, Sytner sold the club to an accountant, McFall, for S2,750.[15] In 1960, the Quarrymen changed their name, initially to the Silver Beetles, and finally to the Beatles, before their initial residency in Hamburg.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beatles' history with the Cavern Club is also explored in two recent documentary films: I Was There: When the Beatles Played the Cavern (2011),[17] directed by John Piper; and Good Ol' Freda (2013), directed by Ryan White. (See note below in \\"Epstein\\".)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beatles' name was first noticed by Epstein in the first issue of Bill Harry's Mersey Beat magazine (which Epstein successfully sold in his NEMS music store), on numerous posters around Liverpool, and on the front page of the second issue of Mersey Beat.[18] before asking journalist Harry who they were.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beatlesthen consisting of Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Bestwere due to perform a lunchtime concert in The Cavern Club on 9 November 1961,[20] as part of a residency, for S3, 15 shillings a concert.[6][21] According to Sytner, Epstein had visited the club quite a few times previously on Saturday nights, once asking Sytner to book a group for his twenty-first birthday party.[22] Epstein asked Harry to arrange for Epstein and his assistant, Alistair Taylor, to watch the Beatles perform, so Epstein and Taylor were allowed into the club without queuing, with a welcome message being announced over the club's public-address system by Wooler, the resident DJ.[23] Epstein later talked about the performance: \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the performance, Epstein and Taylor went into the dressing room, which he later called \\"as big as a broom cupboard\\", to talk to them.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beatles, who were all regular NEMS customers, immediately recognised Epstein, but before Epstein could congratulate them on their performance, Harrison said, \\"And what brings Mr. Epstein here?\\"[26] Epstein replied with, \\"We just popped in to say hello. I enjoyed your performance\\". He introduced Taylor, who merely nodded a greeting, and then said, \\"Well done, then, Goodbye,\\" and left.[27] Epstein and Taylor went to Peacock's restaurant in Hackins Hey for lunch, and during the meal Epstein asked Taylor what he thought about the group. Taylor replied that he honestly thought they were \\"absolutely awful\\", but there was something \\"remarkable\\" about them. Epstein waited a long time before saying anything further, eventually saying, \\"I think they're tremendous!\\" Later, when Epstein was paying the bill, he grabbed Taylor's arm and said, \\"Do you think I should manage them?\\"[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beatles were scheduled to play at the club over the next three weeks, and Epstein was always there to watch them. Epstein contacted Allan Williams (their previous promoter/manager), to confirm that Williams no longer had any ties to them, but Williams advised Epstein \\"not to touch them with a barge pole [to stay away]\\", because of a concert percentage the group had refused to pay him while playing in Hamburg.[29][30] Epstein later signed singer Cilla Black, who had been working as a hat-check girl in the club.[31] The Beatles were recorded playing live at the club on 22 August 1962, by Granada Television,[32] and their producer at EMI, George Martin, later thought of recording them live there, calling the projected album Off The Beatle Track, but soon realised the club had terrible acoustics.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nEpstein also hired Beatles secretary Freda Kelly, whose memories of him, the Cavern and the Beatles over the group's duration are detailed in the documentaries noted above[34] and in the 2013 documentary Good Ol' Freda.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Epstein had had no prior experience of artist management, he made it clear that he wanted to change the Beatles early dress-code and attitude on stage, as they wore blue jeans and leather jackets, smoked, ate and swore, stopped and started songs when they felt like it, pretended to hit each other, and turned their backs to the audience.[35] Epstein put a stop to their behaviour, insisting they wear more suitable clothes, and later suggested the famous synchronised bow at the end of their performances.[36][37] Epstein: \\"I encouraged them, at first, to get out of the leather jackets and jeans, and I wouldn't allow them to appear in jeans after a short time, and then, after that step, I got them to wear sweaters on stage, and then, very reluctantly, eventually, suits\\".[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCartney was the first to agree with Epstein's ideas, believing it was due to Epstein's RADA training.[37][39] Lennon was against the idea of suits and ties, but later said, \\"Yeah, man, all right, I'll wear a suit. I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me\\".[40] According to McCartney, \\"The gigs went up in stature and though the pay went up only a little bit, it did go up\\", and that the group was \\"now playing better places\\".[41] Epstein pushed McFall to raise the group's fee for a concert at the club from the previous S3, 15 shillings, to S10.[42] Another improvement was that the group was now far more organised; having a single concert diary in which to record bookings, rather than using whoever's diary was to hand.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring their \\"Welcome Home\\" session at The Cavern in June 1962, The Beatles gave what Wooler described as \\"one of their finest ever performances\\", drawing \\"a feverish reaction\\" that was equal, Wooler said, to the \\"Beatlemania\\" that broke out nationwide a few months later.[43] The Cavern Club's popularity grew; rapidly becoming the most famous club in Britain.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beatles' press officer, Tony Barrow, wrote a book called On the Scene at the Cavern, using the pseudonym Alistair Griffin.  \\"On the Scene at the Cavern,\\" a book including text as well as photographs from the crowds and performances at the club, was celebrated at a launch party at The Cavern Club in August 1964.  In the book, Barrow described in vivid detail the scene at the Cavern Club in its heyday.  \\"Even on a night when the Beatles werent billed to appear there were odds-on chances youd find Paul or George or one of the other boys propping up the counter of The Caverns coke bar and chatting to groups of fans,\\" Barrow tells readers of \\"On the Scene at the Cavern\\". \\"And if you looked in at a lunchtime session Cillia Black would have checked your coat into the cloakroom or spooned out a plate of tomato soup for you.\\"  On the Scene at the Cavern\\" was published by Panther Books, and it was reissued in 1984 with additional pictures and text from the days of the Cavern Club.  Barrow also wrote for The Beatles Monthly Book at this time using the pseudonym Frederick James.  And a \\"Cavern trip to Hamburg\\" was organised, involving a visit to The Star-Club where the Beatles had been a resident group.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational attention became regular at The Cavern Club, with television cameras, radio broadcasters and press representatives from all over Europe visiting the club, along with reporters from the US magazines, Time, Life and Newsweek.[43] It was also visited by numerous international celebrities, including Chet Atkins, Anna Neagle and Arthur Fiedler.[43] When The Cavern grew to incorporate adjacent premises and a recording studio and new stage were built, there was such a great international demand for what the club sold as \\"Beatleboard\\" (pieces of wood from the old stage where the Beatles had played so many times), that it took four months to process the orders.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to DJ Wooler,[2] over the course of a two-and-a-half-year period which began when they first played at the venue in February 1961, the Beatles made a total of 292 appearances at the club,[3] although author Barry Miles, in his book The Beatles Diary Volume 1: The Beatles Years states that it was 275 times.[13] Their final performance at the club was on 3 August 1963.[44] During their time at the club, the Beatles also had residencies in Hamburg.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 August 1963, a month after recording \\"She Loves You\\", the Beatles performed at the club for the last time.[44] McFall ran the club until 1965, before closing it due to bankruptcy.[3] The fans of the club were incensed at the closure, and barricaded themselves inside.[49] The club changed hands several more times before eventually being demolished in 1973 to allow construction of an underground railway ventilation duct, before being used as a car park.[3] A replica of the club was built on \\"75 percent of the original site\\" in 1984,[3] and supposedly built with 15,000 bricks retrieved from the original club site.[5][50]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 16 January 1997, a sculpture of Lennon was unveiled outside The New Cavern Club.

It launched on November 13, 2008 and sold 2.8 million copies within the first day, making it the fastest selling computer game of all time released at that point. The game added a substantial amount of new content into the game world, including the new continent of Northrend, home of the eponymous Lich King and his undead minions. In order to advance through Northrend, players are required to reach at least level 68 and the level cap for the expansion is 80. The first hero class was introduced, the Death Knight, that starts at level 55.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first expansion pack, World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade, raised the maximum level from 60 to 70 and the Wrath of the Lich King raised the level cap from 70 to 80.[4]\\r\\nThe death knight is the first \\"hero class\\" introduced in World of Warcraft, and would be the only one available until the introduction of the demon hunter in Legion. Hero classes are those that start the game at a higher level than the regular level 1. Originally, a death knight could only be created if the player previously had a level 55 on that realm but that requirement was removed in late 2014.[5]\\r\\nDeath knights are fallen heroes of the Alliance and the Horde, raised by the Lich King to serve as champions of the undead Scourge. They are able to fill the tank and damage dealer roles. The three death knight specializations are blood, frost and unholy. The blood specialization focuses on the manipulation of blood, using an enemy's blood against them while using the death knights' blood to benefit themselves. Frost specializes in control, counters and combination strikes using frost related abilities. Unholy specialization focuses on poisoning your opponent and sending the player's permanent, controllable pet ghoul to attack the enemy.[6][7] Death knights wear plate armor and wield weapons with rune engravings (permanent weapon enhancements), which are achieved through the death knight profession called runeforging by utilizing the runeforge in Acherus.\\r\\nNewly created death knights begin with a larger set of spells and abilities than new characters of other classes. The class starts without any talent points and must unlock available talent tiers for their level by completing quests in the death knight starting area in Eastern Plaguelands.[8] Players must complete all the starting area quests in order to join the rest of Azeroth. The death knight class is available to all in-game races except the Pandarens.\\r\\nInstead of utilizing rage, energy or mana for combat resources, a death knight uses a system of runes and runic power (both displayed under the player portrait), which is generated by using runes.[9] The death knight originally had two of each type of rune - blood, frost and unholy - available for use. After a rune is used, it enters a ten-second 'cooldown' period before it can be used again and runic power decays over time when out of combat. With specific talents, the death knight can also turn their runes into death runes, which can be used as any type of rune. The death knight has the option of three presences: blood, frost and unholy. In Wrath of the Lich King, frost presence increased threat generated, increased health and lowered damage taken; blood presence increased damage done and restored a portion of damage dealt as healing; unholy presence increased attack speed, increased movement speed and reduced the global cooldown on all abilities.[7]\\r\\nIn the following expansion, Cataclysm, with a desire to clearly designate specializations as damage dealing or tank, Blood became the designated tanking spec and blood presence's effects was changed so that blood presence had threat and damage mitigation and frost presence was changed to increasing all runic power generation. In the Legion expansion, death knights have six death runes instead of three types of runes and presences were removed; each specific presence's effect is included in its related specialization automatically.[10]\\r\\nNorthrend is a crescent-shaped continent in northern Azeroth.[11] The continent is roughly half the size of the Eastern Kingdoms, but matches Outland in length and width. Although Northrend is known for its snow and ice, only parts of the continent are frozen over.[12] Northrend features eight zones with content designed for players beginning at level 68, although players may travel to Northrend at any level.[13] Players arrive by boat (Alliance) or zeppelin (Horde) either at the Howling Fjord or the Borean Tundra zones, each located at opposite ends of the continent. Howling Fjord is home to evil half-giants called the Vrykul, who reside in Utgarde Keep, the first dungeon in the expansion. The Dragonblight and Grizzly Hills zones are located in the southcentral and southeast parts of the continent respectively. The Ursine Furbolgs reside in the forested Grizzly Hills. Dragonblight features the gravesites of dragons who came to the region to die.[14] Wintergrasp is the first zone in World of Warcraft designed specifically for Player versus Player (PVP) activities, even on Player versus Environment (PvE) servers.[15]\\r\\nThe forces of the Alliance, unified under King Varian Wrynn, have brought its armies to Northrend with the goal of avenging the Alliance Kingdom of Lordaeron, whose betrayal and destruction at the hands of Prince Arthas Menethil was engineered by the Lich King. The Alliance controls Valiance Keep and Valgarde in the Borean Tundra and Howling Fjord respectively, as well as Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight.\\r\\nThe Forsaken and their Banshee Queen, Sylvanas Windrunner, have also arrived with a new contagion that they hope will prove to be effective against the undead minions of the Lich King. The Forsaken are seeking vengeance for being subjected to Arthas's magic. They have set up a military base of operations called \\"Vengeance Landing\\" and have created a settlement called \\"New Agamand,\\" both in the Howling Fjord. The magi of Dalaran have also relocated, along with their city, to Northrend in order to deal with the rising threat of the Blue Dragonflight, led by Malygos the Spell-Weaver, and the Lich King. The city of Dalaran functions as the neutral sanctuary city for the continent, analogous to Shattrath City in Outland. Dalaran is levitating at a great height above the Crystalsong Forest zone but can be accessed by either the ground or by flying mount.[14] The expansion also features more creatures and other enemies, such as the four new spirit beasts: Loque'nahak, Gondria, Skoll and Arcturis. It also introduces the vicious dragons called Proto-Drakes (dragons with short arms, huge teeth and large wings) and the gigantic dinosaur named King Krush, who stalks the jungles of Sholazar Basin. Arthas Menethil, the Lich King, is the primary antagonist of the expansion.\\r\\nIn the wake of the Sunwell's purification, a period of suspicious silence swept over the world. As if on cue, the undead Scourge launched a massive assault against the cities and towns of Azeroth, this time extending its reach far beyond the Eastern Kingdoms. Under pressure to respond with a full army, Warchief Thrall deployed an expedition force to Northrend led by Overlord Garrosh Hellscream. Meanwhile, the missing human king Varian Wrynn at last returned to Stormwind City and reclaimed his crown. He sent an equally powerful Alliance army, commanded by Bolvar Fordragon, to defeat the Lich Kingand any Horde forces who would stand in their way.\\r\\nThe Alliance and Horde (led by Dranosh Saurfang) eventually led a combined offensive on the Wrathgate, the entrance to the Lich King's fortress of Icecrown Citadel. Before they could succeed however, Grand Apothecary Putress and his Royal Apothecary Society followers (renegade Forsaken) unleashed a new plague that killed friend and foe alike, while his traitorous counterpart, the dreadlord Varimathras, seized the Undercity in a coup that nearly killed Sylvanas. The usurpers were slain for their vile deeds by armies of the Alliance and Horde and the Forsaken capital was restored. The debacle however, created suspicion among the Horde regarding Sylvanas's loyalties. At the Wrathgate, many brave Alliance soldiers died at the hands of the Forsaken's Royal Apothecary Society; including King Varian's dear friend Bolvar Fordragon. Varian, who had always been wary of the orcs, discovered that the Royal Apothecary Society had been developing the new plague for years. The events that transpired during the battle for the Undercity convinced the human king that the Horde had been left unchecked for too long and he becomes hostile to the Horde for the rest of the campaign in Northrend.\\r\\nThe march of Horde and Alliance armies through Northrend led to a number of victories, but these successes paled before a discovery made by the explorer Brann Bronzebeard within the ancient titan complex of Ulduar. This mysterious fortress had long served as the prison of the Old God Yogg-Saron, a being of unfathomable evil whose influence had spread into the continent of Northrend itself. However, the safeguards keeping Yogg-Saron imprisoned have begun to fail, and the Old God's influence has already corrupted Ulduar's guardians. With Brann's assistance, small bands of Alliance and Horde champions infiltrated Ulduar to confront Yogg-Saron, who blasted the invaders with cryptic visions: the millennia-old creation of an artifact known as the Dragon Soul, the assassination of Stormwind's King Llane, and a glimpse of the Lich King's future. However, the heroes manage to prevail and destroy Yogg-Saron.\\r\\nIn preparation for the final offensive against the Lich King, the Argent Crusade (a union of holy warriors from the Order of the Silver Hand and the Argent Dawn) assembled a base near Icecrown Citadel to gather resources and identify the champions who would serve at the vanguard of their army. Highlord Tirion Fordring organized a tournament to test potential heroes of the Horde and the Alliance, but agents of the Scourge quickly emerged to sabotage the event. The undead attack culminated with the appearance of the monstrous crypt lord Anub'arak, who attempted to exterminate Tirion's elite force before it could be assembled. Fortunately, the gathered heroes prove to be too much for Anub'arak to handle and he is defeated.\\r\\nAs the final battle against the Lich King approached, the human sorceress Jaina Proudmoore and the Banshee Queen Sylvanas Windrunner journeyed to the icy heart of Northrend. Both had come for different reasons: Jaina hoped to discover whether a part of her former friend and lover, Arthas Menethil, still lived; Sylvanas longed to take revenge on her old enemy. With the aid of these two heroes, Azeroth's champions stormed Icecrown Citadel and vanquished the Lich King's minions. Their confrontation with the Lich King involved thousands of souls consumed by Arthas's blade, Frostmourne. Ultimately, Arthas was slain with the aid of Tirion Fordring, and the heroes who triumphed over him learned a chilling truth about the existence of the undead Scourge. Without a Lich King, the leaderless undead would go on an unstoppable rampage across Azeroth. Bolvar (revealed to have been altered by the red dragons' flame), steps forward and voluntarily becomes the new Lich King, promising to keep the Scourge contained in Northrend as its eternal jailer.\\r\\nWorld of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King was announced on August 3, 2007, on the first day of BlizzCon 2007.[16][17] Several enhancements to World of Warcraft's graphics engine were added with the release of Wrath of the Lich King. These include the use of a new shader in areas containing ice,[18] new fire effects, more realistic shadows, and the option to turn down character texture resolution to improve performance.\\r\\nOn October 15, 2008, Patch 3.0.2, titled 'Wrath of the Lich King', was released to pave the way for the upcoming expansion, bringing many of the expansion's updated systems to the game pre-release.[19] Several new features were added including an all new class called the Death Knight. Classes received new spells and abilities. A harbor was added to Stormwind and new Zeppelin towers outside Orgrimmar and Tirisfal Glades. Wrath of the Lich King was released on November 13, 2008.\\r\\nPatch 3.1.0, 'Secrets of Ulduar', was released April 15, 2009.[20] Players discovered the titan city of Ulduar to learn it was a prison keeping the Old God of Death, Yogg-Saron inside. New content along with the new raid, Ulduar, was added including the new Argent Tournament Grounds. The dual talent specialization and the equipment manager were added to the UI. Patch 3.2, 'Call of the Crusade', was released August 5, 2009.[21] Since release of Argent Tournament in patch 3.1.0, players have been fighting champions of each faction. Patch 3.2.0 added the Crusader's Coliseum raid, a PvP season 7, a new Battleground, Isle of Conquest and some Argent Tournament quests. The final major patch for the expansion, Patch 3.3, 'Fall of the Lich King', was released on December 9, 2009.[22] It added the Icecrown Citadel raid, where players would fight the Lich King and the main storyline came to a conclusion. Other new content included the Kaluak Fishing Derby. Cross server LFG (looking for group), which allowed players from different servers to play together in a dungeon. Patch 3.3.5, released on June 22, 2010, was a minor content patch that released the Ruby Sanctum raid and added cross-game chat using Battle.net. The raid features fighting against the black dragonflight that is attempting to destroy the Sanctum to facilitate Deathwing's reemergence.\\r\\nOn September 19, 2012, the Wrath of the Lich King expansion was completely merged with the original World of Warcraft game, just as the Burning Crusade expansion was the previous year. Now all players who purchase the original game automatically receive The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King at no additional cost. This merging of the expansions with the original game is called a \\"Battle Chest\\".[23]\\r\\nWrath of the Lich King was critically acclaimed, scoring a 91 on Metacritic.[36] Since its release, this expansion has often been recognized as World of Warcraft's best expansion by critics and fans.[37] The game reached its peak in October 2010 with over 12 million subscribers.[38]\\r\\nThe set sold 2.8 million copies within the first 24 hours of availability.[39] This had made it the fastest selling computer game of all time, beating the record set by the previous World of Warcraft expansion The Burning Crusade, which had sold 2.4 million within its first 24 hours.[40] It received a \\"Gold\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA),[41] indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.[42] It later lost its rank as number one after Blizzard released Diablo III, which sold over 3.5 million copies within its first 24 hours on the market.[43]","input":"When was wrath of the lich king announced?"},{"output":"5 million square kilometres","context":"","input":"How big was the roman empire at its height?"},{"output":"Notre Dame","context":"The NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament is an annual college basketball tournament for women. Held each March, the Women's Championship was inaugurated in the 1981ÿ82 season. The NCAA tournament was preceded by the AIAW Women's Basketball Tournament, which was held annually from 1972 to 1982. Basketball was one of 12 women's sports added to the NCAA championship program for the 1981ÿ82 school year, as the NCAA engaged in battle with the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women for sole governance of women's collegiate sports. The AIAW continued to conduct its established championship program in the same 12 (and other) sports; however, after a year of dual women's championships, the NCAA prevailed, while the AIAW disbanded.\\r\\nAttendance and interest in the Women's Division I Championship have grown over the years, especially from 2003 to 2016, when the final championship game was moved to the Tuesday following the Monday men's championship game.[1] The women's championship game is the penultimate overall game of the college basketball season since 2017. From 1982 to 1990, 1996 to 2002, and since 2017 the Women's Final Four is usually played on the Friday before the Men's Final Four or the hours before the men played on the final Saturday of the tournament. The final was usually played the Sunday afternoon following the Men's Final Four; since 2017, Sunday evening.\\r\\nThe tournament bracket is made up of champions from each Division I conference, which receive automatic bids. The remaining slots are at-large bids, with teams chosen by an NCAA selection committee. The selection process and tournament seedings are based on several factors, including team rankings, win-loss records, and Ratings Percentage Index (RPI) data.\\r\\nUnlike the men's tournament, there are only 32 at-large bids (since 2014), and no play-in game. The women's tournament, like the men's, is staged in a single elimination format and is part of the media and public frenzy known colloquially as March Madness or The Big Dance.\\r\\nAll 63 games have been broadcast on television since 2003 on ESPN and ESPN2.[2] Similar to the pre-2011 men's tournament coverage on CBS, local teams are shown on each channel when available, with \\"whip-around\\" coverage designed to showcase the most competitive contests in the rest of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of 64 teams qualify for the tournament played in March and April. Of these teams, 32 earn automatic bids by winning their respective conference tournaments. Since 2017 the Ivy League conducts their own post-season tournament. The remaining teams are granted \\"at-large\\" bids, which are extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. Dr. Marilyn McNeil, vice president/director of athletics at Monmouth University is the current chairwoman. On March 1, 2011, Bowling Green State University's director of intercollegiate athletics, Greg Christopher, was appointed chair of the NCAA Division I Womens Basketball Committee during the 2011ÿ12 academic year.[3]\\r\\nThe tournament is split into four regional tournaments, and each regional has teams seeded from 1 to 16, with the committee ostensibly making every region as comparable to the others as possible[citation needed]. The top-seeded team in each region plays the #16 team, the #2 team plays the #15, etc.\\r\\nThe first NCAA women's basketball tournament was held in 1982. The AIAW also held a basketball tournament in 1982, but most of the top teams, including defending AIAW champion Louisiana Tech, decided to participate in the NCAA tournament.\\r\\nThe championship consisted of 32 teams from 1982ÿ1985 (in 1983, 36), 40 teams from 1986ÿ1988, and 48 teams from 1989ÿ1993. Since 1994, 64 teams compete in each tournament.\\r\\nPrior to 1996, seeding was conducted on a regional basis. The top teams (eight in the 32-, 40-, and 48-team formats, and 16 in the 64-team format) were ranked and seeded on a national basis. The remaining teams were then seeded based on their geographic region. Teams were moved outside of its geographic region only if it was necessary to balance the bracket, or if the proximity of an opponent outside of its region would be comparable and a more competitive game would result. In 1993, all teams except for the top four were explicitly unseeded. The regional seeding resumed in 1994. In 1996, seeds were assigned on a national basis using an \\"S-Curve\\" format[clarification needed] similar to the process used in selecting the field for the men's tournament.\\r\\nThe following table summarizes some of the key attributes of the seeding process:[4]\\r\\n? Some exceptions. Due to venue availability, in some cases, the lower seed hosted, or the game was played at a neutral site.\\r\\n? From 2003ÿ2014, sixteen predetermined sites were selected for first and second-round games. Teams were allowed to play at home, if hosting.\\r\\nBetween 2005 and 2008, eight sites were used for first-round games.\\r\\nA special selection committee appointed by the NCAA determines which 64 teams will enter the tournament, and where they will be seeded and placed in the bracket. Because of the automatic bids, only 32 teams (the at-large bids) rely on the selection committee to secure them a spot in the tournament.\\r\\nNote: Conferences are listed by all champions' affiliations at that time; these do not necessarily match current affiliations.\\r\\nSince the women's tournament began in 1982, 16 teams have entered the tournament ranked #1 in at least 1 poll and gone on to win the tournament:\\r\\nOnly once has the reigning champion (the previous year's winner) not made it to the tournament the next year.\\r\\nSince 1982, at least one #1 seed has made the Final Four every year.\\r\\nUnder coach Geno Auriemma, Connecticut has been seeded #1 a record 22 times.

The novel's protagonist, Howard Roark, is an individualistic young architect who designs modernist buildings and refuses to compromise with an architectural establishment unwilling to accept innovation. Roark embodies what Rand believed to be the ideal man, and his struggle reflects Rand's belief that individualism is superior to collectivism.\\r\\nRoark is opposed by what he calls \\"second-handers\\", who value conformity over independence and integrity. These include Roark's former classmate, Peter Keating, who succeeds by following popular styles, but turns to Roark for help with design problems. Ellsworth Toohey, a socialist architecture critic who uses his influence to promote his political and social agenda, tries to destroy Roark's career. Tabloid newspaper publisher Gail Wynand seeks to shape popular opinion; he befriends Roark, then betrays him when public opinion turns in a direction he cannot control. The novel's most controversial character is Roark's lover, Dominique Francon. She believes that non-conformity has no chance of winning, so she alternates between helping Roark and working to undermine him. Feminist critics have condemned Roark and Dominique's first sexual encounter, accusing Rand of endorsing rape.\\r\\nTwelve publishers rejected the manuscript before an editor at the Bobbs-Merrill Company risked his job to get it published. Contemporary reviewers' opinions were mixed. Some praised the novel as a powerful paean to individualism, while others thought it overlong and lacking sympathetic characters. Initial sales were slow, but the book gained a following by word of mouth and became a bestseller. More than 6.5?million copies of The Fountainhead have been sold worldwide and it has been translated into more than 20 languages. The novel attracted a new following for Rand and has enjoyed a lasting influence, especially among architects and right-libertarians.\\r\\nThe novel has been adapted into other media several times. An illustrated version was syndicated in newspapers in 1945. Warner Bros. produced a film version in 1949; Rand wrote the screenplay, and Gary Cooper played Roark. Critics panned the film, which did not recoup its budget; several directors and writers have considered developing a new film adaptation. In 2014, Belgian theater director Ivo van Hove created a stage adaptation, which has received mostly positive reviews.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1922, Howard Roark is expelled from the architecture department of the Stanton Institute of Technology because he will not adhere to the school's preference for historical convention in building design. Roark goes to New York City and gets a job with Henry Cameron. Cameron was once a renowned architect, but now gets few commissions. In the meantime, Roark's popular, but vacuous, school roommate Peter Keating (whom Roark sometimes helped with projects) graduates with high honors. He too moves to New York, where he has been offered a position with the prestigious architecture firm, Francon & Heyer. Keating ingratiates himself with senior partner Guy Francon and works to remove rivals within his firm. Eventually, he is made a partner. Meanwhile, Roark and Cameron create inspired work, but struggle financially.\\r\\nAfter Cameron retires, Keating hires Roark, whom Francon soon fires for refusing to design a building in the classical style. Roark works briefly at another firm, then opens his own office but has trouble finding clients and closes it down. He gets a job in a granite quarry owned by Francon. There he meets Francon's daughter Dominique, a columnist for The New York Banner, while she is staying at her family's estate nearby. They are immediately attracted to each other, leading to a rough sexual encounter that Dominique later calls a rape.[1] Shortly after, Roark is notified that a client is ready to start a new building, and he returns to New York. Dominique also returns to New York and learns Roark is an architect. She attacks his work in public, but visits him for secret sexual encounters.\\r\\nEllsworth M. Toohey, who writes a popular architecture column in the Banner, is an outspoken socialist who shapes public opinion through his column and a circle of influential associates. Toohey sets out to destroy Roark through a smear campaign. He recommends Roark to Hopton Stoddard, a wealthy acquaintance who wants to build a Temple of the Human Spirit. Roark's unusual design includes a nude statue modeled on Dominique; Toohey convinces Stoddard to sue Roark for malpractice. Toohey and several architects (including Keating) testify at the trial that Roark is incompetent as an architect due to his rejection of historical styles. Dominique speaks in Roark's defense, but he loses the case. Dominique decides that since she cannot have the world she wants, in which men like Roark are recognized for their greatness, she will live entirely in the world she has, which shuns Roark and praises Keating. She marries Keating and turns herself over to him, doing and saying whatever he wants, such as persuading potential clients to hire him instead of Roark.\\r\\nTo win Keating a prestigious commission offered by Gail Wynand, the owner and editor-in-chief of the Banner, Dominique agrees to sleep with Wynand. Wynand is so strongly attracted to Dominique that he pays Keating to divorce her, after which Wynand and Dominique are married. Wanting to build a home for himself and his new wife, Wynand discovers that Roark designed every building he likes and so hires him. Roark and Wynand become close friends; Wynand is unaware of Roark's past relationship with Dominique.\\r\\nWashed up and out of the public eye, Keating pleads with Toohey to use his influence to get the commission for the much-sought-after Cortlandt housing project. Keating knows his most successful projects were aided by Roark, so he asks for Roark's help in designing Cortlandt. Roark agrees in exchange for complete anonymity and Keating's promise that it will be built exactly as designed. After taking a long vacation with Wynand, Roark returns to find that Keating was not able to prevent major changes from being made in Cortlandt's construction. Roark dynamites the project to prevent the subversion of his vision.\\r\\nRoark is arrested and his action is widely condemned, but Wynand decides to use his papers to defend his friend. This unpopular stance hurts the circulation of his newspapers, and Wynand's employees go on strike after Wynand dismisses Toohey for disobeying him and criticizing Roark. Faced with the prospect of closing the paper, Wynand gives in and publishes a denunciation of Roark. At his trial, Roark makes a speech about the value of ego and integrity, and he is found not guilty. Dominique leaves Wynand for Roark. Wynand, who has betrayed his own values by attacking Roark, finally grasps the nature of the power he thought he held. He shuts down the Banner and commissions a final building from Roark, a skyscraper that will serve as a monument to human achievement. Eighteen months later, the Wynand Building is under construction. Dominique, now Roark's wife, enters the site to meet him atop its steel framework.\\r\\nRand's stated goal in writing fiction was to portray her vision of an ideal man.[2][3] The character of Howard Roark, the protagonist of The Fountainhead, was the first instance where she believed she had achieved this.[4] Roark embodies Rand's egoistic moral ideals,[5] especially the virtues of independence[6] and integrity.[7]\\r\\nThe character of Roark was at least partly inspired by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Rand described the inspiration as limited to specific ideas he had about architecture and \\"the pattern of his career\\".[8] She denied that Wright had anything to do with the philosophy expressed by Roark or the events of the plot.[9][10] Rand's denials have not stopped commentators from claiming stronger connections between Wright and Roark.[10][11] Wright equivocated about whether he thought Roark was based on him, sometimes implying that he did, at other times denying it.[12] Wright biographer Ada Louise Huxtable described significant differences between Wright's philosophy and Rand's, and quoted him declaring, \\"I deny the paternity and refuse to marry the mother.\\"[13] Architecture critic Martin Filler said that Roark resembles the Swiss-French modernist architect Le Corbusier more closely than Wright.[14]\\r\\nIn contrast to the individualistic Roark, Peter Keating is a conformist who bases his choices on what others want. Introduced to the reader as Roark's classmate in architecture school, Keating does not really want to be an architect. He loves painting, but his mother steers him toward architecture instead.[15] In this as in all his decisions, Keating does what others expect rather than follow his personal interests. He becomes a social climber, focused on improving his career and social standing using a combination of personal manipulation and conformity to popular styles.[15][16][17] He follows a similar path in his private life: He chooses a loveless marriage to Dominique instead of marrying the woman he loveswho lacks Dominique's beauty and social connections. By middle age, Keating's career is in decline and he is unhappy with his path, but it is too late for him to change.[18][19]\\r\\nRand did not use a specific architect as a model for Keating.[20] Her inspiration for the character came from a neighbor she knew while working in Hollywood in the early 1930s. Rand asked this young woman to explain her goals in life. The woman's response was focused on social comparisons: the neighbor wanted her material possessions and social standing to equal or exceed those of other people. Rand created Keating as an archetype of this motivation, which she saw as the opposite of self-interest.[21]\\r\\nDominique Francon is the heroine of The Fountainhead, described by Rand as \\"the woman for a man like Howard Roark\\".[22] Rand described Dominique as similar to herself \\"in a bad mood\\".[23] For most of the novel, the character operates from what Rand viewed as wrong ideas.[24] Believing that the values she admires cannot survive in the real world, she chooses to turn away from them so that the world cannot harm her. Only at the end of the novel does she accept that she can be happy and survive.[23][25][26]\\r\\nThe character has provoked varied reactions from commentators. Philosopher Chris Matthew Sciabarra called her \\"one of the more bizarre characters in the novel\\".[27] Literature scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein called her \\"an interesting case study in perverseness\\".[17] Writer Tore Boeckmann described her as a character with conflicting beliefs and saw her actions as a logical representation of how those conflicts might play out.[28]\\r\\nGail Wynand is a wealthy newspaper mogul who rose from a destitute childhood in the ghettoes of New York to control much of the city's print media. While Wynand shares many of the character qualities of Roark, his success is dependent upon his ability to pander to public opinion. Rand presents this as a tragic flaw that eventually leads to his downfall. In her journals Rand described Wynand as \\"the man who could have been\\" a heroic individualist, contrasting him to Roark, \\"the man who can be and is\\".[29][30] Some elements of Wynand's character were inspired by real-life newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst,[29][31][32] including Hearst's yellow journalism and mixed success in attempts to gain political influence.[29] Wynand ultimately fails in his attempts to wield power, losing his newspaper, his wife, and his friendship with Roark.[33] The character has been interpreted as a representation of the master morality described by philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche;[34] his tragic nature illustrates Rand's rejection of Nietzsche's philosophy.[30][35][36] In Rand's view, a person like Wynand, who seeks power over others, is as much a \\"second-hander\\" as a conformist such as Keating.[37][38][39]\\r\\nEllsworth Monkton Toohey is Roark's antagonist. He is Rand's personification of evilthe most active and self-aware villain in any of her novels.[18][40][41] Toohey is a socialist, and represents the spirit of collectivism more generally. He styles himself as representative of the will of the masses, but his actual desire is for power over others.[18][42] He controls individual victims by destroying their sense of self-worth, and seeks broader power (over \\"the world\\", as he declares to Keating in a moment of candor) by promoting the ideals of ethical altruism and a rigorous egalitarianism that treats all people and achievements as equally valuable.[40][43] Rand used her memory of the British democratic socialist Harold Laski to help her imagine what Toohey would do in a given situation. She attended a New York lecture by Laski as part of gathering material for the novel, following which she changed the physical appearance of the character to be similar to that of Laski.[44] New York intellectuals Lewis Mumford and Clifton Fadiman also helped inspire the character.[31][32]\\r\\nWhen Rand first arrived in New York as an immigrant from the Soviet Union in 1926, she was greatly impressed by the Manhattan skyline's towering skyscrapers, which she saw as symbols of freedom, and resolved that she would write about them.[45][46] In 1927, Rand was working as a junior screenwriter for movie producer Cecil B. DeMille when he asked her to write a script for what would become the 1928 film Skyscraper. The original story by Dudley Murphy was about two construction workers working on a skyscraper who are rivals for a woman's love. Rand rewrote it, transforming the rivals into architects. One of them, Howard Kane, was an idealist dedicated to erecting the skyscraper despite enormous obstacles. The film would have ended with Kane standing atop the completed skyscraper. DeMille rejected Rand's script, and the completed film followed Murphy's original idea. Rand's version contained elements she would use in The Fountainhead.[47][48]\\r\\nIn 1928, Rand made notes for a proposed, but never written, novel titled The Little Street.[49] Rand's notes for it contain elements that carried over into her work on The Fountainhead.[50] David Harriman, who edited the notes for the posthumously published Journals of Ayn Rand (1997), described the story's villain as a preliminary version of the character Ellsworth Toohey, and this villain's assassination by the protagonist as prefiguring the attempted assassination of Toohey.[51]\\r\\nRand began The Fountainhead (originally titled Second-Hand Lives) following the completion of her first novel, We the Living, in 1934. That earlier novel was based in part on people and events familiar to Rand; the new novel, on the other hand, focused on the less-familiar world of architecture. She therefore conducted extensive research that included reading many biographies and other books about architecture.[52] She also worked as an unpaid typist in the office of architect Ely Jacques Kahn.[53] Rand began her notes for the new novel in December 1935.[54]\\r\\nRand wanted to write a novel that was less overtly political than We the Living, to avoid being viewed as \\"a 'one-theme' author\\".[55] As she developed the story, she began to see more political meaning in the novel's ideas about individualism.[56] Rand also planned to introduce the novel's four sections with quotes from Friedrich Nietzsche, whose ideas had influenced her own intellectual development, but she eventually decided that Nietzsche's ideas were too different from hers. She edited the final manuscript to remove the quotes and other allusions to him.[57][58]\\r\\nRand's work on The Fountainhead was repeatedly interrupted. In 1937, she took a break from it to write a novella called Anthem. She also completed a stage adaptation of We the Living that ran briefly in 1940.[59] That same year, she became active in politics. She first worked as a volunteer in Wendell Willkie's presidential campaign, and then attempted to form a group for conservative intellectuals.[60] As her royalties from earlier projects ran out, she began doing freelance work as a script reader for movie studios. When Rand finally found a publisher, the novel was only one-third complete.[61]\\r\\nAlthough she was a previously published novelist and had a successful Broadway play, Rand had difficulty finding a publisher for The Fountainhead. Macmillan Publishing, which had published We the Living, rejected the book after Rand insisted they provide more publicity for her new novel than they had done for the first one.[62] Rand's agent began submitting the book to other publishers; in 1938, Knopf signed a contract to publish the book. When Rand was only a quarter done with the manuscript by October 1940, Knopf canceled her contract.[63] Several other publishers rejected the book. When Rand's agent began to criticize the novel, Rand fired the agent and decided to handle submissions herself.[64] Twelve publishers (including Macmillan and Knopf) rejected the book.[61][65][66]\\r\\nWhile Rand was working as a script reader for Paramount Pictures, her boss put her in touch with the Bobbs-Merrill Company. A recently hired editor, Archibald Ogden, liked the book, but two internal reviewers gave conflicting opinions. One said it was a great book that would never sell; the other said it was trash but would sell well. Ogden's boss, Bobbs-Merrill president D.L. Chambers, decided to reject the book. Ogden responded by wiring to the head office, \\"If this is not the book for you, then I am not the editor for you.\\" His strong stand won Rand the contract on December 10, 1941. She also got a $1,000 advance so she could work full-time to complete the novel by January 1, 1943.[67][68]\\r\\nRand worked long hours through 1942 to complete the final two-thirds of her manuscript, which she delivered on December 31, 1942.[68][69] Rand's working title for the book was Second-Hand Lives, but Ogden pointed out that this emphasized the story's villains. Rand offered The Mainspring as an alternative, but this title had been recently used for another book. She then used a thesaurus and found 'fountainhead' as a synonym.[65] The Fountainhead was published on May 7, 1943, with 7,500 copies in the first printing. Initial sales were slow, but they began to rise in the fall of 1943, driven primarily by word of mouth.[70][71] The novel began appearing on bestseller lists in 1944.[72] It reached number six on The New York Times bestseller list in August 1945, over two years after its initial publication.[73] By 1956, the hardcover edition sold over 700,000 copies.[74] The first paperback edition was published by New American Library in 1952.[75]\\r\\nA 25th anniversary edition was issued by New American Library in 1971, including a new introduction by Rand. In 1993, a 50th anniversary edition from Bobbs-Merrill added an afterword by Rand's heir, Leonard Peikoff.[76] The novel has been translated into more than 25 languages.[note 1]\\r\\nRand indicated that the primary theme of The Fountainhead was \\"individualism versus collectivism, not in politics but within a man's soul\\".[78] Philosopher Douglas Den Uyl identified the individualism presented in the novel as being specifically of an American kind, portrayed in the context of that country's society and institutions.[79] Apart from scenes such as Roark's courtroom defense of the American concept of individual rights, she avoided direct discussion of political issues. As historian James Baker described it, \\"The Fountainhead hardly mentions politics or economics, despite the fact that it was born in the 1930s. Nor does it deal with world affairs, although it was written during World War II. It is about one man against the system, and it does not permit other matters to intrude.\\"[80] Early drafts of the novel included more explicit political references, but Rand removed them from the finished text.[81]\\r\\nRand chose the profession of architecture as the background for her novel, although she knew nothing about the field beforehand.[82] As a field that combines art, technology, and business, it allowed her to illustrate her primary themes in multiple areas.[83] Rand later wrote that architects provide \\"both art and a basic need of men's survival\\".[82] In a speech to a chapter of the American Institute of Architects, Rand drew a connection between architecture and individualism, saying time periods that had improvements in architecture were also those that had more freedom for the individual.[84]\\r\\nRoark's modernist approach to architecture is contrasted with that of most of the other architects in the novel. In the opening chapter, the dean of his architecture school tells Roark that the best architecture must copy the past rather than innovate or improve.[85] Roark repeatedly loses jobs with architectural firms and commissions from clients because he is unwilling to copy conventional architectural styles. In contrast, Keating's mimicry of convention brings him top honors in school and an immediate job offer.[86] The same conflict between innovation and tradition is reflected in the career of Roark's mentor, Henry Cameron.[87]\\r\\nDen Uyl calls The Fountainhead a \\"philosophical novel\\", meaning that it addresses philosophical ideas and offers a specific philosophical viewpoint about those ideas.[88] In the years following the publication of The Fountainhead, Rand developed a philosophical system that she called Objectivism. The Fountainhead does not contain this explicit philosophy,[89] and Rand did not write the novel primarily to convey philosophical ideas.[90] Nonetheless, Rand included three excerpts from the novel in For the New Intellectual, a 1961 collection of her writings that she described as an outline of Objectivism.[91] Peikoff used many quotes and examples from The Fountainhead in his 1991 book on Rand's philosophy, Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand.[92]\\r\\nThe Fountainhead polarized critics and received mixed reviews upon its release.[93] The reviewer for The New York Times praised Rand as writing \\"brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly\\", stating that she had \\"written a hymn in praise of the individual\\" that would force readers to rethink basic ideas.[94] Benjamin DeCasseres, a columnist for the New York Journal-American, described Roark as \\"one of the most inspiring characters in modern American literature\\". Rand sent DeCasseres a letter thanking him for explaining the book's themes about individualism when many other reviewers did not.[95] There were other positive reviews, although Rand dismissed many of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications.[93] A number of negative reviews focused on the length of the novel,[96] such as one that called it \\"a whale of a book\\" and another that said \\"anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing\\". Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style \\"offensively pedestrian\\".[93]\\r\\nIn the years following its initial publication, The Fountainhead has received relatively little attention from literary critics.[97][98] Assessing the novel's legacy, philosopher Douglas Den Uyl described The Fountainhead as relatively neglected compared to her later novel, Atlas Shrugged, and said, \\"our problem is to find those topics that arise clearly with The Fountainhead and yet do not force us to read it simply through the eyes of Atlas Shrugged.\\"[97] Among critics who have addressed it, some consider The Fountainhead to be Rand's best novel,[99][100][101] although in some cases this assessment is tempered by an overall negative judgment of Rand's writings.[102][103] Purely negative evaluations have also continued; a 2011 overview of American literature said \\"mainstream literary culture dismissed [The Fountainhead] in the 1940s and continues to dismiss it\\".[104]\\r\\nOne of the most controversial elements of the book is the first sexual encounter between Roark and Dominique.[105] Feminist critics have attacked the scene as representative of an antifeminist viewpoint in Rand's works that makes women subservient to men.[106] Susan Brownmiller, in her 1975 work Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape, denounced what she called \\"Rand's philosophy of rape\\", for portraying women as wanting \\"humiliation at the hands of a superior man\\". She called Rand \\"a traitor to her own sex\\".[107] Susan Love Brown said the scene presents Rand's view of sex as sadomasochism involving \\"feminine subordination and passivity\\".[108] Barbara Grizzuti Harrison suggested women who enjoy such \\"masochistic fantasies\\" are \\"damaged\\" and have low self-esteem.[109] While Mimi Reisel Gladstein found elements to admire in Rand's female protagonists, she said that readers who have \\"a raised consciousness about the nature of rape\\" would disapprove of Rand's \\"romanticized rapes\\".[110]\\r\\nRand's posthumously published working notes for the novel indicate that when she started on the book in 1936, she conceived of Roark's character that \\"were it necessary, he could rape her and feel justified\\".[111] She denied that what happened in the finished novel was actually rape, referring to it as \\"rape by engraved invitation\\".[105] She said Dominique wanted and \\"all but invited\\" the act, citing, among other things, a passage where Dominique scratches a marble slab in her bedroom to invite Roark to repair it.[112] A true rape, Rand said, would be \\"a dreadful crime\\".[113] Defenders of the novel have agreed with this interpretation. In an essay specifically explaining this scene, Andrew Bernstein wrote that although much \\"confusion\\" exists about it, the descriptions in the novel provide \\"conclusive\\" evidence of Dominique's strong attraction to Roark and her desire to have sex with him.[114] Individualist feminist Wendy McElroy said that while Dominique is \\"thoroughly taken,\\" there is nonetheless \\"clear indication\\" that Dominique both gave consent for and enjoyed the experience.[115] Both Bernstein and McElroy saw the interpretations of feminists such as Brownmiller as based in a false understanding of sexuality.[115][116]\\r\\nAlthough Rand had some mainstream success previously with her play Night of January 16th and had two previously published novels, The Fountainhead was a major breakthrough in her career. It brought her lasting fame and financial success. She sold the movie rights to The Fountainhead and returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay for the adaptation.[117] In April 1944, she signed a multiyear contract with movie producer Hal Wallis to write original screenplays and adaptations of other writers' works.[118]\\r\\nThe success of the novel brought Rand new publishing opportunities. Bobbs-Merrill offered to publish a nonfiction book expanding on the ethical ideas presented in The Fountainhead. Though this book was never completed, a portion of the material was used for an article in the January 1944 issue of Reader's Digest.[119] Rand was also able to get an American publisher for Anthem, which previously had been published in England, but not in the United States.[120] When she was ready to submit Atlas Shrugged to publishers, over a dozen competed to acquire the new book.[121]\\r\\nThe Fountainhead also attracted a new group of fans who were attracted to its philosophical ideas. When she moved back to New York in 1951, she gathered a group of these admirers of whom she referred publicly as \\"the Class of '43\\" in reference to the year The Fountainhead was published. The group evolved into the core of the Objectivist movement that promoted the philosophical ideas from Rand's writing.[122][123]\\r\\nThe Fountainhead has continued to have strong sales throughout the last century into the current one. By 2008, it had sold over 6.5?million copies in English. It has also been referenced in a variety of popular entertainments, including movies, television series, and other novels.[124][125]\\r\\nThe year 1943 also saw the publication of The God of the Machine by Isabel Paterson and The Discovery of Freedom by Rose Wilder Lane. Rand, Lane, and Paterson have been referred to as the founding mothers of the American libertarian movement with the publication of these works.[126] Journalist John Chamberlain, for example, credited these works with converting him from socialism to what he called \\"an older American philosophy\\" of libertarian and conservative ideas.[127] Literature professor Philip R. Yannella said the novel is \\"a central text of American conservative and libertarian political culture\\".[104]\\r\\nThe book has a particular appeal to young people, an appeal that led historian James Baker to describe it as \\"more important than its detractors think, although not as important as Rand fans imagine\\".[100] Philosopher Allan Bloom said the novel is \\"hardly literature\\", but when he asked his students which books mattered to them, someone always was influenced by The Fountainhead.[128] Journalist Nora Ephron wrote that she had loved the novel when she was 18, but admitted that she \\"missed the point\\", which she suggested is largely subliminal sexual metaphor. Ephron wrote that she decided upon rereading that \\"it is better read when one is young enough to miss the point. Otherwise, one cannot help thinking it is a very silly book.\\"[129]\\r\\nThe Fountainhead has been cited by numerous architects as an inspiration for their work. Architect Fred Stitt, founder of the San Francisco Institute of Architecture, dedicated a book to his \\"first architectural mentor, Howard Roark\\".[130] According to architectural photographer Julius Shulman, Rand's work \\"brought architecture into the public's focus for the first time\\". He said The Fountainhead was not only influential among 20th century architects, but also it \\"was one, first, front and center in the life of every architect who was a modern architect\\".[131] The novel also had a significant impact on the public perception of architecture.[132][133][134] During his campaign for U.S. President, real estate developer Donald Trump praised the novel, saying he identified with Roark.[135]\\r\\nIn 1949, Warner Bros. released a film based on the book, starring Gary Cooper as Howard Roark, Patricia Neal as Dominique Francon, Raymond Massey as Gail Wynand, and Kent Smith as Peter Keating. Rand, who had previous experience as a screenwriter, was hired to adapt her own novel. The film was directed by King Vidor. It grossed $2.1?million, $400,000 less than its production budget.[136] Critics panned the movie. Negative reviews appeared in publications ranging from newspapers such as The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, to movie industry outlets such as Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, to magazines such as Time and Good Housekeeping.[136][137]\\r\\nIn letters written at the time, Rand's reaction to the film was positive. She said it was the most faithful adaptation of a novel ever made in Hollywood[138] and a \\"real triumph\\".[139] Sales of the novel increased as a result of interest spurred by the film.[140] She displayed a more negative attitude later, saying she disliked the entire movie and complaining about its editing, acting, and other elements.[141] Rand said she would never sell rights to another novel to a film company that did not allow her to pick the director and screenwriter, as well as edit the film.[142]\\r\\nVarious filmmakers have expressed interest in doing new adaptations of The Fountainhead, although none of these potential films has begun production. In the 1970s, writer-director Michael Cimino wanted to film his own script for United Artists. In 1992, producer James Hill optioned the rights and selected Phil Joanou to direct.[143] In the 2000s, Oliver Stone was interested in directing a new adaptation; Brad Pitt was reportedly under consideration to play Roark.[144] In a March 2016 interview, director Zack Snyder also expressed interest in doing a new film adaptation of The Fountainhead.[145]\\r\\nIn 1944, Omnibook Magazine produced an abridged edition of the novel that was sold to members of the United States Armed Forces. Rand was annoyed that Bobbs-Merrill allowed the edited version to be published without her approval of the text.[146] King Features Syndicate approached Rand the following year about creating a condensed, illustrated version of the novel for syndication in newspapers. Rand agreed, provided that she could oversee the editing and approve the proposed illustrations of her characters, which were provided by Frank Godwin. The 30-part series began on December 24, 1945, and ran in over 35 newspapers.[147] Rand biographer Anne Heller complimented the adaptation, calling it \\"handsomely illustrated\\".[146]\\r\\nThe novel was adapted in Urdu for the Pakistan Television Network in the 1970s, under the title Teesra Kinara. The serial starred Rahat Kazmi, who also wrote the adaptation.[148] Kazmi's wife, Sahira Kazmi, played Dominique.[149]\\r\\nThe Dutch theater company Toneelgroep Amsterdam presented an adaptation for the stage (in Dutch) at the Holland Festival in June 2014. The company's artistic director Ivo van Hove wrote and directed the adaptation. Ramsey Nasr starred as Howard Roark, with Halina Reijn as Dominique Francon.[150] After its debut the production went on tour, appearing in Barcelona, Spain, in early July 2014[151] and at the Festival d'Avignon in France later that month.[152] The play appeared at the Odon-Thatre de l'Europe in Paris in November 2016.[153] The four-hour production used video projections to show close-ups of the actors and Roark's drawings, as well as backgrounds of the New York skyline.[152][154] The Festival d'Avignon production received several positive notices, including reviews from the French newspapers La Croix,[154] Les chos,[155] and Le Monde,[156] as well as from the English newspaper The Guardian, whose reviewer described it as \\"electrifying theatre\\".[157] The French magazine Tlrama gave the Avignon production a negative review, calling the source material inferior and complaining about the use of video screens on the set,[158] while another French magazine, La Terrasse, complimented the staging and acting of the Odon production.[153]","input":"Who authored the famous novel the fountain head?"},{"output":"Sonny Perdue","context":"The United States Secretary of Agriculture is the head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The enterprise was a result of the efforts of Senator George W. Norris of Nebraska. TVA was envisioned not only as a provider, but also as a regional economic development agency that would use federal experts and electricity to more quickly modernize the region's economy and society.\\r\\n\\r\\nTVA's service area covers most of Tennessee, portions of Alabama, Mississippi, and Kentucky, and small slices of Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. It was the first large regional planning agency of the federal government and remains the largest.  Under the leadership of David Lilienthal (\\"Mr. TVA\\"), the TVA became a model for America's efforts to help modernize agrarian societies in the developing world.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Tennessee Valley Authority Act (ch. 32, Pub.L. 73ÿ17, 48?Stat.?58, enacted May?18, 1933, codified as amended at 16 U.S.C.??831, et seq.), creating the TVA.\\r\\nDuring the 1920s and the Great Depression years, Americans began to support the idea of public ownership of utilities, particularly hydroelectric power facilities. The concept of government-owned generation facilities selling to publicly owned distribution utilities was controversial and remains so today.[2]  Many believed privately owned power companies were charging too much for power, did not employ fair operating practices, and were subject to abuse by their owners (utility holding companies), at the expense of consumers. During his presidential campaign, Roosevelt claimed that private utilities had \\"selfish purposes\\" and said, \\"Never shall the federal government part with its sovereignty or with its control of its power resources while I'm president of the United States.\\" By forming utility holding companies, the private sector controlled 94 percent of generation by 1921, essentially unregulated.  (This gave rise to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (P.U.H.C.A.)). Many private companies in the Tennessee Valley were bought by the federal government. Others shut down, unable to compete with the T.V.A. Government regulations were also passed to prevent competition with T.V.A.\\r\\n\\r\\nT.V.A. was one of the first federal hydropower agencies, and today most of the nation's major hydropower systems are federally managed. Other attempts to create T.V.A.-like regional agencies have failed, such as a proposed Columbia Valley Authority for the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegional power consumers may benefit from lower-cost electricity supplied from T.V.A.'s network of 29 power-producing hydropower facilities. Supporters of TVA, though, note that the agency's management of the Tennessee River system without appropriated federal funding saves federal taxpayers millions of dollars annually. Opponents, such as Dean Russell in The TVA Idea, in addition to condemning the project as being socialist, argued that TVA created a \\"hidden loss\\" by preventing the creation of \\"factories and jobs that would have come into existence if the government had allowed the taxpayers to spend their money as they wished.\\" Defenders note that TVA is overwhelmingly popular in Tennessee among conservatives and liberals alike, as Barry Goldwater discovered in 1964, when he proposed selling the agency.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of the United States ruled TVA to be constitutional in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288 (1936).[4] The Court noted that regulating commerce among the states includes regulation of streams and that controlling floods is required for keeping streams navigable; it also upheld the constitutionality of the TVA under the War Powers Clause, seeing its activities as a means of assuring the electric supply for the manufacture of munitions in the event of war.[5] The argument before the court was that electricity generation was a by-product of navigation and flood control and therefore could be considered constitutional.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1920s, a major battle erupted over building an electric power system in the Tennessee Valley, based on the World War I  federal dam at Muscle Shoals, Alabama.  It would generate electricity and produce fertilizer.[2]  Senator George Norris of Nebraska blocked a proposal from Henry Ford in 1920 to use the dam to modernize the valley. Norris deeply distrusted privately owned utility companies. He did get Congress to pass the Muscle Shoals Bill, but it was vetoed as socialistic by President Herbert Hoover in 1931. The idea behind the Muscle Shoals Bill in 1933 became a core part of the New Deal's  TVA.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nEven by Depression standards, the Tennessee Valley was economically dismal in 1933. Thirty percent of the population was affected by malaria, and the average income was only $639 per year, with some families surviving on as little as $100 per year.  Much of the land had been farmed too hard for too long, eroding and depleting the soil. Crop yields had fallen along with farm incomes. The best timber had been cut, with another 10% of forests being burnt each year.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nTVA was designed to modernize the region, using experts and electricity to combat human and economic problems.[7] TVA developed fertilizers, taught farmers ways to improve crop yields and helped replant forests, control forest fires, and improve habitat for fish and wildlife. The most dramatic change in Valley life came from TVA-generated electricity.  Electric lights and modern home appliances made life easier and farms more productive.  Electricity also drew industries into the region, providing desperately needed jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe development of the dams displaced more than 15,000 families. This created anti-TVA sentiment in some rural communities.[citation needed]  Many local landowners were suspicious of government agencies, but TVA successfully introduced new agricultural methods into traditional farming communities by blending in and finding local champions.\\r\\n\\r\\nTennessee farmers would often reject advice from TVA officials, so the officials had to find leaders in the communities and convince them that crop rotation and the judicious application of fertilizers could restore soil fertility.  Once they had convinced the leaders, the rest followed.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt its inception, TVA was based in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, but later moved its headquarters to Knoxville, Tennessee, where they remain today. At one point, TVA's headquarters were housed in the Old Federal Customs House at the corner of Clinch Avenue and Market Street. The building is now a museum.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Authority hired many area unemployed to conduct conservation, economic development, and social programs, such as a library service that operated for the surrounding area. The professional staff headquarters was composed of experts from outside the region. The workers were categorized by the usual racial and gender lines of the day. TVA hired a few African Americans for janitorial or other low-level positions. TVA recognized labor unions; its skilled and semi-skilled blue collar employees were unionized, a breakthrough in an area known for corporations hostile to miners' and textile workers' unions. Women were excluded from construction work. TVA's cheap electricity attracted textile mills to the area, and they hired mostly women as workers.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, the U.S. needed greater aluminum supplies to build airplanes. Aluminum plants required huge amounts of electricity. To provide the power, TVA engaged in one of the largest hydropower construction programs ever undertaken in the U.S. By early in 1942, when the effort reached its peak, 12 hydroelectric plants and one steam plant were under construction at the same time, and design and construction employment reached a total of 28,000. The largest project of this period was the Fontana Dam. After negotiations led by Vice-President Harry Truman (\\"I want aluminum. I don't care if I get it from Alcoa or Al Capone\\"[citation needed]), TVA purchased the land from Nantahala Power and Light, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alcoa, and built Fontana Dam.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government originally intended the electricity generated from Fontana to be used by Alcoa factories.[citation needed] By the time the dam generated power in early 1945, the electricity was directed to another purpose in addition to aluminum manufacturing, as TVA also provided much of the electricity needed for uranium enrichment at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as required for the Manhattan Project and the making of the atomic bomb.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the war, TVA had completed a 650-mile (1050-kilometer) navigation channel the length of the Tennessee River and had become the nation's largest electricity supplier.\\r\\nEven so, the demand for electricity was outstripping TVA's capacity to produce power from hydroelectric dams.  Political interference kept TVA from securing additional federal appropriations to build coal-fired plants, so it sought the authority to issue bonds.[citation needed]  Congress passed legislation in 1959 to make the TVA power system self-financing, and from that point on it would pay its own way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1960s were years of unprecedented economic growth in the Tennessee Valley. Electric rates were among the nation's lowest and stayed low as TVA brought larger, more efficient generating units into service. Expecting the Valley's electric power needs to continue to grow, TVA began building nuclear reactors as a new source of cheap power. During this decade (and the 1970s), TVA was engaged in what was up to that time its most controversial project ÿ the Tellico Dam Project.[citation needed] The project was initially conceived in the 1940s but not completed until 1979.\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant changes occurred in the economy of the Tennessee Valley and the nation, prompted by an international oil embargo in 1973 and accelerating fuel costs later in the decade.\\r\\nThe average cost of electricity in the Tennessee Valley increased fivefold from the early 1970s to the early 1980s. TVA canceled the construction of 12 nuclear power plants in the 1980s.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1970s saw the last and most controversial of the TVA's large dam-reservoir projects, Tellico Dam. The Tellico Dam project was initially delayed because of concern over the snail darter. A lawsuit was filed under the Endangered Species Act and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of protecting the snail darter in Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarvin T. Runyon became chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority in January 1988. He claimed to reduce management layers, cut overhead costs by more than 30%, and achieved cumulative savings and efficiency improvements of $1.8 billion. He said he revitalized the nuclear program and instituted a rate freeze that continued for ten years.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the electric-utility industry moved toward restructuring and deregulation, TVA began preparing for competition.\\r\\nIt cut operating costs by nearly $950 million a year, reduced its workforce by more than half, increased the generating capacity of its plants, stopped building nuclear plants, and developed a plan to meet the energy needs of the Tennessee Valley through the year 2020.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, TVA began work to restart a previously mothballed nuclear reactor at Browns Ferry Unit 1, which was completed in May 2007.  In 2005, the TVA announced its intention to construct an Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor at its Bellefonte site in Alabama (filing the necessary applications in November 2007), and in 2007 announced plans to complete the unfinished Unit 2 at Watts Bar.  (TVA is the owner and operator of the Browns Ferry, Sequoyah, and Watts Bar nuclear power plants.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, TVA implemented recommendations from the Reservoir Operations Study (ROS) in how it operates the Tennessee River system (the nation's fifth largest).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 22, 2008, an earthen dike at TVA's Kingston Fossil Plant broke, spreading one billion gallons of wet coal ash across 300 acres (1.2?km2) of land and into the tributaries of the Tennessee River.[11]  While TVA's culture at its fossil fuel plants was not the cause of the Kingston Spill, the culture contributed to the spill, as was noted in the TVA Office of the Inspector General's report, Inspection 2008-12283-02, Review of the Kingston Fossil Plant Ash Spill Cause Study and Observations About Ash Management.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, TVA signed 20-year power purchase agreements with Maryland-based CVP Renewable Energy Co. and Chicago-based Invenergy Wind LLC for electricity generated by wind farms.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2013, TVA carries $25 billion in debt, near the $30 billion debt limit imposed by Congress.[14][15] TVA must retire at least 18 of its 59 coal-fired units by 2017, and install scrubbers in several others or convert them to make them cleaner at a cost of $25 billion over the next 10-years according to the Obama Administration's proposed 2013ÿ2014 budget. The budget also says that \\"reducing or eliminating the federal government's role in programs such as TVA, which have achieved their original objectives and no longer require federal participation, can help put the nation on a sustainable fiscal path\\" which could mean future privatization for TVA.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nTVA's power mix as of 2012 is 10 coal-powered plants, 29 hydroelectric dams, three nuclear power plants (with seven operating reactors), nine simple cycle natural gas combustion turbine plants, and five combined cycle gas plants.\\r\\nTVA is the largest public power utility in the United States and one of the largest producers of electricity in the country.[citation needed] It acts as a regional grid reliability coordinator. In 2012 coal generation was about 32% of total, nuclear 34%, hydro 9%, and (owned) gas 11%. TVA currently purchases from external power producers about 15% of the power it sells. Purchased power is from natural gas combined cycles, coal, wind, and other renewables. The cost of Purchased Power is part of the \\"Fuel Cost Adjustment\\" (FCA) charge that is separate from the TVA Rate. Watts Bar reactor produces tritium as a byproduct for the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration, which requires tritium for nuclear weapons (for \\"boosted\\" fission primaries and for fusion secondaries).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLagoon Creek Combined Cycle Plant (commercial operation September 2010) was the first combined cycle generating plant in Tennessee.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, TVA set out to build 17 nuclear reactors but finished only five.[10]  On August 6, 1981 the Tennessee Valley Authority Board voted to defer the Phipps Bend plant, as well as to slow down construction on all other projects.[16]  Only seven reactors have been built to date, but together these nuclear power plants produce about 30 percent of the TVA's energy.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nTVA also assists ALCOA's Tapoco/APGI in regulating several facilities, including the Calderwood, Cheoah, Chilhowee, and Santeetlah dams.\\r\\n\\r\\nTVA operates several small-scale facilities that generate electricity from renewable sources other than hydropower. These include:[19][20][21][22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Buffalo Mountain in Oliver Springs, Tennessee, TVA operates three wind turbines with a combined generation capacity of 2 MW and purchases the output of 15 additional wind turbines owned by Invenergy that have a combined capacity of 27 MW. As of 2013, the agency had purchased agreements from power generated from wind farms outside its service area:\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2010 agreement with Iberdrola Renewables provides a potential 300MW future supply from Streator-Cayuga Ridge Wind Farm, Livingston County, Illinois[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nBiogas from the Maxson wastewater treatment plant in Memphis is burned in Allen Fossil Plant, accounting for a generating capacity of 4 MW.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nTVA is one of the largest operators of electric transmission in the US with an approximately 16,000-mile (26,000?km) corridor of transmission (13,000 miles (21,000?km) of which is greater than 161kv).[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nTVA's headquarters are located in downtown Knoxville, with large administrative offices in Chattanooga (training/development; supplier relations; power generation and distribution) Nashville, Tennessee (economic development), and Muscle Shoals, Alabama.\\r\\n\\r\\nTVA has conveyed approximately 485,420 acres (1,964.4?km2) of property for recreation and preservation purposes including public parks; public access areas and roadside parks; wildlife refuges; national parks and forests; and other camps and recreation areas, which comprises approximately 759 different sites.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo qualify for a TVA Megasite certificate the qualifications are at least 1,000 acres, with interstate access, the potential for rail service, environmental impact study,  and utility service capable of serving a major manufacturing facility.  Seven TVA Megasites have been developed so far with capital investments of over $5 Billion.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nLocations:\\r\\n\\r\\nTVA was heralded by New Dealers and the New Deal Coalition not only as a successful economic development program for a depressed area but also as a democratic nation-building effort overseas because of its alleged grassroots inclusiveness as articulated by director David Lilienthal. The TVA was controversial in the 1930s. Historian Thomas McCraw concludes that Roosevelt \\"rescued the [power] industry from its own abuses\\" but \\"he might have done this much with a great deal less agitation and ill will\\".[30] New Dealers hoped to build numerous other TVAs around the country but were defeated by Wendell Willkie and the Conservative coalition in Congress. The valley authority model did not replace the limited-purpose water programs of the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. State-centered theorists hold that reformers are most likely to succeed during periods such as the New Deal era, when they are supported by a democratized polity and when they dominate Congress and the administration.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it has been shown that in river policy, the strength of opposing interest groups also mattered.[31] The TVA bill was passed in 1933 because reformers like Norris skillfully coordinated action at potential choke points and weakened the already disorganized opponents among the electric power industry lobbyists.[2] In 1936, however, after regrouping, opposing river lobbyists and conservative coalition congressmen took advantage of the New Dealers' spending mood by expanding the Army Corps' flood control program. They also helped defeat further valley authorities, the most promising of the New Deal water policy reforms.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n When Democrats after 1945 proclaimed the Tennessee Valley Authority as a model for countries in the developing world to follow, conservative critics charged it was a top-heavy, centralized, technocratic venture that displaced locals and did so in insensitive ways. Thus, when the program was used as the basis for modernization programs in various parts of the third world during the Cold War, such as in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, its failure brought a backlash of cynicism toward modernization programs that has persisted.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThen-movie star Ronald Reagan had moved to television as the host and a frequent performer for General Electric Theater during 1954. Reagan was later fired by General Electric in 1962 in response to his publicly referring to the TVA (TVA being a major customer for GE turbines) as one of the problems of \\"big government\\".[32] Some claim that Reagan was instead fired due to a criminal antitrust investigation involving him and the Screen Actors Guild.[33]  However, Reagan was only interviewed; nobody was actually charged with anything in the investigation.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1963, U.S. Senator and Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater was quoted in a Saturday Evening Post article by Stewart Alsop as saying, \\"You know, I think we ought to sell TVA.\\" He had called for the sale to private companies of particular parts of the Authority, including its fertilizer production and steam-generation facilities, because \\"it would be better operated and would be of more benefit for more people if it were part of private industry.\\"[36] Goldwater's Saturday Evening Post quotation was used against him in a TV ad by Doyle Dane Bernbach for President Lyndon Johnson's 1964 campaign, which depicted an auction taking place atop a dam. It was voiced over as follows: \\"In a Saturday Evening Post article dated August 31, 1963, Barry Goldwater said, 'You know, I think we ought to sell TVA.' This is a promise: President Johnson will not sell TVA. Vote for him on November 3. The stakes are too high for you to stay home.\\"[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1981 the TVA Board of Directors broke with previous tradition and took a hard line against white-collar unions during contract negotiations. As a result, a class action suit was filed in 1984 in U.S. court charging the agency with sex discrimination under Title?VII of the Civil Rights Act based on the large number of women in one of the pay grades negatively impacted by the new contract. An out-of-court settlement of the lawsuit was reached in 1987, in which TVA agreed to contract modifications and paid the group $5 million but admitted no wrongdoing.[citation needed]","input":"What were the goals of the tennessee valley authority?"},{"output":"Corporal Frank S. Scott","context":"Scott Air Force Base (IATA: BLV, ICAO: KBLV, FAA LID: BLV) is a United States Air Force base in St. Clair County, Illinois, near Belleville and O'Fallon, 25 miles East of downtown St. Louis. Scott Field was one of thirty-two Air Service training camps established after the United States entered World War I in April 1917.[1] It is part of the Air Mobility Command (AMC), and is also the headquarters of the U.S. Transportation Command, a Unified Combatant Command that coordinates transportation across all the services.\\r\\nThe base is operated by the 375th Air Mobility Wing (375 AMW) and is also home to the Air Force Reserve Command's 932d Airlift Wing (932 AW) and the Illinois Air National Guard's 126th Air Refueling Wing (126 ARW), the latter two units being operationally gained by AMC.\\r\\nThe base currently employs 13,000 people, 5,100 civilians with 5,500 active-duty Air Force, and an additional 2,400 Air National Guard and Reserve personnel. It was announced in June 2014 that two new cybersecurity squadrons will be added to the three currently on base.\\r\\nIts airfield is also used by civilian aircraft, with civilian operations at the base referring to the facility as MidAmerica St. Louis Airport. MidAmerica has operated as a Joint Use Airport since beginning operations in November 1997. Allegiant Air, the only commercial airline with scheduled flights at the airport, pulled out of the airport on January 3, 2009,[2][3] but resumed direct flights to Orlando in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScott Air Force Base is home to the headquarters of many major military organizations, including:\\r\\nThe 375th Air Mobility Wing is the host to more than 30 tenant units, including the Air Force Office of Special Investigations 3rd Field Investigations Region, the 932d Airlift Wing (Air Force Reserve Command), the 126th Air Refueling Wing (Illinois Air National Guard), and the 3rd Manpower Requirements Squadron (Air Force Manpower Agency).[4]\\r\\nDuring World War I, Secretary of War Newton Baker advocated an expanded role for aviation. Business and political leaders on both sides of the Mississippi River wanted the Midwest to be chosen as a site for one of the new \\"flying fields.\\" Aerial expert Albert Bond Lambert joined the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce and directors of the Greater Belleville Board of Trade to negotiate a lease agreement for nearly 624 acres of land.[4]\\r\\nAfter inspecting several sites, the U.S. War Department agreed to the lease June 14, 1917. Congress appropriated $10 million for its construction, and 2,000 laborers and carpenters were immediately put to work. The layout of Scott Field was typical of aviation fields built during World War I. Construction began in June 1917. The government gave the Unit Construction Company 60 days to erect approximately 60 buildings, lay a mile-long railroad spur, and to level off an airfield with a 1,600 foot landing circle. Construction was underway when the government announced, on July 20, 1917, that it would name the new field after Corporal Frank S. Scott, the first enlisted service member killed in an aviation crash.[4][5] Scott had died after an unexpected engine failure had brought down the aircraft that Lieutenant Lewis Rockwell had been giving him an orientation flight in at College Park, Maryland, on September 28, 1912.\\r\\nScott Field began as an aviation-training field for World War I pilots in August 1917 when the 11th and 21st Aero Squadrons from Kelly Field, Texas, arrived. Construction was completed in August, and the first flight from Scott Field occurred 2 September 1917. Flying instruction began 11 September 1917. Later the 85th and 86th Aero Squadrons arrived, and more than 300 pilots and many ground units were trained for service by the war's end in 1918.[4][5]\\r\\nTraining units assigned to Scott Field were:[6]\\r\\nBy 2 September, William Couch, a civilian flying instructor, and Scott Field Commander, Major George E. A. Reinburg, made the first flight from Scott Field in a Standard J-1 two-seater biplane. At least seven J-1s were already on Scott; by the time the first Curtiss JN-4D \\"Jenny\\" arrived. Operable from the front or rear seat, the 8-cylinder, 90- horsepower, Jenny would become the primary trainer used on Scott Field.[4] Everything moved fast in a wartime environment, including the dangerous act of learning to fly airplanes. A judgment error or weather shift could produce severe accidents in the fragile aircraft of the day, so it soon became apparent that Scott Field needed a medical air evacuation capability.[4]\\r\\nDetermined to improve the recovery of Scott's downed pilots, Captains Charles Bayless (post surgeon), Early Hoag (officer-in-charge of flying) and A.J. Etheridge (post engineer), along with Second Lieutenant Seth Thomas, designed two air ambulances, or hospital planesusing a configuration likely modeled after one in use at Gerstner Field, Louisiana. By the summer of 1918, Scott Field's engineering department had completed the rear cockpit modifications needed to convert two Jennies. Not long thereafter, on 24 August 1918, as aviator with a broken leg became Scott's first air evacuated patient.[4]\\r\\nAlso reassuring was the support Scott Field enjoyed from the local community. Plenty of curious sightseers came just to watch the construction or catch a glimpse of airplane activity, but many from the local community also gave morale support to their \\"Sammies\\" (Uncle Sam's boys). They hosted dances and receptions, established a library branch on the field, and invited soldiers into their homes for Thanksgiving dinners. Likewise, Scott Field hosted sporting events with their community neighbors and, on 17 August 1918, they invited the public to attend a Field Meet and Flight ExhibitionScott's first Air Show.[4]\\r\\nFlying was discontinued at Scott Field after the war and the base population dropped. The War Department purchased Scott Field in 1919 for $119, 285.84[5]\\r\\nScott Field's future became uncertain after the 11 November 1918 armistice with Germany and the end of World War I. Large scale demobilization closed many U.S. airfields. Scott's remaining units were organized into a Flying School Detachment, and the field itself was designated as a storage site for demobilized equipment. Welcome news came early in 1919, with the War Department's announcement of its decision to purchase Scott Field, a decision influenced by Scott's central location and exceptional purchase price of $119,285.84. This gave Scott a promise of a future; however, it still lacked a mission.[5]\\r\\nScott was transformed into a lighter-than-air (LTA) station in 1921, with the transfer of the Army Balloon and Airship School from Brooks Field, Texas. Lighter-than-air ships were used at Scott Field to research the capabilities of aerial photography, meteorology and conduct altitude experiments. The most notable addition was the new airship hangar. Constructed between September 1921 and January 1923, it was three blocks long, nearly one block wide and 15 stories high. One report commented that 100,000 mennearly the entire U.S. Army in 1923could have stood in formation inside it. Scott's hangar was second in size only to the naval station hangar in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the largest one in the world at the time.[5]\\r\\nA couple of highlights of Scott's LTA era (1921ÿ1937) include the 74-mph speed record for dirigibles, set by Scott Field's TC-1 in 1923, and the American free balloon altitude record of 28,510 feet, set in 1927, by Captain Hawthorne C. Gray. Captain Gray would have set a 42,470-feet world record later that same year had he survived that flight.[5]\\r\\nIn the late 1920s, emphasis shifted from airships to balloons. In 1929, the 12th Airship Company was inactivated and replaced the next day by the 1st Balloon Company. Airplanes began to dominate activities at Scott Field by the mid-1930s, and a series of airship mishaps led the Chief of the Army Air Corps to recommend an end to LTA activities in May 1937, and the following month Scott's LTA-era came to an abrupt end.[4][5]\\r\\nScott Field's central location was advantageous when it was considered for the relocation site of the General Headquarters Air Force (GHQAF), which managed the combat arm of the U.S. Army. Scott Field grew from 628 acres in 1938 to 1,882 acres in 1939. Most of the frame World War I and lighter-than-air constructions were torn downonly a few, such as the 9th Airstrip Squadron headquarters/barracks building, a brick theater and nine sets of brick non-commissioned officers' quarters at the south end of the field were saved.[4][5]\\r\\nNew housing, industrial and administrative buildings were completed by May 1939. The expansion program continued into 1940 with the construction of 21 more buildings, including a 200-man barracks, a 300,000-gallon elevated water tank, a 43-bed hospital, Hangar No. 1 and a General Headquarters Air Force office.[4][5]\\r\\nScott Field, as it existed at the end of the 1940 expansion program, is listed as the Scott Field Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.\\r\\nWith the outbreak of World War II, the GHQAF move to Scott was cancelled. Instead, Scott Field reverted to its former role as a training installation. On 1 June 1939, one of Scott's Balloon Groups was redesignated as a headquarters unit of the Scott Field Branch of the Army Air Corps Technical Schools. Subsequently, various technical schools moved to Scott. Its communications training era began in September 1940 with the opening of the Radio School.[4]\\r\\nAfter September 1940, the primary wartime mission of Scott was to train skilled radio operator/maintainers; to produce, as the Radio School's slogan proclaimed, \\"the best damned radio operators in the world!\\" Scott's graduates flew in aircraft and operated command and control communications in every Theater of the War, and were often referred to as the \\"Eyes and Ears of the Army Air Forces.\\" By the end of World War II, Scott's Radio Schoolbecoming something of a \\"Communications University of the Army Air Forces\\", where it expanded during the war to fill about 46 large school buildings on base. It was from this course that many specialized radio and communications courses evolved, and had graduated 77,370 radio operator/mechanics. While all had been important to the nation's victory, two of the schools better known graduates were Medal of Honor recipient Technical Sergeant Forrest Lee Vosler, and the future first Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, Paul Airey.[4]\\r\\nThough the Radio School was the primary World War II-era mission, it was not intended to be Scott's only mission. The Air Corps had also planned for Scott to become a major air terminal due to its centralized location in the United States. In 1940, a $1 million project began to construct four mile-long concrete runways. Though not fully completed until November 1942, the portions that were complete provided a capability to give advanced flying school graduates instruction in instrument and night flying, navigation, photography, and administrative flights. By late 1943, the Radio School students were in the air as well, practicing code transmission under actual flight conditions. Unfortunately, airfield operations had to be sharply curtailed in May 1944, after an accidental tool-spark set fire to Hangar 1Scott's only hangar. Repairs were not completed until May 1945.[4]\\r\\nThe U.S. Air Force became a separate service on 17 September 1947, and on 13 January 1948, Scott Field was re-designated as Scott Air Force Base and the 3310th Technical Training Wing assumed host responsibility from the 3505th Army Air Forces Base Unit. In 1948, Scott's Radio School was re-organized, with the radio operator and control tower courses relocated to Keesler AFB, Mississippi. In addition, the fixed wire courses at Scott went to Francis E. Warren AFB, Wyoming, so that Scott had room to expand its radio mechanic school.[7]\\r\\nIn early 1949, Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson initiated a series of economic measures throughout the armed forces. His purpose was to effect greater utilization of the assets assigned to all services. As a result of these actions, a number of bases transferred between major commands, schools moved, and other bases closed. Because of these DOD-directed initiatives, Headquarters USAF decided to move Air Training Command (ATC) headquarters from Barksdale AFB, Louisiana to Scott AFB, effective 17 October 1949. The new ATC headquarters established in Building P-3, which was originally designed to be Headquarters, General Headquarters Air Force (GHQ Air Force). Air Training Command moved its headquarters into the building on 17 October 1949. At Scott, ATC absorbed the functions of its previous three subordinate headquartersFlying, Technical, and Indoctrination Divisions.[7]\\r\\nThroughout the USAF transition, Scott's primary mission remained technical training; however Scott's aeromedical evacuation mission continued to grow. By the end of 1950, Douglas C-54 Skymasters were bringing 200 patients a week to Scott.[4]\\r\\nIn 1957, Military Air Transport Service (MATS) moved to Scott AFB to help facilitate management of its east and west coast units, and between July and October 1957, ATC transferred its headquarters to Randolph AFB, Texas. During the changeover some technical training continued, however, by February 1959, the few remaining technical courses left Scott for other bases. As part of the air mobility transition, ATC's 3310th Technical Training Wing was re-designated on 1 October 1957, as the 1405th Air Base Wing, a MATS organization. With the transition complete, Scott's new primary mission became air mobility.[4]\\r\\nWith the re-alignment to MATS, Aeromedical evacuation continued to grow and in 1964, Scott's host wing was re-designated as the 1405th Aeromedical Transport Wing. Increasing importance placed on airlift and the decision by the Navy to set up its own transport command led to the Military Air Transport Service being re-designated as Military Airlift Command (MAC) in 1966. Associated with this reorganization, the 1405th was discontinued and its mission and resources were absorbed by the newly activated AFCON 375th Aeromedical Airlift Wing. The addition of a fleet of C-9A Nightingales in 1968 further expanded the 375th's aeromedical mission. In 1973, Scott's Patient Airlift Center coordinated 61 aeromedical missions to bring 357 former Vietnam War Prisoners of War back to the United States. In June 1973, the 1400th Air Base Wing inactivated, the 375th Air Base Group (today the 375th Mission Support Group) reactivated, and host wing responsibilities reverted to the 375th Aeromedical Airlift Wing. By 1975, the 375th gained responsibility for the worldwide aeromedical evacuation system.[4]\\r\\nThe 375th gained another mission in 1978; Operational Support Airlift. Scott received its first T-39A Sabreliner in 1962. After 1978, the 375th was managing a dispersed continental fleet of 104 Sabreliners flying a combined 92,000 hours a year. The CT-39As were phased out in 1984, the same year the first Gates C-21A Learjets arrived at Scott.[4]\\r\\nAs the 375th reorganized, it transitioned to a Military Airlift Wing in 1990 and an Airlift Wing in 1991. In 1992, Military Airlift Command inactivated and its personnel and assets were combined with others to form Air Mobility Command (AMC). Later in the 1990s, two new partners joined Scott's team, MidAmerica Airport and the Illinois Air National Guard 126th Air Refueling Wing. A 1987 Federal Aviation Administration authorization, followed by a 1991 joint use agreement resulted in the 1998 opening of the new MidAmerica Airport. Similarly, the 1992 realignment of refueling units to AMC, plus the planned MidAmerica construction, led to a 1995 Base Realignment and Closure committee recommendation to relocate the 126th Air Refueling Wing to Scott AFB.[4]\\r\\nAMC's 15th and 21st Air Forces became Expeditionary Mobility Task Forces in 2003. They, along with all AMC wings and independent groups realigned to a newly activated 18th Air Force. The new ready mobility operations capability would speed AMC's support for contingencies and humanitarian missions. In 2003, age, noise, maintenance and lack of demand led to the retirement of the C-9A Nightingale. In the years that followed, the C-21A fleet was reorganized and reduced. These events caused a flying mission restructuring that today has Scott using a diverse mix of assigned and non-assigned aircraft to support aeromedical airlift, operational support airlift and air refueling missions.[4]\\r\\nThe 375th Airlift Wing officially became the 375th Air Mobility Wing on 30 September 2009. The Total Force Integration effort called for the creation of an associate unit consisting of active duty KC-135 pilots, boom operators, and maintainers who worked side by side with their counterparts in the 126th Air Refueling Wing. The 375th Operation Group staff had administrative responsibilities for 135 aircrew members and maintainers under the 906th Air Refueling Squadron, a unit that moved from Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota. The 126th Air Refueling Wing maintained the operational direction and control of the mission execution responsibility of these Airmen. Scott AFB served as one of six locations in Air Mobility Command and one of 10 throughout the Air Force where TFI efforts unfolded.[4]\\r\\nOn June 25, 2014, the base was awarded two new cybersecurity squadrons that will add over 300 personnel, and an additional $16 million infrastructure improvements. The base presently has three cyber units.[8]\\r\\nThe residential part of the base is a census-designated place; the population was 3,612 at the 2010 census.[10]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the base has a total area of 9.7?km2 (3.7?sq?mi), all land.\\r\\nAs of the census[11] of 2000, there were 2,707 people, 682 households, and 662 families residing on the base. The population density was 721 inhabitants per square mile (278/km2). There were 715 housing units at an average density of 190.4 inhabitants per square mile (73.5/km2). The racial makeup of the base was 78.9% White, 13.5% Black or African American, 0.3% Native American, 3.0% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 1.8% from other races, and 2.4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.1% of the population.\\r\\nThere were 682 households out of which 78.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 90.5% were married couples living together, 4.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 2.9% were non-families. Of all households, 2.8% were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.83, and the average family size was 3.90.\\r\\nOn the base the age distribution of the population shows 44.7% under the age of 18, 7.8% ages 18 to 24, 40.6% ages 25 to 44, 6.6% ages 45 to 64, and 0.3% were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females there were 100.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 99.2 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household on the base was $51,290, and the median income for a family was $52,258. Males had a median income of $39,289 versus $24,674 for females. The per capita income for the base was $15,421. About 0.9% of families and 1.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 1.9% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.\\r\\nShilohÿScott (St. Louis MetroLink) rail station links Scott Air Force Base with direct trains to downtown St. Louis on MetroLink's Red Line.

Aquinas explained, \\"Consequently fruit is mentioned there in the singular, on account of its being generically one, though divided into many species which are spoken of as so many fruits.\\"[5] Augustine's commentary on Galatians 5:25-26, says, \\"the Apostle had no intention of teaching us how many [either works of the flesh, or fruits of the Spirit] there are; but to show how the former should be avoided, and the latter sought after.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAgape (love) denotes an undefeatable benevolence and unconquerable goodwill that always seeks the highest in others, no matter their behavior. It is a  love that gives freely without asking anything in return, and does not consider the worth of its object.  Agape is more a love by choice than philos, which is love by chance; and it refers to the will rather than the emotion.  Agape describes the unconditional love God has for the world. Paul describes love in 1 Corinthians 13:4ÿ8:[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nLove is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Strong's Greek Lexicon, the word ?? [G26] (Transliteration: agap) means love, i.e. affection or benevolence; specially (plural) a love-feast:(feast of) charity(-ably), dear, love.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOutline of Biblical Usage:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greek word ?? (agap) occurs 117 times in 106 verses in the Greek concordance of the NASB.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe joy referred to here is deeper than mere happiness, is rooted in God and comes from Him. Since it comes from God, it is more serene and stable than worldly happiness, which is merely emotional and lasts only for a time. \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Strong's Greek Lexicon, the Greek word listed in the verse is ϫ? (G5479), meaning 'joy', 'gladness', or 'a source of joy'. The Greek ϫ? (chara) occurs 59 times in 57 verses in the Greek concordance of the NASB.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoy (Noun and Verb), Joyfulness, Joyfully, Joyous:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"joy, delight\\" (akin to chairo, \\"to rejoice\\"), is found frequently in Matthew and Luke, and especially in John, once in Mark (Mar 4:16, RV, \\"joy,\\" AV, \\"gladness\\"); it is absent from 1 Cor. (though the verb is used three times), but is frequent in 2 Cor., where the noun is used five times (for 2Cr 7:4, RV, see Note below), and the verb eight times, suggestive of the Apostle's relief in comparison with the circumstances of the 1st Epistle; in Col 1:11, AV, \\"joyfulness,\\" RV, \\"joy.\\" The word is sometimes used, by metonymy, of the occasion or cause of \\"joy,\\" Luk 2:10 (lit., \\"I announce to you a great joy\\"); in 2Cr 1:15, in some mss., for charis, \\"benefit;\\" Phl 4:1, where the readers are called the Apostle's \\"joy;\\" so 1Th 2:19, 20; Hbr 12:2, of the object of Christ's \\"joy;\\" Jam 1:2, where it is connected with falling into trials; perhaps also in Mat 25:21, 23, where some regard it as signifying, concretely, the circumstances attending cooperation in the authority of the Lord.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: In Hbr 12:11, \\"joyous\\" represents the phrase meta, \\"with,\\" followed by chara, lit., \\"with joy.\\" So in Hbr 10:34, \\"joyfully;\\" in 2Cr 7:4 the noun is used with the Middle Voice of huperperisseuo, \\"to abound more exceedingly,\\" and translated \\"(I overflow) with joy,\\" RV (AV, \\"I am exceeding joyful\\").[9] \\r\\nThe Greek word ?? (Strong's G1515)(eirn)(transliteration: i-ray'-nay), probably derived from a primary verb ? er (to join), means peace (literally or figuratively); by implication, prosperity:one, peace, quietness, rest, + set at one again. [10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \\"peace\\" comes from the Greek word eirene, the Greek equivalent for the Hebrew word shalom, which expresses the idea of wholeness, completeness, or tranquility in the soul that is unaffected by the outward circumstances or pressures.  The word eirene strongly suggests the rule of order in place of chaos.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greek ?? (eirn) occurs 92 times in 86 verses in the Greek concordance of the KJV. The KJV translates Strong's G1515 in the following manner: peace (89x), one (1x), rest (1x), quietness (1x). The outline of Biblical usage is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nJesus is described as the Prince of Peace, who brings peace to the hearts of those who desire it.  He says in John 14:27:[12] \\"Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid\\". In Matthew 5:9 he says, \\"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally the Greek world applied this word to a man who could avenge himself but did not. This word is often used in the Greek Scriptures in reference to God and his attitude to man.[14] Exodus 34:6 describes the Lord as \\"slow to anger and rich in kindness and fidelity.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPatience, which in some translations is \\"longsuffering\\" or \\"endurance\\", is defined in Strong's by two Greek words, makrothumia and hupomone.\\r\\nThe first, pronounced (mak-roth-oo-mee-ah) comes from makros, \\"long\\", and thumos, \\"temper\\".  The word denotes lenience, forbearance, fortitude, patient endurance, longsuffering.  Also included in makrothumia is the ability to endure persecution and ill-treatment.  It describes a person who has the power to exercise revenge but instead exercises restraint. (Strong's #3115)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter, hupomone, (hoop-om-on-ay) is translated \\"endurance\\": Constancy, perseverance, continuance, bearing up, steadfastness, holding out, patient endurance.  The word combines hupo, \\"under\\", and mone, \\"to remain\\".  It describes the capacity to continue to bear up under difficult circumstances, not with a passive complacency, but with a hopeful fortitude that actively resists weariness and defeat, (Strong's #5281) with hupomone (Greek ??) being further understood as that which would be \\"as opposed to cowardice or despondency\\"[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"With lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love\\".[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Greek, old wine was called \\"chrestos\\" which meant that it was mellow or smooth.[14] Christ used this word in Matthew 11:30, \\"For my yoke is easy, and my burden light.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, kindness is acting for the good of people regardless of what they do, properly, \\"useable, i.e. well-fit for use (for what is really needed); kindness that is also serviceable\\".[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStrong's #5544: Kindness is goodness in action, sweetness of disposition, gentleness in dealing with others, benevolence, kindness, affability.  The word describes the ability to act for the welfare of those taxing your patience.  The Holy Spirit removes abrasive qualities from the character of one under His control. (emphasis added)\\r\\nThe word kindness comes from the Greek word chrestotes (khray-stot-ace), which meant to show kindness or to be friendly to others and often depicted rulers, governors, or people who were kind, mild, and benevolent to their subjects.  Anyone who demonstrated this quality of chrestotes was considered to be compassionate, considerate, sympathetic, humane, kind, or gentle.  The apostle Paul uses this word to depict God's incomprehensible kindness for people who are unsaved (see Romans 11:22;[18] Ephesians 2:7;[19] Titus 3:4[20]).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne scholar has noted that when the word chrestotes is applied to interpersonal relationships, it conveys the idea of being adaptable to others.  Rather than harshly require everyone else to adapt to his own needs and desires, when  chrestotes is working in a believer, he seeks to become adaptable to the needs of those who are around him.  (Sparkling Gems from the Greek, Rick Renner)\\r\\nKindness is doing something and not expecting anything in return. Kindness is respect and helping others without waiting for someone to help one back. It implies kindness no matter what. We should live \\"in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love; in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left\\".[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nPopular English Bibles (e.g. NIV, NASB, NLT) translate the single Greek word chrestotes into two English words: kindness and goodness. \\"Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power\\".[22] \\"For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth\\",[23] with agathosune being \\"found only in Biblical and ecclesiastical writings, uprightness of heart and life\\"[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe root of pistis[25] (\\"faith\\") is peith?[26] that is to persuade or be persuaded which supplies the core-meaning of faith as being \\"divine persuasion\\", received from God, and never generated by man. It is defined as the following: objectively, trustworthy; subjectively, trustful:believe(-ing, -r), faithful(-ly), sure, true.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greek 򿼶?? (pistos) occurs 67 times in 62 verses in the Greek concordance of the KJV: faithful (53x), believe (6x), believing (2x), true (2x), faithfully (1x), believer (1x), sure (1x).\\r\\n\\r\\nOutline of Biblical Usage[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth\\".[29] \\"I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith\\".[Eph 3:16-17]\\r\\nThe writer of the Letter to the Hebrews describes it this way: \\"Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God\\".[30]\\r\\nGentleness, in the Greek, prautes, commonly known as meekness, which is \\"a divinely-balanced virtue that can only operate through faith (cf. [1 Tim 6:11]; [2 Tim 2:22-25]).[31]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n. The New Spirit Filled Life Bible defines gentleness as \\r\\n\\"a disposition that is even-tempered, tranquil, balanced in spirit, unpretentious, and that has the passions under control.

It was created by Paul Frommer, a professor at the USC Marshall School of Business with a doctorate in linguistics. Na?vi was designed to fit James Cameron's conception of what the language should sound like in the film, to be realistically learnable by the fictional human characters of the film, and to be pronounceable by the actors, but to not closely resemble any single human language.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the film was released in 2009, Na?vi had a growing vocabulary of about a thousand words, but understanding of its grammar was limited to the language's creator.[1] However, this has changed subsequently as Frommer has expanded the lexicon to more than 2200 words[2] and has published the grammar, thus making Na?vi a relatively complete, learnable and serviceable language.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Na?vi language has its origins in James Cameron's early work on Avatar.  In 2005, while the film was still in scriptment form, Cameron felt it needed a complete, consistent language for the alien characters to speak.  He had written approximately thirty words for this alien language but wanted a linguist to create the language in full.  His production company, Lightstorm Entertainment, contacted the linguistics department at the University of Southern California seeking someone who would be interested in creating such a language. Edward Finegan, a professor of linguistics at USC, thought that the project would appeal to Paul Frommer, with whom he had co-authored a linguistics textbook, and so forwarded Lightstorm's inquiry on to him.  Frommer and Cameron met to discuss the director's vision for the language and its use in the film; at the end of the meeting, Cameron shook Frommer's hand and said \\"Welcome aboard.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on Cameron's initial list of words, which had a \\"Polynesian flavor\\" according to Frommer,[3] the linguist developed three different sets of meaningless words and phrases that conveyed a sense of what an alien language might sound like: one using contrasting tones, one using varying vowel lengths, and one using ejective consonants.  Of the three, Cameron liked the sound of the ejectives most.  His choice established the phonology that Frommer would use in developing the rest of the Na?vi language ÿ morphology, syntax, and an initial vocabulary ÿ a task that took six months.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Na?vi vocabulary was created by Frommer as needed for the script.  By the time casting for Avatar began, the language was sufficiently developed that actors were required to read and pronounce Na?vi dialogue during auditions.  During shooting Frommer worked with the cast, helping them understand their Na?vi dialogue and advising them on their Na?vi pronunciation, stress, and intonation.  Actors would often make mistakes in speaking Na?vi.  In some cases, those mistakes were plausibly explained as ones their human characters would make; in other cases, the mistakes were incorporated into the language.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrommer expanded the vocabulary further in May 2009 when he worked on the Avatar video game, which required Na?vi words that had not been needed for the film script and thus had not yet been invented. Frommer also translated into Na?vi four sets of song lyrics that had been written by Cameron in English, and he helped vocalists with their pronunciation during the recording of James Horner's Avatar score.  At the time of the film's release on December 18, 2009, the Na?vi vocabulary consisted of approximately 1000 words.\\r\\n\\r\\nWork on the Na?vi language has continued even after the film's release.  Frommer is working on a compendium which he plans to deliver to Fox in the near future.[4]  He hopes that the language will \\"have a life of its own,\\"[5] and thinks it would be \\"wonderful\\" if the language developed a following.[3] Apparently, it has developed a following, as is evident through the increasing learner community of the language.[6] The community's Lexical Expansion Project, together with Frommer, has expanded the lexicon by more than 50 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrommer also maintains a blog, Naviteri, where he regularly posts additions to the lexicon and clarifications on grammar. Na?viteri has been the source of the vast majority of Na?vi growth independent of Frommer's contract with 20th Century Fox.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Na?vi language was developed under three significant constraints.  First, Cameron wanted the language to sound alien but pleasant and appealing to audiences.  Second, since the storyline included humans who have learned to speak the language, it had to be a language that humans could plausibly learn to speak.  And finally, the actors would have to be able to pronounce their Na?vi dialogue without unreasonable difficulty.  The language in its final form contains several elements which are uncommon in human languages, such as verbal conjugation using infixes.  All Na?vi linguistic elements are found in human languages, but the combination is unique.\\r\\n\\r\\nNa?vi lacks voiced plosives like [b] [d] [], but has the ejective consonants [p?] [t?] [k?], which are spelled px, tx, kx. It also has the syllabic consonants ll and rr.  There are seven vowels, a ? e i  o u. Although all the sounds were designed to be pronounceable by the human actors of the film, there are unusual consonant clusters, as in fngap [f?ap] \\"metal\\".[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nNa?vi syllables may be as simple as a single vowel, or as complex as skxawng \\"moron\\" or fngap above (both CCVC).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fictional language Na?vi of Pandora is unwritten. However, the actual (studio) language is written in the Latin script for the actors of Avatar. Some words include: zst \\"year\\", fpeio \\"ceremonial challenge\\", awve \\"first\\" (aw \\"one\\"), mui? \\"fair\\", tireaioang \\"spirit animal\\", tskxe \\"rock\\", kllpxltu \\"territory\\", uniltrantokx \\"avatar\\" (dream-walk-body).[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are seven monophthong vowels:\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are additionally four diphthongs: aw [aw], ew [w], ay [aj], ey [j], and two syllabic consonants: ll [l?] and rr [r?], which mostly behave as vowels.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that the e is open-mid while the o is close-mid, and that there is no *oy. The rr is strongly trilled, and the ll is \\"light\\", never a \\"dark\\" (velarized) *[??].\\r\\n\\r\\nThese vowels may occur in sequences, as in the Polynesian languages, Swahili, and Japanese. Each vowel counts as a syllable, so that tsaleioae has six syllables, [tsa.l?.i.o.a.e], and meoauniaea has eight, [m?.o.a.u.ni.a.?.a].\\r\\n\\r\\nNa?vi does not have vowel length or tone, but it does have contrastive stress: t~te \\"person\\", tut \\"female person\\". Although stress may move with derivation, as here, it is not affected by inflection (case on nouns, tense on verbs, etc.). So, for example, the verb lu (\\"to be\\") has stress on its only vowel, the u, and no matter what else happens to it, the stress stays on that vowel: lol~ \\"was\\" (l?ol?u), lol?ng~ \\"was (ugh!)\\" (l?ol???ng?u), etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are twenty consonants. There are two Latin transcriptions: one that more closely approaches the ideal of one letter per phoneme, with the c and g for [ts] and [?] (the values they have in much of Eastern Europe and Polynesia, respectively), and a modified transcription used for the actors, with the digraphs ts and ng used for those sounds. In both transcriptions, the ejective consonants are written with digraphs in x, a convention that appears to have no external inspiration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fricatives and the affricate, f v ts s z h, are restricted to the onset of a syllable; the others may occur at the beginning or at the end (though w y in final position are considered parts of diphthongs, as they only occur as ay ey aw ew and may be followed by another final consonant, as in skxawng \\"moron\\"). However, in addition to appearing before vowels, f ts s may form consonant clusters with any of the unrestricted consonants (the plosives and liquids/glides) apart from , making for 39 clusters. Other sequences occur across syllable boundaries, such as Na?vi [na?.vi] and ikran [ik.?an] \\"banshee\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plosives p t k are tenuis, as in Spanish or French. In final position, they have no audible release, as in Indonesian and other languages of Southeast Asia. The r is flapped, as in Spanish and Indonesian; it sounds a bit like the tt or dd in the American pronunciation of the words latter / ladder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plosives undergo lenition after certain prefixes and prepositions. The ejective consonants px tx kx become the corresponding plosives p t k; the plosives and affricate p t ts k become the corresponding fricatives f s h; and the glottal stop  disappears entirely. For example, the plural form of po \\"s/he\\" is ayfo \\"they\\", with the p weakening into an f after the prefix ay-.\\r\\n\\r\\nLenition has its own significance when the plural prefix can optionally be omitted. In the above example, ayfo can be shortened to fo. Similarly, the plural of tsmukan \\"brother\\" can be smukan (from aysmukan).\\r\\n\\r\\nNa?vi has free word order. For example, the English \\"I see you\\" (a common greeting in Na?vi), can be as follows in Na?vi:\\r\\n\\r\\nOel ngati kameie\\r\\n\\r\\nNgati oel kameie\\r\\n\\r\\nOel kameie ngati\\r\\n\\r\\nAll forms of \\"I see you\\" in Na?vi are completely correct. As sentences become more complex though, some words, like adjectives and negatives, will have to stay in a more or less fixed position in the sentence, depending on what the adjective or negative is describing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Today is a good day\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFtrr lu sltsana trr\\r\\n\\r\\nSltsana trr ftrr lu\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this case, the adjective sltsan(a) (good) will need to stay with the noun trr (day), therefore limiting the sentence to fewer combinations on the construction of the sentence, but as long as it follows or precedes the noun, the sentence is fine. By putting the attributive a before the adjective, the adjective can be put after the noun:\\r\\n\\r\\nFtrr lu trr asltsan\\r\\n\\r\\nMore information about this can be found in the Adjectives section.\\r\\n\\r\\nNouns in Na?vi show greater number distinctions than those in most human languages do: besides singular and plural, they not only have special dual forms for two of an item (eyes, hands, lovers, etc.), which are common in human language (English has a remnant in \\"both\\"), but also trial forms for three of an item, which on Earth are only found with pronouns. Gender is only occasionally (and optionally) marked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plural prefix is ay+, and the dual is me+. Both trigger lenition (indicated by the \\"+\\" signs rather than the hyphens that usually mark prefix boundaries). In nouns which undergo lenition, the plural prefix may be dropped, so the plural of tokx \\"body\\" is either aysokx or just sokx.\\r\\n\\r\\nMasculine and feminine nouns may be distinguished by suffix. There are no articles (words for \\"a\\" or \\"the\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nNouns are declined for case in a tripartite system, which is rare among human languages. In a tripartite system, there are distinct forms for the object of a clause, as in \\"he kicks the ball\\"; the agent of a transitive clause which has such an object, as in \\"he kicks the ball\\"; and the subject of an intransitive clause, which does not have an object, as in \\"he runs\\". An object is marked with the accusative suffix -ti, and an agent with the ergative suffix -l, while an intransitive subject has no case suffix. The use of such case forms leaves the word order of Na?vi largely free.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two other casesgenitive in -y?, dative in -ruas well as a topic marker -ri. The latter is used to introduce the topic of the clause, and is somewhat equivalent to Japanese wa and the much less common English \\"as for\\". It preempts the case of the noun: that is, when a noun is made topical, usually at the beginning of the clause, it takes the -ri suffix rather than the case suffix one would expect from its grammatical role. For example, in,\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides case, the role of a noun in a clause may be indicated with adpositions. Any adposition may occur as either as a preposition before the noun, or as an enclitic after the noun, a greater degree of freedom than English allows. For example, \\"with you\\" may be either hu nga or ngahu. When used as enclitics, they are much like the numerous cases found in Hungarian and Finnish. When used as prepositions, more along the lines of what English does, certain of them trigger lenition. One of the leniting prepositions is m \\"in\\", as in m sokx \\"in the body\\". This may cause some ambiguity with short plurals: m sokx could also be short for m aysokx \\"in the bodies\\".[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nNa?vi pronouns encode clusivity. That is, there are different words for \\"we\\" depending on whether the speaker is including his/her addressee or not. There are also special forms for \\"the two of us\\" (with or without the addressee), \\"the three of us\\", etc. They do not inflect for gender; although it is possible to distinguish \\"he\\" from \\"she\\", the distinction is optional.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deferential forms of \\"I\\" and \\"you\\" are ohe and ngenga. Possessive forms include ngey? \\"your\\" and pey? \\"her/his\\". \\"He\\" and \\"she\\" can optionally be differentiated as poan and po.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grammatical distinctions made by nouns are also made by pronouns.\\r\\n\\r\\nNa?vi adjectives are uninflectedthat is, they do not agree with the noun they modifyand may occur either before or after the noun. They are marked by a syllable a, which is attached on the side closest to the noun. For example, \\"a long river\\" can be expressed either as,\\r\\n\\r\\nor as,\\r\\n\\r\\nThe free word order holds for all attributives: Genitives (possessives) and relative clauses can also either precede or follow the noun they modify. The latter especially allows for great freedom of expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attributive affix a- is only used when an adjective modifies a noun. Predicative adjectives instead take the \\"be\\" verb lu:\\r\\n\\r\\nVerbs are conjugated for tense and aspect, but not for person. That is, they record distinctions like \\"I am, I was, I would\\", but not like \\"I am, we are, s/he is\\". Conjugation relies exclusively on infixes, which are like suffixes but go inside the verb. \\"To hunt\\", for example, is taron, but \\"hunted\\" is t?ol?aron, with the infix ?ol?.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two positions for infixes: after the onset (optional consonant(s)) of the penultimate syllable, and after the onset of the final syllable. Because many Navi verbs have two syllables, these commonly occur on the first and last syllable. In monosyllabic words like lu \\"be\\", they both appear after the initial onset, keeping their relative order.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first infix position is taken by infixes for tense, aspect, mood, or combinations thereof; also appearing in this position are participle, reflexive, and causative forms, the latter two of which may co-occur with a tense/aspect/mood infix by preceding it. Tenses are past, recent past, present (unmarked), future, and immediate future; aspects are perfective (completed or contained) and imperfective (ongoing or uncontained). The aspectual forms are not found in English but are somewhat like the distinction between 'having done' and 'was doing'.\\r\\n\\r\\nTense and aspect need not be marked when they can be understood by context or elsewhere in the sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second infix position is taken by infixes for affect (speaker attitude, whether positive or negative) and for evidentiality (uncertainty or indirect knowledge). For example, in the greeting in the section on nouns, Oel ngati kameie \\"I See you\\", the verb kame \\"to See\\" is inflected positively as kam?ei?e to indicate the pleasure the speaker has in meeting you. In the subsequent sentence, Oeri ontu teya l?ngu \\"My nose is full (of his smell)\\", however, the phrase teya lu \\"is full\\" is inflected pejoratively as teya l??ng?u to indicate the speaker's distaste at the experience. Examples with both infix positions filled:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Na?vi language currently has over 2,000 words. These include a few English loan words such as kunsp \\"gunship\\". The published lexicon, including the odd inflectional form, is available online at https://eanaeltu.learnnavi.org/dicts/NaviDictionary.pdf. Additionally, the community at learnnavi.org is working with Dr. Frommer to further develop the language. Na?vi is a very modular language and the total number of usable words far exceeds the 2,000 dictionary words. For example: rol \\"to sing\\" L trusol \\"the act of singing\\" or ngop \\"to create\\" L ngopyu \\"creator\\". Workarounds using existing words also abound in the Na?vi corpus, such as eltu lefngap \\"metallic brain\\" for \\"computer\\" and palulukantsyp \\"little thanator\\" for \\"cat\\".","input":"What language is spoken in the movie avatar?"},{"output":"sleep terror","context":"Night terror, also known as sleep terror, is a sleep disorder, causing feelings of terror or dread, and typically occurs during the first hours of stage 3-4 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.[1] Sleep terrors begin in children between the ages of 3 and 12, and usually stop during adolescence. In adults, they most commonly occur between the ages of 20 to 30. Though the frequency and severity vary between individuals, the episodes can occur in intervals of days or weeks, but can also occur over consecutive nights or multiple times in one night.[2] This has created a situation in which any type of nocturnal attack or nightmare may be confused with and reported as a night terror.[3]\\r\\nNight terrors tend to happen during periods of arousal from delta sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep.[4][3] Delta sleep occurs most often during the first half of a sleep cycle, which indicates that people with more delta sleep activity are more prone to night terrors. However, they can also occur during daytime naps.[2] Night terrors can often be mistaken for confusional arousal.[4]\\r\\nWhile nightmares (bad dreams that cause feelings of horror or fear) are relatively common during childhood, night terrors occur less frequently.[5] Sleep terror episodes are estimated to occur in 1ÿ6% of children, and in less than 1% of adults.[6] Night terrors have been known since ancient times, although it was impossible to differentiate them from nightmares until rapid eye movement was discovered.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe universal feature of night terrors is inconsolability, very similar to that of a panic attack.[7] During night terror bouts, people are usually described as \\"bolting upright\\" with their eyes wide open and a look of fear and panic on their faces. They will often scream. Furthermore, they will usually sweat, exhibit rapid breathing, and have a rapid heart rate (autonomic signs). In some cases, individuals are likely to have even more elaborate motor activity, such as a thrashing of limbswhich may include punching, swinging, or fleeing motions. There is a sense that the individuals are trying to protect themselves and/or escape from a possible threat of bodily injury.[2] Although people may seem to be awake during a night terror, they will appear confused, be inconsolable and/or unresponsive to attempts to communicate with them, and may not recognize others familiar to them. Occasionally, when a person with a night terror is awakened, they will lash out at the one awakening them, which can be dangerous to that individual. Most people who experience this do not remember the incident the next day.[4] Sleepwalking is also common during night terror bouts,[3][8] as sleepwalking and night terrors are different manifestations of the same parasomnia.[3]\\r\\nDuring lab tests, subjects are known to have very high voltages of electroencephalography (EEG) delta activity, an increase in muscle tone, and a doubled increase in heart rate, if not more. Brain activities during a typical episode show theta and alpha activity when using an EEG. It is also common to see abrupt arousal from NREM sleep that does not progress into a full episode of a night terror. These episodes can include tachycardia. Night terrors are also associated with intense autonomic discharge of tachypnea, flushing, diaphoresis, and mydriasis[7] ÿ that is, unconscious or involuntary rapid breathing, reddening of the skin, profuse sweating, and dilation of the pupils.\\r\\nIn children with night terrors, there is no increased occurrence of psychiatric diagnoses.[9] However, in adults who suffer from night terrors there is a close association with psychopathology or mental disorders. There may be an increased occurrence of night terrorsparticularly among those suffering or having suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is also likely that some personality disorders may occur in individuals with night terrors, such as dependent, schizoid, and borderline personality disorders.[9] There have been some symptoms of depression and anxiety that have increased in individuals that have suffered from frequent night terrors. Low blood sugar is associated with both pediatric and adult night terrors.[2][10] A study of adults with thalamic lesions of the brain and brainstem have been occasionally associated with night terrors.[11] Night terrors are closely linked to sleepwalking and frontal lobe epilepsy.[12]\\r\\nNight terrors typically occur in children between the ages of three and twelve years, with a peak onset in children aged three and a half years old.[13] An estimated 1ÿ6% of children experience night terrors. Boys and girls of all ethnic backgrounds are affected equally.[13] In half of all cases.[13] In children younger than three and a half years old, peak frequency of night terrors is at least one episode per week. Among older children, peak frequency of night terrors is one or two episodes per month. The children will most likely have no recollection of the episode the next day. Pediatric evaluation may be sought to exclude the possibility that the night terrors are caused by seizure disorders or breathing problems.[13] Most children will outgrow sleep terrors.[14]\\r\\nNight terrors in adults have been reported in all age ranges.[15] Though the symptoms of night terrors in adolescents and adults are similar, the cause, prognosis and treatment are qualitatively different. These night terrors can occur each night if the sufferer does not eat a proper diet, get the appropriate amount or quality of sleep (e.g. sleep apnea), is enduring stressful events, or if he or she remains untreated. Adult night terrors are much less common, and often respond to treatments to rectify causes of poor quality or quantity of sleep. Night terrors are classified as a mental and behavioral disorder in the ICD.[16] A study done about night terrors in adults showed that other psychiatric symptoms were prevalent in most patients experiencing night terrors hinting at the comorbidity of the two.[17] There is some evidence of a link between night terrors and hypoglycemia.[18]\\r\\nWhen a night terror happens, it is typical for a person to wake up screaming and kicking and to be able to recognize what he or she is saying. The person may even run out of the house (more common among adults) which can then lead to violent actions.[19] It has been found that some adults who have been on a long-term intrathecal clonidine therapy show side effects of night terrors, such as feelings of terror early in the sleep cycle.[20] This is due to the possible alteration of cervical/brain clonidine concentration.[15] In adults, night terrors can be symptomatic of neurological disease and can be further investigated through an MRI procedure.[21]\\r\\nThere is some evidence that a predisposition to night terrors and other parasomnias may be congenital. Individuals frequently report that past family members have had either episodes of sleep terrors or sleepwalking. In some studies, a ten-fold increase in the prevalence of night terrors in first-degree biological relatives has been observedhowever, the exact link to inheritance is not known.[2] Familial aggregation has been found suggesting that there is an autosomal mode of inheritance.[17] In addition, some laboratory findings suggest that sleep deprivation and having a fever can increase the likelihood of a night terror episode occurring.[6] Other contributing factors include nocturnal asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, and central nervous system medications.[17] Special consideration must be used when the subject suffers from narcolepsy, as there may be a link. There have been no findings that show a cultural difference between manifestations of night terrors, though it is thought that the significance and cause of night terrors differ within cultures. Evidence suggests that nightmares are more common among women than men.[22]\\r\\nAlso, older children and adults provide highly detailed and descriptive images associated with their sleep terrors compared to younger children, who either cannot recall or only vaguely remember. Sleep terrors in children are also more likely to occur in males than females; in adults, the ratio between sexes is equal.[2] A longitudinal study examined twins, both identical and fraternal, and found that a significantly higher concordance rate of night terror was found in identical twins than in fraternal.[17][23]\\r\\nThough the symptoms of night terrors in adolescents and adults are similar, their causes, prognoses, and treatments are qualitatively different. There is some evidence that suggests that night terrors can occur if the sufferer does not eat a proper diet, does not get the appropriate amount or quality of sleep (e.g., because of sleep apnea), or is enduring stressful events. Adults who have experienced sexual abuse are more likely to receive a diagnosis of sleep disorders, including night terrors.[24] Overall, though, adult night terrors are much less common and often respond best to treatments that rectify causes of poor quality or quantity of sleep.\\r\\nHypoglycemia caused by an Insulinoma is also a possible cause as the body uses adrenaline to elevate blood-glucose levels.[25]\\r\\nThe DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for sleep terror disorder requires:[6]\\r\\nIn most children, night terrors eventually subside and do not need to be treated. It may be helpful to reassure the child and their family that they will outgrow this disorder.[26]\\r\\nPsychotherapy or counseling can be helpful in many cases. There is some evidence to suggest that night terrors can result from lack of sleep or poor sleeping habits. In these cases, it can be helpful to improve the amount and quality of sleep which the child is getting.[26] If this is not enough, benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) or tricyclic antidepressants may be used; however, medication is only recommended in extreme cases.[27]\\r\\nA small study of paroxetine found some benefit.[28] Another small trial found benefit with L -5-hydroxytryptophan (L -5-HTP).[29]","input":"What is the medical term for night terrors?"},{"output":"William Morris Davis","context":"William Morris Davis (February 12, 1850 ÿ February 5, 1934) was an American geographer, geologist, geomorphologist, and meteorologist, often called the \\"father of American geography\\".\\r\\nHe was born into a Quaker family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, son of Edward M. Davis and Maria Mott Davis (a daughter of the women's advocate Lucretia Mott). He graduated from Harvard University in 1869 and received a Master of Engineering in the following year.\\r\\nDavis initially worked in C܇rdoba, Argentina as a meteorologist for three years and after working as an assistant to Nathaniel Shaler, he became an instructor in geology at Harvard, in 1879. The same year he married Ellen B. Warner from Springfield, Massachusetts. While Davis never completed his PhD, he was appointed to his first full professorship in 1890 and remained in academia and teaching throughout his life.\\r\\nDavis' most influential scientific contribution was the \\"geographical cycle\\", first defined in his 1889 article, The Rivers and Valleys of Pennsylvania,[1] which was a model of how rivers erode uplifted land to base level. His cycle of erosion suggests that (larger) rivers have three main stages of development, generally divided into youthful, mature and old-age stages.[7] Each stage has distinct landforms and other properties associated with them, which can occur along the length of a river's upper, middle, and lower course.\\r\\nThough the cycle of erosion was a crucial early contribution to the development of geomorphology, many of Davis' theories regarding landscape evolution, sometimes termed 'Davisian geomorphology', were heavily criticized by later geomorphologists. When Davis retired from Harvard in 1911, the study of landscape evolution was nearly monopolized by his theories. It was characteristic of Davis to react violently and disdainfully to criticism, particularly to the German criticism in the 1920s headed by Walther Penck; it was also his characteristic to choose to attack the most vulnerable points of that criticism.[8] Since that time, with a less dogmatic approach and greater knowledge, some authors note that Penck's and Davis' ideas have become more compatible and even complementary since the advent of modern tectonic theory. They claim that Davis' ideas are more applicable near active margins where tectonics are \\"cataclysmic\\", and Penck's ideas fit better in models of passive margins and continental platforms.[9]\\r\\nHe was a founder of the Association of American Geographers in 1904, and heavily involved with the National Geographic Society in its early years, writing a number of articles for the magazine. Davis retired from Harvard in 1911. He was awarded the Patron's Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1919. [10]\\r\\nAfter his first wife died, Davis married Mary M.

Shortly after they are caught in a police chase where the narrator drives his truck through a cornfield to escape, much to Becky's delight.

It followed the Bank of North America, the nation's first de facto central bank.\\r\\nEstablishment of the Bank of the United States was part of a three-part expansion of federal fiscal and monetary power, along with a federal mint and excise taxes, championed by Alexander Hamilton, first Secretary of the Treasury. Hamilton believed a national bank was necessary to stabilize and improve the nation's credit, and to improve handling of the financial business of the United States government under the newly enacted Constitution.\\r\\nThe First Bank building, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, within Independence National Historical Park, was completed in 1797, and is a National Historic Landmark for its historic and architectural significance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1791, The First Bank of the United States was one of the four major financial innovations proposed and supported by Hamilton, first Secretary of the Treasury. In addition to the national bank, the other measures were assumption of the state war debts by the U.S. Government, establishment of a mint and imposition of a federal excise tax. The goals of Hamilton's three measures were to:[2]\\r\\nIn simpler words, Hamilton's four goals were to\\r\\nAccording to the plan put before the first session of the First Congress in 1790, Hamilton proposed establishing the initial funding for the First Bank of the United States through the sale of $10 million in stock of which the United States government would purchase the first $2 million in shares. Hamilton, foreseeing the objection that this could not be done since the U.S. government did not have $2 million, proposed that the government make the stock purchase using money lent to it by the bank; the loan to be paid back in ten equal annual installments. The remaining $8 million of stock would be available to the public, both in the United States and overseas. The chief requirement of these non-government purchases was that one-quarter of the purchase price had to be paid in gold or silver; the remaining balance could be paid in bonds, acceptable scrip, etc.[6]\\r\\nBy continuously insisting on these conditions, the First Bank of the United States might technically possess $500,000 in \\"real\\" money that it could, and would, use as security to make loans up to its capitalized limit of $10 million.[7] However, unlike the Bank of England, the primary function of the bank would be credit issued to government and private interests, for internal improvements and other economic development, per Hamilton's system of Public Credit. The business it would be involved in on behalf of the federal governmenta depository for collected taxes, making short term loans to the government to cover real or potential temporary income gaps, serving as a holding site for both incoming and outgoing monieswas considered highly important but still secondary in nature.[8]\\r\\nThere were other, nonnegotiable conditions for the establishment of the First Bank of the United States. Among these were:[citation needed]\\r\\nTo ensure that the government could meet both the current and future demands of its governmental accounts, an additional source of funding was required, \\"for interest payments on the assumed state debts would begin to fall due at the end of 1791...those payments would require $788,333 annually, and... an additional $38,291 was needed to cover deficiencies in the funds that had been appropriated for existing commitments.\\"[10] To achieve this, Hamilton repeated a suggestion he had made nearly a year beforeincrease the duty on imported spirits, plus raise the excise tax on domestically distilled whiskey and other liquors. Local opposition to the tax led to the Whiskey Rebellion.\\r\\nHamilton's bank proposal faced widespread resistance from opponents of increased federal power. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and James Madison led the opposition, which claimed that the bank was unconstitutional, and that it benefited merchants and investors at the expense of the majority of the population.\\r\\nLike most of the Southern members of Congress,[13] Jefferson and Madison also opposed a second of the three proposals of Hamilton: establishing an official government Mint. They believed this centralization of power away from local banks was dangerous to a sound monetary system and was mostly to the benefit of business interests in the commercial north, not southern agricultural interests, arguing that the right to own property would be infringed by these proposals. Furthermore, they contended that the creation of such a bank violated the Constitution, which specifically stated that congress was to regulate weights and measures and issue coined money (rather than mint and bills of credit).[14]\\r\\nThe first part of the bill, the concept and establishment of a national mint, met with no real objection, and sailed through; it was assumed the second and third part (the bank and an excise tax to finance it) would likewise glide through, and in their own way they did: The House version of the bill, despite some heated objections, easily passed. The Senate version of the bill did likewise, with considerably fewer, and milder, objections. It was when \\"the two bills changed houses, complications set in. In the Senate, Hamilton's supporters objected to the House's alteration of the plans for the excise tax.\\"[7]\\r\\nThe establishment of the bank also raised early questions of constitutionality in the new government. Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, argued that the bank was an effective means to utilize the authorized powers of the government implied under the law of the Constitution. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson argued that the bank violated traditional property laws and that its relevance to constitutionally authorized powers was weak. Another argument came from James Madison, who believed Congress had not received the power to incorporate a bank, or any other governmental agency. His argument rested primarily on the Tenth Amendment: that all powers not endowed to Congress are retained by the States (or the people). Additionally, his belief was that if the Constitution's writers had wanted Congress to have such power, they would have made it explicit. The decision would ultimately fall on President George Washington, following his deliberate investigation of the cabinet members' opinions.[15]\\r\\nGeorge Washington initially declared that he was hesitant to sign the \\"bank bill\\" into law. Washington asked for the written advice and supporting reasons from all his cabinet membersmost particularly from Hamilton. Attorney General Edmund Randolph from Virginia felt that the bill was unconstitutional. Jefferson, also from Virginia, agreed that Hamilton's proposal was against both the spirit and letter of the Constitution. Hamilton, who, unlike his fellow cabinet members, came from New York, quickly responded to those who claimed incorporation of the bank unconstitutional. While Hamilton's rebuttals were many and varied, chief among them were these two:\\r\\nOn February 25, 1791, convinced that the constitution authorized the measure,[15] Washington signed the \\"bank bill\\" into law.\\r\\nOn March 19, 1791 Washington appointed three Commissioners for the taking of subscriptions for this new bank: Thomas Willing, David Rittenhouse, and Samuel Howell.[17]\\r\\nAfter Hamilton left office in 1795, the new Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott, Jr. informed Congress that, due to the existing state of government finances, more money was needed. This could be achieved either by selling the government's shares of stock in the bank, or by raising taxes. Wolcott advised the first choice. Congress quickly agreed. Hamilton objected, believing that the dividends on that stock had been inviolably pledged for the support of the sinking fund to retire the debt. Hamilton tried to organize opposition to the measure, but was unsuccessful.\\r\\nIn 1811, the U.S. Senate tied on a vote to renew the bank's charter. Vice President George Clinton broke the tie and voted against renewal. The bank's charter thus expired in 1811.\\r\\nIn 1816, the bank was succeeded by the Second Bank of the United States.\\r\\nAfter the charter for the First Bank of the United States expired in 1811, Stephen Girard purchased most of its stock as well as the building and its furnishings on South Third Street in Philadelphia and opened his own bank, later known as Girard Bank. Girard hired George Simpson, the cashier of the First Bank of the United States, as cashier of the new bank, and with seven other employees, opened for business on May 18, 1812. He allowed the Trustees of the First Bank of the United States to use some offices and space in the vaults to continue the process of winding down the affairs of the closed bank at a very nominal rent.[18]\\r\\nOver its early history the bank was known as Girards Bank,[19] or as Girard Bank [20] or also as Stephen Girards Bank or even the Bank of Stephen Girard. [19] Girard was the sole proprietor of his bank, and thus avoided the Pennsylvania state law which prohibited an unincorporated association of persons from establishing a bank, and which required a charter from the legislature for a banking corporation.[21]\\r\\nThe First Bank of the United States was established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, while the city served as the national capital, from 1790 to 1800. In the eighteenth century, Philadelphia was one of the largest cities in the English-speaking world. The bank began operations in Carpenters' Hall in 1791, some 200 feet from its permanent home.\\r\\nDesign of the bank building is credited to Samuel Blodgett, Superintendent of Buildings for the new capital in Washington, DC.,[23] although it has also been attributed to James Hoban.[24][25] It was completed in 1795.[26]\\r\\nThe First Bank of the United States has received various designations as a historic building. It was included in Independence National Historical Park when the park was formed in 1956. The building's architecture was studied by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1958.[24] With the rest of Independence National Historical Park, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966, and the bank was then declared a National Historic Landmark on May 4, 1987. It is described in the landmark designation as an early masterpiece of monumental Classical Revival design.[27]\\r\\nUntil about 2000, the building housed offices for Independence National Historical Park. A proposal to have it house the collection of the Philadelphia Civil War Museum was abandoned when funding from the state of Pennsylvania was not forthcoming.[28] Future plans are for it to house the National Park Service archaeology lab, currently across the street in the old Visitor Center.","input":"When was the first bank established in the united states?"},{"output":"186,095","context":"San Sebastin (Spanish:?[san seas?tjan]) or Donostia (Basque:?[do?nos?tia])[3] is a coastal city and municipality located in the Basque Autonomous Community, Spain.

The capital city of Gipuzkoa, the municipality's population is 186,095 as of 2015,[4] with its metropolitan area reaching 436,500 in 2010.[5] Locals call themselves donostiarra (singular), both in Spanish[6] and Basque.\\r\\nThe main economic activities are commerce and tourism, and it is one of the most famous tourist destinations in Spain.[7] Despite the citys small size, events such as the San Sebastin International Film Festival have given it an international dimension. San Sebastin, along with Wroc?aw, Poland, was the European Capital of Culture in 2016.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of appearances, both the Basque form Donostia and the Spanish form San Sebastin have the same meaning of Saint Sebastian. The dona/done/doni element in Basque place-names signifies \\"saint\\" and is derived from Latin domine; the second part of Donostia contains a shortened form of the saint's name.[9] There are two hypotheses regarding the evolution of the Basque name: one says it was *Done Sebastine > Donasa(b)astiai > Donasastia > Donastia > Donostia,[10] the other one says it was *Done Sebastiane > *Done Sebastiae > *Done Sebastie > *Donesebastia > *Donasastia > *Donastia > Donostia.[11]\\r\\nThe city is in the north of the Basque Autonomous Community, on the southern coast of the Bay of Biscay. San Sebastin's picturesque shoreline makes it a popular beach resort. The seaside environment is enhanced by hilly surroundings that are easily accessible, i.e., Urgull (at the heart of the city by the seashore), romantic Mount Ulia extending east to Pasaia, Mount Adarra rising proud far on the south and Igeldo, overlooking the bay from the west.\\r\\nThe city sits at the mouth of the River Urumea, Donostia having been built to a large extent over the river's wetlands during the last two centuries. In fact, the city centre and the districts of Amara Berri and Riberas de Loiola lie on such terrain and the former bed of the river, diverted to its current canalized course in the first half of the 20th century.[12]\\r\\nSan Sebastin features an oceanic climate (K?ppen Cfb) with warm summers and cool winters. Like many cities with this climate, San Sebastin typically experiences cloudy or overcast conditions for the majority of the year, typically with some precipitation. The city averages roughly 1,650?mm (65?in) of precipitation annually, which is fairly evenly spread throughout the year. However, the city is somewhat drier and noticeably sunnier in the summer months, experiencing on average approximately 100?mm (3.94?in) of precipitation during those months. Average temperatures range from 8.9?C (48.0?F) in January to 21.5?C (70.7?F) in August.\\r\\nThe first evidence of human stationary presence in the current city is the settlement of Ametzaga?a, between South Intxaurrondo and Astigarraga. The unearthed remains, such as carved stone used as knives to cut animal skin, date from 24,000 to 22,000 BC. The open-air findings of the Upper Paleolithic have revealed that the settlers were hunters and Homo sapiens, besides pointing to a much colder climate at the time.[14]\\r\\nSan Sebastin is thought to have been in the territory of the Varduli in Roman times. 10?km (6?mi) east of the current city lay the Basque Roman town of Oiasso (Irun), which was for a long time wrongly identified with San Sebastin.\\r\\nAfter a long period of silence in evidence, in 1014 the monastery of St. Sebastin with its apple orchards (for cider), located in the term of Hernani, is donated to the Abbey of Leire by Sancho III of Pamplona. By 1181, the city is chartered (given fuero) by king Sancho VI of Pamplona on the site of Izurum, having jurisdiction over all the territory between the rivers Oria and Bidasoa.\\r\\nIn 1200, the city was conquered by Castile, whose king Alfonso VIII, confirmed its charter (fuero), but the Kingdom of Navarre was deprived of its main direct access out to the sea. Perhaps as soon as 1204 (or earlier), the city nucleus at the foot of Urgull started to be populated with Gascon-speaking colonizers from Bayonne and beyond, who left an important imprint in the city's identity in the centuries to come.[15]\\r\\nIn 1265, the use of the city as a seaport is granted to Navarre as part of a wedding pact. The large quantity of Gascons inhabiting the town favoured the development of trade with other European ports and Gascony. The city steered clear of the destructive War of the Bands in Gipuzkoa, the only town in doing so in that territory. In fact, the town only joined Gipuzkoa in 1459 after the war came to an end.[15] Up to the 16th century, Donostia remained mostly out of wars, but by the beginning of the 15th century, a line of walls of simple construction is attested encircling the town. The last chapter of the town in the Middle Ages was brought about by a fire that devastated Donostia in 1489. After burning to the ground, the town began a new renaissance by building up mainly with stone instead of bare timber.\\r\\nThe advent of the Modern Age brought a period of instability and war for the city. After the fall of Navarre, new state boundaries started to be drawn that left Donostia at the forefront of the Spanish border with France. New chunky and more sophisticated walls were erected and the town got involved in the wars engaged between Spain and France on the aftermath of the disappearance of the independent Kingdom of Navarre in 1521. Actually, the town provided critical naval help to the Spanish king on the frontier disputes that took place in Hondarribia, which earned the town the titles \\"Muy Noble y Muy Leal\\", recorded on its coat of arms. Moreover, the town took sides with the new emperor Charles V by sending a party to the Battle of Noain and providing help to the emperor against the Revolt of the Comuneros.\\r\\nAfter the conquest of the Iberian Navarre and the attachment of Donostia to Gipuzkoa, Gascons, who had played a leading role in the political and economic life of the town since its foundation, began to be excluded from influential public positions by means of a string of regional sentences upheld by royal decision (regional diets of Zestoa 1527, Hondarribia 1557, Bergara 1558, Tolosa 1604 and Deba 1662).[15] Meanwhile, the climate of war and disease left the town in a poor condition that drove many fishermen and traders to take to the sea as corsairs as a way of getting a living, most of the times under the auspices of the king Philip II of Spain, who benefited from the disruption caused to and wealth obtained from the French and Dutch trade ships.\\r\\nIn 1656, the city was used as the royal headquarters during the marriage of the Infanta to Louis XIV at Saint-Jean-de-Luz nearby. After a relatively peaceful 17th century, the town was besieged and taken over by the troops of the French Duke of Berwick up to 1721. However, San Sebastin was not spared by shelling in the French assault and many urban structures were reconstructed, e.g. a new opening in the middle of the town, the Plaza Berria (that was to become the current Konstituzio Plaza).\\r\\nIn 1728, the Compa?a Guipuzcoana de Caracas was founded and boosted commerce with the Americas. Thanks to the profit the company generated, the town underwent some urban reforms and improvements and the new Santa Maria Church was erected by subscription. This period of wealth and development was to last up to the end of 18th century.[16]:56/58\\r\\nIn 1808, Napoleonic forces captured San Sebastin in the Peninsular War. In 1813, after a siege of various weeks, on 28 August, during the night, a landing party from a British Royal Navy squadron captured Santa Clara Island, in the bay. Situated on a narrow promontory that jutted out into the sea between the waters of the Bay of Biscay and the broad estuary of the Urumea River, the town was hard to get at and well fortified ÿ \\"it was the strongest fortification I ever saw, Gibraltar excepted\\", wrote William Dent.[17] Three days later, on 31 August, British and Portuguese troops besieging San Sebastin assaulted the town. The relieving troops ransacked and burnt the city to the ground. Only the street at the foot of the hill (now called 31 August Street) remained.\\r\\nAfter the destructive events, the reconstruction of the city was decided in the same spot with an only slightly altered layout, since a modern octagonal draft project by the architect P.M. Ugartemendia was turned down and eventually M. Gogorza's blueprint was approved, while supervised and implemented by the former. This area, the Old Part, oozes neoclassical, austere and systematic style in its architectural construction. The Constitution Square was built in 1817 and the town hall (current library) between 1828 and 1832.[12]:100 Housing works were carried out gradually during various decades until they were achieved.\\r\\nThe liberal and bourgeois San Sebastin became capital of Gipuzkoa (at the expense of Tolosa) until 1823, when absolutists assailed the town again (only 200 inhabitants remained in town when the assaulting troops broke in), but it was made capital city again in 1854.[18] In 1833, British volunteers under Sir George de Lacy Evans defended the town against Carlist attack, and their fallen were buried at the \\"English Cemetery\\" on the hill Urgull.\\r\\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the local government was still ruled on the principle of nobility, while the inhabitants of foreign origin or descent had always been ubiquitous in the town, especially the traders. Although San Sebastin benefited greatly from the charts system established in the Southern Basque Country (foruak, with borders in the Ebro river and no duties for overseas goods), the town was at odds with the more traditional Gipuzkoa, even requesting the detachment from the province and the annexation to Navarre in 1841.\\r\\nIn 1863, the defensive walls of the town were demolished (their remains are visible in the underground car-park at the Boulevard) and an expansion of the town began in an attempt to escape the military function it had held before.[19] Works were appointed to Jose Goicoa and Ramon Cortazar, who modeled the new city according to an orthogonal shape much in an neoclassical Parisian style, and the former designed elegant buildings, like the Miramar Palace, or the Concha Promenade.[12]:145ÿ146 The city was chosen by the Spanish monarchy to spend the summer following the French example of the near Biarritz. Subsequently, the Spanish nobility and the diplomatic corps opened residences in the summer capital. As the \\"wave baths\\" at La Concha conflicted with shipbuilding activity, shipyards relocated to Pasaia, a near bay formerly part of San Sebastin.\\r\\nHowever, in 1875, war battered the town again and shelling over the city by Carlists caused acclaimed bertsolari and poet Bilintx to die in 1876.[18] As of 1885, King Alfonso XII of Spain's widow Maria Cristina spent her summer in Donostia on a yearly basis (took accommodation at the Miramar Palace), bringing along her retinue. In 1887, the Casino was erected, which eventually turned into the current city hall, and somewhat later the Regional Government's (Diputaci܇n's) building was completed in the Gipuzkoa Plaza following Jose Goicoa's design. Cultural life thrived on this period, giving rise to various typical events in the city, such as the Caldereros or the Tamborrada, and journalistic and literary productions both in Spanish and Basque.\\r\\nAfter much debate within the city over its vocation, either tourism or manufacturing, Donostia developed into a fully-fledged seaside resort, but some industry developed in the district of Antiguo and outskirts of the city. Following the outbreak of World War I, San Sebastin became an attracting focus for renowned international figures of culture and politics,[18] e.g. Mata Hari, Leon Trotsky, Maurice Ravel, Romanones, etc.\\r\\nVarious rationalist architectural landmarks, typically white or light toned, were erected and dotted the urban landscape in the 20s and 30s (La Equitativa, Nautico, building Easo, etc.). In 1924-1926, works to canalize the Urumea river were carried out on the southern tip of the city. However, after the city's Belle Epoque in the European war time, repression under Miguel Primo de Rivera's dictatorship didn't favour the city. In 1924, gambling was prohibited by the authoritarian regime, causing the Grand Casino and the Kursaal (1921) to struggle to survive.\\r\\nIn 1930, Spanish republican forces signed up the Pact of San Sebastin leading to the Second Spanish Republic. Unrest and repression did not stop with the new political regime, and large-scale industrial action was taken several times by the growing anarchist, communist and socialist unions. The 1936 military coup was initially defeated by resistance led by the Basque Nationalists,[20]:226 anarchists and communists, but later that year the province fell to Spanish Nationalist forces during the Northern Campaign.[21]:397 The occupation proved disastrous for the city dwellers: between 1936 and 1943, 485 people were executed as a result of pseudo-trials by the Spanish Nationalists (Requets and Falangists),[22]:431 including the mayor. Extrajudicial executions (paseos) by the rebel occupying military account for an estimate of over 600 individuals murdered in the area during the first months.[23]:431 Many children were evacuated to temporary safety in Bilbao, with the city draining on an exodus estimated at 40,000 to 50,000 inhabitants.\\r\\nIn the aftermath of war, the city was stricken by poverty, famine and repression, coupled with thriving smuggling. Many republican detainees were held at the Ondarreta prison in grim and humid conditions (building demolished in 1948) right at the beach with the same name. However, industry developed and paved the way for the urban expansion in the popular district Egia and eclectic styled Amara Berri, on the marshes and riverbed of the Urumea, at the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s.\\r\\nIn 1943, the seeds of the Basque language schools were being sown by Elvira Zipitria, who started to give instruction in Basque at her own house in the Old Part. In 1947, the Grand Casino was turned into the City Hall.[12]:95 A decade later, in 1953, businessmen from the city organised the first San Sebastin International Film Festival to stimulate the economic life and national and international profile of the city.\\r\\nThe massive immigration from various parts of Spain, spurred by growing industrial production, greatly increased population, in turn bringing about a quick and chaotic urban development on the outskirts of the city (Altza, Intxaurrondo, Herrera, Bidebieta, etc.), but social, cultural and political contradictions and inequities followed, so sparking dissatisfaction. A general climate of protest and street demonstrations ensued, driven by Basque nationalists (especially armed separatist organisation ETA) and underground unions, triggering in 1968 the first state of emergency in Gipuzkoa. Several more were imposed by the Francoist authorities in the run-up to the dictator's death in 1975.\\r\\nIn the middle of the shaky economic situation and real estate speculation, the iconic buildings Kursaal and Chofre bullring in Gros were demolished in 1973.[18] On the other hand, sculptor Eduardo Chillida's and architect Luis Pe?a Ganchegui's landmark The Comb of the Winds was built at the bay's western tip (1975ÿ1977). The 1970s to the mid-1980s were years of general urban and social decay marked by social and political unrest and violence.\\r\\nIn 1979, the first democratic municipal elections were held, won by the Basque Nationalist Party, who held office along with splinter party Eusko Alkartasuna (Basque Solidarity) until 1991. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party's Odon Elorza took over as mayor that year until 2011, when he was overthrown unexpectedly in elections by Juan Carlos Izagirre (Bildu).[18]\\r\\nAs of the 1990s, a major makeover of the city centre was undertaken aimed at enhancing and revamping the neoclassical and modernist side of San Sebastin's architecture. Other milestone works include the reshape and enlargement of the Zurriola beach and promenade and the inauguration of the Kursaal Palace cubes (1999),[18] or the new university campus and technological facilities in Ibaeta, the provision of a wide bike lane network, underground car-parks and significant public transport improvements. Districts of cutting-edge design have been erected, such as Ibaeta or Riberas de Loiola, while some important projects hang on the balance prompted by financial tensions.\\r\\nAs a result of Donostia's sprawling in all directions, first into the flatlands shaped by the river Urumea and later up the hills, new districts arose after the walls of the city were demolished in 1863. The first expansion of the old town stretched out to the river's mouth, on the old quarter called Zurriola (a name later given by Council decision to the sand area and the avenue across the river).[12]:13, 322\\r\\nThe orthogonal layout nowadays making up the city centre (the Cortazar development) was built up to 1914 (first phase finished) much in tune with a Parisian Haussmannian style. The arcades of the Buen Pastor square were fashioned after the ones of the Rue de Rivoli, with the Maria Cristina Bridge being inspired by the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine.[12]:257 The Estaci܇n del Norte train station standing right across the bridge was inaugurated in 1864 just after the arrival of the railway to San Sebastin, with its metallic roof being designed by Gustave Eiffel. Donostia's central bus station is located underground adjacent to the train station.[24]\\r\\nThe Parte Vieja (Old Town) is the traditional core area of the city, and was surrounded by walls up to 1863, when they were demolished so as to occupy the stretch of sand and land that connected the town to the mainland (a stretch of the walls still limits the Old Part on its exit to the port through the Portaletas gate). The Old Town is divided in two parishes relating to the Santa Maria and San Vicente churches, the inhabitants belonging to the former being dubbed traditionally joxemaritarrak, while those attached to the latter are referred to as koxkeroak. Historically, the koxkeroak up to the early 18th century were largely Gascon speaking inhabitants. Especially after the end of Franco's dictatorship, scores of bars sprang up all over the Old Part which are very popular with the youth and the tourists, although not as much with the local residents. Most current buildings trace back to the 19th century, erected thanks to the concerted effort and determination of the town dwellers after the 1813 destruction of the town by the allied Anglo-Portuguese troops.[16]:73ÿ75, 81ÿ89\\r\\nThere is a small fishing and recreation port, with two-floor picturesque houses lined under the front-wall of the mount Urgull. Yet these houses are relatively new, resulting from the demilitarization of the hill,[12]:218 sold to the city council by the Ministry of War in 1924.\\r\\nThis part stands at the west side of the city beyond the Miramar Palace. It is arguably the first population nucleus, even before the land at the foot of Urgull (Old Part) was settled. A monastery of San Sebastin el Antiguo ('the Old') is attested in documents at the time of the foundation (12th century).[12]:35 At the mid 19th century, industry developed (Cervezas El Le܇n, Suchard, Lizarriturry),[25] the nucleus coming to be populated by workers. Industry has since been replaced by services and the tourist sector. The Matia kalea provides the main axis for the district.\\r\\nOr Old Amara, named after the farmhouse Amara.[12]:30 It has eventually merged with the city centre to a large extent, since former Amara lay on the marshes at the left of the River Urumea. The core of this district is the Easo plaza, with the railway terminal of Euskotren closing the square at its south.\\r\\nThis city expansion to the south came about as of the 1940s, after the works to canalize the river were achieved.[12]:30ÿ31, 92 Nowadays the name Amara usually applies to this sector, the newer district having overshadowed the original nucleus both in size and population. The district harbours the main road entrance to the city. Facilities of many state run agencies were established here and presently Amara's buildings house many business offices. The district revolves around the axis of Avenida Sancho el Sabio and Avenida de Madrid.\\r\\nThe district is built on the sandy terrain across the river. The Gros or Zurriola surf beach by the river's mouth bears witness to that type of soil. In the 19th century, shanties and workshops started to dot the area, Tomas Gros being one of its main proprietors as well as providing the name for this part of the city.[12]:148ÿ149 The area held the former monumental bullring Chofre demolished in 1973, on a site currently occupied by a housing estate. The district shows a dynamic commercial activity, recently boosted by the presence of the Kursaal Congress Centre by the beach.\\r\\nOne of the newest parts in the city, it kept a rural air until not long ago.[12]:60ÿ61 The postwar city council bought the quaint compound of the Aiete Palace for the use of Francisco Franco in 1940, right after the conclusion of the Civil War. The place in turn became the summer residence for the dictator up to 1975.[12]:62 Nowadays home to the Bakearen Etxea or Peace Memorial House.\\r\\nEgia, stemming from (H)Egia (Basque for either bank/shore or hill), is a popular district of Donostia on the right side of the Urumea beyond the train station. At the beginning of the 20th century, a patch of land by the railway started to be used as a football pitch, eventually turning into the official stadium of the local team Real Sociedad before it was transferred in the 1990s to Anoeta,[12]:111 south of Amara Berri (nowadays the site harbours houses). The former tobacco factory building Tabakalera, which has been converted into a Contemporary Culture Centre, conjures up the former industrial past of the area,.[12]:111 Right opposite to this building lies the Cristina Enea park, a public compound with a botanic vocation. Egia holds the city cemetery, Polloe, at the north-east fringes of the district, stretching out to South Intxaurrondo.\\r\\nThis part (meaning 'walnut tree' in Basque) is a large district to the east of the city. The original nucleus lies between the railway and the Ategorrieta Avenue, where still today the farmhouse Intxaurrondo Zar, declared \\"National Monument\\", is situated since the mid-17th century. The railway cuts across the district, the southern side being the fruit of the heavy development undergone in the area during the immigration years of the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, further housing estates have been built up more recently souther beyond the N-1 E-5 E-80 E-70 ring road (South Intxaurrondo). The police force Guardia Civil runs controversial barracks there (works for new housing are underway).\\r\\nAltza (Basque for alder tree) is the easternmost district of San Sebastin along with Bidebieta and Trintxerpe. It was but a quaint village comprising scattered farmhouses and a small nucleus a century ago (2,683 inhabitants in 1910), yet on the arrival of thousands of immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s a rapid and chaotic housing and building activity ensued, resulting in a maze of grey landscape of skyscrapers and 32,531 inhabitants crammed in them (data of 1970), the figure is 20,000 as of 2013[update].[26]\\r\\nIbaeta stands on the former location for various factories (e.g., Cervezas El Le܇n) of San Sebastin, with the buildings of the old industrial estate being demolished in the late 20th century. The levelling of this large flat area paved the ground for a carefully planned modern and elegant housing estate, featuring a new university campus for the public University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU)[19] and institutions such as the Donostia International Physics Center or the Nanotechnology Center. A stream called Konporta flows down along the eastern side of the area, but it was canalized under the ground almost all along to its mouth on the bay pushed by urban building pressure.\\r\\nIt lies by the Urumea at the south-east end of the city. It comprises a small patch of detached houses (Ciudad Jardn) and a core area of 6-odd floor buildings. The district has recently gone through a major makeover, with works finishing in 2008. The road axis coming from important industrial areas (Astigarraga-Hernani) crosses the district heading downtown. A military base stands across the river,[27] home to an uprising in 1936. Attempts by the city council to close it have been unsuccessful so far.\\r\\nNew modern district erected in the 2000s next to the city's inner bypass and south road entrance to Donostia. A pedestrian bridge spans the Urumea river onto the Cristina Enea Park.\\r\\nThe Martutene district bordering to the south on the town of Astigarraga comes next to Loiola in the south direction. This part of the city features an industrial area, a football pitch for lower leagues, a disused vocational training building and enclosure as well as a prison, much in decay and due to be transferred soon to a new location, probably in the municipality's exclave of Zubieta, while this option is coming in for much opposition.\\r\\nThis part stands on the east side of the city at the foot of the Mount Ulia Park, on the left hand side of the road heading from Donostia to Pasaia and Irun. It consists of a residential area, besides holding a number of educational institutions, culture and sports centres built since 1980. The Park of Nurseries of Ulia sits at the base of the road leading to Mount Ulia, with its name deriving from its function as a nursery of plants for the public gardens of Donostia during all the 20th century and until 2008. It includes two ancient water-tanks, architectonic elements, and specific flora and fauna.\\r\\nThe exclave Zubieta (meaning 'place of bridges') was a picturesque old village up to recent years, with a bunch of houses, a unique handball pitch (on account of its single wall as opposed to the regular two) and a church. Yet it has undergone a great urban development, which has rendered the location a built-up area with paved streets and due equipment. Two contested projects are under way to build a solid-waste incinerator and a prison nearby. Historically, neighbours from Donostia held a meeting at a house in the former village in the wake of the 1813 burning, in order to decide the reconstruction of the town.\\r\\nSan Sebastin shows a dynamic cultural scene, where grass-roots initiative based on different parts of the city and the concerted private and public synergy have paved the ground for a rich range of possibilities and events catering to the tastes of a wide and selected public alike. The city was selected as European Capital of Culture for 2016 (shared with Wroc?aw, Poland) with a basic motto, \\"Waves of people's energy\\", summarizing a clear message: people and movements of citizens are the real driving force behind transformations and changes in the world.\\r\\nEvents ranging from traditional city festivals to music, theatre or cinema take place all year round, while they specially thrive in summer. In the last week of July, San Sebastin's Jazz Festival (Jazzaldia), the longest, continuously running Jazz Festival in Europe is held. In different spots of the city gigs are staged, sometimes with free admission. The Musical Fortnight comes next extending for at least fifteen days well into August and featuring classical music concerts. In September, the San Sebastin International Film Festival comes to the spotlight, an event with more than 50 years revolving around the venues of Kursaal and the Victoria Eugenia Theatre. The city is also home to the San Telmo Museoa, a major cultural institution with an ethnographic, artistic and civic vocation.\\r\\nSticking to the cinematic language but lacking its echo, Street Zinema is an international audiovisual festival exploring contemporary art and urban cultures. Other rising and popular events include the Horror and Fantasy Festival in October (21st edition in 2010) and the Surfilm Festibal, a cinema festival featuring surfing footage, especially shorts. During centuries, the city has been open to many influences that have left a trace, often mingling with the local customs and traditions and eventually resulting in festivals and new customs.\\r\\nEvery year on 20 January (the feast of Saint Sebastian), the people of San Sebastin celebrate a festival known as the \\"Tamborrada\\". At midnight, in the Konstituzio plaza in the \\"Alde Zaharra/Parte Vieja\\" (Old Part), the mayor raises the flag of San Sebastin (see in the infobox). For 24 hours, the entire city is awash with the sound of drums. The adults, dressed as cooks and soldiers, march around the city. They march all night with their cook hats and white aprons with the March of San Sebastin.[27]\\r\\nOn this day a procession was held in the early 19th century from the Santa Maria Church in the Old Part to the San Sebastin Church in the district of Antiguo, while later limited on the grounds of weather conditions to the in-wall area. The event finished with a popular dancing accompanied on the military band's flutes and drums. In addition, every day a soldier parade took place to change the guards at the town's southern walls. Since the San Sebastin Day was the first festival heralding the upcoming Carnival, it's no surprise that some youths in Carnival mood followed them aping their martial manners and drumrolls, using for the purpose the buckets left at the fountains.[16]:107 In the period spanning the 1860s and 1880s the celebrations started to shape as we know them today with proper military style outfits and parades and the tunes fashioned by music composer Raimundo Sarriegui.[16]:110\\r\\nAdults usually have dinner in txokos (\\"gourmet clubs\\"), who traditionally admitted only males, but nowadays even the strictest ones allow women on the \\"Noche de la Tamborrada\\". They eat sophisticated meals cooked by themselves, mostly composed of seafood (traditionally elvers, now no longer served due to its exorbitant price) and drink the best wines. For \\"Donostiarras\\" this is the most celebrated festival of the year.\\r\\nA festival called Semana Grande in Spanish and Aste Nagusia in Basque (\\"Big/Main Week\\") is held every year in mid-August. An important international fireworks contest takes place, in which a fireworks presentation is made every night over the bay and, at the end, the contest's winner is declared.[27] It also highlights the parade of giants and big-heads every afternoon.\\r\\nThis decades long festivity taking place at the beginning of September features events related to Basque culture, such as performances of traditional improvising poets (bertsolaris), Basque pelota games, stone lifting contests, oxen wagers, dance exhibitions or the cider tasting festival. Yet the main highlight may be the rowing boat competition, where teams from different towns of the Bay of Biscay contend for the Flag of La Concha. Thousands of supporters coming from these coastal locations pour into the city's streets and promenades overlooking the bay to follow the event, especially on the Sunday of the final race. All day long the streets of the Old Part play host to droves of youths clad in their team colours who party there in a cheerful atmosphere.\\r\\nSaint Agatha's Eve is a traditional event taking place at the beginning of February or end of January in many spots of the Basque Country. It holds a small but cherished slot in the city's run-up to the Carnival. Groups dressed up in Basque traditional farmer costume march across the neighbourhood singing and wielding a characteristic stick beaten on the ground to the rhythm of the traditional Saint Agatha's tune.[27] The singers ask for a small donation, which can be money, a drink or something to eat.\\r\\nThis is a local festival held on the first Saturday of February linked to the upcoming Carnival, where different groups of people dressed in Romani (Gypsy) tinkers attire take to the streets banging rhythmically a hammer or spoon against a pot or pan, and usually bar-hop while they sing the traditional songs for the occasion. They were just men voices some time ago, but women participate and sing currently too. The festival is 131 years old in 2015.\\r\\nThis popular festival takes place on the 21 December, a date frequently shrouded in winter cold. From early in the morning, stalls are arranged across the city centre and people from all Gipuzkoa flock to the streets of the centre and the Old Part, with crowds of people often dressed in traditional Basque \\"farmer\\" outfit turning out and filling the area. Traditional and typical produce is showcased and sold on the stalls, while the main drink is cider and the most popular snacks are txistorra (a type of thin, uncured chorizo) wrapped in talos (flatbread). A large pig is on display in the Konstituzio Plaza, which is raffled off during the festival.[27]\\r\\nAs in other Basque cities, towns and villages, on Christmas Eve the Olentzero and the accompanying carol singers usually dressed in Basque farmer costume take over the streets, especially in the city centre, asking for small donations in bars, shops and banks after singing their repertoire. Sometimes Olentzero choirs roam around the streets in later dates, on the 31st for example, and are often related to cultural, social or political associations and demands.\\r\\nThe main economic activities are commerce and tourism. San Sebastin is one of the most famous tourist destinations in Spain.[7]\\r\\nThe international technology organisation Ikusi is based in San Sebastin.\\r\\nDonostia is renowned for its Basque cuisine. San Sebastin and its surrounding area is home to a high concentration of restaurants boasting Michelin stars including Arzak (San Sebastin), Berasategi (Lasarte), Akelarre (district Igeldo) and Mugaritz (Errenteria), to mention but a few.[28] It is the second city with the most Michelin stars per capita in the world,[29] only behind Kyoto, Japan. Additionally, based on the 2013 ranking, two of the world's top ten best restaurants can be found here.[30] Adding to these cooking highlights, the city features tasty snacks similar to tapas called pintxos, which may be found at the bars of the Old Quarter.\\r\\nIt is also the birthplace of Basque gastronomical societies, with the oldest recorded mention of such a txoko back in 1870. In addition, it boasts the first institution to offer a university degree in Gastronomy, Basque Culinary Center.[31]\\r\\nDonostia-San Sebastin has become an important University town. Four universities and a superior conservatory are present in the city:\\r\\nThe secondary studies activity is having an increasing impact on social, cultural, technological and economical levels of the city and surroundings. With its pushing innovative and research centers and its research strategies it is becoming one of Spain's main Science production locations, along with Barcelona, Madrid, Bilbao, Seville and Valencia, among others. Donostia-San Sebastian's Scientific production covers areas like Materials Science, Cancer Research, Alzheimer and Parkinson, Architecture, Polymer Science, Biomaterials, Nanotechnology, Robotics or Informatics.\\r\\nThe principal football club in the city is Real Sociedad. After three seasons in the Segunda Divisi܇n, the club won promotion back to La Liga after winning the 2009ÿ10 Segunda Divisi܇n.[32] Real Sociedad was one of the founding members of the top division in Spanish football, La Liga. They enjoyed a particularly successful period of history in the early 1980s when they were Spanish champions for two years running (1980ÿ81, 1981ÿ82). The city's Anoeta Stadium located at the Anoeta Sports Complex is home to the Real Sociedad and also hosts rugby union matches featuring Biarritz Olympique or Aviron Bayonnais.\\r\\nEach summer the city plays host to a well known cycling race, the one-day Clsica de San Sebastin (\\"San Sebastin Classic\\"). Cycling races are extremely popular in Spain, and the Clsica de San Sebastin professional is held during early August. It has been held annually in San Sebastin since 1981. The race is part of the UCI ProTour and was previously part of its predecessor the UCI Road World Cup.\\r\\nSan Sebastin is twinned with:","input":"What is the population of san sebastian spain?"},{"output":"part of the executive branch of the federal government of the United States that normally acts as an advisory body to the President of the United States","context":" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cabinet of the United States is part of the executive branch of the federal government of the United States that normally acts as an advisory body to the President of the United States. Among the senior officers of the Cabinet are the Vice President and the heads of the federal executive departments, all of whom are by federal law (3 U.S.C.??19) in the line of succession to the Presidency and have duties under the 25th Amendment to the Constitution. Members of the Cabinet (except for the Vice President) serve at the pleasure of the President, who can dismiss them at will for no cause. All federal public officials, including Cabinet members, are also subject to impeachment by the House of Representatives and trial in the Senate for \\"treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors\\".\\r\\nThe President can also unilaterally designate senior White House staffers, heads of other federal agencies and the Ambassador to the United Nations as members of the Cabinet, although this is a symbolic status marker and does not, apart from attending Cabinet meetings, confer any additional powers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no explicit reference to a \\"Cabinet\\" in the United States Constitution, the United States Code, or the Code of Federal Regulations. In the Constitution, the President is authorized (but not compelled) to \\"require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices.\\" The Constitution does not provide for an explicit forum where the principal officers' opinions can be obtained less formally, without writing, such as a formal Cabinet.\\r\\nGeorge Washington, the first U.S. President, organized his principal officers into a Cabinet, and it has been part of the executive branch structure ever since. Washington's Cabinet consisted of five members: himself, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of War Henry Knox and Attorney General Edmund Randolph. Vice President John Adams was not included in Washington's Cabinet because the position was initially regarded as a legislative officer (President of the Senate).[1] It was not until the 20th Century that Vice Presidents were regularly included as members of the Cabinet and came to be regarded primarily as a member of the executive branch.\\r\\nPresidents have used Cabinet meetings of selected principal officers but to widely differing extents and for different purposes. Secretary of State William H. Seward and then Professor Woodrow Wilson advocated use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet government. But President Abraham Lincoln rebuffed Seward, and Woodrow Wilson would have none of it in his administration. In recent administrations, Cabinets have grown to include key White House staff in addition to department and various agency heads. President Ronald Reagan formed seven subcabinet councils to review many policy issues, and subsequent Presidents have followed that practice.[2]\\r\\nThe term \\"principal Officer in each of the executive Departments\\" is mentioned in the Opinion Clause (Article II, Section 2, Clause 1) and the term \\"Heads of Departments\\" is mentioned in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution. The term \\"principal officers of the executive departments\\" is also mentioned in the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Section 4, the executive departments being listed in 5 U.S.C.??101. Although there are occasional references to \\"Cabinet-level officers,\\" which when viewed in their context do refer to these \\"principal officers\\" and \\"heads of departments,\\" the terms \\"principal officers\\" and \\"heads of departments\\" are not necessarily synonymous with \\"Cabinet\\" members.\\r\\nIn 3 U.S.C.??302 with regard to delegation of authority by the President, it is provided that \\"nothing herein shall be deemed to require express authorization in any case in which such an official would be presumed in law to have acted by authority or direction of the President.\\" This pertains directly to the heads of the executive departments as each of their offices is created and specified by statutory law (hence the presumption) and thus gives them the authority to act for the President within their areas of responsibility without any specific delegation.\\r\\nUnder the 1967 Federal Anti-Nepotism statute, federal officials are prohibited from appointing their immediate family members to certain governmental positions, including those in the Cabinet.[3]\\r\\nUnder the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, an incoming administration may appoint acting heads of department from employees of the relevant department. These may be existing high-level career employees, from political appointees of the outgoing administration, or sometimes lower-level appointees of the incoming administration.[4]\\r\\nThe heads of the executive departments and all other federal agency heads are nominated by the President and then presented to the Senate for confirmation or rejection by a simple majority (although before the use of the \\"nuclear option\\" during the 113th US Congress, they could have been blocked by filibuster, requiring cloture to be invoked by ?3?5 supermajority to further consideration). If approved, they receive their commission scroll, are sworn in and then begin their duties.\\r\\nAn elected Vice President does not require Senate confirmation, nor does the White House Chief of Staff, which is an appointed staff position of the Executive Office of the President.\\r\\nThe heads of the executive departments and most other senior federal officers at cabinet or sub-cabinet level receive their salary under a fixed five level pay plan known as the Executive Schedule, which is codified in Title 5 of the United States Code. 21 positions, including the heads of the executive departments and others, receiving Level I pay are listed in 5 U.S.C.??5312, and those 46 positions on Level II pay (including the number two positions of the executive departments) are listed in 5 U.S.C.??5313. As of January 2016, the Level I annual pay was set at $205,700.[5]\\r\\nThe annual salary of the Vice President is $235,300.[5] The salary level was set by the Government Salary Reform Act of 1989, which also provides an automatic cost of living adjustment for federal employees. The Vice President does not automatically receive a pension based on that office, but instead receives the same pension as other members of Congress based on his ex officio position as President of the Senate.[6]\\r\\nThe individuals listed below were nominated by President Donald Trump to form his Cabinet and were confirmed by the United States Senate on the date noted, or are serving as acting department heads by his request pending the confirmation of his nominees.

He was the offensive coordinator and assistant head coach of the Cowboys before being promoted to interim head coach after the firing of Wade Phillips on November 8, 2010. Garrett was also a professional American football quarterback in the NFL for the Dallas Cowboys, New York Giants, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Miami Dolphins. He played college football at Princeton University.\\r\\n\\r\\nGarrett went to prep school at University School in Hunting Valley, Ohio, and was a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. In football, as a senior, he won All-League honors as a quarterback and safety. He graduated from University School in 1984.\\r\\n\\r\\nGarrett attended grade school at Holy Cross school in Rumson, New Jersey.\\r\\n\\r\\nGarrett was accepted to Princeton, where he began as the starting quarterback of the freshman team, registering 64 completions on 116 attempts for 996 yards. He transferred to Columbia University when his father, Jim Garrett became the head coach in 1985. Following his father's resignation after Columbia's 0ÿ10 1985 season, he and his brothers (Judd and John) transferred to Princeton University, although none played varsity in 1986 for different reasons (Jason was an ineligible transfer).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat out the 1986 season because of the transfer rules, while focusing on running the scout team, which included his brothers. The next year, as a junior, he was named the starting quarterback. Although he piloted Princeton to a win against his former team Columbia (a loss that gave Columbia the Division I record for straight losses, at 35), he was also involved in a losing effort against them as a senior, snapping Columbia's by then 44-game losing streak.[2] He received the Asa S. Bushnell Cup as the Ivy League Player of the Year. He earned a degree in history in 1989.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe finished his college career completing 366 of 550 passes (66.5%) for 4,274 yards and 20 touchdowns. At the time he was ranked in the categories: lowest pass interception percentage (1.8% ÿ school record), total yards of offense (4,555 ÿ second in school history), total yards of offense in a season (2,485 third in school history), most passing yards (4,274 ÿ second in school history), most passing yards in a season (2,217ÿ- fourth in school history), most completions (366 ÿ second in school history), most completions in a season (204 ÿ third in school history), most touchdown passes (20 ÿ tied for fourth). He continues to hold the Ivy League career record for completion percentage with 66.5% (366ÿ550) and his 1988 percentage of 68.2% (204ÿ299) stood as the league record until 2000, when Gavin Hoffman posted a 70.5% mark.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nGarrett was signed as an undrafted free agent by the New Orleans Saints after the 1989 NFL Draft and was eventually signed to the practice squad. On September 3, 1990, he was waived by the Saints and spent most of the year working as a coaching assistant for Princeton.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991, Garrett started at quarterback for the San Antonio Riders of the World League of American Football, but he suffered a separated right shoulder in the season opener.[6] Garrett returned to start the sixth and seventh game but was passed on the depth chart by Mike Johnson.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 4, 1991, he was signed by the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League,[7] but was released in August.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992, with the support of his father, at the time a part of the Dallas Cowboys scouting department, Garrett was signed as a free agent. He was released on August 31 and later signed to the team's practice squad.[8] In 1993, his preseason performances allowed him to make the team as the third-string quarterback behind Troy Aikman and Hugh Millen. He eventually passed Millen on the depth chart. In the eighth game of the season, after Aikman injured his left hamstring against the New York Giants in the third quarter, Garrett finished the game, completing 5 of 6 passes for 34 yards and leading 2 touchdown drives. He was named the starter for the next game against the Phoenix Cardinals, where he completed 2 of 6 passes for 25 yards and helped the team score on a field goal, before being replaced on the third series in favor of Bernie Kosar, who had been signed 4 days earlier.[9] Kosar became the backup quarterback for the rest of the season after the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highlight of Garrett's playing career occurred on the 1994 Thanksgiving Day game when he started in place of backup quarterback Rodney Peete, who was out with a sprained thumb he suffered in a win against the Washington Redskins. Garrett led the Cowboys over the Green Bay Packers by completing 15 of 26 passes for 311 yards and 2 touchdowns in the second half for a comeback win of 42-31, which earned him NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[10] In 2008, that game was named the fourth-best moment in the history of Texas Stadium by ESPN.[11]. In 1995 he was promoted to the backup position and in the second game against the Denver Broncos, after Aikman suffered a broken clavicle, Garrett came in to finish the 23-42 loss. He would start the next five games and contribute to a 3-2 mark for a team that would go on to win the NFC East conference by one game over the Arizona Cardinals. In 1999, he started two games for a 1ÿ1 record.\\r\\n\\r\\nGarrett was a part of the 1993 and 1995 Super Bowl winning teams.

On February 27, 2002, he was released for salary cap reasons and re-signed on July 24,[12][13]  although he would be declared inactive in 16 games, after being passed on the depth chart by Jesse Palmer who was named the backup quarterback. In 2003, he was declared inactive in 11 games as the third-string quarterback.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 15, 2004, Garrett signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and was cut on August 31.[14] On October 13, he was re-signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. After being declared inactive in week 6 and week 7, he was released on November 6.[15] On November 24, he was signed as a free agent by the Miami Dolphins and was declared inactive for the last 6 games of the season.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter retiring as a player, he became the quarterbacks coach for the Miami Dolphins in 2005ÿ2006 under head coach Nick Saban.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2007, Garrett was hired by the Dallas Cowboys as offensive coordinator. He guided the Cowboys to the 2nd best offense in the NFL, which made him an attractive head coaching prospect. In January 2008, Garrett interviewed for the head coaching job of the Baltimore Ravens and the Atlanta Falcons receiving offers from both, but ultimately opted to remain in Dallas.[17] His salary for the 2008 season was nearly $3 million; the highest salary for an assistant coach in the NFL at the time.[18] On December 29, 2008, the Detroit Lions received permission to speak to Garrett regarding the team's head coaching vacancy according to ESPN sources.[19] In January 2009, the Denver Broncos also interviewed him as a possible replacement for fired coach Mike Shanahan.[20] He was also a finalist for the St. Louis Rams head coaching position, to replace Jim Haslett, the interim head coach.[21] Ultimately, he lost the job to Steve Spagnuolo.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 8, 2010, Garrett was named as interim head coach of the Cowboys after fourth-year head coach Wade Phillips was fired after a 1ÿ7 start for the 2010 season. On November 14, Garrett won his first game as a head coach, beating the favored New York Giants by a score of 33ÿ20 in the Meadowlands.[22] The next week, he led the Cowboys to a 35ÿ19 victory over the Detroit Lions, their first home win all season. He finished with a 5-3 record down the stretch. On January 6, 2011, Garrett was officially named the 8th head coach in Cowboys history. He is the first born after the team was founded in 1960, and the first former Cowboys player to hold the post.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had three straight 8-8 seasons, losing in the last game each season to NFC East division rivals New York Giants, Washington Redskins, and Philadelphia Eagles to miss the division championship and the playoffs each time. In 2014, Garrett achieved head-coaching success for the first time. The Cowboys, featuring several key draft picks maturing as the league's best offensive line and the emergence of DeMarco Murray as a dominant running back, won the NFC East with a 12-4 record and were tied for the best record in the conference with the Green Bay Packers and the Seattle Seahawks. The Cowboys were undefeated on the road, including impressive wins over Seattle and the NFC East frontrunners (at the time), the Philadelphia Eagles.[23] Garrett's team lost the three-way tiebreaker to Green Bay and Seattle and therefore hosted the Detroit Lions in a Wildcard game. This game, won 24-20 by the Cowboys, featured a controversial \\"flag pick up\\" after a penalty during a late Detroit drive, thereby allowing Dallas an improved chance to make a comeback and defeat the Lions.[24] In the ensuing Divisional Playoff game, hyped as a rematch of the famous Ice Bowl NFL championship game from 1967, Dallas held a lead in the second half, but after losing the lead due to a late Aaron Rodgers touchdown pass, had a potentially game-winning catch by Dez Bryant overturned in official replay, therefore sealing a 26-21 defeat to Green Bay.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 13, 2015, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and Garrett came to an agreement of a contract, keeping Garrett in Dallas for 5 more years and paying him $30 million.[26] Garrett has now head-coached the Cowboys longer than any other coach except Tom Landry. The Cowboys entered the 2015 season with great expectations, but starting quarterback Tony Romo only played in 4 games after suffering two fractures in his left collarbone, and the team finished with a 4-12 mark. The Cowboys bounced back in 2016 with their best record under Garrett (13-3) with the emergence of rookie quarterback Dak Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott, earning the #1 NFC spot in the playoffs and a first-round bye. However, they were upset by Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers by a last second field goal by Mason Crosby, losing the game 34-31. Garrett was named the NFL Coach of the Year for the 2016 season.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\n* ÿ Interim head coach\\r\\n\\r\\nJason's brothers, John and Judd, also played in the World League of American Football, and Judd made second-team All-World League in 1991 after leading the league in catches.

It followed the Bank of North America, the nation's first de facto central bank.\\r\\nEstablishment of the Bank of the United States was part of a three-part expansion of federal fiscal and monetary power, along with a federal mint and excise taxes, championed by Alexander Hamilton, first Secretary of the Treasury. Hamilton believed a national bank was necessary to stabilize and improve the nation's credit, and to improve handling of the financial business of the United States government under the newly enacted Constitution.\\r\\nThe First Bank building, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, within Independence National Historical Park, was completed in 1797, and is a National Historic Landmark for its historic and architectural significance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1791, The First Bank of the United States was one of the four major financial innovations proposed and supported by Hamilton, first Secretary of the Treasury. In addition to the national bank, the other measures were assumption of the state war debts by the U.S. Government, establishment of a mint and imposition of a federal excise tax. The goals of Hamilton's three measures were to:[2]\\r\\nIn simpler words, Hamilton's four goals were to\\r\\nAccording to the plan put before the first session of the First Congress in 1790, Hamilton proposed establishing the initial funding for the First Bank of the United States through the sale of $10 million in stock of which the United States government would purchase the first $2 million in shares. Hamilton, foreseeing the objection that this could not be done since the U.S. government did not have $2 million, proposed that the government make the stock purchase using money lent to it by the bank; the loan to be paid back in ten equal annual installments. The remaining $8 million of stock would be available to the public, both in the United States and overseas. The chief requirement of these non-government purchases was that one-quarter of the purchase price had to be paid in gold or silver; the remaining balance could be paid in bonds, acceptable scrip, etc.[6]\\r\\nBy continuously insisting on these conditions, the First Bank of the United States might technically possess $500,000 in \\"real\\" money that it could, and would, use as security to make loans up to its capitalized limit of $10 million.[7] However, unlike the Bank of England, the primary function of the bank would be credit issued to government and private interests, for internal improvements and other economic development, per Hamilton's system of Public Credit. The business it would be involved in on behalf of the federal governmenta depository for collected taxes, making short term loans to the government to cover real or potential temporary income gaps, serving as a holding site for both incoming and outgoing monieswas considered highly important but still secondary in nature.[8]\\r\\nThere were other, nonnegotiable conditions for the establishment of the First Bank of the United States. Among these were:[citation needed]\\r\\nTo ensure that the government could meet both the current and future demands of its governmental accounts, an additional source of funding was required, \\"for interest payments on the assumed state debts would begin to fall due at the end of 1791...those payments would require $788,333 annually, and... an additional $38,291 was needed to cover deficiencies in the funds that had been appropriated for existing commitments.\\"[10] To achieve this, Hamilton repeated a suggestion he had made nearly a year beforeincrease the duty on imported spirits, plus raise the excise tax on domestically distilled whiskey and other liquors. Local opposition to the tax led to the Whiskey Rebellion.\\r\\nHamilton's bank proposal faced widespread resistance from opponents of increased federal power. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and James Madison led the opposition, which claimed that the bank was unconstitutional, and that it benefited merchants and investors at the expense of the majority of the population.\\r\\nLike most of the Southern members of Congress,[13] Jefferson and Madison also opposed a second of the three proposals of Hamilton: establishing an official government Mint. They believed this centralization of power away from local banks was dangerous to a sound monetary system and was mostly to the benefit of business interests in the commercial north, not southern agricultural interests, arguing that the right to own property would be infringed by these proposals. Furthermore, they contended that the creation of such a bank violated the Constitution, which specifically stated that congress was to regulate weights and measures and issue coined money (rather than mint and bills of credit).[14]\\r\\nThe first part of the bill, the concept and establishment of a national mint, met with no real objection, and sailed through; it was assumed the second and third part (the bank and an excise tax to finance it) would likewise glide through, and in their own way they did: The House version of the bill, despite some heated objections, easily passed. The Senate version of the bill did likewise, with considerably fewer, and milder, objections. It was when \\"the two bills changed houses, complications set in. In the Senate, Hamilton's supporters objected to the House's alteration of the plans for the excise tax.\\"[7]\\r\\nThe establishment of the bank also raised early questions of constitutionality in the new government. Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, argued that the bank was an effective means to utilize the authorized powers of the government implied under the law of the Constitution. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson argued that the bank violated traditional property laws and that its relevance to constitutionally authorized powers was weak. Another argument came from James Madison, who believed Congress had not received the power to incorporate a bank, or any other governmental agency. His argument rested primarily on the Tenth Amendment: that all powers not endowed to Congress are retained by the States (or the people). Additionally, his belief was that if the Constitution's writers had wanted Congress to have such power, they would have made it explicit. The decision would ultimately fall on President George Washington, following his deliberate investigation of the cabinet members' opinions.[15]\\r\\nGeorge Washington initially declared that he was hesitant to sign the \\"bank bill\\" into law. Washington asked for the written advice and supporting reasons from all his cabinet membersmost particularly from Hamilton. Attorney General Edmund Randolph from Virginia felt that the bill was unconstitutional. Jefferson, also from Virginia, agreed that Hamilton's proposal was against both the spirit and letter of the Constitution. Hamilton, who, unlike his fellow cabinet members, came from New York, quickly responded to those who claimed incorporation of the bank unconstitutional. While Hamilton's rebuttals were many and varied, chief among them were these two:\\r\\nOn February 25, 1791, convinced that the constitution authorized the measure,[15] Washington signed the \\"bank bill\\" into law.\\r\\nOn March 19, 1791 Washington appointed three Commissioners for the taking of subscriptions for this new bank: Thomas Willing, David Rittenhouse, and Samuel Howell.[17]\\r\\nAfter Hamilton left office in 1795, the new Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott, Jr. informed Congress that, due to the existing state of government finances, more money was needed. This could be achieved either by selling the government's shares of stock in the bank, or by raising taxes. Wolcott advised the first choice. Congress quickly agreed. Hamilton objected, believing that the dividends on that stock had been inviolably pledged for the support of the sinking fund to retire the debt. Hamilton tried to organize opposition to the measure, but was unsuccessful.\\r\\nIn 1811, the U.S. Senate tied on a vote to renew the bank's charter. Vice President George Clinton broke the tie and voted against renewal. The bank's charter thus expired in 1811.\\r\\nIn 1816, the bank was succeeded by the Second Bank of the United States.\\r\\nAfter the charter for the First Bank of the United States expired in 1811, Stephen Girard purchased most of its stock as well as the building and its furnishings on South Third Street in Philadelphia and opened his own bank, later known as Girard Bank. Girard hired George Simpson, the cashier of the First Bank of the United States, as cashier of the new bank, and with seven other employees, opened for business on May 18, 1812. He allowed the Trustees of the First Bank of the United States to use some offices and space in the vaults to continue the process of winding down the affairs of the closed bank at a very nominal rent.[18]\\r\\nOver its early history the bank was known as Girards Bank,[19] or as Girard Bank [20] or also as Stephen Girards Bank or even the Bank of Stephen Girard. [19] Girard was the sole proprietor of his bank, and thus avoided the Pennsylvania state law which prohibited an unincorporated association of persons from establishing a bank, and which required a charter from the legislature for a banking corporation.[21]\\r\\nThe First Bank of the United States was established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, while the city served as the national capital, from 1790 to 1800. In the eighteenth century, Philadelphia was one of the largest cities in the English-speaking world. The bank began operations in Carpenters' Hall in 1791, some 200 feet from its permanent home.\\r\\nDesign of the bank building is credited to Samuel Blodgett, Superintendent of Buildings for the new capital in Washington, DC.,[23] although it has also been attributed to James Hoban.[24][25] It was completed in 1795.[26]\\r\\nThe First Bank of the United States has received various designations as a historic building. It was included in Independence National Historical Park when the park was formed in 1956. The building's architecture was studied by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1958.[24] With the rest of Independence National Historical Park, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966, and the bank was then declared a National Historic Landmark on May 4, 1987. It is described in the landmark designation as an early masterpiece of monumental Classical Revival design.[27]\\r\\nUntil about 2000, the building housed offices for Independence National Historical Park. A proposal to have it house the collection of the Philadelphia Civil War Museum was abandoned when funding from the state of Pennsylvania was not forthcoming.[28] Future plans are for it to house the National Park Service archaeology lab, currently across the street in the old Visitor Center.","input":"Who is responsible for founding the american financial system?"},{"output":"August 12, 1991","context":"Metallica (commonly known as The Black Album) is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica. Released on August 12, 1991 by Elektra Records, it received widespread critical acclaim and became the band's best-selling album. Metallica produced five singles that are considered to be among the band's best-known songs, which include \\"Enter Sandman\\", \\"The Unforgiven\\", \\"Nothing Else Matters\\", \\"Wherever I May Roam\\", and \\"Sad but True\\". \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" was also issued to rock radio shortly after the album's release, but the song did not receive a commercial single release. The album marked a change in the band's sound from the thrash metal style of the previous four albums to a slower one. Metallica promoted the album with a series of tours. In 2003, the album was ranked number 252 on Rolling Stone's 500 greatest albums of all time.\\r\\nThe recording of Metallica was troubled, as the band frequently entered conflicts with Bob Rock, the band's new producer, during production. The album debuted at number one in ten countries and spent four consecutive weeks at the top of the Billboard 200, making it Metallica's first album to top album charts. By February 2016, the album spent 363 weeks on the Billboard album chart, making it one of the ten longest running discs of all time. Metallica is one of the best-selling albums worldwide, and the best-selling albums in the United States since Nielsen SoundScan tracking began. The album was certified 16G platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012, and has sold over sixteen million copies in the United States, the first album in the SoundScan era to do so. Metallica played the album in its entirety during the 2012 European Black Album Tour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of Metallica's recording, the band's songs were written mainly by frontman James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, with Hetfield being the lyricist.[6] The duo frequently composed together at Ulrich's house in Berkeley, California. Several song ideas and concepts were conceived by other members of the band, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Jason Newsted.[7] For instance, Newsted wrote the main riff of \\"My Friend of Misery\\", which was originally intended to be an instrumental, one of which had been included on every previous Metallica album.[8] The songs were written in two months in mid-1990; the ideas for some of them were originated during the Damaged Justice Tour.[9] Metallica was impressed with Bob Rock's production work on M?tley Cre's Dr. Feelgood (1989) and decided to hire him to work on their album.[10][11] Initially, the band members were not interested in having Rock producing the album as well, but changed their minds. Ulrich said, \\"We felt that we still had our best record in us and Bob Rock could help us make it\\".[11]\\r\\nFour demos for the album were recorded on August 13, 1990; \\"Enter Sandman\\", \\"The Unforgiven\\", \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" and \\"Wherever I May Roam.\\" The lead single \\"Enter Sandman\\" was the first song to be written and the last to receive lyrics.[12] On October 4, 1990, a demo of \\"Sad but True\\" was recorded. In October 1990, Metallica began recording at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, to record the album, and also at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia for about a week.[10] On June 2, 1991, a demo of \\"Holier Than Thou\\" was recorded. Hetfield stated about the recording: \\"What we really wanted was a live feel. In the past, Lars and I constructed the rhythm parts without Kirk and Jason. This time I wanted to try playing as a band unit in the studio. It lightens things up and you get more of a vibe.\\"[13]\\r\\nBecause it was Rock's first time producing a Metallica album, he had the band make the album in different ways; he asked them to record songs collaboratively rather than individually in separate locations.[10] He also suggested recording tracks live and using harmonic vocals for Hetfield.[14] Rock was expecting the production to be \\"easy\\" but had trouble working with the band, leading to frequent, engaged arguments with the band members over aspects of the album.[10] Rock wanted Hetfield to write better lyrics and found his experience recording with Metallica disappointing.[10][15][16] Since the band was perfectionist,[8][15] Rock insisted they recorded as many takes as needed to get the sound they wanted.[6] The album was remixed three times and cost US$1?million.[17] The troubled production coincided with Ulrich, Hammett and Newsted divorcing their wives; Hammett said this influenced their playing because they were \\"trying to take those feeling of guilt and failure and channel them into the music, to get something positive out of it\\".[18]\\r\\nRock altered Metallica's familiar recording routine and the recording experience was so stressful that Rock briefly swore never to work with the band again.[16] The tension between band and producer was documented in A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica and Classic Albums: Metallica ÿ Metallica, documentaries that explore the intense recording process that resulted in Metallica.[6][7] Despite the controversies between the band and Rock, he continued to work with Metallica through the 2003 album St. Anger.[16] After the production of St. Anger (2003), the fourth and final Metallica record Rock would produce, a petition signed by 1,500 fans was posted online in an attempt to encourage the band to prohibit Rock from producing Metallica albums, saying he had too much influence on the band's sound and musical direction.[19] Rock said the petition hurt his children's feelings;[19] he said, \\"sometimes, even with a great coach, a team keeps losing. You have to get new blood in there.\\"[19]\\r\\nAccording to Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone, \\"tempos were often slowed down in exchange for slower BPMs, while they expand its music and expressive range\\".[21] The album was a change in Metallica's direction from the thrash metal style of the band's previous four studio albums towards a more commercial, heavy metal sound, but still had characteristics of thrash metal.[22][6][16] Many fans consider the album to be a transition from the often ostentatious compositions of Metallica's previous releases to the slower, divested style of the band's later albums, where \\"old\\" and \\"new\\" Metallica are distinguished from one another.[21] Instruments not usually used by heavy metal bands, such as the cellos in \\"The Unforgiven\\" and the orchestra in \\"Nothing Else Matters\\", were added at Rock's insistence.[9] Rock also raised the volume of the bass guitar, which had been nearly inaudible on the previous album ...And Justice for All.[14] Newsted said he tried to \\"create a real rhythm section rather than a one-dimensional sound\\" with his bass.[13] Ulrich said he tried to avoid the \\"progressive Peartian paradiddles which became boring to play live\\" in his drumming and used a basic sound similar to those of The Rolling Stones' Charlie Watts and AC/DC's Phil Rudd.[14]\\r\\nThe band took a simpler approach partly because the members felt the songs on ...And Justice for All were too long and complex. Hetfield said that radio airplay was not their intention, but because they felt \\"we had pretty much done the longer song format to death,\\" and considered a good change doing songs with just two riffs and \\"only taking two minutes to get the point across\\".[13] Ulrich added that the band was feeling a musical insecurity  \\"We felt inadequate as musicians and as songwriters, That made us go too far, around Master of Puppets and Justice, in the direction of trying to prove ourselves. 'We'll do all this weird-ass shit sideways to prove that we are capable musicians and songwriters'\\" ÿ and Hetfield added he wanted to avoid getting stale: \\"Sitting there and worrying about whether people are going to like the album, therefore we have to write a certain kind of song  you just end up writing for someone else. Everyone's different. If everyone was the same, it would be boring as shit.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe lyrics of Metallica written by James Hetfield were more personal and introspective in nature than those of previous Metallica albums; Rock said Hetfield's songwriting became more confident, and that he was inspired by Bob Dylan, Bob Marley and John Lennon.[16] According to Chris True of AllMusic, \\"Enter Sandman\\" is about \\"nightmares and all that come with them\\".[23] \\"The God That Failed\\" dealt with the death of Hetfield's mother from cancer and her Christian science beliefs, which kept her from seeking medical treatment. \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" was a love song Hetfield wrote about missing his girlfriend while on tour.[21] Hetfield said the album's lyrical themes were more introspective because he wanted \\"lyrics that the band could stand behind ÿ but we are four completely different individuals. So the only way to go was in.\\"[24]\\r\\nMetallica had much discussion about the album title; the members considered calling it Five or using the title of one of the songs, but eventually chose an eponym because they \\"wanted to keep it simple.\\"[13] The album's cover depicts the band's logo angled against the upper left corner and a coiled snake derived from the Gadsden flag in the bottom right corner. Both emblems are dark gray so they stand out against the black background, giving Metallica the nickname \\"The Black Album\\". These emblems also appear on the back cover of the album.[6] The motto of the Gadsden flag, \\"Don't Tread on Me\\", is also the title of a song on the album. A folded, pageless booklet depicts the faces of the band's members against a black background. The lyrics and liner notes are also printed on a grey background. The cover is reminiscent of Spinal Tap's album Smell the Glove, which the band jokingly acknowledged in its documentary A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica. Members of Spinal Tap appeared on the film and asked Metallica about it, with Lars Ulrich commenting that British rock group Status Quo was the original inspiration as that band's Hello! album cover was also black.[6]\\r\\nSix tracks on Metallica were released as singles. \\"Enter Sandman\\" was released as the lead single on July 29, 1991; it reached number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[25][26] The follow-up single, \\"Don't Tread on Me\\", was released promotionally and peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks singles chart.[26] \\"The Unforgiven\\" was a Top 40 hit; it peaked in the Top 10 in Australia.[27] In 1992, \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" was released to more success, reaching number six in the United Kingdom and Ireland.[28][29] The fifth single from the album was also released in 1992; \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" peaked at number two on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart but was less successful on the Hot 100 chart, failing to reach the Top 80.[26] In 1993, \\"Sad but True\\" did not repeat the successes of the album's previous singles, charting for one week on the Billboard Hot 100 at 98.[26] Almost all singles were accompanied by music videos; the Wayne Isham-directed \\"Enter Sandman\\" promotional film won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards.[30]\\r\\nIn 1991, for the fourth time, Metallica played as part of the Monsters of Rock festival tour. The last concert of the tour was held on September 28, 1991, at Tushino Airfield in Moscow; it was described as \\"the first free outdoor Western rock concert in Soviet history\\" and was attended by an estimated 150,000 to 500,000 people.[31][32] Some unofficial estimates put the attendance as high as 1,600,000.[33] The first tour directly intended to support the album, the Wherever We May Roam Tour, included a performance at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, at which Metallica performed a short set list, consisting of \\"Enter Sandman\\", \\"Sad but True\\" and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\", and Hetfield performed the Queen song \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" with John Deacon, Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen and Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath. At one of the tour's first gigs the floor of the stage collapsed.[34] The January 13 and 14, 1992, shows in San Diego were later released in the box set Live Shit: Binge & Purge,[35] while the tour and the album were documented in the documentary A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica.[36]\\r\\nMetallica's Wherever We May Roam Tour also overlapped with Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion Tour. Hetfield suffered second and third degree burns to his arms, face, hands, and legs on August 8, 1992, during a Montreal show in the co-headlining Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour. The tour included pyrotechnics, which were installed on-stage. Hetfield accidentally walked into a 12-foot (3.7?m) flame shot from a pyrotechnic during a live performance of the introduction of \\"Fade to Black\\".[35] The show was cut short shortly after this accident, so that Guns N' Roses began their concert to malicious reactions from fans. Newsted said Hetfield's skin was \\"bubbling like on The Toxic Avenger\\".[36] The tour recommenced on August 25 in Phoenix, and although Hetfield could sing, he could not play guitar for the remainder of the tour. Guitar technician John Marshall, who had previously filled in on rhythm guitar and was then playing in Metal Church, played guitar for the recovering Hetfield.[36]\\r\\nThe shows in Mexico City across February and March 1993 during the Nowhere Else to Roam tour were recorded, filmed and later also released as part of the band's first box set,[35][36] which was released in November 1993 and titled Live Shit: Binge & Purge. The collection contained three live CDs, three home videos, and a book filled with riders and letters.[37] Pressings of the box set since November 2002 includes two DVDs, the first one being filmed at San Diego on the Wherever We May Roam Tour, and the latter at Seattle on the Damaged Justice Tour.[36] Binge & Purge was packaged as a cardboard box resembling that of a typical tour equipment transport box. The box set also featured a recreated copy of an access pass to the \\"Snakepit\\" part of the tour stage, as well as a cardboard drawing/airbrush stencil for the \\"Scary Guy\\" logo.[34] The Mexico City shows were also the first time the band met future member Robert Trujillo, who was in Suicidal Tendencies at the time.[38]\\r\\nThe final tour supporting the album, the Shit Hits the Sheds Tour, included a performance at Woodstock '94 that followed Nine Inch Nails and preceded Aerosmith on August 13 in front of a crowd of 350,000.[39][40] Some songs, such as \\"Enter Sandman\\", \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" and \\"Sad but True\\", became permanent staples of Metallica's concert setlists during these and subsequent tours. Other songs though, such as \\"Holier Than Thou\\", \\"The God That Failed\\", \\"Through the Never\\", and \\"The Unforgiven\\" were no longer included in performances after 1995 and would not be played again until the 2000s, when Metallica, with Robert Trujillo on bass, began performing a more extensive back catalog of songs after Trujillo joined the band upon completion of the album St. Anger.[41]\\r\\nAfter touring duties for the album were finished, Metallica filed a lawsuit against Elektra Records, which tried to force the record label to terminate the band's contract and give the band ownership of their master recordings. The band based its claim on a section of the California Labor Code that allows employees to be released from a personal services contract after seven years. Metallica had sold 40?million copies worldwide upon the filing of the suit. Metallica had been signed to the label for over a decade but was still operating under the terms of its original 1984 contract, which provided a relatively low 14% royalty rate.[42] The band members said they were taking the action because they were ambivalent about Robert Morgado's refusal to give them another record deal along with Bob Krasnow, who retired from his job at the label shortly afterwards. Elektra responded by counter-suing the band, but in December 1994, Warner Music Group United States chairman Doug Morris offered Metallica a lucrative new deal in exchange for dropping the suit,[43] which was reported to be even more generous than the earlier Krasnow deal. In January 1995, both parties settled out of court with a non-disclosure agreement.[44] Metallica played the album in its entirety during the 2012 European Black Album Tour.[45]\\r\\nMetallica was released to widespread acclaim from both heavy metal journalists and mainstream publications, including NME, The New York Times, and The Village Voice.[55] In Entertainment Weekly, David Browne called it \\"rock's preeminent speed-metal cyclone\\", and said, \\"Metallica may have invented a new genre: progressive thrash\\".[49] Q magazine's Mark Cooper said he found the album's avoidance of metal's typically clumsy metaphors and glossy production refreshing; he said, \\"Metallica manage to rekindle the kind of intensity that fired the likes of Black Sabbath before metal fell in love with its own cliches\\".[53] Select magazine's David Cavanagh believed the album lacks artifice and is \\"disarmingly genuine\\".[54] In his review for Spin, Alec Foege found the music's harmonies vividly performed and said that Metallica showcase their \\"newfound versatility\\" on songs such as \\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"Holier Than Thou\\".[56] Robert Palmer, writing in Rolling Stone, said that several songs sound like \\"hard-rock classics\\" and that, apart from \\"Don't Tread on Me\\", Metallica is an \\"exemplary album of mature but still kickass rock & roll\\".[21] In his guide to Metallica's albums up to that point, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune recommended the album as \\"a great place for Metallica neophytes to start, with its more concise songs and explosive production.\\"[47] Jonathan Gold was less enthusiastic in the Los Angeles Times. He said while Metallica embraced pop sensibilities \\"quite well\\", there was a sense the group was \\"no longer in love with the possibilities of its sound\\" on an album whose difficulty being embraced by the \\"metal cult\\" mirrored Bob Dylan going electric in the mid 1960s.[50]\\r\\nIn a retrospective article, Kerrang! said Metallica is the album that \\"propelled [the band] out of the metal ghetto to true mainstream global rock superstardom\\".[57] Melody Maker said that as a deliberate departure from the band's thrash style on ...And Justice for All, \\"Metallica was slower, less complicated, and probably twice as heavy as anything they'd done before\\".[57] In his review for BBC Music, Sid Smith said that although staunch listeners of the band accused them of selling out, Metallica confidently departed from the style of their previous albums and transitioned \\"from cult metal gods to bona fide rock stars\\".[58] Classic Rock called it \\"the absolute pinnacle of Metallica's long and successful career\\", and credited the album for inspiring 1990s post-grunge music and convincing the music industry to embrace heavy metal as a genre with mass appeal.[59] AllMusic's Steve Huey believed the massive popularity of Metallica inspired other speed metal bands to also embrace a simpler, less progressive sound. He deemed the record \\"a good, but not quite great\\" album, one whose best moments deservedly captured the heavy metal crown, but whose approach also foreshadowed a creative decline for Metallica.[46] Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic and graded the album a \\"dud\\", indicating \\"a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought\\".[60]\\r\\nMetallica was voted the eighth best album of the year in The Village Voice's annual Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1991.[61] Melody Maker ranked it number 16 in its December 1991 list of the year's best albums.[57] In 1992, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance.[62] In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Metallica number 252 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time[63] and 25th on their 2017 list of \\"100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\\".[64] Spin ranked it number 52 in its 1999 list of the \\"90 Greatest Albums of the '90s\\" and said, \\"this record's diamond-tipped tuneage stripped the band's melancholy guitar excess down to melodic, radio-ready bullets and ballads\\".[57] It was included in Q magazine's August 2000 list of the \\"Best Metal Albums of All Time\\"; the magazine said the album \\"transformed them from cult metal heroes into global superstars, bringing a little refinement to their undoubted power\\".[57]\\r\\nMetallica was released on August 12, 1991,[65] and was the band's first album to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 598,000 copies in its first week. It was certified platinum in two weeks and spent four consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200.[66][67] Logging over 390 weeks on the Billboard 200, it is the third longest charting album in the Nielsen SoundScan era, behind Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and Carole King's Tapestry.[68] In 2009, it surpassed Shania Twain's Come on Over as the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. It became the first album in the SoundScan era to pass 16?million in sales,[69] and with 16.4 million copies sold by 2016, Metallica is the best-selling album in the United States since Nielsen SoundScan tracking began in 1991. Of that sum, 5.8 million were purchased on cassette. The album never sold less than 1,000 copies in a week, and moved a weekly average of 5,000 copies in 2016.[70] Metallica was certified 16G platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping sixteen million copies in the US.[69] Metallica sold 31?million copies worldwide on physical media.[71] All five of Metallica's singles, \\"Enter Sandman\\", \\"The Unforgiven\\", \\"Nothing Else Matters\\", \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" and \\"Sad but True\\" reached the Billboard Hot 100.[70]\\r\\nMetallica debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart,[72] and was certified 2G platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipping 600,000 copies in the UK.[73] Metallica topped the charts in Australia,[74] Canada,[75] Germany,[76] New Zealand,[77] Norway,[78] the Netherlands,[79] Sweden,[80] and Switzerland.[81] It also reached the top five in Austria,[82] Finland,[83] and Japan,[84] but failed to reach the top 20 in Ireland, having peaked at number 27.[85] The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) certified the album 12G platinum.[86] It was given a diamond plaque from the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA)[87] and the Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ)[88] for shipping a million and 150,000 copies, respectively.\\r\\nAll lyrics written by James Hetfield.\\r\\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.[89]\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone","input":"What year did metallica black album come out?"},{"output":"5,513","context":"?British Empire\\r\\nAssociated articles\\r\\nThe Battle of Fromelles (French pronunciation:??[f??m?l] (Battle of Fleurbaix, Schlacht von Fromelles 19ÿ20 July 1916) was a British military operation on the Western Front during the First World War, subsidiary to the Battle of the Somme.[a] General Headquarters (GHQ) of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had ordered the First and Second armies to prepare attacks to support the Fourth Army on the Somme 50?mi (80?km) to the south, to exploit any weakening of the German defences opposite. The attack took place 9.9?mi (16?km) from Lille, between the FauquissartÿTrivelet road and Cordonnerie Farm, an area overlooked from Aubers Ridge to the south. The ground was low-lying and much of the defensive fortification by both sides consisted of breastworks, rather than trenches.\\r\\nThe operation was conducted by XI Corps of the First Army with the 61st Division and the 5th Australian Division, Australian Imperial Force (1st AIF) against the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division, supported by two flanking divisions of the German 6th Army. Preparations for the attack were rushed, the troops involved lacked experience in trench warfare and the power of the German defence was significantly underestimated, the attackers being outnumbered 2:1. The advance took place in daylight on a narrow front against defences overlooked by Aubers Ridge, which left German artillery on either side free to fire into the flanks of the attack. A renewal of the attack by the 61st Division early on 20 July was cancelled, after it was realised that German counter-attacks had already forced a retirement by the Australian troops to the original front line.\\r\\nOn 19 July, General Erich von Falkenhayn, the German Chief of the General Staff, had judged the British attack to be a long-anticipated offensive against the 6th Army. The attack gained no ground but inflicted some losses on the Germans and recent research has asserted that troops were held back on the XI Corps front. The next day, when the effect of the attack was known and a captured operation order from XI Corps revealed the limited intent of the operation, Falkenhayn ordered troops to be withdrawn from the SouchezÿVimy area, 20?mi (32?km) from Fromelles; troops were only withdrawn opposite the XI Corps from four to nine weeks later. The attack was the dbut of the AIF on the Western Front and the Australian War Memorial described the battle as \\"the worst 24 hours in Australia's entire history\\". Of 7,080 BEF casualties, 5,533 losses were incurred by the 5th Australian Division; German losses were 1,600ÿ2,000 men, with 150 men taken prisoner.\\r\\nThe course of the Battle of the Somme (1 July ÿ 18 November 1916) had led the British GHQ on 5 July to inform the commanders of the three other British armies that the German defences from the Somme north to the Ancre river might soon fall. The First and Second army commanders were required to choose places to penetrate the German defences, if the attacks on the Somme continued to make progress. Any gaps made were to be widened to exploit the weakness and disorganisation of the German defence. The Second Army commander, General H. Plumer was occupied by preparations for an offensive at Messines Ridge but could spare one division for a joint attack with the First Army at the army boundary. On 8 July, the First Army commander General Charles Monro, ordered the IX Corps commander Lieutenant-General Richard Haking to plan a two-division attack; Haking proposed to capture Aubers Ridge, Aubers and Fromelles but the next day Monro dropped Aubers Ridge from the attack, as he and Plumer had concluded that with the troops available, no great objective could be achieved.[2]\\r\\nOn 13 July, after receiving intelligence reports that the Germans had withdrawn approximately nine infantry battalions from the Lille area from 9ÿ12 July, GHQ informed the two army commanders that a local attack was to be carried out at the army boundary around 18 July, to exploit the depletion of the German units in the vicinity. Haking was ordered to begin a preliminary bombardment, intended to appear to be part of a large offensive, while limiting an infantry attack to the German front line.[2] On 16 July discussions about the attack resumed, as the need for diversions to coincide with operations on the Somme had diminished when the big victory of Bazentin Ridge (14 July 1916) had not led to a general German collapse. Sir Douglas Haig the Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, did not want the attack to take place unless the local commanders were confident of success and Monro and Haking opposed postponement or cancellation of the attack. The weather had been dull on 15 July and rain began next day, soon after Monro and Haking made the decision to proceed with the attack. Zero hour for the main bombardment was postponed because of the weather and at 8:30 a.m., Haking delayed the attack for at least 24 hours; after thinking about cancelling the attack, Monro postponed it until 19 July.[3]\\r\\nThe Second Army provided the 5th Australian Division, the artillery of the 4th Australian Division and heavy guns and trench mortars to XI Corps, to participate in an attack from the FauquissartÿTrivelet road to La Boutillerie with the 31st Division and 61st Division. A shortage of artillery and the lack of training and experience in the Australian divisional artilleries and some of the heavy batteries, led to the attack front being reduced to 4,000?yd (3,700?m) between the FauquissartÿTrivelet road and Delangre Farm. The ground to be attacked was waterlogged, flat and easily overlooked from Aubers Ridge, behind the German front line to the south. The 39th Division and 31st Division moved their boundaries north as the 61st Division concentrated along its attack front from the FauquissartÿTrivelet road to Bond Street. The 20th (Light) Division moved its boundary south to Cordonnerie Farm to take over the left of the 5th Australian Division, which concentrated the divisional frontage from Cordonnerie Farm to Bond Street. The twelve attacking battalions were supported by more artillery than at the Battle of Aubers Ridge in May 1915, when a similar number of battalions attacked in the same area. More ammunition was available than in 1915 and trench mortars were added to the artillery for wire cutting. With support from First Army artillery to the south, 296 field guns and 78 heavy guns were ready, which gave a greater concentration of heavy artillery than that of the Fourth Army on the first day of the Somme.[4][b]\\r\\nAfter several rain delays, visibility increased on 18 July and the artillery bombardment proceeded. The shelling of the German front at La Basse was repeated and the German artillery retaliated. Overnight, British patrols reported no movement in the German lines, which appeared to be weakly held. German covering parties stopped Australian raiders on the right flank of the 5th Australian Division front, where the wire appeared to be intact except for gaps on the left. There was a haze during the morning of 19 July but the time of artillery zero hour was fixed for 11:00 a.m., ready for the infantry attack at 6:00 p.m. A special heavy artillery bombardment began on the Sugarloaf at 2:35 p.m., by which time a German counter-bombardment was falling all along the attack front, causing casualties to the Australians and the field artillery crews of the 61st Division at Rue Tilleloy. Several ammunition dumps were exploded and the decoy lifts by the British artillery failed to deceive the Germans. The Australian and British infantry began to move into no man's land at 5:30 p.m.[6]\\r\\nThe German salient at Fromelles contained some higher ground facing north-west, known as the Sugarloaf.[7] The small size and height of the salient gave the Germans observation of no man's land on either flank.[8] The 5th Australian Division (Major-General J. W. McCay) was to attack the left flank of the salient by advancing south as the 61st Division attacked on the right flank from the west.[9][7] Each division was to attack with three brigades in line, with two battalions from each brigade in the attack and the other two in reserve, ready to take over captured ground or to advance further. Haking issued the attack orders on 14 July, when wire cutting began along the XI Corps front. It was intended that the bombardment would inflict mass casualties on the German infantry, reducing them to a \\"state of collapse\\". The British infantry were to assemble as close to the German lines as possible, no man's land being 100ÿ400?yd (91ÿ366?m) wide, before the British artillery fire was lifted from the front line; the infantry would rush the surviving Germans while they were disorganised and advance to the German second line.[10] Heavy artillery began registration and a slow bombardment on 16 July and two days of bombardment began either side of La Basse canal as a diversion. The main bombardment was to begin at midnight on 17/18 July for seven hours (more rain forced a postponement). Over the final three hours, the artillery was to lift and the infantry show bayonets and dummy figures several times, to simulate an infantry advance, then the artillery was to resume bombardment of the front line to catch the German infantry out of cover.[5]\\r\\nGeneral Erich von Falkenhayn, the German Chief of the General Staff had ordered a construction programme on the Western Front in January 1915, to make it capable of being defended indefinitely by a small force against superior numbers. An elaborate, carefully sited and fortified front position was built behind fields of barbed wire, with camouflaged concrete machine-gun nests and a second trench close behind the front trench to shelter the trench garrison during bombardments. To evade Allied artillery-fire intended to obstruct the movement of reinforcements from the new rear defences, communication trenches were built. The front position was to be held at all costs as the main line of resistance but in May 1915, Falkenhayn ordered a reserve position to be built along the Western Front, 2,000ÿ3,000?yd (1,800ÿ2,700?m) behind the front position, out of range of enemy field artillery. To contain a breakthrough, the second position was to be occupied opposite a sector broken into and serve as a jumping-off point for by counter-attacking troops. If counter-attacks failed to recover the front line, the rear position could be connected to the remaining parts of the front line on either side.[11]\\r\\nThe construction programme was a huge undertaking, which took until autumn 1915 and had several opponents, notably the 6th Army commander Crown Prince Rupprecht, who claimed that a rear position would undermine the determination of soldiers to stand their ground.[11] The front of the 6th Army had been quiet since the Battle of Loos (25 September ÿ 14 October 1915) and in July 1916, the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division held a 4.5?mi (7.2?km) stretch of the front with four regiments, from east of Aubers village, north to a point near Bois-Grenier, each regiment having one battalion in the front line, one in support and one in reserve.[12] On one regimental front there were 75 shelters with 9ÿ12?in (230ÿ300?mm) of concrete protection. After a British gas attack opposite Neuve Chapelle and Fauquissart late on 15 July, German artillery bombarded the British front line and a raid by 100 troops of Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 21 on the Australian lines, caused nearly 100 casualties and took three prisoners for a loss of 32 casualties.[13]\\r\\nIn the 61st Division area, infantry of the 182nd Brigade on the right flank, began to move into no man's land at 5:30 p.m. through sally-ports but some were under German machine-gun fire and became death-traps. Two companies of the right-hand battalion managed to get within 50?yd (46?m) of the German parapet with few losses and rushed the breastwork as the artillery lifted, finding the wire cut and the Germans incapable of resistance. Uncut wire held up the advance to the second line and German machine-gun fire from the right flank caused many casualties as the survivors reached the objective. Reinforcements reached the front trench but German flanking fire caused many losses and German artillery began to bombard the captured area. The left-hand battalion lost more men in no man's land and then found that the wire at the Wick salient was uncut. The few infantry to get through the wire were shot down in front of the front trench; reinforcements were also caught in no man's land and pinned down.[14] In the centre, the 183rd Brigade was bombarded before the advance and shrapnel-fire stopped the infantry from using the sally-ports. After climbing the parapet, both battalions were shot down in no man's land, a few men getting close to the German wire before being killed or wounded. On the left, the attacking battalions of the 184th Brigade had been in the front line under German artillery-fire all morning. On the right, the sally-ports were under fire and only a few troops reached the German wire (which was found to be uncut) before falling back. The left battalion's attack towards the Sugarloaf salient (which was beyond trench-mortar range) was stopped by German fire at the sally-ports and so the infantry tried to exit along \\"Rhondda Sap\\", under a shrapnel bombardment.[c] Most of the battalion was destroyed, but some troops reached the north-east part of the salient and tried to enter the German breastwork, until all became casualties.[16]\\r\\nOn the 5th Australian Division front, the troops attacked over the parapet and had fewer losses than the 61st Division. The 15th (Victoria) Brigade advanced next to the British 183rd Brigade, towards the junction of the German line and Layes brook, which ran diagonally across no man's land. The right battalion advance was stopped after 300?yd (270?m) by machine-gun fire from the Sugarloaf and the left hand battalion was stopped at the German wire, both battalions suffering many losses as the survivors dug in. In the Australian centre the 14th (NSW) Brigade had fewer casualties, reached the German front line and took a number of prisoners. When the Australians advanced further they found only flat fields and ditches full of water. A line was selected for consolidation and ten machine-guns were sent forward. The 8th Brigade battalions attacked through machine-gun fire from the front and flanks. A 1,200?lb (540?kg) mine was blown on the outer flank to make a crater lip to screen the attacking infantry but when the Australians reached the German breastwork they pressed on, finding the same terrain as the 14th Brigade.[17][d]\\r\\nThe 32nd Battalion on the eastern flank, suffered heavy casualties while attacking a German stronghold in the ruins of Delangre Farm. Elements of the 14th Brigade reached a main road 440 yards (400?m) south of the German line, before withdrawing to the ditch.[18] The Australian 8th and 14th Brigades had gained their objectives and captured about 1,100?yd (1,000?m) of the German front line.[9] A line was selected for consolidation and a strong-point built at the end of the Kastenweg, a German communication trench. Reinforcements with equipment and tools went forward and digging began on a communication trench across no man's land, as a German artillery barrage fell and all movement was fired on by machine-guns.[19]\\r\\nBy 7:00 p.m. accurate reports reached the 61st Division commander, Major-General C. J. Mackenzie of the success on the right and erroneous reports of limited success in the centre and a small lodgement on the Sugarloaf. Haking ordered Mackenzie at 7:30 p.m. to attack the Sugarloaf again to assist the Australians, before it was discovered that the 184th Brigade had not reached it. The 15th Australian Brigade was asked to co-operate with the British attack and the 58th Battalion was sent forward. A renewed bombardment continued as preparations were made to attack all along the front at 9:00 p.m., when at 8:20 p.m., Haking cancelled the attack and ordered that all troops were to be withdrawn after dark. Reinforcements for the 182nd Brigade received the order in time but the troops in the German line were overwhelmed, only a few wounded and stragglers returning. Troops pinned down in no man's land withdrew under cover of the bombardment and parties went out to rescue wounded. More discussion between Mackenzie and Haking led to a decision that the 184th Brigade would attack the Sugarloaf overnight, after a ten-minute hurricane bombardment; German shelling on the British front line then caused a postponement until the morning.[20]\\r\\nThe postponement failed to reach the 58th Australian Battalion, which attacked with some of the 59th Australian Battalion and was stopped in no man's land with many casualties, survivors from three battalions finding their way back after dark. Despite reinforcements, the situation of the 14th Australian Brigade troops in the German lines became desperate as artillery fire and German counter-attacks from the open right flank, forced a slow withdrawal in the dark. On the left flank, more troops were sent forward with ammunition to the 8th Australian Brigade at dusk and at 2:00 a.m. every soldier who could be found was sent forward. Consolidation in the German lines was slow as the troops lacked experience, many officers were casualties and there was no dry soil to fill sandbags, mud being substituted. German counter-attacks on the front and flanks, with machine-gun fire from Delangre Farm, De Mouquet Farm and The Tadpole, began at 3:15 a.m. on 20 July, forcing a retirement to the German first line and then a withdrawal to the original front line. During the withdrawals some troops managed to fight their way out but many were cut off and captured.[21]\\r\\nNews of the 8th Australian Brigade retirement reached McCay at a meeting with Mackenzie, Haking and Monro to plan the new 61st Division attack. Monro ordered the 14th Australian Brigade to be withdrawn and at 5:40 a.m. a box-barrage around the brigade began. At 7:50 a.m. the order to retire arrived, although it was not received by some parties. German troops had got well behind the right flank and fired at every sign of movement, forcing the Australians to withdraw along the communication trench dug overnight. By 9:00 a.m. the remnants of the 53rd, 54th and 55th battalions had returned; many wounded were rescued but only four of the machine-guns were recovered. Artillery-fire from both sides diminished and work began on either side of no man's land to repair defences; a short truce was arranged by the Germans and Australians to recover their wounded.[22]\\r\\nFrom 14 July the road from Illies to Beaucamps, 3?mi (4.8?km) behind the German front line was kept under air observation. On 16 July 16 Squadron joined 10 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps (RFC) on the attack front along with a kite balloon section, bringing the I Brigade squadrons of the RFC in support of the attack up to three corps squadrons and two army squadrons. The corps aircraft photographed and reconnoitred the area before the attack and flew artillery-observation and contact patrols during the battle.[e] Army squadrons flew further afield and denied German reconnaissance aircraft view of British troop movements, particularly behind the XI Corps front. On 19 July, aircraft from two squadrons patrolled the area towards Lille and had numerous air fights, in which two Fokkers and a British DH.2 were shot down. Bombing raids on German army billets, supply dumps and the railways from Lille to Lens, Douai, Cambrai and Valenciennes also took place.[24]\\r\\nOpposite the British right, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 17 lost a switch trench facing Trivelet and then a second line was overrun and the garrison was lost.[25] Troops of the left of III Battalion to the south of the Trivelet road bombed to its right and part of I Battalion attacked frontally and from the right, taking 61 prisoners.[26] On the Australian flank, III Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 21 was pushed back in the centre and on its right, forming a defensive flank at the Kastenweg and in front of Delangre Farm.[27] The right flank of III Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 16 repulsed the 15th Australian Brigade and was then reinforced by the II Battalion from Rue Delaval, which joined with the left of III Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 21. A counter-attack ordered by the divisional commander at 8:00 p.m., fell into confusion in the dark, under British artillery-fire and an attack on the 8th Australian Brigade, by part of I Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 21 was stopped by Australian small-arms fire. Later on, two other companies attacked up the Kastenweg as I Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 21 and half of Bavarian Reserve Regiment 20 attacked from the flank, reaching the old front line at 6:00 a.m. on 20 July. The right flank of the 14th Australian Brigade was counter-attacked by most of I Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 16, which joined the II Battalion and recaptured the front line step-by-step until dawn, when a pause was ordered due to exhaustion and lack of ammunition and grenades. When the attack resumed, the troops met those of Bavarian Reserve Regiment 21 at around 8:10 a.m.[22] German artillery support was less extensive than that available to the attackers but managed to \\"smother the British trenches with fire\\" as the artillery of the 50th Reserve Division and 54th Reserve Division fired from the flanks \\"thus the backbone of the British (sic) attack was broken before it left the trenches at 5:30 p.m.\\".[28]\\r\\nNeither division was well prepared for the attack; the 61st Division had disembarked in France in late May 1916, after delays in training caused by equipment shortages and the supplying of drafts to the 48th Division. The British entered the front line for the first time on 13 June and every man not part of the attack spent from 16 to 19 July removing poison gas cylinders from the front line when the discharge planned for 15 July was suspended due to the wind falling; 470 cylinders were removed before the work was stopped because the men were exhausted. The 5th Australian Division had arrived in France only days before the attack and had relieved the 4th Australian Division on the right flank of the Second Army by 12 July.[9] The Australian divisional artillery and some of the heavy artillery had no experience of Western Front conditions and as I Anzac Corps prepared to move south to the Somme front a considerable shuffling of divisions had taken place, which hampered preparations for the attack.[29]\\r\\nThe limited nature of the attack quickly became obvious to the German commanders. A German assessment of 16 December 1916, called the attack \\"operationally and tactically senseless\\" and prisoner interrogations revealed that the Australian troops were physically imposing but had \\"virtually no military discipline\\" and \\"no interest in soldiering as it was understood in Europe\\".[30] A German report on 30 July 1916, recorded that captured officers said that the Australians made a fundamental mistake in trying to hold the German second trench, rather than falling back to the front trench and consolidating. When the 15th Australian Brigade was pinned down in no man's land, the continuity of the attack broke down and lost protection against flanking fire from the right, which enabled German troops to counter-attack, regain the first trench and cut off the Australian troops further forward.[31]\\r\\nA communiqu, released to the press by British GHQ, was not favourably received by the Australians. \\"Yesterday evening, south of Armentires, we carried out some important raids on a front of two miles in which Australian troops took part. About 140 German prisoners were captured\\".[32] Australian losses, and doubts about the judgement of higher commanders, damaged relations between the AIF and the British, with further doubts about the reliability of British troops spreading in Australian units.[33] In 2008, Grey wrote that McCay also made errors in judgement that contributed to the result, citing McCay's order not to consolidate the initial gains and that poor planning, ineffective artillery support and Australian lack of experience of Western Front conditions, contributed to the failure.[9] A number of senior Australian officers were removed after the dbacle and the 5th Australian Division remained incapable of offensive action until late summer, when it began trench-raiding.[34] In October the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division, with morale high after the defensive success at Fromelles, was sent to the Somme front and never recovered from the ordeal; Bavarian Reserve Regiment 16 spent ten days in the line and lost 1,177 casualties.[35][f]\\r\\nIn 2012, Michael Senior wrote that the objective of the attack was contained in the First Army Operational Order 100 (15 July)\\r\\n...to prevent the enemy from moving troops Southwards, to take part in the main battle\\r\\nand that Haking had ordered that the troops due to attack were to be told that\\r\\nThe Commander in Chief [Haig] had directed XI Corps to attack the enemy in front of us, capture his front line system of trenches, and thus prevent him from reinforcing his troops to the South.\\r\\nSenior wrote that historians generally judged the attack to have failed to prevent German troops being moved south to the Somme, Wilfid Miles, the British official historian, writing that the IX Reserve and the Guard Reserve corps had been sent. Peter Pedersen wrote that the Germans knew that Fromelles was a decoy and sent the reserves to the Somme and in the Australian official history, Charles Bean wrote that the attack showed the Germans that they were free to withdraw troops. In 2007, Paul Cobb wrote that the Germans were not deterred from sending troops to reinforce the Somme. Senior wrote that there was evidence that the transfer of troops to the south was delayed. A German intelligence officer of the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division wrote on 20 July,\\r\\nThere are no signs of any immediate repetition of the enemy attack....However, judging by the general situation, a new push is not impossible.\\r\\nand a Bavarian document discovered in 1923 related that\\r\\nAn order was captured declaring that the object of the attack was to keep German troops engaged in the sector so as to keep pressure from the Somme...a repetition of these attacks is therefore to be expected.\\r\\nand Bean wrote in 1930 that the Bavarians might have doubted that the British would sacrifice 7,000 men as a decoy.[38]\\r\\nThe IX Reserve and Guard Reserve corps had been moved from the SouchezÿVimy area, 20?mi (32?km) from Fromelles, well outside the XI Corps sector. Troops kept in the LoosÿArmentires sector opposite the corps for four weeks after 19 July, were held back as a precaution. German records show that eight divisions were between Loos and Armentires on 1 July and that two were sent to the Somme by 2 July, long before the Fromelles attack and the other six divisions stayed opposite XI Corps for five to nine weeks after 19 July. Had divisions moved earlier, the Battle of Pozires (23 July ÿ 3 September), might have cost I Anzac Corps far more than the 23,000 casualties that it suffered. Senior concluded that German troops had been retained opposite the XI Corps because of the attack at Fromelles.[39]\\r\\nThe battle caused one of the greatest numbers of Australian deaths in action in 24 hours, surpassed only at the Battle of Bullecourt in 1917.[g] The 5th Australian Division lost 5,513 casualties, 2,000 men in the 8th Brigade, 1,776 men of the 15th Brigade, 1,717 men in the 14th Brigade and 88 men from the divisional engineers; two battalions had so many casualties that they had to be rebuilt. Of 887 personnel from the 60th Battalion, only one officer and 106 other ranks survived unwounded and the 32nd Battalion suffered 718 casualties. The 31st Battalion had 544 casualties and the 32nd Battalion lost 718 men killed and wounded.[41][42] The 61st Division was already under strength before the battle, engaged half as many men as the 5th Australian Division and lost 1,547 casualties. German casualties in the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division were 1,600ÿ2,000 men.[22] Allied soldiers killed in the area that was re-taken by the Germans, were buried shortly after the battle. The burial pits were photographed from a British reconnaissance aircraft on 21 July but marked as dugouts or trench-mortar positions. The bodies were taken by narrow gauge trench railway on 22 July and buried in eight 10?m G?2.2?m G?5?m (32.8?ft G?7.2?ft G?16.4?ft) pits.[43]\\r\\nMost war graves on the Western Front were discovered by official surveys during the 1920s; British and Empire dead were reburied in Imperial War Graves Commission cemeteries. 400 unknown Australian soldiers killed in the Battle of Fromelles were re-buried at the V.C. Corner Australian Cemetery and Memorial, 2-kilometre (1.2?mi) north-west of Fromelles (the only large exclusively Australian cemetery in France). Mortal remains of those killed in no man's land were recovered after the war and buried at V.C. Corner British Cemetery. In 2002, Lambis Englezos was inspired by Don't Forget Me Cobber (Corfield, 2000), to search for an unmarked mass grave near Fromelles. The site was found by Englezos and other researchers, near Fromelles at \\"le bois au fond du village\\", known as Fasanenw?ldchen (Pheasant Copse/Pheasant Wood) by the Germans.[h] The researchers believed that the pits had not been found after the war and gained support for an exploration of the site from the Australian Army and the British \\"All Party Parliamentary War Graves and Battlefield Heritage Group\\".[43][i]\\r\\nIn 2007, a geophysical survey was commissioned by the Australian government. The survey indicated that the pits had been undisturbed since the war and contained the remains of 337 soldiers. From 23 May ÿ 13 June 2008, an exploratory dig found human remains, personal effects, webbing, brass fitments, uniform badges, buttons and British .303 ammunition in five of six pits, which were then refilled.[45][j] Exhumations took place from May to September 2009, which recovered the mortal remains of 250 Allied soldiers, approximately 173 of whom were Australian, from which DNA samples were taken.[47][k][l] The original burial site was unsuitable and a new CWGC war cemetery was built about 120 metres (130?yd) away. On 30 January 2010, the first body was interred at Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery and the remaining bodies were buried in individual ceremonies, by the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers and the Australian Army.[50] In March 2010, it was reported that 75 Australian soldiers killed at Fromelles had been identified from DNA.[51] On 19 July 2010, the 94th anniversary of the battle, the last soldier (who remained unknown) was buried.[52] The cemetery was dedicated in a broadcast public ceremony.[53]\\r\\nThere are several memorials in the Fromelles area commemorating the battle. The V.C. Corner Australian Cemetery and Memorial was built in the early 1920s, the Australian Memorial Park opened in 1998 and the Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery was completed in 2010. There are other small cemeteries in the area with burials from the battle. In Fromelles Town Hall, there is a museum (Fromelles Weppes Terre de Mmoire), run by the Association pour le Souvenir de la Bataille de Fromelles (ASBF).[54] A new museum, the Musee de la Bataille de Fromelles is under construction. The plaque in it pays tribute to the pioneering work of Robin Corfield and Lambis Englezos in gaining wider attention to the battle and the loss of life of so many Australians, as well as British soldiers. The museum opened 2014 to coincide with the unveiling of some new headstones in the cemetery to mark other soldiers whose remains have been identified.[55]\\r\\nIn 2016, plans to hold a memorial event at the Pheasant Wood military cemetery were announced with the controversial decision to exclude British attendees from the ceremony. The move provoked anger amongst some families of the approximately 1,500 British casualties,\\r\\nFamilies feel totally insulted by the attitude of the Australian authorities. Men from both countries fought together and died together but now the Australians want to airbrush the British out of the battle.[56]\\r\\nIn response, the Australian Department of Veterans Affairs said that a decision has been made by the Australian Government to prioritise Australians and French,\\r\\nThis is not to diminish the role of other nations but simply a recognition of the Australian focus of the event we are organising.\\r\\nBooks\\r\\nNewspapers\\r\\nWebsites","input":"How many australian soldiers died in the battle of fromelles?"},{"output":"Gram-negative and enteric (normally found in the intestinal tract) bacilli","context":"MacConkey agar  is an indicator, a  selective and differential culture medium for bacteria designed to selectively isolate Gram-negative and enteric (normally found in the intestinal tract) bacilli and differentiate them based on lactose fermentation.[1] The crystal violet and bile salts inhibit the growth of gram-positive organisms which allows for the selection and isolation of gram-negative bacteria.

Different brands and models achieve this in different ways, but hydraulic speed control of each drive wheel is the most common method. Both commercial duty and homeowner models exist, with varying engine power options, size of cutting decks, fuel type (gasoline or diesel), and prices. A z-turn mower typically drives faster and costs more than a similarly sized conventional riding mower that has steerable front wheels.\\r\\nMost current models have four wheels: two small swiveling front tires and two large drive tires in the back. Bush Hog mowers sometimes come with a small, pivoting fifth wheel mounted in the center behind the driver. Instead of controlling the swiveling tires to steer the machine, the large drive tires rotate independently of each other based on the driver's input. They may rotate in opposite directions. The mower can pivot around a point midway between the drive wheels (the classic z-turn), or it can pivot around either one of the drive wheels if one is stationary, or it can turn in a circle of any radius. Reversal of the direction of travel can be accomplished by causing both wheels to rotate in reverse.\\r\\nSteering controls differ on z-turn mowers. Instead of a steering wheel, most z-turns have two throttles that control the rotational speed and direction of each drive wheel. The throttles are typically moved by a seated driver who operates levers mounted waist to shoulder high. The mower's engine throttle is controlled separately, if at all. Some zero turn mowers are steered by a joystick or a steering wheel, the advantage of either one being the location of the hands may permit less fatigue during prolonged mowing and the use of a single hand for steering.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1949, Warrensburg, MO resident Max Swisher invented the very first commercially available zero-turn mower and called it the \\"Ride King\\". It was a three-wheeled machine - one drive wheel in front and two in the rear. The patented system utilized the front wheel as the drive wheel that also was able to turn an amazing 360 degrees. The wheel was driven by the motor in the same direction 100% of the time. In order to reverse and/or utilize the zero turn capabilities, you simply turn the steering wheel 180 degrees and the mower would move in reverse. In 1963, John Regier was an employee of the Hesston Corporation, a manufacturer of farm and agricultural equipment. The company had recently engineered a device called the swather, which, propelled by a series of belts, cut hay, alfalfa and other farming materials and laid them out in windrows. The way the belts and pulleys operated allowed for counter- rotationa process which particularly struck Regier. An idea came to him one day: What if he could incorporate the same technology into lawnmowers?\\r\\n\\"So he went home and invented this thing that was able to operate on the zero-turn radius,\\" says Ken Raney, advertising manager at Hustler Turf. \\"He began selling them, but they werent really taking off the way he wanted them to. Nobody knew the technology then, so nobody wanted to buy it.\\" Regier's patent was eventually sold to Hesston, which would eventually become Excel Industriesparent company of Hustler Turf. The mower was calledappropriately enoughthe Hustler.\\r\\n\\"We were the first company to offer mowers with zero-turn technology,\\" says Paul Mullet, president of Excel Industries. \\"After Regier sold us the patent, he came to work for us and the rest is history.\\" Excel Industries is the parent company of Hustler Turf Equipment, Inc., which manufacturers Hustler Turf and BigDog Mowers zero-turn mowers.[1]\\r\\nIn 1969, Grasshopper Mowers introduced the first commercially viable zero-turn mower,[citation needed]and in 1974, Dixon coined the term \\"zero-turn radius\\" with their entrance into the mower market.[1]\\r\\nIn 1997, Robert D. Davis Jr. obtained United States Patent 5644903 for a new steering control he had invented for a zero turn radius mower, based on eight previous patents.[2][3]\\r\\nCurrently, there are more than three dozen zero-turn mower manufacturers offering a range of mid-mounted and out-front mowing deck options and accessories.\\r\\nFor most zero-turn mowers today, steering is simply changing the speeds of the drive tires, a method called differential steering. The tire speed is controlled by two levers that protrude on either side of the driver and typically extend over the lap (aka. lap bars). It is not that different from steering a shopping cart.[4] When both levers are pushed forward simultaneously with the same force, the mower moves forward; when both levers are pulled back simultaneously with the same force, the mower moves backward. Push one lever more than the other and the mower makes a gentle turn. Push one lever forward and pull the other back and the mower pivots from the drive wheels, creating a zero-radius turn.[5]\\r\\nZero-turn mowers can use steering wheels but must be designed much differently. Cub Cadet is one of the few zero-turns to use a steering wheel by connecting the back wheels to an axle. The axle is mounted in its midpoint to the body of the mower.[6]\\r\\nZero-turn mowers are designed to cut so closely around obstacles that there's virtually no need to trim. These mowers pivot through 180 degrees without leaving any uncut grass. Maximum lever movement means maximum fluid flow, which translates into a rapidly turning wheel. If one drive wheel turns more rapidly than the other, the machine moves along a curved path. If both wheels turn at the same speed, the machine follows a straight path. If one wheel stops and the other turns, or if the wheels turn in opposite directions, the mower pivots.[6] This drive system can be used on two different types of zero turn mowers, Mid Mount, where the mower is suspended under a 4 wheel chassis or Out Front, where the mower is terrain following and front mounted.The terrain following models provide a higher level of balance, comfort, safety and performance. The Out-front models utilise a centralised main drive wheel system with front and rear caster wheels. The midmount has front caster wheels and rear drive wheels. As both types use traction only as a steering system, care must be taken on any sloping terrain. Loss of traction causes total loss of steering.\\r\\nThere are a number of different attachments that add to the versatility of zero-turn mowers. One popular attachment is a bagging system that allows you to collect grass clippings. There are many bagger options available for zero turn mowers including two- and three-bucket designs. You can also add a mulching kit to the deck to mulch clippings back into the lawn instead of having the grass discharge from the side chute.\\r\\nAdding a hitch to the back of a zero turn mower allows use of a variety of different attachments, including a dump cart, spreader, plug aerator, lawn dethatcher, roller or sprayer. Some zero turn mowers also accommodate front-mounted attachments such as a snow blade, snow blower or brush for clearing snow or debris.[citation needed]","input":"Who built the first zero turn lawn mower?"},{"output":"a small force of Green Mountain Boys led by Ethan Allen and Colonel Benedict Arnold","context":"1 captured near Fort Saint-Jean[7]\\r\\nThe Capture of Fort Ticonderoga occurred during the American Revolutionary War on May 10, 1775, when a small force of Green Mountain Boys led by Ethan Allen and Colonel Benedict Arnold overcame a small British garrison at the fort and looted the personal belongings of the garrison. Cannons and other armaments from the fort were later transported to Boston and used to fortify Dorchester Heights and break the standoff at the Siege of Boston.\\r\\nAfter seizing Ticonderoga, a small detachment captured the nearby Fort Crown Point on May 11. Seven days later, Arnold and 50 men boldly raided Fort Saint-Jean on the Richelieu River in southern Quebec, seizing military supplies, cannons, and the largest military vessel on Lake Champlain.\\r\\nAlthough the scope of this military action was relatively minor, it had significant strategic importance. It impeded communication between northern and southern units of the British Army, and gave the nascent Continental Army a staging ground for the invasion of Quebec later in 1775. It also involved two larger-than-life personalities in Allen and Arnold, each of whom sought to gain as much credit and honor as possible for these events. Most significantly, artillery from Ticonderoga would be dragged across Massachusetts to the heights commanding Boston Harbor, forcing the British to withdraw from that city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1775, Fort Ticonderoga's location did not appear to be as strategically important as it had been in the French and Indian War, when the French famously defended it against a much larger British force in the 1758 Battle of Carillon, and when the British captured it in 1759. After the 1763 Treaty of Paris, in which the French ceded their North American territories to the British, the fort was no longer on the frontier of two great empires, guarding the principal waterway between them.[9] The French had blown up the fort's powder magazine when they abandoned the fort, and it had fallen further into disrepair since then. In 1775 it was garrisoned by only a small detachment of the 26th Regiment of Foot, consisting of two officers and forty-six men, with many of them \\"invalids\\" (soldiers with limited duties because of disability or illness). Twenty-five women and children lived there as well. Because of its former significance, Fort Ticonderoga still had a high reputation as the \\"gateway to the continent\\" or the \\"Gibraltar of America\\", but in 1775 it was, according to historian Christopher Ward, \\"more like a backwoods village than a fort.\\"[5]\\r\\nEven before shooting started in the American Revolutionary War, American Patriots were concerned about Fort Ticonderoga. The fort was a valuable asset for several reasons. Within its walls was a collection of heavy artillery including cannons, howitzers, and mortars, armaments that the Americans had in short supply.[10][11] The fort was situated on the shores of Lake Champlain, a strategically important route between the Thirteen Colonies and the British-controlled northern provinces. British forces placed there would expose the colonial forces in Boston to attack from the rear.[10] After the war began with the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, the British General Thomas Gage realized the fort would require fortification, and several colonists had the idea of capturing the fort.\\r\\nGage, writing from the besieged city of Boston following Lexington and Concord, instructed Quebec's governor, General Guy Carleton, to rehabilitate and refortify the forts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point.[12] Carleton did not receive this letter until May 19, well after the fort had been captured.[13]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold had frequently traveled through the area around the fort, and was familiar with its condition, manning, and armaments. En route to Boston following news of the events of April 19, he mentioned the fort and its condition to members of Silas Deane's militia.[14] The Connecticut Committee of Correspondence acted on this information; money was \\"borrowed\\" from the provincial coffers and recruiters were sent into northwestern Connecticut, western Massachusetts, and the New Hampshire Grants (now Vermont) to raise volunteers for an attack on the fort.[15]\\r\\nJohn Brown, an American spy from Pittsfield, Massachusetts who had carried correspondence between revolutionary committees in the Boston area and Patriot supporters in Montreal, was well aware of the fort and its strategic value.[9] Ethan Allen and other Patriots in the disputed New Hampshire Grants territory also recognized the fort's value, as it played a role in the dispute over that area between New York and New Hampshire.[16] Whether either took or instigated action prior to the Connecticut Colony's recruitment efforts is unclear. Brown had notified the Massachusetts Committee of Safety in March of his opinion that Ticonderoga \\"must be seized as soon as possible should hostilities be committed by the King's Troops.\\"[16][17]\\r\\nWhen Arnold arrived outside Boston, he told the Massachusetts Committee of Safety about the cannons and other military equipment at the lightly defended fort. On May 3, the Committee gave Arnold a colonel's commission and authorized him to command a \\"secret mission\\", which was to capture the fort.[18] He was issued S100, some gunpowder, ammunition, and horses, and instructed to recruit up to 400 men, march on the fort, and ship back to Massachusetts anything he thought useful.[19]\\r\\nArnold departed immediately after receiving his instructions. He was accompanied by two captains, Eleazer Oswald and Jonathan Brown, who were charged with recruiting the necessary men. Arnold reached the border between Massachusetts and the Grants on May 6, where he learned of the recruitment efforts of the Connecticut Committee, and that Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys were already on their way north. Riding furiously northward (his horse was subsequently destroyed), he reached Allen's headquarters in Bennington the next day.[20] Upon arrival, Arnold was told that Allen was in Castleton, 50 miles (80?km) to the north, awaiting supplies and more men. He was also warned that, although Allen's effort had no official sanction, his men were unlikely to serve under anyone else. Leaving early the next day, Arnold arrived in Castleton in time to join a war council, where he made a case to lead the expedition based on his formal authorization to act from the Massachusetts Committee.[21]\\r\\nThe force that Allen had assembled in Castleton included about 100 Green Mountain Boys, about 40 men raised by James Easton and John Brown at Pittsfield, and an additional 20 men from Connecticut.[22] Allen was elected colonel, with Easton and Seth Warner as his lieutenants.[21] When Arnold arrived on the scene, Samuel Herrick had already been sent to Skenesboro and Asa Douglas to Panton with detachments to secure boats. Captain Noah Phelps, a member of the \\"Committee of War for the Expedition against Ticonderoga and Crown Point\\", had reconnoitered the fort disguised as a peddler seeking a shave. He saw that the fort walls were dilapidated, learned from the garrison commander that the soldiers' gunpowder was wet, and that they expected reinforcements at any time.[23][24] He reported this intelligence to Allen, following which they planned a dawn raid.[23]\\r\\nMany of the Green Mountain Boys objected to Arnold's wish to command, insisting that they would go home rather than serve under anyone other than Ethan Allen. Arnold and Allen worked out an agreement, but no documented evidence exists concerning the deal. According to Arnold, he was given joint command of the operation. Some historians have supported Arnold's contention, while others suggest he was merely given the right to march next to Allen.[Note 1]\\r\\nBy 11:30?pm on May 9, the men had assembled at Hand's Cove (in what is now Shoreham, Vermont) and were ready to cross the lake to Ticonderoga. However, boats did not arrive until 1:30?am, and they were inadequate to carry the whole force.[25] Eighty-three of the Green Mountain Boys made the first crossing with Arnold and Allen, and Douglas went back for the rest.[2] As dawn approached, Allen and Arnold became fearful of losing the element of surprise, so they decided to attack with the men at hand. The only sentry on duty at the south gate fled his post after his musket misfired, and the Americans rushed into the fort. The Patriots then roused the small number of sleeping troops at gunpoint, and began confiscating their weapons. Allen, Arnold, and a few other men charged up the stairs toward the officers' quarters. Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham, assistant to Captain William Delaplace, was awakened by the noise, and called to wake the captain.[26] Stalling for time, Feltham demanded to know by what authority the fort was being entered. Allen, who later claimed that he said it to Captain Delaplace, replied, \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"[27] Delaplace finally emerged from his chambers (fully clothed, not with \\"his breeches in his hand\\", as Allen would later say) and surrendered his sword.[27]\\r\\nNobody was killed in the assault. The only injury was to one American, Gideon Warren,[28] who was slightly injured by a sentry with a bayonet.[8] Eventually, as many as 400 men arrived at the fort, which they plundered for liquor and other provisions. Arnold, whose authority was not recognized by the Green Mountain Boys, was unable to stop the plunder. Frustrated, he retired to the captain's quarters to await forces that he had recruited, reporting to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress that Allen and his men were \\"governing by whim and caprice\\" at the fort, and that the plan to strip the fort and send armaments to Boston was in peril.[29] When Delaplace protested the seizure of his private liquor stores, Allen issued him a receipt for the stores, which he later submitted to Connecticut for payment.[30] Arnold's disputes with Allen and his unruly men were severe enough that there were times when some of Allen's men drew weapons.[29]\\r\\nOn May 12, Allen sent the prisoners to Connecticut's Governor Jonathan Trumbull with a note saying \\"I make you a present of a Major, a Captain, and two Lieutenants of the regular Establishment of George the Third.\\"[31] Arnold busied himself over the next few days with cataloging the military equipment at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, a task made difficult by the fact that walls had collapsed on some of the armaments.[32]\\r\\nSeth Warner sailed a detachment up the lake and captured nearby Fort Crown Point, garrisoned by only nine men. It is widely recorded that this capture occurred on May 10; this is attributed to a letter Arnold wrote to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety on May 11, claiming that an attempt to sail up to Crown Point was frustrated by headwinds. However Warner claimed, in a letter dated May 12 from \\"Head Quarters, Crown Point\\", that he \\"took possession of this garrison\\" the day before.[6] It appears likely that, having failed on May 10, the attempt was repeated the next day with success, as reported in Warner's memoir.[33] A small force was also sent to capture Fort George on Lake George, which was held by only two soldiers.[34]\\r\\nTroops recruited by Arnold's captains began to arrive, some after seizing Philip Skene's schooner Katherine and several bateaux at Skenesboro.[35][36] Arnold rechristened the schooner Liberty. The prisoners had reported that the lone British warship on Lake Champlain was at Fort Saint-Jean, on the Richelieu River north of the lake. Arnold, uncertain whether word of Ticonderoga's capture had reached Saint-Jean, decided to attempt a raid to capture the ship. He had Liberty outfitted with guns, and sailed north with 50 of his men on May 14.[37] Allen, not wanting Arnold to get the full glory for that capture, followed with some of his men in bateaux, but Arnold's small fleet had the advantage of sail, and pulled away from Allen's boats. By May 17, Arnold's small fleet was at the northern end of the lake. Seeking intelligence, Arnold sent a man to reconnoiter the situation at Fort Saint-Jean. The scout returned later that day, reporting that the British were aware of the fall of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and that troops were apparently on the move toward Saint-Jean. Arnold decided to act immediately.[38]\\r\\nRowing all night, Arnold and 35 of his men brought their bateaux near the fort. After a brief scouting excursion, they surprised the small garrison at the fort, and seized supplies there, along with the HMS?Royal George, a seventy-ton sloop-of-war.[39] Warned by their captives that several companies were on their way from Chambly, they loaded the more valuable supplies and cannons on the George, which Arnold renamed the Enterprise. Boats that they could not take were sunk, and the enlarged fleet returned to Lake Champlain.[4] This activity was observed by Moses Hazen, a retired British officer who lived near the fort. Hazen rode to Montreal to report the action to the local military commander, and then continued on to Quebec City, where he reported the news to General Carleton on May 20. Major Charles Preston and 140 men were immediately dispatched from Montreal to Saint-Jean in response to Hazen's warning.[40]\\r\\nFifteen miles out on the lake, Arnold's fleet met Allen's, which was still heading north. After an exchange of celebratory gunfire, Arnold opened his stores to feed Allen's men, who had rowed 100 miles (160?km) in open boats without provisions. Allen, believing he could seize and hold Fort Saint-Jean, continued north, while Arnold sailed south.[41] Allen arrived at Saint-Jean on May 19, where he was warned that British troops were approaching by a sympathetic Montreal merchant who had raced ahead of those troops on horseback.[42] Allen, after penning a message for the merchant to deliver to the citizens of Montreal, returned to Ticonderoga on May 21, leaving Saint-Jean just as the British forces arrived.[42][43] In their haste to escape the British, three men were left behind; one was captured, but the other two eventually returned south by land.[7]\\r\\nEthan Allen and his men eventually drifted away from Ticonderoga, especially once the alcohol began to run out, and Arnold largely controlled affairs from a base at Crown Point.[34][44] He oversaw the fitting of the two large ships, eventually taking command of Enterprise because of a lack of knowledgeable seamen. His men began rebuilding Ticonderoga's barracks, and worked to extract armaments from the rubble of the two forts and build gun carriages for them.[44]\\r\\nConnecticut sent about 1,000 men under Colonel Benjamin Hinman to hold Ticonderoga, and New York also began to raise militia to defend Crown Point and Ticonderoga against a possible British attack from the north. When Hinman's troops arrived in June, there was once again a clash over leadership. None of the communications to Arnold from the Massachusetts committee indicated that he was to serve under Hinman; when Hinman attempted to assert authority over Crown Point, Arnold refused to accept it, as Hinman's instructions only included Ticonderoga.[45] The Massachusetts committee eventually sent a delegation to Ticonderoga. When they arrived on June 22 they made it clear to Arnold that he was to serve under Hinman. Arnold, after considering for two days, disbanded his command, resigned his commission, and went home, having spent more than S1,000 of his own money in the effort to capture the fort.[46]\\r\\nWhen Congress received news of the events, it drafted a second letter to the inhabitants of Quebec, which was sent north in June with James Price, another sympathetic Montreal merchant. This letter, and other communications from the New York Congress, combined with the activities of vocal American supporters, stirred up the Quebec population in the summer of 1775.[47]\\r\\nWhen news of the fall of Ticonderoga reached England, Lord Dartmouth wrote that it was \\"very unfortunate; very unfortunate indeed\\".[48]\\r\\nNews of the capture of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and especially the raids on Fort Saint-Jean, electrified the Quebec population. Colonel Dudley Templer, in charge of the garrison at Montreal, issued a call on May 19 to raise a militia for defense of the city, and requested Indians living nearby to also take up arms. Only 50 men, mostly French-speaking landowning seigneurs and petty nobility, were raised in and around Montreal, and they were sent to Saint-Jean; no Indians came to their aid. Templer also prevented merchants sympathetic to the American cause from sending supplies south in response to Allen's letter.[49]\\r\\nGeneral Carleton, notified by Hazen of the events on May 20, immediately ordered the garrisons of Montreal and Trois-Rivires to fortify Saint-Jean. Some troops garrisoned at Quebec were also sent to Saint-Jean. Most of the remaining Quebec troops were dispatched to a variety of other points along the Saint Lawrence, as far west as Oswegatchie, to guard against potential invasion threats.[50] Carleton then traveled to Montreal to oversee the defense of the province from there, leaving the city of Quebec in the hands of Lieutenant Governor Hector Cramah.[51] Before leaving, Carleton prevailed on Monsignor Jean-Olivier Briand, the Bishop of Quebec, to issue his own call to arms in support of the provincial defense, which was circulated primarily in the areas around Montreal and Trois-Rivires.[52]\\r\\nIn July 1775, General Philip Schuyler began using the fort as the staging ground for the invasion of Quebec that was launched in late August.[53] In the winter of 1775ÿ1776, Henry Knox directed the transportation of the guns of Ticonderoga to Boston. The guns were placed upon Dorchester Heights overlooking the besieged city and the British ships in the harbor, prompting the British to evacuate their troops and Loyalist supporters from the city in March 1776.[54]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold again led a fleet of ships at the Battle of Valcour Island, and played other key roles in thwarting Britain's attempt to recapture the fort in 1776.[55] The British did recapture the fort in July 1777 during the Saratoga campaign, but had abandoned it by November after Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga.[56]\\r\\nAlthough Fort Ticonderoga was not at the time an important military post, its capture had several important results. Rebel control of the area meant that overland communications and supply lines between British forces in Quebec and those in Boston and later New York were severed, so the British military command made an adjustment to their command structure.[57] This break in communication was highlighted by the fact that Arnold, on his way north to Saint-Jean, intercepted a message from Carleton to Gage, detailing the military troop strengths in Quebec.[58] Command of British forces in North America, previously under a single commander, was divided into two commands. General Carleton was given independent command of forces in Quebec and the northern frontier, while General William Howe was appointed Commander-in-Chief of forces along the Atlantic coast, an arrangement that had worked well between Generals Wolfe and Amherst in the French and Indian War.[57] In this war, however, cooperation between the two forces would prove to be problematic and would play a role in the failure of the Saratoga campaign in 1777, as General Howe apparently abandoned an agreed-upon northern strategy, leaving General John Burgoyne without southern support in that campaign.[59]\\r\\nBeginning on the day of the fort's capture, Allen and Arnold began a war of words, each attempting to garner for himself as much credit for the operation as possible. Arnold, unable to exert any authority over Allen and his men, began to keep a diary of events and actions, which was highly critical and dismissive of Allen.[34] Allen, in the days immediately after the action, also began to work on a memoir. Published several years later (see Further reading), the memoir fails to mention Arnold at all. Allen also wrote several versions of the events, which John Brown and James Easton brought to a variety of Congresses and committees in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Randall (1990) claims that Easton took accounts written by both Arnold and Allen to the Massachusetts committee, but conveniently lost Arnold's account on the way, ensuring that Allen's version, which greatly glorified his role in the affair, would be preferred.[60] Smith (1907) indicates that it was highly likely that Easton was interested in claiming Arnold's command for himself.[61] There was clearly no love lost between Easton and Arnold. Allen and Easton returned to Crown Point on June 10 and called a council of war while Arnold was with the fleet on the lake, a clear breach of military protocol. When Arnold, whose men now dominated the garrison, asserted his authority, Easton insulted Arnold, who responded by challenging Easton to a duel. Arnold later reported, \\"On refusing to draw like a gentleman, he having a [sword] by his side and cases of loaded pistols in his pockets, I kicked him very heartily and ordered him from the Point.\\"[62]","input":"Who won the battle of fort ticonderoga 1775?"},{"output":"The Metric system","context":"A number of units of measurement were used in Mexico to measure length, mass, area, capacity, etc. The Metric system was optional from 1857, and has been compulsory since 1896.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Units of the system (from Spanish, Castillian) were legally defined during the transition period of the metric system.[1]\\r\\nA number of units were used.

A bridesmaid is typically a young woman, and often a close friend or relative. She attends to the bride on the day of a wedding or marriage ceremony. Traditionally, bridesmaids were chosen from unwed young women of marriageable age.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal bridesmaid, if one is so designated, may be called the chief bridesmaid or maid of honor if she is unmarried, or the matron of honor if she is married. A junior bridesmaid is a girl who is clearly too young to be married, but who is included as an honorary bridesmaid. In the United States, typically only the maid/matron of honor and the best man are the official witnesses for the wedding license.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften there is more than one bridesmaid: in modern times the bride chooses how many to ask. Historically, no person of status went out unattended, and the size of the retinue was closely calculated to be appropriate to the family's social status. A large group of bridesmaids provided an opportunity for showing off the family's social status and wealth. Today, the number of bridesmaids in a wedding party is dependent on many variables, including a bride's preferences, the size of her family, and the number of attendants her partner would like to have as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male equivalent is the groomsman, also known in British English as an usher; in the United States, the role of attending to the groom has diverged from that of escorting guests to their seats, and the two positions are no longer synonymous and are often if not usually filled by different persons.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some cultures, such as in Norway, the Netherlands and Victorian Britain, it has been customary for bridesmaids to be small girls rather than grown women. They may carry flowers during the wedding procession and pose with the married couple in bridal photos. In modern English-speaking countries, this role is separate from that of the bridesmaid, and the small child performing it is known as a flower girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough many exceed the minimum, the bridesmaids' required duties are very limited.[1] They are required to attend the wedding ceremony and to assist the bride on the day of the wedding. Bridesmaids in Europe and North America are often asked to assist the bride with planning the wedding and a wedding reception. In modern times, a bridesmaid often participates in planning wedding-related events, such as a bridal shower or bachelorette party, if there are any. These, however, are optional activities; according to etiquette expert Judith Martin, \\"Contrary to rumor, bridesmaids are not obliged to entertain in honor of the bride, nor to wear dresses they cannot afford.\\"[2] If it is customary in the bride's area to have a bridesmaids luncheon, then it is hosted, and therefore organized and paid for, by the bride.[3] A junior bridesmaid has no responsibilities beyond attending the wedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe duties and costs of being a bridesmaid are parsed out between a bride and her attendants in a variety of ways. Since modern bridesmaids, unlike their historical counterparts, can no longer rely on having their clothes and travel expenses paid for by the bride's family, and are sometimes even told they must pay for parties that the bride wants to have before the wedding, it has become customary for the bride to present the bridesmaids with gifts as a sign of gratitude for the support and financial commitment that comes with their roles. It has become equally customary for women who are invited to serve as bridesmaids to first ask about the amount of time, energy, and money that the bride expects from them before accepting this position, and to decline or resign if this is more than they will be able to give.[4] In some American weddings, each bridesmaid may be asked to spend US $1,700 or more, with travel to destination weddings and pre-wedding parties usually being the biggest expense.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome bridesmaids have particular duties. For instance, the mead of honor is to provide a constant source of fortified honey drink, to keep the bridal party festive. And the made of on her has, diplomatically, important romantic duties vis-a-vis the bride's friends and family.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the term \\"maid of honour\\" originally referred to the female attendant of a queen. The term bridesmaid is normally used for all bridal attendants in the UK. However, when the attendant is married, or is a mature woman, the term matron of honour is often used. The influence of American English has led to the chief bridesmaid sometimes being called the maid of honour.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn North America, a wedding party might include several bridesmaids, but the maid of honor is the title and position held by the bride's chief attendant, typically her closest friend or sister. In modern-day weddings some brides opt to choose a long-time male friend or brother as their head attendant, using the title best man or man of honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe activities of the principal bridesmaid may be as many or as varied as she allows the bride to impose upon her. Her only required duty is to participate in the wedding ceremony. Typically, however, she is asked for help with the logistics of the wedding as an event, such as addressing invitations, and for her help as a friend, such as attending the bride as she shops for her wedding dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day of the wedding, her principal duty is to provide practical and emotional support. She might assist the bride with dressing and, if needed, help the bride manage her veil, a bouquet, a prayer book, or the train of her wedding dress during the day. In a double-ring wedding, the chief bridesmaid is often entrusted with the groom's wedding ring until it is needed during the ceremony. Many brides ask bridesmaids if they are adults, to be legal witnesses who sign the marriage license after the ceremony. If there is a reception after the wedding, the maid of honor may be asked to offer a toast to the newlywed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of the Western bridesmaid tradition likely arose from a combination of many factors. The most-likely factors include, but aren't limited to, socioeconomic class and status, family size, socialization standards of the day, and religion.\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers cite the Biblical story of Jacob, and his two wives Leah and Rachel, who both literally came with their own maids as detailed in the Book of Genesis (29:24, 46:18) as the origin of bridesmaids. These women were handmaidens (servants or slaves) instead of social peers.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome sources state that, in ancient times, originally the bride and all the bridesmaids wore the exact same dress and veiled their faces heavily, for the purpose of confusing jealous suitors and evil spirits.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn China during the feudal era, the female womb was seen as precious for the production of an heir. Brides were susceptible to kidnapping at weddings by rival clans and hooligans. Shouldering the responsibility to protect the bride, bridesmaids were dressed up like the bride to lower the risk that she might be identified and robbed. As legal protections for marriage were established, this was no longer necessary, and the role of bridesmaid took a more symbolic turn.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Victorian era, white was the official color for both male groomsmen and female bridesmaids. This trend originated with Queen Victoria when she married Prince Albert wearing a long white wedding dress, and her bridesmaids matched the color of her gown.\\r\\n\\r\\n Media related to Bridesmaids at Wikimedia Commons","input":"How old do you have to be to be a chief bridesmaid?"},{"output":"Manhattan","context":"New York City encompasses five different county-level administrative divisions called boroughs: Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island. All boroughs are part of New York City, and each of the boroughs is coextensive with a respective county, the primary administrative subdivision within New York State. The Bronx and Queens are concurrent with the counties of the same name, while Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island correspond to New York, Kings, and Richmond Counties respectively.\\r\\nBoroughs have existed since the consolidation of the city in 1898, when the city and each borough assumed their current boundaries. However, the boroughs have not always been coextensive with their respective counties. Before 1914, the borough of The Bronx had been earlier in the southern part of Westchester County which had then been annexed to New York County in two stages in 1874 and 1895finally, in 1914 the county was created to match the borough. Before 1899, the County of Queens included an eastern part, which was split-off during the consolidation to become Nassau County.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term borough was adopted to describe a form of governmental administration for each of the five fundamental constituent parts of the newly consolidated city in 1898. Under the 1898 City Charter adopted by the New York State Legislature, a \\"borough\\" is a municipal corporation that is created when a county is merged with populated areas within it.[1] The limited powers of the borough governments are inferior to the authority of the Government of New York City, contrasting significantly with other borough administrations of government used in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, where a borough is an independent level of government, as well as borough forms used in other states and in Greater London.[2]\\r\\nNew York City is often referred to collectively as the five boroughs; the term is used to refer to New York City as a whole unambiguously, avoiding confusion with any particular borough or with the Greater New York metropolitan area. The term is also used by politicians to counter a frequent focus on Manhattan and thereby to place all five boroughs on equal footing. In the same vein, the term outer boroughs refers to all of the boroughs excluding Manhattan, even though the geographic center of the city is along the BrooklynÿQueens border. All five boroughs were created in 1898 during consolidation, when the city's current boundaries were established.\\r\\nThe Bronx originally included parts of New York County outside of Manhattan that had previously been ceded by neighboring Westchester County in two stages; in 1874 and then following a referendum in 1894. Ultimately in 1914, the present-day separate Bronx County became the last county to be created in the State of New York.\\r\\nThe borough of Queens consists of what formerly was only the western part of a then-larger Queens County. In 1899, the three eastern towns of Queens County that had not joined the city the year beforethe towns of Hempstead, North Hempstead, and Oyster Bayformally seceded from Queens County to form the new Nassau County.[4]\\r\\nThe borough of Staten Island, concurrent with Richmond County, was officially the borough of Richmond until the name was changed in 1975 to reflect its common appellation, while leaving the name of the county unchanged.[5]\\r\\nThere are hundreds of distinct neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs of New York City, many with a definable history and character to call their own.\\r\\nSince 1914, each of New York City's five boroughs has been coextensive with a county of New York State ÿ unlike most U.S. cities, which lie within a single county or extend partially into another county, constitute a county in themselves, or are completely separate and independent of any county.\\r\\nEach borough is represented by a borough president. Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island each have a Borough Hall with limited administrative functions. The Manhattan Borough President's office is situated in the Manhattan Municipal Building. The Bronx Borough President's office used to be in its own Bronx Borough Hall but has been in the Bronx County Courthouse for decades. Since the abolition of the Board of Estimate in 1990 (due to a 1989 ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court[26]), the borough presidents have minimal executive powers, and there is no legislative function within a borough. Executive functions in New York City are the responsibility of the Mayor of New York City, while legislative functions reside with the New York City Council. The borough presidents primarily act as spokesmen, advocates, and ceremonial leaders for their boroughs, have budgets from which they can allocate relatively modest sums of money to community organizations and projects, and appoint the members of the 59 largely advisory community boards in the city's various neighborhoods. The Brooklyn and Queens borough presidents also appoint trustees to the local public library systems in those boroughs.\\r\\nBeing coextensive with an individual county, each borough also elects a district attorney, as does every other county of New York State. While the district attorneys of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island are popularly referred to as such by the media (e.g., \\"Manhattan D.A. Cyrus Vance, Jr.\\", or \\"Brooklyn D.A. Kenneth P. Thompson\\"), they are technically and legally the district attorneys of New York County, Kings County and Richmond County, respectively. There is no such distinction made for the district attorneys of the other two counties, Queens and the Bronx, since these boroughs share the respective counties' names. Because the five district attorneys are, technically speaking, state officials (since the counties are considered to be arms of the state government), rather than officials of the city government, they are not subject to the term limitations that govern other New York City officials such as the mayor, the New York City Public Advocate, members of the city council, or the borough presidents. Some civil court judges also are elected on a borough-wide basis, although they generally are eligible to serve throughout the city.\\r\\nThe term sixth borough is used to describe any of a number of places that have been metaphorically called a part of New York City because of their geographic location, demographics (they include large numbers of former New Yorkers), special affiliation, or cosmopolitan character. They have included adjacent cities and counties in the New York metropolitan area as well as in other states, U.S. territories, and foreign countries.[27][28][29] In 2011, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg referred to the city's waterfront and waterways as a composite sixth borough during presentations of planned rehabilitation projects along the city's shoreline,[30][31][32][33][34][35] including Governor's Island in the Upper New York Bay.[36] The Hudson Waterfront in the U.S. state of New Jersey lies opposite Manhattan on the Hudson River, and during the Dutch colonial era, was under the jurisdiction of New Amsterdam and known as Bergen. Jersey City and Hoboken in Hudson County, New Jersey, are sometimes referred to as the sixth borough, given their proximity and connections by rapid transit PATH trains.[37][38][39][40] Fort Lee, New Jersey, in Bergen County, opposite Upper Manhattan and connected by the George Washington Bridge, has also been called the sixth borough.[41][42][43] Miami and nearby areas in Florida,[44][45] Philadelphia[46] and China[47] are locales entirely outside the city's metropolitan area which have been called New York City's sixth borough.","input":"What are all the boroughs in new york?"},{"output":"September 1995","context":"The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, recognizes and archives the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the Hall of Fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" ÿ part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor ÿ has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than $1.8 billion.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFounder Ahmet Ertegun assembled a team that included attorney Suzan Evans, Rolling Stone magazine editor and publisher Jann S. Wenner, attorney Allen Grubman, and record executives Seymour Stein, Bob Krasnow, and Noreen Woods. The Foundation began inducting artists in 1986, but the Hall of Fame still had no home. The search committee considered several cities, including Philadelphia (home of Bill Haley and American Bandstand), Memphis (home of Sun Studios and Stax Records), Detroit (home of Motown Records), Cincinnati (home of King Records), New York City, and Cleveland.[citation needed]\\r\\nCleveland lobbied for the museum, citing that WJW disc jockey Alan Freed both coined the term \\"rock and roll\\" and heavily promoted the new genreand that Cleveland was the location of Freed's Moondog Coronation Ball, the first major rock and roll concert. In addition, Cleveland cited radio station WMMS, which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S. during the 1970s and 80s, including artist David Bowie, who began his first U.S. tour in the city, Bruce Springsteen, Roxy Music, and Rush among many others.[4] Cleveland was also one of the premier tour stops for most rock bands.\\r\\nCivic leaders in Cleveland pledged $65 million in public money to fund the construction. A petition drive was signed by 600,000 fans favoring Cleveland over Memphis, and Cleveland ranked first in a 1986 USA Today poll asking where the Hall of Fame should be located. On May 5, 1986, the Hall of Fame Foundation chose Cleveland as the permanent home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Sam Phillips of Sun Studios fame and many others were stunned and disappointed that it ended up in Cleveland. \\"The hall of fame should've been in Memphis, certainly,\\" wrote Peter Guralnick, author of an acclaimed two-volume Elvis Presley biography.[5]\\r\\nCleveland may also have been chosen as the organization's site because the city offered the best financial package. As The Plain Dealer music critic Michael Norman noted, \\"It was $65 million... Cleveland wanted it here and put up the money.\\" Co-founder Jann Wenner later said, \\"One of the small sad things is we didn't do it in New York in the first place,\\" but then added, \\"I am absolutely delighted that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is in Cleveland.\\"\\r\\nDuring early discussions on where to build the Hall of Fame and Museum, the Foundation's board considered the Cuyahoga River. Ultimately, the chosen location was along East Ninth Street in downtown Cleveland by Lake Erie, east of Cleveland Stadium.\\r\\nAt one point in the planning phase when a financing gap existed, planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then-vacant May Company Building, but finally decided to commission architect I. M. Pei to design a new building. Initial CEO Dr. Larry R. Thompson facilitated I. M. Pei in designs for the site. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. The museum tower was initially planned to stand 200?ft (61 m) high, but had to be cut down to 162?ft (49 m) due to its proximity to Burke Lakefront Airport. The building's base is approximately 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2). The groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 7, 1993. Pete Townshend, Chuck Berry, Billy Joel, Sam Phillips, Ruth Brown, Sam Moore of Sam and Dave, Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum all appeared at the groundbreaking.\\r\\nThe museum was dedicated on September 1, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included Yoko Ono and Little Richard, among others, before a crowd of more than 10,000 people. The following night an all-star concert was held at the stadium. It featured Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Al Green, Jerry Lee Lewis, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Iggy Pop, John Fogerty, John Mellencamp, and many others.\\r\\nIn addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit located in a wing that juts out over Lake Erie.[6]\\r\\nSince 1986, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has selected new inductees. The formal induction ceremony has been held in New York City 26 times (1986ÿ92, 1994ÿ96, 1998ÿ2008, 2010ÿ11, 2014, 2016, and 2017); twice in Los Angeles (1993 and 2013); and four times in the Hall of Fame's home in Cleveland (1997, 2009, 2012, and 2015). Beginning in 2018, the induction ceremonies will alternate each year between Cleveland and New York.[7]\\r\\nThe 2009 and 2012 induction weeks were made possible by a publicÿprivate partnership between the City of Cleveland, the State of Ohio, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and local foundations, corporations, civic organizations and individuals. Collectively these entities invested $5.8 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2012 to produce a week of events, including free concerts, a gospel celebration, exhibition openings, free admission to the museum, and induction ceremonies filled with both fans and VIPs at Public Hall.[8]\\r\\nMillions viewed the television broadcast of the Cleveland inductions; tens of thousands traveled to Ohio during induction week to participate in Induction-related events. The economic impact of the 2009 induction week activities was more than $13 million, and it provided an additional $20 million in media exposure for the region. The 2012 induction week yielded similar results.[9]\\r\\nThere are seven levels in the building. On the lower level is the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall, the museum's main gallery. It includes exhibits on the roots of rock and roll (gospel, blues, rhythm & blues and folk, country and bluegrass). It also features exhibits on cities that have had a major impact on rock and roll: Memphis, Detroit, London and Liverpool, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle. There are exhibits about soul music, the Fifties, Sun Records, Atlantic Records, hip hop music, Cleveland's rock and roll legacy, the music of the Midwest, rock and roll radio and dee-jays, and the many protests against rock and roll. This gallery also has exhibits that focus on individual artists, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and others. Finally, the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall includes two theaters, one of which features a film about the roots of rock and roll and one that features films on various subjects.[10]\\r\\nThe first floor of the museum is the entrance level. It includes a cafe, a stage that the museum uses for various special performances and events throughout the year, and a section called \\"Backstage Stories.\\" The second floor includes several interactive kiosks that feature programs on one-hit wonders and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. This level also includes a gallery with artifact-filled exhibits about Les Paul, Alan Freed, Sam Phillips and the evolution of audio technology.[11]\\r\\nVisitors enter the Hall of Fame section of the museum on the third floor. This section includes \\"The Power of Rock Experience,\\" which includes one of Jonathan Demme's final works, a film shown in the Connor Theater. The film includes musical highlights from some of the Hall's induction ceremonies.[12] Visitors exit the Hall of Fame section on the fourth floor. That level features the Foster Theater, a state-of-the-art 3-D theater that is used for special events and programs.[13][14]\\r\\nFinally, the top two levels of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame feature large, temporary exhibits. Over the years, numerous exhibits have been installed on these two levels, including exhibits about Elvis Presley, hip-hop, the Supremes, the Who, U2, John Lennon, the Clash, Bruce Springsteen, Women Who Rock, and the Rolling Stones.\\r\\nDesigned by I. M. Pei, and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the building rises above the shores of Lake Erie. It is a combination of bold geometric forms and dynamic cantilevered spaces that are anchored by a 162-foot tower. The tower supports a dual-triangular-shaped glass \\"tent\\" that extends (at its base) onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza that provides a main entry facade.\\r\\nThe building houses more than 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, as well as administrative offices, a store, and a caf.\\r\\n\\"In designing this building,\\" Pei said, \\"it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of Cleveland and for fans of rock and roll around the world.\\" [15]\\r\\nSince 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has featured numerous temporary exhibits that range in size from major exhibits that fill the top two floors of the museum to smaller exhibits that are often installed in the main exhibition hall on the lower level.\\r\\nThe museum's first major exhibit opened on May 10, 1997. It was called I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era, 1965 ÿ 1969. It included artifacts from numerous artists, including John Lennon, Eric Clapton, John Sebastian, the Jefferson Airplane, and Janis Joplin, as well as artifacts related to the Monterey International Pop Festival and Woodstock.\\r\\nThat exhibit was followed by Elvis is in the Building, an exhibit about the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\", which ran from August 8, 1998, to September 5, 1999. This year-long tribute was the first ever special exhibit devoted to a single artist, Elvis Presley, the first inductee into the RRHOF in 1986. Graceland supplied a significant selection of representative artifacts for this special tribute spanning Elvis' life and legendary career. (see Larry G. Keeter, \\"Elvis Is In the Building,\\" \\"Elvis International Forum,\\" Summer 2000, pp.?28ÿ29) Next, the museum curated Roots, Rhymes and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story. That was the first major museum exhibit to focus on hip-hop. It ran from November 11, 1999, to August 6, 2000. It was followed by Rock Style, an exhibit that focused on rock and roll and fashion. It featured clothing from Buddy Holly to Alice Cooper, from Ray Charles to David Bowie and from Smokey Robinson to Sly Stone. After it closed in Cleveland, Rock Style traveled to other museums in the U.S.\\r\\nOther temporary exhibits have included Lennon: His Life and Work, which ran from October 20, 2000, to January 1, 2003. It was followed by In the Name of Love: Two Decades of U2 and then Reflections: The Mary Wilson Supreme Legacy Collection. A major exhibition on display during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016 was Louder than Words: Rock, Power, Politics.[16]\\r\\nOther large temporary exhibits have focused on the Clash (Revolution Rock: The Story of the Clash), the Doors (Break on Through: The Lasting Legacy of the Doors), the Who's Tommy (Tommy: The Amazing Journey), and Bruce Springsteen (From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen). Another thematic temporary exhibit focused on the role of women in rock and roll (Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power). Many of these exhibits travel to other museums after closing in Cleveland. The museum's current major temporary exhibit is about the history of the magazine Rolling Stone.[17]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also curates many smaller temporary exhibits. Over the years, these exhibits have focused on such topics as the Vans Warped Tour, the Concert for Bangladesh, Woodstock's 40th anniversary, Austin City Limits, the Monterey International Pop Festival, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Marty Stuart, Paul Simon, Graham Nash, and John Mellencamp.\\r\\nThe museum also devotes exhibits to photography and artwork related to rock and roll. Among the photographers whose work has been featured at the Hall of Fame are George Kalinsky, Alfred Wertheimer, Tommy Edwards, Kevin Mazur, Janet Macoska, Lynn Goldsmith, Mike McCartney, Robert Alford,[18] and George Shuba. The museum also featured the artwork of Philip Burke in one of its temporary exhibits, and a later exhibit featured Herb Ritts.[19][20]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll. Every February, the museum celebrates Black History Month[21] by hosting concerts, film screenings and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll. Since the program began in 1996, such artists as Robert Lockwood, Jr., the Temptations, Charles Brown, Ruth Brown, the Ohio Players, Lloyd Price, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and Al Green have appeared at the museum during Black History Month.\\r\\nAnother program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in a rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum's Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. Among the inductees who have taken part in this series are Darryl \\"DMC\\" McDaniels of Run-D.M.C., Lloyd Price, Marky Ramone, Seymour Stein, Ray Manzarek of the Doors, Ronnie Spector, Bootsy Collins, Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, and Jorma Kaukonen of the Jefferson Airplane.\\r\\nA similar program is the Legends Series. The only real difference between this program and the Hall of Fame Series is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Peter Hook of Joy Division, Spinderella of Salt n Pepa, Tommy James, and the Chi-Lites are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series.\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year the museum celebrates one of the Hall's inductees with a week-long series of programs that include interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artists, from Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians.\\r\\nThe American Music Masters series began in 1996 with Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger. Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: Jimmie Rodgers (1997), Robert Johnson (1998), Louis Jordan (1999), Muddy Waters (2000), Bessie Smith (2001), Hank Williams (2002), Buddy Holly (2003), Lead Belly (2004), Sam Cooke (2005), Roy Orbison (2006), Jerry Lee Lewis (2007), Les Paul (2008),[22] Janis Joplin (2009),[23] Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew (2010), Aretha Franklin (2011),[24] and Chuck Berry (2012).[25]\\r\\nHall of Fame museum curator James Henke, along with \\"the museum's curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts\\", created an unordered list of \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\".[26][27] The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995.[28] It contains songs recorded from the 1920s through the 1990s. The Beatles with seven songs was the most represented on the 500ÿsong list. The oldest song on the list is \\"Wabash Cannonball\\", written circa 1882 and credited to J. A. Roff. Since then, however, an additional 155 songs have been added, and the list is now simply referred to as \\"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.\\" The most recent songs on the list are Gnarls Barkley's \\"Crazy\\" and My Chemical Romance's \\"Welcome to the Black Parade,\\" both released in 2006.[29] The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are the most represented on the 655ÿsong list, with eight songs each.\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert series over two days on October 29 and 30, 2009 at Madison Square Garden in New York. The celebration included performances by Jerry Lee Lewis, U2, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, Simon & Garfunkel, Dion DiMucci, Metallica, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Fergie, Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, Ray Davies, Ozzy Osbourne, Paul Simon, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Little Anthony & the Imperials, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. The first night ran almost six hours with Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band closing the concert with special guests John Fogerty, Darlene Love, Tom Morello, Sam Moore, Jackson Browne, Peter Wolf, and Billy Joel.[30][31][32]\\r\\nArtists are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at an annual induction ceremony. Over the years, the majority of the ceremonies have been held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. However, on January 12, 1993, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles, and was held there again in 2013. On May 6, 1997, about a year and a half after the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the ceremony was held in Cleveland. It returned to Cleveland in 2009 and again in 2012. Current plans call for the ceremony to be in Cleveland every three years. Generally, the number of inductees ranges from about a half-dozen to a dozen. Virtually all living inductees have attended the ceremonies, and they are presented with their Hall of Fame award by an artist who was influenced by that inductee's music. Both the presenter and the inductee speak at the ceremonies, which also include numerous musical performances, by both the inductees and the presenters. The first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included Elvis Presley, James Brown, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Robert Johnson, Jimmie Rodgers, and Jimmy Yancey were inducted as Early Influences, John Hammond received the Lifetime Achievement Award and Alan Freed and Sam Phillips were inducted as Non-Performers.\\r\\nA nominating committee composed of rock and roll historians selects names for the \\"Performers\\" category (singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds), which are then voted on by roughly five hundred experts across the world. Those selected to vote include academics, journalists, producers, and others with music industry experience. Artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists' contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. To be selected for induction, performers must receive the highest number of votes, and also greater than 50% of the votes. Around five to seven performers are inducted each year.[33]\\r\\nIn 2012, six additional groups, the Miracles, the Famous Flames, the Comets, the Blue Caps, the Midnighters, and the Crickets, were inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted. \\"There was a lot of discussion about this,\\" said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. \\"There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question ÿ it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result.\\"[34]\\r\\nEarly Influences includes artists from earlier eras, primarily country, folk, and blues, whose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists. Other notable artists that have been inducted as Early Influences include Bill Kenny & The Ink Spots, country musicians Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, blues musicians Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, and jazz musicians Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong. After Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday in 2000, no one was inducted in this category until 2009, when rockabilly singer Wanda Jackson was selected. Unlike earlier inductees in this category, Jackson's career almost entirely took place after the traditional 1955 start of the \\"rock era\\".\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Non-Performers\\" award, this category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry, including record label executives, songwriters, record producers, disc jockeys, concert promoters and music journalists. This category has had at least one inductee every year except 2007 and 2009. Following the death of the Hall of Fame's co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, this award was renamed in his honor in 2008.[35]\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Sidemen\\" award, this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran session and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers. The category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and re-activated in 2008. This honor was renamed the \\"Award for Musical Excellence\\" in 2010. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, \\"This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized.\\"[36]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives is the world's most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll. The Library and Archives is located in a new building on the Metro Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland's Campus District.\\r\\nThe Library and Archives' mission is to collect, preserve and provide access to these materials. The Library and Archives operates on two levels: people may come into the library and read the books and magazines, listen to music and other recordings, and watch videos and films. More serious scholars, historians and journalists may also make an appointment for access to the archival collections under the supervision of the staff archivists.\\r\\nThe library is composed of books, academic dissertations, and other references. It also includes popular magazines, scholarly journals and trade publications; commercial audio and video recordings, and research databases.\\r\\nThe archival collections include music-business records from record executives, artist managers, labels, historic venues, recording studios, specialists in stage design and lighting, and long-running concert tours. The collections also contain important individual items, such as personal letters penned by Aretha Franklin and Madonna, handwritten working lyrics by Jimi Hendrix and LL Cool J, papers from music journalists such as Sue Cassidy Clark, and rare concert recordings from CBGB in the 1970s.[37][38][39]\\r\\nThe most frequent criticism of the Hall of Fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a few individuals who are not themselves musicians, such as founder Jann Wenner (co-founder and editor-in-chief of Rolling Stone magazine), former foundation director Suzan Evans, and writer Dave Marsh, reflecting their personal tastes rather than the views of the rock world as a whole. A former member of the nominations board once commented that \\"At one point Suzan Evans lamented the choices being made because there weren't enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner. That was quickly remedied by dropping one of the doo-wop groups being considered in favor of a 'name' artist ... I saw how certain pioneering artists of the '50s and early '60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list, resulting in '70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them. Some of those pioneers still aren't in today.\\"[40] Sister Rosetta Tharpe is often considered \\"The Godmother/Grandmother of Rock & Roll\\",[41][42] but has yet to be inducted. Also, the influential soul/funk group Tower of Power has not yet been honored. Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker has dismissed the Hall of Fame as the \\"Hall of Lame\\".[43]\\r\\nThere is also controversy in the lack of transparency in the selection process. Janet Morrissey of The New York Times wrote:\\r\\n\\"With fame and money at stake, it's no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on.

In fifteen years, 97 different artists were inducted.[48] A minimum of 50% of the vote is needed to be inducted; although, the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees (five in 2011) is set before the ballots are shipped.[48] The committee usually nominates a small number of artists (12 in 2010) from an increasing number of different genres. Several voters, including Joel Selvin, himself a former member of the nominating committee, did not submit their ballots in 2007 because they did not feel that any of the candidates were truly worthy.[49]\\r\\nMembers of the British punk rock band The Sex Pistols, inducted in 2006, refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum \\"a piss stain\\" and \\"urine in wine\\".[50]\\r\\nIn BBC Radio 6 Music's Annual John Peel Lecture in 2013, the singer Charlotte Church accused the museum of gender bias, stating, \\"Out of 295 acts and artists in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, 259 are entirely male, meaning that Tina Weymouth's part in Talking Heads makes them one of the 36 female acts.\\"[51][52] In fact, the actual percentage of woman inductees is 8.5%.[53] Combining all the categories, there have been 719 inductees, out of which only 61 have been women, none of which has been inducted more than once or awarded the Lifetime Achievement.[54]\\r\\nOn March 14, 2007, two days after that year's induction ceremony, Roger Friedman of Fox News published an article claiming that the Dave Clark Five should have been the fifth inductee, as they had more votes than inductee Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. The article went on to say \\"Jann Wenner used a technicality about the day votes were due in. In reality, The Dave Clark Five got six more votes than Grandmaster Flash. But he felt we couldn't go another year without a rap act.\\"[47]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation would later deny fixing the vote, although they did not deny that late votes were received, saying, \\"No. There is a format and rules and procedure. There is a specific time when the votes have to be in, and then they are counted. The bands with the top five votes got in.\\"[55] The Dave Clark Five was subsequently nominated again and then inducted the following year.[56]\\r\\nIn June 2007, Monkee Peter Tork complained to the New York Post that Wenner had blackballed the Monkees, commenting:\\r\\n[Wenner] doesn't care what the rules are and just operates how he sees fit. It is an abuse of power. I don't know whether the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame, but it's pretty clear that we're not in there because of a personal whim. Jann seems to have taken it harder than everyone else, and now, 40 years later, everybody says, 'What's the big deal? Everybody else does it.' [Uses studio artists or backing bands.] Nobody cares now except him. He feels his moral judgment in 1967 and 1968 is supposed to serve in 2007.\\r\\nIn a Facebook post, fellow Monkee Michael Nesmith stated that he does not know if the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame because he can only see the impact of the Monkees from the inside, and further stated: \\"I can see the HOF (Hall of Fame) is a private enterprise. It seems to operate as a business, and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise. The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner's pleasure. This seems proper to me. It is their business in any case. It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate, nor should it be compelled to conform to one.\\"[57]\\r\\nVarious magazines and news outlets, such as Time,[58] NPR radio,[59] The Christian Science Monitor,[60] Goldmine magazine,[61][62] Yahoo Music[63] and MSNBC [64] have argued that the Monkees belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","input":"When did the rock n roll hall of fame open?"},{"output":"over 1,200","context":"The Celtic pantheon is known from a variety of sources such as written Celtic mythology, ancient places of worship, statues, engravings, religious objects, and place or personal names.

Their first season was the 1920ÿ21 season. Named the \\"Wildcats\\", Villanova is also a member of the Philadelphia Big Five, a rivalry of Philadelphia college basketball teams.\\r\\nThe Wildcats have won the National Championship three times: 1985, 2016, and 2018. Their 1985 NCAA championship as an 8 seed still stands as the lowest seed ever to win the title. The game is referred to as \\"The Perfect Game\\" as they shot a record 78.6% as a team for the game.[2] Their 2016 NCAA Championship, is referred to as \\"The Perfect Ending\\" and is the only NCAA Men's Championship game to be won on a buzzer beater, as Kris Jenkins drained a shot as time expired.[3] They made the Final Four in 1939, 1971, 1985, 2009, 2016 and 2018; their six Final Four appearances are 13th most all-time. As of 2018, they have an NCAA Tournament record of 64ÿ36 (.640). Villanova has defeated six No. 1 seeds in the NCAA tournament (Michigan and Georgetown in 1985, Pittsburgh in 2009, and Kansas and North Carolina in 2016, and Kansas in 2018), which is sixth most all-time. The Villanova Wildcats have appeared in the NCAA Tournament 37 times, the eighth highest total in NCAA history. They have won the Big East regular season championship eight times, most recently winning four straight from 2014 to 2017. They won the Big East Tournament in 1995, 2015, 2017, and 2018. Villanova entered the 2016ÿ2017 season with an all-time winning percentage of (.648), placing the Wildcats tied for 13th among all NCAA Division I basketball programs. Through 2018, Villanova has 1,753 wins, which is 23rd among Division I men's basketball teams. Villanova has won the Philadelphia Big Five 26 times which is the second most of any team, including five straight from 2014 to 2018. The Wildcats have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament 17 times, winning in 1994.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVillanova began its varsity basketball program in 1920. Michael Saxe coached for six seasons, from 1920 to 1926, compiling a 64ÿ30 record (.681). John Cashman coached three seasons, from 1926 to 1929, compiling a 21ÿ26 record (.447). George \\"Doc\\" Jacobs coached seven seasons, from 1929 to 1936, and had a 62ÿ56 record (.525).\\r\\nThe team played its first game in 1920 in Alumni Hall on Villanova's campus, beating Catholic University 43ÿ40. In the early years, Villanova's home courts were Alumni Hall and West Catholic High School. In 1932, The Wildcats moved into the Villanova Field Housenow known as the Jake Nevin Field House, which was named after Villanova's long-time trainer. Villanova also played many home games at the Palestra on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania beginning in 1929. The Wildcats played home games in both the Villanova Field House and the Palestra until 1986.\\r\\nAl Severance coached Villanova for 25 seasons, from 1936 to 1961.

Severance compiled a 413ÿ201 record (.673).\\r\\nThe 1938ÿ39 team won the first-ever NCAA Tournament game, which put them in the inaugural Final Four. Severance led the Wildcats to the NCAA Tournament again in 1949, 1951, and 1955. Villanova earned NIT bids in 1959 and 1960.\\r\\nThe most storied player in Villanova history, Paul Arizin, played during this era. Severance discovered Arizin, already a Villanova student, playing basketball in the Villanova Fieldhouse. Arizin holds the Villanova record for most points in a game (85), and is credited with inventing the jump shot and was the 1949 College Player of the Year. Other notable players from the Severance era include Joe Lord, Larry Hennessy, Bob Schafer and George Raveling.\\r\\nCoincidentally, Severance died on April 1, 1985, which was the same day that Villanova upset Georgetown University and Patrick Ewing to take the NCAA basketball championship.\\r\\nThe inaugural NCAA Tournament featured eight teams from throughout the country. Villanova, representing the Middle Atlantic States, beat Brown, representative of the New England States, 43ÿ40 before a crowd of 3,500 at the Palestra. The following night, the Wildcats lost to Ohio State 53ÿ36 in the Eastern Division Championship.\\r\\nJack Kraft coached Villanova for 12 years, from 1961 through 1973. He compiled a 238ÿ95 record (.715). Kraft led Villanova to the NCAA Tournament six times, and five times to the NIT. Only once did Kraft's teams fail to earn a post-season bid, in his final season. The 1971 team, led by Howard Porter, reached the NCAA Championship game, and lost to UCLA at the height of the UCLA dynasty.\\r\\nNotable players during the Jack Kraft era include: Chris Ford, Tom Ingelsby, Wali Jones, Bill Melchionni, Howard Porter, Jim Washington, and Hubie White.\\r\\nOn March 27, 1971, Villanova made its first appearance in an NCAA basketball tournament championship game. The unheralded Wildcats took on the legendary John Wooden and his mighty UCLA Bruins. The 28ÿ1 UCLA squad featured Sidney Wicks, Curtis Rowe, Henry Bibby, and Steve Patterson. Going into the title game, the Bruins had won six of the previous seven NCAA championships, including the previous four.\\r\\nJack Kraft's Villanova squad, nicknamed the \\"Iron Men\\", was made up of just nine players. Led by Howard Porter, Clarence Smith, Hank Siemiontkowski, Chris Ford, Tom Ingelsby, Bob Gohl, Mike Daley, John Fox and Joe McDowell. Villanova amassed a 27ÿ6 record, including a shocking 90ÿ47 victory over a previously undefeated powerhouse Penn squad.\\r\\nVillanova fought from behind for most of the game, twice cutting the lead to three in the final minutes. Villanova lost by six, 68ÿ62. Up to that time, the six-point loss was the narrowest spread of UCLA's six NCAA title game victories.\\r\\nDespite the loss, Villanova's Howard Porter was named the Tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Porter was later stripped of the award and the team's NCAA victories were vacated after it was discovered that Porter had violated NCAA rules because he had signed a professional contract with the Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association during the middle of his senior year.\\r\\nDuring Rollie Massimino's tenure, the Villanova Wildcats abandoned their traditional independent status by joining the newly formed Eastern Eight Conference in 1975. In 1980, the 'Cats moved into the new Big East Conference, along with Georgetown, St. John's, and Syracuse. The 1980s were the golden age of the Big East, highlighted by the 1985 NCAA Tournament, when Villanova, Georgetown, and St. John's reached the Final Four.\\r\\nMassimino's teams had tremendous success in the NCAA Tournament, usually in an underdog role. Coach Massimino led the Wildcats to the NCAA Tournament eleven times, winning in 1985. His teams reached the Elite Eight five times in an eleven-year span: 1978, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1988. Coach Massimino's teams were well-prepared for the Tournament, always playing a difficult schedule, and playing tenacious defense. Massimino lost their opening game in the NCAA Tournament only once, to Shaquille O'Neal and Chris Jackson-led LSU in 1990 and he remarkably never lost to a lower seeded team.\\r\\nMassimino coached for 19 seasons at Villanova, compiling a record of 357ÿ241 (.596). In the NCAA Tournament, Massimino had a 20ÿ10 record (.667).\\r\\nNotable players from the Massimino era include Alex Bradley, Stewart Granger, Keith Herron, Dwayne McClain, Harold Jensen, Ed Pinckney, John Pinone, Harold Pressley, Rory Sparrow, and Doug West.\\r\\nIn 1976, the Wildcats played their first game in the Spectrum in Philadelphia. Because of the greater seating capacity, the 'Cats generally played a few home games each year at the Spectrum until the opening of what is now known as the Wells Fargo Center. Villanova christened its current home court as John Eleuthre du Pont Pavilion, now the Pavilion, with a 64ÿ62 victory over Len Bias led Maryland squad on February 1, 1986.\\r\\nIn 1985, under the direction of coach Rollie Massimino, the men's basketball team completed one of the most surprising runs in NCAA tournament history by winning the national championship in the first year of the 64-team field. The eighth-seeded Wildcats (unranked in the final AP poll) beat Dayton (at Dayton), top-seeded Michigan, Maryland and second-seeded North Carolina to win the Southeast Regional en route to the Final Four in Lexington, Kentucky. After defeating 2-seed Memphis State in the national semifinals, Villanova met defending champion and ten-point-favorite Georgetown, led by Patrick Ewing, in the title game on April Fools' Day.\\r\\nTop-seeded Georgetown had beaten conference rival Villanova twice during the regular season, and had reached the title game with tenacious defense, which gave up less than 40% of their opponents' shots from the field in both the regular season and the postseason. Before the championship game, Massimino told his team they had to play a perfect game in order to beat Georgetown. In perhaps the greatest shooting performance in NCAA history, the Wildcats went 22-of-28 from the field to convert a blistering 78.6% of their shots, including a second half where they missed only one basket. The Hoyas hung tough, converting 55% of their 53 attempts, but were unable to overcome the astounding shooting performance as Villanova won 66ÿ64 to claim the NCAA championship. The Wildcat squad remains the only eight-seed and the lowest overall seed in tournament history to win the championship, and their overall team shooting percentage remains an NCAA tournament record for a single game. The game is often cited among the greatest upsets in college basketball history. Ed Pinckney, who shot 5-of-7 and had 16 points in the game, was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. This game is featured in the book The Perfect Game by Frank Fitzpatrick.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nLappas compiled a very respectable record of 174ÿ110 (.613) during his years at Villanova. The 1994 and 1995 teams, led by Kerry Kittles, Jason Lawson, Eric Eberz, and Alvin Williams, won the NIT and Big East Tournaments, respectively. However, five nights after their victory in the 1995 Big East Championship, the Wildcats lost a triple-overtime thriller to underdog Old Dominion on St. Patrick's Night in Albany, New York in a 1st round NCAA game many Villanova fans consider the most painful loss in Villanova history.\\r\\nUnder Coach Lappas, Villanova reached the NCAA Tournament in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1999, compiling a disappointing 2ÿ4 record.\\r\\nNotable players in the Lappas era include Michael Bradley, Kerry Kittles, Jason Lawson, Tim Thomas, John Celestand and Alvin Williams and Eric Eberz.\\r\\nVillanova began playing a few major home games at the Wells Fargo Center beginning in 1996. Villanova's first game in the new arena was a December 1996 loss to the Duke Blue Devils. Wells Fargo Center was known as the CoreStates Center, the First Union Center, and the Wachovia Center before it adopted the Wells Fargo Center name.\\r\\nJay Wright was named Villanova's head coach in 2001. As Rollie Massiminos assistant from 1987 through 1992, he was well-acquainted with Villanova. Prior to his hiring by Villanova, Wright was head coach at Hofstra.\\r\\nVillanova earned a post-season tournament berth in each of Wright's initial ten seasons as Villanova head coach before missing in 2011ÿ12. The Wildcats played in the NIT in 2002, 2003, and 2004, and in 11 NCAA Tournaments in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. During Wright's tenure, Villanova has compiled a 20ÿ10 record in the NCAA Tournament crowned with the 2016 National Championship. Six of Wright's ten NCAA Tournament losses at Villanova were to the eventual National Champion. One of the highlights of his tenure was an amazing run to the 2009 Final Four when Villanova beat #1 seeded Pittsburgh in the Elite 8 on a coast to coast buzzer beater shot by team captain Scottie Reynolds. Villanova subsequently lost the national semifinals to eventual NCAA Champion North Carolina.\\r\\nThe struggling finishes to both the 2009ÿ10 and 2010ÿ11 seasons were highlighted by losing streaks down the stretch followed by some poorly played NCAA games where Villanova barely beat Robert Morris in overtime and took losses at the hands of St Mary's (2010) and George Mason (2011) in the NCAA Tournament. Villanova had a rebuilding season with a disappointing 13ÿ19 record in 2011ÿ12 season and they missed an NCAA bid after 7 consecutive appearances in the Tournament. It was the first season that Jay Wright did not lead the program into any postseason tournament. The 2012ÿ13 season saw a return trip to NCAA tournament but a #2 seed in 2013ÿ14 and a #1 seed in 2014ÿ15 both ended quickly in the Round of 32 showing a negative 6 year trend where Jay Wright went 3ÿ5 in NCAA Tournament games despite favorable seeds. This drew comparisons to Steve Lappas tournament futility in the prior regime. The 2016 Championship ended that long drought.\\r\\nNotable players during the Jay Wright era include Randy Foye, Kyle Lowry, Dante Cunningham, Allan Ray, Will Sheridan, Curtis Sumpter, Scottie Reynolds, Corey Fisher, Maalik Wayns, Mouphtaou Yarou, JayVaughn Pinkston, Darrun Hilliard, Ryan Arcidiacono, Daniel Ochefu, Kris Jenkins and Josh Hart.\\r\\nUnder coach Jay Wright, Villanova's men's basketball team reached the 2005 NCAA Tournament Sweet 16, defeating New Mexico and Florida before losing to #1 seed and eventual champion North Carolina by one point. Junior Forward Curtis Sumpter was injured in the Florida game and did not return to the court until the 2006ÿ07 season. There is controversy surrounding a disputed traveling call against Allan Ray made in the closing seconds of the UNC game. With under a minute left and Villanova down by three, Ray drove and made a shot. There was contact with a UNC defender and a whistle. Most assumed the whistle signified a foul on Carolina, giving Ray a chance to tie the game with the resultant free-throw. Incredibly, the officials ruled that Ray committed a traveling violation prior to taking the shot, negating the basket, and rendering Kyle Lowry's buzzer beating 3 pointer a mere footnote to a painful loss.\\r\\nLed by senior guards Randy Foye and Allan Ray as well as sophomore guard Kyle Lowry, the Villanova men's basketball team began the 2005ÿ2006 year ranked #4 in the major polls from USA Today and the Associated Press. Having lost only three regular season games, the Wildcats enjoyed a #1 seed in the 2006 tournamenttheir first. The Wildcats' wins over Monmouth, Arizona, and Boston College brought them back to the Elite Eight for the first time since 1988. Villanova's 75ÿ62 upset loss in Minneapolis to eventual champion Florida ended the team's run toward a Regional Final. The loss to Florida was the second consecutive year that Villanova was eliminated in the NCAA Tournament by the eventual national champion. The Wildcats' 28 wins during the 2006 campaign was the second most victories for any Villanova Men's Basketball team at that time. Foye, Ray and Lowry all entered the NBA following the season.\\r\\nWright's 2006ÿ2007 team was composed mainly of freshmen and sophomores who, at times, struggled to mesh. The Wildcats improved throughout the season, due in large part to the emergence of freshman Scottie Reynolds. Villanova finished the 2006ÿ07 season with a record of 22ÿ11. The Wildcats earned an at-large bid to the 2007 NCAA Tournament, where they lost in the second round to the Kentucky Wildcats. Villanova's 2006ÿ07 free throw percentage of .781 led the NCAA, and set a Villanova season record.[5]\\r\\nThe 2007ÿ08 campaign was an erratic one for the young Wildcats, a team with no seniors. After a promising 9ÿ1 start, Villanova had a rough start to its Big East season. In mid-season, the Wildcats lost five consecutive games by double digits and lost 6 of 7 games during a 3-week span in the middle of the season, as the freshmen struggled to adjust to the college game, and the experienced players encountered difficulties in adjusting to leadership positions. In February and March, as the players became more comfortable within Coach Wright's system, and with improved defense, the team began to win.\\r\\nA win against Syracuse in the Big East Tournament was good enough for the Wildcats to secure one of the final at-large bids to the NCAA Tournament. Villanova proved it was worthy of the bid when an upset over Clemson and a victory over Siena put them in the final 16 teams in the tournament, where they lost to eventual National Champion Kansas.\\r\\nMost notable in the 2008ÿ09 season was the rise to prominence of senior forward Dante Cunningham. Cunningham averaged 16.1 points per game, an increase of nearly 6 points over the previous season. He also managed to average 7.5 rebounds, 1.2 blocks, and 1.2 steals per game.[6] Cunningham was honored as the Big East Most Improved Player.[7] His teammate, tenacious sophomore guard Corey Fisher, was also honored as the Big East Sixth Man of the Year for his contributions off the bench.[7]\\r\\nThe Wildcats finished the regular season with a mark of 26ÿ7, earning a school record for most regular season victories. They lost their final regular season game to the Louisville Cardinals, 69ÿ55, in the fourth round, or semi-finals of the Big East Tournament.[8] The Wildcats began the NCAA Tournament at the Wachovia Center, a secondary venue for home games. They survived an early scare by American[8] to handily beat two of college basketball's most prestigious programs, UCLA and Duke, in the rounds of 32 and 16 by a combined margin of 43 points.[9][10]\\r\\nVillanova won a very close match up against number 1 seed Pittsburgh in the Elite 8 round of the tournament, with guard Scottie Reynolds racing down the court to make a layup with only 0.5 seconds left. Pitt took the final shot, which bounced off the backboard to end the game. The last-second basket by Reynolds was widely hailed as one of the most exciting plays of that year's tournament, with Sports Illustrated's Seth Davis calling the victory \\"one of the great games in NCAA tournament history\\".[11] Villanova advanced to the Final Four where they faced the North Carolina Tar Heels. Villanova fell to the Tar Heels in the National Semifinals at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan, by a final score of 83ÿ69.[12] This was the fourth time in five years that Villanova's tournament ouster was by the eventual national champion.\\r\\nThe Wildcats' record of 30ÿ8 broke a previous high for most victories in a season, a distinction previously held by the 2005ÿ06 Wildcats squad. The senior class of 2009, composed of forwards Dante Cunningham, Shane Clark, Dwayne Anderson and Frank Tchuisi, earned the distinction of being the winningest senior class in school history.[13]\\r\\nThe Wildcats enjoyed another highly successful regular season, finishing with a record of 24ÿ7 and earning a #2 Seed in the NCAA Tournament. They lost in the first round of the Big East Tournament to Marquette and required overtime to defeat 15th seeded Robert Morris University in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament. The Wildcats were defeated in the 2nd round by the 10th seeded St. Mary's Gaels.\\r\\nScottie Reynolds ended his career as the second-leading scorer in Villanova history with 2,222 points, 21 points short of breaking Kerry Kittles's all-time record. He finished his College career with 472 assists and 203 steals. Reynolds was named to the 2010 AP All-American 1st team, but was not selected in the NBA draft.\\r\\nThe Wildcats enjoyed another highly successful regular season and held the AP #1 ranking in the nation for the first time in school history over a 3-week period. They finished the regular season with a 27ÿ4 record losing only to teams (Oklahoma, Virginia, Providence, Xavier) that were ranked at the time of the match-up. Villanova finished Big East Conference play 16ÿ2 for the third year in a row also garnering their 3rd straight outright Regular Season Conference Title. After losing in the Big East Tournament Championship Game to Seton Hall, 69ÿ67, the Wildcats earned a 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament South Region where they dispatched the #15 seeded UNC Asheville by 30 points, followed by a 19-point win over #7 seed Iowa. After defeating #3 seed Miami by 23, they moved on to the Elite Eight to face the overall #1 seed Kansas Jayhawks. The Wildcats defense shined as they won by 5 points to advance to their 5th Final Four and the first since 2009. They faced #2 seed Oklahoma Sooners, who had beaten Villanova by 23 on December 7, 2015, at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii early in the season. In the National Semi-Finals, Villanova beat the Sooners by 44 points (an NCAA Final Four record) to advance to the NCAA Championship for the first time in 31 years. They faced the second-overall #1 seed North Carolina Tar Heels for the championship. On April 4, Villanova defeated UNC on a game-winning three-point shot at the buzzer by Kris Jenkins to win the NCAA Championship by a final score of 77ÿ74, winning their second NCAA championship. UNC had recovered from a 10-point deficit in the final five minutes to tie the game on an off-balance, double-clutch three-point shot that passed through the net with 4.7 seconds left, leaving the Wildcats one last chance to clinch a victory before overtime. Kris Jenkins inbounded the ball to four-year team captain Ryan Arcidiacono, who dribbled down court, passed the ball and set a bubble screen to assist Jenkins' game-winning shot. Coach Jay Wright credits the play to the \\"Wildcat minute\\", where the team practices late-game scenarios at every practice. The game has been called one of the greatest in the history of NCAA Tournament Championships.[14][15]\\r\\nVillanova ended the 2016 season at 35ÿ5 including the unanimous #1 ranking in the final Coaches' Poll (USA Today) while capturing their 2nd NCAA basketball championship trophy in the history of the program. In beating #3 seed Miami (AP #10), #1 seed Kansas (AP #1), #2 seed Oklahoma (AP #7) and #1 seed UNC (AP #3), Villanova became the first school in 31 years  since the 1985 Villanova Wildcats  to not only beat four top-three seeds on the way to a national title but to also beat four straight opponents ranked in the AP top 10, in addition to beating AP-ranked Iowa in the Round of 32. Villanova's run included two of the ten most offensively efficient games in the analytics era (2002ÿpresent), beating Miami and Oklahoma by scoring 1.56 and 1.51 points per possession in the Sweet Sixteen and Final Four, respectively.[16] It has been called perhaps the most dominant tournament championship run of all time, and the most dominant of the analytics era by a wide margin, with Villanova posting an average margin of victory equal to 20.7 points per game (+124 total point margin).[15]\\r\\nThe Wildcats finished second in regular season Big East play, won the Big East tournament, and were undefeated in non-conference play. They were awarded the top seed in the East Regional for the NCAA tournament. They reached the Final Four with wins over 16 seed Radford, 9 seed Alabama, 5 seed West Virginia and 3 seed Texas Tech, each victory coming by double digit margins. In the National Semifinals they faced the Kansas Jayhawks, the one seed from the Midwest Region, and defeated them 95ÿ79. In this game Villanova set the new record for successful 3-point attempts in a Final Four game (breaking the previous full-game record before reaching halftime, finishing with 18 total made attempts). In the NCAA Tournament Championship Game they played the Michigan Wolverines, the 3 seed from the West Region. The Wildcats earned their third national championship in school history by beating the Wolverines 79ÿ62. The game saw an historic performance by Big East Sixth Man of the Year Donte DiVincenzo (31 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, 2 steals and 2 blocks), named the 2018 Final Four's Most Outstanding Player[17]. Coach Wright led the team to a 36ÿ4 record for the 2017ÿ18 season (14ÿ4 Big East). The 36ÿ4 mark sets the record for most wins in any Villanova season. Jalen Brunson received the Wooden Award as well as Associated Press and Naismith National Player of the Year Awards for his season leading the Wildcats.[18] Mikal Bridges was presented the Julius Erving Award as the nations best small forwardthe second straight year a Villanova player achieved that honor after Josh Hart won it in 2017. Jay Wright was named winner of the John R. Wooden Legends of Coaching Award.[19]\\r\\nBig East Most Improved Player of the Year\\r\\nVillanova has appeared in 38 NCAA Tournaments, beginning with the first in 1939. The Wildcats have amassed a tournament record of 64ÿ36 (.640), and were the national champions in 1985, 2016, and 2018. Villanova has won as the underdog (based on Tournament seeding) 16 times, more than any other program.[21] Villanova is one of only two programs (the other being Ohio State) that has played in the NCAA Tournament in every decade since the 1930s.\\r\\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\\r\\nThe Wildcats have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 17 times.

For those honored, a replica jersey is hung in the rafters of the Pavilion. Uniform numbers of retired jerseys remain in circulation, while retired numbers are no longer used. Paul Arizin's #11 is the only retired number. As of 2011[update], 19 have been honored with a retired number or jersey, including 14 players, four coaches, and longtime trainer Jake Nevin.[22]\\r\\nThe honorees include:\\r\\nSome Villanovans count Georgetown as their most intense rivalry, having played a historic NCAA Championship game and many competitive Big East Tournament and regular season games against the Hoyas. Other rivals from the Big East Conference include founding members of the original Big EastProvidence (an eastern rivalry which predates the original Big East) and St. John's, plus Syracuse who left the Big East as part of its 2013 split ACC.\\r\\nSeton Hall has played Villanova more than any other school;[25] due to the proximity of the schools and a series of memorable games since the formation of the new Big East, this has become one of Villanova's top rivalries each season. Games have included critical Seton Hall upsets in 2013, the 2014 Big East Tournament, Villanova's first loss of 2015, and the 2016 Big East Tournament championship as well as a Villanova blowout in a game that resulted in Seton Hall guard Sterling Gibbs punching Villanova guard Ryan Arcidiacono in 2015 and a narrow victory in the closing seconds of the 2017 Big East Tournament semifinals.\\r\\nVillanova along with Saint Joseph's University, La Salle University, Temple University, and University of Pennsylvania banded together to create the Philadelphia Big 5 in 1954ÿ55. From that date until the mid-1970s all Big 5 games were contested at the Palestra (cap. 9,208) on Penn's campus. The Five competed in a round-robin City Series. Additionally, all participated in numerous doubleheaders against non-Big 5 opponents. Most games were televised locally on WPHL-TV, broadcast by Harry Kalas.\\r\\nSince the beginning of the 1996ÿ1997 season, Villanova has won 15 out of 21 Big 5 titles. They currently have 25 total Big 5 titles which is second most among the participating schools.\\r\\nVillanova's bitterest Big 5 rival is Saint Joseph's University, in what has become known as the Holy War.\\r\\nVillanova basketball athletes traditionally remain enrolled four years, graduate, and go on to enjoy post-college success. Villanova has never had to fire a head basketball coach (men's or women's) for any reason. Villanova has won more NCAA tournament games as a lower seed than any school. Villanova won what has been called the greatest college basketball game ever played, defeating Georgetown 66ÿ64 on April 1, 1985 to win the NCAA National Championship.\\r\\nV for Villanova is the Wildcats' fight song. Other Villanova songs include March of the Wildcats.\\r\\nVillanova had a tradition of throwing paper streamers in the school colors of blue and white onto the basketball court at home games, particularly Big Five games, after the first Wildcat basket. This tradition was shared by other Big Five basketball teams, and at Big Five games, streamers were thrown by both teams following their team's first field goal. The tradition was stopped in the late 1980s after the NCAA declared that throwing streamers would result in a technical foul. Since then Villanova has restarted the tradition, throwing the streamers on the first basket of the new season during the blue and white scrimmage game during Hoops Mania.\\r\\nHoops Mania has been an annual tradition to celebrate the start of basketball season. It was originally held in the Jake Nevin Fieldhouse for students and has since grown larger after the success of the 2005ÿ06 season. It is now held in the Pavilion and is open to the public and students. Following an inter-team scrimmage, notable music artists perform.","input":"How many times has villanova won the national basketball championship?"},{"output":"about 2.88 million years ago","context":"","input":"When did the first tiger appeared on earth?"},{"output":"a World Health Organization-sponsored collaborative","context":"The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is a ten-question test developed by a World Health Organization-sponsored collaborative project to determine if a person may be at risk for alcohol abuse problems.[1][2] The test was designed to be used internationally, and was validated in a study drawing patients from six countries. Several research studies have found that the AUDIT screening tool is a reliable and valid measure in identifying alcohol abuse problem behaviors and it has been found to be a valid indicator for severity of alcohol dependence.[3][4] There is some evidence that the AUDIT works in adolescents and young adults; it appears less accurate in older adults.

The religion arrived in Australia with the First Fleet in 1788, and since the 1960s, has remained stable at around one quarter of the Australian population. In 2016, there were 5,439,268 Australian Catholics, representing 23% of the overall population, and the Church was the single largest non-government provider of education, health, community and aged care services.[1][2][3] Australia has 32 dioceses and 1,363 parishes. It has more than 180 congregations of sisters, brothers and religious priests, working in diverse vocations ranging from education, to health care, poverty alleviation, social justice, and cloistered contemplation.  The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, the national episcopal conference of the Catholic bishops of Australia,[4] is headed by the Archbishop of Brisbane, Mark Coleridge, and there are two living Australian cardinals: the current Prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, George Pell, and the retired Edward Cassidy.  One Australian has been recognised as a saint by the Catholic Church: Mary MacKillop, who co-founded  the Josephite religious institute of sisters in the 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nCatholicism arrived in Australia with the establishment of a British colony at New South Wales and the first Australian Catholics were mainly of Irish origin. British authorities initially suppressed the religion, but priests were permitted to stay from the 1820s and the colony gained its first Catholic Church in 1836. The first nuns arrived in 1838 founding a strong tradition of women religious working in health, education and prison chaplaincy. Australia gained diocesan status in 1846, and the Church flourished through the 19th century with the establishment of dioceses, parishes hospitals and schools across the continent. The diversity of Australian Catholics increased greatly with 20th century post war immigration, with large numbers coming from Italy, the Mediterranean, Asia and later Africa. Catholics have been prominent in Australian political and cultural life, and religious in public life today straddle the political divides - from advocating on \\"social conservative\\" causes such as opposition to abortion, euthanasia and marriage redefinition, to working in \\"social justice\\" causes such as advocacy for refugees, indigenous people, and workers.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 20th and early 21st century, Catholicism in Australia has been growing numerically, while remaining relatively stable as a proportion of the population and facing a long-term decline in numbers of people taking vocations to the religious life. In 2016, the Catholic education sector ran 1,738 schools, accounting for some 20.2% of Australian school students.[6][3] There were also two Catholic universities - University of Notre Dame Australia and the Australian Catholic University and Australia played host to World Youth Day 2008. Catholic Social Services Australia, the Church's peak national body for social services, had 52 member organisations providing services to hundreds of thousands of people each year.[7] Catholic Health Australia was the largest non-government provider grouping of health, community and aged care services.[8] The Church was among the secular and religious institutions examined at the 2013-2017 Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, which reported that abuse cases by Catholic personnel had peaked in the 1970s, with around 4400 cases and alleged cases over the 6 decades prior to the inquiry. In 2017, there were 5.5 million Australian Catholics.[9][10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2011 Australian National Census enumerated there were 5,439,257 Catholics in Australia. This represented 25.3% of the overall Australian population and the largest single Christian church (being slightly larger than the Anglican and Uniting churches combined).[13]  At the 2016 Census, the enumerated Australian Catholic population had fallen to 5,291,839.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 1986 census, Australia's most populous Christian church was the Anglican Church of Australia. Since then Catholics have outnumbered Anglicans by an increasing margin. One rationale to explain this relates to changes in Australia's immigration patterns.[14] Before the Second World War, the majority of immigrants to Australia came from the United Kingdom and most  Catholic immigrants came from Ireland. After the war, Australia's immigration diversified and more than 6.5 million migrants arrived in the following 60 years, including more than a million Catholics from Italy, Malta, Lebanon, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Croatia and Hungary.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 2016 Census, the ancestries that Australian Catholics most identified with were 'English' (1.49 million), 'Australian' (1.12 million), Irish (577,000), Italian (567,000) and Filipino (181,000).\\r\\n\\r\\nCatholicism is now the largest church tradition in Australia and the Catholic population continues to grow, although weekly Mass attendance has declined from an estimated 74% in the mid-50's to around 14% in 2006.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are seven archdioceses and 32 dioceses, with an estimated 3,000 priests and 9,000 men and women in institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life, including six dioceses which cover the whole country: one each for those who belong to the Chaldean, Maronite, Melkite, Syro-Malabar and Ukrainian rites and one for those serving in the Australian Defence Forces. There is also a personal ordinariate for\\r\\nformer Anglicans which has a similar status to a diocese.[17]\\r\\n[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince time immemorial, indigenous people in Australia had performed the rites and rituals of the animist religions of the Dreamtime. Europeans had assumed the existence of a great southern land mass since ancient times. Among the first Catholics known to have sighted Australia were the crew of a Spanish expedition of 1605ÿ6. In 1606, the expedition's leader, Pedro Fernandez de Quiros  landed in the New Hebrides and after a brief encounter with Mary Casotti, believed it to be the fabled southern continent, he named the land: Austrialis del Espiritu Santo Southern Land of the Holy Spirit.[20][21] Later that year, his deputy Lus Vaz de Torres sailed through Australia's Torres Strait.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe permanent presence of Catholicism in Australia however, came with the arrival of the First Fleet of British convict ships at Sydney in 1788. One-tenth of all the convicts who came to Australia on the First Fleet were Catholic, and at least half of them were born in Ireland.[14] A small proportion of British marines were also Catholic.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as the British were setting up the new colony, French captain Jean-Fran?ois de Galaup, comte de Laprouse arrived off Botany Bay with two ships.[23][24][25] La Prouse was 6 weeks in Port Jackson, where the French, besides other things, held Catholic Masses.[26] The crew conducted the first Catholic burial, that of Father Louis Receveur, a Franciscan monk, who died while the ships were at anchor at Botany Bay.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the Irish convicts had been transported to Australia for political crimes or social rebellion in Ireland, so the authorities were suspicious of Catholicism for the first three decades of settlement.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nCatholic convicts were compelled to attend Church of England services and their children and orphans were raised by the authorities as Anglicans.[29] The first Catholic priests arrived in Australia as convicts in 1800 ÿ James Harold,[30] James Dixon and Peter O'Neill, who had been convicted for \\"complicity\\" in the Irish 1798 Rebellion. Fr Dixon was conditionally emancipated and permitted to celebrate Mass. On 15 May 1803, in vestments made from curtains and with a chalice made of tin, he conducted the first Catholic Mass in New South Wales.[29] The Irish led Castle Hill Rebellion of 1804 alarmed the British authorities and Dixon's permission to celebrate Mass was revoked. Fr Jeremiah O' Flinn,[31] an Irish Cistercian monk, was appointed as Prefect Apostolic of New Holland and set out from Britain for the colony  uninvited. Watched by authorities, Flynn secretly performed priestly duties before being arrested and deported to London. Reaction to the affair in Britain led to two further priests being allowed to travel to the colony in 1820 ÿ John Joseph Therry and Philip Connolly.[28] The foundation stone for the first St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney was laid on 29 October 1821 by Governor Lachlan Macquarie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe absence of a Catholic mission in Australia before 1818 reflected the legal disabilities of Catholics in Britain and the difficult position of Ireland within the British Empire. The government therefore endorsed the English Benedictine monks to lead the early church in the colony.[32] William Bernard Ullathorne (1806ÿ1889) was instrumental in influencing Pope Gregory XVI to establish the hierarchy in Australia. Ullathorne was in Australia from 1833ÿ1836 as vicar-general to Bishop William Morris (1794ÿ1872), whose jurisdiction extended over the Australian missions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Church of England was disestablished in the colony of New South Wales by the Church Act of 1836, which also provided equal funding of Protestant and Catholic Churches.[33] Drafted by the Catholic attorney-general John Plunkett, the Act established legal equality for Anglicans, Catholics and Presbyterians and was later extended to Methodists. Nevertheless, social attitudes were slow to change. A laywoman, Caroline Chisholm (1808ÿ1877), faced discouragements and anti-Catholic feeling when she sought to establish a migrant women's shelter and worked for women's welfare in the colonies in the 1840s, though her humanitarian efforts later won her fame in England and great influence in achieving support for families in the colony.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe church's most prominent early leader was John Bede Polding, a Benedictine monk who was Sydney's first bishop (and then archbishop) from 1835 to 1877. Polding requested a community of nuns be sent to the colony and five Irish Sisters of Charity arrived in 1838. While tensions arose between the English Benedictine hierarchy and the Irish Ignatian-tradition religious institute from the start, the sisters set about pastoral care in a women's prison and began visiting hospitals and schools and establishing employment for convict women. In 1847, two sisters transferred to Hobart and established a school.[35] The sisters went on to establish hospitals in four of the eastern states, beginning with St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney in 1857 as a free hospital for all people, but especially for the poor.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Polding's request, the Christian Brothers arrived in Sydney in 1843 to assist in schools. Again jurisdictional tensions arose and the brothers returned to Ireland.  In 1857, Polding founded an Australian religious institute in the Benedictine tradition ÿ the Sisters of the Good Samaritan ÿ to work in education and social work.[37] While Polding was in office, construction began on the ambitious Gothic Revival designs for St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne and the final St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstablishing themselves first at Sevenhill, in the newly established colony of South Australia in 1848, the Jesuits were the first religious order of priests to enter and establish houses in South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory ÿ Austrian Jesuits established themselves in the south and north and Irish in the east. The goldrush saw an increase in the population and prosperity of the colonies and called for an increase in the number of episcopal sees. When gold was discovered in late 1851, there were an estimated 9,000 Catholics in the Colony of Victoria, increasing to 100,000 by the time the Jesuits arrived 14 years later. While the Austrian priests traversed the Outback on horseback to found missions and schools, the Irish priests arrived in the east in 1860 and had by 1880 established the major schools of Xavier College in Melbourne, St Aloysius' College and Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview in Sydney ÿ which each survive to the present.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1885, Patrick Francis Moran became Australia's first cardinal. St Patrick's College, Manly, intended to provide priests for all the colonies, was opened in 1889. Moran believed that Catholics' political and civil rights were threatened in Australia and, in 1896, saw deliberate discrimination in a situation where \\"no office of first, or even second, rate importance is held by a Catholic\\".[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Catholic Church also became involved in mission work among the Aboriginal people of Australia during the 19th century as Europeans came to control much of the continent. According to Aboriginal anthropologist Kathleen Butler-McIlwraith, there were many occasions when the Catholic Church attempted to advocate for Aboriginal rights, but the missionaries were also \\"functionaries of the Protection and Assimilation policies\\" of the government and so \\"directly contributed to the current disadvantage experienced by Indigenous Australians\\".[40][41] The missionaries themselves argued that they protected children from dysfunctional aspects of indigenous culture.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the withdrawal of state aid for church schools around 1880, the Catholic Church, unlike other Australian churches, put great energy and resources into creating a comprehensive alternative system of education. It was largely staffed by sisters, brothers and priests of religious institutes, such as the Christian Brothers (who had returned to Australia in 1868); the Sisters of Mercy (who had arrived in Perth in 1846); Marist Brothers, who came from France in 1872 and the Sisters of St Joseph, founded in Australia by Mary MacKillop and Fr Julian Tenison Woods in 1867.[43][44][45] MacKillop travelled throughout Australasia and established schools, convents and charitable institutions but came into conflict with those bishops who preferred diocesan control of the institute rather than central control from Adelaide by the Josephite religious institute. MacKillop administered the Josephites as a national religious institute at a time when Australia was divided among individually governed colonies. She is today the most revered of Australian Catholics, beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1995 and canonised by Benedict XVI in 2010.[46] Catholic schools flourished in Australia and by 1900 there were 115 Christian Brothers teaching in Australia. By 1910 there were 5000 religious sisters teaching in schools.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Constitution of 1901 guaranteed Freedom of Religion and the separation of church and state throughout Australia. Australia's first Catholic cardinal, Patrick Francis Moran (1830ÿ1911), had been a proponent of Australian Federation but in 1901 he refused to attend the inauguration ceremony of the Commonwealth of Australia because precedence was given to the Church of England. He was criticised in The Bulletin for speaking against racist immigration laws and he alarmed Catholic conservatives by supporting Trade Unionism and the newly formed Australian Labor Party.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Catholic Church was rooted in the working class Irish communities.  Moran, the Archbishop of Sydney from 1884 to 1911, believed that Catholicism would flourish with the emergence of the new nation through Federation in 1901, provided that his people rejected  \\"contamination\\" from foreign influences such as  anarchism, socialism, modernism and secularism.  Moran distinguished between European socialism as an atheistic movement and those Australians calling themselves \\"socialists\\"; he approved the objectives of the latter while feeling that the European model was not a real danger in Australia. Moran's outlook reflected his wholehearted acceptance of Australian democracy and his belief in the country as different and freer than the old societies from which its people had come.[48] Moran thus welcomed the Labor Party and the Catholic Church stood with it in opposing conscription in the referenda of 1916 and 1917.[49] The hierarchy had close ties to Rome, which encouraged the bishops to support the British Empire and emphasize Marian piety.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother Irish cleric, Archbishop Daniel Mannix (1864ÿ1963) of Melbourne, who was a controversial voice against conscription during World War I and against British Empire policy in Ireland. He was also a fervent critic of contraception. In 1920, the Royal Navy prevented him landing in his Irish homeland.[51] Yet despite early 20th century sectarian feeling, Australia elected its first Catholic prime minister, James Scullin, of the Australian Labor Party in 1929 ÿ decades before the Protestant majority of the United States would elect John F. Kennedy as its first Catholic president.[52] His successor, Joseph Lyons, a devout Irish Catholic, split from Labor to form the fiscally conservative United Australia Party ÿ predecessor to the modern Liberal Party of Australia. His wife, Dame Enid Lyons, a Catholic convert, became the first female member of the Australian House of Representatives and later first female member of cabinet in the Menzies Government.[53] With the place of Catholics in the British Empire still complicated by the recent Irish War of Independence and centuries of imperial rivalry with Catholic European nations, as prime minister, Lyons travelled to London in 1935 for the Silver Jubilee celebrations of King George V and faced anti-Catholic demonstrations in Edinburgh, then visited his ancestral homeland of Ireland and had an audience with the Pope in Rome.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil about 1950, the Catholic Church in Australia was overwhelmingly Irish in its ethos. Most Catholics were descendants of Irish immigrants and the church was mostly led by Irish-born priests and bishops. From 1950 the ethnic composition of the church began to change, with the assimilation of Irish Australians and the arrival of Eastern European Displaced Persons from 1948[55] and more than one million Catholics from countries such as Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Germany, Croatia and Hungary, and later Filipinos, Vietnamese, Lebanese and Poles around the 1980s. There are now also strong Chinese, Korean and Latin American Catholic communities.[14][56]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time, Irish-Australians had a close political association with the Labor Party.[citation needed] The changing ethnic composition of Australian Catholicism and shifting political allegiances of Australian Catholics saw Catholic layman B.A. Santamaria, the son of Italian immigrants, lead a movement of working class Catholics against Communism in Australia and the formation of his Democratic Labor Party (DLP) in 1955. The DLP was formed over concerns of Communist influence over the trade unions and Labor Party. The movement was not approved by the Vatican, but it siphoned a proportion of the Catholic vote away from the Labor Party, contributing to the success of the newly formed Liberal Party of Robert Menzies, which held power from 1949 to 1972, which, in return for DLP preferences, secured state aid for Catholic schools in Australia in 1963.[57] Along with a sharp decline in sectarianism in post 1960s Australia, sectarian loyalty to political parties has diminished and Catholics have been well represented within the conservative Liberal and National parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrendan Nelson became the first Catholic to lead the Liberal Party in 2007. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott was a seminarian who won the party leadership after defeating two other Catholic candidates for the post.[58] In 2008, Tim Fischer, a Catholic and former deputy prime minister in the Howard Government, was nominated by the Labor prime minister, Kevin Rudd, as the first resident Australian ambassador to the Holy See since 1973, when diplomatic relations with the Vatican and Australia was first established.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Second Vatican Council of the 1960s, the Australian church has experienced a decline in vocations to the religious life, leading to a priest shortage. On the other hand, Catholic education under lay leadership has expanded, and about 20% of Australian school students attend a Catholic school.[3] While the numbers of nuns serving in Australian health facilities declined, the church maintained a strong presence in health care. The Sisters of Charity continued their mission among the sick, opening Australia's first HIV AIDS ward at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney in the 1980s.[60] Declining vocations and increasing complexities in the Health care technologies and management saw religious institutes like the Sisters of Charity and Sisters of Mercy amalgamating their efforts and divesting themselves of daily management of hospitals.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Vatican II, new styles of ministry were tried by Australian religious. Some rose to national prominence. Fr Ted Kennedy began one such ministry in Sydney's inner city Redfern presbytery in 1971 ÿ an area with a large Aboriginal population. Working closely with Catholic Aboriginal laywoman \\"Mum\\" Shirl Smith, he developed a theology which held that the poor had special insights into the meaning of Christianity, worked as an advocate for Aboriginal rights and often challenged the civil and church establishment on questions of conscience.[62] In 1989, Jesuit lawyer Fr Frank Brennan AO founded Uniya, a centre for social justice and human rights research, advocacy, education and networking. Uniya focused much of its attention on the plight of refugees, asylum seekers, and Indigenous reconciliation. In 1991, Fr Chris Riley formed Youth Off The Streets, a community organisation working for young people who are 'chronically homeless, drug dependent and recovering from abuse'. Originally a food van in Sydney's King's Cross, it has grown to be one of the largest youth services in Australia, offering crisis accommodation, residential rehabilitation, clinical services and counselling, outreach programs, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, specialist Aboriginal services, education and family support.[63]  Melbourne priest Father Bob Maguire began parish work in the 1960s, but became a youth media personality in 2004 with the beginning of a series of collaborations with irreverent satirist John Safran on SBS TV and Triple J radio.[64][65]\\r\\n\\r\\n1970 saw the first visit to Australia by a Pope, Paul VI.[66] Pope John Paul II was the next Pope to visit Australia in 1986. At Alice Springs, the Pope made an historic address to indigenous Australians, in which he praised the enduring qualities of Aboriginal culture, lamented the effects of dispossession of and discrimination; called for acknowledgment of Aboriginal land rights and reconciliation in Australia; and said that the church in Australia would not reach its potential until Aboriginal people had made their \\"contribution to her life and until that contribution has been joyfully received by others\\".[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, the Archbishop of Sydney, Edward Bede Clancy was created a cardinal and during the Australian Bicentenary celebrations led the religious ceremonies for the opening of Parliament House, Canberra. Pope John Paul II visited Australia for the second time in 1995, to perform the rite of beatification for Mary MacKillop, founder of Australia's Josephite Sisters, before a crowd of 250,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the late 1980s, cases of abuse within the Catholic Church and other child care institutions began to be exposed in Australia. In 1996, the church issued a document, Towards Healing, which it described as seeking to \\"establish a compassionate and just system for dealing with complaints of abuse\\".[68] In 2001, an apostolic exhortation from Pope John Paul II condemned incidents of sex abuse in Oceania.[69] Impetus for the Towards Healing protocols was in part led by Bishop Geoffrey Robinson, who would later call for large scale systemic reform of the church globally in his 2007 book Confronting Power and Sex in the Catholic Church: Reclaiming the Spirit of Jesus.[70] The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference did not endorse the book. Pat Power. the Auxiliary Bishop of Canberra & Goulburn, wrote in 2002 that \\"the current crisis around sexual abuse is the greatest since the Reformation. At stake is the Church's moral authority, its credibility, its ability to interpret the 'signs of the times' and its capacity to confront the ensuing questions.\\"[citation needed] Pope Benedict XVI officially apologised to victims during World Youth Day 2008 in Sydney and celebrated a Mass with four victims of clerical sexual abuse in the chapel of St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney and listened to their stories.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, in Rome, Pope John Paul II apologised to Aborigines and other indigenous people in Oceania for past injustices by the church: Aware of the shameful injustices done to indigenous peoples in Oceania, the Synod Fathers apologised unreservedly for the part played in these by members of the church, especially where children were forcibly separated from their families. Church leaders in Australia called on the Australian government to offer a similar apology.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001 George Pell became the eighth Archbishop of Sydney and, in 2003, became a cardinal. Pell supported Sydneys bid to host World Youth Day 2008. In July 2008, Sydney hosted the massive youth festival led by Pope Benedict XVI.[73][74] Around 500,000 welcomed the pope to Sydney and 270,000 watched the Stations of the Cross. More than 300,000 pilgrims camped out overnight in preparation for the final Mass.,[75] where final attendance was between 300,000 and 400,000 people.[76][77][78]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2010, Pope Benedict XVI announced that Mary MacKillop would be recognised as the first Australian saint of the Catholic Church.[79] She was canonised on 17 October 2010 during a public ceremony in St Peter's Square. An estimated 8,000 Australians were present in the Vatican City to witness the ceremony.[80] The Vatican Museum held an exhibition of Aboriginal art to honour the occasion titled \\"Rituals of Life\\".[81] The exhibition contained 300 artefacts which were on display for the first time since 1925.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nCatholic people and charitable organisations, hospitals and schools have played a prominent r?le in welfare and education in Australia ever since Colonial times when Catholic laywoman Caroline Chisholm helped single migrant women and rescued homeless girls in Sydney.[83] In his welcoming address to the Catholic World Youth Day 2008 in Sydney, the prime minister, Kevin Rudd, said that Christianity had been a positive influence on Australia: \\"It was the church that began first schools for the poor, it was the church that began first hospitals for the poor, it was the church that began first refuges for the poor and these great traditions continue for the future\\".[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of Catholic organisations are providers of social welfare services (including residential aged care and the Job Network) and education in Australia, Australia wide these include: Centacare, CatholicCare Caritas Australia, Jesuit Refugee Service, St Vincent de Paul Society, Youth Off The Streets. Two religious institutes founded in Australia which engaged in welfare and charity work are the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart and the Sisters of the Good Samaritan.[28] Many international Catholic religious institutes also work in welfare, such as the Little Sisters of the Poor who work in aged care. Catholic Social Services Australia is the peak body for Catholic welfare agencies and has 54 member organisations in metropolitan, regional and remote Australia.[85][86] Members include diocesan based Centacare and CatholicCare agencies and those under the stewardship of religious orders.\\r\\n\\r\\nCatholic Health Australia is the largest non-government provider grouping of health, community and aged care services in Australia. These do not operate for profit and range across the full spectrum of health services, representing about 10% of the health sector and employing 35,000 people.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nReligious institutes founded many of Australia's hospitals. Irish Sisters of Charity arrived in Sydney in 1838 and established St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney in 1857 as a free hospital for the poor. The Sisters went on to found hospitals, hospices, research institutes and aged care facilities in Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania.[88] At  St Vincent's they trained leading surgeon Victor Chang and opened Australia's first AIDS clinic.[89]  In the 21st century, with more and more lay people involved in management, the sisters began callaborating with Sisters of Mercy Hospitals in Melbourne and Sydney. Jointly the group operates four public hospitals; seven private hospitals and 10 aged care facilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English Sisters of the Little Company of Mary arrived in 1885 and have since established public and private hospitals, retirement living and residential aged care, community care and comprehensive palliative care in New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Queensland (Cairns) and the Northern Territory.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor, who follow the charism of Saint Jeanne Jugan to \\"offer hospitality to the needy aged\\" arrived in Melbourne in 1884 and now operate four aged care homes in Australia.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1833, there were around ten Catholic schools in the Australian colonies.[28] Today one in five Australian students attend Catholic schools.[3] There are over 1700 Catholic schools in Australia with more than 750,000 students enrolled, employing almost 60,000 teachers.[93] Mary MacKillop was a 19th-century Australian nun who founded an educational religious institute, the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart.[94] Other Catholic religious institutes involved in education in Australia have included: Sisters of Mercy, Marist Brothers, Christian Brothers, Loreto Sisters, Benedictine Sisters and Jesuits.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with other classes of non-government schools in Australia, Catholic schools receive funding from the Commonwealth Government.[95] Church schools range from elite, high cost schools (which generally offer extensive bursary programs for low-income students) to low-fee local schools. Notable schools include the Jesuit colleges of St Aloysius and Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview in Sydney, Saint Ignatius' College, Adelaide and Xavier College in Melbourne; the Marist Brothers St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill, the Christian Brothers' High School, Lewisham, the Society of the Sacred Heart's Rosebay Kincoppal School, the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary's Loreto Kirribilli, the Sisters of Mercy's Monte Sant' Angelo Mercy College, the Christian Brothers' St Edmund's College, Canberra and Aquinas College, Perth ÿ however, the list and range of Catholic primary and secondary schools in Australia is long and diverse and extends throughout metropolitan, regional and remote Australia: see Catholic Schools in Australia\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Catholic University opened in 1991 following the amalgamation of four Catholic tertiary institutions in eastern Australia. These institutions had their origins in the 1800s, when religious institutes became involved in preparing teachers for Catholic schools and nurses for Catholic hospitals.[96] The University of Notre Dame Australia opened  in Western Australia in December 1989 and now has over 9000 students on three campuses in Fremantle, Sydney and Broome.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nChurch leaders have often involved themselves in political issues in areas they consider relevant to Christian teachings. In early Colonial times, Catholicism was restricted but Church of England clergy  worked closely with the governors.[98] Early Catholic missionary William Ullathorne criticised the convict system, publishing a pamphlet, The Horrors of Transportation Briefly Unfolded to the People, in Britain in 1837.[99] Sydney's first archbishop, John Bede Polding, was influential in the preparation of the Australian bishops' pastoral letter on Aborigines in 1869 which advocated for Aboriginal rights and dignity.[100] Australia's first Catholic cardinal, Patrick Francis Moran (1830ÿ1911), was politically active. He was a proponent of Australian Federation; he denounced anti-Chinese legislation as \\"unchristian\\" and opposed anti-semitism. He became an advocate for women's suffrage and he stood for election to the Australasian Federal Convention in 1897, but in 1901 he refused to attend the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia because precedence was given to the Church of England. He alarmed conservatives by supporting trade unionism and \\"Australian socialism\\".[47]  Archbishop Daniel Mannix of Melbourne was a controversial voice against conscription during World War I and against British policy in Ireland.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nMum (Shirl) Smith, a celebrated Redfern community worker who, assisted by the Sisters of Charity, worked in the courts and organised prison visitations, medical and social assistance for Aborigines.[101] Fr Ted Kennedy of Redfern[62] and Fr Frank Brennan, a Jesuit, have been high-profile Catholic priests engaged in the cause of Aboriginal rights.[102][103][104]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Labor Party had largely been supported by Catholics until layman B. A. Santamaria formed the Democratic Labor Party over concerns of Communist influence over the trade union movement in the 1950s.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999, Cardinal Edward Bede Clancy wrote to the then prime minister, John Howard, urging him to send an armed peacekeeping force to East Timor to end the violence engulfing that country.[106] In 2006, an Australian Greens senator, Kerry Nettle, called on the health minister, Tony Abbott, to refrain from debating the abortion drug RU486 because he was Catholic.[107] Cardinal George Pell has concerned himself publicly with traditional issues of Christian doctrine, such as supporting marriage and opposing abortion, but also raised questions about government policies such as the Work Choices industrial relations reforms and the mandatory detention of asylum seekers.[108][109]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralia elected its first Catholic prime minister, James Scullin (Australian Labor Party), in 1929.[52] followed by Joseph Lyons, a former Labour Premier of Tasmania (1923 - 1928) and then prime minister from 1932 to 1939. The war-time prime minister, John Curtin (Labor), was raised Catholic. Ben Chifley (Labor) also served as prime minister from 1945ÿ1951.  In recent times, Labor prime ministers Paul Keating (1991ÿ1996) and Kevin Rudd (2007ÿ2010, 2013-2013) were both raised Catholic (though Rudd now identifies as an Anglican). The last three Liberal Party Leaders of the Opposition, Brendon Nelson, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull (current Prime Minister) are all Catholics. Tim Fischer, Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the National Party between 1996 and 1999, is a practising Catholic and served as the Australian Ambassador to the Holy See between 2008 and 2012.[110] Former Premiers of New South Wales, Kristina Keneally, studied theology,[111] and Barry O'Farrell are Catholics.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also \\r\\nMost towns in Australia have at least one Christian church. St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney follows a conventional English cathedral plan, cruciform in shape, with a tower over the crossing of the nave and transepts and twin towers at the west front with impressive stained glass windows. With a length of 106.7 metres (350?ft) and a general width of 24.4 metres (80?ft), it is Sydney's largest church. Built to a design by William Wardell from a foundation stone laid in 1868, the spires of the cathedral were not finally added until the year 2000. Wardell also worked on the design of St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne ÿ among the finest examples of ecclesiastical architecture in Australia.[113][114] Wardell's overall design was in Gothic Revival style, paying tribute to the mediaeval cathedrals of Europe. Largely constructed between 1858 and 1897, the nave was Early English in style, while the remainder of the building is in Decorated Gothic.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdelaide, the capital of South Australia has long been known as the City of Churches. 130 kilometres (81?mi) north of Adelaide is the Jesuit old stone winery and cellars at Sevenhill, founded by Austrian Jesuits in 1848.[115] A rare Australian example of Spanish missionary style exists at New Norcia, Western Australia, founded by Spanish Benedictine monks in 1846.[116][117] A number of notable Victorian era chapels and edifices were also constructed at church schools across Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with community attitudes to religion, church architecture changed significantly during the 20th century. St Monica's Cathedral in Cairns was designed by architect Ian Ferrier and built in 1967ÿ68 following the form of the original basilica model of the early churches of Rome, adapted to a tropical climate and to reflect the changes to Catholic liturgy mandated at Vatican II. The cathedral was dedicated as a memorial to the Battle of the Coral Sea which was fought east of Cairns in May 1942. The \\"Peace Window\\" stained glass was installed on the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II.[118][119] In the later 20th century, distinctly Australian approaches were applied at places such as Jamberoo Benedictine Abbey, where natural materials were chosen to \\"harmonise with the local environment\\" and the chapel sanctuary is of glass overlooking rainforest.[120] Similar design principles were applied at Thredbo Ecumenical Chapel built in the Snowy Mountains in 1996.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nSt Mary's Cathedral, Perth\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Norcia, Western Australia\\r\\n\\r\\nSt Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Ignatius' College, Riverview\\r\\n\\r\\nSt Francis Xavier's Cathedral, Adelaide\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cathedral of St Stephen, Brisbane\\r\\n\\r\\nSt Christopher's Cathedral, Canberra\\r\\n\\r\\nMary MacKillop Chapel, in North Sydney\\r\\n\\r\\nSt Joseph's College, Hunters Hill Chapel, 1940\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralian films on Catholic themes have included:\\r\\n\\r\\nTelevision programs on Catholic themes have included:\\r\\n\\r\\nCoverage of religion is part of the ABC's Charter[citation needed] obligation to reflect the character and diversity of the Australian community. Its religious programs include coverage of Catholic (and other) worship and devotion, explanation, analysis, debate and reports.[123] Catholic Church Television Australia is an office with the Australian Catholic Office for Film & Broadcasting and develops television programs for Aurora Community Television on Foxtel and Austar in Australia.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe body of literature produced by Australian Catholics is extensive. During colonial times, the Benedictine missionary William Ullathorne (1806ÿ1889) was a notable essayist writing against the Convict Transportation system. Later Cardinal Moran (1830ÿ1911), a noted historian, wrote a History of the Catholic Church in Australasia.[29] More recent Catholic histories of Australian include The Catholic Church and Community in Australia (1977) by Patrick O'Farrell and Australian Catholics (1987), by Edmund Campion.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable Catholic poets have included Christopher Brennan (1870ÿ1932); James McAuley (1917ÿ1976);[125] Bruce Dawe (born 1930) and Les Murray (born 1938). Murray and Dawe are among Australia's foremost contemporary poets, noted for their use of vernacular and everyday Australian themes. Emblematic of the Christian poets could be McCauley's rejection of Modernism in favour of Classical culture:[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Australian writers have examined the lives of Christian characters, or have been influenced by Catholic schooling. Australia's best selling novel of all time, The Thorn Birds by Colleen McCullough,  writes of the temptations encountered by a priest living in the Outback. Many contemporary Australian writers have attended or taught at Catholic schools, including Robert Hughes, Nick Enright, Brian Castro, Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner; Gerard Henderson, Miranda Devine, Kimberley Starr, Melina Marchetta, Melvyn Morrow, Justin Fleming, Gerard Windsor and Anh Do.\\r\\n\\r\\nCatholic news publications in Australia include: The Catholic Weekly from Sydney; The Catholic Leader, published by the Brisbane Archdiocese; and Eureka Street Magazine which is concerned with public affairs, arts, and theology and is run by the communication division of the Jesuit religious order.\\r\\n\\r\\nSt Mary's Cathedral Choir, Sydney is the oldest musical institution in Australia, from origins in 1817.[citation needed] Major Catholic raised recording artists from Johnny O'Keefe to Paul Kelly have recorded Christian spirituals. Paul Kelly's Meet Me in the Middle of the Air is based on Psalm 23.[128] Catholic nun Sister Janet Mead  achieved significant mainstream chart success. New South Wales Supreme Court Judge George Palmer was commissioned to compose the setting of the Mass for Sydney's World Youth Day 2008 Papal Mass. The Mass, Benedictus Qui Venit, for large choir, soloists and orchestra, was performed in the presence of Pope Benedict XVI and an audience of 350,000  with singing led by soprano Amelia Farrugia and tenor Andrew Goodwin. \\"Receive the Power\\", a song written by Guy Sebastian and Gary Pinto, was chosen as the official anthem for the XXIII World Youth Day (WYD08) held in Sydney in 2008.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralian Christmas carols like the Three Drovers or Christmas Day by John Wheeler and William G. James place the Christmas story in an Australian context of warm, dry Christmas winds and red dust and are popular at Catholic services. As the festival of Christmas falls during the Australian summer, Australians gather in large numbers for traditional open-air evening carol services and concerts in December, such as  Carols by Candlelight in Melbourne and Carols in the Domain in Sydney.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of Christian art in Australia began with the arrival of the first British settlers at the end of the 18th century. During the 19th century, Gothic Revival cathedrals were built in the colonial capitals, often containing stained glass art works, as can be seen at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney and St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne. Roy de Maistre (1894ÿ1968) was an Australian abstract artist who obtained renown in Britain, converted to Catholicism and painted notable religious works, including a series of Stations of the Cross for Westminster Cathedral in London. Among the most acclaimed of Australian painters of Catholic themes was Arthur Boyd. He painted a Biblical series, and created tapestries of the life of St Francis of Assisi. Influenced by both the European masters and the Heidelberg School of Australian landscape art, he placed the central characters of the Bible within Australian bush scenery, as in his portrait of Adam and Eve, The Expulsion (1948).[131] The artist Leonard French, who designed a stained glass ceiling of the National Gallery of Victoria, has drawn heavily on Christian story and symbolism through his career.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the Australians honoured by the Catholic Church to be saints or whose cause for canonisation is still being investiged include:\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin Australia the church hierarchy is made of metropolitan archdioceses and suffragan sees. Each diocese has a bishop, while each archdiocese is served by an archbishop. Australia has two living members of the College of Cardinals: the previous Archbishop of Sydney, George Pell, now posted to the Vatican in a role of financial oversight,  and Edward Idris Cassidy. The late Cardinal Edward Bede Clancy died on 3 August 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Catholic Bishops Conference is the national body of the bishops of Australia.[4] The president of the conference is Archbishop Denis Hart, who was elected to a two-year term in May 2012 and occasionally makes statements on behalf of the conference. The conference is served by a secretariat, based in Canberra, under the management of the Reverend Brian Lucas. The conference meets at least annually.[133]","input":"How many catholic churches are there in australia?"},{"output":"500 to 1,200 Marines in the battalion","context":"A battalion is a military unit. The use of the term \\"battalion\\" varies by nationality and branch of service. Typically a battalion consists of 300 to 800 soldiers and is divided into a number of companies. A battalion is typically commanded by a lieutenant colonel. In some countries, the word \\"battalion\\" is associated with the infantry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term was first used in Italian as battaglione no later than the 16th century. It derived from the Italian word for battle, battaglia. The first use of battalion in English was in the 1580s, and the first use to mean \\"part of a regiment\\" is from 1708.\\r\\n\\r\\nA battalion is the smallest military organization capable of \\"limited independent operations\\",[1] in that the battalion is the lowest-level organizational unit containing an organic coordinating, or executive, staff (i.e., S-1, S-2, etc.) and a support and services unit (e.g., headquarters and headquarters company). The battalion must have a source of re-supply to enable it to sustain operations for more than a few days. This is because a battalion's basic load of ammunition, expendable weapons (e.g., hand grenades and disposable rocket launchers), water, rations, fuel, lubricants, replacement parts, batteries, and medical supplies normally consists of only what the battalion's soldiers and the battalion's organic vehicles can carry.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to consisting of sufficient personnel and equipment (usually at least two primary mission companies and one mission support company) to perform significant operations, as well as a limited self-contained administrative and logistics capability, the commander is provided with a full-time staff whose function is to coordinate current operations and plan future operations. A battalion's subordinate units (companies and their organic platoons) are dependent upon the battalion headquarters for command, control, communications, and intelligence and the battalion's organic service and support structure to perform their mission. The battalion is usually part of a regiment, brigade, or group, depending on the organizational model used by that service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bulk of a battalion's companies are often homogeneous with respect to type (e.g., an infantry or tank battalion), although there are exceptions such as combined arms battalions in the U.S. Army. A battalion includes a headquarters company and some sort of combat service support, typically organized within a combat support company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term battalion is used in the British Army Infantry and some corps including the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, and intelligence corps. It was formerly used in the Royal Engineers (before they switched to regiments), and was also used in the now defunct Royal Army Ordnance Corps and Royal Pioneer Corps. Other corps usually use the term \\"regiment\\" instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn infantry battalion is numbered ordinarily within its regiment (e.g., 1st Battalion, The Rifles, usually referred to as 1?Rifles). It normally has a headquarters company, support company, and three rifle companies (usually, but not always, A, B and C companies). Each company is commanded by a major, the officer commanding (OC), with a captain or senior lieutenant as second-in-command (2IC). The HQ company contains signals, quartermaster, catering, intelligence, administration, pay, training, operations and medical elements. The support company usually contains anti-tank, machine gun, mortar, pioneer and reconnaissance platoons. Mechanised units usually have an attached light aid detachment (LAD) of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) to perform field repairs on vehicles and equipment. A British battalion in theatre during World War II had around 845 men, whereas, as of 2012, a British battalion had around 650 soldiers. With successive rounds of cutbacks after the war, many infantry regiments were reduced to a single battalion (others were amalgamated to form large regiments that maintained multiple battalions, e.g., the Royal Anglian Regiment).\\r\\n\\r\\nImportant figures in a battalion headquarters include:\\r\\n\\r\\nBattalions of other corps are given separate cardinal numbers within their corps (e.g., 101?Battalion REME).\\r\\n\\r\\nA battle group consists of an infantry battalion or armoured regiment with sub-units detached from other military units acting under the command of the battalion commander.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Canadian Forces, most battalions are reserve units of between 100ÿ200 soldiers that include an operationally ready, field-deployable component of approximately a half-company apiece. The nine regular force infantry battalions each contain three or four rifle companies and one or two support companies. Canadian battalions are generally commanded by lieutenant-colonels, though smaller reserve battalions may be commanded by majors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose regiments consisting of more than one battalion are:\\r\\n\\r\\nTactically, the Canadian battalion forms the core of the infantry battle group, which also includes various supporting elements such as armour, artillery, combat engineers and combat service support. An infantry battle group will typically be commanded by the commander of the core infantry battalion around which it is formed and can range in size from 300 to 1,500 or more soldiers, depending on the nature of the mission assigned.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Royal Netherlands Army, a mechanised infantry battalion usually consists of one command- and medical company, three mechanised infantry companies, and one support company, which has three platoons with heavy mortars and three platoons with anti-tank missiles (TOW). With the Dutch artillery units, the equivalent of a battalion is called an afdeling (which translates to \\"section\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nCombat companies consist of (usually mechanised) infantry, combat engineers, or tanks. In the latter case, the unit is called an eskadron, which translates roughly to \\"squadron\\". There are also support battalions in the Dutch Army, which specialise on a specific task: for example, supplies and transport or communications.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Netherlands have four battalions that are permanently reserved for the United Nations, for the purpose of peacekeeping duties.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn infantry battalion, logistical battalion, combat battalion, and the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps all have a battalion structure. Each battalion usually consists of the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the major reform of its armed forces in 2004, the Swiss Army abandoned the old regimental system and adopted a combat team approach centred on battalions as the building blocks of mission-oriented task forces. Battalion sizes vary between branches.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States Army, a battalion is a unit composed of a headquarters and two or more batteries, companies, or troops. They are normally identified by ordinal numbers (1st Battalion, 2nd Squadron, etc.) and normally have subordinate units that are identified by single letters (Battery?A, Company?A, Troop?A, etc.). Battalions are tactical and administrative organizations with a limited capability to plan and conduct independent operations and are normally organic components of brigades, groups, or regiments.\\r\\n\\r\\nA US Army battalion includes the battalion commander (lieutenant colonel), executive officer (major), command sergeant major (CSM), headquarters staff, and usually three to five companies, with a total of 300 to 1,200 soldiers. A regiment consists of between two and six organic battalions, while a brigade consists of between three and seven separate battalions.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the American Civil War, an infantry or cavalry battalion was an ad hoc grouping of companies from the parent regiment (which had ten companies, A through K, minus J as described below), except for certain regular infantry regiments, which were formally organized into three battalions of six companies each (numbered 1ÿ6 per battalion vice sequential letter designations). After 1882, cavalry battalions were renamed squadrons and cavalry companies were renamed troops. Artillery battalions typically comprised four or more batteries, although this number fluctuated considerably.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, most infantry regiments consisted of three battalions (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) with each battalion consisting of three rifle companies and a heavy weapons company. That is, rifle companies A, B, C along with heavy weapons Company?D were part of the 1st battalion, rifle companies?E, F, G, and heavy weapons Company?H constituted the 2nd battalion, and rifle companies I, K, L, and heavy weapons Company?M were in the 3rd. There was no J?Company: the letter J was traditionally not used because in 18th and 19th centuries old-style type, the capital letters I and J looked alike, and were therefore easily confused with one another. It was common for a battalion to become temporarily attached to a different regiment. For example, during the confusion and high casualty rates of both the Normandy Landings and the Battle of the Bulge, in order to bolster the strength of a depleted infantry regiment, companies and even battalions were moved around as necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US Army also created independent tank battalions to attach to infantry divisions during World War II in order to give them fire support.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 1960s through the early 1980s, a typical maneuver (infantry or tank) battalion had five companies: headquarters and headquarters company (HHC) and A, B, and C?Companies, plus a combat support company (CSC), with a scout platoon, 4.2 inch heavy mortar platoon, along with other elements that varied between organizations. These included heavy anti-tank TOW missile platoons, ground surveillance radar sections and Man-portable air-defense system sections. Beginning in the early 1980s, some elements of the combat support companies (the mortar and scout platoons) were merged into the headquarters company with the staff and support elements, others were moved to their parent type organization (ground surveillance radar and air defense), and in infantry battalions the heavy anti-tank missile platoon was organized as a separate company (E?Company). In the late 1980s, there was a fourth \\"line\\" company added (D?Company) in most infantry and tank battalions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this older structure, U.S. Army mechanized infantry battalions and tank battalions, for tactical purposes, task-organized companies to each other, forming a battalion-sized task force (TF).\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in 2005ÿ2006, the U.S. Army's mechanized and tank battalions were reorganized into combined arms battalions (CABs). Tank battalions and mechanized infantry battalions no longer exist. These new combined arms battalions are modular units, each consisting of a headquarters company, two mechanized infantry companies, two armor companies, and a forward support company attached from the battalion's parent brigade support battalion. This new structure eliminated the need to task-organize companies between battalions; each combined arms battalion was organically composed of the requisite companies. At a higher level, each armored brigade (formerly designated as a heavy brigade) is now composed of three CABs (vs. the two CABs of a former heavy brigade), an armored reconnaissance squadron, a fires battalion (field artillery), a brigade engineer battalion (BEB), and a brigade support battalion (BSB).\\r\\n\\r\\nA United States Marine Corps battalion includes the battalion headquarters, consisting of the commanding officer (usually a lieutenant colonel, sometimes a colonel), an executive officer (the second-in-command, usually a major), the sergeant major, and the executive staff (S-1 through S-4 and S-6). The battalion headquarters is supported by a headquarters and service company (battery). A battalion usually contains two to five organic companies (batteries in the artillery), with a total of 500 to 1,200 Marines in the battalion. A regiment consists of a regimental headquarters, a headquarters company (or battery), and two to five organic battalions (Marine infantry regiments ÿ three battalions of infantry; Marine artillery regiments ÿ three to five battalions of artillery; Marine combat logistics regiments ÿ one to three combat logistics battalions). In the U.S. Marine Corps, the brigade designation is used only in \\"Marine Expeditionary Brigade\\" (MEB). An MEB is one of the standard Marine Air-Ground Task Forces (MAGTF), is commanded by a brigadier general or major general, and consists of command element, a ground combat element (usually one reinforced Marine infantry regiment), an aviation combat element (a reinforced Marine aircraft group including rotary wing, fixed wing, and tiltrotor aircraft), and a combat logistics element (a Marine combat logistics regiment, which includes naval construction forces [Seabees] and naval medical elements).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the U.S. Marine Corps, an infantry or \\"rifle\\" battalion typically consists of a headquarters and service company, three rifle, or \\"line\\", companies (designated alphabetically A through M depending upon which battalion of the parent regiment to which they are attached) and a weapons company. Weapons companies do not receive a letter designation. Marine infantry regiments use battalion and company designations as described above under World War II, with company letters D, H, and M not normally used but rather held in reserve for use in augmenting a fourth rifle company into each battalion as needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnited States Marine Corps infantry battalions are task organized into Battalion Landing Teams (BLTs) as the ground combat element (GCE) of a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). A standard U.S. Marine infantry battalion is typically supported by an artillery battery and a platoon each of tanks, amphibious assault vehicles, light armored reconnaissance vehicles, reconnaissance Marines, and combat engineers. The battalion structure is designed to readily expand to include a fourth rifle company, if required, as described above under battalion organization. Often Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company (ANGLICO) officers are assigned to the battalion, to coordinate naval gunfire support.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Navy has construction battalions and navy cargo handling battalions. They are structured roughly analogous to an army or marine corps battalion with staff and commanding officers of similar grade and experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Soviet Armed Forces, a motorised rifle battalion could be mounted in either BTR armoured personnel carriers or BMP infantry fighting vehicles, with the former being more numerous into the late 1980s. Both consisted of a battalion headquarters of 12 personnel and three motorised rifle companies of 110 personnel each, along with a number of combat support units: a mortar battery consisting of eight 120mm 120-PM-43 mortars or automatic 82mm 2B9 Vasileks, an air defense platoon with nine MANPADs, either the SA-7 Grail, SA-14 Gremlin or SA-16 Gimlet, and an automatic grenade launcher platoon with six 30mm AGS-17 launchers. The BTR battalion also featured an anti-tank platoon with four AT-3 Sagger or AT-4 Spigot launchers and two 73mm SPG-9 recoilless guns; BTR units on high-readiness status sometimes had six missile launchers and three recoilless guns. Both featured the same support units as well, with a signal platoon, supply platoon, repair workshop and medical aid station. The addition of the antitank platoon meant that a BTR battalion at full strength was 525 personnel and 60 BTRs, including three command variants, while a BMP battalion consisted of 497 personnel and 45 BMPs, including three command variants.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the late 1980s, Soviet tank battalions consisted of three tank companies of 13 T-64, T-72 or T-80 tanks each, along with a battalion headquarters mounted in a command tank and a headquarters and service platoon, for a total of 165 personnel and 40 tanks; battalions using the older T-54, T-55 or T-62s tanks had 31 or 40 additional enlisted personnel. However, forces in Eastern Europe began to standardize to a smaller formation with 135 personnel and 31 tanks total, with each tank company consisting of 10 tanks total.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA Soviet artillery battalion in the late 1980s consisted of a battalion headquarters, a headquarters platoon, a maintenance and supply platoon and three firing batteries, each with six artillery pieces, whether the self-propelled 2S1 Gvozdikas or the towed D-30 howitzers, and numbering 260 personnel or 240 personnel respectively. Rocket launcher artillery battalions consisted of a headquarters and headquarters platoon, a service battery and three firing batteries equipped with BM-21 Grads for a total of 255 personnel.[6][7]","input":"How many marines are there in a battalion?"},{"output":"July 26, 1788","context":"","input":"When did new york state became a state?"},{"output":"season eight","context":"Murder, She Wrote is an American crime drama television series starring Angela Lansbury as mystery writer and amateur detective Jessica Fletcher.[4][5] The series aired for 12 seasons with 264 episodes from 1984 to 1996 on the CBS network.

In 2009, a point-and-click video game was released for the PC platform,[8] followed in 2012 by a sequel.[9] A spin-off book series, written by Donald Bain, continues publication at present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSeries producers Peter S. Fischer, Richard Levinson and William Link thought Lansbury would be perfect for the part of Jessica Fletcher but did not think that she would be interested in a television series. Earlier, she had acted in two film adaptations of Agatha Christie's mystery novels: as Salome Otterbourne in Death on the Nile and as the famous sleuth Miss Marple in The Mirror Crack'd (1980). When the latter film did poorlydespite an all star cast including Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, Kim Novak, and Tony Curtisthe offer for Lansbury to reprise Miss Marple in three more films never materialized.[10]\\r\\nWhen she made it known she would be available if the right project came along, the trio of creators sent her the script and almost immediately, Lansbury felt she could do something with the role of Jessica Fletcher. With Murder, She Wrote debuting on Sunday, September 30, 1984, the producers were able to parlay their \\"mystery writer/amateur detective\\" premise into a 12-year hit for CBS. It also made Lansbury, known previously for her motion picture and Broadway stage work, a household name for millions of television viewers. The title comes from Murder, She Said, which was the title of a 1961 film adaptation of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple novel 4:50 from Paddington.\\r\\nThe show revolves around the day-to-day life of Jessica Fletcher, a childless, widowed, retired English teacher who becomes a successful mystery writer. Despite fame and fortune, Jessica remains a resident of Cabot Cove, a small coastal community in Maine, and maintains her links with all of her old friends, never letting her success go to her head. Exterior shots of Cabot Cove were filmed in Mendocino, California. The fictional \\"Cabot Cove\\" name for the series' coastal town was derived from the name of an actual bay harbor inlet in Kennebunkport, Maine, located near the town's center, on the road where motels and lobster shack dives are located.\\r\\nThe show mostly starts with a preview of the episode's events, with Jessica stating: \\"Tonight On Murder, She Wrote...\\" Jessica invariably proves more perceptive than the official investigators of a case, who are almost always willing to arrest the most likely suspect. By carefully piecing the clues together and asking astute questions, she always manages to trap the real murderer. Murder occurred with such regularity in her vicinity that the term \\"Cabot Cove syndrome\\" was coined to describe the constant appearance of dead bodies in remote locations. Indeed, if Cabot Cove existed in real life, it would top the FBI's national crime statistics in numerous categories, with some analysis suggesting that the homicide rate in Cabot Cove exceeds even that of the real-life murder capital of the world.[11] Fan theories have even arisen that Jessica herself is murdering these people since there is no better explanation for the sheer number of murders she encounters throughout the long run of the series besides her involvement in all of them.[12]\\r\\nJessica's relationship with law enforcement officials varies from place to place. Both sheriffs of Cabot Cove resign themselves to having her meddle in their cases. However, most detectives and police officers do not want her anywhere near their crime scenes, until her accurate deductions convince them to listen to her. Some are happy to have her assistance from the start, often because they are fans of her books. With time, she makes friends in many police departments across the U.S., as well as with a British police officer attached to Scotland Yard. At the start of season eight, more of the stories were set in New York City with Jessica moving into an apartment there part-time in order to teach criminology.\\r\\nSome programmes appeared to allegorise contemporaneous events. For example, the Season 5 (1988-89) Episode (No. 102) \\"From Russia With Blood\\" could represent the Soviet Union's beginnings on introducing Glasnost and Perestroika.[13]\\r\\nBy August 1988, when Lansbury expressed weariness of her commitment, the series was expected to end in May 1989. Nevertheless, she continued in the role, with a few changes made. For the next two seasons, Lansbury reduced her appearances in several episodes, only appearing at the beginning and the end, to introduce stories starring several friends of Jessica, like PI Harry McGraw, reformed thief Dennis Stanton or MI5 agent Michael Hagarty. The \\"experiment\\" ended in 1991.[14]\\r\\nBy the end of the 1994ÿ95 season, Murder, She Wrote's 11th season, CBS moved the network's then-longest-running weekly series to Thursday nights at 8 p.m. This put the series in direct competition with the first hour of NBC's Must See TV lineup, which had been drawing the highest ratings of the week for any network for years. Despite protests of many of the show's fans (who believed CBS was intentionally setting the show up to fail in its new timeslot), CBS refused to budge on the new timeslot. Murder, She Wrote plummeted from eighth to 58th in the yearly ratings; the series lost nearly 6 million viewers as the audience was not willing to follow it to Thursday, which left CBS with little choice but to end Murder, She Wrote after 12 seasons in August 1996.\\r\\nTo soften the blow, the network agreed to air the final four episodes in its original Sunday night timeslot, as well as commission four Murder, She Wrote movies over the next few years: the first was South by Southwest (1997), with three more following as A Story to Die For (2000), The Last Free Man (2001), and The Celtic Riddle (2003).[15]\\r\\nLansbury stated in May 2011 that she would like to make a comeback appearance as Jessica Fletcher.[16]\\r\\nHowever, in a 2015 interview, Lansbury quashed the idea of reprising the much beloved character stating, \\"I think it would be a downer. In some way, wed have to show her as a much older woman, and I think its better to maintain that picture we have in our minds eye of her as a vigorous person. Im still pretty vigorous, especially in the garden  but if I wanted to transform myself back into the woman I looked like then, it would be ridiculous. And I can't do that.\\"[17] She then expressed interest in revisiting the character again in 2017.[18]\\r\\nThe episode of Magnum, P.I. entitled \\"Magnum on Ice\\" concludes a crossover that begins on the earlier Magnum, P.I. episode \\"Novel Connection\\". In the episode's plot, Jessica comes to Hawaii to investigate an attempt to murder Robin Masters' guests, then tries to clear Magnum when he's accused of killing the hitman.[citation needed]\\r\\nOver its twelve-year run Murder, She Wrote received numerous award nominations. Lansbury herself holds the record for the most Emmy nominations for outstanding lead actress in a drama series with twelve, one for each season. She never won, which is also a record. Mary Dodson, the art director for 102 of the series' 264 episodes, received three Emmy nominations for her work on Murder, She Wrote.[19]\\r\\nMurder, She Wrote maintained extremely high ratings finishing in the top 15 of shows for eleven of its 12 seasons (eight of which it was in the top 10), even well into its late seasons. By its 11th season, Murder, She Wrote was still averaging 25 million viewers per week. However, at the beginning of its 12th season in 1995, CBS moved the show from its extremely popular Sunday night time slot to Thursday night forcing it to compete with NBC's Must See TV line up, and as a result the ratings plummeted. The show rated as the following:\\r\\nDeadline Hollywood reported in October 2013 that NBC was planning a reboot of the series, starring Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer as a \\"hospital administrator and amateur sleuth who self-publishes her first mystery novel.\\"[33]\\r\\nLansbury commented that she was not a fan of using the title, saying \\"I think it's a mistake to call it 'Murder, She Wrote,' because 'Murder, She Wrote' will always be about Cabot Cove and this wonderful little group of people who told those lovely stories and enjoyed a piece of that place, and also enjoyed Jessica Fletcher, who is a rare and very individual kind of person.\\" Early on it was decided by producers that Spencer's character would not be named Jessica Fletcher, for only Lansbury could play Jessica Fletcher.[34] It was announced on January 21, 2014, that the reboot would not be going forward.[35]\\r\\nSince its original run on CBS, Murder, She Wrote has been syndicated in many countries around the world.\\r\\nIn 1985, Warren Company released a Murder, She Wrote board game. In the game, one player takes the hidden role of a killer and the other players try to determine which player is the killer through deduction. The killer is successful if he or she can kill five of the characters on the game-board and escape, while the detective players win by correctly deducing the identity of the killer.\\r\\nIn December 2009, casual game developer and publisher Legacy Interactive, under license with Universal Pictures Digital Platforms Group (UPDPG), announced the release a PC and Macintosh video game based on the television series. In the game, players help Jessica Fletcher to solve five unusual murders.[39][40] A sequel, Murder She Wrote 2, was launched by Legacy Interactive in November 2012.[41]","input":"When does jessica fletcher moved to new york?"},{"output":"Nearly 80% of total electricity generated (utility and captive)","context":"Energy in India describes energy and electricity production, consumption and import in India.

Kush was centered at Napata during its early phase. After Kashta (\\"the Kushite\\") invaded Egypt in the 8th century BC, the monarchs of Kush were also the pharaohs of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt, until they were expelled by the Neo-Assyrian Empire under the rule of Esarhaddon a century later.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring classical antiquity, the Kushite imperial capital was located at Mero?. In early Greek geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as Aethiopia. The Kingdom of Kush with its capital at Meroe persisted until the 4th century AD, when it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion. The seat was eventually captured and burnt to the ground by the Kingdom of Aksum. Afterwards the Nubians established the three, eventually Christianized, kingdoms of Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe native name of the Kingdom was recorded in Egyptian as k3?, likely pronounced /ku?u?/ or /ku?u?/ in Middle Egyptian when the term is first used for Nubia, based on the New Kingdom-era Akkadian transliteration as the genitive ksi.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also an ethnic term for the native population who initiated the kingdom of Kush. The term is also displayed in the names of Kushite persons,[7] such as King Kashta (a transcription of k3?-t3 \\"(one from) the land of Kush\\"). Geographically, Kush referred to the region south of the first cataract in general. Kush also was the home of the rulers of the 25th dynasty.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Kush, since at least the time of Josephus, has been connected with the biblical character Cush, in the Hebrew Bible (Hebrew: ???), son of Ham (Genesis 10:6). Ham had four sons named: Cush, Put, Canaan and Mizraim (Hebrew name for Egypt). According to the Bible, Nimrod, a son of Cush, was the founder and king of Babylon, Erech, Akkad and Calneh, in Shinar (Gen 10:10).[9] The Bible also makes reference to someone named Cush who is a Benjamite (Psalms 7:1, KJV).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome modern scholars, such as Friedrich Delitzsch,[11] have suggested that the biblical Cush might be linked to the Kassites of the Zagros Mountains (modern Iran).[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nMentuhotep II, the 21st century BC founder of the Middle Kingdom, is recorded to have undertaken campaigns against Kush in the 29th and 31st years of his reign. This is the earliest Egyptian reference to Kush; the Nubian region had gone by other names in the Old Kingdom.[13] Under Thutmose I, Egypt made several campaigns south.[14] This eventually resulted in their annexation of Nubia circa 1504 BC. After the conquest, Kerma culture was increasingly Egyptianized, yet rebellions continued for 220 years until c. 1300 BC. During the New Kingdom, Nubia nevertheless became a key province of the New Kingdom, economically, politically and spiritually. Indeed, major Pharonic ceremonies were held at Jebel Barkal near Napata.[15] As an Egyptian colony from the 16th century BC, Nubia (\\"Kush\\") was governed by an Egyptian Viceroy of Kush. With the disintegration of the New Kingdom around 1070 BC, Kush became an independent kingdom centered at Napata in modern northern Sudan.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extent of cultural/political continuity between the Kerma culture and the chronologically succeeding Kingdom of Kush is difficult to determine. The latter polity began to emerge around 1000 BC, 500 years after the end of the Kingdom of Kerma. By 1200 BC, Egyptian involvement in the Dongola Reach was nonexistent. By the 8th century BC, the new Kushite kingdom emerged from the Napata region of the upper Dongola Reach. The first Napatan king, Alara, dedicated his sister to the cult of Amun at the rebuilt Kawa temple, while temples were also rebuilt at Barkal and Kerma. A Kashta stele at Elephantine, places the Kushites on the Egyptian frontier by the mid-eighteenth century. This first period of the kingdom's history, the 'Napatan', was succeeded by the 'Meroitic', when the royal cemeteries relocated to Meroe around 300 BC.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kushites buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves. Archaeologists refer to these practices as the \\"Pan-grave culture\\".[18] This was given its name due to the way in which the remains are buried. They would dig a pit and put stones around them in a circle.[19] Kushites also built burial mounds and pyramids, and shared some of the same gods worshiped in Egypt, especially Ammon and Isis. With the worshiping of these gods the Kushites began to take some of the names of the gods as their throne names.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kush rulers were regarded as guardians of the state religion and were responsible for maintaining the houses of the gods. Some scholars[who?] believe the economy in the Kingdom of Kush was a redistributive system. The state would collect taxes in the form of surplus produce and would redistribute to the people. Others believe that most of the society worked on the land and required nothing from the state and did not contribute to the state. Northern Kush seemed to be more productive and wealthier than the Southern area.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nDental trait analysis of fossils dating from the Meroitic period in Semna, Nubia, found that they were closely related to Afroasiatic-speaking populations inhabiting the Nile, Horn of Africa, Maghreb and Canary Islands. The Meroitic skeletons and these ancient and recent fossils were also phenotypically distinct from those belonging to recent NigerÿCongo, Nilo-Saharan and Khoisan-speaking populations in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as from the Mesolithic inhabitants of Jebel Sahaba in Nubia.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nResistance to the early eighteenth Dynasty Egyptian rule by neighbouring Kush is evidenced in the writings of Ahmose, son of Ebana, an Egyptian warrior who served under Nebpehtrya Ahmose (1539-1514 BC), Djeserkara Amenhotep I (1514ÿ1493 BC) and Aakheperkara Thutmose I (1493ÿ1481 BC). At the end of the Second Intermediate Period (mid-sixteenth century BC), Egypt faced the twin existential threatsthe Hyksos in the North and the Kushites in the South. Taken from the autobiographical inscriptions on the walls of his tomb-chapel, the Egyptians undertook campaigns to defeat Kush and conquer Nubia under the rule of Amenhotep I (1514ÿ1493 BC). In Ahmose's writings, the Kushites are described as archers, \\"Now after his Majesty had slain the Bedoin of Asia, he sailed upstream to Upper Nubia to destroy the Nubian bowmen.\\"[22] The tomb writings contain two other references to the Nubian bowmen of Kush.\\r\\n\\r\\nEgypt's international prestige had declined considerably towards the end of the Third Intermediate Period. Its historical allies, the inhabitants of Canaan, had fallen to the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365-1020 BC), and then the resurgent Neo-Assyrian Empire (935ÿ605 BC). The Assyrians, from the 10th century BC onwards, had once more expanded from northern Mesopotamia, and conquered a vast empire, including the whole of the Near East, and much of Anatolia, the eastern Mediterranean, the Caucasus and early Iron Age Iran.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 945 BC, Shoshenq I and Libu princes took control of the Nile Delta and founded the Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt, also known as the Libyan or Bubastite dynasty, which would rule for some 200?years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions. In 711, Shoshenq made Memphis his northern capital.[23] However, Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in Leontopolis and Kushites threatened from the south.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlara founded the Napatan, or 25th, Kushite dynasty at Napata in Nubia, now Sudan. Alara's successor Kashta extended Kushite control north to Elephantine and Thebes in Upper Egypt. Kashta's successor Piye seized control of Lower Egypt around 727?BC.[24] Piye's 'Victory Stela', celebrating these campaigns between 728-716 BC, was found in the Amun temple at Jebel Barkal. He invaded an Egypt fragmented into four kingdoms, ruled by King Peftjauawybast, King Nimlot, King Iuput II, and King Osorkon IV.[25]:115,120\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy the Kushites chose to enter Egypt at this crucial point of foreign domination is subject to debate. Archaeologist Timothy Kendall offers his own hypotheses, connecting it to a claim of legitimacy associated with Jebel Barkal.[26] Kendall cites the Victory Stele of Piye at Jebel Barkal, which states that \\"Amun of Napata granted me to be ruler of every foreign country,\\" and \\"Amun in Thebes granted me to be ruler of the Black Land (Kmt)\\". According to Kendall, \\"foreign lands\\" in this regard seems to include Lower Egypt while \\"Kmt\\" seems to refer to a united Upper Egypt and Nubia.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nPiye's successor, Shabaqo, defeated the Saite kings of northern Egypt between 711-710 BC, and installed himself as king in Memphis. He then established ties with Sargon II.[25]:120\\r\\n\\r\\nPiye's son Taharqa enjoyed some minor initial success in his attempts to regain Egyptian influence in the Near East. He aided King Hezekiah from attack by Sennacherib and the Assyrians (2 Kings 19:9; Isaiah 37:9), however disease among the besieging Assyrian army appears to have been the main cause of failure to take Jerusalem rather than any military setback, and Assyrian records indicate Hezekiah was forced to pay tribute. The Assyrian King Sennacherib then defeated Taharqa and drove the Nubians and Egyptians from the region and back over the Sinai into Egypt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe power of the 25th Dynasty reached a climax under Taharqa. The Nile valley empire was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom. New prosperity[27] revived Egyptian culture.[28] Religion, the arts, and architecture were restored to their glorious Old, Middle, and New Kingdom forms. The Nubian pharaohs built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley, including Memphis, Karnak, Kawa, and Jebel Barkal.[29] It was during the 25th dynasty that the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids (many in modern Sudan) since the Middle Kingdom.[30][31][32] The Kushites developed their own script, the Meroitic alphabet, which was influenced by Egyptian writing systems circa 700ÿ600 BC, although it appears to have been wholly confined to the royal court and major temples.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nTaharqa initially defeated the Assyrians, when war broke out in 674 BC. Yet, in 671 BC, the Assyrian King Esarhaddon, took Memphis, and Taharqo retreated to the south, while his heir and other family members were taken to Assyria as prisoners. However, the native Egyptian vassal rulers installed by Esarhaddon as puppets were unable to effectively retain full control, and Taharqa was able regain control of Memphis. Esarhaddon's 669 BC campaign to once more eject Taharqa, was abandoned when Esarhaddon died in Palestine on the way to Egypt. Yet, Esarhaddon's successor, Ashurbanipal, did defeat Taharqa, and Taharqa died soon after.[25]:121\\r\\n\\r\\nTaharqa's successor Tantamani attempted to regain Egypt. He successfully defeated Necho, the subject ruler installed by Ashurbanipal, taking Thebes in the process. The Assyrians, who had a military presence in the north, then sent a large army southwards in 663 BC. Tantamani was routed, and the Assyrian army sacked Thebes to such an extent it never truly recovered. Tantamani was chased back to Nubia, and never threatened the Assyrian Empire again. A native Egyptian ruler, Psamtik I, was placed on the throne, as a vassal of Ashurbanipal.[27][34] The last links between Kush and Upper Egypt were severed after hostilities with the Saite kings in the 590s BC.[25]:121-122\\r\\n\\r\\nAspelta moved the capital to Mero?, considerably farther south than Napata, possibly in 591 BC.[35] It is also possible that Mero? had always been the Kushite capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartin Meredith states the Kushite rulers chose Mero?, between the Fifth and Sixth Cataracts, because it was on the fringe of the summer rainfall belt, and the area was rich in iron ore and hardwood for iron working. The location also afforded access to trade routes to the Red Sea. The Kush traded iron products with the Romans, in addition to gold, ivory and slaves. Yet, the Butana plain was stripped of its forests, leaving behind slag piles.[36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kushites used the animal-driven water wheel to increase productivity and create a surplus, particularly during the Napatan-Meroitic Kingdom.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nHerodotus mentioned an invasion of Kush by the Achaemenid ruler Cambyses (circa 530 BC), who possibly succeeded in occupying the area between the first and second Nile cataract.[39] Achaemenid inscriptions from both Egypt and Iran include Kush as part of the Achaemenid empire.[40] For example the DNa inscription of Darius I (reigned 522ÿ486 BC) on his tomb at Naqsh-e Rustam mentions K?ؐy (Old Persian cuneiform: ????????????, pronounced Kshؐy) among the territories being \\"ruled over\\" by the Achaemenid Empire.[41][40] Archaeological evidence suggests that the fortress of Dorginarti near the second cataract served as Persia's southern boundary.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn about 300 BC the move to Mero? was made more complete when the monarchs began to be buried there, instead of at Napata. One theory is that this represents the monarchs breaking away from the power of the priests at Napata. According to Diodorus Siculus, a Kushite king, \\"Ergamenes\\", defied the priests and had them slaughtered. This story may refer to the first ruler to be buried at Mero? with a similar name such as Arqamani,[44] who ruled many years after the royal cemetery was opened at Mero?. During this same period, Kushite authority may have extended some 1,500?km along the Nile River valley from the Egyptian frontier in the north to areas far south of modern Khartoum and probably also substantial territories to the east and west.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nKushite civilization continued for several centuries. In the Napatan Period Egyptian hieroglyphs were used: at this time writing seems to have been restricted to the court and temples. From the 2nd century BC there was a separate Meroitic writing system. This was an alphabetic script with 23 signs used in a hieroglyphic form (mainly on monumental art) and in a cursive form. The latter was widely used; so far some 1278 texts using this version are known (Leclant 2000). The script was deciphered by Griffith, but the language behind it is still a problem, with only a few words understood by modern scholars. It is not as yet possible to connect the Meroitic language with other known languages.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nStrabo describes a war with the Romans in the 1st century BC. After the initial victories of Kandake (or \\"Candace\\") Amanirenas against Roman Egypt, the Kushites were defeated and Napata sacked.[47] Remarkably, the destruction of the capital of Napata was not a crippling blow to the Kushites and did not frighten Candace enough to prevent her from again engaging in combat with the Roman military. Indeed, it seems that Petronius's attack might have had a revitalizing influence on the kingdom. Just three years later, in 22 BC, a large Kushite force moved northward with intention of attacking Qasr Ibrim.[48]:149\\r\\n\\r\\nAlerted to the advance, Petronius again marched south and managed to reach Qasr Ibrim and bolster its defences before the invading Kushites arrived. Although the ancient sources give no description of the ensuing battle, we know that at some point the Kushites sent ambassadors to negotiate a peace settlement with Petronius. By the end of the second campaign, however, Petronius was in no mood to deal further with the Kushites.[48]:149 The Kushites succeeded in negotiating a peace treaty on favourable terms[47] and trade between the two nations increased.[48]:149 Some historians like Theodore Mommsen wrote that during Augustus times Nubia was a possible client state of the Roman Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is possible that the Roman emperor Nero planned another attempt to conquer Kush before his death in AD 68.[48]:150ÿ151 Nero sent two centurions upriver as far as Bahr el Ghazal River in 66 CE in an attempt to discover the source of the Nile.[36]:43 Kush began to fade as a power by the 1st or 2nd century AD, sapped by the war with the Roman province of Egypt and the decline of its traditional industries.[49]\\r\\nChristianity began to gain over the old pharaonic religion and by the mid-sixth century AD the Kingdom of Kush was dissolved.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Meroitic language was spoken in Mero? and the Sudan during the Meroitic period (attested from 300 BC). It became extinct about 400 AD. The language was written in two forms of the Meroitic alphabet: Meroitic Cursive, which was written with a stylus and was used for general record-keeping; and Meroitic Hieroglyphic, which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is not well understood due to the scarcity of bilingual texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180ÿ170 BC. These hieroglyphics were found engraved on the temple of Queen Shanakdakhete. Meroitic Cursive is written horizontally, and reads from right to left like all Semitic orthographies.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 3rd century BC, a new indigenous alphabet, the Meroitic, consisting of twenty-three letters, replaced Egyptian script. Meroitic is an alphabet originally derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs that was used to write the Meroitic language of the Kingdom of Mero?/Kush. It was developed in the Napatan Period (about 700ÿ300 BCE), and first appears in the second century BCE. For a time, it was also possibly used to write the Old Nubian language of the successor Nubian kingdoms.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is uncertain to which language family the Meroitic language is related. Claude Rilly has proposed that it, like the Nobiin language, belongs to the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan family.[52][53] Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic, like the Egyptian language, instead belongs to the Afro-Asiatic family. She bases this on its sound inventory and phonotactics, which are similar to those of the Afro-Asiatic languages and dissimilar from those of the Nilo-Saharan languages.[54][55]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn account of the Kingdom of Kush's proximity to Ancient Egypt  the first cataract at Elephantine usually being considered the traditional border between the two polities  and because the 25th dynasty ruled over both states in the 8th century BC, from the Rift Valley to the Taurus mountains, historians have closely associated the study of Kush with Egyptology, in keeping with the general assumption that the complex sociopolitical development of Egypt's neighbours can be understood in terms of Egyptian models.[56] As a result, the political structure and organization of Kush as an independent ancient state has not received as thorough attention from scholars, and there remains much ambiguity especially surrounding the earliest periods of the state. Edwards[56] has suggested that study of the region could benefit from increased recognition of Kush as a state in its own right, with distinct cultural conditions, rather than merely as a secondary state on the periphery of Egypt.","input":"Where was the ancient kingdom of kush located?"},{"output":"the late 1970s","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nA microwave oven (also commonly referred to as a microwave) is an electric oven that heats and cooks food by exposing it to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer 25ÿ38 mm (1ÿ1.5 inches) of a homogeneous, high water content  food item; food is more evenly heated throughout than generally occurs in other cooking techniques.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe development of the cavity magnetron in the UK made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength (microwaves). American engineer Percy Spencer is generally credited with inventing the modern microwave oven after World War II from radar technology developed during the war. Named the \\"Radarange\\", it was first sold in 1946. Raytheon later licensed its patents for a home-use microwave oven that was first introduced by Tappan in 1955, but these units were still too large and expensive for general home use. Sharp Corporation introduced the first microwave oven with a turntable between 1964 and 1966. The countertop microwave oven was first introduced in 1967 by the Amana Corporation. After Sharp introduced low-cost microwave ovens affordable for residential use in the late 1970s, their use spread into commercial and residential kitchens around the world. In addition to their use in cooking food, types of microwave ovens are used for heating in many industrial processes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrowave ovens are a common kitchen appliance and are popular for reheating previously cooked foods and cooking a variety of foods. They are also useful for rapid heating of otherwise slowly prepared foodstuffs, which can easily burn or turn lumpy when cooked in conventional pans, such as hot butter, fats, chocolate or porridge. Unlike conventional ovens, microwave ovens usually do not directly brown or caramelize food, since they rarely attain the necessary temperatures to produce Maillard reactions. Exceptions occur in rare cases where the oven is used to heat frying-oil and other very oily items (such as bacon), which attain far higher temperatures than that of boiling water. \\r\\n\\r\\nMicrowave ovens have limited roles in professional cooking,[1] because the boiling-range temperatures of a microwave will not produce the flavorful chemical reactions that frying, browning, or baking at a higher temperature will. However, additional heat sources can be added to microwave ovens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exploitation of high-frequency radio waves for heating substances was made possible by the development of vacuum tube radio transmitters around 1920. By 1930 the application of short waves to heat human tissue had developed into the medical therapy of diathermy.  At the 1933 Chicago World's Fair, Westinghouse demonstrated the cooking of foods between two metal plates attached to a 10 kW, 60 MHz shortwave transmitter.[2]  The Westinghouse team, led by I. F. Mouromtseff, found that foods like steaks and potatoes could be cooked in minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1937 United States patent application by Bell Laboratories states:[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"This invention relates to heating systems for dielectric materials and the object of the invention is to heat such materials uniformly and substantially simultaneously throughout their mass. ... It has been proposed therefore to heat such materials simultaneously throughout their mass by means of the dielectric loss produced in them when they are subjected to a high voltage, high frequency field.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, lower-frequency dielectric heating, as described in the aforementioned patent, is (like induction heating) an electromagnetic heating effect, the result of the so-called near-field effects that exist in an electromagnetic cavity that is small compared with the wavelength of the electromagnetic field. This patent proposed radio frequency heating, at 10 to 20 megahertz (wavelength 15 to 30 meters).[4] Heating from microwaves that have a wavelength that is small relative to the cavity (as in a modern microwave oven) is due to \\"far-field\\" effects that are due to classical electromagnetic radiation that describes freely propagating light and microwaves suitably far from their source. Nevertheless, the primary heating effect of all types of electromagnetic fields at both radio and microwave frequencies occurs via the dielectric heating effect, as polarized molecules are affected by a rapidly alternating electric field.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe invention of the cavity magnetron made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength (microwaves). The magnetron was originally a crucial component in the development of short wavelength radar during World War II.[5] In 1937ÿ1940, a multi-cavity magnetron was built by the British physicist Sir John Turton Randall, FRSE, together with a team of British coworkers, for the British and American military radar installations in World War II.[6] A more high-powered microwave generator that worked at shorter wavelengths was needed, and in 1940, at the University of Birmingham in England, Randall and Harry Boot produced a working prototype.[7] They invented a valve that could spit out pulses of microwave radio energy on a wavelength of 10cm, an unprecedented discovery.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Henry Tizard travelled to the U.S. in late September 1940 to offer the magnetron in exchange for their financial and industrial help (see Tizard Mission).[6] An early 6 kW version, built in England by the General Electric Company Research Laboratories, Wembley, London, was given to the U.S. government in September 1940. The magnetron was later described by American historian James Phinney Baxter III as \\"[t]he most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores\\".[8] Contracts were awarded to Raytheon and other companies for mass production of the magnetron.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1945, the specific heating effect of a high-power microwave beam was accidentally discovered by Percy Spencer, an American self-taught engineer from Howland, Maine. Employed by Raytheon at the time, he noticed that microwaves from an active radar set he was working on started to melt a chocolate bar he had in his pocket. The first food deliberately cooked with Spencer's microwave was popcorn, and the second was an egg, which exploded in the face of one of the experimenters.[9][10] To verify his finding, Spencer created a high density electromagnetic field by feeding microwave power from a magnetron into a metal box from which it had no way to escape. When food was placed in the box with the microwave energy, the temperature of the food rose rapidly. On 8 October 1945, Raytheon filed a United States patent application for Spencer's microwave cooking process, and an oven that heated food using microwave energy from a magnetron was soon placed in a Boston restaurant for testing.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1947, Raytheon built the \\"Radarange\\", the first commercially available microwave oven.[12] It was almost 1.8 metres (5?ft 11?in) tall, weighed 340 kilograms (750?lb) and cost about US$5,000 ($55,000 in 2017 dollars) each. It consumed 3 kilowatts, about three times as much as today's microwave ovens, and was water-cooled. The name was the winning entry in an employee contest.[13] An early Radarange was installed (and remains) in the galley of the nuclear-powered passenger/cargo ship NS Savannah. An early commercial model introduced in 1954 consumed 1.6 kilowatts and sold for US$2,000 to US$3,000 ($18,000 to $27,000 in 2017 dollars). Raytheon licensed its technology to the Tappan Stove company of Mansfield, Ohio in 1952.[14] They tried to market a large 220 volt wall unit as a home microwave oven in 1955 for a price of US$1,295 ($12,000 in 2017 dollars), but it did not sell well.\\r\\n\\r\\nJapan's Sharp Corporation began manufacturing microwave ovens in 1961. Between 1964 and 1966, Sharp introduced the first microwave oven with a turntable, a feature that promotes convenient even heating of food.[15] In 1965, Raytheon acquired Amana. In 1967, they introduced the first popular home model, the countertop Radarange, at a price of US$495 ($4,000 in 2017 dollars).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s,[specify] Litton bought Studebaker's Franklin Manufacturing assets, which had been manufacturing magnetrons and building and selling microwave ovens similar to the Radarange. Litton then developed a new configuration of the microwave: the short, wide shape that is now common. The magnetron feed was also unique. This resulted in an oven that could survive a no-load condition: an empty microwave oven where there is nothing to absorb the microwaves. The new oven was shown at a trade show in Chicago,[citation needed] and helped begin a rapid growth of the market for home microwave ovens. Sales volume of 40,000 units for the U.S. industry in 1970 grew to one million by 1975. Market penetration was faster in Japan, due to a re-engineered magnetron allowing for less expensive units.\\r\\nSeveral other companies joined in the market, and for a time most systems were built by defense contractors, who were most familiar with the magnetron. Litton was particularly well known in the restaurant business.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the late 1970s, Japanese companies such as Sharp Corporation manufactured low-cost microwave ovens that were affordable for residential use, leading to the rapid expansion of the microwave oven market in the 1980s. After Japanese dominance for much of the 1980s, with Sharp as market leader, South Korean manufacturers began entering the market in the late 1980s, with Samsung becoming a major microwave manufacturer.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormerly found only in large industrial applications, microwave ovens increasingly became a standard fixture of residential kitchens in developed countries. By 1986, roughly 25% of households in the U.S. owned a microwave oven, up from only about 1% in 1971;[17] the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that over 90% of American households owned a microwave oven in 1997.[17][18] In Australia, a 2008 market research study found that 95% of kitchens contained a microwave oven and that 83% of them were used daily.[19] In Canada, fewer than 5% of households had a microwave oven in 1979, but more than 88% of households owned one by 1998.[20] In France, 40% of households owned a microwave oven in 1994, but that number had increased to 65% by 2004.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdoption has been slower in less-developed countries, as households with disposable income concentrate on more important household appliances like refrigerators and ovens. In India, for example, only about 5% of households owned a microwave in 2013, well behind refrigerators at 31% ownership.[22] However, microwave ovens are gaining popularity. In Russia, for example, the number of households with a microwave grew from almost 24% in 2002 to almost 40% in 2008.[23] Almost twice as many households in South Africa owned microwaves in 2008 (38.7%) as in 2002 (19.8%).[23] Microwave ownership in Vietnam was at 16% of households in 2008versus 30% ownership of refrigerators; this rate was up significantly from 6.7% microwave ownership in 2002, with 14% ownership for refrigerators that year.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nA microwave oven heats food by passing microwave radiation through it.  Microwaves are a form of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation with a frequency higher than ordinary radio waves but lower than infrared light.  Microwave ovens use frequencies in one of the ISM (industrial, scientific, medical) bands, which are reserved for this use, so they do not interfere with other vital radio services.   Consumer ovens usually use 2.45 gigahertz (GHz) It is a wavelength of 12.2 centimetres (4.80?in)while large industrial/commercial ovens often use 915 megahertz (MHz)32.8 centimetres (12.9?in).[24] Water, fat, and other substances in the food absorb energy from the microwaves in a process called dielectric heating. Many molecules (such as those of water) are electric dipoles, meaning that they have a partial positive charge at one end and a partial negative charge at the other, and therefore rotate as they try to align themselves with the alternating electric field of the microwaves. Rotating molecules hit other molecules and put them into motion, thus dispersing energy. This energy, dispersed as molecular rotations, vibrations and/or translations in solids and liquids raises the temperature of the food, in a process similar to heat transfer by contact with a hotter body[25]. \\r\\n\\r\\nMicrowave heating is more efficient on liquid water than on frozen water, where the movement of molecules is more restricted. Dielectric heating of liquid water is also temperature-dependent: At 0 C, dielectric loss is greatest at a field frequency of about 10 GHz, and for higher water temperatures at higher field frequencies.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nCompared to liquid water, microwave heating is less efficient on fats and sugars (which have a smaller molecular dipole moment).[27] Sugars and triglycerides (fats and oils) absorb microwaves due to the dipole moments of their hydroxyl groups or ester groups. However, due to the lower specific heat capacity of fats and oils and their higher vaporization temperature, they often attain much higher temperatures inside microwave ovens.[26] This can induce temperatures in oil or very fatty foods like bacon far above the boiling point of water, and high enough to induce some browning reactions, much in the manner of conventional broiling (UK: grilling), braising, or deep fat frying. Foods high in water content and with little oil rarely exceed the boiling temperature of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrowave heating can cause localized thermal runaways in some materials with low thermal conductivity which also have dielectric constants that increase with temperature. An example is glass, which can exhibit thermal runaway in a microwave to the point of melting if preheated. Additionally, microwaves can melt certain types of rocks, producing small quantities of molten rock.  Some ceramics can also be melted, and may even become clear upon cooling. Thermal runaway is more typical of electrically conductive liquids such as salty water.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nA common misconception is that microwave ovens cook food \\"from the inside out\\", meaning from the center of the entire mass of food outwards. This idea arises from heating behavior seen if an absorbent layer of water lies beneath a less absorbent drier layer at the surface of a food; in this case, the deposition of heat energy inside a food can exceed that on its surface. This can also occur if the inner layer has a lower heat capacity than the outer layer causing it to reach a higher temperature, or even if the inner layer is more thermally conductive than the outer layer making it feel hotter despite having a lower temperature. In most cases, however, with uniformly structured or reasonably homogenous food item, microwaves are absorbed in the outer layers of the item at a similar level to that of the inner layers. Depending on water content, the depth of initial heat deposition may be several centimetres or more with microwave ovens, in contrast to broiling/grilling (infrared) or convection heatingmethods which deposit heat thinly at the food surface. Penetration depth of microwaves is dependent on food composition and the frequency, with lower microwave frequencies (longer wavelengths) penetrating further.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA microwave oven converts a large portion of its electrical input into microwave energy. An average consumer microwave oven consumes 1100 W of electricity in producing 700 W of microwave power, an efficiency of 64%. The other 400 W are dissipated as heat, mostly in the magnetron tube.  Such wasted heat, along with heat from the product being microwaved, is exhausted as warm air through cooling vents. Additional power is used to operate the lamps, AC power transformer, magnetron cooling fan, food turntable motor and the control circuits, although the power consumed by the electronic control circuits of a modern microwave oven is negligible (< 1% of the input power) during cooking.\\r\\n\\r\\nA microwave oven consists of:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most ovens, the magnetron is driven by a linear transformer which can only feasibly be switched completely on or off. (One variant of the GE Spacemaker had two taps on the transformer primary, for high and low power modes.) Usually choice of power level doesn't affect intensity of the microwave radiation; instead, the magnetron is cycled on and off every few seconds, thus altering the large scale duty cycle. Newer models use inverter power supplies that use pulse-width modulation to provide effectively continuous heating at reduced power settings, so that foods are heated more evenly at a given power level and can be heated more quickly without being damaged by uneven heating.[29][30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe microwave frequencies used in microwave ovens are chosen based on regulatory and cost constraints. The first is that they should be in one of the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency bands set aside for unlicensed purposes. For household purposes, 2.45 GHz has the advantage over 915 MHz in that 915 MHz is only an ISM band in the ITU Region 2 while 2.45 GHz is available worldwide.[citation needed][vague] Three additional ISM bands exist in the microwave frequencies, but are not used for microwave cooking. Two of them are centered on 5.8 GHz and 24.125 GHz, but are not used for microwave cooking because of the very high cost of power generation at these frequencies. The third, centered on 433.92 MHz, is a narrow band that would require expensive equipment to generate sufficient power without creating interference outside the band, and is only available in some countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cooking chamber is similar to a Faraday cage to prevent the waves from coming out of the oven. Even though there is no continuous metal-to-metal contact around the rim of the door, choke connections on the door edges act like metal-to-metal contact, at the frequency of the microwaves, to prevent leakage. The oven door usually has a window for easy viewing, with a layer of conductive mesh some distance from the outer panel to maintain the shielding. Because the size of the perforations in the mesh is much less than the microwaves' wavelength (12.2 cm for the usual 2.45 GHz), microwave radiation cannot pass through the door, while visible light (with its much shorter wavelength) can.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern microwave ovens use either an analog dial-type timer or a digital control panel for operation. Control panels feature an LED, liquid crystal or vacuum fluorescent display, in the 90s brands such as Panasonic and GE began offering models with a scrolling-text display showing cooking instructions, numeric buttons for entering the cook time, a power level selection feature and other possible functions such as a defrost setting and pre-programmed settings for different food types, such as meat, fish, poultry, vegetables, frozen vegetables, frozen dinners, and popcorn. An audible warning such as a bell or a beeper is usually present to indicate that cooking has completed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrowave control panels are often considered awkward to use and are frequently employed as examples for user interface design.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nA variant of the conventional microwave is the convection microwave. A convection microwave oven is a combination of a standard microwave and a convection oven. It allows food to be cooked quickly, yet come out browned or crisped, as from a convection oven. Convection microwaves are more expensive than conventional microwave ovens. Some convection microwavesthose with exposed heating elementscan produce smoke and burning odors as food spatter from earlier microwave-only use is burned off the heating elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000,[33] some manufacturers began offering high power quartz halogen bulbs to their convection microwave models, marketing them under names such as \\"Speedcook\\", \\"Advantium\\", \\"Lightwave\\" and \\"Optimawave\\" to emphasize their ability to cook food rapidly and with good browning. The bulbs heat the food's surface with infrared (IR) radiation, browning surfaces as in a conventional oven. The food browns while also being heated by the microwave radiation and heated through conduction through contact with heated air. The IR energy which is delivered to the outer surface of food by the lamps is sufficient to initiate browning caramelization in foods primarily made up of carbohydrates and Maillard reactions in foods primarily made up of protein. These reactions in food produce a texture and taste similar to that typically expected of conventional oven cooking rather than the bland boiled and steamed taste that microwave-only cooking tends to create.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to aid browning, sometimes an accessory browning tray is used, usually composed of glass or porcelain. It makes food crisp by oxidizing the top layer until it turns brown. Ordinary plastic cookware is unsuitable for this purpose because it could melt.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrozen dinners, pies, and microwave popcorn bags often contain a susceptor made from thin aluminium film in the packaging or included on a small paper tray. The metal film absorbs microwave energy efficiently and consequently becomes extremely hot and radiates in the infrared, concentrating the heating of oil for popcorn or even browning surfaces of frozen foods. Heating packages or trays containing susceptors are designed for a single use and are then discarded as waste.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrowave ovens produce heat directly within the food, but despite the common misconception that microwaved food cooks from the inside out, 2.45 Ghz microwaves can only penetrate approximately 1 centimeter (0.39?in) into most foods. The inside portions of thicker foods are mainly heated by heat conducted from the outer 1 centimeter (0.39?in).[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nUneven heating in microwaved food can be partly due to the uneven distribution of microwave energy inside the oven, and partly due to the different rates of energy absorption in different parts of the food. The first problem is reduced by a stirrer, a type of fan that reflects microwave energy to different parts of the oven as it rotates, or by a turntable or carousel that turns the food; turntables, however, may still leave spots, such as the center of the oven, which receive uneven energy distribution. The location of dead spots and hot spots in a microwave can be mapped out by placing a damp piece of thermal paper in the oven. When the water saturated paper is subjected to the microwave radiation it becomes hot enough to cause the dye to be released which will provide a visual representation of the microwaves. If multiple layers of paper are constructed in the oven with a sufficient distance between them a three-dimensional map can be created. Many store receipts are printed on thermal paper which allows this to be easily done at home.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second problem is due to food composition and geometry, and must be addressed by the cook, by arranging the food so that it absorbs energy evenly, and periodically testing and shielding any parts of the food that overheat. In some materials with low thermal conductivity, where dielectric constant increases with temperature, microwave heating can cause localized thermal runaway. Under certain conditions, glass can exhibit thermal runaway in a microwave to the point of melting.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to this phenomenon, microwave ovens set at too-high power levels may even start to cook the edges of frozen food while the inside of the food remains frozen. Another case of uneven heating can be observed in baked goods containing berries. In these items, the berries absorb more energy than the drier surrounding bread and cannot dissipate the heat due to the low thermal conductivity of the bread. Often this results in overheating the berries relative to the rest of the food. \\"Defrost\\" oven settings use low power levels designed to allow time for heat to be conducted within frozen foods from areas that absorb heat more readily to those which heat more slowly. In turntable-equipped ovens, more even heating will take place by placing food off-centre on the turntable tray instead of exactly in the centre, assuming the food item so placed covers less of the center \\"dead zone\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are microwave ovens on the market that allow full-power defrosting.  They do this by exploiting the properties of the electromagnetic radiation LSM modes. LSM full-power defrosting may actually achieve more even results than slow defrosting.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrowave heating can be deliberately uneven by design. Some microwavable packages (notably pies) may include materials that contain ceramic or aluminium flakes, which are designed to absorb microwaves and heat up, which aids in baking or crust preparation by depositing more energy shallowly in these areas. Such ceramic patches affixed to cardboard are positioned next to the food, and are typically smokey blue or gray in colour, usually making them easily identifiable; the cardboard sleeves included with Hot Pockets, which have a silver surface on the inside, are a good example of such packaging. Microwavable cardboard packaging may also contain overhead ceramic patches which function in the same way. The technical term for such a microwave-absorbing patch is a susceptor.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nAny form of cooking will destroy some nutrients in food, but the key variables are how much water is used in the cooking, how long the food is cooked, and at what temperature.[40] Nutrients are primarily lost by leaching into cooking water, which tends to make microwave cooking healthier, given the shorter cooking times it requires.[41]  Like other heating methods, microwaving converts vitamin B12 from an active to inactive form; the amount of conversion depends on the temperature reached, as well as the cooking time. Boiled food reaches a maximum of 100?C (212?F) (the boiling point of water), whereas microwaved food can get locally hotter than this, leading to faster breakdown of vitamin B12. The higher rate of loss is partially offset by the shorter cooking times required.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpinach retains nearly all its folate when cooked in a microwave; in comparison, it loses about 77% when boiled, leaching out nutrients. Bacon cooked by microwave has significantly lower levels of carcinogenic nitrosamines than conventionally cooked bacon.[40] Steamed vegetables tend to maintain more nutrients when microwaved than when cooked on a stovetop.[40] Microwave blanching is 3ÿ4 times more effective than boiled water blanching in the retaining of the water-soluble vitamins folic acid, thiamin and riboflavin, with the exception of ascorbic acid, of which 28.8% is lost (vs. 16% with boiled water blanching).[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrowaving human milk at high temperatures is not recommended as it causes a marked decrease in activity of anti-infective factors.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll microwaves use a timer for the cooking time, at the end of cooking time, the oven switches itself off.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrowave ovens heat food without getting hot themselves. Taking a pot off a stove, unless it is an induction cooktop, leaves a potentially dangerous heating element or trivet that will stay hot for some time. Likewise, when taking a casserole out of a conventional oven, one's arms are exposed to the very hot walls of the oven.  A microwave oven does not pose this problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nFood and cookware taken out of a microwave oven are rarely much hotter than 100?C (212?F). Cookware used in a microwave oven is often much cooler than the food because the cookware is transparent to microwaves; the microwaves heat the food directly and the cookware is indirectly heated by the food. Food and cookware from a conventional oven, on the other hand, are the same temperature as the rest of the oven; a typical cooking temperature is 180?C (356?F).  That means that conventional stoves and ovens can cause more serious burns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lower temperature of cooking (the boiling point of water) is a significant safety benefit compared to baking in the oven or frying, because it eliminates the formation of tars and char, which are carcinogenic.[45] Microwave radiation also penetrates deeper than direct heat, so that the food is heated by its own internal water content. In contrast, direct heat can burn the surface while the inside is still cold. Pre-heating the food in a microwave oven before putting it into the grill or pan reduces the time needed to heat up the food and reduces the formation of carcinogenic char. Unlike frying and baking, microwaving does not produce acrylamide in potatoes,[46] however unlike deep-frying, it is of only limited effectiveness in reducing glycoalkaloid (i.e. solanine) levels.[47] Acrylamide has been found in other microwaved products like popcorn.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies have investigated the use of the microwave to clean non-metallic domestic sponges which have been thoroughly wetted.  A 2006 study found that microwaving wet sponges for two minutes (at 1000 watt power) removed 99% of coliforms, E. coli and MS2 phages.  Bacillus cereus spores were killed at 4 minutes of microwaving.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2017 study was less affirmative: about 60% of the germs were killed but the remaining ones quickly re-colonized the sponge.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nWater and other homogeneous liquids can superheat[50][51] when heated in a microwave oven in a container with a smooth surface. That is, the liquid reaches a temperature slightly above its normal boiling point without bubbles of vapour forming inside the liquid. The boiling process can start explosively when the liquid is disturbed, such as when the user takes hold of the container to remove it from the oven or while adding solid ingredients such as powdered creamer or sugar. This can result in spontaneous boiling (nucleation) which may be violent enough to eject the boiling liquid from the container and cause severe scalding.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nClosed containers, such as eggs, can explode when heated in a microwave oven due to the increased pressure from steam. Intact fresh egg yolks outside the shell will also explode, as a result  of superheating. Insulating plastic foams of all types generally contain closed air pockets, and are generally not recommended for use in a microwave, as the air pockets explode and the foam (which can be toxic if consumed) may melt. Not all plastics are microwave-safe, and some plastics absorb microwaves to the point that they may become dangerously hot.\\r\\n\\r\\nProducts that are heated for too long can catch fire. Though this is inherent to any form of cooking, the rapid cooking and unattended nature of the use of microwave ovens results in additional hazard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny metal or conductive object placed into the microwave will act as an antenna to some degree, resulting in an electric current. This causes the object to act as a heating element. This effect varies with the object's shape and composition, and is sometimes utilized for cooking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny object containing pointed metal can create an electric arc (sparks) when microwaved. This includes cutlery, crumpled aluminium foil (though some foil used in microwaves are safe, see below), twist-ties containing metal wire, the metal wire carry-handles in paper Chinese take-out food containers, or almost any metal formed into a poorly conductive foil or thin wire; or into a pointed shape.[53] Forks are a good example: the tines of the fork respond to the electric field by producing high concentrations of electric charge at the tips. This has the effect of exceeding the dielectric breakdown of air, about 3 megavolts per meter (3G106 V/m). The air forms a conductive plasma, which is visible as a spark. The plasma and the tines may then form a conductive loop, which may be a more effective antenna, resulting in a longer lived spark. When dielectric breakdown occurs in air, some ozone and nitrogen oxides are formed, both of which are unhealthy in large quantities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is possible for metal objects to be microwave-oven compatible, although experimentation by users is not encouraged. Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow metal pan, usually does not produce sparking. Thick metal wire racks can be part of the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the interior wall plates with perforating holes which allow light and air into the oven, and allow interior-viewing through the oven door, are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effect of microwaving thin metal films can be seen clearly on a Compact Disc or DVD (particularly the factory pressed type). The microwaves induce electric currents in the metal film, which heats up, melting the plastic in the disc and leaving a visible pattern of concentric and radial scars. Similarly, porcelain with thin metal films can also be destroyed or damaged by microwaving. Aluminium foil is thick enough to be used in microwave ovens as a shield against heating parts of food items, if the foil is not badly warped. When wrinkled, aluminium foil is generally unsafe in microwaves, as manipulation of the foil causes sharp bends and gaps that invite sparking. The USDA recommends that aluminium foil used as a partial food shield in microwave cooking cover no more than one quarter of a food object, and be carefully smoothed to eliminate sparking hazards.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother hazard is the resonance of the magnetron tube itself. If the microwave is run without an object to absorb the radiation, a standing wave will form. The energy is reflected back and forth between the tube and the cooking chamber. This may cause the tube to overload and burn out. High reflected power may also cause magnetron arcing, possibly resulting in primary power fuse failure, though such a causal relationship isn't easily established. Thus, dehydrated food, or food wrapped in metal which does not arc, is problematic for overload reasons, without necessarily being a fire hazard.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain foods such as grapes, if properly arranged, can produce an electric arc.[55] Prolonged arcing from food carries similar risks to arcing from other sources as noted above.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome other objects that may conduct sparks are plastic/holographic print thermoses (such as Starbuck's novelty cups) or cups with metal lining. If any bit of the metal is exposed, all the outer shell will burst off the object or melt.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe high electrical fields generated inside a microwave often can be illustrated by placing a radiometer or neon glow-bulb inside the cooking chamber, creating glowing plasma inside the low-pressure bulb of the device.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirect microwave exposure is not generally possible, as microwaves emitted by the source in a microwave oven are confined in the oven by the material out of which the oven is constructed. Furthermore, ovens are equipped with redundant safety interlocks, which remove power from the magnetron if the door is opened. This safety mechanism is required by United States federal regulations.[56] Tests have shown confinement of the microwaves in commercially available ovens to be so nearly universal as to make routine testing unnecessary.[57] According to the United States Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a U.S. Federal Standard limits the amount of microwaves that can leak from an oven throughout its lifetime to 5 milliwatts of microwave radiation per square centimeter at approximately 5 cm (2 in) from the surface of the oven.[58] This is far below the exposure level currently considered to be harmful to human health.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe radiation produced by a microwave oven is non-ionizing. It therefore does not have the cancer risks associated with ionizing radiation such as X-rays and high-energy particles. Long-term rodent studies to assess cancer risk have so far failed to identify any carcinogenicity from 2.45 GHz microwave radiation even with chronic exposure levels (i.e. large fraction of life span) far larger than humans are likely to encounter from any leaking ovens.[60][61] However, with the oven door open, the radiation may cause damage by heating. Every microwave oven sold has a protective interlock so that it cannot be run when the door is open or improperly latched.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrowaves generated in microwave ovens cease to exist once the electrical power is turned off. They do not remain in the food when the power is turned off, any more than light from an electric lamp remains in the walls and furnishings of a room when the lamp is turned off. They do not make the food or the oven radioactive. Compared to conventional cooking, the nutritional content of some foods may be altered differently, but generally in a positive way by preserving more micronutrients - see above. There is no indication of detrimental health issues associated with microwaved food.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are, however, a few cases where people have been exposed to direct microwave radiation, either from appliance malfunction or deliberate action.[63][64]  The general effect of this exposure will be physical burns to the body, as human tissue, particularly the outer fat and muscle layers, has similar composition to some foods that are typically cooked in microwave ovens and so experiences similar dielectric heating effects when exposed to microwave electromagnetic radiation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome magnetrons have ceramic insulators with beryllium oxide (beryllia) added. The beryllium in such oxides is a serious chemical hazard if crushed then inhaled or ingested. In addition, beryllia is listed as a confirmed human carcinogen by the IARC;[citation needed] therefore, broken ceramic insulators or magnetrons should not be handled. This is a danger if the microwave oven becomes physically damaged, if the insulator cracks, or when the magnetron is opened and handled, yet not during normal usage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of unmarked plastics for microwave cooking raises the issue of plasticizers leaching into the food[65], or the plastics chemically reacting to microwave energy, with by-products leaching into the food[66], suggesting that even plastic containers marked \\"microwavable\\" may still leach plastic by-products into the food.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plasticizers which received the most attention are bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates,[65] although it is unclear whether other plastic components present a toxicity risk.  Other issues include melting and flammability.  An alleged issue of release of dioxins into food has been dismissed[65] as an intentional red herring distraction from actual safety issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome current plastic containers and food wraps are specifically designed to resist radiation from microwaves.  Products may use the term \\"microwave safe\\",  may carry a microwave symbol (three lines of waves, one above the other) or simply provide instructions for proper microwave use. Any of these is an indication that a product is suitable for microwaving when used in accordance with the directions provided.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrowave ovens are frequently used for reheating leftover food, and bacterial contamination may not be repressed if the safe temperature is not reached, resulting in foodborne illness, as with all inadequate reheating methods. While microwaves can destroy bacteria as well as conventional ovens, they do not cook as evenly, leading to an increased risk that parts of the food will not reach recommended temperatures.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrowave ovens, although shielded for safety purposes, still emit low levels of microwave radiation. This is not harmful to humans, but can sometimes cause interference to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and other devices that communicate on the 2.45 GHz wavebands; particularly at close range.[69]","input":"When did the microwave become a common household item?"},{"output":"the sixteenth century","context":"A casta (Spanish:?[?kasta], Portuguese:?[?kast?, ?ka?t?]) was a term to describe mixed-race individuals in Spanish America, resulting from unions of European whites (espa?oles), Amerinds (indios), and Africans (negros). Racial categories had legal and social consequences, since racial status was an organizing principle of Spanish colonial rule. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, European elites created a complex hierarchical system of race classification. The sistema de castas or the sociedad de castas was used in the 17th and 18th century in Spanish America and Spanish Philippines to describe as a whole and formally socially rank the mixed-race people who were born during the post-Conquest period. The process of mixing ancestries in the union of people of different races was known as mestizaje. In Spanish colonial law, mixed-race castas were classified as part of the Rep~blica de espa?oles and not the Rep~blica de indios, which set Amerindians outside the Hispanic sphere. Other terminology for classification is categorization based on the degree of acculturation to Hispanic culture, which distinguished between gente de raz܇n (Hispanics, literally, \\"people of reason\\") and gente sin raz܇n (non-acculturated natives), concurrently existed and supported the idea of the racial classification system. Castas is a Spanish word that is used in New Mexico history to describe pueblo people and New Mexicans.\\r\\nCreated by Hispanic elites, the sistema de castas or the sociedad de castas, varied largely due to their birth, color, race and origin of ethnic types. The system of castas was more than socio-racial classification. It had an effect on every aspect of life, including economics and taxation. Both the Spanish colonial state and the Church required more tax and tribute payments from those of lower socio-racial categories.[1][2] Related to Spanish ideas about purity of blood (which historically also related to its reconquest of Spain from the Moors), the colonists established a caste system in Latin America by which a person's socio-economic status generally correlated with race or racial mix in the known family background, or simply on phenotype (physical appearance) if the family background was unknown. From the colonial period, when the Spanish imposed control, many wealthy persons and high government officials were of peninsular (Iberian) and/or European background, while African or indigenous ancestry, or dark skin, generally was correlated with inferiority and poverty. The \\"whiter\\" the heritage a person could claim, the higher in status they could climb; conversely, darker features meant less opportunity.\\r\\nCasta paintings were a new, secular art form primarily produced in eighteenth-century Mexico. A notable exception to the secular nature of the genre is Luis de Mena's 1750 painting of Virgin of Guadalupe with castas.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCasta is an Iberian word (existing in Spanish, Portuguese and other Iberian languages since the Middle Ages), meaning \\"lineage\\", \\"breed\\" or \\"race\\". It is derived from the older Latin word castus, \\"chaste\\", implying that the lineage has been kept pure. Casta gave rise to the English word caste during the Early Modern Period.[4][5]\\r\\nThe idea of \\"purity of blood\\", limpieza de sangre, originating under Moorish rule, developed in Christian Spain to denote those without the \\"taint\\" of Jewish (or, later Muslim/Moorish) heritage (\\"blood\\"). It was directly linked to religion and notions of legitimacy, lineage and honor following Spain's reconquest of Moorish territory. It was institutionalized during the Inquisition.[6] The Inquisition only allowed those Spaniards who could demonstrate not to have Jewish and Moorish blood to emigrate to Latin America. Both in Spain and in the New World crypto-Jews (converts who continued to secretly practice Judaism) were aggressively prosecuted. Some emigrated as Portuguese merchants to Mexico City and Lima, following the successful revolt of Portugal in 1640 against the Castillian Crown. Several spectacular autos de fe in New Spain in the mid-seventeenth century featured the public punishment of those convicted of being \\"Judaizers\\" (judaizantes).[7]\\r\\nIn Spanish America, the idea of purity of blood was in a complex fashion linked to ideas of race, particularly pertaining to mixing of whites (\\"espa?oles\\") and non-whites (Indians and mixed-race castas). Spaniards had become obsessed with lineage, following the expulsion of Moors and Jews, and forced conversion of those who chose to remain. Evidence of lack of purity of blood had consequences for marriage, eligibility for office, entrance into the priesthood, and emigration to Spain's overseas territories. Having to produce genealogical records to prove one's pure ancestry gave rise to a trade in the creation of false genealogies.[8]\\r\\nWhen the concept of purity of blood was transferred overseas, it retained the concerns about tainted ancestry of Jews or Muslims in a family line. During the early colonial decades, the Spanish in the New World had unions and marriages with indigenous women, resulting in generations of mixed-race children. In the late sixteenth century, some investigations of ancestry classified as \\"stains\\" any connection with Black Africans (\\"negros\\", which resulted in \\"mulatos\\") and sometimes mixtures with indigenous that produced Mestizos.[9] While some illustrations from the period show men of African descent dressed in fashionable clothing and as aristocrats in upper-class surroundings, the idea that any hint of black ancestry was a stain developed by the end of the colonial period. It was illustrated in eighteenth-century paintings of racial hierarchy, known as casta paintings.\\r\\nThe idea in New Spain that native or Indian (indio) blood in a lineage was an impurity may well have come about as the optimism of the early Franciscans faded about creating Indian priests trained at the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco, which ceased that function in the mid-sixteenth century. In addition, the Indian nobility, which was recognized by the Spanish colonists, had declined in importance, and there were fewer formal marriages between Spaniards and indigenous women than during the early decades of the colonial era.[9] In the seventeenth century in New Spain, the ideas of purity of blood became associated with \\"Spanishness and whiteness, but it came to work together with socio-economic categories\\", such that a lineage with someone engaged in work with their hands was tainted by that connection.[10]\\r\\nIndians in Central Mexico were affected by ideas of purity of blood from the other side. Crown decrees on purity of blood were affirmed by indigenous communities, which barred Indians from holding office who had any non-Indians (Spaniards and/or Blacks) in their lineage. In indigenous communities \\"local caciques [rulers] and principales were granted a set of privileges and rights on the basis of their pre-Hispanic noble bloodlines and acceptance of the Catholic faith.\\"[11] Indigenous nobles submitted proofs (probanzas) of their purity of blood to affirm their rights and privileges that were extended to themselves and their communities. This supported the rep~blica de indios, a legal division of society that separated indigenous from non-Indians (rep~blica de espa?oles).[12]\\r\\nIn the mid to late eighteenth century, the pace of race mixture (mestizaje) increased in New Spain, political changes of the Bourbon Reforms privileged peninsular Spaniards over American-born Spaniards, and casta paintings began to be produced in great numbers in Mexico. It was also the period when the power of the sistema de castas declined significantly.[13]\\r\\nIn Spanish America (and many other places), racial categories were formal legal classifications. Initially in Spanish America there were three racial categories. They generally referred to the multiplicity of indigenous American peoples as \\"Indians\\" (indios), a Spanish term applied to, but seldom used by Amerinds themselves. Those from Spain called themselves espa?oles, which in the late colonial period was further refined to those born in Iberia, called politely peninsulares, while American-born espa?oles were called criollos. The third group were black Africans, called negros (\\"Blacks\\"), brought as slaves from the earliest days of Spanish empire in the Caribbean. There were fewer Spanish women than men who immigrated to the New World and fewer black women than men, so that mixed-race offspring of Spaniards and of Blacks were often the product of liaisons with indigenous women. The process of race mixture was termed mestizaje.\\r\\nIn the sixteenth century, the term casta, a collective category for mixed-race individuals, came into existence as the numbers grew, particularly in urban areas. The crown had divided the population of its overseas empire into two categories, separating Indians from non-Indians. Indigenous were the Rep~blica de Indios, the other the Rep~blica de Espa?oles, essentially the Hispanic sphere, so that Spaniards, Blacks, and mixed-race castas were lumped into this category. Official censuses and ecclesiastical records noted an individual's racial category, so that these sources can be used to chart socio-economic standard, residence patterns, and other important data.\\r\\nGeneral racial groupings had their own set of privileges and restrictions, both legal and customary. So, for example, only Spaniards and indigenous, who were deemed to be the original societies of the Spanish dominions, had recognized aristocracies.[14][15] Also, in America and other overseas possessions, all Spaniards, regardless of their family's class background in Europe, came to consider themselves equal to the Peninsular hidalga and expected to be treated as such.\\r\\nAccess to these privileges and even a person's perceived and accepted racial classification, however, were also determined by that person's socioeconomic standing in society.[16][17][18]\\r\\nLong lists of different terms found in casta paintings do not appear in official documentation, which count Spaniards, mestizos, Blacks and mulattoes, and indigenous (indios) were found in censuses. By the end of the colonial period in 1821, over one hundred categories of possible variations of mixture existed.[19]\\r\\nIn his analysis of the 1790 census of Mexico City and its surrounding area, Dennis Nodin Valds shows that the major colonial metropolis had a higher proportion of Spaniards and castas than Indians. In addition, there were higher rates of persons of mixed race, or mestizaje, than in the surrounding countryside, which was dominated by indios. He compared the population of the capital of New Spain with the census of the Intendancy of Mexico in 1794.[20] The total number of Mexico City residents counted in 1793 was 104,760 (which excludes 8,166 officials) and in the intendancy as a whole 1,043,223, excluding 2,299 officials. In both the capital and the intendancy, the European population was the smallest percentage, with 2,335 in the capital (2.2%) and the intendancy 1,330 (.1%). The listing for Spaniard (espa?ol) was 50,371 (48.1%), with the intendancy showing 134,695 (12.9%). For mestizos (in which he has merged the castizos), in the capital there were 19,357 (18.5%) and in the intendancy 112,113 (10.7%). For the mulatto category, the capital listed 7,094 (6.8%) with the intendancy showing 52,629 (5.0%). There is apparently no separate category for blacks (Negros). The category Indian showed 25,603 (24.4%) in the capital, with the intendancy having 742,186 (71.1). The capital had the largest concentration of Spaniards and castas, and the countryside was overwhelmingly Indian. The population of the capital indicates that conditions favoring mestizaje were more favorable in the city than the outlying area\\".[21] In the 1811 census of Mexico City by residential sectors, there is no evidence of absolute segregation by race, an important finding.[22] The highest concentration of Spaniards was around the traza, the central sector of the city where the civil and religious institutions were based and where there was the highest concentration of wealthy merchants. But non-Spaniards also lived there. Indians were found in higher concentrations in the sectors on the fringes of the capital. Castas appear as residents in all sectors of the capital.\\r\\nAlthough the system could contain in excess of thirty categories, practical necessity reduced this number to seven groups ranked as follows?: Spaniards, castizos, moriscos, mestizos, mulattoes, Indians, and Africans. The terms for the more complex racial mixtures tended to vary in meaning and use and from region to region. (For example, different sets of casta paintings will give a different set of terms and interpretations of their meaning.) For the most part, only the first few terms in the lists were used in documents and everyday life, the general descending order of precedence being:\\r\\nThe main divisions were as follows:\\r\\nThese were people of Spanish descent. People of other European descent who had settled in Spanish America and adapted to Hispanic culture, such as Pedro de Gante (from Ghent) and the Marquises of Osorno and Croix, would have also been considered Espa?oles. Also, as noted above, and below under \\"Mestizos\\" and \\"Castizos\\", many people with some Amerindian ancestry were considered Espa?oles.[23]\\r\\nEspa?oles were one of the three original \\"races\\", the other two being Amerindians and Blacks. Both immigrant and American-born Espa?oles (criollos) generally shared the same rights and privileges, although there were a few cases in which the law differentiated between them.[23] For example, it became customary in some municipal councils for the office of alcalde to alternate between a European and an American. Spaniards were therefore divided into:\\r\\nPersons of Spanish descent born in Spain (i.e., from the Iberian Peninsula, hence their name). Generally, there were two groups of Peninsulares. The first group includes those who were appointed to important jobs in the government, the army, and the Catholic Church by the Crown. This system was intended to perpetuate the ties of the governing elite to the Spanish crown. The theory was that an outsider should be appointed to rule over a certain society, therefore a New Spaniard would not be appointed Viceroy of New Spain. These officials usually had a long history of service to the Crown and were moved around the Empire frequently, as in career civil service positions. They usually did not live permanently in any one place in Latin America.\\r\\nThe second group of Peninsulares did settle permanently in a specific region and came to be associated with it. The first wave were the original settlers, the Conquistadors, who became lords of an area through their act of conquest. In the centuries after the Conquest, more Peninsulares continued to immigrate to New Spain under different circumstances, usually for commercial reasons. Some came as indentured servants to established Criollo families in order to gain passage. Peninsulares were of all socioeconomic classes in America. Once they settled, they tended to form families, so Peninsulares and Criollos were united and divided by family ties and tensions.\\r\\nA Spanish term meaning \\"native born and raised\\", criollo historically was applied to both white and black non-indigenous persons born in America, in addition to animals and products. Because of the lack of white people in the Spanish colonies, during the first generations after the conquest, legitimately-born biological criollos were simply considered espa?oles criollos (see, Hyperdescent). In today's historiography, the term \\"criollo\\" means only the white people Born in America, who had unmixed Spanish or European ancestry both matrilineal and patrilineal. In the reality of the period, as noted, many criollos ended up interbreeding with the financially successful mestizos and castizos, who physically appeared white, but had some native ancestry. The knowledge of mixed ancestry was usually disregarded for families that had maintained a certain status and they were accepted as criollos.[24]\\r\\nMany of the second- or third-generation criollos became wealthy from the mines, ranches, or haciendas they owned. Criollo families who became extremely wealthy joined the ranks of the high nobility of the Spanish Empire. Still, most were part of what could be termed the petite bourgeoisie and some were poor. As lifelong residents of America, they, like all other residents of these areas, often participated in trading contraband, since the traditional monopolies of Seville, and later Cdiz, could not supply all their trade needs.[citation needed] (They were more than occasionally aided by royal officials turning a blind eye to this activity).\\r\\nCriollos tended to be appointed to the lower-level government jobs[25]they had sizable representation in the municipal councils. But, with the sale of offices that began in the late 16th century, they gained access to high-level posts, such as judges on the regional audiencias. The 19th-century wars of independence have often been characterized as a struggle between Peninsulares and Criollos, but both groups can be found on both sides of the wars.\\r\\nThe original inhabitants of the Americas were considered to be one of the three \\"pure races\\" in Spanish America; under Spanish colonial law, they were classified and regulated as minors, and as such were to be protected by royal officials. In practice, they often suffered repression and abuse by the local elites. After the initial conquest, the elites of the Inca, Aztec and other Amerindian states were assimilated into the Spanish nobility through intermarriage.[26][27]\\r\\nThe regional Native nobility, where it existed, was recognized and redefined along European standards by the Spanish. It had to deal with the difficulty of existing in a colonial society, but it remained in place until independence in 1821. Amerindians could belong to any economic class depending on their personal wealth,[26][27] but most were peasants and poor.\\r\\nPersons with one Spanish parent and one Amerindian parent. The term was originally associated with illegitimacy because in the generations after the Conquest, mixed-race children born in wedlock were assigned either a simple Amerindian or Spanish identity, depending with which culture they were raised. (See Hyperdescent and Hypodescent.) The number of official Mestizos rises in censuses only after the second half of the 17th century, when a sizable and stable community of mixed-race people with no claims on being either Amerindian or Spanish appeared.\\r\\nOne of the many terms, like the ones below, used to describe people with varying degrees of racial mixture. In this case Castizos were people with one Mestizo parent and one Spanish parent. The children of a Castizo with a Spaniard or another Castizo, were often classified and accepted as a Criollo Spaniard.[24]\\r\\nPersons with one Amerindian parent and one Mestizo parent.\\r\\nPeople who are the product of the mixing over the generations of the European, Black African, and Amerindians. This mix may come about from a white Spaniard mating with a Zambo, an Amerindian mating with a Mulatto, or a Black African mating with a Mestizo. The term is in current use in Brazil, where they form slightly less than one-half the population. Pardos in Spanish America were common in the Caribbean, such as Puerto Rico (see here), Dominican Republic, and Cuba.\\r\\nPersons of the first generation of a Spanish and Black/African ancestry. If they were born into slavery (that is their mother was a slave), they would be slaves, unless freed by their master or manumitted. In popular parlance, mulato could also denote an individual of mixed African and Native American ancestry.[29]\\r\\nFurther terms to describe other degrees of mixture included, among many others, Morisco, (not to be confused with the peninsular Morisco, from which the term was borrowed) a person of Mulatto and Spanish parents, i.e., a quadroon, and Albino (derived from albino), a person of Morisco and Spanish parents, i.e., an octoroon.\\r\\nPersons who were of mixed Amerindian and Black ancestry. As with Mulattoes, many other terms existed to describe the degree of mixture. These included Chino and Lobo. Chino usually described someone as having Mulatto and Amerindian parents. The word chino derives from the Spanish word cochino, meaning \\"pig\\",[30] and the phrase pelo chino, meaning \\"curly hair\\", is a reference to the casta known as chino that possessed kinky or curly hair.[30]\\r\\nSince there was some immigration from the Spanish East Indies during the colonial period, chino is often confused, even by contemporary historians, as a word for Asian peoples, which is the primary meaning of the word, but not usually in the context of the castas. Lobo could describe a person of Black and Amerindian parents (and therefore, a synonym for Zambo), as in the image gallery below, or someone of Amerindian and Torna atrs parents.\\r\\nWith Spaniards and Amerindians, this was the third original race in this paradigm, but low on the social scale because of their association with slavery. These were people of full Sub-Saharan African descent. Many, especially among the first generation, were slaves, but there were sizable free-Black communities. Distinction was made between Blacks born in Africa (negros bozales) and therefore possibly less acculturated, Blacks born in the Iberian Peninsula (Black Ladinos), and Blacks born in the Indies, these sometimes referred to as negros criollos.\\r\\nTheir low social status was enforced legally. They were prohibited by law from many positions, such as entering the priesthood, and their testimony in court was valued less than others. But they could join militias created especially for them. In contrast with the binary \\"one-drop rule\\", which evolved in the late-19th-century United States, people of mixed-Black ancestry were recognized as multiple separate groups, as noted above.\\r\\nOther fanciful or derogatory terms existed, such as a torna atrs (literally, \\"turns back\\", but equivalent to the English term \\"throwback\\") and tente en el aire (\\"hold-yourself-in-midair\\") in New Spain or a requinter܇n in Peru,[31] which implied that a child of only one-sixteenth Black ancestry is born looking Black to seemingly white parents. These terms were rarely used in legal documents and existed mostly in the New Spanish phenomenon of casta paintings (pinturas de castas), which showed possible mixtures down to several generations.[32]\\r\\nThe interest of the Spanish Enlightenment in organizing knowledge and scientific description, resulted in the commission of many series of pictures that document the racial combinations that existed in the exotic lands that Spain possessed on the other side of the world. Many sets of these paintings still exist (around one hundred complete sets in museums and private collections and many more individual paintings), of varying artistic quality, usually consisting of sixteen paintings representing as many racial combinations. Some of the finer sets were done by prominent Mexican artists, such as Miguel Cabrera, Jos Joaqun Mag܇n (who painted two sets), Jos de Ibarra, and Juan Patricio Morlete Ruiz. These artists worked together in the painting guilds of New Spain. They were important transitional artists in 18th-century casta painting. At least one Spaniard, Francisco Clapera, also contributed to the casta genre. In general, little is known of most artists who did sign their work; most casta paintings are unsigned.\\r\\nThe overall themes that emerge in these paintings are the \\"supremacy of the Spaniards\\", the possibility that Indians could become Spaniards through miscegenation with Spaniards and the \\"regression to an earlier moment of racial development\\" that mixing with Blacks would cause to Spaniards. These series generally depict the descendants of Indians becoming Spanish after three generations of intermarriage with Spaniards (usually the, \\"De espa?ol y castiza, espa?ol\\" painting).[33]\\r\\nIn contrast, mixtures with Blacks, both by Indians and Spaniards, led to a bewildering number of combinations, with \\"fanciful terms\\" to describe them. Instead of leading to a new racial type or equilibrium, they led to apparent disorder. Terms such as the above-mentioned tente en el aire and no te entiendo (\\"I don't understand you\\")and others based on terms used for animals: mulato (mule) and lobo (wolf), chino (derived from cochino meaning \\"pig\\")[30]reflect the fear and mistrust that Spanish officials, society and those who commissioned these paintings saw these new racial types.[33]\\r\\nAt the same time, it must be emphasized that these paintings reflected the views of the economically established Criollo society and officialdom. Castas defined themselves in different ways, and how they were recorded in official records was a process of negotiation between the casta and the person creating the document, whether it was a birth certificate, a marriage certificate or a court deposition. In real life, many casta individuals were assigned different racial categories in different documents, revealing the fluid nature of racial identity in colonial, Spanish American society.[34]\\r\\nIn New Spain, one of the Viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire, casta paintings illustrated where each person in the New World ranked in the system. These paintings from 18th and 19th centuries were popular in Spain and other parts of Europe. They reflected the Spaniards sense of racial superiority by illustrating an orderly hierarchical society where socio-economic status depended on skin color and limpieza de sangre (purity of blood).[2][35]\\r\\nSome paintings depicted the innate character and quality of people because of their birth and ethnic origin. For example, according to one painting by Jos Joaqun Mag܇n, a mestizo (mixed Indian + Spanish) was considered generally humble, tranquil, and straightforward; while another painting claims from Lobo and Indian woman is born the Cambujo, one usually slow, lazy, and cumbersome. Ultimately, the casta paintings are reminders of the colonial biases in modern human history that linked a caste/ethnic society based on descent, skin color, social status, and one's birth.[2][35]\\r\\nOften, casta paintings depicted commodity items from Latin America like pulque, the fermented alcohol drink of the lower classes. Painters depicted interpretations of pulque that were attributed to specific castas. Pulque abuse was shown in some casta paintings as a social criticism of the lower castas, and the Spanish desire for regulation over pulque consumption and distribution.\\r\\nPresented here are casta lists from three sets of paintings. Note that they only agree on the first five combinations, which are essentially the Indian-White ones. There is no agreement on the Black mixtures, however. Also, no one list should be taken as \\"authoritative\\". These terms would have varied from region to region and across time periods. The lists here probably reflect the names that the artist knew or preferred, the ones the patron requested to be painted, or a combination of both.\\r\\nCanbujo con Yndia sale Albaracado / Notentiendo con Yndia sale China, ܇leo sobre lienzo, 222 x 109?cm, Madrid, Museo de Amrica\\r\\nMiguel Cabrera \\"From Spaniard and Mulatta: Morisca\\"\\r\\n\\"from Mulatto and Mestiza, produce Mulatto, he is Torna Atrs\\" by Juan Rodrguez Jurez\\r\\nJos Joaqun Mag܇n, The Mulatta - from the series The Mexican Castes\\r\\nDe espa?ol e india, produce mestizo (From a Spanish man and an Amerindian woman, a Mestizo is produced).\\r\\nDe negro y espa?ola, sale mulato (From a Black man and a Spanish woman, a Mulatto is begotten).\\r\\nDe mestizo e india, sale coiote (From a Mestizo man and an Amerindian woman, a Coyote is begotten).\\r\\nDe negro e india, sale lobo (From a Black man and an Amerindian woman, a Lobo is begotten).\\r\\nMestizo, Mestiza, Mestizo Sample of a Peruvian casta painting, showing intermarriage within a casta category.\\r\\nThe discussion of Limpieza de sangre makes it appear as if differentiation based upon privileges applied only to the distinction between Christians and Jews and Muslims; this was later extended to distinguish clearly between Catholics and Protestants.

Under this model, a state's government is divided into branches, each with separate and independent powers and areas of responsibility so that the powers of one branch are not in conflict with the powers associated with the other branches. The typical division is into three branches: a legislature, an executive, and a judiciary, which is the trias politica model. It can be contrasted with the fusion of powers in some parliamentary systems where the executive and legislature are unified.\\r\\nSeparation of powers, therefore, refers to the division of responsibilities into distinct branches to limit any one branch from exercising the core functions of another.

Calvin appreciated the advantages of democracy, stating: \\"It is an invaluable gift if God allows a people to elect its own government and magistrates.\\"[1] In order to reduce the danger of misuse of political power, Calvin suggested setting up several political institutions which should complement and control each other in a system of checks and balances.[2]\\r\\nIn this way, Calvin and his followers resisted political absolutism and furthered the growth of democracy. Calvin aimed to protect the rights and the well-being of ordinary people.[3][need quotation to verify] In 1620, a group of English separatist Congregationalists and Anglicans (later known as the Pilgrim Fathers) founded Plymouth Colony in North America. Enjoying self-rule, they established a bipartite democratic system of government. The \\"freemen\\" elected the General Court, which functioned as legislature and judiciary and which in turn elected a governor, who together with his seven \\"assistants\\" served in the functional role of providing executive power.[4] Massachusetts Bay Colony (founded 1628), Rhode Island (1636), Connecticut (1636), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania had similar constitutions ÿ they all separated political powers. (Except for Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony, these English outposts added religious freedom to their democratic systems, an important step towards the development of human rights.[5][6]) Books like William Bradford's History of Plymoth Plantation (written between 1630 and 1651) were widely read in England.[citation needed] So the form of government in the colonies was well known in the mother country, including to the philosopher John Locke (1632ÿ1704). He deduced from a study of the English constitutional system the advantages of dividing political power into the legislative (which should be distributed among several bodies, for example, the House of Lords and the House of Commons), on the one hand, and the executive and federative power, responsible for the protection of the country and prerogative of the monarch, on the other hand. (The Kingdom of England had no written constitution.)[7][need quotation to verify]\\r\\nThe term tripartite system is commonly ascribed to French Enlightenment political philosopher Baron de Montesquieu, although he did not use such a term. In reality he referred to \\"distribution\\" of powers. In The Spirit of the Laws (1748), Montesquieu described the various forms of distribution of political power among a legislature, an executive, and a judiciary. Montesquieu's approach was to present and defend a form of government which was not excessively centralized in all its powers to a single monarch or similar ruler, form of government known then as \\"aristocracy\\". He based this model on the Constitution of the Roman Republic and the British constitutional system. Montesquieu took the view that the Roman Republic had powers separated so that no one could usurp complete power.[8][9][10] In the British constitutional system, Montesquieu discerned a separation of powers among the monarch, Parliament, and the courts of law.\\r\\nMontesquieu did actually specify that the independence of the judiciary has to be real, and not apparent merely.[11] The judiciary was generally seen as the most important of the three powers, independent and unchecked,[12] while also likely to claim to be the least dangerous one.[11]\\r\\nTo prevent one branch from becoming supreme, protect the \\"opulent minority\\" from the majority, and to induce the branches to cooperate, government systems that employ a separation of powers need a way to balance each of the branches. Typically this was accomplished through a system of \\"checks and balances\\", the origin of which, like separation of powers itself, is specifically credited to Montesquieu. Checks and balances allow for a system-based regulation that allows one branch to limit another, such as the power of the United States Congress to alter the composition and jurisdiction of the federal courts. Both bipartite and tripartite governmental systems apply the principles of the separation of powers to allow for the branches represented by the separate powers to hold each other reciprocally responsible to the assertion of powers as apportioned by law. The following example of the separation of powers and their mutual checks and balances for the experience of the United States Constitution is presented as illustrative of the general principles applied in similar forms of government as well.\\r\\nConstitutions with a high degree of separation of powers are found worldwide. The UK system is distinguished by a particular entwining of powers.[14] A number of Latin American countries have electoral branches of government.\\r\\nCountries with little separation of power include New Zealand and Canada. Canada makes limited use of separation of powers in practice, although in theory it distinguishes between branches of government.\\r\\nNew Zealand's constitution is based on the principle of separation of powers through a series of constitutional safeguards, many of which are tacit. The Executive's ability to carry out decisions often depends on the Legislature, which is elected under the mixed member proportional system. This means the government is rarely a single party but a coalition of parties. The Judiciary is also free of government interference. If a series of judicial decisions result in an interpretation of the law which the Executive considers does not reflect the intention of the policy, the Executive can initiate changes to the legislation in question through the Legislature. The Executive cannot direct or request a judicial officer to revise or reconsider a decision; decisions are final. Should there be a dispute between the Executive and Judiciary, the Executive has no authority to direct the Judiciary, or its individual members and vice versa.\\r\\nComplete separation of powers systems are almost always presidential, although theoretically this need not be the case. There are a few historical exceptions, such as the Directoire system of revolutionary France. Switzerland offers an example of non-Presidential separation of powers today: It is run by a seven-member executive branch, the Federal Council. However, some might argue[weasel?words] that Switzerland does not have a strong separation of powers system, as the Federal Council is appointed by parliament (but not dependent on parliament) and although the judiciary has no power of review, the judiciary is still separate from the other branches.\\r\\nAustralia does not maintain a strict separation between the legislative and executive branches of governmentindeed, government ministers are required to be members of parliamentbut the federal judiciary strictly guards its independence from the other two branches. However, under influence from the American constitution, the Australian constitution does define the three branches of government separately, and this has been interpreted by the judiciary to induce an implicit separation of powers.[15] State governments have a similar level of separation of power, but this is generally on the basis of convention, rather than constitution.\\r\\nThe Constitution of Austria was originally written by Hans Kelsen, the prominent constitutional scholar in Europe at that time. Kelsen was to serve as a part of the judicial court of review for Austria as part of its tripartite government.\\r\\nThe Constitution of the Czech Republic, adopted in 1992 immediately before the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, establishes the traditional tripartite division of powers[16] and continues the tradition of its predecessor constitutions. The Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920, which replaced the provisional constitution adopted by the newly independent state in 1918, was modeled after the constitutions of established democracies such as those of the United Kingdom, United States and France, and maintained this division,[17] as have subsequent changes to the constitution that followed in 1948 with the Ninth-of-May Constitution, the 1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia as well as the Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation of 1968.\\r\\nAccording to the Constitution of the Fifth Republic, the government of France[18] is divided up into three branches:\\r\\nHong Kong is a Special Administrative Region established in 1997 pursuant to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, an international treaty made between Britain and China in 1984, registered with the United Nations. Currently, Hong Kong has three branches of government as codified in the Basic Law, its constitution, which largely preserved political structures of the British colonial era, under the doctrine of one country, two systems:\\r\\nThe Chief Executive, elected by a 1200-member Election Committee which historically was dominated by pro-Beijing establishment members, is both head of the region and head of government, and chairs the Executive Council which is composed of \\"unofficial\\" members and government secretaries.\\r\\nThe legislature consists of 70 members, 35 of whom are elected by \\"functional\\" constituencies represented by members within various industries rather than the public at large.[20] Separation of power between executive and legislature is, therefore, questionable.[21][citation needed]\\r\\nThe courts frequently exercise a power of judicial review of administrative actions and also decide matters of constitutionality of legislation, though this power is circumscribed under the power of the People's Republic of China's National People's Congress to make final determinations as to interpretation.[22] Hence, the separation of powers is again structurally weak.\\r\\nIt is worth noting that the branches' separation of power may not be intended within the Hong Kong Basic Law as leaders of the PRC have publicly called for the three branches to cooperate and be led by the Chief Executive.[23]\\r\\nFurther, Deng Xiaoping was quoted to have categorically dismissed Hong Kong having a \\"Trias Politica\\" system.[24]\\r\\nIndia follows constitutional democracy which offers a clear separation of powers. The judiciary branch is fairly independent of the other two branches with the power to interpret the constitution. Parliament has the legislative powers. Executive powers are vested with the President who is advised by the Union Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister. The constitution of India vested the duty of protecting, preserving and defending the constitution with the President as common head of the executive, parliament, armed forces, etc. not only for the union government but also the various state governments in a federal structure. All three branches have \\"checks and balances\\" over each other to maintain the balance of power and not to exceed the constitutional limits.[25]\\r\\nIn Italy the powers are separated, even though the Council of Ministers needs a vote of confidence from both chambers of Parliament, that represents a large number of members (almost 1,000).[26]\\r\\nLike every parliamentary form of government, there is no real separation between Legislature and Executive, rather a continuum between them due to the confidence link. By the way, the balance is protected by Constitution also between these two branches.[27] and, obviously, between them and the judiciary branch, which is really independent.\\r\\nA note on the status of separation of power, checks and balances, and balance of power in Norway today.[28]\\r\\nIn the original constitution of 1814 the Montesquieu concept was enshrined, and the people at the time had the same skepticism about political parties as the American founding fathers and the revolutionaries in France. Nor did people really want to get rid of the king and the Council of State (privy council). King and council was a known concept that people had lived with for a long time and was for the most part comfortable with. The 1814 constitution came about as a reaction to external events, most notable the Treaty of Kiel see 1814 in Norway. There was no revolution against the current powers that had been be the case in the US and France.\\r\\nAs there was no election of the executive, the king reigned supremely independent in selecting the members of the Council of State, no formal political parties formed util the 1880s. A conflict between the executive and legislature started developing in the 1870s and climaxed with the legislature impeaching the entire Council of State in 1884. (See Statsr?dssaken (Norwegian wikipedia page))\\r\\nWith this came a switch to a?parliamentary system of government and while the full process takes decades, it has led to a system of parliamentary sovereignty where the Montesquieu idea of separation of powers is technically dead even though the three branches remain important institutions.\\r\\nThis does not mean that there are no checks and balances. With the introduction of a parliamentary system, political parties started to form quickly and this led to a call for electoral reform that saw the introduction of a Party-list proportional representation in 1918. The peculiarities of the Norwegian election system generate 6ÿ8 parties and make it extremely difficult for a single party to gain an absolute majority. It has only occurred for a brief period in the aftermath of World War II where the Labour Party had an absolute majority.\\r\\nA multi-party system parliament that must either form a minority executive or a coalition executive function as a perfectly good system of checks and balances even if it was never a stated goal for the introduction of multiparty system. The multiparty system came about in response to a public outcry of having too few parties and a general feeling of a lack of representation. For this reason you'll find very little on the topic of separation of powers or checks and balances in the works of Norwegian political sciences today.\\r\\nThe development of the British constitution, which is not a codified document, is based on this fusion in the person of the Monarch, who has a formal role to play in the legislature (Parliament, which is where legal and political sovereignty lies, is the Crown-in-Parliament, and is summoned and dissolved by the Sovereign who must give his or her Royal Assent to all Bills so that they become Acts), the executive (the Sovereign appoints all ministers of His/Her Majesty's Government, who govern in the name of the Crown) and the judiciary (the Sovereign, as the fount of justice, appoints all senior judges, and all public prosecutions are brought in his or her name).\\r\\nAlthough the doctrine of separation of power plays a role in the United Kingdom's constitutional doctrine, the UK constitution is often described as having \\"a weak separation of powers\\" A. V. Dicey, despite its constitution being the one to which Montesquieu originally referred. For example, in the United Kingdom, the executive forms a subset of the legislature, as didto a lesser extentthe judiciary until the establishment of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister, the Chief Executive, sits as a member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, either as a peer in the House of Lords or as an elected member of the House of Commons (by convention, and as a result of the supremacy of the Lower House, the Prime Minister now sits in the House of Commons) and can effectively be removed from office by a simple majority vote. Furthermore, while the courts in the United Kingdom are amongst the most independent in the world,[citation needed] the Law Lords, who were the final arbiters of judicial disputes in the UK sat simultaneously in the House of Lords, the upper house of the legislature, although this arrangement ceased in 2009 when the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom came into existence. Furthermore, because of the existence of Parliamentary sovereignty, while the theory of separation of powers may be studied there, a system such as that of the UK is more accurately described as a \\"fusion of powers\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nUntil 2005, the Lord Chancellor fused the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary, as he was the ex officio Speaker of the House of Lords, a Government Minister who sat in Cabinet and was head of the Lord Chancellor's Department which administered the courts, the justice system and appointed judges, and was the head of the Judiciary in England and Wales and sat as a judge on the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords, the highest domestic court in the entire United Kingdom, and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the senior tribunal court for parts of the Commonwealth. The Lord Chancellor also had certain other judicial positions, including being a judge in the Court of Appeal and President of the Chancery Division. The Lord Chancellor combines other aspects of the constitution, including having certain ecclesiastical functions of the established state church, making certain church appointments, nominations and sitting as one of the thirty-three Church Commissioners. These functions remain intact and unaffected by the Constitutional Reform Act. In 2005, the Constitutional Reform Act separated the powers with Legislative functions going to an elected Lord Speaker and the Judicial functions going to the Lord Chief Justice. The Lord Chancellor's Department was replaced with a Ministry of Justice and the Lord Chancellor currently serves in the position of Secretary of State for Justice.\\r\\nThe judiciary has no power to strike down primary legislation, and can only rule on secondary legislation that it is invalid with regard to the primary legislation if necessary.\\r\\nUnder the concept of parliamentary sovereignty, Parliament can enact any primary legislation it chooses. However, the concept immediately becomes problematic when the question is asked; \\"If parliament can do anything, can it bind its successors?\\". It is generally held that parliament can do no such thing.\\r\\nEqually, while statute takes precedence over precedent-derived common law and the judiciary has no power to strike down primary legislation, there are certain cases where the supreme judicature has effected an injunction against the application of an act or reliance on its authority by the civil service. The seminal example of this is the Factortame case, where the House of Lords granted such an injunction preventing the operation of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 until litigation in the European Court of Justice had been resolved.\\r\\nThe House of Lords ruling in Factortame (No. 1), approving the European Court of Justice formulation that \\"a national court which, in a case before it concerning Community law, considers that the sole obstacle which precludes it from granting interim relief is a rule of national law, must disapply that rule\\", has created an implicit tiering of legislative reviewability; the only way for parliament to prevent the supreme judicature from injunctively striking out a law on the basis of incompatibility with Community law is to pass an act specifically removing that power from the court, or by repealing the European Communities Act 1972.\\r\\nThe British legal systems are based on common law traditions, which require:\\r\\nIn the United States Constitution, Article 1 Section I gives Congress only those \\"legislative powers herein granted\\" and proceeds to list those permissible actions in Article I Section 8, while Section 9 lists actions that are prohibited for Congress. The vesting clause in Article II places no limits on the Executive branch, simply stating that, \\"The Executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.\\"[29] The Supreme Court holds \\"The judicial Power\\" according to Article III, and it established the implication of Judicial review in Marbury v. Madison under the Marshall court.[30]\\r\\nThe federal government refers to the branches as \\"branches of government\\", while some systems use \\"government\\" to describe the executive. The Executive branch has attempted[31] to claim power arguing for separation of powers to include being the Commander in Chief of a standing army since the American Civil War, executive orders, emergency powers and security classifications since World War II, national security, signing statements, and the scope of the unitary executive.\\r\\nAccording to Sun Yat-sen's idea of \\"separation of the five powers\\", the government of the Republic of China has five branches:\\r\\nThe president and vice president as well as the defunct National Assembly are constitutionally not part of the above five branches. Before being abolished in 2005, the National Assembly was a standing constituent assembly and electoral college for the president and vice president. Its constitutional amending powers were passed to the legislative yuan and its electoral powers were passed to the electorate.\\r\\nThe relationship between the executive and legislative branches are poorly defined. An example of the problems this causes is the near complete political paralysis that results when the president, who has neither the power to veto nor the ability to dissolve the legislature and call new elections, cannot negotiate with the legislature when his party is in the minority.[32] The examination and control yuans are marginal branches; their leaders as well as the leaders of the executive and judicial yuans are appointed by the president and confirmed by the legislative yuan. The legislature is the only branch that chooses its own leadership. The vice president has practically no responsibilities.\\r\\nBelgium is currently a federated state that has imposed the trias politica on different governmental levels. The constitution of 1831, considered one of the most liberal of its time for limiting the powers of its monarch and imposing a rigorous system of separation of powers, is based on three principles (represented in the Schematic overview of Belgian institutions):\\r\\nTrias Politica (horizontal separation of powers):\\r\\nSubsidiarity (vertical separation of powers):\\r\\nSecularism (separation of state and religion):\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the 43-day civil war in 1948 (after former President and incumbent candidate Rafael lgel Calder܇n Guardia tried to take power through fraud, by not recognising the results of the presidential election that he had lost), the question of which transformational model the Costa Rican State would follow was the main issue that confronted the victors. A Constituent Assembly was elected by popular vote to draw up a new constitution, enacted in 1949, and remains in force. This document was an edit of the constitution of 1871, as the constituent assembly rejected more radical corporatist ideas proposed by the ruling Junta Fundadora de la Segunda Rep~blica (which, although having come to power by military force, abolished the armed forces). Nonetheless, the new constitution increased centralization of power at the expense of municipalities and eliminated provincial government altogether, at the time it increased the powers of congress and the judiciary.\\r\\nIt established the three supreme powers as the legislature, executive, and judicial branches, but also created two other autonomous state organs that have equivalent power, but not equivalent rank. The first is the Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones de Costa Rica (electoral branch) which controls elections and makes unique, unappealable decisions on their outcomes.\\r\\nThe second is the office of the Comptroller General (audit branch), an autonomous and independent organ nominally subordinate to the unicameral legislative assembly. All budgets of ministries and municipalities must pass through this agency, including the execution of budget items such as contracting for routine operations. The Comptroller also provides financial vigilance over government offices and office holders, and routinely brings actions to remove mayors for malfeasance, firmly establishing this organization as the fifth branch of the Republic.\\r\\nThe European Union is a supranational polity, and is neither a country nor a federation; but as the EU wields political power it complies with the principle of separation of powers. There are seven institutions of the European Union. In intergovernmental matters, most power is concentrated in the Council of the European Uniongiving it the characteristics of a normal international organization. Here, all power at the EU level is in one branch. In the latter there are four main actors. The European Commission acts as an independent executive which is appointed by the Council in conjunction with the European Parliament; but the Commission also has a legislative role as the sole initiator of EU legislation.[33][34] [35] An early maxim was: \\"The Commission proposes and the Council disposes\\"; and although the EU's lawmaking procedure is now much more complicated, this simple maxim still holds some truth. As well as both executive and legislative functions, the Commission arguably exercises a third, quasi-judicial, function under Articles 101 & 102 TFEU (competition law ); although the ECJ remains the final arbiter. The European Parliament is one half of the legislative branch and is directly elected. The Council itself acts both as the second half of the legislative branch and also holds some executive functions (some of which are exercised by the related European Council in practice). The European Court of Justice acts as the independent judicial branch, interpreting EU law and treaties. The remaining institution, the European Court of Auditors, is an independent audit authority (due to the sensitive nature of fraud in the EU).\\r\\nThe three branches in German government are further divided into six main bodies enshrined in the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany:\\r\\nBesides the constitutional court the judicial branch at the federal level is made up of five supreme courtsone for civil and criminal cases (Bundesgerichtshof), and one each for administrative, tax, labour, and social security issues. There are also state (L?nder / Bundesl?nder) based courts beneath them, and a rarely used senate of the supreme courts.\\r\\nThe four independent branches of power in Hungary (the parliament, the government, the court system, and the office of the public accuser) are divided into six bodies:\\r\\nThe independent pillar status of the Hungarian public accuser's office is a unique construction, loosely modeled on the system Portugal introduced after the 1974 victory of the Carnation Revolution. The public accuser (attorney general) body has become the fourth column of Hungarian democracy only in recent times: after communism fell in 1989, the office was made independent by a new clausule XI. of the Constitution. The change was meant to prevent abuse of state power, especially with regards to the use of false accusations against opposition politicians, who may be excluded from elections if locked in protracted or excessively severe court cases.\\r\\nTo prevent the Hungarian accuser's office from neglecting its duties, natural human private persons can submit investigation requests, called \\"p܇tmagnvd\\" directly to the courts, if the accusers' office refuses to do its job. Courts will decide if the allegations have merit and order police to act in lieu of the accuser's office if warranted. In its decision No. 42/2005 the Hungarian constitutional court declared that the government does not enjoy such privilege and the state is powerless to further pursue cases if the public accuser refuses to do so.","input":"Who developed the idea of separation of powers?"},{"output":"August 31, 2010","context":"The My World Tour was the debut concert tour by Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber.

The founders, clergy exiled under Mary I, returned to England shortly after the accession of Elizabeth I of England in 1558.\\r\\nPuritanism played a significant role in English history during the first half of the 17th century. One of the most effective stokers of anti-Catholic feeling was John Pym, whose movement succeeded in taking control of the government of London at the time of the Grand Remonstrance of 1641.\\r\\nPuritans were blocked from changing the established church from within and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion. Their beliefs, however, were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands, and later to New England in North America, and by evangelical clergy to Ireland (and later to Wales), and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system, particularly certain colleges of the University of Cambridge. They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the episcopal system, particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the Synod of Dort were resisted by the English bishops. They largely adopted Sabbatarianism in the 17th century, and were influenced by millennialism.\\r\\nThe Puritans were in alliance with the growing commercial world, with the parliamentary opposition to the royal prerogative, and with the Scottish Presbyterians in the late 1630s with whom they had much in common. Consequently, they became a major political force in England and came to power as a result of the First English Civil War (1642ÿ46). Almost all Puritan clergy left the Church of England after the Restoration of 1660 and the 1662 Uniformity Act, with many continuing to practice their faith in nonconformist denominations, especially in Congregationalist, as well as in Presbyterian churches.[2] The nature of the movement in England changed radically, although it retained its character for a much longer period in New England.\\r\\nPuritans by definition were dissatisfied with the limited extent of the English Reformation and with the Church of England's tolerance of practices which they associated with the Catholic Church. They formed and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of worship and doctrine, as well as personal and group piety. Puritans adopted a Reformed theology and, in that sense, were Calvinists (as were many of their earlier opponents), but they also took note of radical criticisms of Zwingli in Zurich and Calvin in Geneva. In church polity, some advocated separation from all other established Christian denominations in favour of autonomous gathered churches. These separatist and independent strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s, when the supporters of a Presbyterian polity in the Westminster Assembly were unable to forge a new English national church.\\r\\nThe Puritans were never a formally defined sect or religious division within Protestantism, and the term \\"Puritan\\" itself was rarely used to describe people after the turn of the 18th century. Some Puritan ideals became incorporated into the Church of England, such as the formal rejection of Roman Catholicism; some were absorbed into the many Protestant denominations that emerged in the late 17th and early 18th centuries in the Americas and Britain. The Congregationalist Churches, widely considered to be a part of the Reformed tradition, are descended from the Puritans.[3][4] Moreover, Puritan beliefs are enshrined in the Savoy Declaration, the confession of faith held by the Congregationalist Churches, which they originated.[5]\\r\\nHistorically, the word \\"Puritan\\" was considered a pejorative term that characterized Protestant groups as extremists, similar to the Cathars of France. According to Thomas Fuller in his Church History, the term dates to 1564. Archbishop Matthew Parker of that time used it and \\"precisian\\" with the sense of the modern \\"stickler\\".[6] In modern times, the word \\"puritan\\" is often used to mean \\"against pleasure\\".[7]\\r\\nThe \\"Puritan\\" movement referred to the desire and goal of purifying the Church of England and Roman Catholic Church from within, in contrast to \\"Separatists\\" such as the Pilgrims, who believed that the established churches could not be reformed and the only hope was to set up separate churches. In this sense, the term \\"Puritan\\" was coined in the 1560s, when it first appeared as a term of abuse for those who found the Elizabethan Religious Settlement of 1559 inadequate. The term Puritan, therefore, was not intended to refer to strict morality, a common modern misunderstanding, but to a reforming attitude towards established churches.\\r\\nThe word \\"Puritan\\" was applied unevenly to a number of Protestant churches (and religious groups within the Anglican Church) from the late 16th century onwards. Puritans did not originally use the term for themselves. The practitioners knew themselves as members of particular churches or movements, and not by a single term. \\"Precise men\\" and \\"Precisians\\" were other early derogatory terms for Puritans, who preferred to call themselves \\"the godly\\" and the \\"saints\\". Seventeenth century English Puritan preacher Thomas Watson used \\"the godly\\" to describe Puritans in the title of one of his more famous works The Godly Man's Picture. The parliament that came into being on 4 July 1653, after a request by Oliver Cromwell and the Army Council of Offices was known by its supporters as the Parliament of Saints and the Barebones Parliament by its Royalist detractors.\\r\\nSome Puritans are known as \\"non-separating Puritans,\\" those who were not satisfied with the Reformation of the Church of England but who remained within it, advocating further reforms. This group disagreed among themselves about how much further reformation was possible or even necessary. Others thought that the Church of England was so corrupt that true Christians should separate from it altogether; they are known as \\"separating Puritans\\" or simply \\"Separatists\\". The term \\"Puritan\\" in the wider sense includes both groups.[8][9] Separatists had no particular Church title.\\r\\nThe Mayflower Pilgrims[10] were referred to only as Separatists.[11] Plymouth Colony leaders John Robinson and William Brewster were separatists.[12][13] In contrast, John Winthrop and the other main leaders of Puritan emigration to New England in 1629 were non-separating Puritans.[14] There is no current consensus among modern historians whether Separatists can properly be counted as Puritans,[15] but separatists and non-separatists alike have traditionally been viewed as two branches of the Puritan view.\\r\\nSeparating Puritans were called \\"Dissenters,\\" especially after the English Restoration of 1660. The 1662 Uniformity Act caused almost all Puritan clergy to leave the Church of England, the so-called Great Ejection or Black Bartholomew's Day (see below). They were removed in part because they objected to a Church ruled by bishops and the requirement that all ministers of the Church of England (deacons, priests and bishops) be ordained by bishops in the Apostolic Succession. Some of these 2,000 \\"ejected\\" clergymen became nonconformist ministers (later Congregationalists, Baptists, Unitarians, Presbyterians, etc.). The movement in England changed radically at this time, though this change was not as immediate across the Atlantic (see History of the Puritans in North America).\\r\\nIn modern usage, the word \\"puritan\\" is often used to describe someone who adheres to strict, joyless moral or religious principles. In this usage, hedonism and puritanism are antonyms.[7] In fact, Puritans embraced sexuality but placed it in the context of marriage. Peter Gay writes of the Puritans' standard reputation for \\"dour prudery\\" as a \\"misreading that went unquestioned in the nineteenth century\\", commenting how unpuritanical they were in favour of married sexuality, and in opposition to the Catholic veneration of virginity, citing Edward Taylor and John Cotton.[16] One Puritan settlement in Western Massachusetts banished a husband and sent him into exile because he refused to fulfill his marital duties to his wife.[17]\\r\\nPuritanism has a historical importance over a period of a century, followed by 50 years of development in New England. It changed character and emphasis almost decade-by-decade over that time.\\r\\nElizabethan Puritanism contended with the Elizabethan religious settlement, with little to show for it. The Lambeth Articles of 1595, a high-water mark for Calvinism within the Church of England, failed to receive royal approval.\\r\\nThe accession of James I brought the Millenary Petition, a Puritan manifesto of 1603 for reform of the English church, but James wanted a new religious settlement along different lines. He called the Hampton Court Conference in 1604, and heard the teachings of four prominent Puritan leaders there, including Laurence Chaderton, but largely sided with his bishops. He was well informed on theological matters by his education and Scottish upbringing, and he dealt shortly with the peevish legacy of Elizabethan Puritanism, pursuing an eirenic religious policy, in which he was arbiter.\\r\\nMany of his episcopal appointments were Calvinists, notably James Montague, who was an influential courtier. Puritans still opposed much of the Catholic summation in the Church of England, notably the Book of Common Prayer, but also the use of non-secular vestments (cap and gown) during services, the sign of the Cross in baptism, and kneeling to receive Holy Communion.[18] Some of the bishops under both Elizabeth and James tried to suppress the Puritan Movement, though other bishops were more tolerant and, in many places, individual ministers were able to omit disliked portions of the Book of Common Prayer.\\r\\nThe Puritan movement of Jacobean times became distinctive by adaptation and compromise, with the emergence of \\"semi-separatism,\\" \\"moderate puritanism,\\" the writings of William Bradshaw, who adopted the term \\"Puritan\\" as self-identification, and the beginnings of congregationalism.[19] Most Puritans of this period were non-separating and remained within the Church of England, and Separatists who left the Church of England altogether were numerically much fewer.\\r\\nThe Puritan movement in England was riven over decades by emigration and inconsistent interpretations of Scripture, as well as some political differences that surfaced at that time. The Fifth Monarchy Men, a radical millenarian wing of Puritanism, aided by strident, popular clergy like Vavasor Powell, agitated from the right wing of the movement, even as sectarian groups like the Ranters, Levelers, and Quakers pulled from the left.[20][21] The fragmentation created a collapse of the centre and, ultimately, sealed a political failure, while depositing an enduring spiritual legacy that would remain and grow in English-speaking Christianity.[22]\\r\\nThe Westminster Assembly was called in 1643, assembling clergy of the Church of England. The Assembly was able to agree to the Westminster Confession of Faith doctrinally, a consistent Reformed theological position. The Directory of Public Worship was made official in 1645, and the larger framework (now called the Westminster Standards) was adopted by the Church of Scotland. In England, the Standards were contested by Independents up to 1660.[23]\\r\\nThe Westminster Divines, on the other hand, were divided over questions of church polity and split into factions supporting a reformed episcopacy, presbyterianism, congregationalism, and Erastianism. The membership of the Assembly was heavily weighted towards the Presbyterians, but Oliver Cromwell was a Congregationalist separatist who imposed his doctrines upon them. The Church of England of the Interregnum (1649ÿ60) was run along Presbyterian lines but never became a national Presbyterian church, such as existed in Scotland, and England was not the theocratic state which leading Puritans had called for as \\"godly rule\\".[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of the English Restoration in 1660, the Savoy Conference was called to determine a new religious settlement for England and Wales. Under the Act of Uniformity 1662, the Church of England was restored to its pre-Civil War constitution with only minor changes, and the Puritans found themselves sidelined. A traditional estimate of historian Calamy is that around 2,400 Puritan clergy left the Church in the \\"Great Ejection\\" of 1662.[25] At this point, the term \\"Dissenter\\" came to include \\"Puritan,\\" but more accurately described those (clergy or lay) who \\"dissented\\" from the 1662 Book of Common Prayer.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Dissenters divided themselves from all Christians in the Church of England and established their own separatist congregations in the 1660s and 1670s. An estimated 1,800 of the ejected clergy continued in some fashion as ministers of religion, according to Richard Baxter.[25] The government initially attempted to suppress these schismatic organisations by using the Clarendon Code. There followed a period in which schemes of \\"comprehension\\" were proposed, under which Presbyterians could be brought back into the Church of England, but nothing resulted from them. The Whigs opposed the court religious policies and argued that the Dissenters should be allowed to worship separately from the established Church, and this position ultimately prevailed when the Toleration Act was passed in the wake of the Glorious Revolution in 1689. This permitted the licensing of Dissenting ministers and the building of chapels. The term \\"Nonconformist\\" generally replaced the term \\"Dissenter\\" from the middle of the 18th century.\\r\\nThe idea of personal Biblical interpretation through the Holy Spirit was central to Puritan beliefs, though it was shared with most Protestants in general at that time. Puritans sought both individual and corporate conformity to the teaching of the Bible, with moral purity pursued down to the smallest detail, as well as ecclesiastical purity to the highest level. They believed that man existed for the glory of God, that his first concern in life was to do God's will and so to receive future happiness. They believed that Jesus Christ was the center of public and personal affairs, and was to be exalted above all other names.[26] The Puritans also believed that God only chose a select number of people to be saved and that the elect could not resist His salvation. The Puritans also saw themselves as superior to everyone else and thought that their religion was the only way to Heaven. [27]\\r\\nVarious strands of Calvinistic theology in the 17th century were taken up by different parts of the Puritan movement and, in particular, Amyraldism was adopted by some influential figures, including John Davenant, Samuel Ward and, to some extent, Richard Baxter. In the same fashion, there is no theory of church polity that is uniquely Puritan, and ideology differed beyond opposition to Erastianism (state control), though even that had its small group of supporters in the Westminster Assembly. Some approved of the existing church hierarchy with bishops, but others sought to reform the Episcopal churches on the Presbyterian model. Some Separatist Puritans were Presbyterian, but most were early Congregationalists. The separating Congregationalists believed that the Divine Right of Kings was heresy but, on the other hand, there were many royalist Presbyterians, in terms of allegiance in the political struggle.\\r\\nMigration also brought out differences and brought together Puritan communities with their own regional customs and beliefs. The New World Puritans' policies of church governance diverged from those remaining in the British Isles, who faced different issues.[28]\\r\\nPuritans believed in the active existence of demonic forces, as did almost all Christians of this period. Puritan pastors undertook exorcisms for demonic possession in some high-profile cases, and believed in some allegations of witchcraft. Exorcist John Darrell was supported by Arthur Hildersham in the case of Thomas Darling.[29] Samuel Harsnett, a skeptic on witchcraft and possession, attacked Darrell. However, Harsnett was in the minority, and many clergy, not only Puritans, believed in witchcraft and possession.[30] The possession case of Richard Dugdale was taken up by ejected nonconformist Thomas Jollie and other local ministers in 1689.\\r\\nThe context of the Salem witch trials of 1692ÿ93 shows the intricacy of trying to place \\"Puritan\\" beliefs as distinctive. The publication of Saducismus Triumphatus, an anti-skeptical tract that has been implicated in the moral panic at Salem, involved Joseph Glanvill (a latitudinarian) and Henry More (a Cambridge Platonist) as editors, and Anthony Horneck, an evangelical German Anglican, as translator of a pamphlet about a Swedish witch hunt. None of these was a Puritan. Glanvill and More had been vehemently opposed in the 1670s by sceptic John Webster, an Independent and sometime chaplain to the Parliamentary forces.\\r\\nPuritan millennialism has been placed in the broader context of European Reformed beliefs about the millennium and interpretation of Biblical prophecy, for which representative figures of the period were Johannes Piscator, Thomas Brightman, Joseph Mede, Johannes Heinrich Alsted, and John Amos Comenius.[31] Both Brightman and Mede were Puritan by conviction, and so are identified as such by their biographers, though neither clashed with the church authorities. David Brady describes a \\"lull before the storm\\" in the early 17th century, in which \\"reasonably restrained and systematic\\" Protestant exegesis of the Book of Revelation was seen with Brightman, Mede, and Hugh Broughton, after which \\"apocalyptic literature became too easily debased\\" as it became more populist and less scholarly.[32]\\r\\nWilliam Lamont argues that, within the church, the Elizabethan millennial beliefs of John Foxe became sidelined, with Puritans adopting instead the \\"centrifugal\\" doctrines of Thomas Brightman, while the Laudians replaced the \\"centripetal\\" attitude of Foxe to the \\"Christian Emperor\\" by the national and episcopal Church closer to home, with its royal head, as leading the Protestant world iure divino (by divine right).[33] Viggo Norskov Olsen writes[34] that Mede \\"broke fully away from the Augustinian-Foxian tradition, and is the link between Brightman and the premillennialism of the 17th century\\".\\r\\nThe dam broke in 1641 when the traditional retrospective reverence for Thomas Cranmer and other martyred bishops in the Acts and Monuments was displaced by forward-looking attitudes to prophecy among radical Puritans.[33]\\r\\nSome strong religious beliefs common to Puritans had direct impacts on culture. Education was essential to the masses so that they could read the Bible for themselves.\\r\\nThe opposition to acting as public performance, typified by William Prynne's book Histriomastix, was not a concern with drama as a form. John Milton wrote Samson Agonistes as verse drama, and had contemplated writing Paradise Lost in that form at an early stage. N.H. Keeble writes:\\r\\n...when Milton essayed drama, it was with explicit Pauline authority and neither intended for the stage nor in the manner of the contemporary theatre.\\r\\nBut the sexualisation of Restoration theatre was attacked as strongly as ever by Thomas Gouge, as Keeble points out.[35] Puritans eliminated the use of musical instruments in their religious services for theological and practical reasons. The only music remaining in church services was the setting of the psalms. Church organs were commonly damaged or destroyed in the Civil War period, such as when an axe was taken to the organ of Worcester Cathedral in 1642.[36]\\r\\nThe Merton Thesis is an argument about the nature of early experimental science proposed by Robert K. Merton. Similar to Max Weber's famous claim on the link between Protestant ethic and the capitalist economy, Merton argued for a similar positive correlation between the rise of Protestant Pietism in Germany and as well English Puritanism and early experimental science.[37] The Merton Thesis has resulted in continuous debates.[38] As an example, seven of 10 nucleus members of the Royal Society were Puritans. In the year 1663 sixty-two percent of the members of the Royal Society were similarly identified.[39]\\r\\nBased on Biblical portrayals of Adam and Eve, Puritans believed that marriage was rooted in procreation, love, and, most importantly, salvation.[40] Husbands were the spiritual heads of the household, while women were to demonstrate religious piety and obedience under male authority.[41] Furthermore, marriage represented not only the relationship between husband and wife, but also the relationship between spouses and God. Puritan husbands commanded authority through family direction and prayer. The female relationship to her husband and to God was marked by submissiveness and humility.[42]\\r\\nThomas Gataker describes Puritan marriage as:\\r\\n... together for a time as copartners in grace here, [that] they may reigne together forever as coheires in glory hereafter.[43]\\r\\nThe paradox created by female inferiority in the public sphere and the spiritual equality of men and women in marriage, then, gave way to the informal authority of women concerning matters of the home and childrearing.[44] With the consent of their husbands, wives made important decisions concerning the labour of their children, property, and the management of inns and taverns owned by their husbands.[45] Pious Puritan mothers laboured for their children's righteousness and salvation, connecting women directly to matters of religion and morality.[46] In her poem titled \\"In Reference to her Children,\\" poet Anne Bradstreet reflects on her role as a mother:\\r\\nI had eight birds hatched in one nest; Four cocks there were, and hens the rest. I nursed them up with pain and care, Nor cost nor labour I did spare.\\r\\nBradstreet alludes to the temporality of motherhood by comparing her children to a flock of birds on the precipice of leaving home. While Puritans praised the obedience of young children, they also believed that, by separating children from their mothers at adolescence, children could better sustain a superior relationship with God.[47] A child could only be redeemed through religious education and obedience. Girls carried the additional burden of Eve's corruption and were catechised separately from boys at adolescence. Boys' education prepared them for vocations and leadership roles, while girls were educated for domestic and religious purposes. The pinnacle of achievement for children in Puritan society, however, occurred with the conversion process.[46]\\r\\nPuritans viewed the relationship between master and servant similarly to that of parent and child. Just as parents were expected to uphold Puritan religious values in the home, masters assumed the parental responsibility of housing and educating young servants. Older servants also dwelt with masters and were cared for in the event of illness or injury. African-American and Indian servants were likely excluded from such benefits.[48]\\r\\nPuritans left for New England, particularly in the years after 1630, supporting the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and other settlements among the northern colonies. The large-scale Puritan emigration to New England ceased by 1641, with around 21,000 having moved across the Atlantic. This English-speaking population in America did not all consist of original colonists, since many returned to England shortly after arriving on the continent, but it produced more than 16 million descendants.[49][50] This so-called \\"Great Migration\\" is not so named because of sheer numbers, which were much less than the number of English citizens who emigrated to Virginia and the Caribbean during this time.[51] The rapid growth of the New England colonies (around 700,000 by 1790) was almost entirely due to the high birth rate and lower death rate per year.[52]\\r\\nPuritan hegemony lasted for at least a century. That century can be broken down into three parts: the generation of John Cotton and Richard Mather, 1630ÿ61 from the founding to the Restoration, years of virtual independence and nearly autonomous development; the generation of Increase Mather, 1662ÿ89 from the Restoration and the Halfway Covenant to the Glorious Revolution, years of struggle with the British crown; and the generation of Cotton Mather, 1689ÿ1728 from the overthrow of Edmund Andros (in which Cotton Mather played a part) and the new charter, mediated by Increase Mather, to the death of Cotton Mather.[53]\\r\\nUnlike the Pilgrims, the Puritans were well prepared and well born; among their number was landed gentry and educated aristocrats. In the area of education, New England differed from its mother country, where nothing in English statute required schoolmasters or the literacy of children. The Puritan model of education in New England was unique, with the possible exception of Scotland. John Winthrop claimed in 1630 that the society which they would form in New England would be \\"as a city upon a hill,\\"[54] and the colony leaders would educate all. These were men of letters. Hampton's founder, the Reverend Stephen Bachiler, had graduated from Oxford, others had attended Cambridge. These men had communicated with intellectuals and aristocrats from all over Europe. In 1636, they founded the school that soon became Harvard College.[55]\\r\\nBesides the Bible, children needed to read to \\"understand ... the capital laws of this country,\\" as the Massachusetts code declared, order being of the utmost importance, and children not taught to read would grow \\"barbarous\\" (the 1648 amendment to the Massachusetts law and the 1650 Connecticut code both used the word \\"barbarisme\\"). By the 1670s, all New England colonies except Rhode Island had passed legislation that mandated literacy for children. In 1647, Massachusetts passed a law that required towns to hire a schoolmaster to teach writing.\\r\\nForms of schooling ranged from dame schools to \\"Latin\\" schools for boys already literate in English and ready to master preparatory grammar for Latin, Hebrew, and Greek. Reading schools were often the single source of education for girls, whereas boys would go to the town grammar schools. Gender largely determined educational practices; women introduced all children to reading, and men taught boys in higher pursuits. Latin grammar schools did not accept girls (nor did Harvard), since grammar schools were designed to \\"instruct youth so far as they may be fited for the university,\\" and girls could play no role in the ministry. Most evidence suggests that girls could not attend the less ambitious town schools, the lower-tier writing-reading schools mandated for townships of over 50 families.\\r\\nThe Plymouth Colony Puritans of New England disapproved of Christmas celebrations, as did some other Protestant churches of the time. Celebration was outlawed in Boston from 1659.[56] The ban was revoked in 1681 by the English-appointed governor Edmund Andros, who also revoked a Puritan ban on festivities on Saturday nights.[56] Nevertheless, it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became fashionable in the Boston region.[57] Likewise, the colonies banned many secular entertainments on moral grounds, such as drama and games of chance.[58]\\r\\nThey were not, however, opposed to drinking alcohol in moderation.[59] Early New England laws banning the sale of alcohol to Native Americans were criticised because it was \\"not fit to deprive Indians of any lawfull comfort aloweth to all men by the use of wine.\\" Laws banned the practice of individuals toasting each other, with the explanation that it led to wasting God's gift of beer and wine, as well as being carnal. Bounds were not set on enjoying sexuality within the bounds of marriage, as a gift from God.[60] Spouses were disciplined if they did not perform their sexual marital duties, in accordance with 1 Corinthians 7 and other biblical passages. Women and men were equally expected to fulfill marital responsibilities.[61] Women and men could file for divorce based on this issue alone. In Massachusetts colony, which had some of the most liberal colonial divorce laws, one out of every six divorce petitions was filed on the basis on male impotence.[62]\\r\\nThe Puritans exhibited intolerance to other religious views, including Quaker, Anglican and Baptist theologies. The Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony were the most active of the New England persecutors of Quakers, and the persecuting spirit was shared by the Plymouth Colony and the colonies along the Connecticut river.[63]\\r\\nIn 1660, one of the most notable victims of the religious intolerance was English Quaker Mary Dyer, who was hanged in Boston for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony.[63] She was one of the four executed Quakers known as the Boston martyrs. The hanging of Dyer on Boston Common marked the beginning of the end of the Puritan theocracy.[64] In 1661, King Charles II explicitly forbade Massachusetts from executing anyone for professing Quakerism.[64] In 1684, England revoked the Massachusetts charter, sent over a royal governor to enforce English laws in 1686 and, in 1689, passed a broad Toleration Act.[64]\\r\\nThe first two of the four Boston martyrs were executed by the Puritans on 27 October 1659, and in memory of this, 27 October is now International Religious Freedom Day to recognise the importance of freedom of religion.[65] Anti-Catholic sentiment appeared in New England with the first Pilgrim and Puritan settlers.[66] In 1647, Massachusetts passed a law prohibiting any Jesuit Roman Catholic priests from entering territory under Puritan jurisdiction.[67] Any suspected person who could not clear himself was to be banished from the colony; a second offense carried a death penalty.[68]\\r\\nAlexis de Tocqueville suggested in Democracy in America that Puritanism was the very thing that provided a firm foundation for American democracy. As Sheldon Wolin puts it, \\"Tocqueville was aware of the harshness and bigotry of the early colonists\\". However, on the other hand, he saw them as \\"archaic survivals, not only in their piety and discipline but in their democratic practices\\".[69] The theme of a religious basis of economic discipline is echoed in sociologist Max Weber's work, but both de Tocqueville and Weber argued that this discipline was not a force of economic determinism, but one factor among many that should be considered when evaluating the relative economic success of the Puritans.\\r\\nThe literature on Puritans, particularly biographical literature on individual Puritan ministers, was already voluminous in the 17th century and, indeed, the interests of Puritans in the narratives of early life and conversions made the recording of the internal lives important to them. The historical literature on Puritans is, however, quite problematic and subject to controversies over interpretation. The early writings are those of the defeated, excluded and victims. The great interest of authors of the 19th century in Puritan figures was routinely accused in the 20th century of consisting of anachronism and the reading back of contemporary concerns.\\r\\nA debate continues on the definition of \\"Puritanism\\".[70] English historian Patrick Collinson believes that \\"Puritanism had no content beyond what was attributed to it by its opponents.\\"[71] The analysis of \\"mainstream Puritanism\\" in terms of the evolution from it of Separatist and antinomian groups that did not flourish, and others that continue to this day, such as Baptists and Quakers, can suffer in this way. The national context (England and Wales, as well as the kingdoms of Scotland and Ireland) frames the definition of Puritans, but was not a self-identification for those Protestants who saw the progress of the Thirty Years' War from 1620 as directly bearing on their denomination, and as a continuation of the religious wars of the previous century, carried on by the English Civil Wars. English historian Christopher Hill, who has contributed to analyses of Puritan concerns that are more respected than accepted, writes of the 1630s, old church lands, and the accusations that William Laud was a crypto-Catholic:\\r\\nTo the heightened Puritan imagination it seemed that, all over Europe, the lamps were going out: the Counter-Reformation was winning back property for the church as well as souls: and Charles I and his government, if not allied to the forces of the Counter-Reformation, at least appeared to have set themselves identical economic and political objectives.[72]\\r\\nPuritans were politically important in England, but it is debated whether the movement was in any way a party with policies and leaders before the early 1640s. While Puritanism in New England was important culturally for a group of colonial pioneers in America, there have been many studies trying to pin down exactly what the identifiable cultural component was. Fundamentally, historians remain dissatisfied with the grouping as \\"Puritan\\" as a working concept for historical explanation. The conception of a Protestant work ethic, identified more closely with Calvinist or Puritan principles, has been criticised at its root,[by whom?] mainly as a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy aligning economic success with a narrow religious scheme.","input":"What type of political communities did puritans form?"},{"output":"Downtown Austin","context":"The Texas State Capitol, completed in 1888 in Downtown Austin, contains the offices and chambers of the Texas Legislature and the Office of the Governor. Designed in 1881 by architect Elijah E. Myers, it was constructed from 1882 to 1888 under the direction of civil engineer Reuben Lindsay Walker. A $75 million underground extension was completed in 1993. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.[2][3] The Texas State Capitol is 302.64 feet (92.24?m) tall, making it the sixth tallest state capitol and one of several taller than the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current Texas State Capitol is the third building to serve that purpose. The second Texas capitol was built in 1853, on the same site as the present capitol in Austin; it was destroyed in the great capitol fire of 1881, but plans had already been made to replace it with a new, much larger structure.[5]\\r\\nConstruction of the Italian Renaissance Revivalÿstyle capitol was funded by an article of the state constitution, adopted on February 15, 1876, which authorized the sale of public lands for the purpose. In one of the largest barter transactions of recorded history, the builders of the capitol (John V. Farwell and Charles B. Farwell), known as the Capitol Syndicate, were paid with more than three million acres (12,000?km2) of public land in the \\"Panhandle\\" region of Texas; this tract later became the largest cattle ranch in the world, the XIT Ranch. The value of the land, combined with expenses, added to a total cost of $3.7 million for the original building. It was constructed largely by convicts or migrant workers, as many as a thousand at a time.[6] The building has been renovated several times, with central air conditioning installed in 1955 and the most recent refurbishments completed in 1997.\\r\\nThe designers originally planned for the building to be clad entirely with hill country limestone quarried in Oatmanville (present-day Oak Hill), about 10 miles (16?km) to the southwest. However, the high iron content of the limestone led it to rapidly discolor with rust stains when exposed to the elements. Learning of the problem, the owners of Granite Mountain near Marble Falls offered to donate to the state, free of charge, the necessary amount of sunset red granite as an alternative. To transport the red granite, the Austin and Northwestern Railroad was extended 2.3 miles (3.7 km) to accommodate the transportation from Granite Mountain.[7] Due to a bend in the tracks, trains would occasionally derail, accidentally dumping some of the pink granite.[8] Many of the fallen rocks remain in place and are a local point of interest. While the building is mostly built of the Oak Hill limestone, most of this is hidden behind the walls and on the foundations. Red granite was subsequently used for many state government buildings in the Austin area.[9] The project's 900 workers included 86 granite cutters brought from Scotland.[10]\\r\\nThe cornerstone for the building was laid on March 2, 1885, Texas Independence Day, and the building was opened to the public on April 21, 1888, San Jacinto Day, before its completion. The building was officially dedicated by Texas State Senator Temple Houston on May 18, 1888.[10] The dedication ceremony was marked by a weeklong celebration from May 14-19, 1888, that attracted nearly 20,000 visitors and included events such as military drill demonstrations, cattle roping, baseball games, German choral singing, and fireworks. Guests were able to purchase souvenirs such as pieces of red granite and copies of a song written by composer and pianist Leonora Rives-Diaz called the \\"State Capitol Grand Waltz\\".[11]\\r\\nIn 1931, the City of Austin enacted a local ordinance limiting the height of new buildings to a maximum of 200 feet (61?m), aiming to preserve the visual preeminence of the capitol. From that time until the early 1960s, only the University of Texas Main Building Tower was built higher than the limit, but in 1962 developers announced a new 261-foot (80?m) high-rise residential building to be built adjacent to the capitol, called the Westgate Tower. Governor Price Daniel voiced his opposition to the proposed tower, and State Representative Henry Grover of Houston introducing a bill to condemn the property, which was defeated in the Texas House of Representatives by only two votes. The Westgate was eventually completed in 1966, but the controversy over the preservation of the capitol's visual presence that dogged its construction continued to grow.[12]\\r\\nThe Westgate was followed by even taller structures: first the Dobie Center (designed in 1968), and then a series of ever larger downtown bank towers, culminating in the 395-foot (120?m) One American Center (designed in 1982).[12] In early 1983, inspired by the Westgate and these other structures, State Senator Lloyd Doggett and State Representative Gerald Hill advanced a bill proposing a list of protected \\"Capitol View Corridors\\" along which construction would not be permitted, so as to protect the capitol's visibility from a series of points around Austin.[13] The bill was signed into law on May 3, 1983,[14] defining thirty state-protected viewing corridors and prohibiting any construction that would intersect one of them.[15] The City of Austin has adopted similar rules, so that the majority of the corridors are also protected under municipal zoning code, as well as under state law.[16]\\r\\nOn February 6, 1983, a fire began in the apartment of William P. Hobby Jr., then the state lieutenant governor. A guest of Hobby's was killed, and four firemen and a policeman were injured by the subsequent blaze. The capitol was crowded with accumulated archives, and the fire was intense and came dangerously close to destroying the structure. It caused severe damage to the east wing and compromised much of the framing, which was largely composed of exposed cast iron posts and beams.\\r\\nFollowing the fire, the state took advantage of the extensive rebuilding to update the mechanical and structural systems to modern standards. In November 1985, the original Goddess of Liberty statue on top of the dome was removed by helicopter. A new statue, cast of aluminum in molds made from the original zinc statue, was placed on the dome in June 1986. The original statue was restored and displayed on the Capitol grounds in a special structure built for it in 1995; it was later moved to the Bullock Texas State History Museum in 2001.[17]\\r\\nAdditionally, the state sought to address the intensifying shortage of space in the old building, deciding that a new office wing should be added. The logical place for an addition was the plaza immediately to the north; however, a large building there would have eliminated the historic north fa?ade and covered what had traditionally been seen as an important public space. Instead, an expansion to the capitol was built beneath the north plaza, connecting to the existing capital underground.\\r\\nIn 1993, the $75 million, four-story, underground capitol extension was completed to the north, doubling the square footage available to capitol occupants and providing much-improved functionality. Though the extension encompasses 667,000 square feet (62,000?m2) (nearly twice the floor space of the original building), there is little evidence of such a large structure at ground level, except for extensive skylights camouflaged as planter rows, and the four-story open-air inverted rotunda.[18]\\r\\nIn 1995, a comprehensive interior and exterior restoration of the original building was completed at a cost of approximately $98 million. In 1997, the park-like grounds surrounding the capitol received an $8 million renovation and restoration.\\r\\nThe capitol building and grounds are located in downtown Austin, with the main entrance facing onto the Congress Avenue Historic District to the south. The northern edge of the grounds lies four blocks south of the University of Texas at Austin.\\r\\nThe capitol has 360,000 square feet (33,000?m2) of floor space (not including the Capitol Extension), more than any other state capitol building, and rests on 2.25 acres (0.91?ha) of land. The building has nearly four hundred rooms and more than nine hundred windows. The interior of the central rotunda features portraits of every person who has served as president of the Republic of Texas or governor of the State of Texas; the rotunda is also a whispering gallery. The south foyer features a large portrait of David Crockett, a painting depicting the surrender of General Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto, and sculptures of Sam Houston and Stephen F. Austin made by Elisabet Ney.\\r\\nThe Texas State Capitol was ranked ninety-second in the \\"America's Favorite Architecture\\" poll commissioned by the American Institute of Architects, that ranked the top 150 favorite architectural projects in America as of 2007. In a 2008 poll by the AIA, it was also ranked the number-one state capitol.[19]\\r\\nThe Capitol building is surrounded by 22 acres (8.9?ha) of grounds scattered with statues and monuments. William Munro Johnson, civil engineer, was hired in 1888 to improve the appearance of the grounds. By the time the first monument, commemorating the Heroes of the Alamo, was installed in 1891, the major components of Johnson's plan were in place. These included a \\"Great Walk\\" of black and white diamond-patterned pavement shaded by trees.

It is also known as half-byte[3] or tetrade.[4][5] In a networking or telecommunication context, the nibble is often called a semi-octet,[6] quadbit,[7] or quartet.[8][9] A nibble has sixteen (24) possible values. A nibble can be represented by a single hexadecimal digit and called a hex digit.[10]\\r\\nA full byte (octet) is represented by two hexadecimal digits; therefore, it is common to display a byte of information as two nibbles. Sometimes the set of all 256 byte values is represented as a 16G16 table, which gives easily readable hexadecimal codes for each value.\\r\\nFour-bit computer architectures use groups of four bits as their fundamental unit. Such architectures were used in early microprocessors, pocket calculators and pocket computers. They continue to be used in some microcontrollers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term 'nibble' originates from its representing 'half a byte', with 'byte' a homophone of the English word 'bite'.[3] In 2014, David B. Benson, a professor emeritus at Washington State University, remembered that he playfully used (and may have possibly coined) the term nibble as \\"half a byte\\" and unit of storage required to hold a binary-coded decimal (BCD) decimal digit around 1958, when talking to a programmer of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. The alternative spelling 'nybble' reflects the spelling of 'byte', as noted in editorials of Kilobaud and Byte in the early 1980s. Another early recorded use of the term 'nybble' was in 1977 within the consumer-banking technology group at Citibank. It created a pre-ISO 8583 standard for transactional messages between cash machines and Citibank's data centers that used the basic informational unit 'NABBLE'.\\r\\nThe nibble is used to describe the amount of memory used to store a digit of a number stored in packed decimal format (BCD) within an IBM mainframe. This technique is used to make computations faster and debugging easier. An 8-bit byte is split in half and each nibble is used to store one decimal digit. The last (rightmost) nibble of the variable is reserved for the sign. Thus a variable which can store up to nine digits would be \\"packed\\" into 5 bytes. Ease of debugging resulted from the numbers being readable in a hex dump where two hex numbers are used to represent the value of a byte, as 16G16 = 28. For example, a five-byte BCD value of 31?41?59?26?5C represents a decimal value of +314159265.\\r\\nHistorically, there are cases where nybble was used for a group of bits greater than 4. In the Apple II microcomputer line, much of the disk drive control and group-coded recording was implemented in software. Writing data to a disk was done by converting 256-byte pages into sets of 5-bit (later, 6-bit) nibbles and loading disk data required the reverse.[11][12][13] Moreover, 1982 documentation for the Integrated Woz Machine refers consistently to an \\"8 bit nibble\\".[14] The term byte once had the same ambiguity and meant a set of bits but not necessarily 8, hence the distinction of bytes and octets or of nibbles and quartets (or quadbits). Today, the terms 'byte' and 'nibble' almost always refer to 8-bit and 4-bit collections respectively and are very rarely used to express any other sizes.\\r\\nThe terms 'semi-nibble' or 'nibblet' have occasionally been used to refer to half a nibble,[citation needed] but the usage of dibit for two bits[15][16][7][17] is more common.\\r\\nThe sixteen nibbles and their equivalents in other numeral systems:\\r\\nThe terms \\"low nibble\\" and \\"high nibble\\" are used to denote the nibbles containing, respectively, the less significant bits and the more significant bits within a byte. In graphical representations of bits within a byte, the leftmost bit could represent the most significant bit (MSB), corresponding to ordinary decimal notation in which the digit at the left of a number is the most significant. In such illustrations the four bits on the left end of the byte form the high nibble, and the remaining four bits form the low nibble.[18] For example,\\r\\nninety-seven = 9710 = (0110 0001)2\\r\\nthe high nibble is 01102 (6), and the low nibble is 00012 (1). The total value is high-nibble G 16 + low-nibble (6G16+1=97).\\r\\nIn the C programming language:\\r\\nwhere b must be a variable or constant of an integral data type, and only the least-significant byte of b is used.\\r\\nFor example, HI_NIBBLE(0xAB)==0xA and LO_NIBBLE(0xAB)==0xB.\\r\\nIn Common Lisp:","input":"What is a group of 4 bits called?"},{"output":"first published in 1910","context":"\\"Streets of Laredo\\" (Laws B01, Roud 23650),[1] also known as the \\"Cowboy's Lament\\", is a famous American cowboy ballad in which a dying cowboy tells his story to another cowboy. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.[2]\\r\\nDerived from the English folk song \\"The Unfortunate Rake\\", the song has become a folk music standard, and as such has been performed, recorded and adapted numerous times, with many variations. The title refers to the city of Laredo, Texas.\\r\\nThe old-time cowboy Frank H. Maynard (1853ÿ1926) of Colorado Springs, Colorado, claimed authorship of the revised Cowboy's Lament, and his story was widely reported in 1924 by the journalism professor Elmo Scott Watson, then on the faculty of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I walked out in the streets of Laredo\\r\\nAs I walked out in Laredo one day,\\r\\nI spied a poor cowboy, all wrapped in white linen\\r\\nAll wrapped in white linen and cold as the clay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"I see by your outfit, that you are a cowboy.\\"\\r\\nThese words he did say as I slowly passed by.\\r\\n\\"Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story,\\r\\nFor I'm shot in the chest, and today I must die.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"'Twas once in the saddle I used to go dashing,\\r\\n'Twas once in the saddle I used to go gay.\\r\\nFirst down to Rosie's, and then to the card-house,\\r\\nGot shot in the chest, and I'm dying today.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Oh, beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly,\\r\\nAnd play the dead march as you carry me along;\\r\\nTake me to the green valley, there lay the sod o'er me,\\r\\nFor I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.\\"\\r\\n\\"Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin,\\r\\nGet six pretty maidens to bear up my pall.\\r\\nPut bunches of roses all over my coffin,\\r\\nRoses to deaden the clods as they fall.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Then swing your rope slowly and rattle your spurs lowly,\\r\\nAnd give a wild whoop as you carry me along;\\r\\nAnd in the grave throw me and roll the sod o'er me.\\r\\nFor I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Go bring me a cup, a cup of cold water.\\r\\nTo cool my parched lips\\", the cowboy then said.\\r\\nBefore I returned, his spirit had departed,\\r\\nAnd gone to the round up ÿ the cowboy was dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly,\\r\\nAnd bitterly wept as we bore him along.\\r\\nFor we loved our comrade, so brave, young and handsome,\\r\\nWe all loved our comrade, although he'd done wrong.\\r\\nThe song is widely considered to be a traditional ballad. It was first published in 1910 in John Lomax's Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads.[4][5]\\r\\nThe lyrics appear to be primarily descended from an Irish folk song of the late 18th century called \\"The Unfortunate Rake\\",[6] which also evolved (with a time signature change and completely different melody) into the New Orleans standard \\"St. James Infirmary Blues\\". The Irish ballad shares a melody with the British sea-song \\"Spanish Ladies\\". The Bodleian Library, Oxford, has copies of a 19th-century broadside entitled \\"The Unfortunate Lad\\", which is a version of the British ballad.[7] Some elements of this song closely presage those in the \\"Streets of Laredo\\" and in the \\"St. James Infirmary Blues\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nRecordings of the song have been made by Eddy Arnold, Johnny Cash, Joan Baez, Burl Ives, Jim Reeves, Roy Rogers, Marty Robbins, Chet Atkins, Arlo Guthrie, Norman Luboff Choir, Rex Allen, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and many country and western singers, as well as avant garde rocker John Cale, the British pop group Prefab Sprout, Snakefarm, Mercury Rev, Jane Siberry, Suzanne Vega and Paul Westerberg. There is also a version on RCA's How The West Was Won double album, Bing Crosby ?ÿ  1960. Harry James recorded a version on his 1966 album Harry James & His Western Friends (Dot DLP 3735 and DLP 25735).\\r\\nThe song plays a prominent role in the book and film Bang the Drum Slowly, in which a version of the song is sung. The words from the title replace the words \\"beat the drum slowly\\" from the lyrics below. This in turn is the phrase used in the song \\"Bang the Drum Slowly\\" on the album Red Dirt Girl by Emmylou Harris. The song is featured in the films Brokeback Mountain and Night on Earth. John Ford used the song in his 1948 movie \\"Three Godfathers\\" and was sung by Harry Carey, Jr. [IMdb]. The lyrics are also (indirectly) the source of the title of Peter S. Beagle's 1965 travelogue of a cross-USA trip by Heinkel scooter, \\"I See by My Outfit.\\" It was also sung by the character Al Swearengen in an episode of the TV series Deadwood, by the character Bret Maverick in the episode 'The Belcastle Brand' of the TV series Maverick, and by the character Martin Kellum in the episode 'Song for Dying' of the TV series Gunsmoke. It is also memorably sung by Italian actor/comedian Roberto Benigni in Jim Jarmusch's 1986 breakout movie Down By Law. Roberto Benigni sings \\"Streets of Laredo\\" in Jim Jarmusch's 1991 movie, \\"Night on Earth.\\"\\r\\nVince Gill recorded a version of three verses of the Irish ballad The Bard of Armagh (which takes the same tune) followed by three verses of this song on the album Long Journey Home, a compilation of songs about Irish emigration and the links between Irish and American folk and country music also featuring Van Morrison, the Chieftans, Mary Black, Elvis Costello and others, in 1998.\\r\\nThe same tune is used for the Irish lament \\"Bold Robert Emmet\\" and the sea chanty \\"Spanish Ladies\\" .\\r\\nLouis MacNeice wrote a poem called \\"The Streets of Laredo\\" about the bombing of London during World War Two. The rhythms of the poem resemble the lyrics of the song, and the 1948 book Holes in the Sky states that his wife Hedli Anderson sang the poem.\\r\\nThe Kingston Trio performed this comedy version as \\"Laredo?\\" on their 1961 album College Concert:\\r\\nAs I walked down in the streets of Laredo.\\r\\nAs I walked down in Laredo one day,\\r\\nI spied a young cowboy dressed in white linen,\\r\\nDressed in white linen and cold as the clay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"I can see by your outfit that you are a cowboy.\\"\\r\\n\\"You can see by my outfit I'm a cowboy too.\\"\\r\\n\\"You can see by our outfits that we are both cowboys.\\"\\r\\n\\"Get yourself an outfit, and be a cowboy too.\\"\\r\\nThe Smothers Brothers performed a similar comedy version on their 1962 album The Two Sides of the Smothers Brothers.\\r\\nPeter S. Beagle's travelogue \\"I See By My Outfit\\" takes its name from this version of the song; in the book, he and his friend Phil refer to it as their \\"theme song.\\"\\r\\nAllan Sherman also performed a parody of the song; his version was titled \\"Streets of Miami\\", and was about vacationing Manhattan lawyers. Garrison Keillor's album Songs of the Cat has a feline-themed parody, \\"As I Walked Out\\".\\r\\nMarty Robbins' 1959 album Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs features his hit \\"El Paso\\", similar in form and content to \\"Streets of Laredo\\". The 1960 follow-up More Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs has a version of the original.\\r\\nA portion of \\"Streets of Laredo\\" was sung by a group of cowboys in Season 2, Episode 5: Estralita on the TV show Wanted Dead or Alive which first aired on 10/3/1959.[8]\\r\\nThe lyrics of Pete Seeger's \\"Ballad of Sherman Wu\\" are patterned after \\"Streets of Laredo'\\" and is set to the same tune. The song presages the American Civil Rights Movement and recounts the refusal of Northwestern University's Psi Upsilon fraternity to accept Sherman Wu because of his Chinese heritage. The song deliberately echoes \\"Streets of Laredo\\", beginning:[9]\\r\\nAs I was out walking the streets of Northwestern,\\r\\nI spied a young freshman, dejected and blue.\\r\\nAnd so when I asked him, \\"Why are you dejected?\\",\\r\\nHe said \\"I'm Chinese, and I can't join Psi U.\\"\\r\\nThe words of the labor song \\"The Ballad of Bloody Thursday\\" ÿ inspired by a deadly clash between strikers and police during the 1934 San Francisco longshoremen's strike ÿ also follow the \\"Streets of Laredo\\" pattern and tune.\\r\\nAs for The Cowboy's Lament/Streets of Laredo itself, Austin E. and Alta S. Fife in Songs of the Cowboys (1966) say,\\r\\nThere are hundreds of texts, with variants so numerous that scholars will never assemble and analyze them all.\\r\\nNote that some versions of printed lyrics, such as Lomax's 1910 version, have been bowdlerized, eliminating, for example, subtle mentions of drunkenness and/or prostitution. Johnny Cash's 1965 recording substitutes \\"dram-house\\" for the traditional \\"Rosie's,\\" i.e. the saloon for the brothel (though Burl Ives' 1949 recording retains the more logical, \\"first down to Rosie's, and then to the card-house...\\"). This bowdlerization renders nonsensical the next phrase, \\"...and then to the card-house,\\" as though drinking and gambling took place in separate establishments. One of the Fifes' sources \\"exaggerating somewhat, says that there were originally seventy stanzas, sixty-nine of which had to be whistled.\\"[10]\\r\\nAn intermediately bowdlerized version of \\"The Cowboy's Lament\\":\\r\\n'Twas once in my saddle I used to be happy\\r\\n'Twas once in my saddle I used to be gay\\r\\nBut I first took to drinking, then to gambling\\r\\nA shot from a six-shooter took my life away.\\r\\nBeat your drums lightly, play your fifes merrily\\r\\nSing your dearth march as you bear me along\\r\\nTake me to the grave yard, lay the sod o'er me\\r\\nI'm a young cow-boy and know I've done wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy curse let it rest, rest on the fair one\\r\\nWho drove me from friends that I loved and from home\\r\\nWho told me she loved me, just to deceive me\\r\\nMy curse rest upon her, wherever she roam.\\r\\nBeat your drums lightly, play your fifes merrily\\r\\nSing your dearth march as you bear me along\\r\\nTake me to the grave yard, lay the sod o'er me\\r\\nI'm a young cow-boy and know I've done wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh she was fair, Oh she was lovely\\r\\nThe belle of the Village the fairest of all\\r\\nBut her heart was as cold as the snow on the mountains\\r\\nShe gave me up for the glitter of gold.\\r\\nBeat your drums lightly, play your fifes merrily\\r\\nSing your dearth march as you bear me along\\r\\nTake me to the grave yard, lay the sod o'er me\\r\\nI'm a young cow-boy and know I've done wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nI arrived in Galveston in old Texas\\r\\nDrinking and gambling I went to give o'er\\r\\nBut, I met with a Greaser and my life he has finished\\r\\nHome and relations I ne'er shall see more.\\r\\nBeat your drums lightly, play your fifes merrily\\r\\nSing your dearth march as you bear me along\\r\\nTake me to the grave yard, lay the sod o'er me\\r\\nI'm a young cow-boy and know I've done wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nSend for my Father.

C. Carroll is an updated version of this ballad.\\r\\nThe composer Samuel Barber adapted a variation on the \\"Streets of Laredo\\" tune as the principal theme in the \\"Allegretto\\" movement of Excursions, op. 20.\\r\\nThe tune was used for The Homing Waltz, a song written by Johnny Reine and Tommie Connor and recorded by Vera Lynn in 1952.\\r\\nDifferent words and a chorus were added in 1960 under the title \\"Only The Heartaches\\" by Wayne P. Walker, with additional words by Jess Edwins and Terry Kennedy. It was a minor hit in some countries by Houston Wells and The Marksmen and has been recorded by many other artists. The chorus begins \\"There's gold in the mountains, gold in the valleys...\\"\\r\\nThe song \\"Blackwatertown\\" by The Handsome Family is another updated version of this song, framing the narrator's downfall as the resultant of an affair with a young woman employed in the publishing industry. It was released on The Rose And The Briar, a 2004 CD compilation and companion to The Rose & the Briar: Death, Love and Liberty in the American Ballad, edited by Sean Wilentz and Greil Marcus.\\r\\nThe game Fallout: New Vegas contains a song called \\"The Streets of New Reno\\", performed by JE Sawyer. That song is \\"The Streets of Laredo\\" as adapted into the Fallout universe\\r\\nThe song \\"The Streets of Laredo\\" appears on the albums Sings the Ballads of the True West and American IV by Johnny Cash. Cash also recorded two other versions with different lyrics on his first Christmas album (1963), and then again as \\"The Walls of a Prison\\" on his From Sea to Shining Sea album in 1967.\\r\\n\\"When I Was a Young Girl\\", a female version of the same theme, was popular on the folk music circuits in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and was recorded by Barbara Dane and Odetta before being revived by Nina Simone and Leslie Feist.\\r\\nIn 1995, Judy Collins used the tune of \\"Streets of Laredo\\" for the song \\"Bard of my Heart\\", about her late son Clark, on her album, Shameless.\\r\\nThe tune and lyrics of \\"Streets of Laredo\\" were used in the 1973 film Bang the Drum Slowly, a sports drama based on Mark Harris's novel of the same name.

The application was denied in March 2001 for various reasons, including concerns about the amount of visitor contact with the cats, lack of any trained zoological professionals on staff, insufficient formal veterinary programs and unfinished perimeter fencing.[8] The sanctuary has ceased physical encounters of any kind between the public and cats housed there in 2003.

Baskin responded that the cage was compliant with law when it was built.[12]\\r\\nOne of the main goals of Big Cat Rescue is to end ownership and trade of exotic felines in the private sector entirely.[14] Big Cat Rescue claims that permit systems are not effective at ensuring animal welfare and campaigns for a total ban of private ownership of big cats regardless of keeping conditions.[15] The center is part of the International Tiger Coalition, which is dedicated to stopping the trade of tiger parts.[16]\\r\\nIn 2005, Big Cat Rescue published an action plan to end all captive keeping of all exotic cats, including animals in AZA-accredited zoos bred for conservation.[17] According to the plan, Big Cat Rescue wanted interstate transport of big cats for any reason (including conservation breeding programs) to end by 2012, display of large exotic cats in zoos to end by 2013 and keeping of any exotic cats (including smaller species) in zoos to be discontinued by 2015.[17]\\r\\nIn 2015, owner Carole Baskin began campaigning for the passage of a bill in the United States Congress called The Big Cat Public Safety Act (H.R. 3546)[18] that would ban all future keeping of all large cat species in the United States, with zoos certified by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, as well as certain sanctuaries, universities, wildlife rehabilitators, and traveling circuses being exempt.[19]\\r\\nIn January 2011, the center received attention for its rescue of \\"Skip\\", a bobcat, who had likely been hit by a car on Florida State Road 46 and had a crushed pelvis.
