It brought to an end the first phase of the power struggle between the Papacy and the Holy Roman Emperors and has been interpreted as containing within itself the germ of nation - based sovereignty that would one day be confirmed in the Peace of Westphalia ( 1648 ) . In part this was an unforeseen result of strategic maneuvering between the Church and the European sovereigns over political control within their domains . The King was recognised as having the right to invest bishops with secular authority ( \`\` by the lance '' ) in the territories they governed , but not with sacred authority ( \`\` by ring and staff '' ) . The result was that bishops owed allegiance in worldly matters both to the pope and to the king , for they were obliged to affirm the right of the sovereign to call upon them for military support , under his oath of fealty . Previous Holy Roman Emperors had thought it their right , granted by God , to name Church officials within their territories ( such as bishops ) and to confirm the Papal election ( and , at times of extraordinary urgency , actually name popes ) . In fact , the Emperors had been heavily relying on bishops for their secular administration , as they were not hereditary or quasi-hereditary nobility with family interests . A more immediate result of the Investiture struggle identified a proprietary right that adhered to sovereign territory , recognising the right of kings to income from the territory of a vacant diocese and a basis for justifiable taxation . These rights lay outside feudalism , which defined authority in a hierarchy of personal relations , with only a loose relation to territory . The pope emerged as a figure above and out of the direct control of the Holy Roman Emperor ."},{"query":"who was the heading indian army during bangladesh liberation war of 1971","short_answer":"Indian Armed Forces","abstract":"Provisional Government of Bangladesh"},{"query":"difference between coopers pale ale and sparkling ale","short_answer":"","abstract":"Coopers Brewery Limited , the largest Australian - owned brewery , is based in the Adelaide suburb of Regency Park .

The diverted fluid ( liquid , gas or liquid -- gas mixture ) is usually routed through a piping system known as a flare header or relief header to a central , elevated gas flare where it is usually burned and the resulting combustion gases are released to the atmosphere . As the fluid is diverted , the pressure inside the vessel will stop rising . Once it reaches the valve 's reseating pressure , the valve will close . The blowdown is usually stated as a percentage of set pressure and refers to how much the pressure needs to drop before the valve reseats . The blowdown can vary from roughly 2 -- 20 % , and some valves have adjustable blowdowns ."},{"query":"what was a major effect of the decline of the roman empire","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Fall of the Western Roman Empire ( also called Fall of the Roman Empire or Fall of Rome ) was the process of decline in the Western Roman Empire in which it failed to enforce its rule , and its vast territory was divided into several successor polities .

Those exempt from the new rule are said to have grandfather rights or acquired rights , or to have been grandfathered in . Frequently , the exemption is limited ; it may extend for a set time , or it may be lost under certain circumstances . For example , a \`\` grandfathered power plant '' might be exempt from new , more restrictive pollution laws , but the exception may be revoked and the new rules would apply if the plant were expanded . Often , such a provision is used as a compromise or out of practicality , to allow new rules to be enacted without upsetting a well - established logistical or political situation . This extends the idea of a rule not being retroactively applied . Another common example of a grandfather clause is a customer of a utility or telecommunications service who pays a certain rate and maintains that rate even if other subscribers and new subscribers face higher or increasing rates . If it is an unlimited clause it continues indefinitely and is only cancelled if the subscriber discontinues the services , fails to pay their bill ( s ) or makes certain changes to their contract ."},{"query":"is it legal to carry a gun in south africa","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"who was the first person went to space","short_answer":"Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin","abstract":"Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin ( Russian : Ю́рий Алексе́евич Гага́рин ; IPA : ( ˈjʉrjɪj ɐljɪˈksjejɪvjɪtɕ ɡɐˈɡarjɪn ) ; 9 March 1934 -- 27 March 1968 ) was a Soviet pilot and cosmonaut .

It is the energy associated with the motion and position of an object . The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that in an isolated system that is only subject to conservative forces , the mechanical energy is constant . If an object is moved in the opposite direction of a conservative net force , the potential energy will increase and if the speed ( not the velocity ) of the object is changed , the kinetic energy of the object is changed as well . In all real systems , however , nonconservative forces , like frictional forces , will be present , but often they are of negligible values and the mechanical energy 's being constant can therefore be a useful approximation . In elastic collisions , the mechanical energy is conserved but in inelastic collisions , some mechanical energy is converted into heat . The equivalence between lost mechanical energy ( dissipation ) and an increase in temperature was discovered by James Prescott Joule ."},{"query":"who does the president give his resignation to","short_answer":"","abstract":"The President of the Republic of India is the head of state of India and the commander - in - chief of the Indian Armed Forces ."},{"query":"who plays mrs robinson in meet the robinsons","short_answer":"Nicole Sullivan","abstract":"Meet the Robinsons is a 2007 American computer - animated science fiction comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures on March 30 , 2007 .

Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases . In the first phase , the Archidamian War , Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica , while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire . This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese . In 415 BC , Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily ; the attack failed disastrously , with the destruction of the entire force , in 413 BC . This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy . The destruction of Athens ' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war , and Athens surrendered in the following year .

These tables can be used to examine the genotypic outcome probabilities of the offspring of a single trait ( allele ) , or when crossing multiple traits from the parents .

Studies of the Venusian surface are based on imaging , radar , and altimetry data collected from several exploratory space probes , particularly Magellan , since 1961 ( see Venus Exploration ) . Despite its similarities to Earth in size , mass , density , and possibly composition , Venus has a unique geology that is unlike Earth 's . Although much older than Earth 's , the surface of Venus is relatively young compared to other terrestrial planets ( < 500 million years old ) , possibly due to a global - scale resurfacing event that buried much of the previous rock record . Venus is believed to have approximately the same bulk elemental composition as Earth , due to the physical similarities , but the exact composition is unknown . The surface conditions on Venus are more extreme than on Earth , with temperatures ranging from 453 to 473 ° C and pressures of 95 bar .

The theory , developed as a result of Enlightenment rationalism , is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will ; an action can only be good if its maxim -- the principle behind it -- is duty to the moral law . Central to Kant 's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative , which acts on all people , regardless of their interests or desires . Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways . His principle of universalizability requires that , for an action to be permissible , it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring . If a contradiction occurs the act violates Aristotle 's \`\` Non-contradiction '' concept which states that just actions can not lead to contradictions . Kant 's formulation of humanity , the second section of the Categorical Imperative , states that as an end in itself humans are required never to treat others merely as a means to an end , but always , additionally , as ends in themselves . The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will , while Kant 's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom . Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties . A perfect duty , such as the duty not to lie , always holds true ; an imperfect duty , such as the duty to give to charity , can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place ."},{"query":"what is america's national debt right now","short_answer":"a combined total gross national debt of $19.8 trillion","abstract":"The national debt of the United States is the amount owed by the federal government of the United States .

It is the energy associated with the motion and position of an object .

If an object is moved in the opposite direction of a conservative net force , the potential energy will increase and if the speed ( not the velocity ) of the object is changed , the kinetic energy of the object is changed as well . In all real systems , however , nonconservative forces , like frictional forces , will be present , but often they are of negligible values and the mechanical energy 's being constant can therefore be a useful approximation . In elastic collisions , the mechanical energy is conserved but in inelastic collisions , some mechanical energy is converted into heat .

The U.S. involvement in South Vietnam stemmed from 20 long years of political and economic action . These had the common incentive of ending the growing communist domination in Vietnam . At the time , French forces , allies of the U.S. , were backed by America -- President Harry S. Truman provided progressively increasing amounts of financial and military assistance to French forces fighting in Vietnam . From the spring of 1950 , their involvement increased from just assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states ( Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia ) . Eventually , U.S. missions were carried out at a more constant rate by sending out increasing number of military assistance from the United States . Their main intent was to restrict the Communist domination that was present in the government of Vietnam as it would soon lead to a chain of neighbouring countries adopting the same .

This theory was advanced by Albert Bandura as an extension of his social learning theory . The theory states that when people observe a model performing a behavior and the consequences of that behavior , they remember the sequence of events and use this information to guide subsequent behaviors . Observing a model can also prompt the viewer to engage in behavior they already learned . In other words , people do not learn new behaviors solely by trying them and either succeeding or failing , but rather , the survival of humanity is dependent upon the replication of the actions of others . Depending on whether people are rewarded or punished for their behavior and the outcome of the behavior , the observer may choose to replicate behavior modeled .

As a key partner in the agreement , the effects that NAFTA has had on the Mexican economy is essential to understanding NAFTA on a whole . A key factor in this discussion is the way the Agreement was presented to Mexico ; namely , that it would increase development of the Mexican economy by providing more middle class jobs that would enable more Mexicans to lift themselves out of the lower classes . Thus , wages , employment , attitudes , and migration all present essential areas of analyses to understand effects NAFTA has had on the Mexican economy . The overall economic effects of NAFTA on the Mexican economy have been mild in light of the promises made about the deal when it was being negotiated . Economic growth has been steady at around two percent , but that growth is far from the growth the deal was supposed to bring . However , NAFTA has boosted foreign investment in Mexico , and it has allowed Mexico to boost exports which now compose a large portion of the Mexican GDP . NAFTA has had a mild effect on employment , and wages have largely remained static over the years that NAFTA has been in place . Finally , Mexicans overall have a critical view towards the trade deal , but are generally opposed to a complete repeal of the law ."},{"query":"how many discs in game of thrones season 4","short_answer":"5","abstract":"The fourth season of the fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones premiered in the United States on HBO on April 6 , 2014 , and concluded on June 15 , 2014 .

They are far lighter and thinner than traditional cathode ray tube ( CRT ) television sets and video displays and are usually less than 10 centimetres ( 3.9 in ) thick . Flat - panel displays can be divided into two display device categories : volatile and static . Volatile displays require that pixels be periodically electronically refreshed to retain their state ( e.g. , liquid - crystal displays ( LCD ) ) . A volatile display only shows an image when it has battery or AC mains power . Static flat - panel displays rely on materials whose color states are bistable ( e.g. , e-book reader tablets from Sony ) , and as such , flat - panel displays retain the text or images on the screen even when the power is off . As of 2016 , flat - panel displays have almost completely replaced old CRT displays . In many 2010 - era applications , specifically small portable devices such as laptops , mobile phones , smartphones , digital cameras , camcorders , point - and - shoot cameras , and pocket video cameras , any display disadvantages of flat - panels ( as compared with CRTs ) are made up for by portability advantages ( thinness and lightweightness ) ."},{"query":"has a nfl team ever played at home for the super bowl","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Super Bowl curse or Super Bowl hangover is a phrase that refers to one of three phenomena that may occur in the National Football League ( NFL ) .
