The height and width of each image , or level , in the mipmap is a power of two smaller than the previous level . Mipmaps do not have to be square . They are intended to increase rendering speed and reduce aliasing artifacts . A high - resolution mipmap image is used for high - density samples , such as for objects close to the camera . Lower - resolution images are used as the object appears farther away . This is a more efficient way of downfiltering ( minifying ) a texture than sampling all texels in the original texture that would contribute to a screen pixel ; it is faster to take a constant number of samples from the appropriately downfiltered textures . Mipmaps are widely used in 3D computer games , flight simulators , other 3D imaging systems for texture filtering and 2D as well as 3D GIS software . Their use is known as mipmapping . The letters \`\` MIP '' in the name are an acronym of the Latin phrase multum in parvo , meaning \`\` much in little '' . Since mipmaps , by definition , are pre-allocated , additional storage space is required to take advantage of them . They are also related to wavelet compression .

The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the body , then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond to such events . Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago . In vertebrates it consists of two main parts , the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord . The PNS consists mainly of nerves , which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons , that connect the CNS to every other part of the body . Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves , while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent . Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves . The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems , the somatic , autonomic , and enteric nervous systems . Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement . The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy , while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state . The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system . Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily .

This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors .

For instance , chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy when a stick of dynamite explodes . If one adds up all the chemical energy that is expended in the explosion , one will get the exact amount of kinetic energy that is generated . Classically , conservation of energy was distinct from conservation of mass ; however , special relativity showed that mass could be converted to energy and vice versa by E = mc , and science now takes the view that mass -- energy is conserved ."},{"query":"breaking bad season 4 episode 10 online free","short_answer":"","abstract":"Breaking Bad is an American neo-western crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan .

The historical ties between the two countries are long and complex , including conquest , wars , and alliances at various points in history . The Roman era saw both areas , except Scotland and Northern Ireland , conquered by Rome , whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day , and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas ; however , the language barrier remained . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history , as well as the English language . In the medieval period , the countries were often bitter enemies , with both nations ' monarchs claiming control over France . The Hundred Years ' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory . Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815 . After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better . Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente cordiale , particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II , wherein both countries fought against Germany , and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis . Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO , the western military alliance led by the United States . In recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship , especially on defence and foreign policy issues ; the two countries tend , however , to disagree on a range of other matters , most notably the European Union . The British press relishes the chance to refer to France and Britain as \`\` historic rivals '' or emphasize the perceived ever - lasting competition that still opposes the two countries ."},{"query":"who eliminated in bigg boss telugu season 1","short_answer":"","abstract":"Bigg Boss Telugu is the Telugu - language version of the reality TV programme Bigg Boss broadcast in Star Maa , India"},{"query":"who plays the white rabbit girl in the matrix","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"what is the northern most town in scotland","short_answer":"Thurso","abstract":"Thurso ( pronounced / ˈθɜːrsoʊ / , Scots : Thursa , Scottish Gaelic : Inbhir Theòrsa ( ˈiɲɪɾj ˈhjɔːrsə ) ) is a town and former burgh on the north coast of the Highland council area of Scotland .

Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure . The largest low - pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale ( the synoptic scale ) . Warm - core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale . Mesocyclones , tornadoes and dust devils lie within the smaller mesoscale . Upper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low , and can pinch off from the base of the tropical upper tropospheric trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere . Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets , such as Mars and Neptune . Cyclogenesis describes the process of cyclone formation and intensification . Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones . These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies . Later in their life cycle , extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems . A cyclone 's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream ."},{"query":"show me a map of west chester pennsylvania","short_answer":"","abstract":"West Chester is a borough and the county seat of Chester County , Pennsylvania , in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania .

Some 80 percent of its area experiences rains of 750 millimetres ( 30 in ) or more a year . However , this rain is not uniform in time or geography . Most of the rains occur during its monsoon seasons ( June to September ) , with the north east and north receiving far more rains than India 's west and south . Other than rains , the melting of snow over the Himalayas after winter season feeds the northern rivers to varying degrees . The southern rivers , however experience more flow variability over the year . For the Himalayan basin , this leads to flooding in some months and water scarcity in others . Despite extensive river system , safe clean drinking water as well as irrigation water supplies for sustainable agriculture are in shortage across India , in part because it has , as yet , harnessed a small fraction of its available and recoverable surface water resource . India harnessed 761 cubic kilometres ( 183 cu mi ) ( 20 percent ) of its water resources in 2010 , part of which came from unsustainable use of groundwater . Of the water it withdrew from its rivers and groundwater wells , India dedicated about 688 cubic kilometres ( 165 cu mi ) to irrigation , 56 cubic kilometres ( 13 cu mi ) to municipal and drinking water applications and 17 cubic kilometres ( 4.1 cu mi ) to industry ."},{"query":"who played mr holland in mr holland's opus","short_answer":"Richard Dreyfuss","abstract":"Mr. Holland 's Opus is a 1995 American drama film directed by Stephen Herek , produced by Ted Field , Robert W.

Scientists and conservationists need a species definition which allows them to work , regardless of the theoretical difficulties . If as Linnaeus thought , species were fixed , there would be no problem , but evolutionary processes cause species to change continually , and to grade into one another . A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring , typically by sexual reproduction . While this definition is often adequate , when looked at more closely it is problematic . For example , with hybridisation , in a species complex of hundreds of similar microspecies , or in a ring species , the boundaries between closely related species become unclear . Among organisms that reproduce only asexually , the concept of a reproductive species breaks down , and each clone is potentially a microspecies . Problems also arise when dealing with fossils , since reproduction can not be examined ; the concept of the chronospecies is therefore used in palaeontology . Other ways of defining species include their karyotype , DNA sequence , morphology , behaviour or ecological niche ."},{"query":"what is the most spoken language in the world","short_answer":"","abstract":"This article ranks human languages by their number of native speakers ."},{"query":"when do new episodes of blue bloods air","short_answer":"December 1 , 2017|December 8 , 2017","abstract":"Blue Bloods is an American police procedural television series created by Robin Green and Mitchell Burgess .

If the rate of gene flow is high enough , then two populations are considered to have equivalent genetic diversity and therefore effectively be a single population . It has been shown that it takes only \`\` One migrant per generation '' to prevent populations from diverging due to drift . Gene flow is an important mechanism for transferring genetic diversity among populations . Migrants change the distribution of genetic diversity within the populations , by modifying the allele frequencies ( the proportion of members carrying a particular variant of a gene ) . High rates of gene flow can reduce the genetic differentiation between the two groups , increasing homogeneity . For this reason , gene flow has been thought to constrain speciation by combining the gene pools of the groups , thus preventing the development of differences in genetic variation that would have led to full speciation . In some cases migration may also result in the addition of novel genetic variants to the gene pool of a species or population ."},{"query":"who does sansa marry on game of thrones","short_answer":"Tyrion Lannister","abstract":"Sansa Stark is a fictional character created by American author George R.R.

Stress is the body 's method of reacting to a challenge . Stimuli that alter an organism 's environment are responded to by multiple systems in the body . The autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis are two major systems that respond to stress . The sympathoadrenal medullary ( SAM ) axis may activate the fight or flight response through the sympathetic nervous system , which dedicates energy to more relevant bodily systems to acute adaption to stress , while the parasympathetic nervous system returns the body to homeostasis . The second major physiological stress , the HPA axis regulates the release of cortisol , which influences many bodily functions such as metabolic , psychological and immunological functions . The SAM and HPA axes are regulated by a wide variety of brain regions , including the limbic system , prefrontal cortex , amygdala , hypothalamus , and stria terminalis . Through these mechanisms , stress can alter memory functions , reward , immune function , metabolism and susceptibility to diseases . Definitions of stress differ ; however , one system proposed by Elliot and Eisdorfer suggests five types of stress . The five types of stress are labeled \`\` acute time limited stressors '' , \`\` brief naturalistic stressors '' , \`\` stressful event sequence '' , \`\` chronic stressors '' , and \`\` distant stressors '' . Acute time limited stressors involve short term challenges , while , on the other hand , brief naturalistic stressors involve an event that is normal but nevertheless challenging . Stressful event sequences are a stressor that occur , and continue to yield stress into the immediate future . Chronic stressors involve exposure to a long - term stressor and a distant stressor is a stressor that is n't immediate ."},{"query":"who sang ill never fall in love again","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` I 'll Never Fall in Love Again '' is a popular song by composer Burt Bacharach and lyricist Hal David that was written for the 1968 musical Promises , Promises .

The free energy created is then used to reduce a chain of nearby electron acceptors , which have subsequently higher redox - potentials .

Snowboarding was one of five new sports or disciplines added to the Winter Olympic program between 1992 and 2002 , and was the only one not to have been a previous medal or demonstration event . In 1998 , four events , two for men and two for women , were held in two specialities : the giant slalom , a downhill event similar to giant slalom skiing ; and the half - pipe , in which competitors perform tricks while going from one side of a semi-circular ditch to the other . Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the men 's giant slalom and became the first athlete to win a gold medal in snowboarding . Rebagliati was briefly stripped of his medal by the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) after testing positive for marijuana . However , the IOC 's decision was reverted following an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Association . For the 2002 Winter Olympics , giant slalom was expanded to add head - to - head racing and was renamed parallel giant slalom . In 2006 , a third event , the snowboard cross , was held for the first time . In this event , competitors race against each other down a course with jumps , beams and other obstacles .

In addition to the observation of behavior , learning also occurs through the observation of rewards and punishments , a process known as vicarious reinforcement .

In bacteria , which lack a cell nucleus , the cell cycle is divided into the B , C , and D periods . The B period extends from the end of cell division to the beginning of DNA replication .

In cells with a nucleus , as in eukaryotes , the cell cycle is also divided into three periods : interphase , the mitotic ( M ) phase , and cytokinesis . During interphase , the cell grows , accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis , preparing it for cell division and duplicating its DNA . During the mitotic phase , the chromosomes separate .

The song tells the story of an old woman who swallowed increasingly large animals , each to catch the previously swallowed animal . There are many variations of phrasing in the lyrics , especially for the description of swallowing each animal . The spider and fly are described in each verse , but the other animals are only described when they are introduced starting with the bird . The absurdity stems from the increasingly improbable solutions that only worsen the initial problem and are more likely to cause the woman 's death : the logic of swallowing of even more animals of preposterous sizes without dying , contrasted with the expected , matter - of - fact recounting of her death from swallowing an animal larger than herself , when in fact the swallowing of any animal as a solution was absurd . This song for children appeals to their initial logic that a fly can be swallowed by an old lady . A spider would also be seen as logical and physically possible . As you get to the bird , it slowly becomes clear for the child that it 's part of an imaginary scenario leading to a whole horse being swallowed . The last sentence brings the child back to a rational understanding that the old lady is in fact dead of course as physically this is impossible making place for children 's amusement and laughter ."},{"query":"who died in harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 movie","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"meaning of joseph's coat of many colours","short_answer":"","abstract":"In the Hebrew Bible , the coat of many colors ( Hebrew : כְּתֹנֶת פַּסִּים ‬ ‎ kəṯōneṯ passîm ) is the name for the garment that Joseph owned , which was given to him by his father , Jacob ."},{"query":"when does a baby turn one years old","short_answer":"","abstract":"East Asian age reckoning is a concept and practice that originated in China and is widely used by other cultures in East Asia .

These land divisions were formed following the Norman invasion of Ireland in imitation of the counties then in use as units of local government in the Kingdom of England .

The principal function of the county was to impose royal control in the areas of taxation , security and the administration of justice at the local level . Cambro - Norman control was initially limited to the southeastern parts of Ireland ; a further four centuries elapsed before the entire island was shired . At the same time , the now obsolete concept of county corporate elevated a small number of towns and cities to a status which was deemed to be no less important than the existing counties in which they lay . This double control mechanism of 32 counties plus 10 counties corporate remained unchanged for a little over two centuries until the early 19th century , since then counties have been adapted and in some cases divided by legislation to meet new administrative and political requirements ."},{"query":"where did the name milky chance come from","short_answer":"","abstract":"Milky Chance is a German folk group originating from Kassel .

The main function of the SR is to store calcium ions ( Ca ) . Calcium ion levels are kept relatively constant , with the concentration of calcium ions within a cell being 100,000 times smaller than the concentration of calcium ions outside the cell . This means that small increases in calcium ions within the cell are easily detected and can bring about important cellular changes ( the calcium is said to be a second messenger ; see calcium in biology for more details ) . Calcium is used to make calcium carbonate ( found in chalk ) and calcium phosphate , two compounds that the body uses to make teeth and bones . This means that too much calcium within the cells can lead to hardening ( calcification ) of certain intracellular structures , including the mitochondria , leading to cell death . Therefore , it is vital that calcium ion levels are controlled tightly , and can be released into the cell when necessary and then removed from the cell ."},{"query":"what are some weaknesses a person could have","short_answer":"","abstract":"Strengths and weaknesses generally refer to a person 's character ."},{"query":"when does the next book of trials of apollo come out","short_answer":"Fall 2019","abstract":"The Trials of Apollo is a pentalogy of fantasy adventure and mythological fiction novels written by American author Rick Riordan that collectively form a sequel to the Heroes of Olympus series .

This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese .

In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy .

In nature complementarity is the base principle of DNA replication and transcription as it is a property shared between two DNA or RNA sequences , such that when they are aligned antiparallel to each other , the nucleotide bases at each position in the sequences will be complementary , much like looking in the mirror and seeing the reverse of things . This complementary base pairing allows cells to copy information from one generation to another and even find and repair damage to the information stored in the sequences . The degree of complementarity between two nucleic acid strands may vary , from complete complementarity ( each nucleotide is across from its opposite ) to no complementarity ( each nucleotide is not across from its opposite ) and determines the stability of the sequences to be together . Furthermore , various DNA repair functions as well as regulatory functions are based on base pair complementarity . In biotechnology , the principle of base pair complementarity allows the generation of DNA hybrids between RNA and DNA , and opens the door to modern tools such as cDNA libraries . While most complementarity is seen between two separate strings of DNA or RNA , it is also possible for a sequence to have internal complementarity resulting in the sequence binding to itself in a folded configuration ."},{"query":"when was who let the dogs out made","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"which curve best describes survivorship that is independent of age","short_answer":"","abstract":"A survivorship curve is a graph showing the number or proportion of individuals surviving to each age for a given species or group ( e.g. males or females ) .

Organic matter , another important element , varies on quantity on different soils . This provokes positive and negative effects or reactions on the soil . The strength of soil structure decreases with the presence of organic matter , creating weak bearing capacities . Organic matter condenses and or settles in different ways under certain conditions , such as roadbeds and foundations . The skeletal structure becomes affected once the soil is dewatered . The soil 's volume substantially decreases .

A rift valley is formed on a divergent plate boundary , a crustal extension , a spreading apart of the surface , which is subsequently further deepened by the forces of erosion . When the tensional forces were strong enough to cause the plate to split apart , a center block dropped between the two blocks at its flanks , forming a graben . The drop of the center creates the nearly parallel steeply dipping walls of a rift valley when it is new . That feature is the beginning of the rift valley , but as the process continues , the valley widens , until it becomes a large basin that fills with sediment from the rift walls and the surrounding area . One of the best known examples of this process is the East African Rift . On Earth , rifts can occur at all elevations , from the sea floor to plateaus and mountain ranges in continental crust or in oceanic crust . They are often associated with a number of adjoining subsidiary or co-extensive valleys , which are typically considered part of the principal rift valley geologically ."},{"query":"who was the first nigerian musician that won a prize and the year","short_answer":"","abstract":"The following is a list of Grammy Awards winners and nominees from Nigeria :"},{"query":"how did jimmy's brother on better call saul","short_answer":"","abstract":"Charles Lindbergh \`\` Chuck '' McGill , Jr. , is a fictional character who appears in the crime drama television series Better Call Saul , a spin - off prequel of Breaking Bad .
