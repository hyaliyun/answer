Taking its name from the Greek θερμός ( pronounced thermos ) meaning heat , the thermosphere begins about 85 kilometres ( 53 mi ) above the Earth .

Crowdsourcing is distinguished from outsourcing in that the work can come from an undefined public ( instead of being commissioned from a specific , named group ) and in that crowdsourcing includes a mix of bottom - up and top - down processes . Advantages of using crowdsourcing may include improved costs , speed , quality , flexibility , scalability , or diversity . Crowdsourcing in the form of idea competitions or innovation contests provides a way for organizations to learn beyond what their \`\` base of minds '' of employees provides ( e.g. , LEGO Ideas ) . Crowdsourcing can also involve rather tedious \`\` microtasks '' that are performed in parallel by large , paid crowds ( e.g. , Amazon Mechanical Turk ) . Crowdsourcing has also been used for noncommercial work and to develop common goods ( e.g. , Wikipedia ) ."},{"query":"who was in charge of the spanish missions","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"what is the name of a six-sided polygon","short_answer":"hexagon","abstract":"In geometry , a hexagon ( from Greek ἕξ hex , \`\` six '' and γωνία , gonía , \`\` corner , angle '' ) is a six - sided polygon or 6 - gon .

This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese .

This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy . The destruction of Athens ' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war , and Athens surrendered in the following year .

If the rate of gene flow is high enough , then two populations are considered to have equivalent genetic diversity and therefore effectively be a single population . It has been shown that it takes only \`\` One migrant per generation '' to prevent populations from diverging due to drift . Gene flow is an important mechanism for transferring genetic diversity among populations . Migrants change the distribution of genetic diversity within the populations , by modifying the allele frequencies ( the proportion of members carrying a particular variant of a gene ) . High rates of gene flow can reduce the genetic differentiation between the two groups , increasing homogeneity . For this reason , gene flow has been thought to constrain speciation by combining the gene pools of the groups , thus preventing the development of differences in genetic variation that would have led to full speciation . In some cases migration may also result in the addition of novel genetic variants to the gene pool of a species or population ."},{"query":"who sings they shoot horses don't they","short_answer":"Racing Cars|Quickspace","abstract":"They Shoot Horses , Do n't They ? may refer to :"},{"query":"who plays hope in the originals season 5","short_answer":"Danielle Rose Russell","abstract":""},{"query":"what is the purpose of a homeowners association","short_answer":"marketing , managing , and selling homes and lots in a residential subdivision","abstract":"In the United States , a homeowner association ( or homeowners ' association , abbreviated HOA , sometimes referred to as a property owners ' association or POA ) is a private association often formed by a real estate developer for the purpose of marketing , managing , and selling homes and lots in a residential subdivision .

Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year . Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4 -- 9 cm / year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm / year ."},{"query":"where are neurons found in the human body","short_answer":"","abstract":"A neuron , also known as a neurone ( British spelling ) and nerve cell , is an electrically excitable cell that receives , processes , and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals .

This theoretical perspective was first introduced by Mark Leary and colleagues in 1995 and later expanded on by Kirkpatrick and Ellis . In Leary 's research , the idea of self - esteem as a sociometer is discussed in depth . This theory was created as a response to psychological phenomenon i.e. social emotions , inter - and intra - personal behaviors , self - serving biases , and reactions to rejection . Based on this theory , self - esteem is a measure of effectiveness in social relations and interactions that monitors acceptance and / or rejection from others . With this , an emphasis is placed on relational value , which is the degree to which a person regards his or her relationship with another , and how it affects day - to - day life . Confirmed by various studies and research , if a person is deemed having relational value , they are more likely to have higher self - esteem . According to Leary , there are five main groups associated with relational value that are classified as those affording the greatest impact on an individual . They are : 1 ) macro-level , i.e. , communities , 2 ) instrumental coalitions , i.e. , teams , committees , 3 ) mating relationships , 4 ) kin relationships , and 5 ) friendships . A study was conducted to see just how much people depend on peers and outside factors and relational values to regulate their life . The objective of the study was to pick groups for an activity based on the evaluations given by the students . In the study , two groups were assigned . Both groups consisted of college students that submitted and were subjected to a peer evaluation . The difference being that the control group of students chose if they 1 ) wanted to interact with the person or 2 ) dissociated from the person . Previously asked , some students stated that they were indifferent or did not care what others ' opinions of them were . However , when results were analyzed there was a great deal of fluctuation in overall self - esteem . Those who were placed in the second group ( of dissociation ) , receiving a low relational value , displayed a lowered self - esteem . As a result , this compromised the way they assessed a / the situation . In the first group , where perceived relational value was high , self - esteem was also high . This provides some evidence for an evolutionary basis in the fundamental human need for inclusion in a group , and the burden of being on the outskirts of social acceptance ."},{"query":"who is given veera madakarinayaka award in kho kho","short_answer":"","abstract":"Madakari Nayaka or Madakari Nayaka V was the greatest and the last ruler of Chitradurga , and belonged to Nayaka ( Valmiki ) community in Chitradurga , Karnataka India .

They are tyrosine - based hormones that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism . T and T are partially composed of iodine . A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T and T , enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre . The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine ( T ) , which has a longer half - life than T. In humans , the ratio of T to T released into the blood is sometimes claimed to be quite high , but thyroid removal patient data suggests it to vary between 4 : 1 to 2 : 1 , the average being 100 : 36 ( roughly 2.8 : 1 ) . T is converted to the active T ( three to four times more potent than T ) within cells by deiodinases ( 5 ' - iodinase ) . These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine ( T a ) and thyronamine ( T a ) . All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium - containing enzymes , thus dietary selenium is essential for T production . Edward Calvin Kendall was responsible for the isolation of thyroxine in 1915 ."},{"query":"meaning of the song oh what a night","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` December , 1963 ( Oh , What a Night ) '' is a song by the Four Seasons , written by original Four Seasons keyboard player Bob Gaudio and his future wife Judy Parker , produced by Gaudio , and included on the group 's album , Who Loves You ( 1975 ) ."},{"query":"which player has got man of the match award in 1992 world cup final","short_answer":"","abstract":"The major prestigious awards handed out in and in the Final awards ."},{"query":"where is the blue mosque located in turkey","short_answer":"Istanbul","abstract":"The Sultan Ahmed Mosque or Sultan Ahmet Mosque ( Turkish : Sultan Ahmet Camii ) is a historic mosque located in Istanbul , Turkey .

Most radar detectors are used so the driver can reduce the car 's speed before being ticketed for speeding . In general sense , only emitting technologies , like doppler RADAR , or LIDAR can be detected . Visual speed estimating techniques , like ANPR or VASCAR can not be detected in daytime , but technically vulnerable to detection at night , when IR spotlight is used . There are no reports that piezo sensors can be detected . LIDAR devices require an optical - band sensor , although many modern detectors include LIDAR sensors . Most of today 's radar detectors detect signals across a variety of wavelength bands : usually X , K , and K . In Europe the K band is common as well . The past success of radar detectors was based on the fact that radio - wave beam can not be narrow - enough , so the detector usually senses stray and scattered radiation , giving the driver time to slow down . Based on focused laser - beam , LIDAR technology is deprived of this shortcoming ; however requires precise aiming . Modern police radars incorporate formidable computing power , producing minimum of ultra-short pulses , reusing wide beam for multi-target measurement , which renders most detectors useless .

In its broadest definition , a codependent is someone who can not function from their innate self and whose thinking and behavior is instead organized around another person , or even a process , or substance . In this context , people who are addicted to a substance , like drugs , or a process , like gambling or sex , can also be considered codependent . In its most narrow definition , it requires one person to be physically or psychologically addicted , such as to heroin , and the second person to be psychologically dependent on that behavior . Some users of the codependency concept use the word as an alternative to using the concept of dysfunctional families , without statements that classify it as a disease ."},{"query":"fleetwood mac heroes are hard to find review","short_answer":"","abstract":"Heroes Are Hard to Find is the ninth studio album by British - American rock band Fleetwood Mac , released on 13 September 1974 .

At the time , French forces , allies of the U.S. , were backed by America -- President Harry S. Truman provided progressively increasing amounts of financial and military assistance to French forces fighting in Vietnam . From the spring of 1950 , their involvement increased from just assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states ( Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia ) . Eventually , U.S. missions were carried out at a more constant rate by sending out increasing number of military assistance from the United States . Their main intent was to restrict the Communist domination that was present in the government of Vietnam as it would soon lead to a chain of neighbouring countries adopting the same . This would have resulted in a change in balance of power throughout Southeast Asia . Essentially , the U.S. saw their major security interests being disturbed due to the rise of the communist expansion and strived to take any measure to end it .

In the case of electrons in atoms , it can be stated as follows : it is impossible for two electrons of a poly - electron atom to have the same values of the four quantum numbers : n , the principal quantum number , l , the angular momentum quantum number , m , the magnetic quantum number , and m , the spin quantum number .
