Proteins are polymers -- specifically polypeptides -- formed from sequences of amino acids , the monomers of the polymer . A single amino acid monomer may also be called a residue indicating a repeating unit of a polymer . Proteins form by amino acids undergoing condensation reactions , in which the amino acids lose one water molecule per reaction in order to attach to one another with a peptide bond . By convention , a chain under 30 amino acids is often identified as a peptide , rather than a protein . To be able to perform their biological function , proteins fold into one or more specific spatial conformations driven by a number of non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding , ionic interactions , Van der Waals forces , and hydrophobic packing . To understand the functions of proteins at a molecular level , it is often necessary to determine their three - dimensional structure . This is the topic of the scientific field of structural biology , which employs techniques such as X-ray crystallography , NMR spectroscopy , and dual polarisation interferometry to determine the structure of proteins ."},{"query":"who among these is a former indian cricketer","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"beauty and the beast to be human again","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Human Again '' is a song originally written for , deleted from , and later restored to the 1991 Disney animated musical Beauty and the Beast .

For example , Jonah may be seen as the type of Christ in that he emerged from the fish 's belly and thus appeared to rise from death . In the fullest version of the theory of typology , the whole purpose of the Old Testament is viewed as merely the provision of types for Christ , the antitype or fulfillment . The theory began in the Early Church , was at its most influential in the High Middle Ages , and continued to be popular , especially in Calvinism , after the Protestant Reformation , but in subsequent periods has been given less emphasis . One exception to this is the Christian Brethren of the 19th and 20th centuries , where typology was much favoured and the subject of numerous books . Notably , in the Eastern Orthodox Church , typology is still a common and frequent exegetical tool , mainly due to that church 's great emphasis on continuity in doctrinal presentation through all historical periods . Typology was frequently used in early Christian art , where type and antitype would be depicted in contrasting positions . The usage of the terminology has expanded into the secular sphere ; for example , \`\` Geoffrey de Montbray ( d. 1093 ) , Bishop of Coutances , a right - hand man of William the Conqueror , was a type of the great feudal prelate , warrior and administrator '' ."},{"query":"what is a section of a song called","short_answer":"","abstract":"Song structure or the musical forms of songs in traditional music and music are typically sectional , repeating forms used in songs , such as strophic form and is a part of the songwriting process .

Amylase is present in the saliva of humans and some other mammals , where it begins the chemical process of digestion .

Plants and some bacteria also produce amylase . As diastase , amylase was the first enzyme to be discovered and isolated ( by Anselme Payen in 1833 ) .

Much of the literary record of Japanese poetry begins when Japanese poets encountered Chinese poetry during the Tang dynasty ( although the Chinese classic anthology of poetry , Shijing , was well known by the literati of Japan by the 6th century ) . Under the influence of the Chinese poets of this era Japanese began to compose poetry in Chinese kanshi ) ; and , as part of this tradition , poetry in Japan tended to be intimately associated with pictorial painting , partly because of the influence of Chinese arts , and the tradition of the use of ink and brush for both writing and drawing . It took several hundred years to digest the foreign impact and make it an integral part of Japanese culture and to merge this kanshi poetry into a Japanese language literary tradition , and then later to develop the diversity of unique poetic forms of native poetry , such as waka , haikai , and other more Japanese poetic specialties . For example , in the Tale of Genji both kanshi and waka are frequently mentioned . The history of Japanese poetry goes from an early semi-historical / mythological phase , through the early Old Japanese literature inclusions , just before the Nara period , the Nara period itself ( 710 to 794 ) , the Heian period ( 794 to 1185 ) , the Kamakura period ( 1185 to 1333 ) , and so on , up through the poetically important Edo period ( 1603 and 1867 , also known as \`\` Tokugawa '' ) and modern times ; however , the history of poetry often is different than socio - political history ."},{"query":"what is mission statement for engro chemical pakistan limited","short_answer":"","abstract":"Muhammad Husnain ( Chairman )"},{"query":"who does bill hader voice on south park","short_answer":"","abstract":"South Park is an American adult animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone who also do the majority of the voices .

At these high altitudes , the residual atmospheric gases sort into strata according to molecular mass ( see turbosphere ) . Thermospheric temperatures increase with altitude due to absorption of highly energetic solar radiation .

In the presence of a charged body , an insulated conductor develops a positive charge on one end and a negative charge on the other end . Induction was discovered by British scientist John Canton in 1753 and Swedish professor Johan Carl Wilcke in 1762 . Electrostatic generators , such as the Wimshurst machine , the Van de Graaff generator and the electrophorus , use this principle . Due to induction , the electrostatic potential ( voltage ) is constant at any point throughout a conductor . Electrostatic Induction is also responsible for the attraction of light nonconductive objects , such as balloons , paper or styrofoam scraps , to static electric charges .

By this sacrament Christians believe they are freed from sins committed after Baptism . The sacrament of Penance is considered the normal way to be absolved from mortal sin , by which one would otherwise possibly condemn oneself to Hell . Catholic theology regarding the forgiveness of sins debates whether Christ at the judgment of the individual after their death would allow those with unconfessed mortal sins a chance to repent and save themselves - especially those who had not made plans to confess , or were not mentally ill , coerced , or suicidal ( which the Church has said all would reduces one 's culpability ) . While persons with certain unconfessed mortal sins that were under some form of censure still at their death might not be allowed a Catholic Funeral Mass and burial rites , and while Catholics with unconfessed mortal sins may not receive Communion ( unless in some circumstances , ameliorating factors were present ) , these matters , though related , are not the same as whether an individual with unconfessed serious sins is condemned to Hell ."},{"query":"how many days has it been since michigan beat ohio state","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Michigan -- Ohio State football rivalry , referred to as The Game by some followers , is an American college football rivalry game played annually between the University of Michigan Wolverines and the Ohio State University Buckeyes .

The main function of the SR is to store calcium ions ( Ca ) . Calcium ion levels are kept relatively constant , with the concentration of calcium ions within a cell being 100,000 times smaller than the concentration of calcium ions outside the cell . This means that small increases in calcium ions within the cell are easily detected and can bring about important cellular changes ( the calcium is said to be a second messenger ; see calcium in biology for more details ) . Calcium is used to make calcium carbonate ( found in chalk ) and calcium phosphate , two compounds that the body uses to make teeth and bones . This means that too much calcium within the cells can lead to hardening ( calcification ) of certain intracellular structures , including the mitochondria , leading to cell death . Therefore , it is vital that calcium ion levels are controlled tightly , and can be released into the cell when necessary and then removed from the cell ."},{"query":"when does episode 3 of the deuce come out","short_answer":"September 24 , 2017","abstract":"The Deuce is an American drama television series set in and around Times Square , New York City in the early 1970s .

After a failed English attempt to settle Virginia in the 1580s by Walter Raleigh , permanent English settlement began in Virginia with Jamestown , Virginia , in 1607 . The Virginia Company colony was looking for gold but failed and the colonists could barely feed themselves . The famine during the harsh winter of 1609 forced the colonists to eat leather from their clothes and boots and resort to cannibalism .

After 1662 , the colony turned black slavery into a hereditary racial caste . By 1750 , the primary cultivators of the cash crop were West African slaves . While the plantations thrived because of the high demand for tobacco , most white settlers raised their families on subsistence farms .

The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , a number of correlated and more specific primary factors are claimed .

One of the most well - known and heavily studied hotspots in the world , the Hawaii plume is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian -- Emperor seamount chain , a chain of volcanoes over 5,800 kilometres ( 3,600 mi ) long . Four of these volcanoes are active , two are dormant , and more than 123 are extinct , many having since been ground beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls . The chain extends from south of the island of Hawai ʻi to the edge of the Aleutian Trench , near the eastern edge of Russia . While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries , the Hawaii hotspot is located far from plate boundaries . The classic hotspot theory , first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson , proposes that a single , fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then , cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate , become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years . According to this theory , the nearly 60 ° bend where the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain meet was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate . In 2003 , fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory , suggesting that hotspots are mobile , not fixed , and that the 47 - million - year - old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot 's motion rather than the plate 's ."},{"query":"the one and only ivan sequence of events","short_answer":"","abstract":"The One and Only Ivan is a children 's novel written by K.A.
