After a failed English attempt to settle Virginia in the 1580s by Walter Raleigh , permanent English settlement began in Virginia with Jamestown , Virginia , in 1607 . The Virginia Company colony was looking for gold but failed and the colonists could barely feed themselves . The famine during the harsh winter of 1609 forced the colonists to eat leather from their clothes and boots and resort to cannibalism . The colony nearly failed until tobacco emerged as a profitable export . It was grown on plantations , using primarily indentured servants for the intensive hand labor involved . After 1662 , the colony turned black slavery into a hereditary racial caste . By 1750 , the primary cultivators of the cash crop were West African slaves . While the plantations thrived because of the high demand for tobacco , most white settlers raised their families on subsistence farms . Warfare with the Virginia Indian nations had been a factor in the 17th century ; after 1700 there was continued conflict with natives east of the Alleghenies , especially in the French and Indian War ( 1754 - 1763 ) , when the tribes were allied with the French .

Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago . In vertebrates it consists of two main parts , the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord . The PNS consists mainly of nerves , which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons , that connect the CNS to every other part of the body . Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves , while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent . Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves . The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems , the somatic , autonomic , and enteric nervous systems . Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement . The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy , while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state . The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system . Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily . Nerves that exit from the cranium are called cranial nerves while those exiting from the spinal cord are called spinal nerves ."},{"query":"what it's like to be me britney spears","short_answer":"","abstract":"Britney is the third studio album by American singer Britney Spears .

Agricultural output grew faster than the population over the century to 1770 , and thereafter productivity remained among the highest in the world . This increase in the food supply contributed to the rapid growth of population in England and Wales , from 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801 , though domestic production gave way increasingly to food imports in the nineteenth century as population more than tripled to over 32 million .

Photosynthetic prokaryotic organisms that produced O as a waste product lived long before the first build - up of free oxygen in the atmosphere , perhaps as early as 3.5 billion years ago . The oxygen they produced would have been rapidly removed from the atmosphere by weathering of reducing minerals , most notably iron . This \`\` mass rusting '' led to the deposition of iron oxide on the ocean floor , forming banded iron formations . Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities about 50 million years before the start of the Great Oxygenation Event . This mass oxygenation of the atmosphere resulted in rapid buildup of free oxygen . At current rates of primary production , today 's concentration of oxygen could be produced by photosynthetic organisms in 2,000 years . In the absence of plants , the rate of oxygen production by photosynthesis was slower in the Precambrian , and the concentrations of O attained were less than 10 % of today 's and probably fluctuated greatly ; oxygen may even have disappeared from the atmosphere again around 1.9 billion years ago . These fluctuations in oxygen concentration had little direct effect on life , with mass extinctions not observed until the appearance of complex life around the start of the Cambrian period , 541 million years ago . The presence of O 2 provided life with new opportunities . Aerobic metabolism is more efficient than anaerobic pathways , and the presence of oxygen undoubtedly created new possibilities for life to explore . Since the start of the Cambrian period , atmospheric oxygen concentrations have fluctuated between 15 % and 35 % of atmospheric volume . The maximum of 35 % was reached towards the end of the Carboniferous period ( about 300 million years ago ) , a peak which may have contributed to the large size of insects and amphibians at that time . Whilst human activities , such as the burning of fossil fuels , affect relative carbon dioxide concentrations , their effect on the much larger concentration of oxygen is less significant ."},{"query":"with 125 182 square miles norway is just a little larger than the state of texas","short_answer":"","abstract":"Houston ( / ˈhjuːstən / ( listen ) HYOO - stən ) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Texas and the fourth-most populous city in the United States .

Scientists and conservationists need a species definition which allows them to work , regardless of the theoretical difficulties . If as Linnaeus thought , species were fixed , there would be no problem , but evolutionary processes cause species to change continually , and to grade into one another . A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring , typically by sexual reproduction . While this definition is often adequate , when looked at more closely it is problematic . For example , with hybridisation , in a species complex of hundreds of similar microspecies , or in a ring species , the boundaries between closely related species become unclear . Among organisms that reproduce only asexually , the concept of a reproductive species breaks down , and each clone is potentially a microspecies . Problems also arise when dealing with fossils , since reproduction can not be examined ; the concept of the chronospecies is therefore used in palaeontology . Other ways of defining species include their karyotype , DNA sequence , morphology , behaviour or ecological niche ."},{"query":"penalty for killing a cat in ancient egypt","short_answer":"","abstract":"Cats ( Felis silvestris catus ) , known in ancient Egypt as \`\` Mau '' , were considered sacred in ancient Egyptian society .

The sample is placed in a magnetic field and the NMR signal is produced by excitation of the nuclei sample with radio waves into nuclear magnetic resonance , which is detected with sensitive radio receivers . The intramolecular magnetic field around an atom in a molecule changes the resonance frequency , thus giving access to details of the electronic structure of a molecule and its individual functional groups . As the fields are unique or highly characteristic to individual compounds , in modern organic chemistry practice , NMR spectroscopy is the definitive method to identify monomolecular organic compounds . Similarly , biochemists use NMR to identify proteins and other complex molecules . Besides identification , NMR spectroscopy provides detailed information about the structure , dynamics , reaction state , and chemical environment of molecules . The most common types of NMR are proton and carbon - 13 NMR spectroscopy , but it is applicable to any kind of sample that contains nuclei possessing spin ."},{"query":"what part of kentucky is the kentucky derby in","short_answer":"Churchill Downs , located on Central Avenue in south Louisville","abstract":"Churchill Downs , located on Central Avenue in south Louisville , Kentucky , United States , is a Thoroughbred racetrack most famous for annually hosting the Kentucky Derby .

They were primarily used to demoralize , injure , and kill entrenched defenders , against whom the indiscriminate and generally very slow - moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective . The types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals , such as tear gas , to lethal agents like phosgene , chlorine , and mustard gas . This chemical warfare was a major component of the first global war and first total war of the 20th century . The killing capacity of gas was limited , with only about ninety thousand fatalities from a total of some 1.3 million casualties caused by gas attacks . Gas was unlike most other weapons of the period because it was possible to develop effective countermeasures , such as gas masks . In the later stages of the war , as the use of gas increased , its overall effectiveness diminished . The widespread use of these agents of chemical warfare , and wartime advances in the composition of high explosives , gave rise to an occasionally expressed view of World War I as \`\` the chemist 's war '' and also the era where \`\` weapons of mass destruction '' were created ."},{"query":"who played ben stone on law & order","short_answer":"Michael Moriarty","abstract":"Michael Moriarty ( born April 5 , 1941 ) is an American - Canadian stage and screen actor and jazz musician .

If goods A and B are complements , an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in ; less of each goods will be demanded .

However , terraria can also be open to the atmosphere rather than being sealed . Terraria are often kept as decorative or ornamental items . Closed terraria create a unique environment for plant growth , as the transparent walls allow for both heat and light to enter the terrarium . The sealed container combined with the heat entering the terrarium allows for the creation of a small scale water cycle . This happens because moisture from both the soil and plants evaporates in the elevated temperatures inside the terrarium . This water vapour then condenses on the walls of the container , and eventually falls back to the plants and soil below . This contributes to creating an ideal environment for growing plants due to the constant supply of water , thereby preventing the plants from becoming over dry . In addition to this , the light that passes through the transparent material of the terrarium allows for the plants within to photosynthesize , a very important aspect of plant growth ."},{"query":"what is the current version of google chrome for windows 7","short_answer":"","abstract":"The following table summarizes the release history for the Google Chrome web browser ."},{"query":"establishment clause of the first amendment to the u.s. constitution","short_answer":"","abstract":"In United States law , the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution , together with that Amendment 's Free Exercise Clause , form the constitutional right of freedom of religion .

It is the result of a tree or tree - like plants having completely transitioned to stone by the process of permineralization . All the organic materials have been replaced with minerals ( mostly a silicate , such as quartz ) , while retaining the original structure of the stem tissue . Unlike other types of fossils which are typically impressions or compressions , petrified wood is a three - dimensional representation of the original organic material . The petrifaction process occurs underground , when wood becomes buried under sediment or volcanic ash and is initially preserved due to a lack of oxygen which inhibits aerobic decomposition . Mineral - laden water flowing through the covering material deposits minerals in the plant 's cells ; as the plant 's lignin and cellulose decay , a stone mold forms in its place . The organic matter needs to become petrified before it decomposes completely . A forest where such material has petrified becomes known as a petrified forest ."},{"query":"where is the energy stored in a fatty acid molecule","short_answer":"","abstract":"Fatty acid metabolism consists of catabolic processes that generate energy , and anabolic processes that create biologically important molecules ( triglycerides , phospholipids , second messengers , local hormones and ketone bodies ) . Fatty acids are a family of molecules classified within the lipid macronutrient class . One role of fatty acids in animal metabolism is energy production , captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . When compared to other macronutrient classes ( carbohydrates and protein ) , fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis , when they are completely oxidized to CO and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle . Fatty acids ( mainly in the form of triglycerides ) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals , and to a lesser extent in plants . In addition , fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed ( the cell wall , and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells , such as the nucleus , the mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , and the Golgi apparatus ) . Fatty acids can also be cleaved , or partially cleaved , from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell , and local hormones in the immediate vicinity of the cell . The prostaglandins made from arachidonic acid stored in the cell membrane , are probably the most well known group of these local hormones ."},{"query":"small fish that live in the pacific ocean","short_answer":"","abstract":"This category contains fish which are native to Pacific ."},{"query":"what episode does negan appear in the walking dead","short_answer":"sixth season finale","abstract":"Negan is a fictional character in the comic book series The Walking Dead and in the television series of the same name .

T and T are partially composed of iodine ( see molecular model ) . A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T and T , enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre . The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine ( T ) , which has a longer half - life than T.
