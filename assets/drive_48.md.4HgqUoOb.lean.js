This error is made when the researcher concludes there is no significant effect when there actually is."},{"question":"When is the power of a statistical test increased?","answer":"The power of a statistical test is increased when the sample size is increased, the effect size is increased, or the significance level is increased. This means the test is more likely to correctly reject the null hypothesis."},{"question":"When is the power of a statistical test decreased?","answer":"The power of a statistical test is decreased when the sample size is decreased, the effect size is decreased, or the significance level is decreased. This means the test is less likely to correctly reject the null hypothesis."},{"question":"When is a one-tailed test used?","answer":"A one-tailed test is used when the hypothesis predicts the direction of the effect. This is useful when the researcher is only interested in whether the effect is in a specific direction."},{"question":"When is a two-tailed test used?","answer":"A two-tailed test is used when the hypothesis predicts a difference but not the direction of the effect. This is useful when the researcher is interested in whether there is any effect, regardless of its direction."},{"question":"When is a null hypothesis rejected?","answer":"A null hypothesis is rejected when the p-value is smaller than the significance level (alpha).

This means there is a low probability of obtaining the sample result if the null hypothesis is true, so the researcher concludes that the null hypothesis is false."},{"question":"When is a confidence level set?","answer":"A confidence level is set by the researcher as a probability threshold (usually 95% or 99%) to determine the range of values that likely includes the true population parameter. This means that if the researcher repeated the study many times, the confidence interval would include the true population parameter in the specified percentage of cases."},{"question":"When is a correlation coefficient significant?","answer":"A correlation coefficient is significant when the p-value associated with the coefficient is smaller than the significance level (alpha).
